She had had no idea who it was thatspoke of such an inconceivable feat, or who “he” was.That first night, when she had perceived the distant, disembodied voices aslittle more than a vague notion, she had grasped that there were people aroundher who didn’t believe, even though she was again living, that she would remainalive through the rest of the night. But now she knew she had; she had remainedalive many more nights, perhaps in answer to desperate prayers and earnest oathswhispered over her that first night.But if she didn’t remember the dying, she remembered the pain before passinginto that great oblivion. The pain, she never forgot. She remembered fightingalone and savagely against all those men, men baring their teeth like a pack ofwild hounds with a hare. She remembered the rain of brutal blows driving her tothe ground, heavy boots slamming into her once she was there, and the sharp snapof bones. She remembered the blood, so much blood, on their fists, on theirboots. She remembered the searing terror of having no breath to gasp at theagony, no breath to cry out against the crushing weight of hurt.Sometime after-whether hours or days, she didn’t know-when she was lying underclean sheets in an unfamiliar bed and had looked up into his gray eyes, she knewthat, for some, the world reserved pain worse than she had suffered.She didn’t know his name. The profound anguish so apparent in his eyes told herbeyond doubt that she should have. More than her own name, more than lifeitself, she knew she should have known his name, but she didn’t. Nothing hadever shamed her more.Thereafter, whenever her own eyes were closed, she saw his, saw not only thehelpless suffering in them but also the light of such fierce hope as could onlybe kindled by righteous love. Somewhere, even in the worst of the darknessblanketing her mind, she refused to let the light in his eyes be extinguished byher failure to will herself to live.At some point, she remembered his name. Most of the time, she remembered it.Sometimes, she didn’t. Sometimes, when pain smothered her, she forgot even herown name.Now, as Kahlan heard men growling his name, she knew it, she knew him. Withtenacious resolution she clung to that name-Richard-and to her memory of hint,of who he was, of everything he meant to her.Even later, when people had feared she would yet die, she knew she wouldlive.She had to, for Richard, her husband. For the child she carried in herwomb. His child. Their child.The sounds of angry men calling Richard by name at last tugged Kahlan’s eyesopen. She squinted against the agony that had been tempered, if not banished,while in the cocoon of sleep. She was greeted by a blush of amber light fillingthe small room around her. Since the light wasn’t bright, she reasoned thatthere must be a covering over a window muting the sunlight, or maybe it wasdusk. Whenever she woke, as now, she not only had no sense of time, but no senseof how long she had been asleep.She worked her tongue against the pasty dryness in her mouth. Her body feltleaden with the thick, lingering slumber. She was as nauseated as the time whenshe was little and had eaten three candy green apples before a boat journey on ahot, windy day. It was hot like that now: summer hot. She struggled to rouseherself fully, but her awaking awareness seemed adrift, bobbing in a vastshadowy sea. Her stomach roiled. She suddenly had to put all her mental effortinto not throwing up. She knew all too well that in her present condition, fewthings hurt more than vomiting. Her eyelids sagged closed again, and shefoundered to a place darker yet.She caught herself, forced her thoughts to the surface, and willed her eyes openagain. She remembered: they gave her herbs to dull the pain and to help hersleep. Richard knew a good deal about herbs. At least the herbs helped her,drift into stuporous sleep. The pain, if not as sharp, still found her there.Slowly, carefully, so as not to twist what felt like double-edged daggersskewered here and there between her ribs, she drew a deeper breath. Thefragrance of balsam and pine filled her lungs, helping to settle her stomach. Itwas not the aroma of trees among other smells in the forest, among damp dirt andtoadstools and cinnamon ferns, but the redolence of trees freshly felled andlimbed. She concentrated on focusing her sight and saw beyond the foot of thebed a wall of pale, newly peeled timber, here and there oozing sap from freshaxe cuts. The wood looked to have been split and hewn in haste, yet its tightfit betrayed a precision only knowledge and experience could bestow.The room was tiny; in the Confessors’ Palace, where she had grown up, a roomthis small would not have qualified as a closet for linens. Moreover, it wouldhave been stone, if not marble. She liked the tiny wooden room; she expectedthat Richard had built it to protect her. It felt almost like his shelteringarms around her. Marble, with its aloof dignity, never comforted her in thatway.Beyond the foot of the bed, she spotted a carving of a bird in flight. It hadbeen sculpted with a few sure strokes of a knife into a log of the wall on aflat spot only a little bigger than her hand. Richard had given her something tolook at. On occasion, sitting around a campfire, she had watched him casuallycarve a face or an animal from a scrap of wood. The bird, soaring on wingsspread wide as it watched over her, conveyed a sense of freedom.Turning her eyes to the right, she saw a brown wool blanket hanging over thedoorway. From beyond the doorway came fragments of angry, threatening voices.“It’s not by our choice, Richard... We have our own families to think about...Wives and Children.”Wanting to know what was going on, Kahlan tried to push herself up onto her leftelbow. Somehow, her arm didn’t work the way she had expected it to. Like a boltof lightning, pain blasted up the marrow of her bone and exploded through hershoulder.Gasping against the racking agony of attempted movement, she dropped back beforeshe had managed to lift her shoulder an inch off the bed. Her panting twistedthe daggers piercing her sides. She had to will herself to slow her breathing inorder to get the stabbing pain under control. As the worst of the torment in herarm and the stitches in her ribs eased, she finally let out a soft moan.With calculated calm, she gazed down the length of her left arm. The arm wasspitted. As soon as she saw it, she remembered that of course it was. Shereproached herself for not thinking of it before she had tried to put weight onit. The herbs, she knew, were making her thinking fuzzy. Fearing to make anothercareless movement, and since she couldn’t sit up, she focused her effort onforcing clarity into her mind.She cautiously reached up with her right hand and wiped her fingers across thebloom of sweat on her brow, sweat sown by the flash of pain. Her right shouldersocket hurt, but it worked well enough. She was pleased by that triumph, atleast. She touched her puffy eyes, understanding then why it had hurt to looktoward the door. Gingerly, her fingers explored a foreign landscape of swollenflesh. Her imagination colored it a ghastly black-and-blue. When her fingersbrushed cuts on her cheek, hot embers seemed to sear raw, exposed nerves.She needed no mirror to know she was a terrible sight. She knew, too, how bad itwas whenever she looked up into Richard’s eyes. She wished she could look goodfor him if for no other reason than to lift the suffering from his eyes. Readingher thoughts, he would say, “I’m fine. Stop worrying about me and put your mindto getting better.”With a bittersweet longing, Kahlan recalled lying with Richard, their limbstangled in delicious exhaustion, his skin hot against hers, his big hand restingon her belly as they caught their breath. It was agony wanting to hold him inher arms again and being unable to do so. She reminded herself that it was onlya matter of some time and some healing. They were together and that was whatmattered. His mere presence was a restorative.She heard Richard, beyond the blanket over the door, speaking in a tightlycontrolled voice, stressing his words as if each had cost him a fortune. “Wejust need some time . . .”The men’s voices were heated and insistent as they all began talking at once.“It’s not because we want you to, you should know that, Richard, you know us.... What if it brings trouble here? . . . We’ve heard about the fighting. Yousaid yourself she’s from theMidlands. We can’t allow . . . we won’t . . .”Kahlan listened, expecting the sound of his sword being drawn. Richard hadnearly infinite patience, but little tolerance. Cara, his bodyguard, theirfriend, was no doubt out there, too; Cara had neither patience nor tolerance.Instead of drawing his sword, Richard said, “I’m not asking anyone to give Meanything I want only to be left alone in a peaceful place where I can care forher. I wanted to be close to Hartland in case she needed something.” He paused.“Please . . . just until she has a chance to get better.”Kahlan wanted to scream at him: No! Don’t you dare beg them, Richard! They haveno right to make you beg. They’ve no right! They could never understand thesacrifices you’ve made.But she could do little more than whisper his name in sorrow.“Don’t test us .... We’ll burn you out if we have to! You can’t fight us all-wehave right on our side.”The men ranted and swore dark oaths. She expected, now, at last, to hear thesound of his sword being drawn. Instead, in a calm voice, Richard answered themen in words Kahlan couldn’t quite make out. A dreadful quiet settled in.“It’s not because we like doing this, Richard,” someone finally said in asheepish voice. “We’ve no choice. We’ve got to consider our own families andeveryone else.”Another man spoke out with righteous indignation. “Besides, you seem to havegotten all high-and-mighty of a sudden, with your fancy clothes and sword, notlike you used to be, back when you were a woods guide.”“That’s right,” said another. “Just because you went off and saw some of theworld, that don’t mean you can come back here thinking you’re better than us.”“I’ve overstepped what you have all decided is my proper place,” Richard said.“Is this what you mean to say?”“You turned your back on your community, on your roots, as I see it; you thinkour women aren’t good enough for the great Richard Cypher. No, he had to marrysome woman from away. Then you come back here and think to flaunt yourselvesover us.”“How? By doing what? Marrying the woman I love? This, you see as vain? Thisnullifies my right to live in peace? And takes away her right to heal, to getwell and live?”These men knew him as Richard Cypher, a simple woods guide, not as the person hehad discovered he was in truth, and who he had become. He was the same man asbefore, but in so many ways, they had never known him.“You ought to be on your knees praying for the Creator to heal your wife,”another man put in. “All of mankind is a wretched and undeserving lot. You oughtto pray and ask the Creator’s forgiveness for your evil deeds andsinfulness-that’s what brought your troubles on you and your woman. Instead, youwant to bring your troubles among honest working folks. You’ve no right to tryto force your sinful troubles on us. That’s not what the Creator wants. Youshould be thinking of us. The Creator wants you to be humble and to helpothers-that’s why He struck her down: to teach you both a lesson.”“Did he tell you this, Albert?” Richard asked. “Does this Creator of yours cometo talk with you about his intentions and confide in you his wishes?”“He talks to anyone who has the proper modest attitude to listen to Him,” Albertfumed.“Besides,” another man spoke up, “this Imperial Order you warn about has somegood things to be said for it. If you weren’t so bullheaded, Richard, you’d seethat. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to see everyone treated decent. It’sonly being fair minded. It’s only right. Those are the Creator’s wishes, you’vegot to admit, and that’s what the Imperial Order teaches, too. If you can’t seethat much good in the Order-well then, you’d best be gone, and soon.”Kahlan held her breath.In an ominous tone of voice, Richard said, “So be it.”These were men Richard knew; he had addressed them by name and reminded them ofyears and deeds shared. He had been patient with them. Patience finallyexhausted, he had reached intolerance.Horses snorted and stomped, their leather tack creaking, as the men mounted up.“In the morning we’ll be back to burn this place down. We’d better not catch youor yours anywhere near here, or you’ll burn with it.” After a few last curses,the men raced away. The sound of departing hooves hammering the ground rumbledthrough Kahlan’s back. Even that hurt.She smiled a small smile for Richard, even if he couldn’t see it. She wishedonly that he had not begged on her behalf; he would never, she knew, have beggedfor anything for himself.Light splashed across the wall as the blanket over the doorway was thrown back.By the direction and quality of the light, Kahlan guessed it had to be somewherein the middle of a thinly overcast day. Richard appeared beside her, his tallform towering over her, throwing a slash of shadow across her middle.He wore a black, sleeveless undershirt, without his shirt or magnificent goldand black tunic, leaving his muscular arms bare. At his left hip, the sidetoward her, a flash of light glinted off the pommel of his singular sword. Hisbroad shoulders made the room seem even smaller than it had been only a momentbefore. His cleanshaven face, his strong jaw, and the crisp line of his mouthperfectly complemented his powerful form. His hair, a color somewhere betweenblond and brown, brushed the nape of his neck. But it was the intelligence soclearly evident in those penetrating gray eyes of his that from the first hadriveted her attention.“Richard,” Kahlan whispered, “I won’t have you begging on my account.”The corners of his mouth tightened with the hint of a smile. “If I want to beg,I shall do so.” He pulled her blanket up a little, making sure she was snuglycovered, even though she was sweating. “I didn’t know you were awake.”“How long have I been asleep?”“A while.”She figured it must have been quite a while. She didn’t remember arriving atthis place, or him building the house that now stood around her.Kahlan felt more like a person in her eighties than one in her twenties. She hadnever been hurt before, not grievously hurt, anyway, not to the point of beingon the cusp of death and utterly helpless for so long. She hated it, and shehated that she couldn’t do the simplest things for herself. Most of the time shedetested that more than the pain.She was stunned to understand so unexpectedly and so completely life’s frailty,her own frailty, her own mortality. She had risked her life in the past and hadbeen in danger many times, but looking back she didn’t know if she had evertruly believed that something like this could happen to her. Confronting thereality of it was crushing.Something inside seemed to have broken that night-some idea of herself, someconfidence. She could so easily have died. Their baby could have died before iteven had a chance to live.“You’re getting better,” Richard said, as if in answer to her thoughts. “I’m notjust saying that. I can see that you’re healing.”She gazed into his eyes, summoning the courage to finally ask, “How do they knowabout the Order way up here?”“People fleeing the fighting have been up this way. Men spreading the doctrineof the Imperial Order have been even here, to where I grew up. Their words cansound good-almost make sense-if you don’t think, if you just feel. Truth doesn’tseem to count for much,” He added in afterthought. He answered the unspokenquestion in her eyes. “The men from the Order are gone. The fools out there werejust spouting things they’ve heard, that’s all.”“But they intend us to leave. They sound like men who keep the oaths they’vesworn.”He nodded, but then some of his smile returned. “Do you know that we’re veryclose to where I first met you, last autumn? Do you remember?”“How could I ever forget the day I met you?”“Our lives were in jeopardy back then and we had to leave here. I’ve neverregretted it. It was the start of my life with you. As long as we’re together,nothing else really matters.”Cara swept in through the doorway and came to a halt beside Richard, adding hershadow to his across the blue cotton blanket that covered Kahlan to her armpits.Sheathed in skintight red leather, Cara’s body had the sleek grace of a falcon:commanding, swift, and deadly. Mord-Sith always wore their red leather when theybelieved there was going to be trouble. Cara’s long blond hair, swept back intoa single thick braid, was another mark of her profession of Mord-Sith, member ofan elite corps of guards to the Lord Rahl himself.Richard had, after a fashion, inherited the Mord-Sith when he inherited the ruleof D’Hara, a place he grew up never knowing. Command was not something he hadsought; nonetheless it had fallen to him. Now a great many people depended onhim. The entire New World-Westland, the Midlands, and D’Hara depended on him.“How do you feel?” Cara asked with sincere concern.Kahlan was able to summon little more voice than a hoarse whisper. “I’m better.”“Well, if you feel better,” Cara growled, “then tell Lord Rahl that he shouldallow me to do my job and put the proper respect into men like that.” Hermenacing blue eyes turned for a moment toward the spot where the men had beenwhile delivering their threats. “The ones I leave alive, anyway.”“Cara, use your head,” Richard said. “We can’t turn this place into a fortressand protect ourselves every hour of every day. Those men are afraid. No matterhow wrong they are, they view us as a danger to their lives and the lives oftheir families. We know better than to fight a senseless battle when we canavoid it.”“But Richard,” Kahlan said, lifting her right hand in a weak gesture toward thewall before her, “you’ve built this-”“Only this room. I wanted a shelter for you first. It didn’t take that long justsome trees cut and split. We’ve not built the rest of it yet. It’s not worthshedding blood over.”If Richard seemed calm, Cara looked ready to chew steel and spit nails. “Wouldyou tell this obstinate husband of yours to let me kill someone before I gocrazy? I can’t just stand around and allow people to get away with threateningthe two of you! I am Mord-Sith!”Cara took her job of protecting Richard-the Lord Rahl of D’Hara-and Kahlan veryseriously. Where Richard’s life was concerned, Cara was perfectly willing tokill first and decide later if it had been necessary. That was one of the thingsfor which Richard had no tolerance.Kahlan’s only answer was a smile.“Mother Confessor, you can’t allow Lord Rahl to bow to the will of foolish menlike those. Tell him.”Kahlan could probably count on the fingers of one hand the people who, in herwhole life, had ever addressed her by the name “Kahlan” without at minimum theappellation “Confessor” before it. She had heard her ultimate title-MotherConfessor-spoken countless times, in tones ranging from awed reverence toshuddering fear. Many people, as they knelt before her, were incapable of evenwhispering through trembling lips the two words of her title. Others, whenalone, whispered them with lethal intent.Kahlan had been named Mother Confessor while still in her early twenties-theyoungest Confessor ever named to that powerful position. But that was severalyears past. Now, she was the only living Confessor left.Kahlan had always endured the title, the bowing and kneeling, the reverence, theawe, the fear, and the murderous intentions, because she had no choice. But morethan that, she was the Mother Confessor-by succession and selection, by right,by oath, and by duty.Cara always addressed Kahlan as “Mother Confessor.” But from Cara’s lips thewords were subtly different than from any others. It was almost a challenge, adefiance by scrupulous compliance, but with a hint of an affectionate smirk.Coming from Cara, Kahlan didn’t hear “Mother Confessor” so much as she heard“Sister.” Cara was from the distant land of D’Hara. No one, anywhere, outrankedCara, as far as Cara was concerned, except the Lord Rahl. The most she wouldallow was that Kahlan could be her equal in duty to Richard. Being considered anequal by Cara, though, was high praise indeed.When Cara addressed Richard as Lord Rahl, however, she was not saying “Brother.”She was saying precisely what she meant: Lord Rahl.To the men with the angry voices, the Lord Rahl was as foreign a concept as wasthe distant land of D’Hara. Kahlan was from the Midlands that separated D’Harafrom Westland. The people here in Westland knew nothing of the Midlands or theMother Confessor. For decades, the three parts of the New World had beenseparated by impassable boundaries, leaving what was beyond those boundariesshrouded in mystery. The autumn before, those boundaries had fallen.And then, in the winter, the common barrier to the south of the three lands thathad for three thousand years sealed away the menace of the Old World had beenbreached, loosing the Imperial Order on them all. In the last year, the worldhad been thrown into turmoil; everything everyone had grown up knowing hadchanged.“I’m not going to allow you to hurt people just because they refuse to help us,”Richard said to Cara. “It would solve nothing and only end up causing us moretrouble. What we started here only took a short time to build. I thought thisplace would be safe, but it’s not. We’ll simply move on.”He turned back to Kahlan. His voice lost its fire.“I was hoping to bring you home, to some peace and quiet, but it looks like homedoesn’t want me, either. I’m sorry.”“Just those men, Richard.” In the land of Anderith, just before Kahlan had beenattacked and beaten, the people had rejected Richard’s offer to join theemerging D’Haran Empire he led in the cause of freedom. Instead, the people ofAnderith willingly chose to side with the Imperial Order. Richard had takenKahlan and walked away from everything, it seemed. “What about your real friendshere?”“I haven’t had time . . . I wanted to get a shelter up, first. There’s no timenow. Maybe later.”Kahlan reached for his hand, which hung at his side. His fingers were too faraway. “But, Richard-”“Look, it’s not safe to stay here anymore. It’s as simple as that. I brought youhere because I thought it would be a safe place for you to recover and regainyour strength. I was wrong. It’s not. We can’t stay here. Understand?”“Yes, Richard.”“We have to move on.”“Yes, Richard.”There was something more to this, she knew-something of far greater importancethan the more immediate ordeal it meant for her. There was a distant, troubledlook in his eyes.“But what of the war? Everyone is depending on us-on you. I can’t be much helpuntil I get better, but they need you right now. The D’Haran Empire needs you.You are the Lord Rahl. You lead them. What are we doing here? Richard. . .” Shewaited until his eyes turned to look at her. “Why are we running away wheneveryone is counting on us?”“I’m doing as I must.”“As you must? What does that mean?”Shadow shrouded his face as he looked away.“I’ve . . . had a vision.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2“A vision?” Kahlan said in open astonishment.Richard hated anything to do with prophecy. It had caused him no end of trouble.Prophecy was always ambiguous and usually cryptic, no matter how clear it seemedon the surface. The untrained were easily misled by its superficially simplisticconstruction. Unthinking adherence to a literal interpretation of prophecy hadin the past caused great turmoil, everything from murder to war. As a result,those involved with prophecy went to great lengths to keep it secret.Prophecy, at least on the face of it, was predestination; Richard believed thatman created his own destiny. He had once told her, “Prophecy can only say thattomorrow the sun will come up. It can’t say what you are going to do with yourday. The act of going about your day is not the fulfillment of prophecy, but thefulfillment of your own purpose.”Shota, the witch woman, had prophesied that Richard and Kahlan would conceive aninfamous son. Richard had more than once proven Shota’s view of the future tobe, if not fatally flawed, at least vastly more complex than Shota would have itseem. Like Richard, Kahlan didn’t accept Shota’s prediction.On any number of occasions, Richard’s view of prophecy had been shown to becorrect. Richard simply ignored what prophecy said and did as he believed hemust. By his doing so, prophecy was in the end often fulfilled, but in ways thatcould not have been foretold. In this way, prophecy was at once proven anddisproved, resolving nothing and only demonstrating what an eternal enigma ittruly was.Richard’s grandfather, Zedd, who had helped raise him not far from where theywere, had not only kept his own identity as a wizard secret. In order to protectRichard, he also hid the fact that Richard had been fathered by Darken Rahl andnot George Cypher, the man who had loved and raised him. Darken Rahl, a wizardof great power, had been the dangerous, violent ruler of far-off D’Hara. Richardhad inherited the gift of magic from two different bloodlines. After killingDarken Rahl, he had also inherited the rule of D’Hara, a land that was in manyways as much a mystery to him as was his power.Kahlan, being from the Midlands, had grown up around wizards; Richard’s abilitywas unlike that of any wizard she had ever known. He possessed not one aspect ofthe gift, but many, and not one side, but both: he was a war wizard. Some of hisoutfit came from the Wizard’s Keep, and had not been worn in three thousandyears-since the last war wizard lived.With the gift dying out in mankind, wizards were uncommon; Kahlan had knownfewer than a dozen. Among wizards, prophets were the most rare; she knew of theexistence of only two. One of those was the more within the province ofRichard’s gift. Yet Richard had always treated prophecy as a viper in his bed.Tenderly, as if there were no more precious thing in the whole world, Richardlifted her hand. “You know how I always talk about the beautiful places only Iknow way back in the mountains to the west of where I grew up? The specialplaces I’ve always wanted to show you? I’m going to take you there, where we’llbe safe.”“D’Harans are bonded to you, Lord Rahl,” Cara reminded him, “and will be able tofind you through that bond.”“Well, our enemies aren’t bonded to me. They won’t know where we are.”Cara seemed to find that thought agreeable. “If people don’t go to this place,then there won’t be any roads. How are we going to get the carriage there? TheMother Confessor can’t walk.”“I’ll make a litter. You and I will carry her in that.”Cara nodded thoughtfully. “We could do that. If there were no other people, thenthe two of you would be safe, at least.”“Safer than here. I had expected the people here to leave us to ourselves. Ihadn’t expected the Order to foment unrest this far away-at least not thisquickly. Those men usually aren’t a bad lot, but they’re working themselves upinto a dangerous mood. ““The cowards have gone back to their women’s skirts. They won’t be back untilmorning. We can let the Mother Confessor rest and then leave before dawn.”Richard cast Cara a telling look. “One of those men, Albert, has a son, Lester.Lester and his pal, Tommy Lancaster, once tried to put arrows into me forspoiling some fun Tommy was about to have hurting someone. Now Tommy and Lesterare missing a good many teeth. Albert will tell Lester about us being here, andsoon after, Tommy Lancaster will know, too.“Now that the Imperial Order has filled their heads with talk of a noble war onbehalf of good, those men will be fancying what it would be like to be warheroes. They aren’t ordinarily violent, but today they were more unreasonablethan I’ve ever seen them.“They’ll go drinking to fortify their courage. Tommy and Lester will be withthem by then, and their tales of how I wronged them and how I’m a danger todecent folks will get everyone all worked up. Because they greatly outnumber us,they’ll begin to see the merit in killing us-see it as protecting their familiesand doing the right thing for the community and their Creator. Full of liquorand glory, they won’t want to wait until morning. They’ll be back tonight. Wehave to leave now.”Cara seemed unconcerned. “I say we wait for them, and when they come back, weend the threat.”“Some of them will bring along other friends. There will be a lot of them by thetime they get here. We have Kahlan to think about. I don’t want to risk one ofus being injured. There’s nothing to be gained by fighting them.”Richard pulled the ancient, tooled-leather baldric, holding thegold-and-silverwrought scabbard and sword, off over his head and hung it on thestump of a branch sticking out of a log. Looking unhappy, Cara folded her arms.She would rather not leave a threat alive. Richard picked his folded black shirtoff the floor to the side, where Kahlan hadn’t seen it. He poked an arm througha sleeve and drew it on.“A vision?” Kahlan finally asked again. As much trouble as the men could be,they were not her biggest concern just then. “You’ve had a vision?”“The sudden clarity of it felt like a vision, but it was really more of arevelation.”“Revelation.” She wished she could manage more than a hoarse whisper. “And whatform did this vision revelation thing take?”“Understanding.”Kahlan stared up at him. “Understanding of what?”He started buttoning his shirt. “Through this realization I’ve come tounderstand the larger picture. I’ve come to understand what it is I must do.”“Yes,” Cara muttered, “and wait until you hear it. Go ahead, tell her.”Richard glared at Cara and she answered him in kind. His attention finallyreturned to Kahlan.“If I lead us into this war, we will lose. A great many people will die fornothing. The result will be a world enslaved by the Imperial Order. If I don’tlead our side in battle, the world will still fall under the shadow of the Orderbut far fewer people will die. Only in that way will we ever stand a chance.”“By losing? You want to lose first, and then fight? . . . How can we evenconsider abandoning the fight for freedom?”“Anderith helped teach me a lesson,” he said. His voice was restrained, as if heregretted what he was saying. “I can’t press this war. Freedom requires effortif it is to be won and vigilance if it is to be maintained. People just don’tvalue freedom until it’s taken away.”“But many do,” Kahlan objected.“There are always some, but most don’t even understand it, nor do they careto-the same as with magic. People mindlessly shrink from it, too, without seeingthe truth. The Order offers them a world without magic and ready-made answers toeverything. Servitude is simple. I thought that I could convince people of thevalue of their own lives, and of liberty. In Anderith they showed me just howfoolish I had been.”“Anderith is just one place-”“Anderith was not remarkable. Look at all the trouble we’ve had elsewhere. We’rehaving trouble even here, where I grew up.” Richard began tucking in his shirt.“Forcing people to fight for freedom is the worst kind of contradiction.“Nothing I can say will inspire people to care-I’ve tried. Those who valueliberty will have to run, to hide, to try to survive and endure what is sure tocome. I can’t prevent it. I can’t help them. I know that now.”“But Richard, how can you even think of-”‘I must do what is best for us. I must be selfish; life is far too precious tobe casually squandered on useless causes. There can be no greater evil thanthat. People can only be saved from the coming dark age of subjugation andservitude if they, too, come to understand and care about the value of their ownlives, their freedom, and are willing to act in their own interest. We must tryto stay alive in the hope that such a day will come.”“But we can prevail in this war. We must.”“Do you think that I can just go off and lead men into war, and because I wishit, we will win? We won’t. It takes more than my wishing it. It will take vastnumbers of people fully committed to the cause. We don’t have that. If we throwour forces against the Order, we will be destroyed and any chance for winningfreedom in the future will be forever lost.” He raked his fingers back throughhis hair. “We must not lead our forces against the army of the Order.”He turned to pulling his black, open-sided tunic on over his head. Kahlanstruggled to give force to her voice, to the magnitude of her concern.“But what about all those who are prepared to fight-all the armies already inthe field? There are good men, able men, ready to go against Jagang and stop hisImperial Order and drive them back to the Old World. Who will lead our men?”“Lead them to what? Death? They can’t win.”Kahlan was horrified. She reached up and snatched his shirtsleeve before hecould lean down to retrieve his broad over-belt. “Richard, you’re only sayingthis, walking away from the struggle, because of what happened to me.”“No. I had already decided it that same night, before you were attacked. When Iwent out alone for a walk, after the vote, I did a lot of thinking. I came tothis realization and made up my mind. What happened to you made no differenceexcept to prove the point that I’m right and should have figured it out sooner.If I had, you would never have been hurt.”“But if the Mother Confessor had not been hurt, you would have felt better bymorning and changed your mind.”Light coming through the doorway behind him lit in a blaze of gold the ancientsymbols coiled along the squared edges of his tunic. “Cara, what would happen ifI’d been attacked with her, and we had both been killed? What would you all dothen?”“I don’t know.”“That is why I withdraw. You are all following me, not participating in astruggle for your own future. Your answer should have been that you would allfight on for yourselves, for your freedom. I have come to understand the mistakeI’ve made in this, and to see that we cannot win in this way. The Order is toolarge an opponent.”Kahlan’s father, King Wyborn, had taught her about fighting against such odds,and she had practical experience at it. “Their army may outnumber ours, but thatdoesn’t make it impossible. We just have to outthink them. I will be there tohelp you, Richard. We have seasoned officers. We can do it. We must.”“Look how the Order’s cause spreads on words that sound good”-Richard swept outan arm-”even to distant places like this. We know beyond doubt the evil of theOrder, yet people everywhere passionately side with them despite the ghastlytruth of everything the Imperial Order stands for.”“Richard,” Kahlan whispered, trying not to lose what was left of her voice, “Iled those young Galean recruits against an army of experienced Order soldierswho greatly outnumbered us, and we prevailed.”“Exactly. They had just seen their home city after the Order had been there.Everyone they loved had been murdered, everything they knew had been destroyed.Those men fought with an understanding of what they were doing and why. Theywere going to throw themselves at the enemy with or without you commanding them.But they were the only ones, and even though they succeeded, most of them werekilled in the struggle.”Kahlan was incredulous. “So you are going to let the Order do the same elsewhereso as to give people a reason to fight? You are going to stand aside and let theOrder slaughter hundreds of thousands of innocent people?“You want to quit because I was hurt. Dear spirits, I love you Richard, butdon’t do this to me. I’m the Mother Confessor; I’m responsible for the lives ofthe people of the Midlands. Don’t do this because of what happened to me.”Richard snapped on his leather-padded silver wristbands. “I’m not doing thisbecause of what happened to you. I’m helping save those lives in the only waythat has a chance. I’m doing the only thing I can do.”“You are doing the easy thing,” Cara said.Richard met her challenge with quiet sincerity. “Cara, I’m doing the hardestthing I have ever had to do.”Kahlan was sure now that their rejection by the Anderith people had hit himharder than she had realized. She caught two of his fingers and squeezedsympathetically. He had put his heart into sparing those people from enslavementby the Order. He had tried to show them the value of freedom by allowing themthe freedom to choose their own destiny. He had put his faith in their hands.In a crushing defeat, an enormous majority had spurned all he had offered, andin so doing devastated that faith.Kahlan thought that perhaps with some time to heal, the same as with her, thepain would fade for him, too. “You can’t hold yourself to blame for the fall ofAnderith, Richard. You did your best. It wasn’t your fault.”He picked up his big leather over-belt with its gold-worked pouches and cinchedit over the magnificent tunic.“When you’re the leader, everything is your fault.”Kahlan knew the truth of that. She thought to dissuade him by taking a differenttack.“What form did this vision assume?”Richard’s piercing gray eyes locked on her, almost in warning.“Vision, revelation, realization, postulation, prophecy . . .understanding--call it what you will, for in this they are all in one the same,and unequivocal. I can’t describe it but to say it seems as if I must havealways known it. Maybe I have. It wasn’t so much words as it was a completeconcept, a conclusion, a truth that became absolutely clear to me.”She knew he expected her to leave it at that. “If it became so clear and isunambiguous,” she pressed, “you must be able to express it in words.”Richard slipped the baldric over his head, laying it over his right shoulder. Ashe adjusted the sword against his left hip, light sparkled off the raised goldwire woven through the silver wire of the hilt to spell out the word TRUTH.His brow was smooth and his face calm. She knew she had at last brought him tothe heart of the matter. His certainty would afford him no reason to keep itfrom her if she chose to hear it, and she did. His words rolled forth with quietpower, like prophecy come to life.“I have been a leader too soon. It is not I who must prove myself to the people,but the people who must now prove themselves to me. Until then, I must not leadthem, or all hope is lost.”Standing there, erect, masculine, masterful in his black war wizard outfit, helooked as if he could be posing for a statue of who he was: the Seeker of Truth,rightfully named by Zeddicus Zu’Zorander, the First Wizard himself-and Richard’sgrandfather. It had nearly broken Zedd’s heart to do so, because Seekers sooften died young and violently.While he lived, a Seeker was a law unto himself. Backed by the awesome power ofhis sword, a Seeker could bring down kingdoms. That was one reason it was soimportant to name the right person-a moral person-to the post. Zedd claimed thatthe Seeker, in a way, named himself by the nature of his own mind and by hisactions, and that the First Wizard’s function was simply to act on hisobservations by officially naming him and giving him the weapon that was to behis lifelong companion.So many different qualities and responsibilities had converged in this man sheloved that she sometimes wondered how he could reconcile them all.“Richard, are you so sure?”Because of the importance of the past, Kahlan and then Zedd had sworn theirlives in defense of Richard as the newly named Seeker of Truth. That had beenshortly after Kahlan had met him. It was as Seeker that Richard had first cometo accept all that had been thrust upon him, and to live up to the extraordinarytrust put in him.His gray eyes fairly blazed with clarity of purpose as he answered her.“The only sovereign I can allow to rule me is reason. The first law of reason isthis: what exists, exists; what is, is. From this irreducible, bedrockprinciple, all knowledge is built. This is the foundation from which life isembraced.“Reason is a choice. Wishes and whims are not facts, nor are they a means todiscovering them. Reason is our only way of grasping reality-it’s our basic toolof survival. We are free to evade the effort of thinking, to reject reason, butwe are not free to avoid the penalty of the abyss we refuse to see.“If I fail to use reason in this struggle, if I close my eyes to the reality ofwhat is, in favor of what I would wish, then we will both die in this, and fornothing. We will be but two more among uncounted millions of nameless corpsesbeneath the gray, gloomy decay of mankind. In the darkness that will follow, ourbones will be meaningless dust.“Eventually, perhaps a thousand years from now, perhaps more, the light ofliberty will again be raised up to shine over a free people, but between now andthen, millions upon millions of people will be born into hopeless misery andhave no choice but to bear the weight of the Order’s yoke. We, by ignoringreason, will have purchased those mountains of broken bodies, the wreckage oflives endured but never lived.”Kahlan found herself unable to summon the courage to speak, much less argue; todo so right then would be to ask him to disregard his judgment at a cost hebelieved would be a sea of blood. But doing as he saw they must would cast herpeople helpless into the jaws of death.Kahlan, her vision turning to a watery blur, looked away.“Cara,” Richard said, “get the horses hitched to the carrage. I’m going to scouta circle to make sure we don’t have any surprises.”“I will scout while you hitch the horses. I am your guard.”“You’re my friend, too. I know this land better than you. Hitch the horses anddon’t give me any trouble about it.”Cara rolled her eyes and huffed, but marched off to do his bidding.The room rang with silence. Richard’s shadow slipped off the blanket. WhenKahlan whispered her love to him, he paused and looked back. His shouldersseemed to betray the weight he carried.“I wish I could, but I can’t make people understand freedom. I’m sorry.”From somewhere inside, Kahlan found a smile for him. “Maybe it isn’t so hard.”She gestured toward the bird he had carved in the wall. “Just show them that,and they will understand what freedom really means: to soar on your own wings.”Richard smiled, she thought gratefully, before he vanished through the doorway."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3All the troubling thoughts tumbling through her mind kept Kahlan from fallingback to sleep. She tried not to think about Richard’s vision of the future. Asexhausted as she was by pain, his words were too troubling to contemplate, andbesides, there was nothing she could do about it right then. But she wasdetermined to help him get over the loss of Anderith and focus on stopping theImperial Order.It was more difficult to shake her thoughts about the men who had been outside,men Richard had grown up with. The haunting memory of their angry threats echoedin her mind. She knew that ordinary men who had never before acted violently,could, in the right circumstances, be incited to great brutality. With the waythey viewed mankind as sinful, wretched, and evil, it was only a small step moreto actually doing evil. After all, any evil they might do, they had alreadyrationalized as being predestined by what they viewed as man’s inescapablenature.It was unnerving to contemplate an attack by such men when she could do nothingbut lie there waiting to be killed. Kahlan envisioned a grinning, toothlessTommy Lancaster leaning over her to cut her throat while all she could do wasstare helplessly up at him. She had often been afraid in battle, but at leastthen she could fight with all her strength to survive. That helped counter thefear. It was different to be helpless and have no means to fight back; it was adifferent sort of fear.If she had to, she could always resort to her Confessor’s power, but in hercondition that was a dubious proposition. She had never had to call upon herpower when in anything like the condition in which she now found herself. Shereminded herself that the three of them would be long gone before the menreturned, and besides, Richard and Cara would never let them get near her.Kahlan had a more immediate fear, though, and that one was all too real. But shewouldn’t feel it for long; she would pass out, she knew. She hoped.She tried not to think of it, and instead put her hand gently over her belly,over their child, as she listened to the nearby splashing and burbling of astream. The sound of the water reminded her of how much she wished she couldtake a bath. The bandages over the oozing wound in her side stank and needed tobe changed often. The sheets were soaked with sweat. Her scalp itched. The matof grass that was the bedding under the sheet was hard and chafed her back.Richard had probably made the pallet quickly, planning to improve it later.As hot as the day was, the stream’s cold water would be welcome. She longed fora bath, to be clean, and to smell fresh. She longed to be better, to be able todo things for herself, to be healed. She could only hope that as time passed,Richard, too, would recover from his invisible, but real, wounds.Cara finally returned, grumbling about the horses being stubborn today. Shelooked up to see the room was empty. “I had better go look for him and makesure: he’s safe.”“He’s fine. He knows what he’s doing. Just wait, Cara, or he will then have togo out and look for you.”Cara sighed and reluctantly agreed. Retrieving a cool, wet cloth, she set tomopping Kahlan’s forehead and temples. Kahlan didn’t like to complain whenpeople; were doing their best to care for her, so she didn’t say anything abouthow much it hurt her torn neck muscles when her head was shifted in that way.Cara never complained about any of it. Cara only complained when she believedher charges were in needless danger-and when Richard wouldn’t let her eliminatethose she viewed as a danger.Outside, a bird let out a high-pitched trill. The tedious repetition wasbecoming, grating. In the distance, Kahlan could hear a squirrel chattering anobjection to something, or perhaps arguing over his territory. He’d been doingit for what seemed’ an hour. The stream babbled on without letup.This was Richard’s idea of restful.“I hate this,” she muttered.“You should be happy-lying about without anything to do.”“And I bet you would be happy to trade places?”“I am Mord-Sith. For a Mord-Sith, nothing could be worse than to die in bed.”Her blue eyes turned to Kahlan’s. “Old and toothless,” she added. “I didn’tmean; that you-”“I know what you meant.”Cara looked relieved. “Anyway, you couldn’t die-that would be too easy. Younever do anything easy.”“I married Richard.”“See what I mean?”Kahlan smiled.Cara dunked the cloth in a pail on the floor and wrung it out as she stood. “It`isn’t too bad, is it? Just lying there?”“How would you like to have to have someone push a wooden bowl under your bottomevery time your bladder was full?”Cara carefully blotted the damp cloth along Kahlan’s neck. “I don’t mind doingit for a sister of the Agiel.”The Agiel, the weapon a Mord-Sith always carried, looked like nothing more; thana short, red leather rod hanging on a fine chain from her right wrist. A Mord~.Sith’s Agiel was never more than a flick away from her grip. It somehowfunctioned: by means of the magic of a Mord-Sith’s bond to the Lord Rahl.Kahlan had once felt the partial touch of an Agiel. In a blinding instant, itcould inflict the kind of pain that the entire gang of men had dealt Kahlan. Thetouch of a, Mord-Sith’s Agiel was easily capable of delivering bone-breakingtorture, and just as easily, if she desired, death.Richard had given Kahlan the Agiel that had belonged to Denna, the Mord-Sith whohad captured him by order of Darken Rahl. Only Richard had ever come tounderstand and empathize with the pain an Agiel also gave the Mord-Sith whowielded it. Before he was forced to kill Denna in order to escape, she had givenhim her Agiel, asking to be remembered as simply Denna, the woman beyondtheappellation of Mord-Sith, the woman no one but Richard had ever before seenand understood.That Kahlan understood, and kept the Agiel as a symbol of that same respect forwomen whose young lives had been stolen and twisted to nightmare purposes andduties, was deeply meaningful to the other Mord-Sith. Because of thatcompassion-untainted by pity-and more, Cara had named Kahlan a sister of theAgiel. It was an informal but heartfelt accolade.“Messengers have come to see Lord Rahl,” Cara said. “You were sleeping, and LordRahl saw no reason to wake you,” she added in answer to Kahlan’s questioninglook. The messengers were D’Haran, and able to find Richard by their bond to himas their Lord Rahl. Kahlan, not able to duplicate the feat, had always found itunsettling.“What did they have to say?”Cara shrugged. “Not a lot. Jagang’s army of the Imperial Order remains inAnderith for the time being, with Reibisch’s force staying safely to the northto watch and be ready should the Order decide to threaten the rest of theMidlands. We know little of the situation inside Anderith, under the Order’soccupation. The rivers flow away from our men, toward the sea, so they have notseen bodies to indicate if there has been mass death, but there have been a fewpeople who managed to escape. They report that there was some death due to thepoison which was released, but they don’t know how widespread it was. GeneralReibisch has sent scouts and spies in to learn what they will.”“What orders did Richard give them to take back?”“None.”“None? He sent no orders?”Cara shook her head and then leaned over to dunk the cloth again. “He wroteletters to the general, though.”She drew the blanket down, lifted the bandage at Kahlan’s side, and inspectedits weak red charge before tossing it on the floor. With a gentle touch, shecleaned the wound.When Kahlan was able to get her breath, she asked, “Did you see the letters?”“Yes. They say much the same as he has told you-that he has had a vision thathas caused him to come to see the nature of what he must do. He explained to thegeneral that he could not give orders for fear of causing the end of ourchances.”“Did General Reibisch answer?”“Lord Rahl has had a vision. D’Harans know the Lord Rahl must deal with theterrifying mysteries of magic. D’Harans do not expect to understand their LordRahl and would not question his behavior: he is the Lord Rahl. The general madeno comment, but sent word that he would use his own judgment.”Richard had probably told them it was a vision, rather than say it was simply arealization, for that very reason. Kahlan considered that a moment, weighing thepossibilities.“We have that much luck, then. General Reibisch is a good man, and will knowwhat to do. Before too long, I’ll be up and about. By then, maybe Richard willbe better, too.”Cara tossed the cloth into the pail. As she leaned closer, her brow creased withfrustration and concern.“Mother Confessor, Lord Rahl said he will not act to lead us until the peopleprove themselves to him.”“I’m getting better. I hope to help him get over what happened and help him tosee that he must fight.”“But this involves magic.” She picked at the frayed edge of the blue blanket.“Lord Rahl said it’s a vision. If it is magic, then it’s something he would knowabout and must handle in the way he sees it must be done.”“We need to be a little understanding of what he’s been through-the loss we’veall suffered to the Order-and remember, too, that Richard didn’t grow up aroundmagic, much less ruling armies.”Cara squatted and rinsed her cloth in the pail. After wringing it out, she wentback to cleaning the wound in Kahlan’s side. “He is the Lord Rahl, though.Hasn’t he already proven himself to be a master of magic a number of times?”Kahlan couldn’t dispute that much of it, but he still didn’t have muchexperience, and experience was valuable. Cara not only feared magic but waseasily impressed by any act of wizardry. Like most people, she couldn’tdistinguish between a simple conjuring and the kind of magic that could alterthe very nature of the world. Kahlan realized now that this wasn’t a vision, assuch, but a conclusion Richard had arrived at.Much of what he’d said made sense, but Kahlan believed that emotion was cloudinghis thinking.Cara looked up from her work. Her voice bore an undertone of uncertainty, if notdespairing bewilderment. “Mother Confessor, how will the people ever be able toprove themselves to Lord Rahl?”“I’ve no idea.”Cara set down the cloth and looked Kahlan in the eye. It was a long,uncomfortable moment before she finally decided to speak.“Mother Confessor, I think maybe Lord Rahl has lost his mind.”Kahlan’s immediate thought was to wonder if General Reibisch might believe thesame thing.“I thought D’Harans do not expect to understand their Lord Rahl and would notquestion his behavior.”“Lord Rahl also says he wants me to think for myself.”Kahlan put her hand over Cara’s. “How many times have we doubted him before?Remember the chicken that-wasn’t-a-chicken? We both thought he was crazy. Hewasn’t.”“This is not some monster chasing us. This is something much bigger.”“Cara, do you always follow Richard’s orders?”“Of course not. He must be protected and I can’t allow his foolishness tointerfere with my duty. I only follow his orders if they do not endanger him, orif they tell me to do what I would have done anyway, or if it involves his malepride.”“Did you always follow Darken Rahl’s orders?”Cara stiffened at the unexpected encounter with the name, as if speaking itmight summon him back from the world of the dead. “You followed Darken Rahl’sorders, no matter how foolish they were, or you were tortured to death.”“Which Lord Rahl do you respect?”“I would lay down my life for any Lord Rahl.” Cara hesitated, and then touchedher fingertips to the red leather over her heart. “But I could never feel thisway for any other. I . . . love Lord Rahl. Not like you love him, not like awoman loves a man, but it is still love. Sometimes I have dreams of how proud Iam to serve anddefend him, and sometimes I have nightmares that I will failhim.”Cara’s brow drew down with sudden dread. “You won’t tell him that I said I lovehim, will you? He must not know.”Kahlan smiled. “Cara, I think he already knows, because he has similar feelingsabout you, but if you don’t wish it, I won’t say anything.”Cara let out a sigh of relief. “Good.”“And what made you come to feel that way about him?”“Many things .... He wishes us to think for ourselves. He allows us to serve himby choice. No Lord Rahl has ever done that before. I know that if I said Iwished to quit him, he would let me go. He would not have me tortured to deathfor it. He would wish me a good life.”“That, and more, is what you value about him: he never pretended any claim toyour lives. He believes no such claim can ever rightfully exist. It’s the firsttime since you were captured and trained to be Mord-Sith, that you have felt thereality of freedom.“That, Cara, is what Richard wants for everyone.”She swished a hand, as if dismissing the seriousness of the whole thing. “Hewould be foolish to grant me my freedom if I asked for it. He needs me toomuch.”“You wouldn’t need to ask for your freedom, Cara, and you know it. You alreadyhave your freedom, and because of him you know that, too. That’s what makes hima leader you are honored to follow. That’s why you feel the way you do abouthim. He has earned your loyalty.”Cara mulled it over.“I still think he has lost his mind.”In the past, Richard had more than once expressed his faith that, given achance, people would do the right thing. That was what he had done with theMord-Sith. That was also what he had done with the people of Anderith. Now . . .Kahlan swallowed back her emotion. “Not his mind, Cara, but maybe his heart.”Cara, seeing the look on Kahlan’s face, dismissed the seriousness of the matterwith a shrug and a smile. “I guess we will simply have to bring him around tothe way things are going to be-talk some sense into him.”Cara dabbed away the remnant of a tear as it rolled down Kahlan’s cheek.“Before he comes back, how about getting that stupid wooden bowl for me?”Cara nodded and bent to retrieve it. Kahlan was already fretting, knowing howmuch it was going to hurt, but there was no avoiding it.Cara came up with the shallow bowl. “Before those men came, I was planning onmaking a fire and warming some water. I was going to give you a bed bath-youknow, with a soapy cloth and a bucket of warm water. I guess I can do it when weget where we are going.”Kahlan half closed her eyes with the dreamy thought of being at least somewhatclean and fresh. She thought she needed a bath even more than she needed thewooden bowl to relieve herself.“Cara, if you would do that for me, I would kiss your feet when I get better,and name you to the most important post I can think of.”“I am Mord-Sith.” Cara looked nonplussed. She finally drew the blanket down.“That is the most important post there is-except perhaps wife to the Lord Rahl.Since he already has a wife, and I am already Mord-Sith, I will have to becontent with having my feet kissed.”Kahlan chuckled, but a stab of pain through her abdomen and ribs brought it toan abrupt halt.Richard was a long time in returning. Cara had made Kahlan drink two cups ofcold tea heavily laced with herbs to dull the pain. It wouldn’t be long beforeshe was in a stupor, if not exactly asleep. Kahlan had been just about to yieldto Cara’s desire to go look for Richard, when he called from a distance to letthem know it was him.“Did you see any of the men?” Cara asked when he appeared in the doorway.With a straight finger, Richard swiped glistening beads of sweat off hisforehead. His damp hair was plastered to his neck. “No. They’re no doubt off toHartland to do some drinking and complaining. By the time they come back we’llbe long gone.”“I still say we should lie in wait and end the threat,” Cara muttered. Richardignored her.“I cut and stripped some stout saplings and used some canvas to make a litter.”He came closer and with a knuckle nudged Kahlan’s chin, as if to playfully buckup her courage. “From now on we’ll just let you stay on the litter, and then wecan move you in and out of the carriage without. . .” He had that look in hiseyes-that look that hurt her to see. He showed her a smile. “It will make iteasier on Cara and me.”Kahlan tried to face the thought with composure. “We’re ready then?”His gaze dropped as he nodded.“Good,” Kahlan said, cheerfully. “I’m in the mood for a nice ride. I’d like tosee some of the countryside.”He smiled, more convincingly this time, she thought. “You shall have it. Andwe’ll end up at a beautiful place. It’s going to take a while to get there,traveling as slow as we must, but it will be worth the journey, you’ll see.”Kahlan tried to keep her breathing even. She said his name over and over in herhead, telling herself that she would not forget it this time, that she would notforget her own name. She hated forgetting things; it made her feel a fool tolearn things she should have remembered but had forgotten. She was going toremember this time.“Well, do I have to get up and walk? Or are you going to be a gentleman andcarry me?”He bent and kissed her forehead-the one part on her face that the soft touch ofhis lips would not hurt. He glanced at Cara and tilted his head to signal her toget Kahlan’s legs.“Will those men be drinking a long time?” Kahlan asked.“It’s still midday. Don’t worry, we’ll be long gone before they ever get back’,here.”“I’m sorry, Richard. I know you thought these people from your homeland”“They’re people, just like everyone else.”She nodded as she fondly stroked the back of his big hand. “Cara gave me some ofyour herbs. I’ll sleep for a long time, so don’t go slow on my account-I won’tfeel it. I don’t want you to have to fight all those men.”“I won’t be doing any fighting just traveling my forests.”“That’s good.” Kahlan felt daggers twist in her ribs as her breathing startedgetting too fast. “I love you, you know. In case I forgot to say it, I loveyou.”Despite the pain in his gray eyes, he smiled. “I love you, too. Just try torelax. Cara and I will be as gentle as we can. We’ll go easy. There’s no rush.Don’t try to help us. Just relax. You’re getting better, so it won’t be sohard.”She had been hurt before and knew that it was always better to move yourselfbecause you knew exactly how to do it. But she couldn’t move herself this time.,She had come to know that the worst thing when you were hurt was to have someoneelse move you.As he leaned over, she slipped her right arm around his neck while he carefullyslid his left arm under her shoulders. Being lifted even that much ignited ashock of pain. Kahlan tried to ignore the burning stitch and attempted to relaxas she said his name over and over in her mind.She suddenly remembered something important. It was her last chance to remindhim.“Richard,” she whispered urgently just before he pushed his right arm under herbottom to lift her. “Please . . . remember to be careful not to hurt the baby.”She was startled to see her words stagger him. It took a moment before his eyesturned up to look into hers. What she saw there nearly stopped her heart.“Kahlan . . . you remember, don’t you?”“Remember?”His eyes glistened. “That you lost the baby. When you were attacked.”The memory slammed into her like a fist, nearly taking her breath.“...Oh...“Are you all right?”“Yes. I forgot for a moment. I just wasn’t thinking. I remember, now. I rememberyou told me about it.”And she did. Their child, their child that had only begun to grow in her, waslong since dead and gone. Those beasts who had attacked her had taken that fromher, too.The world seemed to turn gray and lifeless.“I’m so sorry, Kahlan,” he whispered.She caressed his hair. “No, Richard. I should have remembered. I’m sorry Iforgot. I didn’t mean to . . .”He nodded.She felt a warm tear drop onto the hollow of her throat, close to her necklace.The necklace, with its small dark stone, had been a wedding gift from Shota, thewitch woman. The gift was a proposal of truce. Shota said it would allow them tobe together and share their love, as they had always wanted, without Kahlangetting pregnant. Richard and Kahlan had decided that, for the time being, theywould reluctantly accept Shota’s gift, her truce. They already had worriesenough on their hands.But for a time, when the chimes had been loose in the world, the magic of thenecklace, unbeknownst to Richard and Kahlan, had failed. One small butmiraculous balance to the horrors the chimes had brought had been that it hadgiven their love the opportunity to bring a child to life.Now that life was gone.“Please, Richard, let’s go.”He nodded again.“Dear spirits,” he whispered to himself so softly she could hardly hear him,“forgive me for what I am about to do.”She clutched his neck. She now longed for what was coming-she wanted to forget.He lifted her as gently as he could. It felt like wild stallions tied to eachlimb all leaped into a gallop at the same instant. Pain ripped up from the coreof her, the shock of it making her eyes go wide as she sucked in a breath. Andthen she screamed.The blackness hit her like a dungeon door slamming shut."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4A sound woke her as suddenly as a slap. Kahlan lay on her back, still as death,her eyes wide, listening. It wasn’t so much that the sound had been loud, butthat it had been something disturbingly familiar. Something dangerous.Her whole body throbbed with pain, but she was more awake than she had been inwhat seemed like weeks. She didn’t know how long she had been asleep, or perhapsunconscious. She was awake enough to remember that it would be a grave mistaketo try to sit up, because just about the only part of her not injured was herright arm. One of the big chestnut geldings snorted nervously and stamped ahoof, jostling the carnage enough to remind Kahlan of her broken ribs.The sticky air smelled of approaching rain, though fits of wind still bore dustto her nostrils. Dark masses of leaves overhead swung fretfully to and fro,their creaking branches giving voice to their torment. Deep purple and violetclouds scudded past in silence. Beyond the trees and clouds, the field ofblue-black sky held a lone star, high over her forehead. She wasn’t sure if itwas dawn or dusk, but it felt like the death of day.As the gusts beat strands of her filthy hair across her face, Kahlan listened ashard as she could for the sound that didn’t belong, still hoping to fit it intoa picture of something innocent. Since she’d heard it only from the deepness ofsleep, its conscious identity remained frustratingly out of her reach.She listened, too, for sounds of Richard and Cara, but heard nothing. Surely,they would be close. They would not leave her alone-not for any reason this sideof death. She recoiled from the image. She ached to call out for Richard andprove the uninvited thought a foolish fear, but instinct screamed at her to staysilent. She needed no reminder not to move.A metallic clang came from the distance, then a cry. Maybe it was an animal, shetold herself. Ravens sometimes let out the most awful cries. Their shrill wailscould sound so human it was eerie. But as far as she knew, ravens didn’t makemetallic sounds.The carriage suddenly lurched to the right. Her breath caught as theunanticipated movement caused a stitch of pain in the back of her ribs. Someonehad put weight on the step. By the careless disregard for the carriage’s injuredpassenger, she knew it wasn’t Richard or Cara. But if it wasn’t Richard, thenwho? Gooseflesh tickled the nape of her neck. If it wasn’t Richard, where washe?Stubby fingers grasped the top of the corded chafing strip on the carriage’sside rail. The blunt fingertips were rounded back over grubby, gnawed-downlittle halfbutton fingernails. Kahlan held her breath, hoping he didn’t realizeshe was in the carriage.A face popped up. Cunning dark eyes squinted at her. The man’s four middle upperteeth were missing, leaving his eyeteeth looking like fangs when he grinned.“Well, well. If it ain’t the wife of the late Richard Cypher.”Kahlan lay frozen. This was just like her dreams. For an instant, she couldn’tdecide if it was only that, just a dream, or real.His shirt bore a dark patina of dirt, as if it was never removed for anything.Sparse, wiry hairs on his fleshy cheeks and chin were like early weeds in theplowed field of his pockmarked face. His upper lip was wet from his runny nose.He had no lower teeth in front. The tip of his tongue rested partway out betweenthe yawning gap of his smirk.He brought up a knife for her to see. He turned it this way and that, almost asif he were showing off a prized possession to a shy girl he was courting. Hiseyes kept flicking back and forth between the knife and Kahlan. The slipshod jobof sharpening appeared to have been done on rough granite, rather than on aproper whetstone. Dark blotches and rust stained the poorly kept cheap steel.But the scratched and chipped edge was no less deadly for any of it. His wicked,toothless grin widened with pleasure as her gaze followed the blade, watching itcarve careful slices of the air between them.She made herself look into his dark, sunken eyes, which peered out from puffyslits. “Where’s Richard?” she demanded in a level voice.“Dancing with the spirits in the underworld.” He cocked his head to one side.“Where’s the blond bitch? The one my friends said they saw before. The one withthe smart mouth. The one what needs to have her tongue shortened before I guther.”Kahlan glared at him so he would know she had no intention of answering. As thecrude knife advanced toward her, his stench hit her.“You would have to be Tommy Lancaster.”The knife paused. “How’d you know that?”Anger welled up from deep inside her. “Richard told me about you.”The eyes glittered with menace. His grin widened. “Yeah? What did he tell you?”“That you were an ugly toothless pig who wets his pants whenever he grins.Smells like he was right.”The smirking grin turned to a scowl. He raised up on the step and leaned in withthe knife. That was what Kahlan wanted him to do-to get close enough so shecould touch him.With the discipline borne of a lifetime of experience, she mentally shed heranger and donned the calm of a Confessor committed to a course of action. Once aConfessor was resolved to releasing her power, the nature of time itself seemedto change.She had but to touch him.A Confessor’s power was partly dependent on her strength. In her injuredcondition, she didn’t know if she would be able to call forth the requiredforce, and if she could, whether she would survive the unleashing of it, but sheknew she had no choice. One of them was about to die. Maybe both.He leaned his elbow on the side rail. His fist with the knife went for herexposed throat. Rather than watching the knife, Kahlan watched the little scars,like dusty white cobwebs caught on his knuckles. When the fist was close enough,she made her move to snatch his wrist.Unexpectedly, she discovered she was snugly enfolded in the blue blanket. Shehadn’t realized Richard had placed her on the litter he’d made. The blanket waswrapped around her and tightly tucked under the stretcher poles in order to holdher as still as possible and prevent her from being hurt when the carriage wasmoving. Her arm was trapped inside what was about to become her death shroud.Hot panic flared up as she struggled to free her right arm. She was in adesperate race with the blade coming for her throat. Pain knifed her injuredribs as she battled with the blanket. She had no time to cry out or to curse infrustration at being so unwittingly snared. Her fingers gathered a fold ofmaterial. She yanked at it, trying to pull some slack from under the litter shelay atop so she could free her arm.Kahlan had merely to touch him, but she couldn’t. His blade was going to be theonly contact between them. Her only hope was that maybe his knuckles would brushher flesh, or maybe he just might be close enough as he started to slice herthroat that she could press her chin against his hand. Then, she could releaseher power, if she was still alive-if he didn’t cut too deep, first.As she twisted and pulled at the blanket, it seemed to her an eternity as shewatched the blade poised over her exposed neck, an eternity to wait before shehad any hope of unleashing her power-an eternity to live. But she knew there wasonly an instant more before she would feel the ripping slash of that roughblade.It didn’t happen at all as she expected.Tommy Lancaster wrenched backward with an earsplitting shriek. The world aroundKahlan crashed back in a riot of sound and motion with the abrupt readjustmentto the discontinuation of her intent. Kahlan saw Cara behind him, her teethclenched in a grim commitment of her own. In her pristine red leather, she was aprecious ruby behind a clod of dirt.Bent into the Agiel pressed against his back, Tommy Lancaster had less hope ofpulling away from Cara than if she had impaled him on a meat hook. His tormentwould not have been more brutal to witness, his shrieks more painful to hear.Cara’s Agiel dragged up and around the side of his ribs as he collapsed to hisknees. Each rib the Agiel passed over broke with a sharp crack, like the soundof a tree limb snapping. Vivid red, the match of her leather, oozed over hisknuckles and down his fingers. The knife clattered to the rocky ground. A darkstain of blood grew on the side of his shirt until it dripped off the untuckedtails.Cara stood over him, an austere executioner, watching him beg for mercy. Insteadof granting it, she pressed her Agiel against his throat and followed him to theground. His eyes were wide and white all around as he choked.It was a slow, agonizing journey toward death. Tommy Lancaster’s arms and legswrithed as he began to drown in his own blood. Cara could have ended it quickly,but it didn’t appear she had any intention of doing so. This man had meant tokill Kahlan. Cara meant to extract a heavy price for the crime.“Cara!” Kahlan was surprised that she could get so much power into the shoutCara glanced back over her shoulder. Tommy Lancaster’s hands went to his throatand he gasped for air when she rose up to stand over him. “Cara, stop it.Where’s Richard? Richard may need your help.”Cara leaned down over Tommy Lancaster, pressed her Agiel to his chest, and gaveit a twist. His left leg kicked out once, his arms flopped to the side, and hewent still.Before either Cara or Kahlan could say anything, Richard, his face set in coldferocity, sprinted up toward the carriage. He had his sword to hand. The bladewas dark and wet.The instant Kahlan saw his sword, she comprehended what had awakened her. Thesound had been the Sword of Truth announcing its arrival in the evening air. Inher sleep, her subconscious recognized the unique ring of steel made by theSword of Truth when it was drawn, and she instinctively grasped the danger thatthat sound represented.On his way to Kahlan’s side, Richard only glanced at the lifeless body at Cara’sfeet.“Are you all right?”Kahlan nodded. “Fine.” Belatedly, yet feeling triumphant at the accomplishment,she pulled her arm free of the blanket.Richard turned to Cara. “Anyone else come up the road?”“No. Just this one.” She gestured with her Agiel toward the knife on the ground.“He intended to cut the Mother Confessor’s throat.”If Tommy Lancaster hadn’t already been dead, Richard’s glare would have finishedhim. “I hope you didn’t make it easy on him.”“No, Lord Rahl. He regretted his last vile act-I made certain of it.”With his sword, Richard indicated the surrounding area. “Stay here and keep youreyes open. I’m sure we got them all, but I’m going to check just to be certainno one else was holding back and trying to surprise us from another direction.”“No one will get near the Mother Confessor, Lord Rahl.”Dust rose in the gloomy light when he gave a reassuring pat to the shoulder ofone of the two horses standing in their harnesses. “Soon as I get back, I wantto get going. We should have enough moon-for a few hours, anyway. I know a safeplace to make camp about four hours up the road. That will get us a gooddistance away from all this.”He pointed with his sword. “Drag his body past the brush over there and roll himoff the edge, down into the ravine. I’d just as soon the bodies weren’t founduntil after we’re long gone and far away. Probably only the animals will everfind them way out here, but I don’t want to take any chances.”Cara snatched a fistful of Tommy Lancaster’s hair. “With pleasure.” He wasstocky, but the weight gave her no difficulty.Richard trotted soundlessly off into the gathering darkness. Kahlan listened tothe sound of the body scraping across the ground. She heard small branchessnapping as Cara pulled the dead weight through the brush, and then the muffledthuds and tumbling scree as Tommy Lancaster’s body rolled and bounced down asteep slope. It was a long time before Kahlan heard the final thump at thebottom of the ravine.Cara ambled back to the side of the carnage. “Everything all right with you?”She casually pulled off her armored gloves.Kahlan blinked at the woman. “Cara, he nearly had me.”Cara flicked her long blond braid back over her shoulder as she scanned thesurrounding area. “No he didn’t. I was standing right there behind him the wholetime. I was nearly breathing down his neck. I never took my eyes from his knife.He had no chance to harm you.” She met Kahlan’s gaze. “Surely, you must haveseen me.”“No, I didn’t.”“Oh. I thought you saw me.” Looking a little sheepish, she tucked most of thecuffs of the gloves behind her belt and folded the rest down over the front. “Iguess maybe you were too low in the carriage to see me there behind him. I hadmy attention on him. I didn’t mean to let him frighten you.”“If you were there the whole time, why did you allow him to nearly kill me?”“He did not nearly kill you.” Cara smiled without humor. “But I wanted to lethim believe it. It’s more of a shock, more of a horror, if you let them thinkthey’ve won. It crushes a man’s spirit to take him then, when you’ve caught himdead to rights.”Kahlan’s head was swimming in confusion and so she decided not to press theissue. “What’s going on? What’s happened? How long have I been asleep?”“We have been traveling for two days. You have been in and out of sleep, but youdidn’t know anything the times you were awake. Lord Rahl was fretful abouthurting you to get you into the carnage, and about having told you . . . whatyou forgot.”Kahlan knew what Cara meant: her dead baby. “And the men?”“They came after us. This time, though, Lord Rahl didn’t discuss it with them.”She seemed especially pleased about that. “He knew in enough time that they werecoming, so we weren’t taken by surprise. When they came charging in, some witharrows noched and some with their swords or axes out, he shouted atthem-once-giving them a chance to change their minds.”“He tried to reason with them? Even then?”“Well, not exactly. He told them to go home in peace, or they would all die.”“And then what?”“And then they all laughed. It only seemed to embolden them. They charged,arrows flying, swords and axes raised. So Lord Rahl ran off into the woods.”“He did what?”“Before they came, he had told me that he was going to make them all chase afterhim. As Lord Rahl ran, the one who thought he would cut your throat yelled atthe others to `get Richard, and finish him this time.’ Lord Rahl had hoped hewould draw them all away from you, but when that one went after you instead,Lord Rahl gave me a look and I knew what he wanted me to do.”Cara clasped her hands behind her back as she scrutinized the gatheringdarkness, keeping watch, should anyone try to surprise them. Kahlan’s thoughtsturned to Richard, and what it must have been like, all alone as they chasedhim.“How many men?”“I didn’t count them.” Cara shrugged. “Maybe two dozen.”“And you left Richard alone with two dozen men chasing after him? Two dozen menintent on killing him?”Cara shot Kahlan an incredulous look. “And leave you unprotected? When I knewthat toothless brute was going after you? Lord Rahl would have skinned me aliveif I had left you.”Tall and lean, shoulders squared and chin raised, Cara looked as pleased as acat licking mouse off its whiskers. Kahlan suddenly understood: Richard hadentrusted Cara with Kahlan’s life; the MordSith had proven that faith justified.Kahlan felt a smile stretch the partly healed cuts on her lips. “I just wish I’d, known you were standing there the whole time. Now, thanks to you, I won’t needthe wooden bowl.”Cara didn’t laugh. “Mother Confessor, you should know that I would never letanything happen to either of you.”Richard appeared out of the shadows as suddenly as he had vanished. He strokedthe horses reassuringly. As he moved down beside them, he quickly checked theneck collars, the trace chains, and the breaching to make sure it was allsecure.“Anything?” he asked Cara.“No, Lord Rahl. Quiet and clear.”He leaned in the carnage and smiled. “Well, as long as you’re awake, how about Itake you for a romantic moonlight ride?”She rested her hand on his forearm. “Are you all right?”“I’m fine. Not a scratch.”“That’s not what I meant.”His smile vanished. “They tried to kill us. Westland has just suffered its firstcasualties because of the influence of the Imperial Order.”“But you knew them.”“That doesn’t entitle them to misplaced sympathy. How many thousands have I seenkilled since I left here? I couldn’t even convince men I grew up with of thetruth. I couldn’t even get them to listen fairly. All the death and sufferingI’ve seen is ultimately because of men like this-men who refuse to see.“Their willful ignorance does not entitle them to my blood or life. They pickedtheir own path. For once, they paid the price.”He didn’t sound to her like a man who was quitting the fight. He still held thesword, was still in the grip of its rage. Kahlan caressed his arm, letting himknow that she understood. It was clear to her that even though he’d been justlydefending himself, and though he was still filled with the sword’s rage, hekeenly regretted what he’d had to do. The men, had they been able to killRichard instead, would have regretted nothing. They would have celebrated hisdeath as a great victory.“That was still perilous-making them all chase after you.”“No, it wasn’t. It drew them out of the open and into the trees. They had todismount. It’s rocky and the footing is poor, so they couldn’t rush me togetheror with speed, like they could out here on the road.“The light is failing; they thought that was to their advantage. It wasn’t. Inthe trees it was even darker. I’m wearing mostly black. It’s warm, so I’d leftmy gold cape behind, here in the carriage. The little bit of gold on the rest ofthe outfit only serves to break up the shape of a man’s figure in the near-dark,so they had an even harder time seeing me.“Once I took down Albert, they stopped thinking and fought with pure anger untilthey started seeing blood and death. Those men are used to brawls, not battles.They had expected an easy time murdering us-they weren’t mentally prepared tofight for their own lives. Once they saw the true nature of what was happening,they ran for their lives. The ones left, anyway. These are my woods. In theirpanic, they became confused and lost their way in the trees. I cut them off andended it.”“Did you get them all?” Cara asked, worried about any who might escape and bringmore men after them.“Yes. I knew most of them, and besides, I had their number in my head. I countedthe bodies to make sure I got them all.”“How many?” Cara asked.Richard turned to take up the reins. “Not enough for their purpose.” He clickedhis tongue and started the horses moving."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5Richard rose up and drew his sword. This time, when its distinctive sound rangout in the night, Kahlan was awake. Her first instinct was to sit up. Before sheeven had time to think better of it, Richard had crouched and gently restrainedher with a reassuring hand. She lifted her head just enough to see that it wasCara, leading a man into the harsh, flickering light of the campfire. Richardsheathed his sword when he saw who Cara had with her: Captain Meiffert, theD’Haran officer who had been with them back in Anderith.Before any other greeting, the man dropped to his knees and bent forward,touching his forehead to the soft ground strewn with pine needles.“Master Rahl guide us. Master Rahl teach us. Master Rahl protect us,” CaptainMeiffert beseeched in sincere reverence. “In your light we thrive. In your mercywe are sheltered. In your wisdom we are humbled. We live only to serve. Ourlives are yours.”When he had gone to his knees to recite the devotion, as it was called, Kahlansaw Cara almost reflexively go to her knees with him, so ingrained was theritual. The supplication to their Lord Rahl was something all D’Harans did. Inthe field they commonly recited it once or, on occasion, three times. At thePeople’s Palace in D’Hara, most people gathered twice a day to chant thedevotion at length.When he’d been a captive of Darken Rahl, Richard, often in much the samecondition as Tommy Lancaster just before he died, had himself been forced to hisknees by Mord-Sith and made to perform the devotion for hours at a time. Now,the Mord-Sith, like all D’Harans, paid that same homage to Richard. If theMord-Sith saw such a turn of events as improbable, or even ironic, they neversaid as much. What many of them had found improbable was that Richard hadn’t hadthem all executed when he became their Lord Rahl.It was Richard, though, who had discovered that the devotion to their Lord Rahlwas in fact a surviving vestige of a bond, an ancient magic invoked by one ofhis ancestors to protect the D’Haran people from the dream walkers. It had longbeen believed that the dream walkers-created by wizards to be weapons duringthat ancient and nearly forgotten great war-had vanished from the world. Theconjuring of strange and varied abilities-of instilling unnatural attributes inpeople-willing or not, had once been a dark art, the results always being at theleast unpredictable, often uncertain, and sometimes dangerously unstable.Somehow, some spark of that malignant manipulation had been passed downgeneration after generation, lurking unseen for three thousand years-until itrekindled in the person of Emperor Jagang,Kahlan knew something about the alteration of living beings to suit a purpose.Confessors were such people, as had been the dream walkers. In Jagang, Kahlansaw a monster created by magic. She knew many people saw the same in her. Muchas some people had blond hair or brown eyes, she had been born to grow tall,with warm brown hair, and green eyes-and the ability of a Confessor. She lovedand laughed and longed for things just the same as those born with blond hair orbrown eyes, and without a Confessor’s special ability.Kahlan used her power for valid, moral reasons. Jagang, no doubt, believed thesame of himself, and even if he didn’t, most of his followers certainly did.Richard, too, had been born with latent power. The ancient, adjunct defense ofthe bond was passed down to any gifted Rahl. Without the protection of the bondto Richard-the Lord Rahl-whether formally spoken or a silent heartfelt affinity,anyone was vulnerable to Jagang’s power as a dream walker.Unlike most other permutations conjured by wizards in living people, theConfessor’s ability had always remained vital; at least it had until all theother Confessors had been murdered by order of Darken Rahl. Now, without suchwizards and their specialized conjuring, only if Kahlan had children would themagic of the Confessors live on.Confessors usually bore girls, but not always. A Confessor’s power hadoriginally been created for, and had been intended to be used by, women. Likeall other conjuring that introduced unnatural abilities in people, this, too,had had unforeseen consequences: a Confessor’s male children, it turned out,also bore the power. After it had been learned how treacherous the power couldbe in men, all male children were scrupulously killed.Kahlan bearing a male child was precisely what the witch woman, Shota, feared.Shota knew very well that Richard would never allow his and Kahlan’s son to beslain for the past evils of male Confessors. Kahlan, too, could never allowRichard’s son to be killed. In the past, a Confessor’s inability to marry out oflove was one of the reasons she could emotionally endure the practice ofinfanticide. Richard, in discovering the means by which he and Kahlan could betogether, had altered that equation, too.But Shota didn’t simply fear Kahlan giving birth to a male Confessor; she fearedsomething of potentially far greater magnitude-a male Confessor who possessedRichard’s gift. Shota had foretold that Kahlan and Richard would conceive a malechild. Shota viewed such a child as an evil monster, dangerous beyondcomprehension, and so had vowed to kill their offspring. To prevent such a thingfrom being required, she had given them the necklace to keep Kahlan frombecoming pregnant. They had taken it reluctantly. The alternative was war withthe witch woman.It was for reasons such as this that Richard abhorred prophecy.Kahlan watched as Captain Meiffert spoke the devotion a third time, Cara’s lipsmoving with his. The soft chant was making Kahlan sleepy.It was a luxury for Kahlan to be able to be down with Richard and Cara in thesheltered camp, beside the warmth of the fire, rather than having to stay in thecarriage, especially since the night had turned chilly and damp. With the litterthey could move her more easily and without causing her much pain. Richard wouldhave made the litter sooner, but he hadn’t expected to have to abandon the househe had started to build.They were far off the narrow, forsaken road, in a tiny clearing concealed in acleft in a steep rock wall behind a dense expanse of pine and spruce. A smallmeadow close by provided a snug paddock for the horses. Richard and Cara hadpulled the carriage off the road, behind a mass of deadfall, and hidden it withspruce and balsam boughs. No one but a D’Haran bonded to their Lord Rahl hadmuch of a chance of ever finding them in the vast and trackless forest.The secluded spot had a fire pit Richard had dug and ringed with rocks during aprevious stay, nearly a year before. It hadn’t been used since. A protrudingshelf of rock about seven or eight feet above them prevented the light of thecampfire from shining up the rock wall, helping keep the camp hidden. Its slopealso kept them snug and dry in the drizzle that had begun to fall. With a fogclosing in, too, it was as protected and secure a campsite as Kahlan had everseen. Richard had been true to his word.It had taken more like six hours than four to reach the campsite. Richard hadproceeded slowly for Kahlan’s sake. It was late and they were all tired from along day of traveling, to say nothing of the attack. Richard had told her thatit looked like it might rain for a day or two, and they would stay in the campand rest up until the weather cleared. There was no urgency to get where theywere going.After the third devotion, Captain Meiffert came haltingly to his feet. Heclapped his right fist to the leather over his heart in salute. Richard smiledand the two men clasped forearms in a less formal greeting.“How are you doing, Captain?” Richard grasped the man’s elbow. “What’s thematter? Did you fall off your horse, or something?”The captain glanced at Cara, to his side. “Ah, well, I’m fine, Lord Rahl.Really.”“You look hurt.”“I just had my ribs . . . tickled, by your Mord-Sith, that’s all.”“I didn’t do it hard enough to break them,” Cara scoffed.“I’m truly sorry, Captain. We had a bit of trouble earlier today. Cara was nodoubt worried for our safety when she saw you approaching in the dark.”Richard’s eyes turned toward Cara. “But she still should have been more carefulbefore risking injuring people. I’m sure she’s sorry and will want toapologize.”Cara made a sour face. “It was dark. I’m not about to take any foolish chanceswith the life of our Lord Rahl just so-”“I would hope not,” Captain Meiffert put in before Richard could reprimand her.He smiled at Cara. “I was once kicked by a stalwart warhorse. You did a betterjob of putting me down, Mistress Cara. I’m gratified to find Lord Rahl’s life isin capable hands. If sore ribs are the price, I willingly accept it.”Cara’s face brightened. The captain’s simple concession disarmed a potentiallynettlesome situation.“Well, if the ribs bother you, let me know,” Cara said dryly, “and I’ll kissthem and make them better.” In the silence, as Richard glowered at her, shescratched her ear and finally added, “Anyway, sorry. But I didn’t want to takeany chances.”“As I said, a price I willingly pay. Thank you for your vigilance.”“What are you doing here, Captain?” Richard asked. “General Reibisch send you tosee if the Lord Rahl is crazy?”Although it was impossible to tell in the firelight, Kahlan was sure that theman’s face turned scarlet. “No, of course not, Lord Rahl. It’s just that thegeneral wanted you to have a full report.”“I see.” Richard glanced down at their dinner pot. “When’s the last time youate, Captain? You look a little drawn, besides having sore ribs.”“Well, ah, I’ve been riding hard, Lord Rahl. I guess yesterday I must have eatensomething. I’m fine, though. I can have something after-”“Sit down, then.” Richard gestured. “Let me get you something hot to eat. Itwill do you good.”As the man reluctantly settled down on the mossy ground beside Kahlan and Cara,Richard scooped some rice and beans into a bowl. He cut a big piece of bannockfrom what he’d left to cool on the griddle off to the side of the fire. He heldthe bowl out to the man. Captain Meiffert saw no way to prevent it, and was nowmortified to find himself being served by none other than the Lord Rahl himself.Richard had to lift the food toward him a second time before he took it. “It’sonly some rice and beans, Captain. It’s not like I’m giving you Cara’s hand inmarriage.”Cara guffawed. “Mord-Sith don’t marry. They simply take a man for a mate if theywish him-he gets no say in it.”Richard glanced up at her. Kahlan knew by Richard’s tone that he hadn’t meantanything by the comment but he didn’t laugh with Cara. He knew all too well thetruth of her words. Such an act was not an act of love, but altogether theopposite. In the uncomfortable silence, Cara realized what she’d said, anddecided to break some branches down and feed them to the fire.Kahlan knew that Denna, the Mord-Sith who had captured Richard, had taken himfor her mate. Cara knew it, too. When Richard would sometimes wake with a startand cling to her, Kahlan wondered if his nightmares were of things imaginary orreal. When she kissed his sweat-slicked brow and asked what he had dreamed, henever remembered. She was thankful for that much of it.Richard retrieved a long stick that had been propped against one of the rocksringing the fire. With his finger, he slid several sizzling pieces of bacon offthe stick and into the captain’s bowl, and then set the big piece of bannock ontop. They had with them a variety of food. Kahlan shared the carrage with allthe supplies Richard had picked up along their journey north to Hartland. Theyhad enough staples to last for a good long time.“Thank you,” Captain Meiffert stammered. He brushed back his fall of blond hair.“It looks delicious.”“It is,” Richard said. “You’re lucky: I made dinner tonight, instead of Cara.”Cara, proud of being a poor cook, smiled as if it were an accomplishment ofnote.Kahlan was sure it was a story that would be repeated to wide eyes and stunneddisbelief: the Lord Rahl himself serving food to one of his men. By the way thecaptain ate, she guessed it had been longer than a day since he had eaten. Asbig as he was, she figured he had to need a lot of food.He swallowed and looked up. “My horse.” He began to stand. “When Mistress Cara.. . I forgot my horse. I need-”“Eat your food.” Richard stood and clapped Captain Meiffert’s shoulder to keephim seated. “I was going to check on our horses anyway. I’ll see to yours aswell. I’m sure it would like some water and oats, too.”“But, Lord Rahl, I can’t allow you to-”“Eat. This will save time; when I get back, you’ll be done and then you can giveme your report.” Richard’s shape became indistinct as he dissolved into theshadows, leaving only a disembodied voice behind. “But I’m afraid I still won’thave any orders for General Reibisch.”In the stillness, crickets once again took up their rhythmic chirping. Somedistance away, Kahlan heard a night bird calling. Beyond the nearby trees, thehorses whinnied contentedly, probably when Richard greeted them. Every once in awhile a feather of mist strayed in under the overhang to dampen her cheek. Shewished she could turn on her side and close her eyes. Richard had given her someherb tea and it was beginning to make her drowsy. At least it dulled the pain,too.“How are you, Mother Confessor?” Captain Meiffert asked. “Everyone is terriblyworried about you.”A Confessor wasn’t often confronted with such honest and warm concern. The youngman’s simple question was so sincere it almost brought Kahlan to tears.“I’m getting better, Captain. Tell everyone I’ll be fine after I’ve had sometime to heal. We’re going someplace quiet where I can enjoy the fresh air of thearriving summer and get some rest. I’ll be better before autumn, I’m sure. Bythen, I hope Richard will be of the war.”The captain smiled. “Everyone will be relieved to know you’re healing. I can’ttell you how many people told me that when I return they want to hear how you’redoing.”“Tell them I said I’ll be fine and I asked for them not to worry anymore aboutme, but to take care of themselves.”He ate another spoonful. Kahlan saw in his eyes that there was more to the man’sanxiety. It took him a moment before he addressed it.“We are concerned, too, that you and Lord Rahl need protection.”Cara, already sitting straight, nevertheless managed to straighten more, at thesame time making the subtle shift in her posture appear threatening. “Lord Rahland the Mother Confessor are not without protection, Captain; they have me.Anything more than a Mord-Sith is just pretty brass buttons.”This time, he didn’t back down. His voice rang with the clear tone of authority.“This is not a matter of disrespect, Mistress Cara, nor is presumption intended.Like you, I am sworn to their safety, and that is my proper concern. These brassbuttons have met the enemy before in the defense of Lord Rahl, and I don’treally believe a Mord-Sith would want to deter me from that duty for no morereason than petty pride.”“We’re going to a remote and secluded place,” Kahlan said, before Cara couldanswer. “I think our solitude, and Cara, will be ample protection. If Richardwishes it otherwise, he will say so.”With a reluctant nod, he accepted her answer. The last of it, anyway, settledthe matter.When Richard had taken Kahlan north, he had left their guard forces behind. Sheknew it was deliberate, probably part of his conviction about what he felt hehad to do. Richard wasn’t opposed to the concept of protection; in the past, hehad accepted troops being with them. Cara, too, had been insistent on having thesecurity of those troops along. It was different, though, for Cara to admit itdirectly to Captain Meiffert.They had spent a good deal of time in Anderith with the captain and his eliteforces. Kahlan knew him to be a superb officer. She thought he must beapproaching his mid-twenties-probably a soldier for a decade already and theveteran of a number of campaigns, from minor rebellions to open warfare. Thesharp wholesome lines of his face were just beginning to take on a mature set.Over millennia, through war, migration, and occupation, other cultures had mixedin with the D’Haran, leaving a blend of peoples. Tall and broad-shouldered,Captain Meiffert was marked as full-blooded D’Haran by blond hair and blue eyes,as was Cara. The bond was strongest in full-blooded D’Harans.After he had finished about half his rice, he glanced over his shoulder, intothe darkness where Richard had gone. His earnest blue eyes took in both Cara andKahlan.“I don’t mean it to sound judgmental or personal, and I hope I’m not speakingout of turn, but may I ask you both a . . . a sensitive question?”“You may, Captain,” Kahlan said. “But I can’t promise we will answer it.”The last part gave him pause for a moment, but then he went on. “GeneralReibisch and some of the other officers . . . well, there have been worrieddiscussions about Lord Rahl. We trust in him, of course,” he was quick to add.“We really do. It’s just that . . .”“So what are your concerns, then, Captain?” Cara put in, her brow drawing tight.“If you trust him so much.”He stirred his wooden spoon around the bowl. “I was there in Anderith throughthe whole thing. I know how hard he worked-and you, too, Mother Confessor. NoLord Rahl before him ever worried about what the people wanted. In the past, theonly thing that mattered was what the Lord Rahl wanted. Then, after all that,the people rejected his offer-rejected him. He sent us back to the main force,and just left us”-he gestured around himself-”to come here. Out in the middle ofnowhere. To be a recluse, or something.” He paused while searching for the rightwords. “We don’t . . . understand it, exactly.”He looked up from the fire, back into their eyes, as he went on. “We’re worriedthat Lord Rahl has lost his will to fight-that he simply no longer cares. Orperhaps . . . he is afraid to fight?”The look on his face told Kahlan that he feared reprisal for saying the thingshe said, and for asking such a question, but he needed the answer enough to riskit. This was probably why he had come to give a report, rather than send asimple messenger.“About six hours before he cooked that nice dinner pot of rice and beans,” Carasaid in a casual manner, “he killed a couple dozen men. All by himself. Hackedthem apart like I’ve never seen before. The violence of it shocked even me. Heleft only one man for me to dispatch. Quite unfair of him, I think.”Captain Meiffert looked positively relieved as he let out a long breath. Helooked away from Cara’s steady gaze and back into his bowl to stir his dinner.“That news will be well received. Thank you for telling me, Mistress Cara.”“He can’t issue orders,” Kahlan said, “because he unequivocally believes that,for now, if he takes part in leading our forces against the Imperial Order, itwould bring about our defeat. He believes that if he enters the battle too soon,we will then have no chance of ever winning. He believes he must wait for theright time, that’s all. There’s nothing more to it.”Kahlan felt a bit conflicted, helping to justify Richard’s actions, when shewasn’t entirely in favor of them. She felt it was necessary to check the advanceof the Imperial Order’s army now, and not give them a chance to freely pillageand murder the people of the New World.The captain mulled this over as he ate some bannock. He frowned as he gesturedwith the piece he had left. “There is sound battle theory for such a strategy.If you have any choice in it, you only attack when it’s on your terms, not theenemy’s.”He became more spirited as he thought about it a moment. “It is better to holdan attack for the right moment, despite the damage an enemy can cause in theinterim, than to go into a battle before the right time. Such would be an act ofpoor command.”“That’s right.” Kahlan laid her arm back and rested her right wrist on her brow.“Perhaps you could explain it to the other officers in those words-that it’spremature to issue orders, and he’s waiting for the proper time. I don’t thinkthat’s really any different from the way Richard has explained it to us, butperhaps it would be better understood if put in such terms.”The captain ate the last bite of his bannock, seeming to think it over. “I trustLord Rahl with my life. I know the others do, too, but I think they will bereassured by such an explanation as to why he is withholding his orders. I cansee now why he had to leave us-it was to resist the temptation to throw himselfinto the fray before the time was right.”Kahlan wished she was as confident of the reasoning as the captain. She recalledCara’s question, wondering how the people could prove themselves to Richard. Sheknew he would not be inclined to try it through a vote again, but she didn’t seehow else the people could prove themselves to him.“I’d not mention it to Richard,” she said. “It’s difficult for him-not beingable to issue orders. He’s trying to do what he believes is right, but it’s adifficult course to hold to.”“I understand, Mother Confessor. `In his wisdom we are humbled. We live only toserve. Our lives are his.’ “Kahlan studied the smooth lines and simple angles of his young face lit by thedancing firelight. In that face, she saw some of what Richard had been trying tosay to her before. “Richard doesn’t believe your lives are his, Captain, butthat they are your own, and priceless. That is what he is fighting for.”He chose his words carefully; if he wasn’t worried about her being the MotherConfessor, since he hadn’t grown up fearing the power and the rule of such awoman, she was still the Lord Rahl’s wife.“Most of us see how different he is from the last Lord Rahl. I’m not claimingthat any of us understands everything about him, but we know he fights todefend, rather than to conquer. As a soldier, I know the difference it makes tobelieve in what I’m fighting for, because. . .”The captain looked away from her gaze. He lifted a short branch of firewood,tapping the end on the ground for a time. His voice took on a painfulinflection, “Because it takes something precious out of you to kill people whonever meant you any harm.”The fire crackled and hissed as he slowly stirred the glowing coals. Sparksswirled up to spill out from around the underside of the rock overhang.Cara watched her Agiel as she rolled it in her fingers. “You . . . feel that waytoo?”Captain Meiffert met Cara’s gaze. “I never realized, before, what it was doingto me, inside. I didn’t know. Lord Rahl makes me proud to be D’Haran. He makesit stand for something right .... It never did before. I thought that the waythings were, was just the way things were, and they could never change.”Cara’s gaze fell away as she privately nodded her agreement. Kahlan could onlyimagine what life was like living under that kind of rule, what it did topeople.“I’m glad you understand, Captain,” Kahlan whispered. “That’s one reason heworries so much about all of you. He wants you to live lives you can be proudof. Lives that are your own.”He dropped the stick into the fire. “And he wanted all the people of Anderith tocare about themselves the way he wants us to value our lives. The vote wasn’treally for him, but for themselves. That was why the vote meant so much to him?”“That’s why,” Kahlan confirmed, afraid to test her own voice any further thanthat.He stirred his spoon around to cool his dinner. It no longer needed cooling, shewas sure. She supposed his thoughts were being stirred more than his dinner.“You know,” he said, “one of the things I heard people say, back in Anderith,was that since Darken Rahl was his father, Richard Rahl was evil, too. They saidthat since his father had done wrong, Richard Rahl might sometimes do good, buthe could never be a good person.”“I heard that too,” Cara said. “Not just in Anderith, but a lot of places.”“That’s wrong. Why should people think that just because one of his parents wascruel, those crimes pass on to someone who never did them? And that he mustspend his life making amends? I’d hate to think that if I’m ever lucky enough tohave children, they, and then their children, and their children after that,would have to suffer forever for the things I’ve done serving under DarkenRahl.” He looked over at Kahlan and Cara. “Such prejudice isn’t right.”In the silence, Cara stared into the flames.“I served under Darken Rahl. I know the difference in the two men.” His voicelowered with simmering anger. “It’s wrong of people to lay guilt for the crimesof Darken Rahl onto his son.”“You’re right about that,” Cara murmured. “The two may look a little alike, butanyone who has ever looked into the eyes of both men, as I have, could neverbegin to think they were the same kind of men.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6Captain Meiffert ate the rest of his rice and beans in silence. Cara offered himher waterskin. He took it with a smile and his nod of thanks. She dished him outa second bowlful from the pot, and cut him another piece of bannock. He lookedonly slightly less mortified to be served by a Mord-Sith than by the Lord Rahl.Cara found his expression amusing. She called him “Brass Buttons” and told himto eat it all. He did so as they listened to the sounds of the fire snapping andwater dripping from the pine needles onto the carpet of leaves and other debrisof the forest floor.Richard returned, loaded down with the captain’s bedroll and saddlebags. He letthem slip to the ground beside the officer and then shook water off himselfbefore sitting down beside Kahlan. He offered her a drink from a full waterskinhe’d brought back. She took only a sip. She was more interested in being able torest her hand on his leg.Richard yawned. “So, Captain Meiffert, you said the general wanted you to give afull report?”“Yes, sir.” The captain went into a long and detailed account on the state ofthe army to the south, how they were stationed out on the plains, what passesthey guarded in the mountains, and how they planned on using the terrain, shouldthe Imperial Order suddenly come up out of Anderith and move north into theMidlands. He reported on the health of the men and their supply situation-bothgood. The other half of General Reibisch’s D’Haran force was back in Aydindril,protecting the city, and Kahlan was relieved to hear that everything there wasin order.Captain Meiffert relayed all the communications they’d received from around theMidlands, including from Kelton and Galen, two of the largest lands of theMidlands that were now allied with the new D’Haran Empire. The allied lands werehelping to keep the army supplied, in addition to providing men for rotation ofpatrols, scouting land they knew better, and other work.Kahlan’s half brother, Harold, had brought word that Cyrilla, Kahlan’s halfsister, had taken a turn for the better. Cyrilla had been queen of Galea. Afterher brutal treatment in the hands of the enemy, she became emotionallyunbalanced and was unable to serve as queen. In her rare conscious moments,worried for her people, she had begged Kahlan to be queen in her stead. Kahlanhad reluctantly agreed, saying it was only until Cyrilla was well again. Fewpeople thought she would ever have her mind back, but, apparently, it looked asif she might yet recover.In order to soothe the ruffled feathers of Galea’s neighboring land, Kelton,Richard had named Kahlan queen of Kelton. When Kahlan first heard what Richardhad done, she had thought it was lunacy. Strange as the arrangement was, though,if suited both lands, and brought them not only peace with each other, but alsointo the fold of those lands fighting against the Imperial Order.Cara was pleasantly surprised to hear that a number of Mord-Sith had arrived atthe Confessors’ Palace in Aydindril, in case Lord Rahl needed them. Berdinewould no doubt be pleased to have some of her sister Mord-Sith with her inAydindril.Kahlan missed Aydindril. She guessed the place you grew up could never leaveyour heart. The thought gave her a pang of sorrow for Richard.“That would be Rikka,” Cara said with a smile. “Wait until she meets the newLord Rahl,” she added under her breath, finding that even more to smile about.Kahlan’s thoughts turned to the people they had left to the Imperial Order-ormore accurately, to the people who had chosen the Imperial Order. “Have youreceived any reports from Anderith?”“Yes, from a number of men we sent in there. I’m afraid we lost some, too. Theones who returned report that there were fewer enemy deaths from the poisonedwaters than we had hoped. Once the Imperial Order discovered their soldiersdying, or sick, they tested everything on the local people, first. A number ofthem died or became sick, but it wasn’t widespread. By using the people to testthe food and water, they were able to isolate the tainted food and destroy it.The army has been been laying claim to everything-they use a lot of supplies.”The Imperial Order was said to be far larger than any army ever assembled.Kahlan knew that much of the reports to be accurate. The Order dwarfed theD’Haran and Midland troops arrayed against them perhaps ten or twenty to onesomereports claimed more than that. Some reports claimed the New World forces wereoutnumbered by a hundred to one, but Kahlan discounted that as outright panic.She didn’t know how long the Order would feed off Anderith before they moved on,or if they were being resupplied from the Old World. They had to be, to someextent, anyway.“How many scouts and spies did we lose?” Richard asked.Captain Meiffert looked up. It was the first question Richard had asked. “Somemay yet turn up, but it appears likely that we lost fifty to sixty men.”Richard sighed. “And General Reibisch thinks it was worth losing the lives ofthose men to discover this?”Captain Meiffert cast about for an answer. “We didn’t know what we woulddiscover, Lord Rahl; that was why we sent them in. Do you wish me to tell thegeneral not to send in any more men?”Richard was carving a face in a piece of firewood, sporadically tossing shavingsinto the fire. He sighed.“No, he must do as he sees fit. I’ve explained to him that I can’t issueorders.”The captain, watching Richard pick small chips of wood from his lap and pitchthem into the fire, tossed a small fan of pine needles into the flames, where itblazed in short-lived glory. Richard’s carving was a remarkably good likeness ofthe captain.Kahlan had, on occasion, seen Richard casually carve animals or people. She oncehad strongly suggested that his ability was guided by his gift. He scoffed atsuch a notion, saying that he had liked to carve ever since he was little. Shereminded him that art was used to cast spells, and that once he had beencaptured with the aid of a drawn spell.He insisted this was nothing like that. As a guide, he said he’d passed many anevening at camp, by himself, carving. Not wanting to carry the added weight, hewould toss the finished piece into the fire. He said he enjoyed the act ofcarving, and could always carve another. Kahlan considered the carvings inspiredand found it distressing to see them destroyed.“What do you intend to do, Lord Rahl? If I may ask.”Richard took a smooth, steady slice that demarcated the line of an ear, bringingit to life along with the line of the jaw he had already cut. He looked up andstared off into the night.“We’re going to a place back in the mountains, where other people don’t go, sowe can be alone, and safe. The Mother Confessor will be able to get well thereand gain back her strength. While we’re there, I may even make Cara startwearing a dress.”Cara shot to her feet. “What!” When she saw Richard’s smile, Cara realized hewas only joking. She fumed, nonetheless.“I’d not report that part of it to the general, were I you, Captain,” Richardsaid.Cara sank back down to the ground. “Not if Brass Buttons, here, values hisribs,” she muttered.Kahlan struggled not to chuckle, lest she twist the ever present knives in herribs. Sometimes, she felt as if she knew how the chunk of wood Richard wascarving felt. It was good to see Richard, for once, get the best of Cara. It wasusually she who had him flustered.“I can’t help you, for now,” Richard said, his serious tone returning. He wentback to his work with his knife. “I hope you can all accept that.”“Of course, Lord Rahl. We know that you will lead us into battle when the timeis right.”“I hope that day comes, Captain. I really do. Not because I want to fight, butbecause I hope there to be something to fight for.” Richard stared into thefire, his countenance a chilling vision of despair. “Right now, there isn’t.”“Yes, Lord Rahl,” Captain Meiffert said, finally breaking the uncomfortablesilence. “We will do as we think best until the Mother Confessor is better andyou are then able to join us.”Richard didn’t argue the time schedule, as the captain had described it. It wasone Kahlan hoped for, too, but Richard had never said it would be that soon. Hehad, in fact, made it clear to them that the time might not ever come. Hecradled the wood in his lap, studying what he had done.He ran his thumb along the fresh-cut line of the nose as he asked, “Did thereturning scouts say . . . how it faired for the people in Anderith . . . withthe Imperial Order there?”Kahlan knew he was only torturing himself by asking that question. She wished hehadn’t asked; it could do him no good to hear the answer.Captain Meiffert cleared his throat. “Well, yes, they did report on thecondiions.“And . . .?”The young officer launched into a cold report of the facts they knew. “Jagangset up his troop headquarters in the capital, Fairfield. He took over theMinister of Culture’s estate for himself. Their army is so huge that itswallowed the city and overflows far out onto the hills all around. The Anderitharmy put up little resistance. They were collected and all summarily put todeath. The government of Anderith for the most part ceased to exist within thefirst few hours. There is no rule or law. The Order spent the first week inunchecked celebration.“Most people in Fairfield were displaced and lost everything they owned. Manyfled. The roads all around were packed solid with those trying to escape whatwas happening in the city. The people fleeing the city only ended up being thespoils for the soldiers in the hills all around who couldn’t fit into the city.Only a trickle mostly the very old and sickly-made it past that gauntlet.”His impersonal tone abandoned him. He had spent time with those people, too.“I’m afraid that, in all, it went badly for them, Lord Rahl. There was ahorrendous amount of killing, of the men, anyway-in the tens of thousands.Likely more.”“They got what they asked for.” Cara’s voice was as cold as winter night. “Theypicked their own fate.” Kahlan agreed, but didn’t say so. She knew Richardagreed, too. None of them were pleased about it, though.“And the countryside?” Richard asked. “Anything known about places outsideFairfield? Is it going better for them?”“No better, Lord Rahl. The Imperial Order has been methodically going about aprocess of `pacifying’ the land, as they call it. Their soldiers are accompaniedby the gifted.“By far, the worst of the accounts were about one called `Death’s Mistress.’ ““Who?” Cara asked.“ `Death’s Mistress,’ they call her.”“Her. Must be the Sisters,” Richard said.“Which ones do you think it would be?” Cara asked.Richard, cutting the mouth into the firewood face, shrugged. “Jagang has bothSisters of the Light and Sisters of the Dark held captive. He’s a dream walker;he forces both to do his bidding. It could be either; the woman is simply histool.”“I don’t know,” Captain Meiffert said. “We’ve had plenty of reports about theSisters, and how dangerous they are. But they’re being used like you said, astools of the army-weapons, basically-not as his agents. Jagang doesn’t let themthink for themselves or direct anything.“This one, from the reports, anyway, behaves very differently from the others.She acts as Jagang’s agent, but still, the word is she decides things forherself, and does as she pleases. The men who came back reported that she ismore feared than Jagang himself.“The people of one town, when they heard she was coming their way, all gatheredtogether in the town square. They made the children drink poison first, then theadults took their dose. Every last person in the town was dead when the womanarrived-close to five hundred people.”Richard had stopped carving as he listened. Kahlan knew that unfounded rumorscould also be so lurid as to turn alarm into deadly panic, to the point wherepeople would rather die than face the object of their dread. Fear was a powerfultool of war.Richard went back to the carving in his lap. He held the knife near the tip ofthe point, like a pen, and carefully cut character into the eyes. “They didn’tget a name for her, did they? This Death’s Mistress?”“I’m sorry, no, Lord Rahl. They said she is simply called by everyone `Death’sMistress.’ ““Sounds like an ugly witch,” Cara said.“Quite the contrary. She has blue eyes and long blond hair. She is said to beone of the most beautiful women you could ever lay eyes upon. They say she lookslike a vision of a good spirit.”Kahlan couldn’t help notice the captain’s furtive glance at Cara, who had blueeyes and long blond hair, and was also one of the most beautiful women you couldever lay eyes upon. She, too, was deadly.Richard was frowning. “Blond. . . blue eyes . . . there are several it could be.... Too bad they didn’t catch her name.”“Sorry, but they gave no other name, Lord Rahl, only that description .... Ohyes, and that she always wears black.”“Dear spirits,” Richard whispered as he rose to his full height, gripping hiscarving by its throat.“From what I’ve been told, Lord Rahl, though she looks like a vision of one, thegood spins themselves would fear her.”“With good reason.” Richard said, as he stared into the distance, as if lookingbeyond the black wall of mist to a place only he could see.“You know her, then, Lord Rahl?”Kahlan listened to the fire pop and crackle as she waited along with the othertwo for his answer. It almost seemed Richard was trying to find his voice as hisgaze sank back down to meet the eyes of the carving in his hand.“I know her,” he said, at last. “I know her all too well. She was one of myteachers at the Palace of the Prophets.”Richard tossed his carving into the flames.“Pray you never have to look into Nicci’s eyes, Captain.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7“Look into my eyes, child,” Nicci said in her soft, silken voice as she cuppedthe girl’s chin.Nicci lifted the bony face. The eyes, dark and wide-set, blinked with dullbewilderment. There was nothing to be seen in them: the girl was simple.Nicci straightened, feeling a hollow disappointment. She always did. Shesometimes found herself looking into people’s eyes, like this, and thenwondering why. If she was searching for something, she didn’t know what it was.She resumed her leisurely walk down the line of the townspeople, all assembledalong one side of the dusty market square. People in outlying farms and smallercommunities no doubt came into the town several times a month, on market days,some staying overnight if they had come from far away. This wasn’t a market day,but it would suit her purpose well enough.A few of the crowded buildings had a second story, typically a room or two for afamily over their small shop. Nicci saw a bakery, a cobbler’s shop, a shopselling pottery, a blacksmith, an herbalist, a shop offering leatherwork-theusual places. One of these towns was much the same as the next. Many of thetown’s people worked the surrounding fields of wheat or sorghum, tended animals,and had extensive vegetable plots. Dung, straw, and clay being plentiful, theylived in homes of daub and wattle. A few of the shops with a second storyboasted beam construction with clapboard siding.Behind her, sullen soldiers bristling with weapons filled the majority of thesquare. They were tired from the hot ride, and worse, bored. Nicci knew theywere a twitch away from a rampage. A town, even one with meager plunder, was aninviting diversion. It wasn’t so much the taking as the breaking that theyliked. Sometimes, though, it was the taking. The nervous women only rarely metthe soldiers’ bold stares.As she strolled past the scruffy people, Nicci looked into the eyes watchingher. Most were wide with terror and fixed not on the soldiers, but on the objectof their dread: Nicci-or as people had taken to calling her, “Death’s Mistress.”The designation neither pleased nor displeased her; it was simply a fact shenoted, a fact of no more significance to her than if someone had told her thatthey had mended a pair of her stockings.Some, she knew, were staring at the gold ring through her lower lip. Gossipwould have already informed them that a woman so marked was a personal slave toEmperor Jagang-something lower even than simple peasants such as themselves.That they stared at the gold ring, or what they thought of her for it, was ofeven less significance to her than being called “Death’s Mistress.”Jagang only possessed her body in this world; the Keeper would have her soul foreternity in the next. Her body’s existence in this world was torment; herspirit’s existence in the next would be no less. Existence and torment weresimply the two sides of the same coin-there could be no other.Smoke, rolling up from the fire pit over her left shoulder, sailed away on afitful wind to make a dark slash across the bright blue afternoon sky. Stackedstones to each side of the communal cooking pit supported a rod above the fire.Two or three pigs or sheep, skewered on the rod, could be roasted at once.Temporary sides were probably available to convert the fire pit into asmokehouse.At other times, an outdoor fire pit was used, often in conjunction withbutchering, for the making of soap, since making soap was not somethingtypically done indoors. Nicci saw a wooden ash pit, used for making lye,standing to the side of the open area, along with a large iron kettle that couldbe used for rendering fat. Lye and fat were the primary ingredients of soap.Some women liked to add fragrance to their soap with herbs and such, likelavender or rosemary.When Nicci was little, her mother made her go each autumn, when the butcheringwas being done, to help people make soap. Her mother said helping others builtproper character. Nicci still had a few small dots of scars on the backs of herhands and forearms where she had been splashed and blistered by the hot fat.Nicci’s mother always made her wear a fine dress-not to impress the other peoplewho didn’t have such clothes, but to make Nicci conspicuous and uncomfortable.The attention her pink dress attracted was not admiration. As she stood with thelong wooden paddle, stirring the bubbling kettle while the lye was being pouredin, some of the other children, trying to splash the dress and ruin it, burnedNicci, too. Nicci’s mother had said the burns were the Creator’s punishment.As Nicci moved past, inspecting the assembled people, the only sounds were thehorses off behind the buildings, the sporadic coughs of people, and the flags offlame in the fire pit snapping and flapping in the breeze. The soldiers hadalready helped themselves to the two pigs that had been roasting on the rod, sothe aroma of cooking meat had mostly dissipated on the wind, leaving the soursmells of sweat and the stink of human habitation. Whether a belligerent army ora peaceful town, the filth of people smelled the same.“You all know why I’m here,” Nicci announced. “Why have you people made me go tothe trouble of such a journey?” She gazed down the line of maybe two hundredpeople standing four and five deep. The soldiers, who had ordered them out oftheir homes and in from the fields, greatly outnumbered them. She stopped infront of a man she had noticed people glancing at.“Well?”The wind fluttered his thin gray hair across his balding, bowed head as he fixedhis gaze on the ground at her feet. “We don’t have anything to give, Mistress.We’re a poor community. We have nothing.”“You are a liar. You had two pigs. You saw fit to have a gluttonous feastinstead of helping those in need.”“But we have to eat.” It was not an argument, so much as a plea.“So do others, but they are not so fortunate as you. They know only the ache ofhunger in their bellies every night. What an ugly tragedy, that every daythousands of children die from the simple want of food, and millions more knowthe gnawing pain of hunger-while people like you, in a land of plenty, offernothing but selfish excuses. Having what they need to live is their right, andmust be honored by those with the means to help.“Our soldiers, too, need to eat. Do you think our struggle on the behalf of thepeople is easy? These men risk their lives daily so you may raise your childrenin a proper, civilized society. How can you look these men in the eye? How canwe even feed our troops, if everyone doesn’t help support the cause?”The trembling man remained mute.“What must I do to impress upon you people the seriousness of your obligation tothe lives of others? Your contribution to those in need is a solemn moraldutysharing in a greater good.”Nicci’s vision suddenly went white. With a pain like scorching hot needlesdriven into her ears, Jagang’s voice filled her mind.Why must you play this game? Make examples of people! Teach them a lesson that Iam not to be ignored!Nicci swayed on her feet. She was completely blinded by the pain bursting insideher head. She let it wash through her, as if watching it happen to a stranger.Her abdominal muscles twitched and convulsed. A rusty, barbed lance driven upthrough her, ripping her insides, could not have hurt more. Her arms hung limpat her sides while she waited for Jagang’s displeasure to end, or for death.She was unable to tell how long the torture lasted. When he was doing it, shewas never able to sense time-the pain was too all-consuming. She knew, from whatothers told her when they saw it done to her, and from seeing it done to others,that it sometimes lasted only an instant. Sometimes it lasted hours.Making it last hours was a waste of Jagang’s effort-she couldn’t tell thedifference. She had told him as much.Suddenly, she was unable to draw a breath. It felt like a fist squeezed herheart to a stop. She thought her lungs might burst. Her knees were about tobuckle.Do not disobey me again!With a gasp, air filled her lungs. Jagang’s discipline ended, as it always did,with an impossibly tart, sour taste on her tongue, like an unexpected mouthfulof fresh raw lemon juice, and pain searing the nerves at the back of her jawunder her earlobes. It left her head ringing and her teeth throbbing. As sheopened her eyes, she was surprised, as she always was, not to see herselfstanding in a pool of blood. She touched the corner of her mouth, and thenbrushed her fingers to an ear. She found no blood.She wondered in passing why Jagang had been able to come into her mind now.Sometimes, he couldn’t. It didn’t happen that way for any of the otherSisters-he always had access to their minds.As her vision cleared, she saw people staring at her. They didn’t know why shehad paused. The young men-and a few of the older ones, too-were sneaking peeksat her body. They were used to seeing women in drab, shapeless dresses, womenwhose bodies exhibited the toll taken by endless hard work and almost constantpregnancy from the time they were old enough for the seed to catch. They hadnever before seen a woman like Nicci, standing straight and tall, looking themin the eye, wearing a fine black dress that hugged a nearly flawless shapemarred by neither hard work or the labor of birth. The stark black materialcontrasted the pale curve of cleavage revealed by the cut of the laced bodice.Nicci was numb to such stares. Occasionally, they suited her purposes, but mostof the time they didn’t, and so she disregarded them.She began walking down the line of people again, ignoring Emperor Jagang’sorders. She rarely complied with his orders. She was, for the most part,indifferent to his punishment. If anything, she welcomed it.Nicci, forgive me. You know I don’t mean to hurt you.She ignored his voice, too, as she studied the eyes peering up at her. Noteveryone did. She liked to look into the eyes of those courageous enough to riska glimpse of her. Most were filled with simple terror.There would soon be abundant justification for such apprehension.Nicci, you must do as I tell you, or you are only going to end up forcing me todo something terrible to you. Neither of us wants that. Someday, I am going toend up doing something from which you will be unable to recover.If that is what you wish to do, then do it, she thought, in answer.It was not a challenge; she simply didn’t care.You know I don’t want to do that, Nicci.Without the pain, his voice was little more than a fly annoying her. She paid itno heed. She addressed the crowd.“Do you people have any concept of the effort being put into the fight for yourfuture? Or is it that you expect to benefit without contributing? Many of ourbrave men have given their lives fighting the oppressors of the people, fightingfor our new beginning. We struggle so that all people will be able to shareequally in the coming prosperity. You must help us in our effort on your behalf.Just as helping those in need is the moral obligation of every person, so, too,is this.”Commander Kardeef, displaying a look of sour displeasure, planted himself infront of her. The sunlight slanting across his lined face cast his hooded eyesin deep shadows. She was not moved by his disfavor. He was never satisfied withanything. Well, she corrected herself, almost never.“People can only achieve virtue through obedience and sacrifice. Yourcontribution to the Order is to implement their compliance. We are not here tohold civic lessons!”Commander Kardeef was confident in his privileged mastery over her. He, too, hadgiven her pain. She endured what Kadar Kardeef did to her with the samedetachment with which she endured what Jagang did to her.Only in the furthest depths of pain could she begin to feel anything. Even painwas preferable to the nothingness she usually felt.Kadar Kardeef was probably unaware of the punishment Jagang had just completed,or his orders; His Excellency didn’t use Commander Kardeef’s mind. It was anarduous undertaking for Jagang to control those who didn’t possess the gift-hecould do it, but it was rarely worth his effort; he had the gifted to controlpeople for him. A dream walker somehow used the gift in those who possessed itin order to help complete the connection to their minds. In a way, the giftedmade it possible for Jagang to so easily control them.Kadar Kardeef glowered down at her as she gazed up at his darkly tanned creasedface. He was an imposing figure, with the studded leather straps that crossedhis massive chest, his armored leather shoulder and breast plates, his chainmail, array of well-used weapons. Nicci had seen him crush men’s throats in oneof big, powerful hands. As silent witness to his bravery in battle, he bore anumber scars. She had seen them all.Few officers ranked higher or were more trusted than Kadar Kardeef. He been withthe Order since his youth, rising through the ranks to fight alongside ‘ Jagangas they expanded the empire of the Imperial Order out of their homelandAltur’Rang to eventually subjugate the rest of the Old World. Kadar Kardeef wasthe hero of the Little Gap campaign, the man who almost single-handedly thecourse of the battle, breaking through enemy lines and personally slaying thethree great kings who had joined forces to trap and crush the Imperial Orderbefore it could seize the imaginations of the millions of people living in apatchwork of kingdoms, fiefdoms, clans, city-states, and vast regions controlledby alliances of warlords.The Old World had been a tinderbox, waiting for the spark of revolution. Thepreachings of the Order were that spark. If the high priests were the Order’ssoul, Jagang was its bone and muscle. Few people understood Jagang’s genius-theysaw only a dream walker, or a ferocious warrior. He was far more.It had taken Jagang decades to finally bring the rest of the Old World toheel-to put the Order on its final path to greater glory. During those years ofstruggle for the Order, while engaged in nearly constant war, Jagang toiledbuilding the road system that allowed him to move men and supplies greatdistances with lightning speed. The more lands and peoples he annexed, the morelaborers he put to the construction of yet more roads by which he could conqueryet more territory. He was thus able to maintain communications and to react tosituations faster than anyone would have believed possible. Formerly isolatedlands were suddenly connected to the rest of the Old World. Jagang had knittedthem together with a net of roads. Along those roads, the people of the OldWorld had risen up to follow him as he forged the way for the Order.Kadar Kardeef had been part of it all. More than once he had taken wounds tosave Jagang’s life. Jagang had once taken a bolt from a crossbow to saveKardeef. If Jagang could be said to have a friend, Kadar Kardeef was as close asany came to it.Nicci first met Kardeef when he had come to the Palace of the Prophets inTanimura to pray. Old King Gregory, who had ruled the land including Tanimura,had disappeared without a trace. Kadar Kardeef was a solemnly devout man; beforebattle he prayed to the Creator for the blood of the enemy, and after, for thesouls of the men he had killed. That day he was said to have prayed for the soulof King Gregory. The Imperial Order was suddenly the new rule in Tanimura. Thepeople celebrated in the streets for days.Over the course of three thousand years, the Sisters, from their home at thePalace of the Prophets in Tanimura, had seen governments come and go. For themost part, the Sisters, led by their prelate, considered matters of rule a pettyfoolishness best ignored. They believed in a higher calling. The Sistersbelieved they would remain at the Palace of the Prophets, undisturbed in theirwork, long after the Order had vanished into the dust of history. Revolutionshad many times come and gone. This one, though, caught them up.Kadar Kardeef had been nearly twenty years younger, then-a handsome conquerorriding into the city. Many of the Sisters were fascinated by the man. Niccinever was. But he was fascinated by her.Emperor Jagang, of course, did not send such invaluable men as Commander Kardeefout to pacify conquered lands. He had entrusted Kardeef with a much moreimportant task: guarding his valuable property-Nicci.Nicci turned her attention away from Kadar Kardeef and back to the people.She settled her gaze on the man who had spoken before. “We cannot allow anyoneto shirk their responsibility to others and to our new beginning.”“Please, Mistress . . . We have nothing-”“Disregard of our cause is treasonous.”He thought better of disagreeing with that pronouncement.“You don’t seem to understand that this man behind me wants you to see that theImperial Order is resolute in their devotion to their cause-if you don’t do yourduty. I know you have heard the stories, but this man wants you to experiencethe grim reality. Imagining it is never quite the same. Never quite asgruesome.”She stared at the man, waiting for his answer. He licked his weather-crackedlips,“We just need some more time .... Our crops are doing well. When the harvestcomes in . . . we could contribute our fair share toward the struggle for . . .for. . .”“The new beginning.”“Yes, Mistress,” he said, bobbing his head, “the new beginning.” When his gazereturned to the dirt at his feet, she moved on down the line.Her purpose was not really to collect, but to kill.The time had come.A girl gazing up at her snagged Nicci to a stop, distracting her from what shehad intended. The girl’s big, dark eyes sparkled with innocent wonder.Everything was new to her, and she was eager to see it all. In her dark eyesshone that rare, fragile, and most perishable of qualities: a guileless view oflife that had yet to be touched by pain or loss or evil.Nicci cupped the girl’s chin, staring into the depths of those thirsting eyes.One of Nicci’s earliest memories was of her mother standing over her like this,holding her chin, looking down at her. Nicci’s mother was gifted, too. She saidthat’, the gift was a curse, and a test. It was a curse because it gave herabilities others didn’t have, and it was a test to see if she would wronglyexert that superiority. Nicci’s mother almost never used her gift. Servantshandled the work; she spent most of her time nested among her clutch of friends,devoting herself to higher pursuits.“Dear Creator, but Nicci’s father is a monster,” she would complain as she wrungher hands. Some of her friends would murmur their sympathy. “Why must he burdenme so! I fear his eternal soul is beyond hope or prayer.” The other women wouldask in grim agreement.Her mother’s eyes were the same dull brown as a cockroach’s back. To Nicci’smind, they were set too close together. Her mouth, too, was narrow, as if fixedis -. place by her perpetual disapproval. While Nicci never really thought ofher mother as homely, neither did she consider her beautiful, although herfriends regularly reassured her that she most surely was.Nicci’s mother said beauty was a curse to a caring woman and a blessing only towhores.Puzzled by her mother’s displeasure of her father, Nicci had finally askedwhyhad done.“Nicci,” her mother had said, cupping Nicci’s small chin that day. Nicci eagerlyawaited her mother’s words. “You have beautiful eyes, but you do not yet seewith .them. All people are miserable wretches, that is the lot of man. Do youhave any idea how it hurts those without all your advantages to see yourbeautiful face? That , is all you bring to others: insufferable pain. TheCreator brought you into the world for no reason but to ease the misery ofothers, and here you bring only hurt.” Her mother’s friends, sipping tea,nodded, whispering to one another their sorrowful but firm agreement.That was when Nicci had first learned that she bore the indelible stain of soshadowy, nameless, unconfessed evil.Nicci gazed into the rare face looking up at her. Today this girl’s dark eyeswould see things they could not yet imagine. Those big eyes eagerly watchedwithout seeing. She could not possibly understand what was to come, or why.What kind of life could she have?It would be for the best, this way.The time had come."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Before she could begin, Nicci saw something that ignited her indignation. Shewhirled to a nearby woman.“Where is there a washtub?”Surprised by the question, the woman pointed a trembling finger toward a twostory building not far off. “There, Mistress. In the yard behind the potteryshop are laundry tubs where we were washing clothes.”Nicci seized the woman by her throat. “Get me a pair of scissors. Bring them tome there.” The woman stared in wide-eyed fright. Nicci shoved her. “Now! Orwould you prefer to die on the spot?”Nicci yanked free a well-worn, reserve studded strap bunched with several othersand secured over Commander Kardeef’s shoulder. He made no effort to stop her,but as she gathered up the strap, he seized her upper arm in his powerful grip.“You had better be planning on drowning this little brat-or maybe cutting offhunks of her hide and then stabbing out her eyes.” His breath smelled of onionand ale. He smirked. “In fact, you start in on her, and while she’s screamingand begging for her life, I’ll begin separating out some young men, or perhapsI’ll select some women to be an example. Which would you prefer, this time?”Nicci turned her glare down at his fingers on her arm. He removed them as hegrowled a warning. She turned to the girl and whipped the strap twice around herneck to serve as a collar, twisting it into a handle in the back so she couldcontrol the girl with it. The girl squeaked in choked surprise. She had probablynever been handled so roughly in her entire life. Nicci forced her ahead, towardthe building the woman had pointed out.Seeing how angry Nicci had suddenly become, no one followed. A woman not faroff, undoubtedly the girl’s mother, began to cry out in protest, but then fellsilent as Kardeef’s men turned their attention on her. By then Nicci already hadthe perplexed girl around the corner.Out back, drab laundry, deformed and crumpled from its ordeal on the washboard,and now stretched and pinned to lines, twisted in the wind as if struggling toescape. Smoke from the fire pit peeked over the top of the building. The nervouswoman waited with a large pair of shears.Nicci marched the girl up to a tub of water, drove her down on her knees, andshoved her head under the water. While the girl struggled, Nicci snatched thescissors from the woman. Her chore completed, the woman held her apron up overher mouth to muffle her wails as she ran off in tears, not wanting to watch achild being murdered.Nicci pulled the girl’s head up out of the water, and while she sputtered andgasped for air, began clipping her dark, soaking wet hair close to the scalp.When Nicci had finished cutting it off in sodden clumps, she dunked the girlagain while leaning over and scooping up a cake of pale yellow soap from thewashboard on the ground beside the tub. Nicci hauled the girl’s head up and thenbegan scrubbing. The girl screeched, flailing her spindly arms and clawing atthe strap around her neck by which Nicci controlled her. Nicci realized she wasprobably hurting her, but from within the grip of rage, it was only a dimrealization.“What’s the matter with you!” Nicci shook the gasping girl. “Don’t you knowyou’re crawling with lice?”“But, but-”The soap was harsh and as rough as a rasp. The girl squealed as Nicci bent herover and put more muscle into the scouring.“Do you like having a head full of lice?”“No--”“Well, you must! Why else would you have them?”“Please! I’ll try to do better. I’ll wash. I promise!”Nicci remembered how much she hated catching lice from the places her mothersent her. She remembered scrubbing herself, using the harshest soap she couldfind, only to again be sent off to another place, where she would get infestedwith the hated things all over again.When Nicci had scrubbed and dunked a dozen times, she finally dragged the girlto a tub of clean water and swished her head about in it to rinse her off. Thegirl blinked furiously, trying to clear her eyes of the stinging, soapy water asit streamed down off her face.Gripping the girl’s chin, Nicci peered into her red eyes. “No doubt your clothesare lousy with nits. You’re to scrub your clothes every day-underthings,especially-or the lice will just be right back.” Nicci squeezed the girl’scheeks until her eyes watered. “You are better than to be filthy with lice!Don’t you know that?”The girl nodded, as best as she could with Nicci’s strong fingers holding herface. The big, dark, intelligent eyes, although red from the water and wide withshock, were still filled with that rare sense of wonder. As painful andfrightening as the experience was, this had not dispelled it.“Burn your bedding. Get new.” Given the way these people lived and worked, itseemed a hopeless challenge. “Your whole family must burn their bedding. Washall their clothes.”The girl nodded her oath.Task completed, Nicci marched the girl back toward the gathered crowd. Forcingher along by the studded strap used as a collar, Nicci was unexpectedly struckby a memory.It was a memory of the first time she had seen Richard.Nearly every Sister at the Palace of the Prophets had been gathered in the greathall to see the new boy Sister Verna had brought in. Nicci lingered at themahogany rail, twining around her finger a lace dangling from her bodice, onlyto pull the lace straight and then to twine it again, when the pair of thickwalnut doors opened. The rumbling drone of conversation, sprinkled with brightlaughter, trailed to an expectant hush as the group, led by Sister Phoebe,marched into the chamber, past the white columns topped by gold capitals, and inunder the huge vaulted dome.The birth of gifted boys was rare, and a cause of expectant delight when theywere discovered and finally brought to live at the palace. A grand banquet wasplanned for that evening. Most of the Sisters, dressed in their finery, stood onthe floor below, eager to meet the new boy. Nicci remained near the center ofthe lower balcony. She didn’t care whether she met him or not.It came as something of a shock to see how Sister Verna had aged on her journey.Such journeys typically lasted at most a year; this one, beyond the greatbarrier to the New World, had taken nearly twenty. Events beyond the barrierbeing uncertain, Verna had apparently been sent off on her mission too far inadvance.Life at the Palace of the Prophets was as long as it was serene. No one at thePalace of the Prophets appeared to have aged at all in so trifling a span oftime as two decades, but away from the spell that enveloped the palace, Vernahad. Verna, probably close to one hundred and sixty years old, had to be atleast twenty years younger than Nicci; yet she now looked twice Nicci’s age.People outside the palace aged at the normal rate, of course, but to see ithappen so rapidly to a Sister . . .As the roaring applause thundered on in the huge room, many of the Sisters weptover the momentous occasion. Nicci yawned. Sister Phoebe held up her hand untilthe room fell silent.“Sisters.” Phoebe’s voice trembled. “Please welcome Sister Verna home.” Shefinally had to raise a hand to again bring the clamor of applause to a halt.When the room had quieted, she said, “And may I present our newest student, ournewest child of the Creator, our newest charge.” She turned and held an arm outin introduction, wiggling her fingers, urging the apparently timid boy forwardas she went on. “Please welcome Richard Cypher to the Palace of the Prophets.”Several of the women stepped back out of the way as he strode forward. Nicci’seyes widened; her back straightened. It was not a young boy. He was grown into aman.The crowd, despite their shock, clapped and cheered with the warmth of theirwelcome. Nicci didn’t hear it. Her attention was riveted by those gray eyes ofhis. He was introduced to some of the nearby Sisters. The novice assigned tohim, Pasha, was brought before him and tried to speak to him.Richard brushed Pasha aside, a stag dismissing a vole, and stepped out aloneinto the center of the room. His whole bearing conveyed the same quality Niccibeheld in his eyes.“I have something to say.”The vast chamber fell to an astonished hush.His gaze swept the room. Nicci’s breath caught when, for an instant, their eyesmet, as he probably met countless others.Her trembling fingers clutched the rail for support.Nicci swore at that moment to do whatever was necessary to be named as one ofhis teachers.His fingers tapped the Rada’Han around his neck.“As long as you keep this collar on me, you are my captors, and I am yourprisoner.”Murmurs hummed in the air. A Rada’Han was put around a boy’s neck not joust togovern him, but to protect him as well. The boys were never thought of asprisoners, but wards who needed security, care, and training. Richard, though,did not see it that way.“Since I have committed no aggression against you, that makes us enemies. We areat war.”Several older Sisters teetered on their heels, nearly fainting. The faces ofhalf the women in the room went red. The rest went white. Nicci could not haveimagined such an attitude. His demeanor kept her from blinking, lest sheoverlook something. She drew slow breaths, lest she miss a word. Her poundingheart, though, was beyond her ability to control.“Sister Verna has made a pledge to me that I will be taught to control the gift,and when I have learned what is required, I will be set free. For now, as longas you keep that pledge, we have a truce. But there are conditions.”Richard lifted a red leather rod hanging on a fine gold chain around his neck.At the time, Nicci hadn’t known it to be the weapon of a Mord-Sith.“I have been collared before. The person who put that collar on me brought mepain, to punish me, to teach me, to subdue me.”Nicci knew that such could be the only fate of one like him.“That is the sole purpose of a collar. You collar a beast. You collar yourenemies.”“I made her much the same offer I am making you. I begged her to release me. Shewould not. I was forced to kill her.“Not one of you could ever hope to be good enough to lick her boots. She did asshe did because she was tortured and broken, made mad enough to use a collar tohurt people. She did it against her nature.”“You . . .” His gaze swept all the eyes watching him. “You do it because youthink it is your right. You enslave in the name of your Creator. I don’t knowyour Creator. The only one beyond this world who I know would do as you do isthe Keeper.” The crowd gasped. “As far as I’m concerned, you may as well be theKeeper’s disciples.”Little did he know that some of them were.“If you do as she, and use this collar to bring me pain, the truce will beended. You may think you hold the leash to this collar, but I promise you, ifthe truce ends, you will find that what you hold is a bolt of lightning.”The room was as silent as a tomb.He was alone, defiant, in the midst of hundreds of sorceresses who knew how toharness every nuance of the power with which they were born; he knew next tonothing of his ability, and was collared by a Rada’Han besides. In this, he mayhave been a stag, but a stag challenging a congregation of lions. Hungry lions.Richard rolled up his left sleeve. He drew his sword-a sword!-in defiance of theprodigious power arrayed before him. The distinctive ring of steel filled thesilence as the blade was brought free.Nicci stood spellbound as he listed his conditions.He finally pointed back with the sword. “Sister Verna captured me. I have foughther every step of this journey. She has done everything short of killing me anddraping my body over a horse to get me here. Though she, too, is my captor andenemy, I owe her certain debts. If anyone lays a finger to her because of me, Iwill kill that person, and the truce will be ended.”Nicci couldn’t fathom such a strange sense of honor, but somehow she knew it fitwhat she saw in his eyes.The crowd gasped as Richard drew his sword across the inside of his arm. Heturned it, wiping both sides in the blood, until it dripped from the tip. Niccicould plainly see, even if the others could not much as she saw in his eyes aquality others did not see-that the sword united with, and completed, magicwithin him.His knuckles white around the hilt, he thrust the glistening crimson blade intothe air.“I give you a blood oath!” he cried out. “Harm the Baka Ban Mana, harm SisterVerna, or harm me, and the truce will be ended, and I promise you we will havewar! If we have war, I will lay waste to the Palace of the Prophets!”From the upper balcony, where Richard couldn’t see him, Jedidiah’s mocking voicedrifted out over the crowd. “All by yourself?”“Doubt me at your peril. I am a prisoner; I have nothing to live for. I am theflesh of prophecy. I am the bringer of death.”No answer came in the stupefied silence. Probably every woman in the room knewof the prophecy of the bringer of death, though none was certain of its intendedmeaning. The text of that prophecy, along with all the others, was kept in thevaults deep under the Palace of the Prophets. That Richard knew it, that hedared declare it aloud in such company, augured the worst possibleinterpretation. Every lioness in the room retracted her claws in caution.Richard drove his sword home into its scabbard as if to punctuate his threat.Nicci knew that the profound importance of what she had seen in his eyes and inhis presence would forever haunt her.She knew, too, that she must destroy him.Nicci had to surrender favors and commit to obligations she never imagined shewould have willingly done, but in return, she became one of Richard’s sixteachers. The burdens she had taken on in return for that privilege were allworth it when she sat alone with him, across a small table in his room, lightlyholding his hands-if one could be said to lightly grasp lightning-endeavoring toteach him to touch his Han, the essence of life and spirit within the gifted.Try as he might, he felt nothing. That, in itself, was peculiar. The inkling ofwhat she felt within him, though, was often enough to leave her unable to bringforth more than a few sparse words. She had casually questioned the others, andknew they were blind to it.Although Nicci could not comprehend what it was about his intellect that hiseyes and his conduct revealed, she did know that it disturbed the numb safety ofher indifference. She ached to grasp it before she had to destroy him, and atthe same time ached to destroy him before she did.Whenever she became confident that she was beginning to unravel the mystery ofhis singular character, and thought she could predict what he would do in agiven , situation, he would confound her by doing something completelyunexpected, if not impossible. Time and again he reduced to ashes what she hadthought was the foundation of her understanding of him. She spent hours sittingalone, in abysmal misery, because it seemed to be in plain sight, yet shecouldn’t define it. She knew only that it was some principle important beyondmeasure, and it remained beyond her .: grasp.Richard, never happy about his situation, became increasingly distant as timepassed. Forlorn of hope, Nicci decided that the time had come.When she went to his room for what she meant to be his final lesson and his end,he surprised her by offering her a rare white rose. Worse, he offered it with asmile and no explanation. As he held it out, she was so petrified that she couldonly manage to say, “Why, thank you, Richard.” The white roses were from onlyone kind of place: dangerous restricted areas no student should ever have beenable to enter. That he apparently could, and that he would so boldly offer herthe proof of his trespass, startled her. She held the white rose carefullybetween a finger and thumb, not knowing if he was warning her-by giving her aforbidden thing-that he was the bringer of death, and she was being marked, orif it was a gesture of simple, if strange, kindness. She erred on the side ofcaution. Once again, his nature had stayed her hand.The other Sisters of the Dark had plans of their own. Richard’s gift, as far asNicci was concerned, was probably the least remarkable and by far the leastimportant thing about him, yet Liliana, one of his other teachers, a woman ofboundless greed and limited insight, thought to steal the innate ability of hisHan for herself. It sparked a lethal confrontation which Liliana lost. The sixof them, their leader, Ulicia, and Richard’s five remaining teachers-having beendiscovered, escaped with their lives and little else, only to end up in Jagang’sclutches.In the end, Nicci understood that quality in his eyes no better than the firstmoment she had seen it.It had all slipped through her fingers.The girl ran for her mother when Nicci released her grip on the studded straparound her neck.“Well?” Commander Kardeef shrieked. He planted his fists on his hips. “Are youthrough with your games? It’s time these people learned the true meaning ofruthless!”Nicci stared into the depths of his dark eyes. They were defiant, angry, anddetermined-yet they were nothing at all like Richard’s eyes.Nicci turned to the soldiers.She gestured. “You two. Seize the commander.”The men blinked dumbly. Commander Kardeef’s face went red with rage. “That’s it!You’ve finally gone too far!” He wheeled to his men, a whole field of them-twothousand of them. He pointed a thumb back over his shoulder at Nicci. “Grab thislunatic witch!”Half a dozen men nearest to her drew weapons as they rushed her. Like all Orderfield troops, they were big, strong, and quick. They were also experienced.Nicci thrust a fist out in the direction of the closest as he lifted his whip tolash out and entangle her. With the speed of thought, both Additive Magic andSubtractive twined together in a lethal mix as she unleashed a focused bolt ofpower. It produced a burst of light so hot and so white that for an instant itmade the sunlight seem dim and cold by comparison.The blast blew a mellon-sized hole through the center of the soldier’s chest.For an instant, before the internal pressure forced his organs to fill thesudden void, she could see men behind through the gaping hole in his chest.The afterimage of the flare lingered in her mind’s eye like lightning’s arc. Theacrid smell of scorched air stung her eyes. The clap of her power’s thunderrumbled out across the surrounding green fields of wheat.Before the soldier hit the ground, Nicci unleased her power on three more of thecharging men, taking off one’s entire shoulder, the wallop whirling him aroundlike a ghastly fountain, the dangling limb flinging off into the crowd. A thirdman was cut almost in two. She felt the concussion of the following bolt deep inher chest and, amid a blinding flash, the fourth man’s head came apart in acloud of red mist and bony debris.Her warning gaze met the eyes of two men with knives gripped in white-knuckledfists. They halted. Many more took a step back as the four reports, to her soseparate yet so close atop one another that they almost merged into one rippingblast, still echoed off the buildings.“Now,” she said in a quiet, calm, composed voice that by its very gentlenessbetrayed how deadly earnest was the threat, “if you men do not follow my orders,and seize Commander Kardeef, I will seize him myself. But, of course, not untilafter I’ve killed every last one of you.”The only sound was the moan of wind between the buildings.“Do as I say, or die. I will not wait.”The big men, knowing her, made their decision in the instant they knew was allshe would grant them, and leaped to seize the commander. He managed to draw hissword. Kadar Kardeef was no stranger to pitched battle. He screamed orders as hefought them off. More than one man fell dead in the melee. Others cried out asthey took wounds. From behind, men finally caught the deadly sword arm.Additional men piled on the commander until they had him disarmed, down on theground, and finally under control.“What do you think you’re doing?” Kadar Kardeef roared at her as the men pulledhim to his feet.Nicci closed the distance between them. The soldiers held his arms twistedbehind his back. She stared into his wild eyes.“Why, Commander, I am merely following your orders.”“What are you talking about!”She smiled without humor just because she knew it would further madden him.One of the men glanced back over his shoulder. “What do you want done with him?”“Don’t hurt him-I want him fully conscious. Strip him and bind him to the pole.”“Pole? What pole?”“The pole that held the pigs you men ate.”Nicci snapped her fingers, and they began pulling off their commander’s clothes,She watched without emotion as he was finally stripped. His gear and prizedweapons became plunder, quickly disappearing into the hands of men he hadcommanded. They grunted with effort as they fought to bind the struggling,naked, hairy commander to the pole at his back.Nicci turned to the stunned crowd. “Commander Kardeef wishes you to know howruthless we can be. I am going to carry out those orders, and demonstrate it foryou.” She turned back to the soldiers. “Put him over the fire to roast like apig.”The soldiers bore the struggling, furious Kadar Kardeef, the hero of the LittleGap campaign, to the fire pit. They knew that Jagang watched them through hereyes. They had reason to be confident that the emperor would stop her if hewished to. After all, he was the dream walker, and they had seen him force herand the other Sisters to submit to his wishes countless times, no matter howdegrading those wishes were.They could not know that, for some reason, Jagang did not have access to hermind right then.The wooden ends of the pole clattered into the sockets in the stone supports toeach side of the fire pit. The pole sprang up and down with the weight of itsload The weight finally settled, leaving Kadar Kardeef to hang facedown. He hadlittle choice but to watch the glowing coals beneath him.Even though the fire had burned down, it wasn’t long before the heat of thewavering, low flames began causing him distress. As people watched in silentdismay, the commander twisted as he shrieked orders, demanding that his men takehim down, promising them punishment if they delayed. His diatribe trailed off ashe began gasping for control of his growing dread.Watching the eyes of the town’s people, Nicci pointed behind her.“This is how ruthless the Imperial Order is: they will slowly, painfully, burnto death a great commander, a war hero, a man known and revered far and wide, aman who has served them well, just to prove to you, the people of aninsignificant little town, that they will not hesitate to kill anyone. Our goalis the good of all, and that goal is held more important than any mere man amongus. This is the proof. Now, do you people, for any reason, still think that wewould shrink from harming any or all of you if you don’t contribute to thecommon good?”Nearly everyone shook their heads as they all mumbled, “No, Mistress.”Behind her, Commander Kardeef writhed in pain. He again yelled at his men,commanding them to bring him down, and to kill “the crazy witch.” None of thesoldiers moved to comply with his orders. To look at them, they didn’t even hearhim. These men had no notion of compassion. There was only life, and death. Theychose life; that choice required his death.Nicci stood watching the eyes of the people as the minutes dragged on. Thecommander was up a good distance from the low flames, but there was a expansivebed of broiling hot coals. She knew that, from time to time, the gusty breezediverted the fierce heat to give him a fleeting reprieve. It would only prolonghis ordeal; the heat was inexorable. Still, it would take some time. She didn’task for more firewood. She was in no hurry.People’s noses wrinkled; everyone could smell his body hair burning. No onedared speak. As the ordeal wore on, the skin across Kardeef’s chest and stomachreddened, and then darkened. It was a good fifteen minutes before it finallybegan to crack and split open. He shrieked in pain nearly the entire time. Thesmell turned to a surprisingly pleasant aroma of cooking meat.In the end, he gave in to wailing for mercy. He called her name, begging her tobring it to an end, to either free him or to finish him quickly. As she listenedto him sob her name, she stroked the gold ring through her lower lip, his voicelittle more to her than the buzzing of a fly.The thin layer of fat that lay over his powerful muscles began melting. He grewhoarse. Fueled by the fat, flames flared up, scorching his face.“Nicci!” Kardeef knew his pleas for mercy were falling on indifferent ears. Hebetrayed his true feelings. “You vicious bitch! You deserved everything I did toyour”She casually confronted his wild gaze. “Yes, I did. Give my regards to theKeeper, Kadar.”“Tell him yourself! When Jagang finds out about this, he’ll tear you limb fromlimb! You’ll soon be in the underworld, in the Keeper’s hands!”His words were once more but a trifling drone.Sweat beaded on people’s foreheads as the spectacle dragged on. They needed nospoken orders to know she expected them to remain and watch the whole thing.Their own imaginations, should they consider disobeying her unspoken orders,would dream up punishments she never could. Only the boys were fascinated by theremarkable exhibition. Knowing looks passed among them; torture such as this wasa treat to the minds of young immortals. Someday, they might make good Ordertroops-if they didn’t grow up.Nicci met the glare of the girl. The hatred in those eyes was breathtaking. Eventhough the girl had been afraid of the dunking and scrubbing, her eyes, at thetime, had shown that the world was still a wondrous place, and she was someonespecial. Now, her eyes betrayed her lost innocence.The whole time, Nicci stood tall, with her back straight and shoulders square,to take the full blow of the girl’s bright new hatred, feeling the raresensation of experiencing something.The girl had no idea that Commander Kardeef had taken her place in the flames,When the commander finally went silent, Nicci turned her eyes from the girl andspoke to the town’s people.“The past is gone. You are part of the Imperial Order. If you people don’t dothe moral thing by contributing toward the well-being of your fellow citizens ofthe Order, I will return.”They did not doubt her. If there was one thing they obviously wanted, it wasnever to see her again.One of the soldiers, his fists trembling at his sides, tramped forward inhalting steps. His eyes were wide with bewildered pain. “I want you back,darlin,” he growled in a voice that didn’t match the startled expression in hiseyes. The voice turned deadly. “And I want you back right now.”There was no mistaking Jagang’s voice, or the rage in it.It was difficult for him to control the mind of one without the gift. He had thesoldier in a tenacious grip. Jagang would not have used a soldier, therebybetraying his impotence, had he been able to reach in and control Nicci’s mind.She had absolutely no idea why he had suddenly lost the link to her. It hadhappened before. She knew he would eventually reestablish his ability to hurther. She had merely to wait.“You are angry with me, Excellency?”“What do you think?”She shrugged. “Since Kadar was your better in bed, I would think you would bepleased.”“Get yourself back here right now!” the soldier roared in Jagang’s voice. “Doyou understand? Right now!”Nicci bowed. “But, of course, Excellency.”As she straightened, she yanked the soldier’s long knife from the sheath at hisbelt and slammed it hilt-deep into his muscled gut. She `gritted her teeth withthe effort of pivoting the handle sideways, sweeping the blade in a lethal arcthrough his insides.She doubted the man felt his messy death writhing at her feet while she waitedfor her carriage to make its way around the square. He died with Jagang’schuckle on his lips. Since a dream walker could only be in a living mind, forthe time being, the afternoon returned to quiet.After her carriage rocked to a dusty halt, a soldier reached up and opened thedoor. She leaned out from the step, turning back to the crowd, holding theoutside handrail in order to stand straight so that they all might see her. Herblond hair fluttered in the sunny breeze.“Do not forget this day, and how your lives were all spared by Jagang the Just!The commander would have murdered you; the emperor, through me, has insteadshown his compassion. Spread the word of the mercy and wisdom of Jagang theJust, and I will have no need to return.”The crowd mumbled that they would.“Do you want us to bring the commander with us,” a soldier asked. The man, KadarKardeef’s loyal second, now wore Kardeef’s sword. Like vegetables, fidelity’sfresh vitality was fleeting, its final fate stench and rot.“Leave him to roast as a reminder. Everyone else will return with me toFairfield.”“By your command,” he said with a bow. He circled his arm and ordered the men tomount up and move out.Nicci leaned out farther and looked up at the driver. “His Excellency wishes tosee me. Although he has not said as much, I’m reasonably sure he would like youto hurry.”Nicci took her place on the hard leather cushion inside, her back straightagainst the upright seat, while the driver let out a shrill whistle and crackedhis whip. The team leaped forward, jerking the carriage ahead. With a hand onthe windowsill, she steadied herself as the ironbound wheels bounced over thehard, rough ground of the town square until they reached the road, where thecarnage settled down into this familiar jolting ride. Sunlight slanted in thewindow, falling across the empty cushion opposite her. The bold bright patchglided off the seat as the carriage negotiated a curve in the road, finallyslipping up to come to rest in her lap like a warm cat. Darkly clad riders toeach side, ahead, and behind stretched forward over the withers of theirgalloping mounts. A rumbling roar along with billowing plumes of dust liftedinto the air from the thundering hooves.For the moment, Nicci was free of Jagang. She was surrounded by two thousandmen, yet she felt totally alone. Before long, she would have pain to fill theterrible void.She felt no joy, no fear. She sometimes wondered why she felt nothing but theneed to hurt.As the carriage raced toward Jagang, her thoughts were focused instead onanother man, trying to recall every occasion that she had seen him. She wentover every moment she had spent with Richard Cypher, or as he was now known-andas Jagang knew him-Richard Rahl.She thought about his gray eyes.Until the day she saw him, she had never believed such a person could exist.When she thought about Richard, like now, only one haunting need burned in her:to destroy him."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9Huge garish tents festooned the prominent hill outside the city of Fairfield,yet despite the festive colors erected amid the gloom, despite the laughing, theshouting, the coarse singing, and the riotous excess, this was no carnival cometo town, but an occupying army. The emperor’s tents, and those of his retinue,were styled in the fashion of the tents used by some of the nomadic people fromJagang’s homeland of Altur’Rang, yet they were embellished far beyond any actualtradition. The emperor, a man vastly exceeding any nomadic tribal leader’sability to imagine, created his own cultural heritage as he saw fit.Around the tents, covering the hills and valleys as far as Nicci could see, thesoldiers had pitched their own small grimy tents. Some were oiled canvas, manymore were made from animal skins. Beyond the shared basics of practicality,there was uniformity only in their lack of conformity to any one style.Outside some of the shabby little tents, and almost as large, sat ornateupholstered chairs looted from the city. The juxtaposition almost looked as ifit had been intentionally done for a comical effect, but Nicci knew the realityhad no kinship to humor. When the army eventually moved on, such large,meticulously crafted items were too cumbersome to take and would be left to rotin the weather.Horses were picketed haphazardly, with occasional paddocks holding small herds.Other enclosures held meat on the hoof. Individual wagons were scattered hereand there, seemingly wherever they could find an empty spot, but in other placesthey had been set up side by side. Many were camp followers, others were armywagons with everything from basic supplies to blacksmith equipment. The armybrought along minimal siege equipment; they had the gifted to use as weapons ofthat sort.Brooding clouds scudded low over the scene. The humid air reeked of excrementfrom both animals and men. The green fields all around had been churned to amuddy morass. The two thousand men who had returned with Nicci had disappearedinto the sprawling camp like a sprinkling of raindrops into a swamp.An Imperial Order army encampment was a place of noise and seeming confusion,yet it was not as disorderly as it might appear. There was a hierarchy ofauthority, and duties and chores to attend. Scattered men worked in solitude ontheir gear, oiling weapons and leather or rolling their chain mail insidebarrels with sand and vinegar to clean it of rust, while others cooked at fires.Furriers saw to the horses. Craftsmen saw to everything from repairing weaponsto fashioning new boots to pulling teeth. Mystics of all sorts prowled the camp,tending impoverished souls or warding troublesome demons. Duties completed,raucous gangs gathered together for entertainment, usually gambling anddrinking. Sometimes the diversions involved the camp followers, sometimes thecaptives.Even surrounded by such vast numbers, Nicci felt alone. Jagang’s absence fromher mind left a feeling of staggering isolation-not a sense of being forsaken,but simply solitude by contrast. With the dream walker in her mind, not even themost intimate detail of life-no thought, no deed-could be held private. Hispresence lurked in the dark mental corners, and from there he could watcheverything: every word you spoke; every thought you had; every bite you took;every time you cleared your throat; every time you coughed; every time you wentto the privy. You were never alone. Never. The violation was debilitating, thetrespass complete.That was what broke most of the Sisters: the brutal totality of it, theawareness of his constant presence in your own mind, watching. Worse, almost,the dream walker’s roots sunk down through you, but you never knew when hisawareness was focused on you. You might call him a vile name, and, with hisattention elsewhere, it would go unnoticed. Another time, you might have abrief, private, nasty thought about him, and he would know it the same instantyou thought it.Nicci had learned to feel those roots, as had many of the other Sisters. She hadalso learned to recognize when they were absent, as now. That never happenedwith the others; with them, those roots were permanent. Jagang always eventuallyreturned, though, to once again sink his roots into her, but for now, she wasalone. She just didn’t know why.The jumble of troops and campfires left no clear route for the team, so Niccihad left her carriage for the walk the rest of the way up the hill. It exposedher to the lecherous looks and lewd calls of the soldiers who crowded the slope.She supposed that before Jagang was finished with her, she might be exposed tofar more from the men. Most of the Sisters were sent out to the tents from timeto time to be used for the men’s pleasure. It was done either to punish them or,sometimes, merely to let them know it could be ordered on a whim-to remind themthat they were slaves, nothing more than property.Nicci, though, was reserved for the exclusive amusement of the emperor and thosehe specifically selected-like Kadar Kardeef. Many of the Sisters envied herstatus, but despite what they believed, being a personal slave to Jagang was nograce. Women were sent to the tents for a period of time, maybe a week or two,but the rest of the time they had less demanding duties. They were valued, afterall, for their abilities with their gift. There was no such time limit forNicci. She had once spent a couple of months sequestered in Jagang’s room, so asto be there for his amusement any time of day or night. The soldiers enjoyed thewomen’s company, but had to mind certain restrictions in what they could do tothem; Jagang and his friends imposed on themselves no such limits.On occasion, for reason or not, Jagang would become furious at her and wouldheatedly order her to the tents for a month-to teach her a lesson, he would say.Nicci would obediently bow and pledge it would be as he wished. He knew she wasnot bluffing; it would have been a lesser torment. Before she could be out thedoor to the tents, he would turn moody, command her to return to face him, andthen angrily retract the orders.Since the beginning, Nicci had, measure by measure, inch by inch, acquired acertain status and freedom afforded none of the others. She hadn’t specificallysought it; it just came about. Jagang had confided to her that he read theSisters’ thoughts, and that they privately referred to her as the Slave Queen.She supposed Jagang told her so as to honor her in his own way, but the title“Slave Queen” had meant no more to her than “Death’s Mistress.”For now, she floated like a bright water-lily flower in the dark swamp of men.Other Sisters always made an attempt to look as drab as the men so as to go lessnoticed and be less desirable. They only deceived themselves. They lived inconstant terror of what Jagang might do to them. What happened, happened. Theyhad no choice or influence in it.Nicci simply didn’t care. She wore her fine black dresses and left her longblond hair uncovered for all to see. For the most part, she did as she wished.She didn’t care what Jagang did to her, and he knew it. In much the way Richardwas an enigma to her, she was an enigma to Jagang.Too, Jagang was fascinated by her. Despite his cruelty toward her, there was aspark of caution mixed in. When he hurt her, she welcomed it; she merited thebrutality. Pain could sometimes reach down into the dark emptiness. He wouldthen recoil from hurting her. When he threatened to kill her, she waitedpatiently for it to be done; she knew she didn’t deserve to live. He would thenwithdraw the sentence of death.The fact that she was sincere was her safety-and her peril. She was a fawn amongwolves, safe in her coat of indifference. The fawn was in danger only if it ran.She did not view her captivity as a conflict with her interests; she had nointerests. Time and again she had the opportunity to run, but didn’t. That,perhaps more than anything, captivated Jagang.Sometimes, he seemed to pay court to her. She didn’t know his real interest inher; she never tried to discover it. He occasionally professed concern for her,and a few times, something akin to affection. Other times, when she left on someduty, he seemed glad to be rid of her.It had occurred to her, because of his behavior, that he might think he was inlove with her. As preposterous as such a thought might be, it didn’t matter oneway or the other to her. She doubted he was capable of love. She seriouslydoubted that Jagang really knew what the word meant, much less the entireconcept.Nicci knew all too well what it meant.A soldier near Jagang’s tent stepped in front of her. He grinned moronically; itwas meant to be an invitation by means of threat. She could have dissuaded himby mentioning that Jagang waited for her, or she could even have used her powerto drop him where he stood, but instead she simply stared at him. It was not thereaction he wanted. Many of the men rose to the bait only if it squirmed. Whenshe didn’t, his expression turned sour. He grumbled a curse at her and movedoff.Nicci continued on toward the emperor’s tent. Nomadic tents from Altur’Rang wereactually quite small and practical, being made of bland, unadorned lambskin,Jagang had re-created them rather more grandly than the originals. His own wasmore oval than round. Three poles, rather than the customary one, held up themultipeaked roof. The tent’s exterior walls were decorated with brightlyembroidered panels. Around the top edge of the sides, where the roof met thewalls, hung fistsized multicolored tassels and streamers that marked thetraveling palace of the emperor. Banners and pennants of bright yellow and redatop the huge tent hung limp in the stale, late-afternoon air.Outside, a woman beat small rugs hung over one of the tent’s lines. Nicci liftedaside the heavy doorway curtain embellished with gold shields and hammeredsilver medallions depicting battle scenes. Inside, slaves were at work sweepingthe expanse of carpets, dusting the delicate ceramic ware set about on theelaborate furnishings, and fussing at the hundreds of colorful pillows liningthe edge of the floor. Hangings richly decorated with traditional Altur’Rangdesigns divided the space into several rooms. A few openings overhead coveredwith gauzy material let in a little light. All the thick materials created aquiet place amid the noise. Lamps and candles lent sleepy light to the softroom.Nicci did not acknowledge the eyes of the guards flanking the inside of thedoorway, or those of the other slaves going about their domestic duties. In themiddle of the front room sat Jagang’s ornate chair, draped with red silks. Thiswas where he sometimes took audiences, but the chair was empty. She didn’tfalter, as did other women summoned by His Excellency, but strode resolutelytoward his bedroom in the rear section.One of the slaves, a nearly naked boy looking to be in his late teens, was downon his hands and knees with a small whiskbroom sweeping the carpet set beforethe entrance to the bedroom. Without meeting Nicci’s gaze, he informed her thatHis Excellency was not occupying his tents. The young man, Irwin, was gifted. Hehad lived at the Palace of the Prophets, training to be a wizard. Now Irwintended the fringe of carpets and emptied the chamber pots. Nicci’s mother wouldhave approved.Jagang could be any number of places. He might be off gambling or drinking withhis men. He could be inspecting his troops or the craftsmen who attended them.He might be looking over the new captives, selecting those he wanted forhimself. He might be talking with Kadar Kardeef’s second.Nicci saw several Sisters cowering in a corner. Like her, they, too, wereJagang’s slaves. As she strode up to the three women, she saw that they werebusy sewing, mending some of the tent’s gear.“Sister Nicci!” Sister Georgia rushed to her feet as a look of relief washedacross her face. “We didn’t know if you were alive or dead. We haven’t seen youfor so long. We thought maybe you had vanished.”Being that Nicci was a Sister of the Dark, sworn to the Keeper of theunderworld, she found the concern from three Sisters of the Light to be somewhatinsincere. Nicci supposed that they considered their captivity a common bond,and their feelings about it paramount, overcoming their more basic rifts. Too,they knew Jagang treated her differently; they were probably eager to be seen asfriendly.“I’ve been away on business for His Excellency.”“Of course,” Sister Georgia said, dry-washing her hands as she dipped her head.The other two, Sisters Rochelle and Aubrey, set aside the bag of bone buttonsand tent thread, untangled themselves from yards of canvas, and then stoodbeside Sister Georgia. They both bowed their heads slightly to Nicci. The threeof them feared her inscrutable standing with Jagang.“Sister Nicci . . . His Excellency is very angry,” Sister Rochelle said.“Furious,” Sister Aubrey confirmed. “He . . . he railed at the walls, sayingthat you had gone too far this time.”Nicci only stared.Sister Aubrey licked her lips. “We just thought you should know. So you can becareful.”Nicci thought this would be a poor time to suddenly begin being careful. Shefound the groveling of women hundreds of years her senior annoying. “Where’sJagang?”“He has taken a grand building, not far outside the city, as his quarters,”Sister Aubrey said.“It used to be the Minister of Culture’s estate,” Sister Rochelle added.Nicci frowned. “Why? He has his tents.”“Since you’ve been gone, he’s decided that an emperor needs proper quarters,”Sister Rochelle said.“Proper? Proper for what?”“To show the world his importance, I suppose.”Sister Aubrey nodded. “He’s having a palace built. In Altur’Rang. It’s his newvision.” She arced an arm through the air, apparently indicating, with the sliceof her hand, the grand scale of the place. “He’s ordered a magnificent palacebuilt.”“He was planning on using the Palace of the Prophets,” Sister Rochelle said,“but since it was destroyed he’s decided to build another, only better-the mostopulent palace ever conceived.”Nicci frowned at the three women. “He wanted the Palace of the Prophets becauseit had a spell to slow aging. That was what interested him.”All three women shrugged.Nicci began to get an inkling of what Jagang might have in mind. “So, this placehe’s at now? What is he doing? Learning to eat with something other than hisfingers? Seeing how he likes living the fancy life under a roof?”“He only told us he was staying there for now,” Sister Georgia said. “He tookmost of the . . . younger women with him. He told us to stay here and see tothings in case he wished to return to his tent.”It didn’t sound like much had changed, except the setting.Nicci sighed. Her carriage was gone. She would have to walk.“All right. How do I find the place?”After Sister Aubrey gave her detailed directions, Nicci thanked them and turnedto go.“Sister Alessandra has vanished,” Sister Georgia said in a voice strainingmightily to sound nonchalant.Nicci stopped in her tracks.She rounded on Sister Georgia. The woman was middle aged, and seemed to lookworse every time Nicci saw her. Her clothes were little more than tattered ragsshe wore with the pride of a fine uniform. Her thin hair was more white thanbrown. It might once have looked distinguished, but it didn’t appear to haveseen a brush, much less soap, for weeks. She was probably infested with lice,too.Some people looked forward to age as an excuse to become a frump, as if allalong their greatest ambition in life had been to be drab and unattractive.Sister Georgia seemed to delight in dowdiness.“What do you mean, Sister Alessandra has vanished?”Nicci caught the slight twitch of satisfaction. Georgia spread her handsinnocently. “We don’t know what happened. She’s just turned up missing.”Still, Nicci did not move. “I see.”Sister Georgia spread her hands again, feigning simplemindedness. “It was aboutthe time the Prelate disappeared, too.”Nicci denied them the reward of astonishment.“What was Verna doing here?”“Not Verna,” Sister Rochelle said. She leaned in. “Ann.”Sister Georgia scowled her displeasure at Rochelle for spoiling the surprise-anda surprise it was. The old Prelate had died-at least, that was what Nicci hadbeen told. Since leaving the Place of the Prophets, Nicci had heard about allthe other Sisters, novices, and young men spending the night at the funeral pyrefor Ann and the prophet, Nathan. Knowing Ann, there was obviously some sort ofdeception afoot, but even for her, such a thing would be extraordinary.The three Sisters smiled like cats with a carp. They looked eager for a longgame of truth-and-gossip.“Give me the important details. I don’t have time for the long version. HisExcellency wishes to see me.” Nicci took in the three wilting smiles. She kepther voice level. “Unless you want to risk him returning here, angry andimpatient to see me.”Sisters Rochelle and Aubrey blanched.Georgia abandoned the game and went back to dry washing her hands. “The Prelatecame to the camp when you were gone-and was captured.”“Why would she come into Jagang’s midst?”“To try to convince us to escape with her,” Sister Rochelle blurted out. Ashrill titter jittery, rather than amused-burbled up. “She had some silly storyabout the chimes being loose and magic failing. Imagine that! Wild stories, theywere. Expected us to believe-”“So that was what happened . . .” Nicci whispered as she stared off inreflection. She realized instantly it was no wild story. Pieces began fittingtogether. Nicci used her gift, the others weren’t allowed to, so they might notknow if magic had failed for a time.“That’s what she claimed,” Sister Georgia said.“So, magic had failed,” Nicci reasoned aloud, “and she thought that wouldprevent the dream walker from controlling your minds.”That might explain much of what Nicci didn’t understand: why Jagang sometimescouldn’t enter her mind.“But if the chimes are loose-”“Were,” Sister Georgia said. “Even if it was true, for a time, they now havebeen banished. His Excellency has full access to us, I’m happy to say, andeverything else concerning magic has returned to normal.”Nicci could almost see the three of them wondering if Jagang was listening totheir words. But if magic was returned to normal, Jagang should be in Nicci’smind; he wasn’t. She felt the spark of a possible understanding fizzle and die.“So, the Prelate made a blunder and Jagang caught her.”“Well . . . not exactly,” Sister Rochelle said. “Sister Georgia went and got theguards. We turned her in, as was our duty.”Nicci burst out with a laugh. “Her own Sisters of the Light? How ironic! Sherisks her life, while the chimes have interrupted magic, to come and save yourworthless hides, and instead of escaping with her, you turn her in. Howfitting.”“We had to!” Sister Georgia protested. “His Excellency would have wished it. Ourplace is to serve. We know better than to try to escape. We know our place.”Nicci surveyed their tense faces, these women sworn to the Creator’s light,these Sisters of the Light who had worked hundreds of years in His name. “Yes,you do.”“You’d have done the same,” Sister Aubrey snapped. “We had to, or His Excellencywould have taken it out on the others. It was our duty to the welfare of theothers-and that includes you, I might add. We couldn’t think only of ourselves,or Ann, but had to think of what was good for everyone.”Nicci felt the numb indifference smothering her. “Fine, so you betrayed thePrelate.” Only a spark of curiosity remained. “But what made her think she couldescape with you for good? Surely, she must have had some plan for the chimes.What was she expecting to happen when Jagang once again had access to yourminds?-and hers?”“His Excellency is always with us,” Sister Aubrey insisted. “Ann was just tryingto fill our heads with her preposterous notions. We know better. The rest of itwas just a trick, too. We were too smart for her.”“Rest of it? What was the rest of her plan?”Sister Georgia huffed her indignation. “She tried to tell us some foolishnessabout a bond to Richard Rahl.”Nicci blinked. She concentrated on keeping her breathing even. “Bond? Whatnonsense are you talking about, now?”Sister Georgia met Nicci’s gaze squarely. “She insisted that if we sworeallegiance to Richard, it would protect us. She claimed some magic of his wouldkeep Jagang from our mind.”“How?”Sister Georgia shrugged. “She claimed this bond business protected people’sminds from dream walkers. But we aren’t that gullible.”To still her fingers, Nicci pressed her hands to her thighs. “I don’tunderstand. How would such a thing work?”“She said something about it being inherited from his ancestor. She claimed thatwe had but to swear loyalty to him, loyalty in our hearts-or some such nonsense.To tell the truth, it was so preposterous I wasn’t really paying that muchattention. She claimed that was why Jagang couldn’t enter her mind.”Nicci was staggered. Of course . . .She had always wondered why Jagang didn’t capture the rest of the Sisters. Therewere many more still free. They were protected by this bond to Richard. It hadto be true. It made sense. Her own leader, sister Ulicia, and Richard’s otherteachers had escaped, too. But that didn’t seem to make sense; they were Sistersof the Dark-like Nicci-they would have had to swear loyalty to Richard. Niccicouldn’t imagine such a thing.But then, Jagang was often unable to enter Nicci’s mind.“You said Sister Alessandra has vanished.”Sister Georgia fussed with the collar of her scruffy dress. “She and Ann bothvanished.”“Jagang doesn’t bother to inform you of his actions. Perhaps he simply had themput to death.”Georgia glanced at her companions. “Well . . . maybe. But Sister Alessandra wasone of yours . . . a Sister of the Dark. She was caring for Ann-”“Why weren’t you caring for her? You are her Sisters.”Sister Georgia cleared her throat. “She threw such a fit about us that HisExcellency assigned Sister Alessandra to look after her.”Nicci could only imagine that it must have been quite a fit. But after beingbetrayed by her own Sisters, it was understandable. Jagang would have thoughtthe woman valuable enough that he wanted to keep her alive.“As we marched into the city, the wagon with Ann’s cage never showed up,” SisterGeorgia went on. “One of the drivers finally came around with a bloody head andreported that the last thing he saw before the world went dark was SisterAlessandra. Now the two of them are gone.”Nicci felt her fingernails digging into her palms. She made herself relax herfists. “So, Ann offered you all freedom, and you chose instead to continue to beslaves.”The three women lifted their noses. “We did what is best for everyone,” SisterGeorgia said. “We are Sisters of the Light. Our duty is not to ourselves, but torelieve the suffering of others-not cause it.”“Besides,” Sister Aubrey added, “we don’t see you leaving. Seems you’ve beenfree of His Excellency from time to time, and you don’t go.”Nicci frowned. “How do you know that?”“Well, I, I mean. . .” Sister Aubrey stammered.Nicci seized the woman by the throat. “I asked you a question. Answer it.”Sister Aubrey’s face reddened as Nicci added the force of her gift to the grip.The tendons in her wrist stood out with the strain. The woman’s eyes showedwhite all around as Nicci’s power began squeezing the life from her. UnlikeNicci, Jagang possessed their minds, and they were prohibited from using theirpower except at his direction.Sister Georgia gently placed a hand on Nicci’s forearm. “His Excellencyquestioned us about it, that’s all, Sister. Let her go. Please?”Nicci released the woman but turned her glare on Sister Georgia. “Questionedyou? What do you mean? What did he say?”“He simply wanted to know if we knew why he was from time to time blocked fromyour mind.”“He hurt us,” Sister Rochelle said. “He hurt us with his questions, because wehad no answer. We don’t understand it.”For the first time, Nicci did.Sister Aubrey comforted her throat. “What is it with you, Sister Nicci? Why isit His Excellency is so curious about you? Why is it you can resist him?”Nicci turned and walked away. “Thank you for the help, Sisters.”“If you can be free of him, why do you not leave?” Sister Georgia called out.Nicci turned back from the doorway. “I enjoy seeing Jagang torment you Witchesof the Light. I stay around so that I might watch.”They were unmoved by her insolence-they were accustomed to it.“Sister Nicci,” Rochelle said, smoothing back her frizz of hair. “What did youdo that made His Excellency so angry?”“What? Oh, that. Nothing of importance. I just had the men tie Commander Kardeefto a pole and roast him over a fire.”The three of them gasped as they straightened as one. They reminded Nicci ofthree owls on a branch.Sister Georgia fixed Nicci with a grim glare, a rare blaze of authority born ofseniority.“You deserve everything Jagang does to you, Sister-and what the Keeper will doto you, too.”Nicci smiled and said, “Yes, I do,” before ducking through the tent opening."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10The city of Fairfield had returned to a semblance of order. It was the order ofa military post. Little of what could be said to make a city was left. Many ofthe buildings remained, but there were few of the people who had once lived andworked in them. Some of the buildings had been reduced to charred beams andblackened rubble, others were hulks with windows and doors broken out, yet mostwere much the same as they had been before, except, of course, that all had beenemptied in the wanton looting. The buildings stood like husks, only a reminderof past life.Here and there, a few toothless old people sat, legs splayed, leaning against awall, watching with empty eyes the masses of armed men moving up and down theirstreets. Orphaned children wandered in a daze, or peered out from darkpassageways. Nicci found it remarkable how quickly civilization could bestripped from a place.As she walked through the streets, Nicci thought she understood how many of thebuildings would feel if they could feel: empty, devoid of life, lacking purposewhile they waited for someone to serve; their only true value being in serviceto the living.The streets, populated as they were by grim-faced soldiers, gaunt beggars, theskeletal old and sick, wailing children, all amongst the rubble and filth,looked much like some of the streets Nicci remembered from when she was little.Her mother often sent her out to streets like this to minister to the destitute.“It’s the fault of men like your father,” her mother had said. “He’s just likemy father was. He has no feelings, no concern for anyone but himself. He’sheartless.”Nicci had stood, wearing a freshly washed, frilly blue dress, her hair brushedand pinned back, her hands hanging at her sides, listening as her motherlectured on good and evil, on the ways of sin and redemption. Nicci hadn’tunderstood a lot of it, but in later years it would be repeated until she wouldcome to know every word, every concept, every desolate truth by heart.Nicci’s father was wealthy. Worse, to Mother’s way of thinking, he wasn’tmorseful about it. Mother explained that self-interest and greed were like theeyes of a monstrous evil, always looking for yet more power and gold to feed itsinsatiable hunger.“You must learn, Nicci, that a person’s moral course in this life is to helpothers not yourself,” Mother said. “Money can’t buy the Creator’s blessing.”“But how can we show the Creator we’re good?” Nicci asked.“Mankind is a wretched lot, unworthy, morbid, and foul. We must fight depravednature. Helping others is the only way to prove your soul’s value. It’s onlytrue good a person can do.”Nicci’s father had been born a noble, but all his adult life he had worked asarmorer. Mother believed that he had been born with comfortable wealth, andinstead of being satisfied with that, he sought to build his legacy into ashameless fortune. She said wealth could only be had by fleecing it from thepoor in one fashion or another. Others of the nobility, like Mother and many ofher friends, were content not to squeeze an undeserved share from the sweat ofthe poor.Nicci felt great guilt for Father’s wicked ways, for his ill-gotten wealth.Mother said she was doing her best to try to save his straying soul. Nicci neverworried for her mother’s soul, because people were always saying how caring, howkindhearted, how charitable Mother was, but Nicci would sometimes lie awake atnight, unable to sleep with worry for Father, worry that the Creator might exactpunishment before Father could be redeemed.While Mother went to meetings with her important friends, the nanny, on the wayto the market, often took Nicci to Father’s business to ask his wishes fordinner. Nicci relished watching and learning things at Father’s work. It was afascinating place. When she was very young, she thought she might grow up to bean armorer, too. At home, she would sit on the floor and play at hammering on anitem of clothing meant to be armor laid on an upturned shoe used as an anvil.That innocent time was her fondest memory of her childhood.Nicci’s father had a great many people working for him. Wagons broughtfoursquare bars and other supplies from distant places. Heavy cast-metal sowscame in on barges. Other wagons, with guards, took goods to far-off customers.There were men who forged metal, men who hammered it into shape, and yet othermen who shaped glowing metal into weapons. Some of the blades were made fromcostly “poison steel,” said to inflict mortal wounds, even in a small cut. Therewere other men who sharpened blades, men who polished armor, and men who didbeautiful engraving and artwork on shields, armor, and blades. There were evenwomen who worked for Nicci’s father, helping to make chain mail. Nicci watchedthem, sitting on benches at long wooden tables, gossiping a bit amongthemselves, tittering at stories, as they worked with their pincers burring overtiny rivets in the flattened ends of all those thousands of little steel ringsthat together went into the making of a suit of chain-mail armor. Nicci thoughtit remarkable that man’s inventiveness could turn something as hard as metalinto a suit of clothes.Men from all around, and from distant places, too, came to buy her father’sarmor. Father said it was the finest armor made. His eyes, the color of the bluesky on a perfect summer day, sparkled wonderfully when he spoke of his armor.Some was so beautiful that kings traveled from great distances to have armorordered and fitted. Some was so elaborate that it took skilled men hunched atbenches many months to make.Blacksmiths, bellowsmen, hammermen, millmen, platers, armorers, polishers,leatherworkers, riveters, patternmakers, silversmiths, guilders, engravingartists, even seamstresses for the making of the quilted and padded linen, and,of course, apprentices, came from great distances, hoping to work for herfather. Many of those with skills lugged along samples of their best work toshow him. Father turned away far more than he hired.Nicci’s father was an impressive figure, upright, angular, and intense. At hiswork, his blue eyes always seemed to Nicci to see more than any other personsaw, as if the metal spoke to him when his fingers glided over it. He seemed tomove his limbs precisely as much as was needed, and no more. To Nicci, he was avision of power, strength, and purpose.Officers, officials, and nobility came round to talk to him, as did suppliers,and his workers. When Nicci went to her father’s work, she was always astonishedto see him engaged in so much conversation. Mother said it was because he wasarrogant, and made his poor workers pay court to him.Nicci liked to watch the intricate dance of people working. The workers wouldpause to smile at her, answer her questions, and sometimes let her hit the metalwith a hammer. From the looks of it, Father enjoyed talking to all those people,too. At home, Mother talked, and Father said little, as his face took on thelook of hammered steel.When he did talk at home, he spoke almost exclusively about his work. Niccilistened to every word, wanting to learn all about him and his business. Motherconfided that at his core his vile nature ate away at his invisible soul. Niccialways hoped to someday redeem his soul and make it as healthy as he outwardlyappeared.He adored Nicci, but seemed to think raising her was a task too sacred for hiscoarse hands, so he left it to Mother. Even when he disagreed with something, hewould bow to Mother’s wishes, saying she would know best about such a domesticduty.His work kept him busy most of the time. Mother said it was a sign of his barrensoul that he spent so much of his time at building his riches-taking frompeople, she often called it-rather than giving of himself to people, as theCreator meant all men to do. Many times, when Father came home for dinner, whileservants scurried in and out with all the dishes they’d prepared, Mother wouldgo on, in tortured tones, about how bad things were in the world. Nicci oftenheard people say that Mother was a noble woman because of how deeply she cared.After dinner Father would go back to work, often without a word. That wouldanger Mother, because she had more to tell him about his soul, but he was toobusy to listen.Nicci remembered occasions when Mother would stand at the window, looking outover the dark city, worrying, no doubt, about all the things that plagued herpeace. On those quiet nights, Father sometimes glided up behind Mother, puttinga hand tenderly to her back, as if she were something of great value. He seemedto be mellow and contented at those moments. He squeezed her bottom just alittle as he whispered something in her ear.She would look up hopefully and ask him to contribute to the efforts of herfellowship. He would ask how much. Peering up into his eyes as if searching forsome shred of human decency, she would name a figure. He would sigh and agree,His hands would settle around her waist, and he would say that it was late, andthat they should retire to bed.Once, when he asked her how much she wished him to contribute, she shrugged andsaid, “I don’t know. What does your conscience tell you, Howard? But, a man oftrue compassion would do better than you usually do, considering that you havemore than your fair share of wealth, and the need is so great.”He sighed. “How much do you and your friends need?”“It is not me and my friends who need it, Howard, but the masses of humanitycrying out for help. Our fellowship simply struggles to meet the need.”“How much?” he repeated.She said, “Five hundred gold crowns,” as if the number were a club she had beenhiding behind her back, and, seeing the opening she had been waiting for, shesuddenly brandished it to bully him.With a gasp, Father staggered back a step. “Do you have any idea of the workrequired to make a sum of that size?”“You do no work, Howard-your slaves do it for you.”“Slaves! They are the finest craftsmen!”“They should be. You steal the best workers from all over the land.”“I pay the best wages in the land! They are eager to work for me!”“They are the poor victims of your tricks. You exploit them. You charge morethan anyone else. You have connections and make deals to cut out other armorers.You steal the food from the mouths of working people, just to line your ownpockets.”“I offer the finest work! People buy from me because they want the best. Icharge a fair price for it.”“No one charges as much as you and that’s the simple fact. You always want more.Gold is your only goal.”“People come to me willingly because I have the highest standards. That is mygoal! The other shops produce haphazard work that doesn’t proof out. Mytempering is superior. My work is all proofed to a double-stamp standard. Iwon’t sell inferior work. People trust me; they know I create the best pieces.”“Your workers do. You simply rake in the money.”“The profits go to wages and to the business-I just sank a fortune into the newbattering-mill!”“Business, business, business! When I ask you to give a little something back tothe community, to those in need, you act as if I wanted you to gouge out youreyes. Would you really rather see people die than to give a pittance to savethem? Does money really mean more to you, Howard, than people’s lives? Are youthat cruel and unfeeling a man?”Father hung his head for a time, and at last quietly agreed to send his manaround with the gold. His voice came gentle again. He said he didn’t want peopleto die, and he hoped the money would help. He told her it was time for bed.“You’ve put me off, Howard, with your arguing. You couldn’t just give charitablyof yourself; it always has to be dragged out of you-when it’s the right thing todo in the first place. You only agree now because of your lecherous needs.Honestly, do you think I have no principles?”Father simply turned and headed for the door. He paused as he suddenly saw Niccisitting on the floor, watching. The look on his face frightened her, not becauseit was angry, or fierce, but because there seemed to be so much in his eyes, andthe weight of never being able to express it was crushing him. Raising Nicci wasMother’s work, and he had promised her he would not meddle.He swept his blond hair back from his forehead, then turned and picked up hiscoat. In a level voice he said to Mother that he was going to go see to somethings at work.After he was gone, Mother, too, saw Nicci, forgotten on the floor, playing withbeads on a board, pretending to make chain mail. Her arms folded, she stood overNicci for a long moment.“Your father goes to whores, you know. I’m sure that’s where he’s off to now: awhore. You may be too young to understand, but I want you to know, so that youdon’t ever put any faith in him. He’s an evil man. I’ll not be his whore.“Now, put away your things and come with Mother. I’m going to see my friends.It’s time you came along and began learning about the needs of others, insteadof just your own wants.”At her friend’s house, there were a few men and several women sitting andtalking in serious tones. When they politely inquired after Father, Nicci’smother reported that he was off, “working or whoring, I don’t know which, andcan control neither.” Some of the women laid a hand on her her arm and comfortedher. It was a terrible burden she bore, they said.Across the room sat a silent man, who looked to Nicci as grim as death itself.Mother quickly forgot about Father as she became engrossed in the discussion herfriends were having about the terrible conditions of people in the city. Peoplewere suffering from hunger, injuries, sickness, disease, lack of skill, no work,too many children to feed, elderly to care for, no clothes, no roof over theirheads, and every other kind of strife imaginable. It was all so frightening.Nicci was always anxious when Mother talked about how things couldn’t go on theway they were for much longer, and that something had to be done. Nicci wishedsomeone would hurry up and do it.Nicci listened as Mother’s fellowship friends talked about all the intolerantpeople who harbored hate. Nicci feared ending up as one of those terriblepeople. She didn’t want the Creator to punish her for having a cold heart.Mother and her friends went on at great length about their deep feelings for allthe problems around them. After each person said their piece, they would steal aglance over at the man sitting solemnly in a straight chair against the wall,watching with careful, dark eyes as they talked.“The prices of things are just terrible,” a man with droopy eyelids said. He wasall crumpled down in his chair, like a pile of dirty clothes. “It isn’t fair.People shouldn’t be allowed to just raise their prices whenever they want. Theduke should do something. He has the king’s ear.”“The duke . . .” Mother said. She sipped her tea. “Yes, I’ve always found theduke to be a man sympathetic to good causes. I think he could be persuaded tointroduce sensible laws.” Mother glanced over the gold rim of her cup at the manin the straight chair.One of the women said she would encourage her husband to back the duke. Anotherspoke up that they would write a letter of support for such an idea.“People are starving,” a wrinkled woman said into a lull in the conversation.People eagerly mumbled their acknowledgment, as if this were an umbrella to runin under to escape the drenching silence. “I see it every day. If we could justhelp some of those unfortunate people.”One of the other women puffed herself up like a chicken ready to lay an egg.“It’s just terrible the way no one will give them a job, when there’s plenty ofwork if it was just spread around.”“I know,” Mother said with a tsk. “I’ve talked to Howard until I’m blue in theface. He just hires people who please him, rather than those needing the job themost. It’s a disgrace.”The others sympathized with her burden.“It isn’t right that a few men should have so much more than they need, while somany people have so much less,” the man with the droopy eyelids said. “It’simmoral.”“Man has no right to exist for his own sake,” Mother was quick to put in as shenibbled on a piece of dense cake while glancing again at the grimly silent man.“I tell Howard all the time that self-sacrifice in the service of others isman’s highest moral duty and his only reason for being placed in this life.“To that end,” Mother announced, “I have decided to contribute five hundred goldcrowns to our cause.”The other people gasped their delight, and congratulated Mother for hercharitable nature. They agreed, as they sneaked peeks across the room, that theCreator would reward her in the next life, and talked about all they would beable to do to help those less fortunate souls.Mother finally turned and regarded Nicci for a moment, and then said, “I believemy daughter is old enough to learn to help others.”Nicci sat forward on the edge of her chair, thrilled at the idea of at lastputting her hand to what Mother and her friends said was noble work. It was asif the Creator Himself had offered her a path to salvation. “I would so like todo good, Mother.”Mother cast a questioning look at the man in the straight chair. “BrotherNarev?”The deep creases of his face pleated to each side as the thin line of his mouthstretched in a smile. There was no joy in it, or in his dark eyes hooded beneatha brow of tangled white and black hairs. He wore a creased cap and heavy robesas dark as dried blood. Wisps of his wiry hair above his ears curled up aroundthe edge of the cap that came halfway down on his forehead.He stroked his jaw with the side of a finger as he spoke in a voice that almostrattled the teacups. “So, child, you wish to be a little soldier?”“Well . . . no, sir.” Nicci didn’t know what soldiering had to do with doinggood. Mother always said that father pandered to men in an eviloccupation-soldiers. She said soldiers only cared about killing. “I wish to helpthose in need.”“That is what we all try to do, child.” His spooky smile remained fixed on hisface as he spoke. “We here are all soldiers in the fellowship-the Fellowship ofOrder-as we call our little group. All soldiers fighting for justice.”Everyone seemed too timid to look directly at him. They glanced for a moment,looked away, then glanced back again, as if his face was not something to betaken in all at once, but sipped at, like a scalding-hot, foul-tasting remedy.Mother’s brown eyes darted around like a cockroach looking for a crack. “Why, ofcourse, Brother Narev. That is the only moral sort of soldier-the charitablesort.” She urged Nicci up and scooted her forward. “Nicci, Brother Narev, here,is a great man. Brother Narev is the high priest of the Fellowship of Order-anancient sect devoted to doing the Creator’s will in this world. Brother Narev isa sorcerer.” She cast a smile up at him. “Brother Narev, this is my daughter,Nicci.”Her mother’s hands pushed her at the man, as if she were an offering for theCreator. Unlike everyone else, Nicci couldn’t take her gaze from his hoodedeyes. She had never seen their like.There was nothing in them but dark cold emptiness.He held out a hand. “Pleased to meet you, Nicci.”“Curtsy and kiss his hand, dear,” Mother prompted.Nicci went to one knee. She kissed the knuckles so as not to have to put herlips on the spongy web of thick blue veins covering the back of his hairy handfloating before her face. The whitish knobs were cold, but not icy, as she hadexpected.“We welcome you to our movement, Nicci,” he said in that deep rattling voice ofhis. “With your mother’s caring hand raising you up, I know you will do theCreator’s work.”Nicci thought that the Creator Himself must be very much like this man.From all the things her mother told her, Nicci feared the Creator’s wrath. Shewas old enough to know that she had to start doing the good work her motheralways talked about, if she was to have any chance at salvation. Everyone saidMother was a caring, moral person. Nicci wanted to be a good person, too.But good work seemed so hard, so stern-not at all like her father’s work, wherepeople smiled and laughed and talked with their hands.“Thank you, Brother Narev,” Nicci said. “I will do my best to do good in theworld.”“One day, with the help of fine young people like you, we will change the world.I don’t delude myself; with so much callousness among men, it will take time towin true converts, but we here in this room, along with others of like mindthroughout the land, are the foundation of hope.”“Is the fellowship a secret, then?” Nicci asked in a whisper.Everyone chuckled. Brother Narev didn’t laugh, but his mouth smiled again. “No,child. Quite the contrary. It is our most fervent wish and duty to spread thetruth of mankind’s corruption. The Creator is perfect; we mortals are butmiserable wretches. We must recognize our wicked nature if we hope to avoid Hisrighteous wrath and reap our deliverance in the next world.“Self-sacrifice for the good of all is the only route to salvation. Ourfellowship is open to all those willing to give of themselves and live ethicallives. Most people don’t take us seriously. Someday they will.”Gleaming, mousy eyes around the room watched without blinking as his deep,powerful voice rose, like the Creator’s own fury.“A day will come when the hot flames of change will sweep across the land,burning away the old, the decaying, and the foul, to allow a new order to growfrom the blackened remains of evil. After we burn clean the world, there will beno kings, yet the world will have order, championed by the hand of the commonman, for the common man. Only then, will there be no hunger, no shivering in thecold, no suffering without help. The good of the people will be put above theselfish desires of the individual.”Nicci wanted to do good-she truly did. But his voice sounded to her like a rustydungeon door grating shut on her.All the eyes in the room watched her, to see if she was good, like her mother,“That sounds wonderful, Brother Narev.”He nodded. “It will be, child. You will help bring this to be. Let your feelingsbe your guide. You will be a soldier, marching toward a new world order. It willbe a long and arduous task. You must keep the faith. The rest of us in this roomwill not likely live to see it flourish, but perhaps you will live long enoughto one day see such a wondrous order come to pass.”Nicci swallowed. “I will pray for it, Brother Narev.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11The next day, loaded with a big basket of bread, Nicci was let out of thecarrage, along with a gaggle of other people from the fellowship, to fan out anddistribute bread to the needy. Mother had attired her in a ruffled red dress forthe special occasion. Her short white stockings had designs stitched in redthread. Filled with pride to at last be doing good, Nicci marched down thegarbage strewn street, armed with her basket of bread, thinking about the daywhen the hope of a new order could be spread to all so that all could finallyrise up out of destitution and despair.Some people smiled and thanked her for the bread. Some took the bread without aword or a smile. Most, though, were surly about it, complaining that the breadwas late and the loaves were too small, or the wrong kind. Nicci was notdiscouraged. She told them what Mother had said, that it was the baker’s fault,because he baked bread for profit, first, and since he received a reduced ratefor charity, baked that second. Nicci told them that she was sorry that wickedpeople treated them as second-rate, but that someday the Fellowship of Orderwould come to the land and see to it that everyone was treated the same.As Nicci walked down the street, handing out the bread, a man snatched her armand pulled her into the stench of a narrow dark alley. She offered him a loaf ofbread. He swiped the basket out of her hands. He said he wanted silver or gold.Nicci told him she had no money. She gasped in panic as he yanked her close. Hisfilthy probing fingers groped everywhere on her body, even violating her mostprivate places, looking for a purse, but found none hidden on her. He pulled offher shoes and threw them away when he found they had no coins hidden in them.His fist punched her twice in the stomach. Nicci crashed to the ground. He spata curse at her as he stole away into the shadowed heaps of refuse.Holding herself up on trembling arms, Nicci vomited into the oily water runningfrom under the mounds of offal. People passing the alley looked in and saw herretching there on the ground, but turned their eyes back to the street andhurried on their way. A few quickly darted into the alley, bent, and scooped upbread from the overturned basket before rushing off. Nicci panted, tearsstinging her eyes, trying to get her wind back. Her knees were bleeding. Herdress was splattered with scum.When she returned home, in tears, Mother smiled at seeing her. “Their plightoften brings tears to my eyes, too.”Nicci shook her head, her golden locks swinging side to side, and told Motherthat a man had grabbed her and hit her, demanding money. Nicci reached for hermother as she wailed in misery that he was a wicked, wicked man.Mother smacked her mouth. “Don’t you dare judge people. You are just a child.How can you presume to judge others?”Stopped cold, Nicci was bewildered by the slap, more startling than painful. Therebuke stung more. “But, Mother, he was cruel to me-he touched me everywhere andthen he hit me.”Mother smacked her mouth again, harder the second time. “I’ll not have youdisgrace me before Brother Narev and my friends with such insensitive talk. Doyou hear? You don’t know what made him do it. Perhaps he has sick children athome, and he needs money to buy medicine. Here he sees some spoiled rich child,and he finally breaks, knowing his own child has been cheated in life by thelikes of you and all your fine things.“You don’t know what burdens life has handed the man. Don’t you dare to judgepeople for their actions just because you are too callous and insensitive totake the time to understand them.”“But I think-”Mother smacked her across the mouth a third time, hard enough to stagger her.“You think? Thinking is a vile acid that corrodes faith! It is your duty tobelieve, not think. The mind of man is inferior to that of the Creator. Yourthoughts-the thoughts of anyone-are worthless, as all mankind is worthless. Youmust have faith that the Creator has invested His goodness in those wretchedsouls.“Feelings, not thinking, must be your guide. Faith, not thinking, must be youronly path.”Nicci swallowed back her tears. “Then what should I do?”“You should be ashamed that the world treats those poor souls so cruelly thatthey would so pitifully strike out in confusion. In the future, you should finda way to help people like that because you are able and they are not-that isyour duty.”That night, when her father came home and tiptoed into her room to see if shewas tucked in snugly, Nicci clutched two of his big fingers together and heldthem tight to her cheek. Even though her mother said he was a wicked man, itfelt better than anything else in the world when he knelt beside the bed andsilently stroked her brow.In her work on the streets, Nicci came to understand the needs of many of thepeople there. Their problems seemed insurmountable. No matter what she did, itnever seemed to resolve anything. Brother Narev said it was only a sign that shewasn’t giving enough of herself. Each time she failed, at Brother Narev’s orMother’s urging, Nicci redoubled her efforts.One night at dinner, after being in the fellowship several years, she said,“Father, there is a man I’ve been trying to help. He has ten children and nojob. Will you hire him, please?”Father looked up from his soup. “Why?”“I told you. He has ten children.”“But what sort of work can he do? Why would I want him?”“Because he needs a job.”Father set down his spoon. “Nicci, dear, I employ skilled workers. That he hasten children is not going to shape steel, now is it? What can the man do? Whatskills has he?”“If he had a skill, Father, he could get work. Is it fair that his childrenshould starve because people won’t give him a chance?”Father looked at her as if inspecting a wagonload of some suspicious new metal,Mother’s narrow mouth turned up in a little smile, but she said nothing.“A chance? At what? He has no skill.”“With a business as big as yours, surely you can give him a job.”He tapped a finger on the stem of his spoon as he considered her determinedexpression. He cleared his throat. “Well, perhaps I could use a man to loadwagons.”“He can’t load wagons. He has a bad back. He hasn’t been able to work for yearsbecause of his back troubling him so.”Father’s brow drew down. “His back didn’t prevent him from begetting tenchildren.Nicci wanted to do good, and so she met his stare with a steady look of her own.“Must you be so intolerant, Father? You have jobs, and this man needs one. Hehas hungry children needing to be fed and clothed. Would you deny him a livingjust because he has never had a fair chance in life? Are you so rich that allyour gold has blinded your eyes to the needs of humble people?”“But I need-”“Must you always frame everything in terms of what you need, instead of whatothers need? Must everything be for you?”“It’s a business-”“And what is the purpose of a business? Isn’t it to employ those who need work?Wouldn’t it be better if the man had a job instead of having to humiliatehimself begging? Is that what you want? For him to beg rather than work? Aren’tyou the one who always speaks so highly of hard work?”Nicci was firing the questions like arrows, getting them off so fast he couldn’tget a word through her barrage. Mother smiled as Nicci rolled out words she knewby heart.“Why must you reserve your greatest cruelty for the least fortunate among us?Why can’t you for once think of what you can do to help, instead of alwaysthinking of money, money, money? Would it hurt you to hire a man who needs ajob? Would it Father? Would it bring your business to an end? Would that ruinyou?”The room echoed her noble questions. He stared at her as if seeing her for thefirst time. He looked as if real arrows had struck him. His jaw worked, but nowords came out. He didn’t seem able to move; he could only gape at her.Mother beamed.“Well . . .” he finally said, “I guess . . .” He picked up his spoon and stareddown into his soup. “Send him around, and I’ll give him a job.”Nicci swelled with a new sense of pride-and power. She had never known it wouldbe so easy to stagger her father. She had just bested his selfish nature withnothing more than goodness.Father pushed back from the table. “I . . . I need to go back to the shop.” Hiseyes searched the table, but he would not look at Nicci or Mother. “I justremembered . . . I have some work I must see to.”After he had gone, Mother said, “I’m glad to see that you have chosen therighteous path, Nicci, instead of following his evil ways. You will never regretletting your love of mankind guide your feelings. The Creator will smile uponyou.”Nicci knew she had done the right thing, the moral thing, yet the thought thatcame to haunt her victory was the night her father had come into her room andsilently stroked her brow as she had held two of his fingers to her cheek.The man went to work for Father. Father never mentioned anything about it. Hiswork kept him busy and away from home. Nicci’s work took more and more of hertime, as well. She missed seeing that look in his eyes. She guessed she wasgrowing up.The next spring, when Nicci was thirteen, she came home one day from her work atthe fellowship to find a woman in the sitting room with Mother. Something aboutthe woman’s demeanor made the hair at the back of Nicci’s neck stand on end.Both women rose as Nicci set aside her list of names of people needing things.“Nicci, darling, this is Sister Alessandra. She’s traveled here from the Palaceof the Prophets, in Tanimura.”The woman was older than Mother. She had a long braid of fine brown hair loopedaround in a circle and pinned to the back of her skull like a loaf of braidedbread. Her nose was a little too big for her face, and she was plain, but not atall ugly. Her eyes focused on Nicci with an unsettling intensity, and theydidn’t dart about, the way Mother’s always did.“Was it quite a journey, Sister Alessandra?” Nicci asked after she had curtsied.“All the way from Tanimura, I mean?”“Three days is all,” Sister Alessandra said. A smile grew on her face as shetook in Nicci’s bony frame. “My, my. So little, yet, for such grownup work.” Sheheld out a hand toward a chair. “Won’t you sit with us, dear?”“Are you a Sister with the fellowship?” Nicci asked, not really understandingwho the woman was.“The what?”“Nicci,” Mother said, “Sister Alessandra is a Sister of the Light.”Astonished, Nicci dropped into a chair. Sisters of the Light had the gift, justlike her and Mother. Nicci didn’t know very much about the Sisters, except thatthey served the Creator. That still didn’t settle her stomach. To have such awoman right there in her house was intimidating-like when she stood beforeBrother Narev. She felt an inexplicable sense of doom.Nicci was also impatient because she had duties waiting. There were donations tocollect. She had older sponsors who accompanied her to some of the places. Forother places, they said a young girl could get better results by herself, byshaming people who had more than they deserved. Those people, who hadbusinesses, all knew who she was. They would always stammer and ask how herfather was. As she had been instructed, Nicci told them how pleased her fatherwould be to know they were thoughtful to the needy. In the end, most becamecivic-minded.Then, there were remedies Nicci needed to take to women with sick children.There wasn’t enough clothing for the children, either. Nicci was trying to getsome people to give cloth and other people to sew clothes. Some people had nohomes, others were crowded together in little rooms. She was trying to get somerich people to donate a building. Also, Nicci had been assigned the task oflocating jugs for women to bring water from the well. She needed to pay a visitto the potter. Soma of the older children had been caught stealing. Others hadbeen fighting, and a few of them were beating younger children bloody. Nicci hadbeen pleading on their behalf, trying to explain that they had no fair chance,and were only reacting to their cruel circumstance. She hoped to convince Fatherto take on at least a few so they might have work.The problems just kept mounting, without any end in sight. It seemed like themore people the fellowship helped, the more people there were who needed help.Nicci had thought she was going to solve the problems of the world; she wasbeginning to feel hopelessly inadequate. It was her own failing, she knew. Sheneeded to work harder.“Do you read and write, dear?” the Sister asked.“Not very much, Sister. Mostly just names. I’ve much too much to do for thoseless fortunate than myself. Their needs must come before any selfish desires ofmy own.”Mother smiled and nodded to herself.“Practically a good spirit in the flesh.” The Sister’s eyes teared. “I’ve heardabout your work.”“You have?” Nicci felt a flash of pride, but then she thought of how thingsnever seemed to get better, despite all her efforts, and her sense of failurereturned. Besides, Mother said pride was evil. “I don’t see what’s so specialabout what I do. The people in the streets are the ones who are special, becauseof their suffering in horrid conditions. They are the true inspiration.”Mother smiled contentedly. Sister Alessandra leaned forward, her tone serious.“Have you learned to use your gift, child?”“Mother teaches me to do some small things, like how to heal little troubles,but I know it would be unfair to flaunt it over those less blessed than I, so Itry my best not to use it.”The Sister folded her hands in her lap. “I’ve been talking to your mother, whilewe waited for you. She’s done a fine job of getting you started on the rightpath. We feel, however, that you would have so much more to offer were you toserve a higher calling.”Nicci sighed. “Well, all right. Maybe I can get up a little earlier. But Ialready have my duties to the needy, and I will have to fit this other in as Ican. I hope you understand, Sister. I’m not trying to get undeserved sympathy,honestly I’m not, but I hope you don’t need this calling done too soon, as I’malready quite busy.”Sister Alessandra smiled in a long-suffering sort of way. “You don’t understand,Nicci. We would like you to continue your work with us at the Palace of theProphets. You would be a novice at first, of course, but one day, you will be aSister of the Light, and as such, you will carry on with what you have started.”Panic welled up in Nicci like rising floodwaters. There were so many people whohung to life only by a thread she tended. She had friends at the fellowship whomshe had come to love. She had so much to do. She didn’t want to leave Mother,and even Father. He was evil, she knew, but he wasn’t evil to her. He wasselfish and greedy, she knew, but he still tucked her into bed, sometimes, andpatted her shoulder. She was sure she would see something in his blue eyesagain, if she just gave it time. She didn’t want to leave him. For some reason,she desperately needed to again see that spark in his eyes. She was beingselfish, she knew.“I have needy people here, Sister Alessandra.” Nicci blinked at her tears. “Myresponsibility is to them. I’m sorry but I can’t abandon them.”At that moment, Father came in the door. He stopped in an awkward posture, hislegs frozen in midstride, with his hand on the lever, staring at the Sister.“What’s this, then?”Mother stood. “Howard, this is Alessandra. She is a Sister of the Light. She’scome to-”“No! I’ll not have it, do you hear? She’s our daughter, and the Sisters can’thave her.”Sister Alessandra stood, giving Mother a sidelong glance. “Please ask yourhusband to leave. This is not his business.”“Not my business? She’s my daughter! You’ll not take her!”He lunged forward to seize Nicci’s outstretched hand. The Sister lifted a fingerand, to Nicci’s astonishment, he was thrown back in a sparkling flash of light.Father’s back slammed against the wall. He slid down, clutching his chest as hegasped for breath. Tears bursting forth, Nicci ran for him, but SisterAlessandra snatched her by the arm and held her back.“Howard,” Mother said through gritted teeth, “the child is my business to raise.I carry the Creator’s gift. You gave your word when our union was arranged thatif we had a girl and she had the gift I would have the exclusive authority toraise her as I saw fit. I believe this to be the right thing to do, what theCreator wants. With the Sisters she will have time to learn to read. She willhave time to learn to use her gift to help people as only the Sisters can. Youwill keep your word. I will see to this. I’m sure you have work to which youmust immediately return.”With the flat of his hand, he rubbed his chest. Finally, his arms dropped to hissides. Head down, he shuffled to the door. Before he pulled closed the door, hisgaze met Nicci’s. Through the tears, she saw the spark in his eyes, as if he hadthings to tell her, but then it was gone, and he pulled the door shut behindhimself.Sister Alessandra said it would be best if they left at once, and if Niccididn’t see him just now. She promised that if Nicci followed instructions, andafter she was settled, and after she had learned to read, and after she hadlearned to use her gift, she would see him again.Nicci learned to read and to use her gift and mastered everything else she wassupposed to master. She fulfilled all the requirements. She did everythingexpected of her. Her life, as a novice to become a Sister of the Light, wasnumbingly selfless. Sister Alessandra forgot her promise. She was not pleased tobe reminded of it, and found more work that Nicci needed to do.Several years after she had been taken to the palace, Nicci again saw BrotherNarev. She came across him quite by accident; he was working as a stablehand atthe Palace of the Prophets. He smiled his slow smile with his eyes fixed on her.He told her that he had gotten the idea to go to the palace by her example. Hesaid he wished to live long enough to see order come to the world.She thought it an odd occupation for him. He said that he found working for theSisters morally superior to contributing his labor to the evil of profit. Hesaid it mattered not if she chose to tell anyone at the palace anything abouthim or his work for the fellowship, but he asked her not to tell the Sistersthat he was gifted, since they would not allow him to continue to stay and workin the stables if they knew, and he would refuse to serve them should theydiscover his gift, because, he said, he wanted to serve the Creator in his ownquiet way.Nicci honored his secret, not so much out of any sense of loyalty, but mostlybecause she was kept far too busy with her studies and work to concern herselfwith Brother Narev and his fellowship. She rarely had occasion to see him,mucking out horse stalls, and as his importance in her childhood had faded intoher past, she never really even gave him a second thought. The palace had workthey wished her to put her attention to-much the same sort of work Brother Narevwould have approved of. Only many years later did she come to discover his realreasons for having been at the Palace of the Prophets.Sister Alessandra saw to it that Nicci was kept busy. She was allowed no timefor such selfish indulgences as going home for a visit. Twenty-seven years aftershe had been taken away to become a Sister of the Light, still a novice, Nicciagain saw her father. It was at his funeral.Mother had sent word for Nicci to return home to see Father because he was isfailing health. Nicci immediately rushed home, accompanied by Sister Alessandra.By the time Nicci arrived, Father was already dead.Mother said that for several weeks he had been begging her to send for hisdaughter. She sighed and said she put it off, thinking he would get better.Besides, she said, she hadn’t wanted to disturb Nicci’s important work-not forsuch a trivial matter. She said it had been the only thing he asked for: to seeNicci. Mother thought that was silly, since he was a man who didn’t care aboutpeople. Why should he need to see anyone? He died alone, while Mother was outhelping the victims of an uncaring world.By that time, Nicci was forty. Mother, though, still thinking of Nicci as ayoung woman because under the spell at the palace she had aged only enough tolook to be maybe fifteen or sixteen, told her to wear a pretty, brightly coloreddress, because it wasn’t really a sad occasion, after all.Nicci stood looking at the body for a long time. Her chance to see his blue eyesagain was forever lost. For the first time in years, the pain made her feelsomething, down deep inside. It felt good to feel something again, even if itwas pain.As Nicci stood looking at her father’s sunken face, Sister Alessandra told Niccithat she was sorry she had to take her away, but that in her whole life, she hadnot encountered a woman with the gift as powerful as it was in Nicci, and thatsuch a thing as the Creator had given her was not to be wasted.Nicci said she understood. Since she had ability, it was only right that she useit to help those in need.At the Palace of the Prophets, Nicci was said to be the most selfless, caringnovice they had under their roof. Everyone pointed to her, and told the youngernovices to look to Nicci’s example. Even the Prelate had commended her.The praise was but a buzz in her ear. It was an injustice to be better thanothers. Try as she might, Nicci could not escape her father’s legacy ofexcellence. His taint coursed through her veins, oozed from every pore, andinfected everything she did. The more selfless she was the more it onlyconfirmed her superiority, and thus her wickedness.She knew that could mean only one thing: she was evil.“Try not to remember him like this,” Sister Alessandra said after a long silenceas they stood before the body. “Try to remember what he was like when he wasalive.”“I can’t,” Nicci said. “I never knew him when he was alive.”Mother and her friends at the fellowship ran the business. She wrote Niccijoyful letters, telling her how she had put many of the needy to work at thearmorers. She said the business could afford it, with all the wealth it hadaccumulated. Mother was proud that that wealth could now be put to a moral use.She said Father’s death had been a cloaked blessing, because it meant help atlast for those who had always deserved it most. It was all part of the Creator’splan, she said.Mother had to raise her prices in order to pay the wages of all the people she’dgiven work. A lot of the older workers left. Mother said she was glad they weregone because they had uncooperative attitudes.Orders fell behind. Suppliers began demanding to be paid before deliveringgoods. Mother discontinued having the armor proofed because the new workerscomplained that it was an unfair standard to be held to. They said they weretrying their best, and that was what counted. Mother sympathized.The battering-mill had to be sold. Some of the customers stopped ordering armorand weapons. Mother said they would be better off without such intolerantpeople. She sought new laws from the duke to require work to be spread outequally, but the laws were slow in coming. The few remaining customers hadn’tpaid their account for quite a while, but promised to catch up. In the meantime,their goods were shipped, if late.Within six months of Father dying, the business failed. The vast fortune he hadbuilt over a lifetime was gone.Some of the skilled workers once hired by Father moved on, hoping to find workat armories in distant places. Most men who stayed could find only menial work;they were lucky to have that. Many of the new workers demanded Mother dosomething; she and the fellowship petitioned other businesses to take them on.Some business tried to help, but most were in no position to hire workers.The armory had been the largest employer in the area, and drew many other peopleemployed in other occupations. Other businesses, like traders, smallersuppliers, and cargo earners, who had depended on the armory, failed for lack ofwork, Businesses in the city, everything from bakers to butchers, lost customersand were reluctantly forced to let men go.Mother asked the duke to speak with the king. The duke said the king wasconsidering the problem.Like her father’s armory, other buildings were abandoned as people left to findwork in thriving cities elsewhere. Squatters, at the fellowship’s urging, tookover many of the abandoned buildings. The empty places became the sites ofrobberies and even murders. Many a woman who went near those places regrettedit. Mother couldn’t sell the weapons from her closed armory, so she gave them tothe needy so they might protect themselves. Despite her efforts, crime onlyincreased.In honor of all her good work, and her father’s service to the government, theking granted Mother a pension that allowed her to stay in the house, with areduced staff. She continued her work with the fellowship, trying to right allthe injustice that she believed was responsible for the failure of the business.She hoped one day to reopen the shop and employ people. For her righteous work,the king awarded her a silver medal. Mother wrote that the king proclaimed shewas as close to a good spirit in the flesh as he had ever seen. Nicci regularlyreceived word of awards Mother was given for her selfless work.Eighteen years later, when Mother died, Nicci still looked like a young woman ofperhaps seventeen. She wanted a fine black dress to wear to the funeral-thefinest available. The palace said that it was unseemly for a novice to make sucha selfish request, and it was out of the question. They said they would supplyonly simple humble clothes.When Nicci arrived home, she went to the tailor to the king and told him thatfor her mother’s funeral she needed the finest black dress he had ever made. Hetold her the price. She informed him she had no money, but said she needed thedress anyway.The tailor, a man with three chins, waxy down growing from his ears, abnormallylong yellowish fingernails, and an unfailing lecherous smirk, said there werethings he needed, too. He leaned close, lightly holding her smooth arm in hisknobby fingers, and intimated that if she would take care of his needs, he wouldtake care of hers.Nicci wore the finest black dress ever made to her mother’s funeral.Mother had been a woman who had devoted her entire life to the needs of others.Nicci could never again look forward to seeing her mother’s cockroach-browneyes. Unlike at her father’s funeral, Nicci felt no pain reach down to touchthat abysmal place inside her. Nicci knew she was a terrible person.For the first time, she realized that for some reason she simply no longercared.From that day on, Nicci never wore any dress but black.One hundred and twenty-three years later, standing at the railing overlookingthe great hall, Nicci saw eyes that stunned her with their sense of an innervalue held dear. But what had been an uncertain ember in her father’s eyes wasablaze in Richard’s. She still didn’t know what it was.She knew only that it was the difference between life and death, and that shehad to destroy him.Now, at long last, she knew how.If only, when she had been little, someone had shown her father such mercy."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12Trudging down the road between the edge of the city of Fairfield and the estatewhere the three Sisters had told her Emperor Jagang had set up his residence,Nicci scanned the surrounding jumble of the Imperial Order’s encampment, lookingfor a specific station of tents. She knew they would be somewhere in the area;Jagang liked to have them close at hand. Regular sleeping tents, wagons, and menlay like a dark soot over the fields and hills as far as she could see. Sky andland alike seemed tinted by a dusky taint. Sprinkled through the dark fields,campfires twinkled, like a sky full of stars.The day was becoming oppressively dim, not only with the approach of evening,but also from the dull overcast of churning gray clouds. The wind kicked up inlittle fits, setting tents and clothes flapping, fluttering the campfires’flames, and whipping smoke this way and that. The gusts helped coat the tonguewith the fetid stench of human and animal waste, smothering any pleasant butweak cooking aroma that struggled to take to the air. The longer the army stayedin place, the worse it would get.Up ahead, the elegant buildings of the estate rose above the dark grime at itsfeet. Jagang was there. Because he had access to Sisters Georgia, Rochelle, andAubrey’s minds, he would know Nicci was back. He would be waiting for her.The emperor would have to wait; she had something else to do, first. WithoutJagang able to enter her mind, she was free to pursue it.Nicci saw what she was looking for, off in the distance. She could just makethem out, standing above the smaller tents. She left the road and headed throughthe crowded snarl of troops. Even from the distance, she could distinguish thedistinctive sounds coming from the group of special tents-hear it over thelaughing and singing, the crackle of fires, the sizzle of meat in skillets, thescraping rasp of whetstones on metal, the ring of hammers on steel, and therhythm of saws.Boisterous men grabbed at her arms and legs or tried to snatch her dress as shemarched along, picking her way through the disorder. The rowdy soldiers were buta minor consideration; she simply pulled away, ignoring their mocking calls oflove, as she made her way through the throng. When a husky soldier seized herwrist in his powerful grip, yanking her around to a jerking halt, she pausedonly long enough to loose her power and burst his beating heart within hischest. Other men laughed when they saw him collapse to the ground with a thud,not yet realizing he was dead, but none tried to claim his intended prize. Sheheard the words “Death’s . Mistress” pass in whispers among the men.She finally made her way through the gauntlet. Soldiers played dice, ate beans,or snored in their bedrolls beside the tents where captives screamed under theagony of torture. Two men lugged a corpse, dragging some of its innards, out ofa big tent. They threw the flaccid form in a wagon with a tangle of others.Nicci snapped her fingers at an unshaven soldier coming from the direction ofanother tent. “Let me see the list, Captain.” She knew he was the officer incharge by the blue canvas cover of the register book he carried.He scowled at her a moment, but when he glanced down at her black dress, a lookof recognition came over his face. He passed her the grubby, rumpled book. Ithad a deep crease across the middle, as if someone had accidentally sat on it.The pages that had fallen out had been pushed back in, but they never fit rightand their edges stuck out here and there to become frayed and filthy.“Not much to report, Mistress, but please let His Excellency know that we’vetried just about every skill known, and she isn’t talking.”Nicci opened the book and began scanning the list of recent names and what wasknown about them.“Her? Who are you talking about, Captain?” she mumbled as she read.“Why, the Mord-Sith, of course.”Nicci turned her eyes up toward the man. “The Mord-Sith. Of course. Where isshe?”He pointed at a tent a ways off through the disarray. “I know His Excellencysaid he didn’t expect a witch of her dark talents to give us any informationabout Lord Rahl, but I was hoping to surprise him with good news.” He hooked histhumbs behind his belt as he let out a sigh of frustration. “No such luck.”Nicci eyed the tent for a moment. She heard no screams. She had never beforeseen one of those women, the Mord-Sith, but she knew a little about them. Sheknew that using magic against one was a deadly mistake.She went back to reading the entries in the register. There was nothing of muchinterest to her. Most of the people were from around here. They were merely asampling collected to check what they might know. They would not have theinformation she wanted.Nicci tapped a line near the end of the writing in the book. It said“Messenger.”“Where is this one?”The captain tilted his head, indicating a tent behind him. “I put one of my bestquestioners with him. Last I checked, there was nothing from him yet-but thatwas early this morning.”It had been all day since he had checked. All day could be an eternity undertorture. Like all the rest of the tents used for questioning prisoners, the onewith the messenger stood above the surrounding field tents, which were onlylarge enough for soldiers to lie in. Nicci pushed the book at the officer’sthick gut.“Thank you. That will be all.”“You’ll be giving His Excellency a report, then?” Nicci nodded absently at hisquestion. Her mind was already elsewhere. “You’ll tell him that there is littleto be learned from this lot?”No one was eager to stand before Jagang and admit they were unable to accomplisha task, even if there was nothing to accomplish. Jagang did not appreciateexcuses. Nicci nodded as she strode away, heading for the tent holding themessenger. “I’ll be seeing him shortly. I’ll give him the report for you,Captain.”As soon as she threw back the flap and entered, she saw that she was too late.The messy remains of the messenger lay on a narrow wooden table affixed withglistening tools of the trade.The messenger’s arm hung down off the sides,dripping warm blood.Nicci saw that the questioner had a folded piece of paper.”What have you there?”“A map of what?”“Where this fellow’s been. I drew it all out from what he volunteered.” Helaughed at his own humor. She didn’t.“Really,” Nicci said. The man’s grin was what had her attention. A man like thisonly grinned when he had something he’d been seeking, something to bring himfavor in the eyes of his superiors. “And where has the man been?”“To see his leader.”He waved the paper like a treasure map. Tired of the game, Nicci snatched thebooty from his hand. She unfolded the wrinkled yellow paper and saw that it wasindeed a map, with rivers, the coastline, and mountains all meticulously drawnout. Even mountain passes were noted.Nicci could tell that the map was authentic. When she had lived at the Palace ofthe Prophets, the New World was a far-off and mysterious place, rarely visitedby anyone but a few Sisters. Any Sister who ventured there always kept exactingrecords that were added to maps at the palace. Along with many other esotericitems, all novices memorized those maps in the course of their studies. Eventhough, at the time, she had never expected to travel to the New World, she wasthoroughly familiar with the lay of the land there. Nicci scrutinized the paperin her hands, carefully surveying the geography, overlaying everything on itthat was new onto the memorized map in her mind.The soldier pointed a thick finger at a single bloody fingerprint on the map.“That there is where Lord Rahl himself is hiding-on that dot, in thosemountains.”Nicci’s breath paused. She stared at the paper, burning the line of every streamand river, every mountain, every road, trail, and mountain pass, every village,town, and city into her memory.“What did this man confess before he died?” She looked up. “His Excellency iswaiting for my report. I was just on my way to see him.” She snapped her fingersimpatiently. “Let’s have it all.”The man scratched his beard. His fingernails were crusted with dried blood,“You’ll tell him, won’t you? You’ll tell His Excellency that Sergeant Wetzel wasthe one who got the information out of the messenger?”“Of course,” Nicci assured him. “You will receive full credit. I have no need ofsuch recognition.” She tapped the gold ring through her lower lip. “The Emperoris always-every moment of every day-in my mind. He no doubt this very momentsees through my eyes that you, not I, are the one who succeeded in getting theinformation. Now, what did this man confess?”Sergeant Wetzel scratched his beard again, apparently trying to decide if becould trust her to credit him, or if he should be sure and take the informationto Jagang. There was little trust among those in the Imperial Order, and goodreason to distrust everyone. As he scratched his beard, flakes of dried bloodstuck in its curly hair.Nicci stared into his red-rimmed eyes. He smelled of liquor. “If you don’treport everything to me, Sergeant Wetzel, and I mean right now, I will have youup on the table next, and I will have your report between your screams, and whenI’m done with you, they will throw you in the wagon with the rest of thecorpses.”He dipped his head twice in surrender. “Of course. I only wanted to be sure HisExcellency knew of my success.” When Nicci nodded, he went on. “He was just amessenger. We had a small unit of six men doing deep scouting patrol. They wenton a circle far to the north, around any enemy forces. They had one of thegifted women with them to help them remain at a good distance, so they wouldn’tbe detected. They were somewhere northwest of the enemy force, when by chancethey came across this man. They brought him back for me to question. Idiscovered he was one of a number of regular messengers sent back and forth toreport to Lord Rahl.”Nicci waggled a finger at the paper. “But this, down here, looks like the enemyforce. Are you saying Rich . . . Lord Rahl, isn’t with his men? With his army?”“That’s right. The messenger didn’t know why. His only duty was to carry trooppositions and regular news of their condition to his master.” He tapped the mapin her hand. “But right here is where Lord Rahl is hiding, along with his wife.”Nicci looked up, her mouth falling open. “Wife.”Sergeant Wetzel nodded. “The man said Lord Rahl married some woman known as theMother Confessor. She’s hurt, and they’re hiding way up there, in thosemountains.”Nicci remembered Richard’s feelings for her, and her name: Kahlan. Richard beingmarried put everything in a new light. It had the potential to disrupt Nicci’splans. Or . . .“Anything else, Sergeant?”“The man said Lord Rahl and his wife have one of them women, them Mord Sith,guarding them.”“Why are they up there? Why aren’t Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor with theirarmy? Or back in Aydindril? Or in D’Hara, for that matter?”He shook his head. “This messenger was just a low-ranking soldier who knew howto ride fast and read the lay of the land. That’s all he knew: they’re up there,and they’re all alone.”Nicci was puzzled by such a development.“Anything else? Anything at all?” He shook his head. She laid her hand on theman’s back, between his shoulder blades. “Thank you, Sergeant Wetzel. You havebeen more help than you will ever know.”As he grinned, Nicci released a flow of power that shot up through his spine andinstantly incinerated his brain inside his skull. He dropped with a crash to thehard ground, the air fleeing his lungs in a grunt.Nicci held up the map she had committed to memory and with her gift set itaflame. The paper crackled and blackened as the fire advanced across the riversand cities and mountains all carefully drawn out on it, until the hot glowsurrounded the bloody fingerprint over a dot in the mountains. She let the paperrise from her fingers as it was consumed in a final puff of smoke. Ash, likeblack snow, drifted down onto the body at her feet.Outside the tent where the Mord-Sith was held, Nicci cast a wary gaze across thesurrounding camp to see if anyone was watching. No one was paying any attentionto the business of the torture tents. She slipped in through the opening.Nicci winced at the sight of the woman laid out on the wooden table. She finallymade herself draw a breath.A soldier, his hands red from his work, scowled at Nicci. She didn’t wait forhim to object, but simply commanded, “Report.”“Not a word from her,” he growled.Nicci nodded and placed her hand on the soldier’s broad back. Wary of her hand,he began to step away from it, but he was too late. The man fell dead before heknew he was in trouble. Had she the time, she would have made him suffer first.Nicci made herself step up to the table and look down into the blue eyes. Thewoman’s head trembles slightly.“Use your power . . . to hurt me, witch.”A small smile touched Nicci’s lips. “To the bitter end, you would fight,wouldn’t you?”“Use your magic, witch.”“I think not. You see, I know a bit about you women.”Defiance blazed up from the blue eyes. “You know nothing.”“Oh, but I do. Richard told me. You would know him as your Lord Rahl, but be wasfor a time my student. I know that women like you have the ability to capturethe power of the gifted, if that power is used against you. Then, you can turnit against us. So, you see, I know better than to use my power on you.”The woman looked away. “Then torture me if that is what you came to do. You willlearn nothing.”“I’m not here to torture you,” Nicci assured her.“Then what do you want?”“Let me introduce myself,” Nicci said. “I am Death’s Mistress.”The woman’s blue eyes turned back, betraying for the first time a glint of hope,“Good. Kill me.”“I need you to tell me some things.”“I’ll not . . . tell you . . . anything.” It was a struggle for her to speak.“Nor anything. Kill me.”Nicci picked up a bloody blade from the table and held it before the blue eyes,“I think you will.”The woman smiled. “Go ahead. It will only hasten my death. I know how much aperson can take. I am not far from the spirit world. But no matter what you do,I’ll not talk before I die.”“You misunderstand. I do not wish you to betray your Lord Rahl. Didn’t you hearyour questioner hit the ground? If you turn your head a little more, perhaps youcan see that the man who did this to you is now dead. I don’t wish you to tellme any secrets.”The woman glanced, as best she could, toward the body on the ground. Her browtwitched. “What do you mean?”Nicci noticed that she didn’t ask to be freed. She knew she was well past thepoint of hope to live. The only thing she could hope for, now, was for Nicci toend her agony.“Richard was my student. He told me that he was once a captive of the Mord Sith.Now, that’s not a secret, is it?”“No.”“That’s what I want to know about. What is your name?”The woman turned her face away.Nicci put a finger to the woman’s chin and turned her head back. “I have anoffer to make you. I won’t ask you anything secret that you aren’t supposed totell. I’ll not ask you to betray your Lord Rahl-I wouldn’t want you to. Thoseare not the things that are of interest to me. If you cooperate” -Nicci held upthe blade again for the woman to see-”I will end it quickly for you. I promise.No more torture. No more pain. Just the final embrace of death.”The woman’s lips began trembling. “Please,” she whispered, the hope returning toher eyes. “Please . . . kill me?”“What is your name?” Nicci asked.Nicci, for the most part, was numb to sights of torture, but this she founddisturbing. She avoided looking away from the woman’s face, down at the nakedbody, so as not to have to consider what had been done to her. Nicci could notimagine how this woman could keep from screaming, or even how she was able tospeak.“Hania.” The woman’s hands and ankles were shackled to the table, so she wasunable to move much other than her head. She stared up into Nicci’s eyes. “Willyou kill me? . . . Please?”“I will, Hania, I promise. Quickly and efficiently-if you tell me what I want toknow.”“I can’t tell you anything.” In despair, Hania seemed to sag against the table,knowing her ordeal was to go on. “I won’t.”“I only want to know about when Richard was a captive. Did you know he was oncea captive of the Mord Sith?”“Of course.”“I want to know about it.”“Why?”“Because I want to understand him.”Hania’s head rocked side to side. She actually smiled. “None of us understandsLord Rahl. He was tortured, but he never . . . took revenge. We don’t understandhim.”“I don’t either, but I hope to. My name is Nicci. I want you to know that. I’mNicci, and I’m going to deliver you from this, Hania. Tell me about it. Please?I need to know. Do you know the woman who captured him? Her name?”The woman considered for a moment before she spoke, as if testing in her ownmind whether or not the information was in any way secret, or could in any wayharm him.“Denna,” Hania whispered at last.“Denna. Richard killed her in order to escape-he already told me that much. Didyou know Denna before she died?”“Yes.”“I’m not asking anything of secret military importance, am I?”Hania hesitated. She finally shook her head.“So, you knew Denna. And did you know Richard at the time? When he was there,and she had him? Did you know he was her captive?”“We all knew.”“Why is that?”“Lord Rahl-the Lord Rahl at the time-”“Richard’s father.”“Yes. He wanted Denna to be the one to train Richard, to prepare him to answerwithout hesitation whatever questions Darken Rahl asked him. She was the best atwhat we do.”“Good. Now, tell me everything about it. Everything you know.”Hania drew a shaky breath. It took a moment before she spoke again. “I won’tbetray him. I am experienced at what is being done to me. You cannot trick me. Iwill not betray Lord Rahl just to spare myself this. I have not endured thismuch to betray him now.”“I promise not to ask anything about the present-about the war-anything thatwould betray him to Jagang.”“If I tell you only about when Denna had him, and not about now, about the waror where he is or anything else, do you give me your word that you will end itfor me-that you will kill me?”“I give you my word, Hania. I wouldn’t ask you to betray your Lord Rahl-I knowhim and have too much respect for him to ask that of you. All I wish is tounderstand him for personal reasons. I was his teacher, last winter, instructinghim in the use of his gift. I want to understand him better. I need tounderstand him. I believe I can help him, if I do.”“And then you will help me?” There was a shimmer of hope along with the tears.“You will kill me, then?”This woman could aspire to nothing more, now. It was all that was left to her inthis life: a quick death to finally end the pain.“Just as soon as you’re finished telling me all about it, I will end yoursuffering, Hania.”“Do you swear it by your hope to an eternity in the underworld in the warmth ofthe Creator’s light?”Nicci felt a sharp shiver of pain wail up from her very soul. She had startedout near to one hundred and seventy years before wanting nothing but to help,and yet she could not escape the fate of her evil nature. She was Death’sMistress.She was a fallen woman.She ran the side of a finger down Hania’s soft cheek. The two women shared along and intimate look. “I promise,” Nicci whispered. “Quick and efficient. Itwill be the end of your pain.”Tears overflowing her eyes, Hania gave a little nod."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13The estate was a grand place, she supposed. Nicci had seen grandeur such as thisbefore. She had also seen much greater majesty, to be sure. She had lived amongsuch splendor for nearly one and three-quarters centuries, among the imposingcolumns and arches of immaculate rooms, the intricately carved stone vines andbuttery smooth wood paneling, the feather beds and silk coverlets, the exquisitecarpets and rich draperies, the silver and gold ornamentation, and the brightsparkle of windows made of colored glass composed into epic scenes. The Sistersthere offered Nicci brighteyed smiles and clever conversation.The extravagance meant no more to her than the rubble of the streets, the coldwet blankets laid on rough ground, the beds made in the slime among greasyrunnels in the muck of narrow alleys with nothing but the bitter sky overhead.The huddled people there never offered a smile, but gaped up at her with holloweyes, like so many pigeons cooing for alms.Some of her life was spent among splendor, some among garbage. Some people werefated to spend their lives in one place, some in the other, she in both.Nicci reached for the silver handle on one of the ornate double doors flanked bytwo husky soldiers who had probably been raised in a sty with the hogs, and sawthat her hand was covered in blood. She turned and casually wiped the hand onthe filthy, bloodstained fleece vest worn by one of the men. The biceps of hisfolded arms were nearly as thick as her waist. Although he scowled as shecleaned her hand on him, he made no move to stop her. After all, it wasn’t as ifshe were defiling him.Hania had kept her part of the bargain. Nicci rarely resorted to using a weapon;she usually used her gift. But of course, in this case, that could have been amistake. When she had held the knife over her throat, Hania had whispered herthanks for what Nicci was about to do. It was the first time anyone had everthanked Nicci before she had killed them. Few people ever thanked Nicci for thehelp she provided. She was able, they were not; it was her duty to serve theirneeds.When she had finished cleaning her hand on the mute guard, she flashed an emptysmile at his dark glaring visage and then went on through the doors into astately reception hall. A row of tall windows lining one wall of the room wastrimmed with wheat-colored drapes. Near their tasseled edges, the curtainssparkled in the lamplight as if they might be embellished with gold thread.Latesummer rain spattered against tightly shut glass panes that revealed onlydarkness outside, but reflected the activity inside. The pale wool carpets,graced with flowers painstakingly sculpted in relief by means ofdifferent-length yarn, were tracked with mud.Scouts came and went, along with messengers and soldiers giving their reports tosome of the officers. Other officers barked orders. Soldiers carrying rolledmaps followed a few of the higher-ranking men as they meandered around thestuffy room.One of the maps lay unrolled across a narrow table. The table’s silvercandelabrum had been set aside on the floor behind the table. As Nicci passedthe table, she glanced down and saw that it was missing many of the elements socarefully marked on the map drawn by the D’Haran messenger. On the map laid outover the narrow table, there was nothing but dark splotches from spilled ale inthe area to the northwest; in the map etched in Nicci’s mind, there were themountains, rivers, high passes, and streams there, and a dot, marking the placewhere Richard was, along with his Mother Confessor bride, and the Mord-Sith.Officers talked among themselves, some standing about, some half sitting oniron-legged, marbletopped tables, some lounging in padded leather chairs as theytook delicacies from silver trays borne on the trembling hands of sweatingservants. Others swilled ale from tall pewter mugs, and yet others drank winefrom dainty glasses, all acting as if they were intimate with such splendor, andall of them looking as out of place as toads at tea.An older woman, Sister Lidmila, apparently trying to be unobtrusive by coweringin the shadows beside the drapes, snapped upright when she saw Nicci marchingacross the room. Sister Lidmila stepped out of the shadows, briefly pausing tosmooth her dingy skirts, an act that could not possibly produce any noticeableimprovement; Sister Lidmila once had told Nicci that things learned in youthnever left you, and were often much easier to recall than yesterday’s dinner.Rumor had it that the old Sister, skilled in arcane spells known to only themost powerful sorceresses, had many interesting things from her youth to recall.Sister Lidmila’s leathery skin was stretched so tight over the bones of herskull that she reminded Nicci of nothing so much as an exhumed corpse. Ascadaverous looking as the aged Sister was, she advanced across the room inquick, sharp movements.When she was only ten feet away, Sister Lidmila waved an arm, as if not sureNicci would see her. “Sister Nicci. Sister Nicci, there you are.” She seizedNicci’s wrist. “Come along, dear. Come along. His Excellency is waiting for you.This way. Come along.”Nicci clasped the Sister’s tugging hand. “Lead the way, Sister Lidmila. I’mright behind you.”The older woman smiled over her shoulder. It wasn’t a pleasant or joyous smile,but one of relief. Jagang punished anyone who displeased him, regardless oftheir culpability.“What took you so long, Sister Nicci? His Excellency is in quite a state, he is,because of you. Where have you been?”“I had . . . business I had to attend to.”The woman had to take two or three steps for every one of Nicci’s. “Businessindeed! Were it up to me, I’d have you down in the kitchen scrubbing pots forbeing off on a lark when you are wanted.”Sister Lidmila was frail and forgetful, and she sometimes failed to realize shewas no longer at the Palace of the Prophets. Jagang used her to fetch people, orto wait for them and show them the way-usually to his tents. Should she forgetthe way, he could always correct her route, if need be. It amused him to use avenerable Sister of the Light -a sorceress reputedly possessing knowledge of themost esoteric incantations-as nothing more than an errand girl. Away from thepalace and it’s spell that slowed aging, Sister Lidmila was in a sudden headlongrush toward the grave. All the Sisters were.The round-backed Sister, her dangling arm swinging, shuffled along in front ofNicci, pulling her by her hand, leading her through grand rooms, up stairways,and down hallways. At a doorway framed in gold-leafed moldings, she finallypaused, touching her fingers to her lower lip as she caught her breath. Sobersoldiers prowling the hall painted Nicci with glares as dark as her dress. Sherecognized the men as imperial guards.“Here it is.” Sister Lidmila peered up at Nicci. “His Excellency is in hisrooms. Hurry, then. Go on. Go on, now.” She swirled her hands as if she weretrying to herd livestock. “In you go.”Before entering, Nicci took her hand from the lever and turned back to the oldwoman. “Sister Lidmila, you once told me that you thought I would be the onebest suited for some of the knowledge you had to pass on.”Sister Lidmila’s face brightened with a sly smile. “Ah, some of the more occultmagic interests you, at long last, Sister Nicci?”Nicci had never before been interested in what Sister Lidmila had occasionallypestered her to learn. Magic was a selfish pursuit. Nicci learned what she hadto, but never went out of her way to go beyond, to the more unusual spells.“Yes, as a matter of fact, I believe I am at last ready.”“I always told the Prelate that you were the only one at the palace with thepower for the conjuring I know.” The woman leaned close. “Dangerous conjuring,it is, too.”“It should be passed on, while you are able.”Sister Lidmila nodded with satisfaction. “I believe you are old enough. I couldshow you. When?”“I will come see you . . . tomorrow.” Nicci glanced toward the door. “I don’tbelieve I will be able to take a lesson tonight.”“Tomorrow, then.”“If I . . . do come around to see you, I will be most eager to learn. Iespecially wish to know about the maternity spell.”From what Nicci knew of it, the oddly named maternity spell might be just whatshe needed. It had the further advantage that once invoked, it was inviolate.Sister Lidmila straightened and again touched her fingers to her lower lip. Alook of concern crossed her face.“My, my. That one, is it? Well, yes, I could teach you. You have the ability-fewdo. I’d trust none but you to be able to bring such a thing to life; it requirestremendous power of the gift. You have that. As long as you understand and arewilling to accept the cost involved, I can teach you.”Nicci nodded. “I will come when I can, then.”The old Sister ambled on down the hall, deep in thought, already thinking aboutthe lesson. Nicci didn’t know if she would live to take the lesson.After she had watched the old Sister vanish around the corner, Nicci entered aquiet room lit by myriad candles and lamps. The high ceiling was edged with apainted leaf-and-acorn design. Plush couches and chairs upholstered in mutedbrowns were set about on thick carpets of rich yellows, oranges, and reds,making them look like a forest floor in the autumn. Heavy drapes had been pulledclosed across an expanse of windows. Two Sisters sitting on a couch leaped totheir feet.“Sister Nicci!” one virtually shouted in relief.The other ran to the double doors at the other side of the room and opened onewithout knocking, apparently by instruction. She stuck her head into the roombeyond to speak in a low voice Nicci couldn’t hear.The Sister leaped back when Jagang, in the inner room, roared, “Get out! All ofyou! Everyone else out!”Two more young Sisters, no doubt personal attendants to the emperor, burst outof the room. Nicci had to step out of the way as all four gifted women made forthe doorway leading out of the apartment. A young man Nicci hadn’t noticed inthe corner joined the women. None even glanced in Nicci’s direction as theyrushed to do as they were ordered. The first lesson you learned as a slave toJagang was that when he told you to do something, he meant you to do it rightnow. Little provoked him more than delay.At the door to the inner room, a woman Nicci didn’t recognize ran out, followingclose on the heels of the others. She was young and beautiful, with dark hairand eyes, probably a captive picked up somewhere along the long march, and nodoubt used for Jagang’s amusement. Her eyes reflected a world gone mad for her.Such were the unavoidable costs if the world was to be brought to a state oforder. Great leaders, by their very nature, came with shortcomings in character,which they themselves viewed as mere peccadilloes. The far-ranging benefitsJagang would bring to the poor suffering masses of humanity far outweighed hiscrass acts of personal gratification and the relatively petty havoc he wrought.Nicci was often the object of his transgressions. It was a price worth payingfor the help that would eventually accrue to the helpless; that was the onlymatter that could be considered.The outer door closed and the apartment was finally empty of everyone but Nicciand the emperor. She stood erect, head held high, arms at her sides, relishingthe quiet of the place. The splendor meant little to her, but quiet was a luxuryshe had come to appreciate, even if it was selfish. In the tents there wasalways the noise of the army pressed close around. Here, it was quiet. Sheglanced around the spacious and elaborately decorated outer room, contemplatingthe idea that Jagang would have acquired the taste for such places. Perhaps he,too, simply wanted quiet.She turned back to the inner room. He was just inside, waiting, watching her, amuscled mass of fury coiled in rage.She strode directly up to him. “You wished to see me, Excellency?”Nicci felt a stunning pain as the back of his beefy hand whipped across herface. The blow spun her around. Her knees hit the floor. He yanked her to herfeet by her hair. The second time, she clouted the wall before crashing to thefloor again. Stupefying pain throbbed through her face. When she had herbearings, she got her legs under her and stood before him again. The third time,she took a freestanding candelabrum down with her. Candles tumbled and rolledacross the floor. A long wisp of sheer curtain she had snatched as she grabbedfor support ripped away and drifted down over her as she and an upturned tableslammed to the floor. Glass shattered. Metal clattered as small items boundedaway.She was dizzy and stunned, her vision faltering. Her eyes felt as if they mighthave burst, her jaw as if it had been shattered, her neck as if the muscles hadripped.. Nicci lay sprawled on the floor, savoring the strident waves of pain,wallowing ‘n the rare sensation of feeling.She saw blood splattered across the light fringe of the carpet beneath her andacross the warns glow of wooden flooring. She heard Jagang yelling something ather, but she couldn’t make out the words over the ringing in her ears. With ashaky arm pushed herself up onto her hip. Blood warmed her fingers when shetouched them to her mouth. She relished the hurt. It had been so long since shehad felt anything, except for that too brief moment with the Mord-Sith. This wasa glorious wash of agony.Jagang’s brutality was able to reach down into the abyss, not only because ofthe cruelty itself, but because she knew she need not suffer it. He, too, knewthat she was here by her choice, not his. That only intensified his anger, andthus, her sensations.His rage seemed lethal. She merely noted the fact that she very probablywouldn’t leave the room alive. She would probably not get to learn SisterLidmila’s spells. Nicci simply waited to discover what fate had already decidedfor her.The room’s spinning finally slowed enough for her to once more make it to herfeet. She pulled herself up straight before the silent brawny form of EmperorJagang. His shaved head reflected points of light from some of the lamps. Hisonly facial hair was a two-inch braid of mustache growing above each corner ofhis mouth, and another in the center under his lower lip. The gold ring throughhis left nostril and its thin gold chain running to another ring in his left earglimmered in the mellow lamplight. Except for a heavy ring on each finger, hewas without the plundered assortment of royal chains and jewels he usually worearound his neck. The rings glistened with her blood.He was bare-chested, but unlike his head, his chest was covered in coarse hair.His muscles bulged, their tendons standing out as he flexed his fists. He hadthe neck of a bull, and his temperament was worse.Nicci, half a head shy of his height, stood before him, waiting, looking intothe eyes she used to see in her nightmares. They were a murky gray, withoutwhites, and clouded over with sullen, dusky shapes that stole across a surfaceof inky obscurity. Even though they had no evident iris and pupil-nothing butseeming dark voids where a normal person had eyes-she never had any doubtwhatsoever as to when he was looking at her.They were the eyes of a dream walker. A dream walker denied access to her mind.Now, she understood why.“Well?” He growled. He threw up his hands. “Cry! Yell! Scream! Beg! Argue makeexcuses! Don’t just stand there!”Nicci swallowed back the sharp taste of blood as she gazed placidly into hisscarlet glare.“Please be specific, Excellency, as to which one you would prefer, how long Ishould carry on, and if I should end it of my own accord, or wait for you tobeat me into unconsciousness.”He lunged at her with a howl of fury. He seized her throat in his massive fistto hold her as he struck her. Her knees buckled, but he held her up until shewas able to steady herself.He released her throat with a shove. “I want to know why you did that to Kadar!”She offered only a bloody smile to his anger.He wrenched her arm behind her back and pulled her hard against him. “Why wouldyou do such a thing! Why?”The deadly dance with Jagang had begun. She dimly wondered again if this timeshe would lose her life.Jagang had killed a number of the Sisters who had displeased him. Nicci’s safetyhim-such as it was-lay in her very indifference to her safety. Her utter disgustin her own life fascinated Jagang because he knew it was sincere.“Sometimes, you’re a fool,” she said with true contempt, “too arrogant to seewhat is in front of your nose.”He twisted her arm until she thought it surely would snap. His panting breathwas warn on her throbbing cheek. “I’ve killed people for saying much less thanthat.”She mocked him through the pain. “Do you intend to bore me to death, then? Ifyou want to kill me, seize me by the throat and strangle me, or slash me to abloody mess so that I will bleed to death at your feet-don’t think you cansuffocate me with the sheer weight of your monotonous threats. If you wish tokill me, then be a man and do so! Or else shut your mouth.”The mistake most people made with Jagang was to believe, because of his capacityfor such profound brutality, that he was an ignorant, dumb brute. He was not. Hewas one of the most intelligent men Nicci had ever met. Brutality was but hiscloak. As an outgrowth of his access to the thoughts of so many differentpeople’s minds, he was directly exposed to their knowledge, wisdom, and ideas;such exposure augmented his intellect. He also knew what people most feared. Ifanything about him frightened her, it was not his brutality, but hisintelligence, for she knew that intelligence could be a bottomless well of trulyinventive cruelty.“Why did you kill him, Nicci?” he asked again, his voice losing some of itsfire.In her mind, like a protective stone wall, was the thought of Richard. He had tosee it in her eyes. Part of Jagang’s rage, she knew, was at his own impotence atpenetrating her mind, of possessing her as he could so many others. Her knowingsmirk taunted him with what he could not have.“It amused me to hear the great Kadar Kardeef cry for mercy, and then to denyit.”Jagang roared again, a beastly sound out of place for such a mannerlybedchamber. She saw the blur of his arm swinging for her. The room whirledviolently around her. She expected to hit something with a bone-breaking impact.Instead, she upended and crashed onto unexpected softness: the bed, sherealized. Somehow, she had missed the marble and mahogany posts at thecorners-they surely would have killed her. Fate, it seemed, was trifling withher. Jagang landed atop her.She thought he might beat her to death now. Instead, he studied her eyes frominches away. He sat up, straddling her hips. His meaty hands pulled at the laceson the bodice of her dress. With a quick yank of the material, he exposed herbreasts. His fingers squeezed her bared flesh until her eyes watered.Nicci didn’t watch him, or resist, but instead went limp as he pushed her dressup around her waist. Her mind began its journey away, to where only she alonecould go. He fell on her, driving the wind from her lungs in a helpless grunt.Arms lying at her sides, her fingers open and slack, eyes unblinking, Niccistared at the folds of the silk in the canopy of the bed, her mind unaffected inthe distant quiet place. The pain seemed remote. Her struggle to breathe seemedtrivial.As he went about his coarse business, she focused her thoughts instead on whatshe was going to do. She had never believed possible what she now contemplated;now she knew it was. She had only to decide to do it.Jagang slapped her, causing her to focus her mind back on him. “You’re toostupid to even weep!”She realized he had finished; he was not happy that she hadn’t noticed. She hadto make an effort not to comfort her jaw, stinging from what to him was a smack,but to the person receiving it was a blow nearly strong enough to cripple. Sweatdripped from his chin onto her face. His powerful body glistened from theexertion she had not perceived.His chest heaved as he glared down at her. Anger, of course, powered the glare,but Nicci thought she saw a tinge of something else there, too: regret, or maybeanguish, or maybe even hurt.“Is that what you wish me to do, then, Excellency? Weep?”His voice turned bitter as he flopped onto his side beside her. “No. I wish youto react.”“But I am,” she said as she stared up at the canopy. “It is simply not thereaction you wish.”He sat up. “What’s the matter with you, woman?”She gazed up at him a moment, and then turned her eyes away.“I have no idea,” she answered honestly. “But I think I must find out.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14Jagang gestured. “Take off your clothes. You’re spending the night. It’s beentoo long.” This time, it was he who stared off at the walls. “I’ve missed you inmy bed, Nicci.”She didn’t answer. She did not believe that in his bed he missed anything. Shedidn’t believe she could conceive of him understanding what it was to miss aperson. What he missed, she thought, was being able to miss someone.Nicci sat up and threw her legs over the side of the bed as she untangledherself from the black dress. She pulled it off over her head and then laid itout across the back of a padded leather chair. She reclaimed her underthingsfrom the tangles of the bed covering and tossed them on the chair before drawingoff her stockings and placing them, too, on the seat of the chair. He watchedher body the whole time, watched her as she tended to her dress, smoothing it tostraighten what he had done to it, watched the mysterious allure of a womanacting a woman.When she had finished she turned back to him. She stood proudly, to let him seethat which he could have only by force, and never as a willing gift. She coulddetect the sense of privation in his expression. This, was the only victory shecould have: the more he took her by force, the more he understood that that wasthe only way he could ever have her, and the more it maddened him. She wouldjust as soon die as willingly give him the satisfaction of that gift, and heknew the brutal truth of that.He finally forced himself away from his private, bitter longing and looked upinto her eyes. “Why’d you kill Kadar?”She sat on the edge of the bed opposite him, just out of his easy reach, butwithin range of his lunge, and shrugged her bare shoulders.“You are not the Order. The Order is no single man, but an ideal of equity. Assuch, it will survive any one person. You serve that ideal and the Order, fornow, in the capacity of but a brute. The Order could use any brute to serve itspurpose. You, Kadar, or another. I simply eliminated someone who might one dayhave been a threat to you before you can rise above your present role.”He grinned. “You expect me to believe that you were doing me a kindness? Now youmock me.”“If it pleases you to think so, then do.”Her smooth white limbs were a vivid contrast to the heavy, dark, variegatedverdant bedcover and sheets. He lay back atop them against several rumpledpillows. immodestly displayed before her. His eyes looked even darker thanusual.“What’s all this talk I keep hearing about ‘Jagang the Just’?”“Your new title. It is the thing that will save you, the thing that will win foryou, the thing that will bring you more glory than anything else. Yet, in returnfor eliminating a future threat to your standing, and for making you a hero tothe people, you draw my blood.”He put an arm behind his head. “Sometimes you make me believe the stories fatpeople tell, that you really are crazy.”“And if you kill everyone?”“Then they will be dead.”“I have recently been through towns visited by your soldiers. It seems theydidn’t harm the people-at least, they didn’t slaughter everyone in sight, asthey did when fey began their march into the New World.”He lunged and seized a fistful of her hair. With a snarl, he yanked her onto herback beside him. She caught her breath as he rose up on an elbow and directedhis disturbing gaze down into her eyes.“It is your job to make examples of people, to show them that they mustcontribute to our cause; to make them fear the Imperial Order’s righteous wrath.That is the task I assigned you.”“Is that so? Then why did the soldiers not make examples, too? Why did they letthose towns be? Why did they not contribute to striking fear into the hearts ofthe people? Why didn’t they lay waste to every city and town in their path?”“And then who would I rule but my soldiers? Who would do the work? Who wouldmake things? Who would grow the food? Who would pay tribute? To whom will Ibring the hope of the Order? Who will there be to glorify the great EmperorJagang, if I kill them all?”He flopped onto his back. “You may be called Death’s Mistress, but we can’t haveit your way and kill everyone. In this world you are bound to the Order’spurpose. If people feel the Order’s arrival can mean nothing but their death,they will resist to the end. They must know that it is only their resistancewhich will bring a swift and sure death. If they realize our arrival offers thema moral life, a life which puts man under the Creator and the welfare of manabove all else, they will embrace us.”“You dealt death to this city,” she taunted, forcing him to unwittingly provethe validity of what she had done. “Even though they chose the Order.”“I’ve given orders that any people of the city still alive be allowed to go backto their homes. The rampage is ended. The people here betrayed their promisesand thus invited brutality; they saw it, but now that is finished and a new dayof order has come. The old ideas of separate lands are over, as it was ended inthe Old World. All people will be governed together, and will enter a new age ofprosperity together-under the Imperial Order. Only those who resist will becrushed-not because they resist, but because, ultimately, they are traitors tothe well-being of their fellow man and must be eliminated.“Here, in Anderith, was the turning point in our struggle. Richard Rahl was atlast cast out by the people themselves, who came to see the virtue of what weoffer. No longer can he claim to represent them.”“Yet you came in and slaughtered-”“The leaders here betrayed certain promises to me-who knows how much of thegeneral population may have collaborated in that-and so the people had to pay apuce, but collectively they have also earned a place in the Order for theircourage In emphatically rejecting Lord Rahl and the outdated, selfish,uninspired morals he offered them.“The tide has turned. People no longer have faith in Lord Rahl, nor can he nowhave any faith in them. Richard Rahl is a fallen leader.”Nicci smiled inwardly, a sad smile. She was a fallen woman, and Richard was afallen man. Their fate was sealed.“Perhaps here, in this one small place,” she said, “but he is far from defeated.He is still dangerous. After all, you failed to gain everything you sought herein Anderith because of Richard Rahl. He not only denied you a clear victory bydestroying vast stores of supplies and leaving the systems and services ofproduction in total disarray, but he also slipped right through your fingerswhen you should have captured him.”“I will have him!”“Really? I wonder.” She watched his fist, and waited until it relaxed before shecontinued. “When will you move our forces north, into the Midlands?”Jagang stroked his hand down his woolly chest. “Soon. I want to give them timeto become careless, first. When they grow complacent, I will strike north.“A great leader must read the nature of the battle, to be able to adjust histactics. We will be liberators, now, as we move north into the Midlands,bringing the Creator’s glory to the people. We must win the hearts and minds ofthe unconverted.”“You have decided this change? On your own? You do not consider the will of theCreator in your campaign?”He glared at her insolence, as if to tell her she knew better than to even asksuch a question.“I am the emperor; I need not consult our spiritual guides, but since their.counsel is always welcome, I’ve already talked to the priests. They’ve spokenfavorably about my plans. Brother Narev thinks it wise and has given hisblessing. You had better keep to your job of extinguishing any ideas ofopposition. If you don’t follow my orders, well, no one will miss one Sister. Ihave others.”She was not moved by his threats, real as they were. By his suspicious look, hewas beginning to understand her vision, too.“What you are doing is fitting,” she said, “but it must be cut up into littlepieces the people can chew. They do not have the Order’s wisdom in seeing whatis best for them-the public rarely does. Even one as bullheaded as you must beable to see that I have anticipated your plans by helping those you can’t affordto kill to understand that you are sparing them out of your sense of justice.Word of such deeds will win hearts.”He cast her a sidelong glance. “I am the Order’s cleansing fire. The fire is anecessary conflagration, but not the important end-it is merely the means to theend. From the ashes I, Jagang, create, new order can sprout and grow. It is thisend, this glorious new age of man, that warrants the means. In this, it is myresponsibility not yours-to decide justice, when and how I will dispense it, andwho will receive it.”She grew impatient with his vanity. Scorn seeped into her voice. “I have simplyput a name to it-Jagang the Just-and begun to spread your new title for you whenthe opportunity arose. I sacrificed Kadar to that end, for all the same reasonsyou’ve listed. It had to be done now in order for it to have the necessary timeto spread and flourish, or the New World would soon harden irreversibly againstthe Order. I chose the time and place, and by using Kadar Kardeef’s life-a warhero’s life-proved your devotion to the cause of the Order above all else. Youbenefit.”“Any brute could ignite the conflagration; this new title shows your moralvision-another manifestation of worth over other men. I have planted the vitalseed that will make you a hero to the common people and, even more important, tothe priests. Are you going to pretend you think the title inadequate? Or that itwill not serve you well?“What I alone have done will help win what your powerful army cannot: willingallegiance without a battle, at a cost of nothing. With Kadar’s life, I, Nicci,have made you more than you could make of yourself. I, Nicci, have given you thereputation of honor. I, Nicci, have made you into a leader people will trustbecause they believe you to be just.”He brooded for a time, turning his gaze from her hot glare. His arm finally fellown and his fingers tenderly trailed down her thigh. The touch was an admissionfor him-an admission that she was right, even if he would not say the words.After a few moments he yawned, and then his eyes closed. His breathing evened,and he started to drift off into a nap, as was his way with her. He expected herto remain right where she was, so that when he awoke she would be available tohim. She supposed she could leave. But it was not time. Not yet.He finally awoke an hour later. Nicci was still staring up at the canopy,thinking about Richard. There seemed to be one piece missing in her plan, onemore thing that she felt needed to fall into place.In his sleep Jagang had rolled over on his side facing away from her. Now, heturned back. His dark eyes took her in with a look of lust rekindled. He drewher close. His body was as warm as a rock in the sun and only slightly softer.“Pleasure me,” he commanded in a husky growl that would have frightened anyother woman into doing as ordered.“Or what? You will kill me? If I feared that, I would not be here. This is byforce, not consent. I will not willingly take part in it, nor will I allow youto deceive yourself into believing that I want you.”He backhanded her, knocking her across the bed. “You take part willingly!” Heseized her by the wrist and dragged her back toward him. “Why else would you behere?”“You ordered me here.”He smirked. “And you came when you could have fled.”She opened her mouth, but she had no answer she could put into words, no answerhe would understand.With a grin of victory, he fell on her and pressed his lips to hers. As much asit hurt her, for Jagang this was gentle behavior. He had told her several timesthat she was the only woman he ever cared to kiss. He seemed to believe that byexpressing those emotions for her, she could have no alternative but tosurrender feelings in kind, as if spoken feelings were currency with which hecould purchase affection on demand.It was only the beginning of a long night a long ordeal she knew. She would haveto endure his forceful violation several more times before morning. His questionhaunted the distant place in her mind.Morning came, accompanied by the dull throbbing of a headache from hersucceeding beating, and the sharper aches from the places where he’d struck herwhen he came to find that what he thought was her willing submission was but adelusion that left him more angered than before. The pillows were stained withher blood. It had been a long night of rare sensations experienced.Now she knewshe was evil, and deserved to be violated in such a brutal fashion. She couldoffer no moral objection to it; even in the terrible things he did to her,Jagang was nowhere near as corrupt as she. Jagang erred in simple matters of theflesh, and that could only be expected all people were corrupt in the flesh-butbecause of her indifference to the suffering around her, she failed in mattersof the spirit. That, she knew, was pure evil. That was why she deserved tosuffer whatever he did to her. For the moment, that deep dark place within cameclose to being sated.Nicci touched her mouth and found the cuts painful, but closed. The healing ofwounds, though, did not offer the warranted sensations of receiving them, so sheresolved to have one of the other Sisters heal her, rather than give him thesatisfaction of witnessing her suffering the inconvenience of the injures.With that, her mind turned to thoughts of Sister Lidmila.Nicci realized that Jagang wasn’t in bed beside her. She sat up and saw him in achair not far away, watching her.She pulled the sheet up to cover her breasts, speckled with droplets of driedblood. “You are a pig.”“You can’t get enough of me. Despite what you say, Nicci, you wish to be withme. If not, why would you stay?”Those nightmare eyes of his watched her, trying to find a way into her mind.There was none. He could no longer be a nightmare for her. Richard guarded hermind.“Not for the reasons you wish to believe. I stay because the ultimate cause ofthe Order is a moral one. I wish it to succeed. I wish the suffering of life’shelpless victims to end. I wish everyone to finally be equal and to finally livewith everything they need. I have worked nearly my entire life for those goals.The Order can see to it that such a fair world comes to be. If I must endureyou-even aid you-for such an end, then it is but an insignificant gnat toswallow.”“You sound so very noble, but I think there is something more basic behind it. Ithink you would have left if you could, or”-he smiled-”if you could, you wouldhave left if you really wanted to. Which is it, then, Nicci?”She didn’t want to contemplate the question. Her head hurt.“What’s all the talk about you building a palace?”“So you heard, then.” He took a deep breath and sighed wistfully. “It will bethe grandest palace ever built. A fitting place for the Emperor of the ImperialOrder, for the man who rules both the Old and the New Worlds.”“The man who wants to rule. Lord Rahl stands in your way. How many times has hebested you, now?”Jagang’s eyes flashed a rage she knew could turn violent. Richard had frustratedJagang a number of times. Even if Richard hadn’t been victorious over Jagang, hehad stung him. Quite an accomplishment, really, for such a tiny force againstthe array of the Imperial Order. A man like Jagang hated the humiliation of asting almost as much as he would hate to be gored.“I will eliminate Richard Rahl, don’t you worry,” Jagang said in a low growl’She changed the subject back to what she really wanted to know about. “Sine whenhas the all conquering Emperor Jagang turned soft and wanted to live insplendor?”“Ali, but I am Jagang the Just, now. Remember?” He returned to the bed andflopped down beside her. “Nicci, I’m sorry I hurt you. I never want to hurt you,but you make me do it. You know I care about you.”You care about me yet you beat me? You care about me, yet you never bothered totell me of such an enormous project as the building of a palace? I aminsignificant to you.“I told you, I’m sorry I hurt you-but that was your own fault and you know it.”He spoke the words almost lovingly. With mention of the palace, his face hadsoftened into a visionary look. “It’s only proper and fitting that I at lasthave the prestige of such a monumental edifice.”“You, the man who was content in tents in the, field, now wants to live in aresplendent building? Why?”“Because once I bring the New World under the guidance of the Order, I will oweit to all the people, as their leader, to be seen in a majestic setting . . .but it will have more than simple splendor.”“But of course,” she sniped.He gathered up her hand. “Nicci, I will proudly wear the title Jagang the Just.You’re right, the time has come for such a move. I was only angered because youwrongly made that move without first discussing it with me. But let us forgetthat, now.”She said nothing. He gripped her hand more tightly, to show his sincerity, shesupposed.“You’re going to love the palace, when it’s finished.” He ran the back of thefingers of his other hand tenderly down her cheek. “We will all live there for avery long time.”The words struck a cord in her. “A very long time?”For the first time she realized there was something more to this than simply hisvanity of wanting a palace after Richard had denied him the Palace of theProphets. He wanted what else Richard had denied him. Could it be . .She looked up into his face, searching for the answer. He simply smiled at thequestions in her eyes.“Construction has already begun,” he said, turning his words away from thosequestions. “Architects and great builders from all over the Old World havegathered to work on it. Everyone wants to be part of such a grand project.”“And Brother Narev?” she probed. “What does he think of building such afrivolous monument to one man when there is important work to be done for somany needy people?”“Brother Narev and his disciples greatly favor the project.” Jagang flashed hera sly smile. “They will live there, too, of course.”Understanding washed over her.“He’s going to spell the new palace,” she whispered in astonishment to herself.Jagang only smiled as he watched her, clearly pleased with her reaction.Brother Narev had been at the Palace of the Prophets almost as long as she,nearly one hundred and seventy years, but in all that time he seemed to haveaged only ten or fifteen years-the same as she. No one but Nicci ever knew hewas anything but a stablehand-they didn’t know he was gifted.In all that time, with her, along with everyone else, paying him little heed, hemust have been studying the spell around the palace. From what she knew, most ofBrother Narev’s disciples had been young wizards from the Palace of theProphets; they had access to the vaults. They, too, could have added informationthat helped him. But could he really do such a thing?“Tell me about the palace,” she said, preferring his voice to the silentscrutiny of nightmare eyes.He kissed her first, the way a man kisses a woman, not the way a brute kisses avictim. She endured it with no more favor than any of the rest of it. He seemednot to notice, this time, and by the smile of his face, appeared to have enjoyedit.“It will be a walk of nearly fifteen miles to walk all the halls.” He swept ahand out and began to give shape to the grand palace in the air before them. Ashe went on, he stared off at his imaginary outline, hanging there in space.“The world has never seen anything to match it. While I carry on with our workof bringing the hope of the Order to the New World, of bringing the true word ofthe Creator to the wicked and the greedy, of banishing the selfish ideals of theancient religion of magic, back in my homeland the work of building the palacewill go on.“Quarries will be busy for years extracting all the rock that will go into theconstruction. The variety of stone will leave no doubt about the glory of theplace. The marble will be the finest. The woods will be only the best. Everymaterial going into the palace will be exceptional. The best craftsmen willshape it all into a grand structure.”“Yes, but, despite the fact that others may live there,” she mocked in cooldisdain, “it will be but a pompous monument to only one man: the great andpowerful Emperor Jagang.”“No, it will be devoted to the glory of the Creator.”“Oh? And will the Creator be taking up residence there, too, then’?”Jagang scowled at her blasphemy. “Brother Narev wishes the palace to beinstructional to the people. He is contributing his spiritual guidance to theundertaking, and will personally oversee the construction while I cleanse theway for the Order.”That was what she wanted to know.He stared off at the invisible shape still hanging in the air before them. Hisvoice took on a reverent tone.“Brother Narev shares my vision in this. He has always been like a father to me.He put the fire in my belly. His spiritual direction has been a lifelonginspiration. He allows me to stand at the fore, and take the glory of ourvictories, but I would be nothing without his moral teachings. What I win isonly as the fist of the Order, and a fist is but one part of the whole, as weare all but insignificant fragments of society as a whole. You are right: manyothers could stand in my place for the Order. But it is my part to be the one tolead us. I would never do anything to betray the trust Brother Narev has placedin me-that would be like betraying the Creator Himself. He guides the way forall of us.“I only thought to build a fitting palace for us all, a place from which togovern for the benefit of the people. It was Brother Narev who took up the dreamand gave it moral meaning by envisioning everyone, when they see the vaststructure, as seeing man’s place in the new order-seeing that man can never liveup to the glory of the Creator, and that, individually, he is but a meaninglessmember of the greater brotherhood of man and thus can have no greater part toplay than to uplift all his brothers in need so all will thrive together. Yet,it will also be a place that will humble every man before it, by showing him hisutter insignificance before the glory of his Creator, by showing man’sdepravity, his tortured, contorted, inferior nature, for all men in this worldare such as this.”Nicci could almost see such a place when he spoke of it. It would indeed be ahumbling inspiration to the people. He, came near to inspiring her with suchtalk, as Brother Narev had at one time inspired her.“This is why I have stayed,” she whispered, “because the cause of the Order isrighteous.”The piece that had been missing was now found.In the quiet, Jagang kissed her again. She allowed him to finish it, and thenpushed away from his embrace. With a distant smile, he watched as she rose andbegan dressing.“You’re going to love it there, Nicci. It will be a place befitting you.”“Oh? As the Slave Queen?”“As a queen, if you wish it. I plan to give you the kind of authority you’venever before had. We’ll be happy there, you and I, truly happy. For a long, longtime, we’ll be happy there.”She drew a stocking up her leg. “When Sister Ulicia and the four with her foundaway to leave you, I chose to ignore their discovery and stay, because I knowthe Order is the only moral course for mankind. But now I-”“You stayed because you would be nothing without the Order.”She looked away from his eyes. She tugged her dress down over her head, pokedher arms through the sleeves, and worked the skirt over her hips. “I am nothingwithout the Order, and I am nothing with it. No one is. We are all inadequate,miserable creatures; that is the nature of man; that is what the Creatorteaches. But the Order shows man his duty to make a better life for the good ofall.”“And I am the emperor of the Imperial Order!” His red face cooled more slowlythan it had heated. He gestured vaguely in the hollow silence and he went on ina more mellow tone. “The world will be one under the Order. We’ll be happy atthe palace when it’s finished, Nicci. You and I, under the spiritual guidance ofour priests. You’ll see. In time, when-’“I’m leaving.” She drew on a boot.“I will not permit it.”Nicci paused at pulling on her other boot and glanced up into his dark eyes. Sheflicked a finger toward a stone vase on a table against the far wall. Lightflashed. The vase exploded in a cloud of dust and chips with a sound that rockedthe room. The draperies shuddered. The panes in the windows chattered.When the dust had settled, she said, “You will not permit it?” She bent forwardand began doing up the laces on her boots.Jagang strolled over to the table and dragged his fingers through the dust thatwas all that remained of the stone vase. He turned back to her in all his naked,hairy, imperial glory.“Are you threatening me? Do you actually think you could use your power againstme?”“I do not think it”-she yanked the laces tight-”I know it. The truth is I choosenot to.”He struck a defiant pose. “And why is that?”Nicci stood and faced him. “Because, as you said, the Order needs you, orrather, a brute like you. You serve the ends of the Order-you are their fist.You bring that cleansing fire. You perform that function very well. It couldeven be said that you perform that service with extraordinary talent.“You are Jagang the Just. You see the wisdom in the title I have given you, andwill use it to further the cause of the. Order. That is why I choose not to useany power against you. It would be like using my power against the Order,against my own duty to the future of mankind.”“Then why do you want to leave?”“Because I must.” She gave him a look of icy determination, and deadly threat.“Before I go, I will be spending some time with Sister Lidmila. You are toimmediately and completely withdraw from her mind and remain out of it theentire time I am with her. We will use your tents, since you are not using them.You will see to it that everyone leaves us entirely alone for however long ittakes us. Anyone who enters, without my express permission, will die. Thatincludes you. You have my oath, as a Sister of the Dark, on that. When I’mfinished, and after I leave, you may do what you will with Sister Lidmila killher if that is your wish, although I don’t see why you would want to bother,since she is going to be doing you a great service.”“I see.” His huge chest rose. He let the deep breath out slowly. “And how longwill you be gone, this time, Nicci?”“This is not like the other times. This is different.”“How long?”“Perhaps only a short time. Perhaps a very long time. I don’t yet know. Leave mealone to do as I must, and, if I can, I will one day return to you.”He gazed into her eyes, but he could not look into her mind. Another manprotected her mind, and kept her thoughts her own.In all the time she had spent with Richard, Nicci had never learned that whichshe hungered most to know, but in one way, she had learned too much. Most of thetime she was able to entomb that unwanted knowledge under the numb weight ofindifference. Occasionally, though, it would, like now, unexpectedly rise up outof its tomb to seize her. When it did, she was helpless in its grip, and coulddo nothing but wait for the oblivion of numb detachment to bury it yet again.Staring into the long dark night of Jagang’s inhuman eyes, eyes that revealednothing but the bleakness of his soul, Nicci touched her finger to the gold ringJagang had ordered pierced through her lower lip to mark her as his personalslave. She released a thread-thin channel of Subtractive Magic, and the ringceased to exist.“And where are you going, Nicci?”“I am going to destroy Richard Rahl for you.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander had been able to talk and smile his way past the othersoldiers, but these were not moved by his explanation that he was Richard’sgrandfather. He supposed he should have entered the camp in the daylight-itwould have avoided a lot of the suspicion-but he was tired and hadn’t thought itwould be that much trouble.The soldiers were properly suspicious, which greatly pleased him, but he wasweary and had more important things to do than answer questions: he wanted toask them, instead.“Why do you want to see him?” the bigger guard repeated.“I told you, I’m Richard’s grandfather.”“This is the Richard Cypher, you’re talking about, who you now say-”“Yes, yes, that was his name when he grew up and that’s what I’m used to callinghim, but I meant Richard Rahl, who he is now. You know, Lord Rahl, your leader?I would think being the grandfather of someone as important as your Lord Rahlwould accord me some respect. Maybe even a hot meal.”“I could say I’m Lord Rahl’s brother,” the man said, keeping a tight grip on thebit in the mouth of Zedd’s horse, “but that doesn’t make it so.”Zedd sighed. “How very true.”As vexing as it was, Zedd, at some dim inward level, was pleased to see that themen weren’t stupid, nor easily duped.“But I’m also a wizard,” Zedd added, drawing low his eyebrows for dramaticeffect. “If I wasn’t friendly, I could simply do you up crisp and be on my waypast the both of you.”“And if I wasn’t friendly,” the man said, “I could give the signal-now thatwe’ve let you venture in this far so that you’re completely surrounded-and thedozen archers hiding all around you in the dark would let fly the arrows thatare at this moment trained on you, as they have been ever since you approachedour encampment.”“Ah,” Zedd said, holding up a finger in triumph, “all very well and good, but-”“And even if I were to die in a final flame of service to the Lord Rahl, thosearrows will let fly without me needing to give any signal.”Zedd harrumphed, lowering his finger, but inwardly he smiled. Here he was, FirstWizard, and if he weren’t entering a friendly camp, he would have been bested inthis game of banter by a simple soldier.Or maybe not.“In the first place, Sergeant, I am, as I said, a wizard, and so I knew of thearchers and have already dealt with the threat by spelling their arrows so theywill fly no truer and with no more deadly effect than wet dishrags. I havenothing to fear from them. In the second place, even if I’m lying-which isprecisely what you are considering at this very moment-you have made a mistakeby telling me of the threat, which enables me, as a wizard of great repute, tonow use my magic to nullify it.”A slow smile came to the man’s face. “Why, that’s remarkable.” He scratched hishead. He looked to his partner and then back to Zedd. “You’re right, that wasexactly what I was thinking: that you could be lying about knowing the archerswere back there in the dark.”“You see there, young man? You’re not so smart after all.”“You’re right, sir, I’m not. Here I was, so busy talking to you and being sointimidated by your wizardly powers and all, that I plumb forgot to tell youabout what else was out there in the dark, watching you . . .”-the soldier’sbrow lowered-”and it would be a mite more trouble than any simple arrows, I daresay.”Zedd scowled down at the man. “Now see here-”“Why don’t you do as I ask and come down here in the light, where I can see youbetter, and answer some of our questions’?”With a sigh of resignation, Zedd dismounted. He gave Spider a reassuring pat onher neck. Spider, a chestnut-colored mare, had a leggy black splotch on hercreamy rump, from which she had acquired her name. Young, strong, and possessingan agreeably spirited nature, she made a pleasant traveling companion. The twoof them had been through a great deal together. `Zedd stepped into the intimate circle of light from the watch fire. He turnedhis a hand up and brought a white-hot flame to life just above the flesh of hispalm. The two soldiers’ eyes widened. Zedd scowled.“But, I have my own fire, if you need to see better. Does this help you seethings better, Sergeant?”“Uh . . . why, yes it does, sir,” the man stammered.“Yes, it does indeed,” a woman said as she stepped into the light. “Why didn’tyou simply use your Han and give a display of your craft in the first place?”She motioned into the darkness, as if signaling for others to stand down. Sheturned back with a smile that was no more than courteous. “Welcome, wizard.”Zedd bowed from the waist. “Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander, First Wizard, at yourservice . . . ?”“Sister Philippa, Wizard Zorander. I am aid to the Prelate.”She gestured and the sergeant took the reins from Zedd’s hand to lead the horseaway. Zedd clapped the man on the back to let him know there were no hardfeelings, and then gave a similar pat to Spider to let her know it was all rightto go with the men.“Treat her especially well, Sergeant. Spider is a friend.”The sergeant saluted by tapping his fist to his heart. “She’ll be treated as afriend, sir.”After the soldiers had led Spider away, Zedd said, “The Prelate? Which one?”The narrow-jawed Sister clasped her hands together. “Prelate Verna, of course.”“Oh, yes, of course. Prelate Verna.”The Sisters of the Light didn’t know Ann was still alive. At least, she had been‘ alive when Zedd last saw her, several months past. Ann had written in herjourneybook, telling Verna that she was alive, but also asking her to keep thatinformation x private for the time being. Zedd had been hoping that perhaps Annhad turned up at the D’Haran army camp, with her Sisters of the Light. He wassorry to learn she hadn’t. It boded ill for her.Zedd held no favor with the Sisters of the Light-a lifetime of disapproval wasnot easily forgotten but he had come to respect Ann as a woman ofself-discipline and resolve, even if he took a dim view of some of herconvictions and past objectives. He knew that, at the least, he and Ann sharedmany important values. He didn’t know about the rest of the Sisters, though.Sister Philippa appeared middle-aged, but with Sisters that meant little. Shemight have lived at the Palace of the Prophets for only a year, or forcenturies. With dark eyes and high cheekbones she was an exotic-looking woman.As in the Midlands, there were places in the Old World where the people hadunique physical characteristics. Sister Philippa moved the way high-minded womentended to move, like a swan taken to human form.“How may I be of service, Wizard Zorander?”“Zedd will do. Is this Prelate of yours awake?”“She is. This way, Zedd, if you please.”He fell in behind the woman as she glided off toward the dark shapes of tents.“Got anything to eat around here?”She looked back over her shoulder. “This late?”“Well, I’ve been traveling hard .... It’s not really all that late, is it?”In the dark, she assessed him briefly. “I don’t believe it’s ever too late,according to the teachings of the Creator. And you do look emaciated-from yourtravels, I’m sure.” Her smile warmed a little. “Food is always at the ready; wehave soldiers who are active through the night and need to be fed. I believe Icould find something for you.” She returned her gaze to the indiscernible path.“That would be a kindness,” Zedd said in a jovial voice as he scowled at herback. “And I’m not emaciated; I’m wiry. Most women find lean men appealing.”“Do they`? I never knew that.”Sisters of the Light were a lofty lot, Zedd thought ruefully. For thousands ofyears it had been a death sentence for them to even set foot in the New World.Zedd had always been a little more lenient-but not by much. In the past, theSisters only came into the New World to steal boys with the gift-they claimed tobe saving them. It was a wizard’s task to train wizards. If they came for thereason of taking a boy back beyond the great barrier to their palace, Zeddviewed it as the gravest of crimes.They had come for that very reason only the winter before, and taken Richard.Sister Verna was the one who had captured him and taken him to the Old World.Under the spell of their palace, he could have ended up being there forcenturies. Leave it to Richard to make friends with the Sisters of the Light, ofall people.Zedd guessed he and the Sisters were even-that they had good reason to view himin a harsh way. He had, after all, set the spell that Richard had used todestroy their palace. But Ann had helped, knowing it was the only way to preventJagang from capturing the palace and acquiring the prophecies therein for hisown purposes.All around, guards, big guards, prowled the encampment. In chain mail andleather armor, they were an imposing sight. They watched everything as theyslipped through the darkness. The camp was relatively quiet, considering itssize. Noise could give away a variety of information to an enemy. It was noteasy to see to it that this many men kept quiet.“I’m relieved that our first incursion by someone possessing the gift turned outto be a friend,” the Sister said.“And I’m glad to see that the gifted are helping to keep watch. But there aretypes of enemy forays that the regular sentries could not identify.” Zeddwondered if they were really prepared for those kinds of troubles.“If magic is involved, we will be there to detect it.”“I suppose you were watching me the whole time.”“I was,” Sister Philippa said. “From the time you crossed the line of hills,back there.”Zedd scratched his jaw. “Really? That far away.”With a satisfied smirk she said, “That far.”He peered over his shoulder into the night. “Both of you. Very good.”She halted and turned to him. “Both? You knew there were two of us, watching?”Zedd smiled innocently. “But, of course. You were just watching. She was fartheraway, following, conjuring some little nasty should I prove hostile.”Sister Philippa blinked in astonishment. “Remarkable. You could sense hertouching her Han? From that distance?”Zedd nodded with satisfaction. “They didn’t make me First Wizard just because Iwas wiry.”Sister Philippa’s smile finally looked sincere. “I am relieved you came as afriend, rather than one intent on harm.”There was more truth in that than the woman knew; Zedd had experience in theunpleasant, dirty business of magic in warfare. When he’d come near their camp,he saw the holes in their defense and the weaknesses in the way they used thegift for their purpose. They were not thinking as their enemy would think. Hadlie been intent on harm, the entire camp would be in an uproar by now, despitewhat they had done to prepare for one such as he.Sister Philippa turned back to the night to lead him on. It was somewhatunsettling for Zedd to walk through a D’Haran camp-even though he knew they werenow fighting on the same side. He had spent a good deal of his life dealing withD’Harans as the deadly enemy. Richard had changed all that. Zedd sighed. Hesometimes thought that Richard might make friends with thunder and lightning andinvite them both to dinner.Dark shapes of tents and wagons loomed all around. Pole weapons were stackedupright in neat ranks, ready, should they be suddenly needed. Some soldierssnored, and some sat around in the dark, talking in low voices or laughingquietly, while x others patrolled the inky shadows. Those passed close enoughfor Zedd to smell their breath, but in the darkness he could not make out theirfaces.Well-hidden sentries were stationed at every possible approach route. There werevery few fires in the camp, and those were mostly watch fires set away from themain force, leaving the mass of the camp a dark whole of night. Some armiescarried. on a considerable amount of work at night, performing repairs or makingthings . they needed, and letting the men do as they would. These men remainedquiet ; throughout the night so watching eyes and listening ears could gainlittle if any help , for an invading force. These were well trained,disciplined, professional soldiers. From a distance it was difficult to tell thesize of the camp. It was huge.Sister Philippa brought Zedd to a sizable tent, one tall enough to stand in.Light from lamps hanging inside gave the canvas walls and roof a soft amberglow. She ducked beneath a tent line and poked her head in under the flap.“I have a wizard out here who wishes to see the Prelate.”Zedd heard muffled, astonished acknowledgment from inside.“Go on in.” Sister Philippa smiled while giving his back a gentle push. “I’llsee if I can find you some dinner.”“I would be not only grateful, but greatly in your debt,” Zedd told her.As he stepped inside the tent, the people were just coming to their feet togreet him.“Zedd! You old fool! You be alive!”Zedd grinned as Adie, the old sorceress known as the bone woman in their adoptedhomeland of Westland, rushed into his arms. He let out a grunt as shemomentarily squeezed the wind from his lungs. He smoothed her square-cut, jawlength black and gray hair as he held her head to his chest.“I promised you’d see me again, now didn’t I?”“Yes, you did,” she whispered into his heavy robes.She pushed back, holding his arms, and looked him over. She reached up andsmoothed down his unruly, wavy white hair.“You look as lovely as ever,” he told her.She peered at him with her completely white eyes. Her sight had been taken fromher when she was but a young woman. Adie now saw by means of her gift. In someways, she saw better.“Where be your hat?”“Hat?”“I bought you a fine hat arid you lost it. I see you still have not replaced it.You told me you would get another. I believe you promised.”Zedd hated the hat with the long feather she’d bought for him when they’dacquired the rest of his clothes. He’d rather be wearing the simple robesbefitting a wizard of his rank and authority, but Adie had “lost” them after hepurchased the fancy maroon robes with black sleeves and cowled shoulders he nowwore. Three rows of silver brocade circled the cuffs. Thicker gold brocade ranaround the neck and down the front. A red satin belt set with a gold bucklegathered the outfit at his thin waist. Such clothes marked one with the gift asan initiate. For one without the gift, such clothes befitted nobility or in mostplaces a wealthy merchant, so although Zedd disliked the ostentatious attire, ithad at times been a valuable disguise. Besides, Adie liked him in the maroonrobes. The hat, though, was too much for him. It had been “misplaced.”He noted that Adie had managed to keep her simple clothes along the way. Yellowand real beads around the neck of her robes, sewn in the shapes of the ancientsymbols of her profession of sorceress, were the only ornamentation she wore.“I’ve been busy,” he said, flicking his hand, hoping to dismiss the matter, “orI would have replaced the hat.”“Bale,” she scoffed. “You be up to mischief.”“Why, I’ve been-”“Hush, now,” Adie said. Holding his arm in a tight grip, she held out the longthin fingers of her other hand. “Zedd, this be Verna: Prelate of the Sisters ofthe Light.”The woman looked to be in her late thirties, perhaps early forties; Zedd knewher to be much older. Ann, Verna’s predecessor, had told him Verna’s age, andwhile he couldn’t recall the exact number, it was somewhere close to one hundredand sixty years-young for a Sister of the Light. She had simple, attractivefeatures and brown hair with just enough curl and body to add a hint ofsophistication. Her intent, brown-eyed gaze looked as if it could scour lichenoff granite. By the lines of a resolute expression enduringly fixed on her face,she appeared to be a woman with a shell as tight as a beetle’s and just as hard.Zedd bowed his head. “Prelate. First Wizard Zeddicus Zu’l Zorander, at yourservice.” He let her know, by his tone, that it was merely a figure of speech.This was the woman who had taken Richard away to the Old World. Even if shebelieved it was to save his life, Zedd, as First Wizard, viewed such an act asabhorrent. The Sisters-sorceresses all-believed they could train gifted youngmen to be wizards. They were wrong; such a task could only be adequatelyaccomplished by another wizard.She offered her hand with the sunburst-patterned gold ring of office. He bentforward and kissed it out of what he thought must be their custom. She pulledhis hand close when he had finished, and kissed it in return.“I am humbled to meet the man who helped raise our Richard. You would have to beas rare a person as I found him to be when we helped begin his training.” Sheforced a chuckle. “We found it a formidable labor, trying to teach that grandsonof yours.”Zedd slightly altered his opinion of the woman, treating her with greatercaution. The air in the tent was stuffy and uncomfortable.“That is because you are all oxen trying to teach a horse to run. You Sistersshould stick to work more befitting your nature.”“Yes, yes, you be a brilliant man, Zedd,” Adie scoffed. “Simply brilliant. Oneof these days even I may come to believe you.” She tugged his sleeve, turninghim from Verna’s scarlet face. “And this be Warren,” Adie said.Zedd inclined his head toward Warren, but the boy was already falling to hisknees and bowing his blond head.“Wizard Zorander! This is quite an honor.” He popped back up and seized Zedd’shand in both of his, pumping it until Zedd thought his arm might come undone atthe shoulder. “I’m so pleased to meet you. Richard told me all about you. I’m sopleased to meet a wizard of your standing and talent. I would be so happy tolearn from you!”The happier he looked, the more Verna scowled.“Well, I’m pleased to meet you, too, my boy.” Zedd didn’t tell Warren thatRichard had never mentioned him. But that was not out of disrespect or neglect;Richard had never had a chance to tell Zedd a great number of very importantthings. Zedd thought he could sense through Warren’s grip that the young man wasa wizard of unusual talents.A bear of a man with a curly rust-colored beard, a white scar from his lefttemple to his jaw, and heavy eyebrows stepped forward. His grayish green eyesfixed on Zedd with fierce intensity, but he had a grin like a soldier on a longmarch who had spotted a lonely cask of ale.“General Reibisch, commander of the D’Haran forces here in the south,” the mansaid, taking Zedd’s hand when Warren at last surrendered it and stepped backbeside Verna. “Lord Rahl’s grandfather! What good fortune to see you, sir.” Hisgrip was firm, but not painful. It got tighter. “What very good fortune.”“Yes, indeed,” Zedd muttered. “Unfortunate as the circumstances are, GeneralReibisch.”“Unfortunate . . . ?”“Well, never mind, for the moment,” Zedd said, waving off the question. He askedanother, instead. “Tell me, General, have you begun to dig all the mass graves,yet? Or do you intend the few who are left alive to simply abandon all thebodies.”“Bodies?”“Why . . . yes, the bodies of all your troops who are going to die.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16“I hope you like eggs,” Sister Philippa sang out as she swept into the tent,holding out a steaming plate.Zedd rubbed his hands together. “Delightful!”Everyone else was still standing in stiff, stunned silence. Sister Philippadidn’t seem to notice all the hanging jaws.“I had the cook add some ham and a few other things he had about.” She glanceddown at Zedd’s form. “I thought you could use some substance.”“Marvelous!” Zedd grinned as he relieved her of the plate mounded high withscrambled eggs and ham.“Ah . . .” the general began, seemingly befuddled as to how to frame hisquestion, “might you kindly explain . . . what you mean by that, WizardZorander?”“Zedd will do.” Zedd looked up from inhaling the intoxicating aroma of the dish.“Dead.” He drew the fork across his throat. “You know, dead. Nearly all of them.Dead.” He turned back to Sister Philippa. “This smells delightful.” He againinhaled the steam lifting from the plate of eggs. “Simply delightful. You are awoman of a kind heart and a skillful mind, to think to have the cook add such asplendid complement of ingredients. Simply delightful.”The Sister beamed.The general lifted a hand. “Wizard Zorander, if I may-”Adie hushed the burly general. “You be poor competition to food. Be patient.”Zedd took a forkful, humming his pleasure at the flavor he encountered. As hetook a second forkful, Adie guided him to a simple bench at the side of thetent. A table in the middle held a few mugs and a lamp that lent the cozy tentnot only its light but its oily odor as well.Despite Adie’s advice to be patient, everyone began talking at once, askingquestions and offering objections. Zedd ignored them as he shoveled in thescrambled eggs. The large chunks of ham were delicious. He waved a particularjuicy piece of meat to the confounded spectators to indicate his pleasure withit. The spices, the onions, the peppers, and the warm lumps of cheese weredelightful. He rolled his eyes and moaned in bliss.It was the best food he’d had in days. His traveling rations were simple and hadlong ago become boring. He had often grumbled that Spider ate better than hedid. Spider seemed smug about it, too, which he had always found annoying. Itwasn’t good for a horse to be smug with you.“Philippa,” Verna growled, “must you be so pleased about a plate of eggs?”“Well the poor man is practically starving.” Puzzled by Verna’s scowl, shewaggled her hand at Zedd. “Just look at him. I’m simply happy to see him enjoyhis meal, and pleased I could help one of the Creator’s gifted.”Zedd slowed when he all too soon approached the end of his meal, putting off thelast few bites. He could have eaten another plate the same size. GeneralReibisch, sitting on a bench on the opposite side of the small tent, had beenfuriously twisting a strand of beard. Now, he leaned forward, his intent gazefixed on Zedd.“Wizard Zorander, I need-”“Zedd. Remember?”“Yes, Zedd. Zedd, the lives of these soldiers are my responsibility. Could youplease tell me if you think they are in danger?”Zedd spoke around a mouthful. “I already did.”“But . . . what is the nature of the danger?”“The gifted. You know, magic.”The general straightened with a sober expression. His fingers dug into hismuscular thighs. “The gifted?”“Yes. The enemy has gifted among them. I thought you knew.”He blinked a few times as he seemed to run it through his mind again, trying todiscover the nugget of invisible danger in Zedd’s simple statement.“Of course we know that.”“Ah. Then why haven’t you dug some mass graves?”Verna shot to her feet. “In the name of Creation! What do you think we are,serving wenches? Here to bring you dinner? We are gifted Sisters, here to defendthe army from Jagang’s captive Sisters!”Adie stealthily signaled Verna to sit down and keep quiet. Her voice came outlike gravel in honey. “Why don’t you tell us what you have found, Zedd? I besure the general and the Prelate would like to hear how to improve ourdefenses.”Zedd scraped the small yellow lumps across the plate, collecting them into afinal, pitifully small forkful. “Prelate, I didn’t mean to imply a deliberateinadequacy on your part.”“Well you certainly didn’t.”“You are all too good, that’s all.”“I beg your pardon?”“Too good. You and your Sisters have spent your lives trying to help people.”“Well . . . I, we-why, of course we help people. That’s our calling.”“Killing is not. Jagang will be intent on killing you all.”“We know that, Zedd.” The general scratched his beard, his gaze darting back andforth between Verna and Zedd. “The Prelate and her Sisters have helped us withdetecting a number of enemy scouts and such. Just the same as Sister Philippa,here, found you when you approached our camp, they’ve found others intent onharm. They’ve done their part, Zedd, and without complaint. Every soldier inthis camp is glad to have them here.”“All well and good, but when the army of the Imperial Order attacks, it will bedifferent. They will use the gifted to lay waste to your forces.”“They will try,” Verna insisted, trying to be convincing without shouting, whichshe was clearly itching to do, “but we are prepared to prevent such a thing.”“That’s right,” Warren said, nodding his confidence. “We have gifted at theready at all times.”“That’s good, that’s good,” Zedd drawled, as if he might be reconsidering. “Thenyou have dealt with the simple threats. The albino mosquitoes and such.”General Reibisch’s bushy eyebrows wrinkled together. “The what?”Zedd waved his fork. “So, tell me, then just to satisfy my curiosity-what arethe gifted planning to do when the enemy charges our forces? Say, with a line ofcavalry?”“Lay down a line of fire before their cavalry,” Warren said without hesitation.“As they charge in, we’ll incinerate them before they can so much as launch aspear.”“Ah,” Zedd said. “Fire.” He put the last forkful in his mouth. Everyone silentlywatched him chew. He paused in his chewing and looked up. “Big fire, I presume?Colossal gouts of flame, and all?”“What mosquitoes is he talking about,” General Reibisch muttered under hisbreath toward Verna and Warren beside him on his bench opposite Zedd and Adie.“That’s right,” Verna said, ignoring the general. He sighed and folded his armsacross his barrel chest. “A proper line of fire.” Verna waited until Zeddswallowed. “Do you find something unsatisfactory about that, First Wizard?”Zedd shrugged. “Well . . .” He paused, then frowned. He leaned toward thegeneral, peering more closely. Zedd wagged a bony finger at the man’s foldedarms.“There’s one now. A mosquito is about to suck your blood, General.”“What? Oh.” He swatted it. “They’ve been thick this summer. I think the seasonfor them is drawing to an end, though. We’ll be happy to be rid of the littlepests, I can tell you.”Zedd waggled his finger again. “And were they all like that one’?”General Reibisch lifted his forearm and glanced down at the squashed bug. “Yes,the bloodthirsty little . . .” His voice trailed off. He peered more closely.With a finger and thumb he gingerly lifted the tiny insect by a wing, holding itup to have a better look.“Well I’ll be . . . this thing is”-his face lost a shade of color-”white.” Hisgrayish-green eyes turned up toward Zedd. “What was that you were saying about .. . ?”“Albino mosquitoes,” Zedd confirmed as he set his empty plate on the ground. Hegestured with a sticklike finger at the general’s flat assailant. “Have you everseen the albino fever, General? Have any of you? Terrible thing, albino fever.”“What’s albino fever?” Warren asked. “I never heard of it. I’ve never readanything about it, either, I’m sure.”“Really? Must be just a Midlands thing.”The general peered more closely at the tiny white insect he was holding up.“What does this albino fever do to a person?”“Oh, your flesh turns the most ghastly white.” Zedd waved his fork. “Do youknow,” he said, frowning in thought as if distracted by something as he lookingup at the ceiling of the tent, “that I once saw a wizard lay down a simplyprodigious font of flame before a line of charging cavalry?”“Well, there you go,” Verna said. “You know its value, then. You’ve seen it inaction.”“Yes . . .” Zedd drawled. “Problem was, the enemy had been prepared for such asimpleminded trick.”“Simpleminded!” Verna shot to her feet. “I don’t see how you could possiblyconsider-”“The enemy had conjured curved shields just for such an eventuality.”“Curved shields?” Warren swiped back a curly lock of his blond hair. “I’ve neverheard of such a thing. What are curved-’“The wizard who laid down the fire had been expecting shields, of course, and sohe made his fire resistant to such an expected defense. These shields, though,weren’t conjured to stop the fire”-Zedd’s gaze. shifted from Warren’s wide eyesto Verna’s scowl-”but to roll it.”“Albino fever?” The general waved his bug. “If you might, could you explain-”“Roll the fire?” Warren asked as he leaned forward.“Yes,” Zedd said. “Roll the fire before the cavalry charge-so that instead of asimple cavalry assault, the defenders now had deadly fire rolling back at them.”“Dear Creator . . .” Warren whispered. “That’s ingenious-but surely the shieldwould extinguish the fire.”Zedd twirled his fork as he spoke, as if to demonstrate the shield rolling theflames. “Conjured by their own wizard for the expected defense, the fire hadbeen hardened against shields, so instead of fizzling, it stayed viable. That,of course, enabled the curved shield to roll the fire back without itextinguishing. And, of course, being hardened to shields, the wizard’s ownquickly thrown up defensive shields couldn’t stop his own fire’s return.”“But he could just cut it oft!” Warren was becoming panicked, as if seeing hisown wizard’s fire coming back at him. “The wizard who created it could call itand cut it off.”“Could he?” Zedd smiled. “He thought so, too, but he hadn’t been prepared forthe peculiar nature of the enemy’s shield. Don’t you see? It not only rolled thefire back, but in so doing rolled around the fire as it went, protecting it fromany alteration by magic.”“Of course . . .” Warren whispered to himself.“The shield was also sprinkled with a provenance-seeking spell, so it rolled thefire back toward the wizard who conjured it. He died by his own fire-after ithad seared through hundreds of his own men on its way to him.”Silence settled into the tent. Even the general, still holding out the albinomosquito, sat transfixed.“You see,” Zedd finally went on, tossing his fork down onto his plate, “usingthe gift in war is not simply an act of exercising your power, but an act ofusing your wits.”Zedd pointed. “For example, consider that albino mosquito General Reibisch isholding. Under cover of darkness, just like right now, tens of thousands ofthem, conjured by the enemy, could be sneaking into this camp to infect your menwith fever, and no one would even realize they were under attack. Then, in themorning, the enemy strikes a camp of weak and sick soldiers and slaughters thelot of you.”Sister Philippa, over on the other side of Adie, swished her hand in alarm at atiny buzzing mosquito. “But, the gifted we have could counter such a thing.” Itwas more a plea than an argument.“Really? It’s difficult to detect such an infinitesimal bit of magic. None ofyou detected these minuscule invaders, did you?”“Well, no, but . . .”Zedd fixed a fierce glare on Sister Philippa. “It’s night. In the night, theysimply seem to be ordinary mosquitoes, pesky, but no different from any other.Why, the general here didn’t notice them. Neither did any of you gifted people.You can’t detect the fever they carry, either, because it, too, is such a tinyspeck of magic you aren’t watching for it-you’re looking for something huge andpowerful and fearsome.“Most of the gifted Sisters will be bitten in their sleep, without ever knowingit happened, until they awake in the pitch blackness with the shivering chillsof a frightful fever, only to discover the first truly debilitating symptom ofthis particular fever: blindness. You see, it isn’t the blackness of night theyawake to-dawn has already broken-but blindness. Then they find that their legswon’t obey their wishes. Their ears are ringing with what sounds like anendless, tingling scream.”The general’s gaze darted about, testing his eyesight as Zedd went on. He.twisted a big finger in an ear as if to clean it out.“By now, anyone bitten is too weak to stand. They lose control of their bodilyfunctions and lie helpless in their own filth. They are within hours of death .. . but those last hours will seem like a year.”“How do we counter it?” On the edge of his seat, Warren licked his lips. “What’sthe cure?”“Cure? There is no cure! Now a fog is beginning to creep toward the camp. Thistime, the few gifted left can sense that the wide mass of seething murk is foulwith dark, suffocating magic. They warn everyone. Those too sick to stand wailin terror. They can’t see, but they can hear the distant battle cries of theadvancing enemy. In a panic not to be touched by the deadly fog, anyone able torise from their bedrolls does so. Too delirious to stand, a few manage to crawl.The rest run for their lives before the advancing fog.“It’s the last mistake they ever make,” Zedd whispered. He swept a hand outbefore their white faces. “They run headlong into the horror of a waiting deathtrap. “Everyone was wide-eyed and slack-jawed by now, sitting on the edge of theirbenches.“So, General,” Zedd said in a bright, cheery tone as he sat back, “what aboutthose mass graves? Or are you planning on any of you left alive just abandoningthe sick for dead and leaving the bodies to rot? Probably not a bad idea. Therewill be enough to worry about without the burdensome task of trying to care forthe dying and burying all the dead-especially since the very act of touchingtheir white flesh will contaminate the living with a completely unexpectedsickness, and then-”Verna shot to her feet. “But what can we do!” She could plainly see thepotential for chaos all around her. “How can we counter such vile magic?” Shethrew open her arms. “What do we need to do?”Zedd shrugged. “I thought you and your Sisters had it all figured out. I thoughtyou knew what you were doing.” He waggled his hand over his shoulder, gesturingoff to the south, toward the enemy. “I thought you said you had the situationwell in hand.”Verna silently sank back down to the bench beside Warren.“Uh, Zedd . . .” General Reibisch swallowed in distress. He held out themosquito. “Zedd, I think I’m starting to feel dizzy. Isn’t there anything youcan do?”“About what?”“The fever. I think my vision is getting dimmer. Can you do nothing?”“No, nothing.”“Nothing.”“Nothing, because there’s nothing wrong with you. I just conjured a few albinomosquitoes to make a point. The point is that what I saw when I came into thiscamp scared the wits out of me. If the gifted among the enemy are at alldiabolical, and with Jagang we have ample reason to believe they are, then thisarmy is ill prepared for the true nature of the threat.”Sister Philippa haltingly lifted a hand like a schoolgirl with a question. “But,with all the gifted among us, surely, we would . . . know . . . or something.”“That’s what I’m trying to tell you: the way things are now, you won’t know.It’s the things you never heard of, haven’t seen before, don’t expect, and can’teven imagine, that are going to be coming for you. The enemy will useconventional magic, to be sure, and that will be trouble enough, but it’s thealbino mosquitoes you must fear.”“As you said, though, you only conjured them to make a point,” Warren said.“Maybe the enemy isn’t as smart as you, and won’t think of such things.”“The Order did not take over all of the Old World by being stupid but by beingruthless.” Zedd’s brow drew lower. He lifted a finger skyward to mark his words.“Besides, they have already thought of just such things. This past spring, oneof the Sisters in the hands of the enemy used magic to unleash a deadly plaguethat could not be detected by anyone with the gift. Tens of thousands of people,from newborn infants to the old, suffered gruesome deaths.”Those Sisters, in the hands of the enemy, were a grave and ever-present danger.Ann had gone off alone on a mission to either rescue those Sisters or eliminatethem. From what Zedd had seen when he had been down in Anderith, Ann had failedin her mission. He didn’t know what had become of her, but he knew that Jagangstill held Sisters captive.“But we stopped the plague,” Warren said.“Richard stopped it, as only he could.” Zedd held the gaze of the young wizard.“Did you know that in order to save us from that grim fate, he had to venture tothe Temple of the Winds, hidden away beyond the veil of life in the underworlditself? Neither you nor I can imagine the toll such an experience must havetaken on him. I saw a shadow of the specter in his eyes when he spoke of it.”“I can’t even hazard a guess as to how trifling a chance at success he had whenhe started on so hopeless a journey. Had he not prevailed against all odds, wewould all be dead by now from an unseen death brought on by magic we could notdetect and could not counter. I’d not want to again count on such an auspiciousdeliverance.”No one could disagree with him; they nodded slightly, or looked away. The tenthad become a gloomy place.Verna rubbed her fingers across her brow. “Pride is of no use to the dead. Iadmit it: those gifted among us have little knowledge of what we’re doing whenit comes to using our gift in warfare. We know some things about fighting,perhaps even a great many things, but I admit we could be woefully lacking inthe depth of knowledge needed. “Think us fools if you will, but don’t ever thinkus at odds with you, Zedd; we are all here on the same side.” Her brown eyesbetrayed nothing but simple sincerity. “We not only could use your help, wewould gratefully welcome it.”“Of course he will help us,” Adie scoffed while giving Zedd a scolding frown.“Well, you have a good start. Admitting that you don’t know something is thefirst step to learning.” Zedd scratched his chin. “Every day, I amaze myselfwith all I don’t know.”“That would be wonderful,” Warren said. “If you would help us, I mean.” Hesounded hesitant, but forged ahead anyway. “I would really like to have thebenefit of a real wizard’s experience.”Despondent with the weight of his other troubles, Zedd shook his head. “I wouldlike to-and to be sure I will give you all some advice in the task at hand.However, I’ve been on a long and frustrating journey, and I’m afraid I’m not yetfinished with it. I can’t stay. I must soon be off again.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17Warren swiped back his curly blond hair. “What sort of journey have you been on,Zedd?”Zedd pointed a bony finger. “You don’t need to keep that flattened mosquito,General.”General Reibisch realized it was still between his finger and thumb. He tossedit away. Everyone awaited Zedd’s words. He smoothed the heavy maroon robes overhis twiglike thighs as his gaze absently studied the dirt floor.He let out a crestfallen sigh. “I was recovering from my own auspiciousdeliverance from grappling with remarkable magic I’d never before encountered,and, as I regained my senses, spent months searching. I was down in Anderith,and saw some of what happened after the Order swept in there. It was a dark timefor the people. Not only from the rampaging soldiers, but also from one of yourSisters, Verna. Death’s Mistress they called her.”“Do you know which one it is?” Verna asked in a bitter voice at hearing of aSister causing harm.“No. I only saw her once, from a goodly distance. Had I been fully recovered, Imight have tried to remedy the situation, but I wasn’t myself yet and dared notconfront her. She also had a few thousand soldiers with her. The sight of allthe soldiers, led by a woman they had heard of and feared, had people in apanic. The Sister was young, with blond hair. She wore a black dress.”“Dear Creator,” Verna whispered. “Not one of mine-one of the Keeper’s. There arefew women born with the strength of power such as she has. She also has poweracquired by nefarious means; Nicci is a Sister of the Dark.”“I’ve gotten reports,” General Reibisch said. By his grim tone, Zedd knew thereports must have had it right. “I’ve heard, too, that it’s quietedconsiderably.”Zedd nodded. “The Order was at first brutal, but now ‘Jagang the Just’-as theyhave taken to calling him-has spared them further harm. In most places, otherthan the capital of Fairfield where the most killing took place, people haveturned to supporting him as a liberator come to deliver them into a better life.They’re reporting neighbors, or travelers-whoever they suspect is not anadherent to the noble ideals of the Order.“I was all through Anderith, and spent a good deal of time behind the enemylines searching-without success. I then journeyed up into the wilds and north toa number of towns, and even a few cities, but I can find no sign of them. Iguess my abilities were a long time in recovering; I only a short time agodiscovered where you all were. I have to commend you, General, you’ve kept thepresence of your forces well hidden-took me forever to find your army. The boy,though, seems to have vanished without a trace.” Zedd’s fists tightened in hislap. “I must find him.”“You mean Richard?” Adie asked. “You be searching for your grandson?”“Yes. For Richard and Kahlan, both.” Zedd lifted his hands in a helplessgesture. “However, without any success, I must admit. I’ve talked to no one whohas seen even a sign of them. I’ve used every skill I possess, but to no avail.If I didn’t know better, I’d say they no longer existed.”Looks passed among everyone else. Zedd peered from one surprised face toanother. For the first time in months, Zedd’s hopes rose. “What? What is it? Youknow something?”Verna gestured under the bench. “Show him, General.”At her urging, the general lifted out a map roll. He pulled it wide in hiscallused hands and laid it on the ground at his feet. The map was turned aroundso Zedd could read it. General Reibisch tapped the mountains to the west ofHartland.“Right here, Zedd.”“Right there . . . what?”“Richard and Kahlan,” Verna said.Zedd gaped at her face and then down at the map. General Reibisch’s fingerhovered over a wild range of peaks. Zedd knew those mountains. They were aninhospitable place.“There? Dear spirits, why would Richard and Kahlan be all the way up there insuch a forbidding place? What are they doing there?”“Kahlan be hurt,” Adie said in a consoling tone.”“Hurt?”“She was at the brink of passing into the spirit world. From what we be told,maybe she saw the world on the other side of the veil.” Adie pointed to the map,“Richard took her there to recover.”“But . . . why would he do that?” With a hand, Zedd flattened his wavy whitehair to the top of his head. His thoughts spun in a confusing jumble while hetried to take it all in at once. “She could be healed.”“No. She be spelled. If magic be used to try to heal her, a vile hidden spellwould be unleashed and she would die.”Understanding washed over him. “Dear spirits . . . I’m thankful the boy knew itin time.” Before the horror of memories of the screams could come roaring to thefore of his thoughts, Zedd slammed a mental door on them. He swallowed with thepain of those that slipped through. “But still, why would he go there? He’sneeded here.”“He certainly is,” Verna snapped. By her tone, it was a sore subject.“He can’t come here,” Warren said. When Zedd only stared at him, he explainedfurther. “We don’t understand it all, but we believe Richard is following aprophecy of some sort.”“Prophecy!” Zedd dismissed it with a wave. “Richard doesn’t take to riddles, Hehates them and won’t pay heed to them. There are times when I wish he would buthe won’t.”“Well, this one he’s paying heed to.” Warren pressed his lips tight for amoment. “It’s his own.”“His own . . . what?”Warren cleared his throat. “Prophecy.”Zedd jumped to his feet. “What! Richard? Nonsense.”“He’s a war wizard,” Verna said with quiet authority.Zedd passed a scowl among all the suddenly circumspect expressions. He made asour face and, with a flourish of his robes, returned to his seat beside Adie.“What is this prophecy?”Warren twisted a little knot of his violet robes. “He didn’t say, exactly.”“Here.” General Reibisch pulled some folded papers from a pocket. “He wrote meletters. We’ve all read them.”Zedd stood and snatched the letters from the general’s big fist. He went to thetable and smoothed out the pages. As everyone else sat silently watching, Zeddleaned over the table and read Richard’s words lying before him.With great authority, Richard paradoxically turned away from authority. He saidthat after much reflection, he had come to an understanding that arrived withthe power of a vision, and he knew then, beyond doubt, that his help would onlybring about certain catastrophe.In letters that followed, Richard said he and Kahlan were safe and she wasslowly recovering. Cara was with them. In response to letters General Reibischand others had written, Richard remained steadfast in his stand. He warned themthat the cause of freedom would be forever lost if he failed to remain on histrue path. He said that whatever decisions General Reibisch and the rest of themmade, he would not contradict or criticize. He told them that his heart was withthem, but they were on their own for the foreseeable future. He said possiblyforever.His letters basically gave no real information, other than alluding to hisunderstanding or vision, and making it clear that they could expect no guidancefrom him. Nonetheless, Zedd could read some of what the words didn’t say.Zedd stared at the letters long after he had finished reading them. The flame ofthe lamp wavered slowly from side to side, occasionally fluttering and sendingup a coiled thread of oily smoke. He could hear muffled voices outside the tentas soldiers on patrol quietly passed along information. Inside, everyoneremained silent. They had all read the letters.Verna’s expression was tight with anxiety. She could hold her tongue no longer.“Will you go to see him, Zedd? Convince him to return to the struggle?”Zedd lightly trailed his fingers over the words on paper. “I can’t. This is onetime I can be of no help to him.”“But he’s our leader in this struggle.” The soft lamplight illuminated thefeminine grace of her slender fingers as she pressed them to her brow in vainsolace. Her hand fell back to her lap. “Without him . . .”Zedd didn’t answer her. He could not imagine what Ann’s reaction to such adevelopment would be. For centuries she had combed through prophecies inanticipation of the war wizard who would be born to lead them in this battle forthe very existence of magic. Richard was that war wizard, born to the battle hehad suddenly abandoned.“What do you think be the problem?” Adie asked in her quiet, raspy voice.Zedd looked back to the letters one last time. He pulled his gaze from the wordsand straightened. All eyes around the dimly lit tent were on him as if hoping hecould somehow rescue them from a fate they couldn’t comprehend, butinstinctively dreaded.“This is a time of trial to the depth of Richard’s soul.” Zedd slipped his handsup opposite sleeves until the silver brocade at the cuffs met. “A passage, ofsorts thrust upon him because of his comprehension of something only he sees.”Warren cleared his throat. “What sort of trial, Zedd? Can you tell us?”Zedd gestured vaguely as memories of terrible times flashed through his mind. “Astruggle . . . a reconciliation . . .”“What sort of reconciliation?” Warren pressed.Zedd gazed into the young man’s blue eyes, wishing he wouldn’t ask so manyquestions. “What is the purpose of your gift?”“Its purpose? Well, I ability.”“It is to help others,” Verna stated flatly. She clutched her light blue cloakmore tightly around her shoulders as if it were armor to defend her fromwhatever Zedd might throw at her in answer.“Ah. Then what are you doing here?”The question caught her by surprise. “Here?”“Yes.” Zedd waved his arm, indicating a vague, distant place. “If the gift is tohelp others, then why are you not out there doing it? There are sick needing tobe healed, ignorant needing to be taught, and the hungry needing to be fed. Whyare you just sitting there, healthy, smart, and well fed?”Verna rearranged her cloak as she squared her shoulders into a posture of firmresolve. “In battle, if you abandon the gates to help a fallen comrade, you havegiven in to a weakness: your inability to steel yourself to an immediatesuffering in order to prevent suffering on a much greater scale. If I run off tohelp the few people I could in that manner, I must leave my post here, with thisarmy, as they try to keep the enemy from storming the gateway into the NewWorld.”Zedd’s estimation of the woman rose a little. She had come tantalizingly closeto expressing the essence of a vital truth. He offered her a small smile ofrespect as he nodded. She looked more surprised by that than she had by hisquestion.“I can certainly see why the Sisters of the Light are widely regarded as properservants of need.” Zedd stroked his chin. “So then, it is your conviction thatwe with the ability-the gift-are born into the world to be slaves to those withneeds?”“Well, no . . . but if there is a great need-”“Then we are more tightly bound in the chains of slavery to those with everygreater need,” Zedd finished for her. “Thus, anyone with a need, by right-toyour mind-becomes our master? Indentured servant to one cause, or to any greatercause that might come along, but chattel all the same. Yes?”This time, Verna chose not to dance with him over what she apparently regardedas a patch of quicksand. It didn’t prevent her from glaring at him, though.Zedd held that there could be only one philosophically valid answer to thequestion; if Verna knew it, she didn’t offer it.“Richard has apparently come to a place where he must critically examine hisalternatives and determine the proper course of his life,” Zedd explained.“Perhaps circumstances have caused him to question the proper use of hisabilities, and, in view of his values, his true purpose.”Verna opened her hands in a helpless gesture. “I don’t see how he could have anyhigher purpose than to be here, helping the army against the threat to the NewWorld-the threat to the lives of free people.”Zedd sank back down onto the bench. “You do not see, and I do not see, butRichard sees something.”“That doesn’t mean he’s right,” Warren said.Zedd studied the young man’s face for a moment. Warren had fresh features, butguess to . . . well, it just is. The gift was simply an also a knowing look inhis eyes that betrayed something beyond mere youth. Zedd wondered how old Warrenwas.“No, it does not mean Richard is right. He may be making a heroic mistake thatdestroys our chance to survive.”“Kahlan thinks maybe it be a mistake,” Adie finally put in, as if regrettinghaving to tell him. “She wrote a note to me-I believe without Richard’sknowledge, seeing as Cara wrote down Kahlan’s words for her-and gave it to themessenger. Kahlan says that she fears Richard be doing this in part because ofwhat happened to her. The Mother Confessor also confided that she be afraidRichard has lost his faith in people, and, because of his rejection by thepeople of Anderith, Richard may view himself as a fallen leader.”“Bah.” Zedd waved his hand dismissively. “A leader cannot follow behind people,tail between his legs, sniffing for their momentary whims and wishes, whining tofollow them this way and that as they ramble through life. Those kind of peopleare not looking for a leader-they are looking for a master, and one will findthem.“A true leader forges a clear path through a moral wilderness so that peoplemight see the way. Richard was a woods guide because such is his nature. Perhapshe is lost in that dark wood. If he is, he must find his way out, and it must bea correctly reasoned course, if he is to be the true leader of a free people.”Everyone silently considered the implications. The general was a man whofollowed the Lord Rahl, and simply awaited his orders. The Sisters had their ownideas. Zedd and Adie knew the way ahead was not what it might seem to some.“That’s what Richard did for me,” Warren said in a soft voice, staring off intomemories of his own. “He showed me the way-made me want to follow him up out ofthe vaults. I had become comfortable down there, content with my books and myfate, but I was a prisoner of that darkness, living my life through thestruggles and accomplishments of others. I never could understand precisely howhe inspired me to want to follow him up and out.” Warren looked up into Zedd’seyes. “Maybe he needs that same kind of help, himself. Can you help him, Zedd?”“He has entered a dark time for any man, and especially for a wizard. He mustcome out the other side of this on his own. If I take him by the hand and leadhim through, so to speak, I might take him a way he would not have selected onhis own, and then he would forever be crippled by what I had chosen for him .. . . But worse yet, what if he’s right? If I unwittingly forced him to anothercourse, it could doom us all and result in a world enslaved by the ImperialOrder.” Zedd shook his head. “No. This much I know: Richard must be left aloneto do as he must. If he truly is the one to lead us in this battle for thefuture of magic and of mankind, then this can only be part of his journey as itmust be traveled.”Almost everyone nodded, if reluctantly, at Zedd’s words.Warren didn’t nod. He picked at the fabric of his violet robes. “There’s onething we haven’t considered.” As everyone waited, his blue eyes turned up tomeet Zedd’s gaze. In those eyes, Zedd saw an uncommon wisdom that told him thatthis was a young man who could gaze into the depths of things when most peoplesaw only the sparkles on the surface.“It could be,” Warren said in a quiet but unflinching voice, “that Richard,being gifted, and being a war wizard, has been visited by a legitimate prophecy.War wizards are different from the rest of us. Their ability is not narrowlyspecific, but broad. Prophecy is, at least theoretically, within his purview.Moreover, Richard has Subtractive Magic as well as Additive. No wizard born inthe last three thousand years has had both sides. While we can perhaps imagine,we could not possibly begin to understand his potential, though the prophecieshave alluded to it.“It could very well be that Richard has had a valid prophecy that he clearlyunderstands. If so, then he may be doing precisely what must be done. It couldeven be that he clearly understands the prophecy and it is so gruesome he isdoing us the only kindness he can-by not telling us.”Verna covered his hand with hers. “You don’t really believe that, do you,Warren?” Zedd noticed that Verna put a lot of stock in what Warren said.Ann had told Zedd that Warren was only beginning to exhibit his gift ofprophecy. Such wizards-prophets-were so rare that they came along only once ortwice a millennium. The potential importance of such a wizard was incalculable.Zedd didn’t know how far along that path Warren really was, yet. Warren probablydidn’t, either.“Prophecy can be a terrible burden.” Warren smoothed his robes along his thigh.“Perhaps Richard’s prophecy told him that if he is to ever have a chance tooversee victory, he must not die with the rest of us in our struggle against thearmy of the Imperial Order.”General Reibisch, silent about such wizardly doings, had nevertheless beenlistening and watching intently. Sister Philippa’s thumb twiddled a button onher dress. Even with Verna’s comforting hand on his, Warren, at that moment,looked nothing but forlorn.“Warren”-Zedd waited until their eyes met-”we all at times envision the mostfearful turn of events, simply because it’s the most frightening thing we canimagine. Don’t invest your thoughts primarily in that which is not the mostlikely reason for Richard’s actions, simply because it is the reason you fearthe most. I believe Richard is struggling to understand his place in all this.Remember, he grew up as a woods guide. He has to come to terms not only with hisability, but with the weight of rule.”“Yes, but-”Zedd lifted a finger for emphasis. “The truth of a situation most often turnsout to be that one with the simplest explanation.”The gloom on Warren’s face finally melted away under the dawning radiance of aluminous smile. “I’d forgotten that ancient bit of wisdom. Thank you, Zedd.”General Reibisch, combing his curly beard with his fingers, pulled the hand freeand made a fist. “Besides, D’Harans will not be so easily bested. We have moreforces to call upon, and we have allies here in the Midlands who will come toaid in the fight. We have all heard the reports of the size of the Order, butthey are just men, not evil spirits. They have gifted, but so do we. They haveyet to come faceto-face with the might of D’Haran soldiers.”Warren picked up a small rock, not quite the size of his fist, and held it inhis palm as he spoke. “I mean no disrespect, General, and I do not mean todissuade you from our just cause, but the subject of the Order has been apastime of mine. I’ve studied them for years. I’m also from the Old World.”“Fair enough. So what is it you have to tell us?”“Well, say that the tabletop is the Old World-the area from which Jagang drawshis troops. Now, there are places, to be sure, where there are few people spreadover vast areas. But there are many places with great populations, too.”“It’s much the same in the New World,” the general said. “D’Hara has populousplaces, and desolate areas.”Warren shook his head. He passed his hand over the tabletop. “Say this is theOld World-the whole of this table.” He held up the rock to show the general andthen placed it on the edge of the tabletop. “This is the New World. This is itssize-this rock--compared to the Old World.”“But, but, that doesn’t include D’Hara,” General Reibisch sputtered. “Surely . .. with D’Hara-”“D’Hara is included in the rock.”“I’m afraid Warren is right,” Verna said.Sister Philippa, too, nodded grim acknowledgment. “Perhaps . . .” she said,looking down at her hands folded in her lap, “perhaps Warren is right, andRichard has seen a vision of our defeat, and knows he must remain out of it, orbe lost with all the rest of us.”“I don’t think that’s it at all,” Zedd offered in a gentle voice. “I knowRichard. If Richard thought we would lose, he would say so in order to givepeople a chance to weigh that in their decisions.”The general cleared his throat. “Well, actually, one of the letters is missingfrom that stack. It was the first-where Lord Rahl told me about his vision. Init, Lord Rahl did say that we had no chance to win.”Zedd felt the blood drain down into his legs. He tried to keep his mannerunconcerned. “Oh? Where is the letter?”The general gave Verna a sidelong glance.“Well, actually,” Verna said, “when I read it, I was angered and . . .”“And she balled it up and threw it in the fire,” Warren finished for her.Verna’s face turned red, but she offered no defense. Zedd could understand thesentiment, but he would have liked to have read it with his own eyes. He forceda smile.“Were those his actual words-that we had no chance to win?” Zedd asked, tryingnot to sound alarmed. He could feel sweat running down the back of his neck.“No . . .” General Reibisch said as he shifted his shoulders inside his uniformwhile giving the question careful thought. “No, Lord Rahl’s words were that wemust not commit our forces to an attack directly against the army of theImperial Order, or our side will be destroyed and any chance for winning in thefuture will be forever lost.”The feeling began to return to Zedd’s fingers. He wiped a bead of sweat from theside of his forehead. He was able to draw an easier breath. “Well, that onlymakes sense. If they are as large a force as Warren says, then any direct attackwould be foolhardy.”It did make sense. Zedd wondered, though, why Richard would make such a point ofit to a man of General Reibisch’s experience. Perhaps Richard was only beingcautious. There was nothing wrong with being cautious.Adie slipped her hand under Zedd’s and cuddled her loose fist under his palm.“If you believe you must let Richard be in this, then you will stay? Help teachthe gifted here what they must know?”Every face was etched with concern as they watched him, hanging on what he mightdecide. The general idly stroked a finger down the white scar on the side of hisface. Sister Philippa knitted her fingers together. Verna and Warren entwinedtheirs.Zedd smiled and hugged Adie’s shoulders. “Of course I’m not going to abandonyou.”The three on the bench opposite him each let out a little sigh. Their posturerelaxed as if ropes around their necks had been slackened.Zedd passed a hard look among them all. “War is nasty business. It’s aboutkilling people before they can kill you. Magic in war is simply another weapon,if a frightening one. You must realize that it, too, in this, must be used forthe end result of killing people.”“What do we need to do?” Verna asked, clearly relieved that he had agreed tostay, but not to the obvious extent of General Reibisch, Warren, or SisterPhilippa.Zedd pulled some of his robes from each side of his legs over into the middle,between them, as he gave the question some thought. It was not the sort oflesson he relished.“Tomorrow morning, we will begin. There is much to learn about countering magicin warfare. I will teach all the gifted some things about the awful business ofusing what you always hoped to use for good, for harm, instead. The lessons arenot pleasing to endure, but then, neither is the alternative.”The thought of such lessons, and worse, the use of such knowledge, could not bepleasant for any of them to contemplate. Adie, who knew a little bit about thehorrific nature of such struggle, rubbed his back in sympathy. His heavy robesstuck to his skin. He wished he had his simple wizard’s robes back.“We will all do as we must to prevent our own people from falling to themonstrous magic of the Imperial Order,” Verna said. “You have my word asPrelate.”Zedd nodded. “Tomorrow, then, we begin.”“I fear to think of magic added to warfare,” General Reibisch said as he stood.Zedd shrugged. “To tell the truth, the ultimate object of magic in warfare is tocounter the enemy’s magic. If we do our job properly, we will bring balance tothis. That would mean that all magic would be nullified and the soldiers wouldthen be able to fight without magic swaying the battle. You will be able to bethe steel against steel, while we are the magic against magic.”“You mean, your magic won’t be of direct help to us?”Zedd shrugged. “We will try to use magic to visit harm on them in any way wecan, but when we try to use magic as a weapon, the enemy will try to counterours. Any attempt to use their power against us, we will try to counter. Theresult of magic in warfare, if properly and expertly done, is that it seems asif magic did not exist at all.“If we fail to rise to the challenge, then the power they throw at us will betruly horrific to witness. If we can best them, then you will see suchdestruction of their forces as you can’t imagine. But, in my experience, magichas a way of balancing, so that you rarely see such events.”“A deadlock, then, is our goal?” Sister Philippa asked.Zedd turned his palms up, moving his hands up and down in opposition, as if theywere scales holding great weight. “The gifted on both sides will be workingharder than they have ever worked before. I can tell you that it’s exhausting.The result, except with small shifts in the advantage, is that it will seem asif we are doing nothing to earn our dinner.”Zedd let his hands drop. “It will be punctuated with brief moments of sheerhorror and true panic when it seems beyond doubt that the world itself is aboutto end in one final fit of sheer madness.”General Reibisch grinned in an odd, gentle, knowing way. “Let me tell you, war,when you’re holding a sword, looks about the same way.” He held up a hand inmock defense. “But I’d rather that, I guess, than have to swing my sword atevery magic mosquito that came along. I’m a man of steel against steel. We haveLord Rahl to be the magic against the magic. I’m relieved we have Lord Rahl’sgrandfather, the First Wizard, to aid us, too. Thank you, Zedd. Anything youneed is yours. Just ask.”Verna and Warren added silent nods as the general stepped to the entrance of thetent. When Zedd spoke, General Reibisch turned back, gripping the flap in onehand.“You’re still sending messengers to Richard?”The general confirmed that they were. “Captain Meiffert was up there, too. Hemight be able tell you more about Lord Rahl.”“Have all of the messengers returned safely?”“Most of them.” He rubbed his bearded chin. “We’ve lost two, so far. Onemessenger was found by chance at the bottom of a rockslide. Another neverreturned, but his body wasn’t found-which wouldn’t be unusual. It’s a long anddifficult journey. There are any number of hazards on such a journey; we have toexpect we might lose a few men.”“I’d like you to stop sending men up there to Richard.”“But Lord Rahl needs to be kept informed.”“What if the enemy should capture one of those messengers and find out whereRichard is? If you have no scruples, most any man can eventually be made totalk. The risk is not worth it.”The general rubbed his palm on the hilt of his sword as he considered Zedd’swords. “The Order is far to the south of us-way down in Anderith. We control allthe land between here and the mountains where Lord Rahl is staying.” He shookhis head in resignation at Zedd’s unflinching gaze. “But if you think it’s aconcern, I’ll not send another. Won’t Lord Rahl wonder, though, what’s going onwith us?”“What’s going on with us is not really relevant to him right now; he is doing ashe must do, and he can’t allow our situation to influence him. He has told youalready that he won’t be able to give you any orders, that he must stay out ofit.”Zedd tugged his sleeves straight and sighed as he thought about it. “Perhapswhen the summer is over, before the full grip of winter descends and they’resnowed in way up there, I’ll go and see how they fare.”General Reibisch gave a departing smile. “If you could talk to Lord Rahl, itwould be a relief for us all, Zedd; he would trust your word. Good night, then.”The man had just betrayed his true feelings. No one in the tent really trustedwhat Richard was doing, except, perhaps, Zedd, and Zedd had his doubts, too.Kahlan had said that she believed Richard viewed himself as a fallen leader;these people who claimed not to understand how he could believe such a thing, atthe same time didn’t trust his actions.Richard was all alone with only the strength of his beliefs to support him.After the general had gone, Warren leaned forward eagerly. “Zedd, I could gowith you to see Richard. We could get him to tell us everything, and we couldthen determine if it really is a prophecy, or as he says, just an understandinghe’s come to. If it’s not really a prophecy, we might be able to make him seethings differently.“More important, we could begin teaching him-or you could, anyway-about hisgift, about using magic. He needs to know how to use his ability.”As Zedd paced, Verna let out a little grunt to express her misgivings aboutWarren’s suggestion. “I tried to teach Richard to touch his Han. A number ofSisters attempted it, too. No one was able to make any progress.”“But Zedd believes a wizard is the one to do it. Isn’t that right, Zedd?”Zedd halted his pacing and regarded them both a moment as he considered how toput his thoughts into words. “Well, as I said before, teaching a wizard is notreally the work for sorceresses, but another wizard-”“With Richard, I don’t think you would have any better luck than we did,” Vernarailed.Warren didn’t give ground. “But Zedd believes-Zedd cleared his throat, bidding silence. “You’re right, my boy; it is the jobof a wizard to teach another wizard born with the gift.” Verna rose an angryfinger to object, but Zedd went right on. “In this case, however, I believeVerna is right.”“She is?” Warren asked.“I am?” Verna asked.Zedd waved in a mollifying gesture. “Yes, I believe so, Verna. I think theSisters can do some teaching. After all, look at Warren, here. The Sisters havemanaged to teach him something about using his gift, even if it was at the costof time. You’ve taught others-if in a limited way, to my view of it-but youcouldn’t manage to teach Richard the most simple of things. Is that correct?”Verna’s mouth twisted with displeasure. “None of us could teach him the simpletask of sensing his own Han. I sat with him hours at a time and tried to guidehim through it.” She folded her arms and looked away from his intent gaze. “Itjust didn’t work the way it should have.”Warren touched a finger to his chin while he frowned, as if recalling something.“You know, Nathan said something to me once. I told him that I wanted to learnfrom him-that I wanted him to teach me about being a prophet. Nathan said that aprophet could not be made, but that they were born. I realized, then, thateverything I knew and understood about prophecy-really understood about it, in awhole new way-I had learned on my own, and not from anyone else. Could this,with Richard, be something like that? Is that your point, Zedd?”“It is.” Zedd sat down once more on the hard wooden bench beside Adie. “I wouldlove, not only as his grandfather, but as First Wizard, to teach Richard what heneeds to know about using his ability, but I’m coming to doubt that such a thingis possible. Richard is different from any other wizard in more ways than justhis having the gift for Subtractive Magic in addition to the usual Additive.”“But still,” Sister Philippa said, “you are First Wizard. Surely, you would beable to teach him a great deal.”Zedd pulled a fold of his heavy robes from between his bony bottom and the hardbench as he considered how to explain it.“Richard has done things even I don’t understand. Without my training, he hasaccomplished more than I can even fathom. On his own, Richard reached the Templeof the Winds in the underworld, accomplished the task of stopping a plague, andreturned from beyond the veil to the world of life. Can any of you even graspsuch a thing? Especially for an untrained wizard? He banished the chimes fromthe world of the living-how, I have no idea. He has worked magic I’ve neverheard of, much less seen or understand.“I’m afraid my knowledge could be more of an interference than an aid. Part ofRichard’s ability, and advantage, is the way he views the world-through not justfresh eyes, but the eyes of a Seeker of Truth. He doesn’t know something isimpossible, so he tries to accomplish it. I fear to tell him how to do things,how to use his magic, because such teaching also might suggest to him limits ofhis powers, thus creating them in reality. What could I teach a war wizard? Iknow nothing about the Subtractive side of magic, much less the gift of suchpower.”“Lacking another war wizard with Subtractive Magic, are you suggesting it wouldmaybe take a Sister of the Dark to teach him?” Warren asked.“Well,” Zedd mused, “that might be a thought.” He let out a tired sigh as heturned more serious. “I have come to realize that it would not only be uselessto try to teach Richard to use his ability, but it may even be dangerous-to theworld.“I would like to go see him, and offer him my encouragement, experience, andunderstanding, but help?” Zedd shook his head. “I don’t dare.”No one offered any objection. Verna, for one, had firsthand experience that verylikely confirmed the truth of his words. The rest of them probably knew Richardwell enough to understand much the same.“May I help you find a spare tent, Zedd?” Verna finally asked. “You look likeyou could use some rest. In the morning, after you get a good night’s rest, andwe all think this over, we can talk more.”Warren, who had just been about to ask another question before Verna spokefirst, looked disappointed, but nodded in agreement.Zedd stretched his legs out straight as he yawned. “That would be best.” Thethought of the job ahead was daunting. He ached to see Richard, to help him,especially after searching for him for so long. Sometimes it was hard to leavepeople alone when that was what they most needed. “That would be best,” herepeated, “I am tired.”“Summer be slipping away from us. The nights be turning chilly,” Adie said asshe pressed against Zedd’s side. She looked up at him with her white eyes thatin the lamplight had a soft amber cast. “Stay with me and warm my bones, oldman?”Zedd smiled as he embraced her. It was as much of a comfort to be with her againas he had expected. In fact, at that moment, if she had given him another hatwith a feather, he would have donned it, and with a smile. Worry, though, achedthrough his bones like an approaching storm.“Zedd,” Verna said, seeming to notice in his eyes the weight of his thoughts,“Richard is a war wizard who, as you say, has in the past proven his remarkableability. He’s a very resourceful young man. Besides that, he is none other thanthe Seeker himself and has the Sword of Truth with him for protection-a swordthat I can testify he knows how to use. Kahlan is a Confessor-the MotherConfessor and is experienced in the use of her power. They have a Mord-Sith withthem. MordSith take no chances.”“I know,” Zedd whispered, staring off into a nightmare swirl of thoughts. “But Istill fear greatly for them.”“What is it that worries you so?” Warren asked.“Albino mosquitoes.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18Panting in exhaustion, Kahlan had to dance backward through the snarl ofhobblebush stitched through with thorny blackberry to dodge the swing of thesword. The tip whistled past, missing her ribs by an inch. In her mad dash toescape, she ignored the snag and tug of thorns on her pants. She could feel herheartbeat galloping at the base of her skull.As he relentlessly pressed his attack, forcing her back over a low rise of ledgeand through the swale beyond, mounds of fallen leaves kicked aloft by his bootsboiled up into the late-afternoon air like colorful thunderheads. The brightyellow, lustrous orange, and vivid red leaves rained down over rocky outcropsswaddled in prickly whorls of juniper. It was like doing battle amid a fallenrainbow.Richard lunged at her again. Kahlan gasped but blocked his sword. He pressed hisgrim attack with implacable determination. She gave ground, stepping high as shedid so in order to avoid tripping over the snare of roots around a huge whitespruce. Losing her footing would be fatal; if she fell, Richard would stab herin an instant.She glanced left. There loomed a tall prominence of sheer rock draped with longtrailers of woolly moss. To the other side, the brink of the ridge ran back toeventually meet that rock wall. Once the level ground tapered down to that deadend, the only option was going to be to climb straight up or straight down.She deflected a quick thrust of his sword, and he warded hers. In a burst offury, she pressed a fierce assault, forcing him back a dozen steps. Heeffortlessly parried her strikes, and then returned her attack in kind. What shehad gained was quickly lost twice over. She was once again desperately defendingherself and trading ground for her life.On a low, dead branch of a balsam fir not ten feet away, a small red squirrel,with his winter ear tufts already grown in, plucked a leathery brown rosette oflichen growing on the bark. With his white belly gloriously displayed, he sat onhis haunches at the end of the broken-off deadwood, his bushy tail raised up,holding the crinkled piece of lichen in his tiny paws, eating round and roundthe edges, like some spectator at a tournament eating a fried bread cake whilehe watched the combatants clash.Kahlan gulped air as her eyes darted around, looking for clear footing among theimposing trunks of the highland wood while at the same time watching for anopportunity that might save her. If she could somehow get around Richard, aroundthe menace of his sword, she might be able to gain a clear escape route. Hewould run her down, but it would buy her time. She dodged a quick thrust of hissword and ducked around a maple sapling into a bed of brown and yellow brackenferns dappled by glowing sunlight.Richard, driving forward in a sudden mad rush to end it, lifted his sword tohack her.It was her opening-her only chance.In a blink, Kahlan reversed her retreat and sprang ahead a step, ducking underhis arm. She drove her sword straight into his soft middle.Richard covered the wound with both hands. He teetered a moment, and thencrumpled into the bed of ferns, sprawling flat on his back. Leaves lying lightlyatop taller ferns were lifted by the disturbance. They somersaulted up into theair, finally drifting down to brightly decorate his body. The fierce red of themaple leaves was so vibrant it would have made blood look brown by comparison.Kahlan stood over Richard, gasping to catch her breath. She was spent. Shedropped to her knees and then threw herself across his supine body. All aroundthem, fern fronds, the color of caramel candy, were curled into little fists asif in defiance of having to die with the season. The sprinkling of lighter,yellowish, hayscented ferns lent a clean, sweet scent to the afternoon air.There were few things that could equal the fragrance of the woods in lateautumn. In a spectacular bit of chance, a tall maple nearby, sheltered as it wasby a protective corner in the rock wall, was not yet denuded, but displayed awide spread of leaves so orange they looked tangy against the powder blue skyabove.“Cara!” Putting her left hand to Richard’s chest, Kahlan pushed herself up onone arm to call out. “Cara! I killed Richard!”Cara, not far off, laying on her belly at the edge of the ridge as she watchedout beyond, said nothing.“I killed him! Did you hear? Cara-did you see?”“Yes,” she muttered, “I heard. You killed Lord Rahl.”“No you didn’t,” Richard said, still catching his breath.She whacked him across the shoulder with her willow-switch sword. “Yes I did. Ikilled you this time. Killed you dead.”“You only grazed me.” He pressed the point of his willow switch to her side.“You’ve fallen into my trap. I have you at the point of my sword, now.Surrender, or die, woman.”“Never,” she said, still gasping for breath as she laughed. “I’d rather die thanbe captured by the likes of you, you rogue.”She stabbed him repeatedly in his ribs with her willow practice sword as hegiggled and rolled from side to side.“Cara! Did you see? I killed him this time. I finally got him!”“Yes, all fight,” Cara grouched as she intently watched out beyond the ridge.“You killed Lord Rahl. Good for you.” She glanced back over her shoulder. “Thisone is mine, right, Lord Rahl? You promised this one was mine.”“Yes,” Richard said, still catching his breath, “this one goes for yours, Cara.”“Good.” Cara smiled in satisfaction. “It’s a big one.”Richard smirked up at Kahlan. “I let you kill me, you know.”“No you didn’t! I won. I got you this time.” She whacked him again with herwillow sword. She paused and frowned. “I thought you said you weren’t dead. Yousaid it was only a scratch. Ha! You admitted I got you this time.”Richard chuckled. “I let you-”Kahlan kissed him to shut him up. Cara saw and rolled her eyes.When Cara looked back over the ridge, she suddenly sprang up. “They just left!Come on, before something gets it!”“Cara, nothing is going to get it,” Richard said, “not this quickly.’“Come on! You promised this one was mine. I don’t want to have gone through allthis for nothing. Come on.”“All right, all right.” Richard said as Kahlan climbed off him. “We’re coming.”He held his hand out for Kahlan to help him up. She stabbed him in the ribsinstead. “Got you again, Lord Rahl. You’re getting sloppy.”Richard only smiled as Kahlan finally offered her hand. When he was up he huggedher in a quick gesture, and before turning to follow after Cara, said, “Goodjob, Mother Confessor, good job. You killed me dead. I’m proud of you.”Kahlan endeavored to show him a sedate smile, but she feared it came out as agiddy grin. Richard scooped up his pack and hefted it onto his back. Withoutdelay, he started the descent down the steep, broken face of the mountain.Kahlan threw her long wolf’s-fur mantle around her shoulders and followed himthrough the deep shade of sheltering spruce at the edge of the ridge, steppingon the exposed ledge rather than the low places.“Be careful,” Richard called out to Cara, already a good distance ahead of them,“With all the leaves covering the ground, you can’t see holes or gaps in therock.”“I know, I know,” she grumbled. “How many times do you think I need to hearit’?”Richard constantly watched out for them both. He had taught them how to walk insuch terrain and what to be careful of. From the beginning, marching through theforests and mountains, Kahlan noted that Richard moved with quiet fluidity,while Cara traipsed along, bounding up onto and off of rocks and ledges, almostlike an exuberant youngster. Since Cara had spent most of her life indoors, shedidn’t know that it made a difference how you walked in such terrain.Richard had patiently explained to her, “Pick where to put your feet in order tomake your steps comparatively level. Don’t step down to a lower spot if youdon’t need to, only to have to step up again as you continue your climb up thetrail. Don’t step up needlessly, only to have to step down again. If you muststep up on something, you don’t always need to lift your whole body just flexyour legs.”Cara complained that it was too hard to think about where to put her foot eachtime. He told her that by walling the way she did, she was actually climbing themountain twice for each time he climbed it. He admonished her to think as shewalked, and soon it would become instinctive and would require no consciousthought. When Cara found that her shin and thigh muscles didn’t get as tired andsore when she followed his suggestions, she became a keen student. Now she askedquestions instead of arguing. Most of the time.Kahlan saw that as Cara descended the steep trail, she did as Richard had taughther and used a stick as an improvised staff to probe any suspicious low areawhere leaves collected before stepping there. This was no place to break anankle. Richard said nothing, but sometimes he smiled when she found a hole withher stick rather than her foot, as she used to.Forging a new trail on a steep slope like the one they were descending wasdangerous work. Potential trails often withered into dead ends, requiring thatyou retrace your steps. On less severe slopes, hillsides, and flatter groundespecially, animals often made good trails. In a valley, a suitable trail thatshrank to nothing wasn’t a big problem because there you could beat through thebrush to more open ground. Making your own trail on a rocky precipice, athousand feet up, was always arduous and often frustrating. In such conditions,particularly if the hour grew late, the desire not to have to backtrack adifficult climb tempted people into taking chances.Richard said that it was hard work that demanded you put reason before your wishto get down, get home, or get to a place to camp. “Wishing gets people killed,”he often said. “Using your head gets you home.”Cara poked her stick into a pile of leaves between bare granite rocks. “Don’tstep in the leaves here,” she said over her shoulder as she hopped onto the farrock. “There’s a hole.”“Why, thank you, Cara,” Richard said in mock gratitude, as if he would havestepped there had she not warned him.The cliff face they were on had a number of sizable ledges with rugged littletrees and shrubs that provided good footing and the safety of a handhold. Below,the mountainside dropped away before them into a lush ravine. Beyond the defile,it rose up again in a steep slope covered with evergreens and the dull gray andbrown skeletons of oaks, maples, and birches.The raucous coats of autumn leaves had been resplendent while they lasted, butnow they were but confetti on the ground, and there they faded fast. Usually,the oaks held on to their leaves until at least early winter, and some of themuntil spring, but up in the mountains icy winds and early storms had alreadystripped even the oaks bare of their tenacious brown leaves.Cara stepped out onto a shelf of ledge jutting out over the chasm below.“There,” she said as she pointed across the way. “Up there. Do you see?”Richard shielded his eyes against the warm sunlight as he squinted higher up onthe opposite slope. He made a sound deep in his throat to confirm that he sawit. “Nasty place to die.”Kahlan snugged the warm wolf fur up against her ears to protect them from thecold wind. “There’s a good place?”Richard let his hand drop from his brow. “I guess not.”Farther up the slope from where Cara had pointed, the forest ended in a placecalled the crooked wood. Above that, where no trees could grow, the mountain wasnaked rock ridges and scree. A little farther up, snow, white as sugar, sparkledin the slanting sunlight. Below the snow and bare rock, the crooked wood wasexposed to harsh winds and bitter weather, causing the trees to grow in torturedshapes. The crooked wood was a line of demarcation between the desolation wherelittle more than lichen could survive the forbidding weather, and the forest oftrees huddled below.Richard gestured off to their right. “Let’s not waste any time, though. I don’twant to be caught up here come dark.”Kahlan looked out to where the mountain opened onto a grand vista of snowcappedpeaks, valleys, and the undulating green of seemingly endless, tracklessforests. A roiling blanket of thick clouds had invaded those valleys, stealingin around the mountains, sneaking ever closer. In the distance, some of thesnowcapped peaks stood isolated in a cottony gray sea. Lower down the mountains,below those dense, dark clouds, the weather would be miserable.Both Richard and Cara awaited Kahlan’s word. She didn’t like the thought ofbeing exposed in the crooked wood when the icy cold fog and drizzle arrived.“I’m fine, let’s go and get it done. Then we can get down lower where we’ll beable to find a wayward pine to stay dry tonight. I wouldn’t mind sitting besidea hearty little fire sipping hot tea.”Cara blew warm breath into her cupped hands. “That sounds good to me.”It was on the first day Kahlan met Richard, more than a year before, that he hadtaken her to a wayward pine. Kahlan had never known about such trees in the deepwoods of Westland. Wayward pines still held the same mystic quality for her asthey did the first time she saw one silhouetted against a darkening sky, tallerthan all the trees around it. Such mature trees were a friend to travelers farfrom any conventional shelter.A big wayward pine’s boughs hung down to the ground all around. The needles grewmostly at the outer fringe, leaving the inner branches bare. Inside, under theirdense green skirts, wayward pines provided excellent shelter from harsh weather,Something about the tree’s sap made them resistant to fire, so if you werecareful, you could have a cozy campfire inside while outside it rained andstormed.Richard, Kahlan, and Cara often stayed in wayward pines when they were out inthe mountains. Those nights getting warm around a small fire within the tree’sconfines brought them all closer, and gave them time to reflect, to talk, and totell stories. Some of the stories made them laugh. Some brought a lump to theirthroats.After Kahlan’s assurance that she was up to it, Richard and Cara nodded andstarted down the cliff. She had recovered from her terrible wounds, but theystill left it up to her to decide if she was prepared for the effort of such adescent and climb and then descent again before they found a shelteredcampsite-hopefully in a wayward pine.Kahlan had been a long time in healing. She had known, of course, that injuriessuch as she had suffered would take time to heal. Bedridden for so long, hermuscles had become withered, weak, and nearly useless. For a long time, it hadbeen hard for her to eat much. She became a skeleton. With the realization ofjust how weak and helpless she had become, even as she healed, she hadinexorably spiraled down into a state of abject depression.Kahlan had not comprehended completely the punishing effort that would berequired if she was to he herself again. Richard and Cara tried to cheer her up,but their efforts seemed distant; they just didn’t understand what it was like.Her legs wasted away until they were bony sticks with knobby knees. She felt notjust helpless, but ugly. Richard carved animals for her: hawks, foxes, otters,ducks, and even chipmunks. They seemed only a curiosity to her. At the lowestpoint, Kahlan almost wished she had died along with their child.Her life became a tasteless gruel. All she saw, day after day, week after week,were the four walls of her sickroom. The pain was exhausting and the monotonynumbing. She came to hate the bitter yarrow tea they made her drink, and thesmell of the poultice made of tall cinquefoil and yarrow. When after a time sheresisted drinking yarrow, they would sometimes switch to linden, which wasn’t sobitter but didn’t work as well, yet it did help her sleep. Skullcap often helpedwhen her head hurt, though it was so astringent it make her mouth pucker for along time after, Sometimes, they switched to a tincture of feverfew to help easeher pain. Kahlan came to hate taking herbs and would often say she didn’t hurt,when she did, just to avoid some horrid concoction.Richard hadn’t made the window in the bedroom very big; in the summer heat theroom was often sweltering. Kahlan could see only a bit of the sky outside herwindow, the tops of some trees, and the jagged blue.-gray shape of a mountain inthe distance.Richard wanted to take her outside, but Kahlan begged him not to try because shedidn’t think it would be worth the pain. It didn’t take much convincing for himto be talked out of hurting her. Every kind of day, from sunny and bright togray and gloomy, came and went. Lying in her little room as time slipped awaywhile she slowly healed, Kahlan thought of it as her “lost summer.”One day, she was parched, and Richard had forgotten to fill the cup and place itwhere she could reach it on the simple table beside the bed. When she asked forwater, Richard came back with the cup and a full waterskin and set them both onthe windowsill as he called to Cara, outside. He rushed out, telling Kahlan ashe went that he and Cara had to go check the fishing lines and they would beback as soon as they could. Before Kahlan could ask him to put the water closer,he was gone.Kahlan lay fuming in the silence, hardly able to believe that Richard had beenso inconsiderate as to leave the water out of her reach. It was unusually warmfor late summer. Her tongue felt swollen. She stared helplessly at the woodencup setting in the windowsill.On the verge of tears, she let out a moan of self-pity and smacked her fistagainst the bed. She rolled her head to the right, away from the window, andclosed her eyes. She decided to take a nap in order not to think about herthirst. Richard and Cara would be back by the time she awoke, and they would getthe water for her. And Richard would get a scolding.Sweat trickled down her neck. Outside, a bird kept calling. Its repetitious songsounded like a little girl with a high pitched voice saying “who, me?” Once a“who, me?” bird started in, it was a long performance. Kahlan could think oflittle else besides how much she wanted a drink.She couldn’t make herself fall asleep. The annoying bird kept asking itsquestion over and over again. More than once, she found herself whispering “yes,you,” in answer. She growled a curse at Richard. She squeezed her eyes shut andtried to forget her thirst, the heat, and the bird and go to sleep. Her eyeskept popping open.Kahlan lifted her sleeping gown away from her chest, ruffling it up and down tocool herself. She realized she was staring at the water in the window. It wasout of her reach-clear over on the other side of the room. The room wasn’t verybig, but still, she couldn’t walk. Richard knew better. She thought that maybe,if she could sit up and move to the bottom of the bed, she might be able toreach the cup.With an ill-tempered huff, she threw the light cover off her bony legs. Shehated seeing them. Why was Richard being so inconsiderate? What was the matterwith him? She intended to give him a piece of her mind when he got back. Sheeased her legs over the side of the bed.The mattress was a pliable woven mat stuffed with grasses and feathers and towpadding. It was quite comfortable, and Kahlan was pleased with her snug bed.With a great effort, she pushed herself up. For a long time, she sat on the edgeof the bed holding her head in her hands as she caught her breath. Her wholebody throbbed in pain.It was the first time she had sat up all by herself.She understood very well what Richard was doing. Still, she didn’t appreciatehis way of forcing her to get up. It was cruel. She wasn’t ready. She was stillbadly hurt. She needed to rest in bed in order to recover. Her oozing wounds hadfinally closed up and healed over, but she was sure she was still too injured tobe getting up. She feared to test broken bones.Accompanied by a lot of groaning and grunting, she worked herself to the bottomof the bed. Sitting there, one hand holding the footboard to steady herself, shewas still too far from the window to reach the water. She was going to have tostand.She paused for a while to have dark thoughts about her husband.After a day many weeks before, when she had called for a long time and Richardhadn’t heard her weak voice, he had left a light pole beside her so she would beable to use it to reach out and knock on the wall or door if she was in urgentneed of their help. Now, Kahlan worked her fingers around the pole lyingalongside her bed and lifted it upright. She planted the thicker end on theground and leaned on the pole for support as she carefully slid off the bed. Herfeet touched the cool dirt floor. Putting weight on her legs made her gasp inpain.She half stood, half leaned on the bed, prepared to cry out, but realized shewas gasping more at the brutal pain she expected than from the actual pain. Itdid hurt, but she realized it wasn’t too much to endure. She was a bitdisgruntled to learn it wasn’t nearly as bad as it had been; she had beenplanning on reducing Richard to tears with the torturous suffering he had socavalierly forced upon her.She put more weight on her feet and pulled herself up with the aid of the pole.Finally, she stood in wobbling triumph. She was actually on her feet, and shehad done it by herself.Kahlan couldn’t seem to make her legs walk the way she wanted them to. In orderto get to the water, she was going to have to make them do her bidding-at leastuntil she reached the window. Then, she could collapse to the floor, whereRichard would find her. She luxuriated in her mental picture of it. He wouldn’tthink his plan to get her out of bed so clever, then.With the aid of the stout pole for support and her tongue poked out the cornerof her mouth for balance, she slowly shuffled to the window. Kahlan told herselfthat if she fell, she was going to lie there in a heap on the floor, without anywater, until Richard came back and found her moaning through cracked lips, dyingof thirst. He would be sorry he had ever tried such a pitiless trick. He wouldfeel guilty for the rest of his life for what he had done to her-she would seeto it.Almost wishing every difficult step of the way that she would fall, she finallymade it to the window. Kahlan threw an arm over the sill for support and closedher eyes as she panted in little breaths so as not to hurt her ribs. When shehad her wind back, she drew herself up to the window. She snatched the cup andgulped down the water.Kahlan plunked the empty cup down on the sill and peered out as she caught herbreath again.Richard was sitting on the ground just outside, his arms hooked around hisknees, his hands clasped.“Hi there,” he said with a smile.Cara, sitting right beside him, gazed up without emotion. “I see you’re up.”Kahlan wanted to yell at him, but instead she found herself trying with all hermight not to laugh. She felt suddenly and overwhelmingly foolish for not tryingsooner to get up on her own.Tears stung her eyes as she looked out at the expanse of trees, the vibrantcolors, the majestic mountains, and the huge sweep of blue sky dotted withfluffy white clouds marching off into the distance. The size of the mountains,their imposing slopes, their luscious color, was beyond anything she had everencountered before. How could she possibly not have wanted more than anything toget up and see the world around her?“You know, of course, that you’ve made a big mistake,” Richard said.“What do you mean?” Kahlan asked.“Well, had you not gotten up, we’d have kept waiting on you-at least for a time.Now that you’ve shown us that you can get up and move on your own, we’re onlygoing to keep doing this-putting things out of your reach to make you startmoving about and helping yourself.”While she silently thanked him, she was unwilling, just yet, to tell him outloud how right he had been. But inside, she loved him all the more for bravingher anger to help her.Cara turned to Richard. “Should we show her where she can find the table?”Richard shrugged. “If she gets hungry, she’ll come out of the bedroom and findit.”Kahlan threw the cup at him, hoping to wipe the smirk off his face. He caughtthe cup.“Well, glad to see your arm works,” he said. “You can cut your own bread.” Whenshe started to protest, he said, “It’s only fair. Cara baked it. The least youcan do is to cut it.”Kahlan’s mouth fell open. “Cara baked bread?”“Lord Rahl taught me,” Cara said. “I wanted bread with my stew, real bread, andhe told me that if I wanted bread, I would have to learn to make it. It waseasy, really. A little like walking to the window. But I was much moregood-natured about it, and didn’t throw anything at him.”Kahlan could not help smiling, knowing it must have been harder for Cara toknead dough than for Kahlan to get up and walk. She somehow doubted that Carahad been “good-natured” about it. Kahlan would like to have seen that battle ofwills.“Give me back my cup. And then go catch some fish for dinner. I’m hungry. I wanta trout. A big trout. Along with bread.”Richard smiled. “I can do that. If you can find the table.”Kahlan did find the table. She never ate in bed again.At first, the pain of walking was sometimes more than she could tolerate, andshe took refuge in her bed. Cara would come in and brush her hair, just soKahlan wouldn’t be alone. She had no power in her muscles, and could hardly moveby herself. Brushing her own hair was a colossal task. Just getting to the tablewas exhausting, and all she could accomplish at first. Richard and Cara weresympathetic, and continually encouraged her, but they pushed her, too.Kahlan was joyous to be out of the bed and that helped her to ignore the pain.The world was again a wondrous place. She was more than joyous to be able atlast to go out to the privy. While she never said so, Kahlan was sure Cara washappy about that, too.As much as she liked the snug home, going outside felt like finally being freedfrom a dungeon. Before, Richard had frequently offered to take her outside forthe day, but she had never wanted to leave her bed, fearing the pain. Sherealized that because she was so sick, her thinking had slowly become dull andfoggy. Along with her summer, she had for a time lost herself. Now, at longlast, she felt clearheaded.She discovered that the view outside her window was the least impressive of thesurrounding sights. Snowcapped peaks towered around the small house Richard andCara had built in the lap of breathtaking mountains. The simple house, with abedroom at either end, one for Richard and Kahlan, and one for Cara, with acommon room in the middle, sat at the edge of a meadow of velvety green grassessprinkled with wildflowers. Even though it was late in the season when they hadarrived, Richard managed to start a small garden in a sunny place outside Cara’swindow, growing fresh greens for the table and some herbs to add flavor to theircooking. Right behind the house, huge old white pines towered over them,sheltering them from the full force of the wind.Richard had continued his carving, to pass the time as he sat by Kahlan’s bed,talking and telling stories, but after she had at last gotten out of bed, hiscarvings changed. Instead of animals, Richard began sculpting people.And then one day he surprised her with his most magnificent carving yet incelebration, he said, of her getting well enough to finally come out into theworld.Astonished by the utter realism and power of the small statue, she whisperedthat it could only be the gift that had guided his hand in carving it. Richardregarded such talk as nonsense.“People without the gift carve beautiful statues all the time,” he said.“There’s no magic involved.”She knew, though, that some artists were gifted, and able to invoke magicthrough their art.Richard occasionally spoke wistfully about the works of art he’d seen at thePeople’s Palace, in D’Hara, where he had been held captive. Growing up in Hartland, he had never before seen statues carved in marble, and certainly nonecarved on such a grand scale, or by such talented hands. Those works had in someways opened his eyes to the greater world around him and had made a lastingimpression on him. Who else but Richard would remember fondly the beauty he sawwhile held captive and being tortured?It was true that art could exist independent of magic, but Richard had beentaken captive in the first place only with the aid of a spell brought to lifethrough art. Art was a universal language, and thus an invaluable tool forimplementing magic.Kahlan finally stopped arguing with him about whether the gift helped him tocarve. He simply didn’t believe it. She felt, though, that, having no otheroutlet, his gift must be expressing itself in this way. Magic always seemed tofind a way to seep out, and his carvings of people certainly did seem magical toher.But the figure of the woman that he carved for her as a gift stirred profoundemotion within her. He called it, an image nearly two feet tall carved frombuttery smooth, rich, aromatic walnut, Spirit. The feminity of her body, itsexquisite shape and curves, bones and muscle, were clearly evident beneath herflowing robes. She looked alive.How Richard had accomplished such a feat, Kahlan couldn’t even imagine. He hadconveyed through the woman, her robes flowing in a wind as she stood with herhead thrown back, her chest out, her hands fisted at her sides, her back archedand strong as if in opposition to an invisible power trying unsuccessfully tosubdue her, a sense of . . . spirit.The statue was obviously not intended to look like Kahlan, yet it evoked in hersome visceral response, a tension that was startlingly familiar. Something aboutthe woman in the carving, some quality it conveyed, made Kahlan hunger to bewell, to be fully alive, to be strong and independent again.If this wasn’t magic, she didn’t know what was.Kahlan had been around grand palaces her whole life, exposed to any number ofpieces of great art by renowned artists, but none had ever taken her breath withits thrust of inner vision, its sense of individual nobility, as did this proud,vibrant woman in flowing robes. The strength and vitality of it brought a lumpto Kahlan’s throat, and she could only throw her arms around Richard’s neck inspeechless emotion."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19Now Kahlan went outside at every opportunity. She placed the carving of Spiriton the windowsill so she could see it not only from bed, but also when she wasoutdoors. She turned the statue so that it always faced outside. She felt itshould always be facing the world.The woods around the house were mysterious and alluring. Intriguing trails wentoff into the shadowy distance, and she could just detect light off at the end ofthe gently curving tunnel through the trees. She ached to explore those narrowtracks, animal trails enlarged by Richard and Cara on their short treks to tendfishing lines and forays in search of nuts and berries. Kahlan, with the aid ofa staff, hobbled around the house and the meadow to strengthen her legs; shewanted to go with Richard on those treks, through the filtered sunlight andgentle breezes, over the open patches of ledge, and under the arched, enclosinglimbs of huge oaks.One of the first places Richard took her when she insisted she could walk for ashort distance was through that tunnel in the thick, dark wood to the patch oflight at the other end, where a brook descended a rocky gorge. The brook wassheltered on the hillside above them by a dense stand of trees. An enormousweight of water continuously plunged over that stepped tumble of rocks, surgingaround boulders and pouring in glassy sheets over ledges. Many of the bear-sizedrocks sitting in the shady pools were flocked in a dark green velvet of moss andsprinkled with long tawny needles from the white pines that favored the rockslope. Flecks of sunlight winking through the dense canopy shimmered in theclear pools.At the bottom of that gorge, in that sunny mountain glen off behind their housewhere the trail emerged from the woods, the brook broadened and slowed as itmeandered through the expansive valley surrounded by the awesome jut of themountains. Sometimes Kahlan would dangle her bony legs over a bank and let thecool water caress her feet. There, she could sit on the warm grass and soak upthe sun while watching fish swim through the crystal-clear water flowing overgravel beds. Richard had been right when he told her that trout liked beautifulplaces.She loved watching the fish, frogs, crayfish, and even the salamanders.Oftentimes, she would lie on her stomach on the low grassy bank, with her chinresting on the backs of her hands, and watch for hours as the fish came out fromunder sunken logs, from beneath rocks, or from the dark depths of the largerpools to snatch a bug from the surface of the water. Kahlan caught crickets,grasshoppers, and grubs and periodically tossed them in for the fish. Richardlaughed when she talked to the fish, encouraging them to come up out of theirdark holes for a tasty bug. Sometimes, a graceful gray heron would stand on itsthin legs in the shallow marshes not far away and occasionally spear a fish or afrog with its daggerlike bill.Kahlan could not recall, in the whole of her life, ever being in a place withsuch a vibrancy of life to it, surrounded by such majesty. Richard teased her,telling her she hadn’t seen anything yet, making her curious and ever eager toget stronger so she could explore new sights. She felt like a little girl in amagical kingdom that was theirs and theirs alone. Having grown up a Confessor,Kahlan had never spent much time outdoors watching animals or water tumblingdown over rocks or clouds or sunsets. She had seen a great many magnificentthings, but they were in the context of travel, cities, buildings, and people.She had never lingered in one place in the countryside to really soak it all in.Still, the thoughts in the back of her mind hounded her; she knew that she andRichard were needed elsewhere. They had responsibilities. Richard casuallydeflected the subject whenever she broached it; he had already explained hisreasoning, and believed he was doing what was right.They hadn’t been visited by messengers for a very long time. That worry playedon her mind, too, but Richard said that he couldn’t allow himself to influencethe army, so it was just as well that General Reibisch had stopped sendingreports. Besides, he said, it only needlessly endangered the messengers who madethe journey.For the time being, Kahlan knew she needed to get better, and her isolatedmountain life was making her stronger by the day, probably as nothing elsecould. Once they returned to the war-once she convinced him that they mustreturn-this peaceful life would be but a cherished memory. She resolved to enjoywhat she couldn’t change, while it lasted.Once when it had been raining for a few days and Kahlan was missing going out tothe brook to watch the fish, Richard did the most unheard-of thing. He startedbringing her fish in ajar. Live fish. Fish just for watching.After he’d cleaned an empty lamp-oil jug and several widemouthed glass jars thathad held preserves, herbs, and unguents for her injuries, along with othersupplies he had purchased on their journey away from Anderith, he put somegravel in the bottom and filled them with water from the stream. He then caughtsome blacknose dace minnows and put them in the glass containers. They wereyellowish olive on top speckled with black, with white bottoms, and a thickblack line down each side. He even provided them with a bit of weed from thebrook so they could have a place to hide and feel safe.Kahlan was astonished when Richard brought home the first jar of live fish. Sheset the jars-eventually four jars and one jug in all-on the windowsill in themain room, beside several of Richard’s smaller carvings. Richard, Kahlan, andCara sat at the small wooden table when they ate and watched the marvel of fishliving in ajar.“Just don’t name them,” Richard said, “because eventually they’re going to die.”What she had at first thought was an entirely daft idea became a center offascination for her. Even Cara, who cited fish-in-a-jar as lunacy, took a likingto the little fish. It seemed that every day with Richard in the mountains heldsome new marvel to turn her mind away from her own pains and troubles.After the fish became accustomed to people, they went about their little livesas if living in ajar were perfectly natural. From time to time, Richard wouldpour out part of their water, and add fresh water from the brook. Kahlan andCara fed the little fish crumbs of bread or tiny scraps from dinner, along withsmall bugs. The fish ate eagerly, and spent most of their time pecking at thegravel on the bottom, or swimming about, looking out at the world. After awhile, the fish learned when it was lunchtime. They would wiggle eagerly on theother side of the glass whenever anyone approached, like puppies happy to seetheir masters.The main room had a small fireplace Richard had built with clay from streambanks he’d formed into bricks and dried in the sun, and then cooked in a fire.They had the table he’d made, and chairs constructed of branches intertwined andlashed together. He’d woven the chair bottoms and backs from leathery innerbark.In the corner of the room was a wooden door over a deep root cellar. Against theback wall were simple shelves and a big cupboard full of supplies. They’d boughta lot of supplies along the way and carried them either in the carriage withKahlan or strapped on the back and sides. For the last part of the journeyRichard and Cara had lugged everything in, since the carriage couldn’t make itover narrow mountain passes where there were no roads. Richard had blazed thetrail in.Cara had her own room opposite theirs. Once up and about, Kahlan was surprisedto find that Cara had a collection of rocks. Cara bristled at the term“collection,” and asserted that they were there as defensive weapons, shouldthey be attacked and trapped in the house. Kahlan found the rocks-all differentcolors-suspiciously pretty. Cara insisted they were deadly.While Kahlan had been bedridden, Richard had slept on a pallet in the main room,or sometimes outside under the stars. A number of times, at first, when she wasin so much pain, Kahlan had awakened to see him sitting on the floor beside herbed, dozing as he leaned against the wall, always ready to jump up if she neededanything, or to offer her medicines and herb teas. He hadn’t wanted to sleep inbed with her for fear of it hurting her. She almost would have been willing toendure it for the comfort of his presence beside her. Finally, though, after shewas up and about, he was at last able to lie beside her. That first night withhim in bed, she had held his big warm hand to her belly as she gazed at Spiritsilhouetted in the moonlight, listening to the night calls of birds, bugs, andthe songs of the wolves until her eyes closed and she drifted into a peacefulslumber.It was on the next day that Richard first killed her.They were at the stream, checking the fishing lines, when he cut two straightwillow switches. He tossed one on the ground beside where she sat, and told herit was her sword.He seemed in a playful mood, and told her to defend herself. Feeling playfulherself, Kahlan took up the challenge by suddenly trying to stab him just to puthim in his place. He stabbed her first and declared her dead. She fought himagain, more earnestly the second time, and he quickly dispatched her with aconvincingly feigned beheading. By the third time she went after him, she was alittle irked. She put all her effort into her assault, but he smoothly thwartedher attack and then pressed the tip of his willow-switch sword between herbreasts. He announced her dead for a third time out of three.Thereafter, it became a game Kahlan wanted to win. Richard never let her win,not even just to be nice when she was feeling low because of her slow progressat getting stronger. He repeatedly humbled her in front of Cara. Kahlan knew hewas doing it to make her push herself to use her muscles, to forget her aches,to stretch and strengthen her body. Kahlan just wanted to win.They each carried their willow-switch swords sheathed behind a belt, always atthe ready. Every day, she would attack him, or he would attack her, and thefight was on. At first, she was no challenge to him, and he made it clear shewas no challenge. That, of course, only made her determined to show him that shewas no novice, that it was not so much a battle of strength, but of leverage,advantage, and swiftness. He encouraged her, but never gave her false praise. Asthe weeks passed, she slowly began making him work for his kills.Kahlan had been taught to use a sword by her father, King Wyborn. At least, hehad been king before Kahlan’s mother took him for her mate. King was aninsignificant title to a Confessor. King Wyborn of Galea had had two childrenwith his queen and first wife, so Kahlan had both an older half sister and ahalf brother.Kahlan wanted very much to make a good show of her training under her father. Itwas frustrating to know she was far better with a weapon than she was showingRichard. It wasn’t so much that she didn’t know what to do, but that she simplycouldn’t do it; her muscles were not yet strong enough, nor would they respondnearly quickly enough.Something about it, though, was still unsettling: Richard fought in a way Kahlanhad never encountered in her training, or in the real combat she had seen. Shecouldn’t define or analyze the difference, but she could feel it, and she didn’tknow what to do to counter it.In the beginning, Richard and Kahlan had most of their battles in the meadowoutside their house, so that Kahlan wouldn’t be as likely to trip oversomething, and if she did, not as likely to hit her head on anything granite.Cara was their everpresent audience. As time passed, the battles lasted longer,and grew more strenuous. They became furious and exhausting.A couple of times Kahlan had been so upset by Richard’s relentless attitudetoward their sword fights that she didn’t speak to him for hours afterward, lestshe let slip words she didn’t really mean and which she knew she would regret.Richard would then sometimes tell her, “Save your anger for the enemy. Here itwill do you no good; there, it can overcome fear. Use this time now to teachyour sword what to do, so later it will do it without conscious thought.”Kahlan well knew that an enemy was never kind. If Richard gave in tokindnessawarded her false pride-it could only serve her ill. As aggravating assuch lessons sometimes were, it was impossible to remain angry with Richard forvery long, especially because she knew she was really only angry with herself.Kahlan had been around weapons and men who used them all her life. A few of thebetter ones, in addition to her father, were on occasion her teachers. None ofthem had fought like Richard. Richard made fighting with a blade look like art.He gave beauty to the act of dealing death. There was something about it,though, tickling at her, something she knew she still wasn’t grasping.Richard had told her once, before she had been hurt, that he had come to believethat magic itself could be an art form. She had told him she thought that wascrazy. Now, she didn’t know. From the bits of the story she’d heard, shesuspected that Richard had used magic in something of that way to defeat thechimes: he had created a solution where it had never before existed, or evenbeen imagined.One day, in one of their fierce sword fights, she had been positive she had himdead to rights and that she was delivering the stroke of victory. Heeffortlessly evaded what she had been sure was her killing strike and killed herinstead. He made what had seemed impossible look natural.It was in that instant that the whole concept came clear for her. She had beenlooking at it all wrong.It wasn’t that Richard could fight well with a sword, or that he could createbeautiful statues with a knife and chisel, it was that Richard was one with theblade-the blade in any form: sword, knife, chisel, or willow switch. He was amaster-not of sword fighting or carving as such, but, in the most fundamentalway, of the blade itself.Fighting was but one use of a blade. His balance for using his sword to destroymagic always sought balance-was using a blade to carve things of beauty. She hadbeen looking at the individual parts of what he did, trying to understand themseparately; Richard saw only one unified whole.Everything about him: the way he shot an arrow; the way he carved; the way heused a sword; even the way he walked with such fluid reasoned intent-theyweren’t separate things, separate abilities . . . they were all the same thing.Richard paused. “What’s the matter? Your face is turning white.”Kahlan stood with her willow sword lowered. “You’re dancing with death. That’swhat you’re doing with your sword.”Richard blinked at her as if she had just announced that rain was wet. “But, ofcourse.” Richard touched the amulet hanging at his chest. In the center,surrounded by a complex of gold and silver lines, was a teardrop-shaped ruby asbig as her thumbnail. “I told you that a long time ago. Are you just now comingto believe me?”She stood gaping. “Yes, I think I am.”Kahlan recalled all too clearly his chilling words to her when she had firstseen the amulet around his neck, and she had asked him what it was:“The ruby is meant to represent a drop of blood. It is the symbolicrepresentation of the way of the primary edict.”“It means only one thing, and everything: cut. Once committed to fight, cut.Everything else is secondary. Cut. That is your duty, your purpose, your hunger.There is no rule more important, no commitment that overrides that one. Cut.“The lines are a portrayal of the dance. Cut from the void, not frombewilderment. Cut the enemy as quickly and directly as possible. Cut withcertainty. Cut decisively, resolutely. Cut into his strength. Flow through thegaps in his guard. Cut him. Cut him down utterly. Don’t allow him a breath.Crush him. Cut him without mercy to the depths of his spirit.“It is the balance to life: death. It is the dance with death.“It is the law a war wizard lives by, or he dies.”The dance was art. It was no different, really, from carving. Art expressedthrough a blade. It was all one and the same to him. He saw no distinction, forwithin him, there was none.They shared the meadow with a red fox who hunted it for rodents, mostly, butwasn’t averse to chewing on whatever juicy bugs she could catch there. Theirhorses didn’t mind the fox so much, but they didn’t like the coyotes thatsometimes visited. Kahlan rarely saw them, but she knew they were about when thehorses snorted their displeasure. She often heard the coyotes barking at night,higher up in the surrounding slopes. They would let out long flat howls,followed by a series of yips. Some nights, the wolves sang, their long monotonehowls, without the yapping of the coyotes, echoing through the mountains. OnceKahlan saw a black bear off in the trees, ambling along, giving them only apassing look, and once a bobcat passed near their house, sending the horses offin a panic. It took Richard the better part of a day to find the horses.Chipmunks begged at their door, and regularly invited themselves into the housefor a look around. Kahlan often caught herself talking to them and askingquestions as if they could understand her every word. The way they paused andcocked their heads at her made her suspect they really could. In the earlymornings, small herds of deer often visited the meadow, some leaving fresh,inverted heart-shaped tracks near the door as they passed. Lately, aggressivebucks in rut, bearing huge racks, had been showing up. One of the hides Kahlanwore was from a wolf injured by one of those bucks up in an oak grove not faraway. Richard had spared the wounded animal a lingering, suffering death.Beside the sword fights, they went on marches up into the mountains to helpKahlan strengthen her limbs. Those walks were taxing on her leg muscles,sometimes leaving her so sore she couldn’t sleep. Richard would rub oil into herfeet, calves, and thighs when they hurt too much for her to sleep. That usuallyworked, relaxing her and making her drowsy and able to fall asleep.She distinctly remembered the rainy night after walking home in the wet andcold, when she lay on her back in bed, eyes shut, as Richard rubbed warm oilinto her leg muscles. He whispered that her legs finally seemed to have gottenback all their tone and shape. Kahlan looked up and saw desire in his eyes. Itwas an almost forgotten thrill to know his hunger for her. She had been sostartled that she felt tears trickle down her cheeks with the joy of suddenlyfeeling like a woman again-a desirable woman.Richard raised her leg to his mouth and gently kissed her bare ankle. By thetime his soft warm kisses reached her thighs, she was panting with suddenly andunexpectedly awakened desire. He laid open her nightshirt and rubbed the warmoil on her exposed belly. His big hands moved up her body to caress her breasts.He breathed through his mouth as he rolled her nipples until they were hardbetween his finger and thumb.“Why, Lord Rahl,” she said in a breathy whisper, “I do believe you are going toget carried away.”He paused, seeming to check himself and what he was doing, and then pulled back.“I won’t break, Richard,” she said as she caught his hand and pulled it back.“I’m all right, now. I’d like it if you got carried away.”She clutched his hair in her fists as his kisses covered her breasts and thenher shoulders and then worked up her neck. His panting warmed her ear. Hisexploring fingers made her frantic with need. His body against hers felt wildlyerotic. She no longer felt weary. Finally, he tenderly kissed her lips. She lethim know by the way she returned the kiss that he needn’t be all that tender.As the rain drummed on the roof, as lightning lit the lines and theclenched-fist strength of the statue in the window and thunder rumbled throughthe mountains, Kahlan, without fearing it, without worrying about it, withoutwondering if she would be able, held Richard tightly as they made quiet, gentle,fierce love. They had never needed each other as much as that night. All herfears and worries evaporated in the heat of overpowering need welling up throughher. She wept with the strength of her pleasure and the release of her emotions.When later Richard lay in her arms, she felt a tear roll off his face, and sheasked him if something was wrong. He shook his head and said distantly that hehad for so long feared losing her that sometimes he had believed he might gomad. It seemed as if he could finally allow himself release from his privateterror. The pain Kahlan had first seen in his eyes when she couldn’t rememberhis name was at last banished.Their marches into the mountains ranged farther and farther. Sometimes they tookpacks and spent the night in the woods, often in a wayward pine, when they couldfind one. The rugged terrain offered a never-ending variety of vistas. Inplaces, sheer rock cliffs towered over them. In other places, they stood at thebrink of sheer drops and watched the sun turn the sky orange and purple as itwent down while wispy clouds drifted through quiet green valleys below. Theywent to towering waterfalls with their own rainbows. There were clear, sunlitpools up in the mountains where they swam. They ate on rocks overlooking ruggedsights no one but they ever saw. They followed animal trails through vast woodsof gnarled trees, and others among the dark forest floor where grew trees withtrunks like huge brown columns, so big twenty men couldn’t have joined handsaround them.Richard had Kahlan practice with a bow to help strengthen her arms. They huntedsmall game for stews, or for roasting. Some they smoked and dried along with thefish they caught. Richard usually didn’t eat meat, but occasionally he did. Noteating meat was part of the balance needed by his gift for when he was forced tokill. That need of balance was lessening because he wasn’t killing. He was atpeace. Perhaps the balance was now being served by his carving. As time passed,he was able to eat more meat. When they were out on journeys, they usually aterice and beans along with bannock and any berries they collected along the way,in addition to game they caught.Kahlan helped clean fish and salt them down and smoke yet others for theirwinter stores. It was a job that she had never before undertaken. They collectedberries, nuts, and wild apples and put a lot of those away in the root cellaralong with root crops he had purchased before coming up into the mountains.Richard dug up small apple trees, when he found any, and planted them in themeadow by the house so that, he said, someday they would have apples close athand.Kahlan wondered how long he intended to keep them away from where they wereneeded. The silent question always hung there, seen by all, but unspoken. Caranever asked him, but she sometimes made some small mention of it to Kahlan whenthey were alone. She was Lord Rahl’s guard, and glad to be close at hand, so shegenerally offered no objection. He was, after all, Lord Rahl, and he was safe.Kahlan had always felt the weight of their responsibilities. Like the toweringmountains all around, looming over them, always shadowing them, thatresponsibility could never be completely forgotten. As much as she loved thehouse Richard had built on the edge of the meadow, and as much as she lovedexploring the rugged beautiful, imposing, and ever-changing mountains, with eachpassing day she more and more felt that weight and the anxious need to be backwhere they were needed most. She fretted at what could be going on that theyweren’t aware of. The Imperial Order was not going to stay put; an army thatsize liked to move. Soldiers, especiallysoldiers of that ilk, became restless inlong encampments, and sooner or later started causing trouble. She worried aboutall the people who needed the reassurance of Richard’s presence, hisguidance-and hers. There were people who their whole lives had depended on theMother Confessor always being there to stand up for them.With winter coming on, Richard had made Kahlan a warm mantle, mostly out of wolffur. The other two pelts were coyotes. Richard had found one of the coyotes witha broken leg, probably from a fall, and had put it out of its misery. The otherhad been a rogue chased off by the local pack. It had taken to raiding food fromtheir little smokehouse. Richard had taken the sly looter with a single arrow.They had collected most of the wolf pelts from injured or old animals. Richard,Kahlan, and Cara often tracked wolf packs as a way of helping to build Kahlan’sstrength. Kahlan came to recognize their tracks, and even learned to know at aglance, if the prints were in mud or soft dirt, their front paws from the rear.Richard showed her how the toes of the front spread out more, with a morewelldefined heel pad than the rear paw. He had located several packs in themountains, and the three of them often followed one group or family to see ifthey could do so without the wolves knowing. Richard said it was a kind of gameguides used to play to keep in practice-to keep their senses sharp.After Kahlan’s mantle was completed, they had turned to collecting pelts forCara’s winter fur. Cara, who always wore the clothes of her profession, hadliked the idea of Lord Rahl making something for her to wear-the same as he hadmade for Kahlan. While she had never said as much, Kahlan had always felt thatCara saw the mantle he was making for her as a mark of his feelings, hisrespect-proof that she was more than just his bodyguard.This had been a journey to find pelts for Cara’s mantle, and she had been eager.She had even cooked for them.Now, coming down off the ridge where Kahlan had finally bested Richard in asword fight, Kahlan was in a good mood. For the last two days they had beenfollowing the wolf pack up in the mountains to the west of their house. It wasnot simply a hunt, and not simply to get a pelt for Cara, but part of thenever-ending pressure Richard put on Kahlan to keep up.Almost every day for the last two months, Richard had her marching over the mostdifficult terrain, the kind of terrain that made her strain every muscle in herbody. As Kahlan had gotten stronger, the marches had gotten longer. At firstthey were only across the house; now they were across mountains. On top of that,he frequently attacked her with his willow sword and poked fun at her if shedidn’t put in her absolute hardest fight.In a way, finally beating Richard in one of their mock sword fights puzzled her.He might have been tired from carrying the heaviest pack and scouting some ofthe steeper trails by himself first and then coming back for them, but he hadn’tslacked off, and she had still killed him. She couldn’t help but be pleased withherself, even if she did question her victory. Out of the corner of her eye, shehad caught him smiling as he looked at her. Kahlan knew Richard was proud of herfor besting him. In a way, his losing was a victory for him.Kahlan thought that she must be stronger, now, after all Richard had put herthrough, than at any time in her life. It had not been easy, but it had beenworth at last feeling like the carving in the window of her bedroom.Kahlan put a hand on Richard’s shoulder as he followed Cara down broken graniteblocks placed by chance like big, irregular steps. “Richard, how did I beatyou?”He saw in her eyes the seriousness of the question. “You killed me because Imade a mistake.”“A mistake? You mean, perhaps you had gotten too confident? Perhaps you werejust tired, or were thinking of something else.”“Doesn’t really matter, does it? Whatever it was, it was a mistake that cost memy life in the game. In a real fight, I would have died. You’ve taught me avaluable lesson to redouble my resolve to always put in my absolute full effort.It just goes to remind me, though, that I could make a mistake at any time, andlose.”Kahlan couldn’t help but to be struck by the obvious question: was he making amistake in staying out of the effort to keep the Midlands free from the tyrannyof the Imperial Order? She couldn’t help feeling the pull to help her people,even though Richard still felt that if the people didn’t want his leadership,his efforts could do no good. As Mother Confessor, Kahlan knew that while peopledidn’t always understand that what a leader did was done in their best interest,that was no reason to abandon them.With winter coming on, she hoped the Imperial Order would choose to stay put inAnderith. Kahlan needed to convince Richard to return to help the Midlands, butshe was at a loss to know how. He was firm in his reasoning, and she could findno chink in the armor of his logic. Emotion did not sway him in this.Cara led them down the craggy precipice, having to backtrack only twice. It wasa difficult descent. Cara was pleased with herself, and that Richard had let herpick the route. It was her pelt they were going after, so he let her lead themacross the tangle of undergrowth in the ravine at the bottom and then up thefollowing lip of the notch where trees clung with roots like talons to the rockyrise.The wind coming up the ravine had turned bitter. The clouds had thickened untilthey snuffed out the golden rays of sunlight. Their ascent took them up into agloomy, dark wood of towering evergreens. Far over their heads, the treetopsswayed in the wind, but down on the ground, it was still. Their footfalls werehushed by a thick spongy mat of brown needles.The climb was steep, but not arduous. As they ascended, the big trees grewfarther and farther apart. The boughs became scraggly, allowing more of thesomber light to seep in. For the most part, the rocks higher up were bare ofmoss and leaves. In places they had to use handholds on the rock, or else roots,to help them climb. Kahlan pulled deep breaths of the cold air; it felt good totest her muscles.They came out of the forest into the steel-gray light of late afternoon and themoaning voice of the wind. They were in the crooked wood.The scree and rock were naked of the thick moss common lower down the mountain,but they bore yellow-green splotches of lichen outlined in black. Only a bit ofscraggly brush clung to the low places here and there. But it was the trees thatwere the most odd, and gave the place at the top of the tree line its name. Theywere all stunted-few taller than Kahlan or Richard. Most of the branches grew toone side because of the prevailing winds, leaving the trees looking likegrotesque, running skeletons frozen in torment.Above the crooked wood, few things other than sedges and lichens grew. Abovethat, the snowcap held sway.“Here it is,” Cara said.They found the wolf sprawled on the scree beside a low boulder with a dark stainof dried blood at the sharp edge. Up higher, the pack of gray wolves had beentrying to take down a woodland caribou. The old bull had grazed the unlucky wolfwith a kick. That in itself would likely not have been anything more thanpainful, but the wolf had slipped from the higher ledge and fallen to its death.Kahlan ran her fingers through the thick, yellow-gray coat tipped in black. Itwas in good condition, and would be a warm addition to Cara’s winter mantle.Richard and Cara started skinning the good-sized female animal as Kahlan wentout to the edge of an overhang. She drew her own mantle up around her ears asshe stood in the bitter wind surveying the approaching clouds. She was somewhatstartled by what she saw.“Richard, it’s not drizzle coming our way,” Kahlan said. “It’s snow.”He looked up from his bloody work. “Do you see any wayward pines down in thevalley?”She squinted down to the valley floor spread out before her.“Yes, I see a couple. The snow is still a ways off. If you’re not long at that,we can probably make it down there and collect some wood before it gets wet.”“We’re almost done,” Cara said.Richard stood to have a quick look for himself. With a bloody hand, he absentlyfifted his real sword a few inches and then let it drop back, a habit he had ofchecking to make sure the weapon was clear in its scabbard. It was an unsettlinggesture. He had not drawn the weapon from its hilt since the day he had beenforced to kill all those men who had attacked them back near Hartland.“Is something wrong?”“What?” Richard saw where her eyes were looking and glanced down at the sword onhis hip. “Oh. No, nothing. Just habit, I guess.”Kahlan pointed. “There’s a wayward pine, there. It’s the closest, andgood-sized, too.”Richard wiped the back of his wrist across his brow, swiping his hair away fromhis eyes. His fingers glistened with blood. “We’ll be down there, sheltered by awayward pine, sitting beside a cozy fire having tea before dark. I can stretchthe hide on the branches inside and scrape it there. The snow will help insulateus inside the tree’s boughs. We’ll have a good rest before heading back in themorning. Down a little lower, it will only be rain.”Kahlan snuggled her cheek inside her wolf fur as a shiver tingled through hershoulders and up the back of her neck. Winter had snuck up on them."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20When they arrived home two days later, the little fish in the jars were alldead. They had used the same easier route over the pass that they had originallyused to enter the valley when they had first come in with the horses, monthsbefore. Of course, Kahlan didn’t recall that trip; she had been unconscious. Itseemed a lifetime ago.There was now a shorter trail to their home, one they had blazed down from thepass. They could have used that alternative route, but it was narrow anddifficult and would have saved them only ten or fifteen minutes. They had beenout for days, and as they had wearily stood in the windswept notch at the top ofthe pass looking down at their cozy home far below at the edge of the meadow,they had decided to take the easier passage, even though it took a littlelonger. It had been a relief to finally get inside the house, out of the wind,and drop all their gear.As Richard brought in firewood and Cara fetched water, Kahlan pulled out alittle square of cloth with some small bugs she’d caught earlier that day,intending to give her fish a treat, since they were sure to be hungry. She letout a little groan when she saw that they were dead.“What’s the matter?” Cara asked as she walked in lugging a full bucket. She cameover to see the fish.“Looks like they starved,” Kahlan told her.“Little fish like that don’t often live long in a jar,” Richard said as he kneltand started stacking birch logs atop kindling in the fireplace.“But they did live a long time,” Kahlan said, as if to prove him wrong andsomehow talk him out of it.“You didn’t name them, did you? I told you not to name them because they woulddie after a time. I warned you not to let yourself get emotionally attached whenit can only come to no good end.”“Cara named one.”“Did not,” Cara protested. “I was just trying to show you which one I wastalking about, that’s all.”After the flames took from his flint, Richard looked up and smiled. “Well, I’llget you some more.”Kahlan yawned. “But these were the best ones. They needed me.”Richard snorted a laugh. “You’ve got quite the imagination. They only dependedon us because we artificially altered their lives. Just like the chipmunks wouldstop hunting seeds for their winter stores if we gave them handouts all thetime. Of course, the fish had no choice, because we kept them in jars. Left totheir own initiative, the fish wouldn’t need any help from us. After all, ittook a net to catch them. I’ll catch you some more, and they’ll come to need youjust as much.”Two days later, on a thinly overcast day, after they’d had a big lunch of thickrabbit stew with turnips and onions along with bread Cara had made, Richard wentoff to check the fishing lines and to catch some more of the blacknose daceminnows.After he’d left, Cara picked up their spoons and put them in the bucket of washwater on the counter.“You know,” she said, looking back over her shoulder, “I like it here, I reallydo, but it’s starting to make me jumpy.”Kahlan scraped the plates off into a wooden bowl with the cooking leavings forthe midden heap. “Jumpy?” She brought the plates to the counter. “What do youmean?”“Mother Confessor, this place is nice enough, but it’s starting to make me godaft. I am Mord-Sith. Dear spirits, I’m starting to name fish in jars!” Caraturned back to the bucket and bent to cleaning the spoons with a washcloth.“Don’t you think it’s about time we convinced Lord Rahl that we need to getback?”Kahlan sighed. She loved their home in the mountains, and she loved the quietand solitude. Most of all, she treasured the time she and Richard were able tospend together without other people making demands of them. But she also missedthe activity of Aydindril, the company of people, and the sights of cities andcrowds. There was a lot not to like about being in places like that, but therewas an excitement about it, too.She’d had a lifetime to become used to the way people didn’t always want orunderstand her help, and forging ahead anyway because she knew it was in theirbest interest. Richard never had to learn to face that cold indifference and goabout his duty despite it.“Of course I do, Cara.” Kahlan placed the bowl of scraps on a shelf, remindingherself to empty it later. She wondered if she was to be a Mother Confessor whoforever lived in the woods, away from her people, a people struggling for theirliberty. “But you know how Richard feels. He thinks it would be wrong-more thanthat, he thinks it would be irresponsible to give in to such a wish when reasontells him he must not.”Cara’s blue eyes flashed with determination. “You are the Mother Confessor.Break the spell of this place. Tell him that you are needed back there, and thatyou are going to return. What’s he going to do? Tie you to a tree? If you leave,he will follow. He will have to return, then.”Kahlan shook her head emphatically. “No, I can’t do that. Not after what he’stold us. That’s not the kind of thing you do to a person you respect. I may notexactly agree with him, but I understand his reasons and know him well enough todread that he’s right.”“But going back doesn’t mean he would have to lead our side. You would only bemaking him follow you back, not making him return to leadership.” Cara smirked.“But maybe when he sees how much he is needed, he will come to his senses.”“That’s part of the reason he’s brought us so far out in the mountains: he fearsthat if he’s near the struggle, or if he goes back, he will see all that’shappening and be drawn in. I can’t use his feelings for me to force him intosuch a corner. Even if we did go back and he resisted the temptation to helppeople fighting for their lives and wasn’t drawn into the struggle against thebrutality of the Imperial Order, such an overt act of coercion on my part wouldcreate an enduring rift between us.”Kahlan shook her head again. “This is something he believes too strongly. Iwon’t force him into returning.”Cara gestured with the dripping washcloth. “Maybe he doesn’t really believe it,not really, not deep down inside. Maybe he doesn’t want to go back because hedoubts himself-over the Anderith thing-and so he thinks it’s just easier for himto stay away.”“I don’t believe Richard doubts himself in this. Not in this. Not for a second.Not one tiny little bit. I think that if he had any doubt whatsoever, he wouldreturn, because that is really the easier path. Staying away is harder-as youand I can attest.“But you can leave at any time, Cara, if you feel so strongly about going back.He has no claim on your life. You don’t have to stay here if you don’t wish to.”“I am sworn to follow him no matter what foolish thing he does.”“Foolish? You follow him because you believe in him. So do I. That’s why I couldnever walk away, forcing him to follow.”Cara pressed her lips tight. Her blue eyes lost their fire as she turned awayand flopped the cloth back into the bucket of water. “Then we will be stuckhere, condemned to live out our lives in paradise.”Kahlan smiled in understanding of Cara’s frustration. While she wouldn’t try toforce Richard into something he was dead set against, that didn’t preclude herfrom trying to change his mind. She drained her teacup and plunked it down onthe counter. That would be different.“Maybe not. You know, I’ve been thinking the same thing-that we need to go back,I mean.”Cara peered over with a suspicious sidelong glance. “So, what do you think wecan do to convince him?”“Richard is going to be gone for a while. Without him here to bother us, howabout we have a bath?”“A bath?”“Yes, a bath. I’ve been thinking about how much I’d like to get cleaned up. I’mtired of looking like a backcountry traveler. I’d like to wash my hair and puton my white Mother Confessor’s dress.”“Your white Mother Confessor’s dress . . .” Cara smiled conspiratorially. “Ah.Now that will be the kind of battle a woman is better equipped to fight.”Out of the corner of her eye, Kahlan could see Spirit standing in the bedroomwindow, looking out at the world, her robes flowing in the wind, her head thrownback, her back arched, her fists at her sides in defiance of anything that wouldthink to bridle her.“Well, not exactly a battle the way you’re thinking, but I believe I can statethe case better if I’m dressed properly. That wouldn’t be unfair. I will beputting the issue to him as the Mother Confessor. I believe that in some wayshis judgment has been clouded; it’s hard to think about anything else whenyou’re worried sick about someone you love.”Kahlan’s fists tightened at her sides as she thought about the danger hangingover the Midlands. “He’s got to see that all of that is in the past, that I’mhealthy, now, and that the time has come to return to our duties to our people.”Smirking, Cara swiped back a wisp of her blond hair. “He will see that, andmore, if you were in that dress of yours, that’s for sure.”“I want him to see the woman who was strong enough to win against him with asword. I want him to see that Mother Confessor in the dress, too.”From the corner of her mouth, Cara puffed another strand of hair off her face.“To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t mind a bath myself. You know, I think that ifI stand beside you in a proper Mord-Sith outfit and my hair is washed and mybraid is done up fresh and I’m looking properly Mord-Sith-like and I speak myagreement with what you say, Lord Rahl will be all the more convinced that we’reright and inclined to see that the time has come for us to return.”Kahlan set the plates into the bucket of water. “It’s settled, then. We’veenough time before he comes back.”Richard had made them a small wooden tub, big enough to sit in and have a nicebath. It wasn’t big enough to lie back and luxuriate in, but it was still quitethe luxury for their mountain home.Cara towed the tub from the corner, leaving drag marks across the dirt floor.“I’ll put it in my room. You go first. That way, if he comes back sooner ratherthan later, you can keep your nosy husband busy and out of my hair while I washit.”Together, Kahlan and Cara hauled in buckets of water from the nearby spring,heating some in a kettle over a roaring fire. When Kahlan finally sank into thesteaming water, she let out a long sigh. The air was chilly, and the hot bathfelt all the better for it. She would have liked to linger, but decided not to.She smiled at recalling all the trouble Richard had had with women in bathwater.It was a good thing he wasn’t there. Later, after they had their talk, shethought she would ask him to take a bath before bed. She liked the aroma of hissweat when it was clean sweat.With the knowledge that she would face Richard with her hair washed andsparkling, and in her white dress, Kahlan felt more confident about the realpossibility of their return than she had in a long time. She dried and brushedher hair by the heat of the fire as Cara boiled some more water. While Cara wentin to take her bath, Kahlan went to her room to slip into her dress. Most peoplefeared the dress because they feared the woman who wore it; Richard had alwaysliked her in the dress.As she tossed the towel on the bed, her eye was caught by the statue in thewindow. Kahlan fisted her hands at her sides and, standing naked, arched herback and threw her head back, mimicking Spirit, letting the feeling of itovercome her, letting herself be that strong spirit, letting it flow throughher.For that moment, she was the spirit of the statue.This was a day of change. She could feel it.It seemed a little odd, after being a woods woman for so long, to be back in herMother Confessor’s dress, to feel the satiny smooth material against her skin.Mostly, though, the feeling was the comfort of the familiar.As Mother Confessor, Kahlan felt sure of herself. On a fundamental level, thedress was a form of battle armor. Wearing the dress, Kahlan also felt a sense ofimportance, in that she carried the weight of history, of exceptional women whohad gone before her. The Mother Confessor bore a terrible responsibility, butalso had the satisfaction of being able to make a real difference for the betterin people’s lives.Those people depended on her. Kahlan had a job to do, and she had to convinceRichard that she needed to do it. They needed him, too, but even if he would notissue orders, he needed to at least willingly return with her. Those fightingfor their cause deserved to know the Mother Confessor was with them, and thatshe had not lost faith in them or their cause. She had to make Richard see thatmuch of it.Once she was back out in the main room, Kahlan could hear Cara splashing in thetub. “Need anything, Cara?” she called out.“No, I’m fine,” Cara called from her room. “This feels so good! I think there’senough dirt in this water to plant potatoes.”Kahlan laughed knowingly. She saw a chipmunk casting about outside the house.“I’m going to go feed Chippy some apple cores. If you need anything, call out.”Their universal name for all the chipmunks was “Chippy.” They all answered toit; they knew the name augured well for a handout.“All right,” Cara said from her tub. “If Lord Rahl gets back, though, just kisshim or something to keep him busy but wait until I’m done before you talk tohim. I want to be with you to help you convince him. I want to be sure we makehim see the light.”Kahlan smiled. “I promise.”She plucked an apple core from the wooden bucket of little animal snacks theykept hanging on a piece of twine where the chipmunks couldn’t get to them ontheir own. The squirrels loved apple cores, too. The horses preferred theirapples whole.“Here, Chippy,” Kahlan called out through the door in the voice she always usedwith them. She raised the bucket back toward the ceiling and hooked the line tothe peg on the wall. “Chip, Chip, you want an apple?”Outside, Kahlan saw the chipmunk off to the side, foraging through the grass.The chill breeze caressed the long folds of her dress to her legs as she walked.It was almost cold enough to need the fur mantle. The bare branches of the oaksbehind the house creaked and groaned as they rubbed together. The pines,reaching toward the sky where the wind was stronger, bowed deeply with some ofthe gusts. The sun had taken refuge behind a steel-gray overcast that made herwhite dress all the more striking in the gloom.Near the window where Spirit stood watching out, Kahlan called the chipmunkagain. The chipmunks were held spellbound by the soft voice Kahlan used when shetalked to them. When he heard her, the furry little striped creature stood onhis hind legs for a moment, stiff and still, checking that all was clear, andwhen he was sure it was safe, scurried to her. Kahlan squatted and rolled theapple core out of her hand onto the ground.“Here you go, sweetheart,” she cooed. “A nice apple for you.”Chippy wasted no time starting in on his treat. Kahlan’s cheeks hurt fromsmiling at the way the chipmunk nibbled his way around the apple core as itrolled along the ground. She rose to her feet, brushing her hands clean as shewatched, captivated by the little creature at his feverish work.He suddenly flinched with a squeak and froze.Kahlan looked up. She was staring right into a woman’s blue eyes.The woman stood not ten feet away in a pose of cool scrutiny. Kahlan’s throatlocked the gasp in her lungs. The woman had seemed to appear in the middle ofnowhere, out of nowhere. Icy gooseflesh prickled up the backs of Kahlan’s arms.The woman’s long blond hair cascaded over the shoulders of an exquisite blackdress. She was of such shapely beauty, her face of such pure perfection, butespecially her eyes were of such intelligent lucid witnesses to all around her,that she could only be a creature of profound integrity . . . or unspeakableevil.Kahlan knew without doubt which it was.This woman made Kahlan feel as ugly as a clod of dirt, and instinctively ashelpless as a child. She wanted nothing so much as to shrink away. Instead, shestared into the woman’s blue eyes for what couldn’t have been more than a secondor two, but in that span of time an eternity seemed to pass. In those knowingblue eyes flowed some formidable, frightful current of contemplation.Kahlan remembered Captain Meiffert’s description of this woman. For the life ofher, though, Kahlan couldn’t just then recall her name. It seemed trivial. Whatmattered was that this woman was a Sister of the Dark.Without speaking a word, the woman lifted her hands out a little and turned herpalms up, as if humbly offering something. Her hands were empty.Kahlan committed to the vault through space necessary to close the distance. Shecommitted to unleashing her power. With her resolution, the act had in a wayalready commenced. But she desperately needed to get closer if it was to bemeaningful, or effective.As she began to move, to make that reckless leap, the world went white in abloom of pain."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21Richard heard an odd sound that stopped him in his tracks. He felt a thumpthrough the ground and deep in his chest. He thought he’d seen a flash in thetreetops, but it had been so quick he wasn’t sure.It was the sound, though, as if some great hammer had struck off the top of amountain, that made his blood go cold.The house wasn’t far off through the trees. He dropped the string of trout andthe jar of minnows, and ran.At the edge of the woods where it opened into the meadow, he skidded to a halt.His pounding heart felt as if it had risen up into his throat.Richard saw the two women not far away, in front of the house, one dressed inwhite, and one in black. They were connected by a snaking, undulating, cracklingline of milky white light. Nicci’s arms were lifted slightly with her handsturned palms up and a little farther apart than the width of her hips.The milky light went from Nicci’s chest, across the space between the two women,and pierced Kahlan through the heart. The wavering aurora between the two turnedblindingly bright, as if twisting in an agony it was unable to escape.Seeing Kahlan trembling with the fury of that lance of light pinning her to thewall, Richard was paralyzed by fear for her, fear he knew all too well, fromwhen she had been on the cusp of death. That bolt pierced Nicci’s heart, too,connecting the two women. Richard didn’t understand the magic Nicci was using,but he instinctively recognized it as profoundly dangerous, not only to Kahlan,but to Nicci as well, for she, too, was in pain. That Nicci would put herself atsuch risk gripped him with dread.Richard knew he had to remain calm and keep his wits about himself if Kahlan wasto have a chance. He viscerally wanted to do something to strike Nicci down, buthe was certain that it wouldn’t be as simple as that. Zedd’s oft-repeatedexpression-nothing is ever easy-flashed into Richard’s mind with sudden andtangible meaning.In a desperate search for answers, everything Richard knew about magic cascadedin a torrent through his mind. None of it told him what to do, but it did tellhim what he must not do. Kahlan’s life hung in the balance.Just then, Cara came flying out of the house. She was stark naked. It somehowdidn’t look all that odd. Richard was accustomed to the shape of her body in herskintight leather outfits. Other than the color, this didn’t look all thatdifferent. She was dripping wet. Her hair was undone, which seemed moreoutlandishly indecent to him than her naked body. He was used to seeing her witha braid all the time.Cara’s fist clutched the red leather rod-her Agiel-as she crouched. The musclesof her legs, arms, and shoulders strained with tension demanding release.“Cara! No!” Richard cried out.He was already tearing across the meadow as Cara sprang and slammed her Agielagainst the side of Nicci’s neck.Nicci shrieked in pain that dropped her to her knees. Kahlan cried out in equalpain and crumpled to her knees as well, her movement a close match to Nicci’s.Cara seized Nicci’s hair in a fist and yanked her head back. “Time to die,witch!”Nicci was doing nothing to stop Cara as the Agiel hung only inches from herthroat.Richard dove toward the Mord-Sith, desperately hoping he wouldn’t be too late.Cara’s Agiel just grazed Nicci’s throat as Richard tackled her around themiddle, ramming her backward. The feel of her was briefly surprising-silky softflesh over iron-hard muscle. The impact drove the wind from her when they hitthe ground.Cara was so enraged and in such a combative state that she lashed out with herAgiel at Richard, not really realizing it was him, knowing only that she wasbeing prevented from protecting Kahlan.The violent impact of the weapon to the side of Richard’s face felt like a blowby an iron bar followed immediately by a lightning strike. The crack of painthrough his skull was momentarily blinding. His ears rang. The jolt took hisbreath, staggering him, and brought back in a single instant an avalanche ofmacabre memories.Cara was riveted on the kill and furious at any interference. Richard regainedhis senses just in time to seize her wrists and pin her to the ground before shecould pounce on Nicci. A Mord-Sith was formidable, to be sure, but such a womanwas instilled with the ability to counter magic, not muscle. That was why shehad been trying to goad Nicci into using her power; only in that way could shecapture the enemy’s magic and so overpower her.Cara’s writhing naked body under him hardly registered in Richard’s mind. Hetasted blood in his mouth. His attention was focused on her Agiel and makingsure she couldn’t use it on him. His head throbbed with a painful ringing, andhe had to fight not only Cara, but encroaching unconsciousness. It was all hecould do to hold Cara down.At that moment, the Mord-Sith was more of a threat to Kahlan’s life than Nicciwas. If Nicci intended to kill Kahlan, he was sure she could have already doneso. Richard might not have understood specifically what Nicci was doing, but bywhat he had already seen, he grasped the general nature of it.Blood dripped down onto Cara’s bare chest, vivid red against the expanse of herwhite skin.“Cara, stop!” His jaw worked, if painfully, so he reasoned it wasn’t broken.“It’s me. Stop. You’ll kill Kahlan.” Cara stilled under him, staring up in angryconfusion. “What you do to Nicci happens to Kahlan, too.”“You had better listen to him,” Nicci said from behind him in that velvety voiceof hers.Cara reached up when Richard released her wrists and touched the side of hismouth. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, realizing what she had done. Her tone toldhim she meant it. Richard nodded and then stood, pulling her up by her handbefore rounding on Nicci.Nicci stood tall, in that proud and proper posture she had. Her attention andher magic was focused on Kahlan. The calm but violent power from within him hadawakened, waiting to be commanded. Richard didn’t know how to use it to stopNicci. He held back, fearing that anything he did would only make Kahlan’s perilworse.Kahlan was on her feet, too, but once again pinned to the wall of the house bythe milky rope of light. Her green eyes were wide with the trembling torment ofwhatever it was Nicci was doing.Nicci’s hands lifted. She laid her palms to her heart, over the light. Her backwas to Richard, but he could see the light through her, like fire eating throughthe center of a piece of paper, the incandescent hole expanding outward,appearing to consume her. The twisting flare of light was doing the same thingto Kahlan, seeming to burn through her, yet Richard could see that she was notbeing killed by it. She was still breathing, still moving, still alive-notreacting at all the way a person would if they were really having holes burnedthrough them. With magic, he knew better than to believe his eyes.At the center of Nicci’s chest, under her hands, she began to become solidagain, re-forming where the light had spent itself in glowing rays working outtoward the edges of her.The light cut off. Kahlan, her own hands pressed to the wall behind her, saggedin relief as it extinguished, her eyes closing as if it was too much to endurelooking at the woman standing before her.Richard was restrained fury. His muscles screamed to be released. The magicwithin was a coiled viper waiting to strike. He wanted almost more than anythingto cut down this woman. The only thing he wanted more was for Kahlan to be safe.Nicci smiled pleasantly at Kahlan before turning to Richard. Her calm blue eyesmomentarily took in his white-knuckled fist on the hilt of his sword.“Richard. It’s been a long time. You look well.”“What have you done?” He growled through gritted teeth.She smiled. It was a smile a mother gave a child-a smile of indulgence. She tooka breath, as if recovering from a difficult bit of labor, and lifted a hand toindicate Kahlan.“I have spelled your wife, Richard.”Richard could hear Cara’s breath close behind his left shoulder. She was stayingout of the way of his sword arm.“To what end?” he asked.“Why, to capture you, of course.”“What’s going to happen to her? What harm have you done?”“Harm? Why, none. Any harm that comes to her will only be by your hand.”Richard frowned, understanding her, but wishing he were wrong. “You mean, if Ihurt you, Kahlan will suffer it, too?”Nicci smiled with the same discerning, disarming smile she used to have when shecame to give him lessons. He could hardly believe that he used to imagine thatshe must look like nothing so much as a good spirit in the flesh.Richard could sense the magic crackling around this woman. He had come to knowin most cases, through his own gift, when a person had the gift. What otherscouldn’t see, he saw. He could see it in their eyes, and sometimes sense theaura of it around them. He had rarely met gifted women who made the very airabout them sizzle with their power. Worse, though, Nicci was a Sister of theDark.“Yes, and more. Much more. You see, we are now linked by a maternity spell. Oddname for a spell, yes? The name, in part, is derived from the spell’s nurturingaspects. As in lifegiver-the way a mother nurtures her child and keeps it alive.“That light you saw was an umbilical cord of sorts: an umbilical cord of magic.By bending the nature of this world, it links our lives, no matter the distancebetween us. Just as I am the daughter of my mother and nothing could ever changethat, so neither can this magic be altered by anyone else.”She spoke as an instructor, as she had once spoken to him at the Palace of theProphets when she had been one of his teachers. She always spoke with a quieteconomy of words that he had once thought added an air of nobility to herbearing. Back then, Richard couldn’t have imagined coarse words coming fromNicci’s mouth, but the words she spoke now were vile.She still moved with an unmatched, slow elegance. He had always thought hermovements seductive. He now saw them as the sinuous movements of a snake.The magic of his sword thundered through him, screaming to be loosed. Thesword’s magic had been created specifically to combat what the sword’s wielderconsidered evil. At that moment, Nicci fit the requirement to such an extentthat the magic of the sword was close to overpowering him, near to takingcommand in order to destroy this threat. With the pain from the Agiel stillthrobbing in his head, it was a struggle to maintain his control over the powerof the sword. Richard could feel the raised gold letters of the word TRUTH onthe hilt pressing into his palm.This was a time, perhaps more than any other, that he knew had to be faced withtruth, and not his raw wishes. Life and death hung in the balance.“Richard,” Kahlan said in a level voice. She waited until his eyes met hers.“Kill her.” She spoke with a quiet authority that demanded obedience. In herwhite Mother Confessor’s dress, her words carried the unequivocal weight ofcommand. “Do it. Don’t wait another moment. Kill her. Don’t think about it, doit.”Nicci calmly watched to see what he might do. What he would finally decideseemed no more than a matter of curiosity to her. Richard had no need to thinkor to decide.“I can’t,” he said to Kahlan. “That would kill you, too.”Nicci lifted one eyebrow. “Very good, Richard. Very good.”“Do it!” Kahlan shrieked. “Do it now, while you still have the chance!”“Keep still,” he said in a calm voice. He looked back at Nicci. “Let’s hear it.”She clasped her hands in the way the Sisters of the Light were wont to do. Onlyshe was not a Sister of the Light. There looked to be something deeply feltbehind that blue-eyed gaze, but what those feelings could be, he didn’t know andfeared to imagine. It was one of those intense gazes that held a world ofemotion, everything from longing to hatred. One thing he was sure he saw was adead serious determination that was more important to her than life itself.“It’s like this, Richard. You are to come with me. As long as I live, Kahlanwill live. If I die, she dies. It’s as simple as that.”“What else?” he demanded.“What else?” Nicci blinked. “Nothing else.”“What if I decide to kill you?”“Then I will die. But Kahlan will die with me-our lives are now finked.”“That’s not what I mean. I mean, you must have some purpose. What else will itmean if I decide to kill you.”Nicci shrugged. “Nothing. It’s up to you to decide. Our lives are in your hands.Should you choose to preserve her life, you will have to come with me.”“And what do you intend to do with him?” Kahlan asked as she edged her way overto Richard’s side. “Torture a sham confession out of him, so that Jagang can puthim on some kind of show trial followed by a very public execution?”If anything, Nicci looked surprised, as if such a thought had never occurred toher, and she found it abhorrent. “No, none of that. I intend him no harm. Fornow, anyway. Eventually, of course, I will most likely have to kill him.”Richard glared. “Of course.”When Kahlan made a move forward, he caught her arm and restrained her. He knewwhat she intended. He didn’t know exactly what would happen if Kahlan unleasedher Confessor’s power on Nicci while they were both linked by the spell, but hehad no intention of finding out, since he was sure it could come to no good end.Kahlan was far too ready, as far as he was concerned, to forfeit her life tosave his.“Just hold on for now,” he whispered to her.Kahlan threw her arm out, pointing. “She just admitted she intends to kill you!”Nicci smiled reassuringly. “Don’t worry about that for now. If it comes to that,it will not likely be for a long time. Perhaps even a lifetime.”“And in the meantime?” Kahlan asked. “What plans do you have for him before youdiscard his life as if it were insignificant?”“Insignificant . . . ?” Nicci opened her hands in an innocent gesture. “I haveno plans. I expect only to take him away.”Richard had thought he understood what was going on, but he was less and lesssure with everything Nicci said. “You mean, you want to take me away so that Ican’t fight against the Imperial Order?”Her brow twitched. “If you wish to think of it in those terms, I admit it istrue that your time as the leader of the D’Haran Empire is over. But that is notthe point. The point is that everything about your life up until now”-Nicciglanced pointedly at Kahlan-”is over.”Her words seemed to chill the air. They surely chilled Richard.“What’s the rest of it?” He knew there had to be more, something that would makesense of it all. “What other terms are there if I want to keep Kahlan alive?”“Well, no one is to follow us, of course.”“And if we do?” Kahlan snapped. “I might follow you and kill you myself, even ifit means the end of my own life.” Kahlan’s green eyes shone with icy resolve asshe cast a threatening glare on the woman.Nicci lifted her brows deliberately as she leaned ever so slightly towardKahlan, the way a mother would in cautioning a child. “Then that will be the endof it unless Richard stops you from doing such a thing. That is all part of whathe must decide to do. But you make a miscalculation if you think I care one wayor the other. I don’t, you see. Not at all.”“What is it you intend me to do?” Richard said, pulling Nicci,’ s unsettlinglycalm gaze from Kahlan. “What if I get where you’re taking me, and I don’t do asyou wish?”“You misunderstand, Richard, if you believe that I have some preconceived notionof what it is I wish you to do. I don’t. You will do as you wish, I imagine.”“As I wish?”“Well, naturally you won’t be allowed to return to your people.” She tossed herhead, flicking back strands of her long blond hair that the wind had pulledacross in front of her blue eyes. Her gaze never left his. “And I suppose if youwere to be in some way impossibly and defiantly contrary, then in that case,such would obviously be an answer in and of itself. It would be a shame, ofcourse, but I would then have no use for you. I would kill you.”“You would have no further use? You mean Jagang would have no further use.”“No.” Once again, Nicci looked surprised. “I do not act on behalf of HisExcellency.” She tapped her lower lip. “You see? I removed the ring he putthrough my lip marking me as his slave. I do this on behalf of myself.”A yet more disturbing thought surfaced. “How is it that he can’t enter yourmind? That he can’t control you?”“You don’t need me to answer that question, Richard Rahl.”It made no sense to him; the bond to the Lord Rahl worked for those loyal tohim. He could see no way that this could be construed as an act of loyalty. Thiswas unequivocally an act of aggression and against his will; the bond shouldn’twork for her. He reasoned that perhaps Jagang was in her mind and she unaware ofit. The thought occurred to him that maybe Jagang was in her mind, and it haddriven her insane.“Look,” Richard said, feeling like they weren’t even speaking the same language,“I don’t know what you think-”“Enough talk. We are leaving.”Her blue eyes watched him without anger. It almost seemed to Richard that forNicci, Kahlan anal Cara were not there.“This doesn’t make any sense. You want me to go with you, but you aren’t actingon behalf of Jagang. If that’s true, then-”“I believe I’ve made it as clear as possible and quite simple, besides. If youwish to be free, you may kill me at any opportunity. If you do, Kahlan will alsodie. Those are your only two choices. Although I believe I know what you willdo, I am in no way certain. Two paths now lie before you. You must take one.”Richard could hear Cara’s angry breath behind him. She was a coiled spring readyto strike. Fearing she might do something of irredeemable harm, he lifted hishand just to be sure she knew he meant for her to stay behind him.“Oh, and one additional matter, should you think to resort to some plot ortreachery, or, for that matter, refuse to do the simple things I ask of you:through the spell that joins us, I can at any time end Kahlan’s life. I have butto will it. It is not necessary for me to die. She lives every day from now ononly by my grace, and thus yours.“I wish her no harm, and have no feelings one way or the other about her life.In fact, if anything, I wish it to be long. She has brought you a measure ofhappiness, and in return for that, I hope she will not have to forfeit her life.But then, you have some influence over that by your behavior.”Nicci cast a deliberate glare over Richard’s shoulder, to Cara. She then reachedout and with her fingers gently wiped blood from his mouth. She finishedcleaning his chin with her thumb. “Your MordSith has hurt you. I can help you ifyou wish.”“No.”“Very well.” She wiped her bloody fingers clean on the skirt of her black dress.“Unless you want to risk other people causing Kahlan’s death without yourintending it, I suggest you insure that others don’t act without your consent.Mord-Sith are resourceful and determined women. I respect their devotion toduty. However, if your Mord-Sith follows us-and my magic will tell me if shedoes-Kahlan will die.”“And just how will I know Kahlan is all right? We could get a mile away fromhere, and you could use that magic link to kill her. I would never know.”Nicci’s brow creased together. She looked genuinely puzzled.“Why would I do that?”A storm of rage and panic pushed his emotions first one way, and then the other.“Why are you doing any of this!”She regarded him in silent curiosity for a moment. “I have my reasons. I’msorry, Richard, that you must suffer in this. Making you suffer is not mypurpose. I give you my word that I will not harm Kahlan without informing you.”“You expect me to believe your word?”“I’ve told you the truth. I have no reason to lie to you. In time, you will cometo understand everything better. Kahlan will come to no harm from me as long asI am safe, and you come with me.”For reasons he couldn’t fathom, Richard found himself believing her. She seemeddead honest and completely sure of herself, as if she had reasoned it all out athousand times.He didn’t believe that Nicci was telling him everything. She was making itsimple so that he could grasp the important elements and have an easier timedeciding what to do. Whatever the rest of it was, it couldn’t be as devastatingas this much of it. The thought of being taken from Kahlan was agony, but hewould do almost anything to save her life. Nicci knew that.The enigma resurfaced. It was somehow linked to this.“The spell that protects a person’s mind from the dream walker works only forthose loyal to me. You can’t expect to be safe from Jagang if you do this. It’san act of treachery.”“Jagang does not frighten me. Don’t fear for my mind, Richard. I’m quite safefrom His Excellency. In time, perhaps you will come to see how wrong you havebeen in so many things.”“You’re deceiving yourself, Nicci.”“You only see part of it, Richard.” She lifted an eyebrow in a cryptic manner.“At heart, your cause is the cause of the Order. You are too noble a person forit to be otherwise.”“I may die at your hands, but I will die hating everything you and the Orderstand for.” Richard’s fists tightened. “You’ll not get what you want, Nicci.Whatever it is, you’ll not get it.”She regarded him with great compassion. “This is all for the best, Richard.”Nothing he said seemed to hold any sway with her, and he could make no sense ofthe things she said. The fury inside boiled up. The magic of the sword foughthim for control. He could barely contain it. “Do you really expect me to evercome to believe that?”Nicci’s blue eyes seemed to be focused somewhere beyond him.“Possibly not.”Her gaze fixed on him once more. She put two fingers between her lips as sheturned and whistled. In the distance, a horse whinnied and trotted out of thewoods.“I have another horse for you, waiting up on the other side of the pass.”Terror clawed at his bones. Kahlan’s fingers tightened on his arm. Cara’s handtouched his back. Memories of being captured before and all it meant, all thethings he had endured, made his pulse race and his breath come in rapid pulls.He felt trapped. Everything was slipping through his fingers and there didn’tseem to be anything he could do about it.He wanted more than anything to fight, but he couldn’t figure how. He wished itwere as simple as striking down his adversary. He reminded himself that reason,not wishing, was his only chance. He seized the calm center within, and used itto quell the rising storm of panic.Nicci stood tall, her shoulders square, her chin up. She looked like someonefacing an execution with courage. He realized then that she truly was preparedfor whichever way it was to go.“I have given you your choice, Richard. You have no other options. Choose.”“There is no choice to make. I’ll not allow Kahlan to die.”“Of course not.” Nicci’s posture eased almost imperceptibly. A small smile ofreassurance warmed her eyes. “She will be fine.”The horse slowed from its trot as it approached. When the handsome dappled marehalted beside her, Nicci took ahold of the reins near the bit. Its gray maneruffled in the cold breeze. The mare snorted and tossed her head, uneasy beforestrangers, and eager to be away.“But . . . but,” Richard stammered as Nicci stepped up into the stirrup. “But,what am I allowed to take?”Nicci swung her leg over the horse’s rump and settled into the saddle. Shesquirmed herself into position and adjusted her shoulders, setting them back.Her black dress and blond hair stood out in stark relief against the iron sky.“You may bring anything you like, as long as it isn’t a person.” She clicked hertongue, urging her horse around to face him. “I suggest you take clothes andsuch. Whatever you wish to have with you. Take all you can carry, if you want.”Her voice took on an edge. “Leave that sword of yours, though. You won’t beneeding it.” She leaned down, her expression for the first time turning cold andthreatening. “You are no longer the Seeker, or Lord Rahl, leader of the D’Haranempire, or for that matter, you are no longer the husband of the MotherConfessor. From now on, you are nobody but Richard.”Cara stepped out beside him, a thunderhead of dark fury. “I am Mord-Sith. If youthink I’m going to allow you to take Lord Rahl, you’re crazy. The MotherConfessor has already stated her wishes. My duty, above all else, is to killyou.”Nicci curled three fingers around the reins, her thumbs holding them tight. “Doas you must. You know the consequences.”Richard held out a restraining arm to prevent Cara from going up after Nicci anddragging her off the horse. “Take it easy,” he whispered. “Time is on our side.As long as we’re all still alive, we have the chance to think of something.”The strain of Cara’s weight against his arm eased. She reluctantly backed astep.“I have to get some things,” Richard said to Nicci, trying to buy that time.“Wait, at least, until I can get my pack together.”Nicci laid the reins over and stepped her horse back toward him. She rested herleft wrist across the saddle’s pommel.“I’m leaving.” With a long graceful finger of her other hand, she pointed. “Yousee that pass up there? You be with me by the time I’m at the top, and Kahlanwill live. If I cross over and you aren’t with me, Kahlan will die. You have myword.”It was all happening too fast. He needed to think of a way to stall. “Then whatgood will any of this have done you?”“It will have told me what means more to you.” She sat back up in her saddle.“When you think about it, that is quite a profound question. It is yet to beanswered. By the time I get to the top of the pass, I will have the answer.”Nicci rocked her hips in the saddle, urging the horse ahead into a walk. “Don’tforget-top of the pass. You have until then to say your good-byes, pack what youwish to take, and then catch up with me if you wish Kahlan to live. Or, if youchoose to stay, you have until then to say your good-byes before she dies.Understand, though, when making your choice, that the first will be as final asthe second.”Kahlan struggled to run toward the horse, but Richard clutched her around herwaist.“Where are you taking him?” she demanded.Nicci stopped her horse momentarily and gazed down at Kahlan with a look offrightening finality.”Why, into oblivion.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22As she watched Nicci turn her dappled mare toward the pass and the distant bluemountains beyond, Kahlan was still struggling to overcome her dizziness fromwhat the woman had done to her. Off near the distant trees, a doe and her nearlygrown fawn, two of the small herd of deer that frequented the meadow, stood atalert, their ears perked, watching Nicci, waiting to see if she might be athreat, Spooked by what they saw when Nicci turned their way, both deer flickedtheir tails straight up and bounded for the trees.Kahlan refused to allow herself to give in to the disorientation. But forRichard’s iron arms around her waist, she would have thrown herself at theSister of the Dark. Kahlan had desperately wanted to unleash her Confessor’spower. No one had ever deserved it more.Had her senses not still been floundering in a daze, she might have been able toinvoke her power through the Con Dar, the Blood Rage of an ancient ability shepossessed. Such rare magic would have bridged the relatively small distance,but, reeling from the lingering force of Nicci’s conjuring, the attempt had beenfutile. It was all Kahlan could do to keep her feet under her and her last mealin her stomach.It was frustrating, infuriating, and humiliating, but Nicci had surprised herand with magic as swift as Kahlan’s Confessor’s power had taken her before shecould react. Once Nicci’s talons clutched her, Kahlan had been powerless.She had grown up being trained not to be taken by surprise. Confessors werealways targets; she knew better. Any number of times in similar situations shehad prevailed. Lulled by months of tranquillity, Kahlan had lost her edge. Shevowed never to let it happen again . . , but that would do her no good now.She could still feel Nicci’s vital magic sizzling through her, as if her soulitself had been scorched in the heat of the ordeal. Her insides roiled as wavesof the onslaught had yet to settle down. The cold air rushing across the meadow,bending the brown grass, swept up to chill her burning face. The wind carried anunfamiliar scent into the valley, something that her jumbled senses perceived asvaguely portentous. The big pines behind the house bowed and twisted but stoodtall as the wind broke against them with a sound not unlike waves rushingagainst stone cliffs.Whatever sort of magic had been unleashed in her, Kahlan was convinced Nicci hadtold the truth about its consequence. Despite how much she hated the woman,because of the maternity spell Kahlan felt a connection to her, a connectionthat she could only interpret as . . . affection. It was a bewilderingsensation. While positively disturbing, it was also, in a way, a comfortingconnection to the woman beyond her vile magic and twisted purpose. There seemedto be something deep within Nicci worth loving.Regardless of Kahlan’s far-fetched feelings, her perception and reasoning toldher the truth of the matter: such impressions were illusion. If she got theopportunity, she would not again hesitate for an instant to kill Nicci.“Cara,” Richard said, glaring at Nicci’s back as she walked her horse across themeadow, “I don’t want you even thinking about trying to stop her.”“I’m not going to allow-”“I mean it. I mean it more than any order I’ve ever given you. If you everbrought Kahlan to harm in such a way . . . well, I trust you’d never do such anevil thing to me. Why don’t you go get dressed.”Cara growled a curse under her breath. Richard turned to Kahlan as the Mord Sithmarched off into the house. Kahlan only then really noticed that Cara was naked.She must have been interrupted in her bath. The magic Nicci used had foggedKahlan’s mind, blurring her memory of recent events.Kahlan did recall quite clearly, though, the feel of the Agiel. The shatteringtorture of the MordSith’s weapon had spiked through Nicci’s magic like a lancethrough straw. Even though Cara had used her Agiel on Nicci, Kahlan felt it asif it had been used directly against the side of her own neck.Kahlan gently touched Richard’s jaw in sympathy, then took hold of his upperarms instead when he gave her a look that suggested no need for sympathy. Hisbig hands closed on her waist. She stepped into his embrace and rested herforehead against his cheek.“This can’t be,” she whispered. “It just can’t.”“But it is.”“I’m so sorry.”“Sorry?”“That I let her take me by surprise.” Kahlan trembled with anger at herself. “Ishould have been alert. If I’d done as I should have, and killed her first, itwould never have come to this.”Richard ran a hand gently down the back of her head, holding her to hisshoulder.“Remember how you killed me in a sword fight the other day?” She nodded againsthim. “We all make mistakes, get caught off guard. Don’t blame yourself. No oneis perfect. It could even be that she cast a web of magic to dull your awarenessso she could slip up to you like . . . like some silent unseen mosquito.”Kahlan had never considered that. Caught off guard or not, though, it made herfurious with herself. If only she had not been paying attention to the stupidchipmunk. If only she had looked up sooner. If only she had acted withoutwaiting a split second to analyze the true nature of the threat to decide if itwarranted the unleashing of her devastating magic.Almost from birth, Kahlan had been instructed in the use of her power, with themandate of unleashing it only upon being certain of the need. Much like killing,a Confessor’s power was the destruction of who a person was. Afterward, theperson acted exclusively on behalf of the Confessor, and at the direction of theConfessor. It was as final as death.Kahlan looked up into Richard’s gray eyes. They looked all the more gray withthe gray sky behind him.“My life is a precious and sacred thing to me,” she said. “Yours is no less toyou. Don’t throw yours away to be a slave to mine. I couldn’t stand it.”“It’s not come to that yet. I’ll figure something out. But for now, I have to gowith her.”“We’ll follow, but stay well back.” He was already shaking his head. “But, shewon’t even be aware-”“No. For all we know, she could have others with her. They could be waiting tocatch you if you follow. I couldn’t bear the thought of knowing that at anymoment she could use magic or somehow find out you were following. If thathappened, you would die for nothing.”“You mean you think she could . . . hurt you to make you tell her I planned tofollow.”“Let’s not let our imaginations get the better of us.”“But I should be close, for when you make a move-for when you figure a way tostop her.”Richard cupped her face tenderly in his hands. He had a strange look in hiseyes, a look she didn’t like.“Listen to me. I don’t know what’s going on, but you mustn’t die just to freeme.”Tears of desperation stung her eyes. She blinked them away. She fought to keepher voice from becoming a wail.“Don’t go, Richard. I don’t care what it means for me, as long as you can befree. I would die happy if doing so would keep you from the enemy’s cruel hands.I can’t allow the Order to have you. I can’t allow you to endure the slowgrinding death of a slave in exchange for my life. I can’t allow them to-”She bit off the words of what she feared most; she couldn’t bear the thought ofhim being tortured. It made her even more dizzy and sick to think of him beingmaimed and mutilated, of him suffering all alone and forgotten in some distantstinking dungeon with no hope of help.But Nicci said they wouldn’t. Kahlan told herself that, for her own sanity, shehad to believe Nicci’s word.Kahlan realized Richard was smiling to himself, as if trying to commit to memoryevery detail of her face while at the same time running a thousand other thingsthrough his thoughts.“There’s no choice,” he whispered. “I must do this.”She clutched his shirt in her fist. “You’re doing just as Nicci wants-she knowsyou’ll want to save me. I can’t allow you to make that sacrifice!”Richard looked up briefly, gazing out at the trees and mountains behind theirhouse, taking it all in, like a condemned man savoring his last meal. His gaze,more earnest, settled once more on hers.“Don’t you see? I am making no sacrifice. I am making a fair trade. The realitythat you exist is my basis for joy and happiness.“I make no sacrifice,” he repeated, stressing each word. “To be a slave, even ifthat is what happens to me, and yet know you’re alive, is my choice over beingfree in a world in which you don’t exist. I can live with the first. I can’t,with the second. The first is painful, the second unbearable.”Kahlan beat a fist against his chest. “But you will be a slave or worse and Ican’t bear that!”“Kahlan, listen to me. I will always have freedom in my heart because Iunderstand what it is. Because I do, I can work toward it. I will find a way tobe free.“I cannot find a way to bring you back to life.“The spirits know that in the past I’ve been willing to forfeit my life for ajust cause and if my life would truly make a difference. In the past, I haveknowingly imperiled both our lives, been willing to sacrifice both our lives-butnot in return for nothing. Don’t you see? This would be a fool’s bargain. I’llnot do it.”Kahlan pulled her breaths in small gasps, trying to told back the tears as wellas her rising sense of panic. “You’re the Seeker. You must find a way tofreedom. Of course you will. You will, I know.” She forced a swallow past theconstriction in her throat as she tried to reassure Richard, or perhaps herself.“You’ll find a way. I know you will. You’ll find a way and you’ll come back. Youdid before. You will this time.”The shadows of Richard’s features seemed dark and severe, cast as they were in amask of resignation.“Kahlan, you must be prepared to go on.”“What do you mean?”“You must find joy in the fact that I, too, live. You must be prepared to go onwith that knowledge and nothing else.”“What do you mean, nothing else?”He had a terrible look in his eyes-some kind of sad, grim, tragic acceptance.She didn’t want to look into his eyes, but, standing there with her hand againsthis chest, feeling the warmth of him, the life within him, she couldn’t makeherself look away as he spoke.“I think it’s different this time.”Kahlan pulled her hair back when the wind dragged it over her eyes. “Different?”“There’s something very different about the feel of this. It doesn’t make sensein the way things in the past have made sense. There’s something deadly seriousabout Nicci. Something singular. She’s planned this out and she’s prepared todie for it. I can’t lie to you to deceive you. Something tells me that, thistime, I may never be able to find a way to come back.”“Don’t say that.” In weak fingers trembling with dread, Kahlan gathered his darkshirt into a wrinkled knot. “Please don’t say that, Richard. You must try. Youmust find a way to come back to me.”“Don’t ever think I won’t be doing my best.” His voice was impassioned, almostto the point of sounding angry. “I swear to you, Kahlan, that as long as thereis a breath in my lungs, I’ll never give up; I’ll always try to find a way. Butwe can’t ignore the possibility just because it’s painful to contemplate: I maynever be back.“You must face the fact that it looks like you must go on without me, but withthe knowledge that I’m alive, just as I will have that awareness of you in myheart where no one can touch it. In our hearts, we have each other and alwayswill. That was the oath we swore when we were married-to love and honor eachother for all time. This can’t change it. Distance can’t change it. Time can’tchange it.”“Richard . . .” She choked back her wail, but she couldn’t keep the tears fromcoursing down her face. “I can’t stand the thought of you being a slave becauseof me. Don’t you see that? Don’t you see what that would do to me? I’ll killmyself if I must so that she can’t do this to you. I must.”He shook his head, the wind ruffling his hair. “Then I would have no reason toescape her. Nothing to escape for.”“You won’t need to escape, that’s just it she won’t be able to hold you.”“She’s a Sister of the Dark.” He threw open his hands. “She will simply useanother means I won’t know how to counter-and if you’re dead, I won’t care to.”“But-”“Don’t you see?” He seized her by her shoulders. “Kahlan, you must live to giveme a reason to try to escape her.”“Your own life is your reason,” she said. “To be free to help people will beyour reason.”“The people be cursed.” He released her and gestured angrily. “Even people whereI grew up turned against us. They tried to murder us. Remember? The lands thathave surrendered into the union with D’Hara will likely not remain loyal,either, when they see the reality of the Imperial Order’s army moving up intothe Midlands. Eventually, D’Hara will stand alone.“People don’t understand or value freedom. The way it now stands, they won’tfight for it. They’ve proven it in Anderith, and in Hartland, where I grew up.What more clear evidence could be seen? I hold out no false hope. Most of therest of the Midlands will quail when it comes time to fight against the ImperialOrder. When they see the size of the Order’s army and their brutality with thosewho resist, they will surrender their freedom.”He looked away from her, as if regretting his flash of anger in their lastmoments together. His tall form, so stalwart against the sweep of mountains andsky, sagged a little, seeming to huddle closer to her as if seeking comfort.“The only thing I have to hope for is to get away so I can come back to you.”His voice had lost all traces of heat as he spoke in a near whisper. “Kahlan,please don’t take that hope from me-it’s all I have.”In the distance she could see the fox trotting across the meadow. Its thick,whitetipped tail followed out straight behind as the fox made its inspection forany rodents that might be about. As Kahlan’s gaze tracked its movement, from thecorner of her eye she caught a glimpse of Spirit standing proud and free in thewindow. How could she lose the man who had carved that for her when she neededit most?She could, she knew, because now he needed what only she could give him. Lookingback up into his intense gray eyes, she realized she could not hope to deny himhis earnest plea and only request, not at a time like this.“All right, Richard. I won’t do anything rash to free you. I’ll wait for you.I’ll endure it.“I know you. I know you won’t ever give up. You know I expect no less from you.When you get away-and you will-I’ll be waiting for you, and then we’ll betogether again. We’ll never be apart in our hearts. As you said, our oath oflove is timeless.”Richard closed his eyes with relief. He tenderly kissed her brow. He lifted herhand from his chest and pressed soft kisses to her knuckles. She saw then howmuch her pledge meant to him.Kahlan pulled her hand back and quickly removed her necklace, the one Shota hadgiven her as a wedding gift. It was meant to prevent her from getting pregnant.She turned Richard’s hand over and pushed the necklace into his palm. He frownedin confusion at the small, dark stone hanging from the gold chain draped overhis fingers.“What’s this about?”“I want you to take it.” Kahlan cleared her throat to keep her voice. She couldonly manage a whisper. “I know what she wants of you-what she will make you do.”“No, that’s not what . . .” He shook his head. He said, “I’m not taking this,”as if turning it away would somehow deny the possibility.Kahlan put her hand to the side of his face. His face wavered before her in awatery blur.“Please, Richard. Please take it. For me. I couldn’t bear the thought of anotherwoman having your child.” Or even the thought of the attempt at its creation-butshe didn’t say that part of it. “Especially not after mine . . . “He looked away from her eyes. “Kahlan . . .” Words failed him.“Just do it for me. Take it. Please, Richard. I’m doing as you ask and willendure your captivity; please honor my request in return. I couldn’t stand thethought of that bewitching blond beast having your child-the child that shouldbe mine. Don”you see? How could I ever love something I hated? And how could Iever hate something that was part of you? Please, Richard, don’t let it come tothat.”The cold wind lifted and twisted her hair. Her whole life, it seemed, wastwisting out of her control. She could hardly believe that this place of suchjoy, peace, and redemption, a place where she had come to live again, could be aplace where it would all be taken away.Richard held the necklace out to her, as if it were a thing that might bite him.The dark stone swung under his fingers, gleaming in the gloom.“Kahlan, I don’t think that’s what this is about. I really don’t. But anyway,she could simply refuse to wear it and threaten your life if I didn’t . . .”Kahlan pulled the gold chain from his fingers and laid it all in a small neatmound in his palm. The dark stone glimmered from its imprisonment behind theveil of tiny gold links. She closed his fingers around the necklace and held hisfist shut with both of her hands.“You’re the one who demands we not ignore those things that are painful tocontemplate.”“But if she refuses . . .”Kahlan gripped his fist tighter in her trembling fingers. “If it comes to a timewhen she makes that demand of you, you must convince her to wear the necklace.You must. For me. It’s bad enough for me to think she might take my love, myhusband, from me like that, but to also fear . . .”His big hand felt so warm and familiar and comforting to her. Her words camechoked with desperate tears. She could do no more than beg. “Please, Richard.”He pressed his lips tight, then nodded and stuffed the necklace in a pocket. “Idon’t believe those are her intentions, but if it should turn out to be so, youhave my word: she will wear the necklace.”Kahlan sagged against him with a sob.He took her by the arm. “Come on. Hurry. I have to get whatever I need to take.I’ve only got a few minutes, or all this will be for nothing. I can take theshorter trail and still catch up with her at the top of the pass, but I don’thave much time.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23Kahlan was aware of Cara, wearing her bloodred leather, standing in the doorwayto their bedroom watching Richard cram his things into his pack. Kahlan noddedas she and Richard exchanged brief, stilted instructions. They had already cometo terms with the life-and-death issues. It seemed they both feared to sayanything of consequence for fear of disturbing the delicate, desperate,difficult agreements they had reached.The meager light coming in the small window did little to brighten the gloom.Cara, over in the doorway, blocked some of the light. The room had the feel of adungeon. Richard, dressed in dark clothes, looked like a shadow. So many times,as she lay in bed recovering, Kahlan had thought of it that way-as her dungeon.Now it had the palpable sense of a dungeon, but with the clean aroma of pinewalls instead of the stench of a stone cell from where trembling, sweatingprisoners were taken to their death.Cara looked forlorn one moment and the next like lightning seeking ground.Kahlan knew that the Mord-Sith’s emotions had to be as torn as her own,balancing on a knife’s edge with despair and grief on one side and rage on theother. MordSith were not used to being in such a position, but then, Cara wasnow more than simply Mord-Sith.Kahlan watched Richard pack the black trousers, black undershirt, black and goldtunic, silver wristbands, over-belt with its pouches, and golden cloak into hispack, where they took up a good portion of the available space. He was wearinghis dark forest garb; he didn’t have time to change. Kahlan hoped a time wouldsoon come when he would escape and again wear the clothes of a war wizard totoad them against the Order. They all needed him to lead the D’Haran Empireagainst the invading horde from the Old World.For reasons that weren’t always entirely clear, Richard had become the linchpinof their struggle. Kahlan knew his feelings about that-that people must bewilling to fight for themselves and not only for him-were valid. If an idea wassound, it had to have a life beyond a leader, or the leader had failed.As he threw other clothes and small items into his pack, Richard told Kahlanthat maybe she could find Zedd, that he might have some ideas. She nodded andsaid she would, knowing Zedd wouldn’t be able to do anything. This terribletriangle was not liable to be susceptible to influence by outsidersNicci hadseen to that. It was just a hope Richard was giving her, the only bouquet hecould offer in the desolate void of reality.Kahlan didn’t know what to do with her hands. She stood twining her fingerstogether as tears dripped off her chin. There must be something to say,something important, some last words while she had the chance, but she couldn’tthink of them.She supposed he knew what she felt, what was in her heart, and words couldn’tadd anything to that. She pressed her fist against the aching knot of anxiety inthe pit of her stomach.A sense of doom crowded in the room like a fourth person, a grim guard waitingto take Richard away. This was the heart of terror, being controlled by what youcouldn’t see, couldn’t reason with, couldn’t persuade or battle. The doomwaited, implacable, immune, indifferent.As Cara vanished from the doorway, Richard pulled a fistful of gold and silverfrom an inside pocket in his leather pack. He hastily dropped roughly half backin the pack and then held out the rest.“Take this. You might need it.”“I’m the Mother Confessor. I don’t need gold.”He tossed it on the bed for her anyway, apparently not wanting to argue with herin their last moments together.“Do you want any of the carvings?” she asked. It was a stupid question and sheknew it, but she had to fill the awful silence and it was the only thing to comeinto her head, other than a hopeless plea.“No. I’ve no need for them. When you look at them, think of me, and remember Ilove you.” He rolled a blanket tight, wrapped it with a small patch of oiledcanvas, and tied it with leather thongs to the bottom of his pack. “I guess if Iwere to want any, I could always carve some.”Kahlan handed him a cake of soap.“I don’t need your carving to remind me of your love. I’ll remember. Carvesomething to make Nicci see that you should be free.”Richard glanced up with a grim smile. “I plan on seeing to it that she knows Iwon’t ever give in to her and the Order. Carvings won’t be necessary. She thinksshe has this all planned out, but she’s going to find out I’m bad company.”Richard jammed a fist in his pack, making more room. “Very bad company.”Cara rushed back in, carrying small bundles with the corners tied in knots atthe top. She plopped them down one at a time onto the bed.“I put together some food for you, Lord Rahl. Things that will keep fortraveling--dried meat and fish and such. Some rice and beans. I . . . I put aloaf of bread that I made on top, so eat it first, while it’s still good.”He thanked her as he put the small bundles into his pack. He put the bread tohis nose for a deep whiff before packing it away. He gave Cara a smile ofappreciation.Richard straightened. His smile evaporated in a way that for some reason madeKahlan’s blood go cold. Looking like he was in the throes of committing himselfto some last, grim deed, Richard pulled the baldric off over his head. He heldthe goldand-silver wrought scabbard in his left hand and drew the Sword of Truthin his white-knuckled right fist.The blade rang out with its unique metallic sound, announcing its freedom.Richard drew his sleeve up his arm and wiped the sword across his forearm.Kahlan winced as she watched. She didn’t know if he cut deeply accidentally, oron purpose. With an icy sensation she recalled that Richard cut very preciselywith any sharp steel edge.He turned the blade and wiped both sides in gouts of vivid red blood. He bathedthe blade in it, giving it a voluptuous taste, wetting its appetite for more.Kahlan didn’t know what he was doing or why he was doing it now, but it was afrightening ritual to witness. She wished he had drawn it before and cut downNicci. Her blood, Kahlan would not fear seeing.Richard picked up the scabbard and slammed the Sword of Truth home. Bloodrunning over his hand left greasy red smears across the scabbard as he slid hishand down the length of it, to the tip, and then seized the sheathed weapon atits center point in his fist. His head bowed, his eyes on the dull silver andgold reflections lustrous even through his own blood, he loomed closer to her.Richard looked up, and Kahlan saw the lethal rage of magic dancing in his eyes.He had invoked the sword’s terrible wrath, called it forth, and then put itaway. She’d never seen him do such a thing before.He lifted the sword in its scabbard to her. The tendons in the back of his fiststood out in the strain. The white of his knuckles showed through the blood.“Take it,” he said in a hoarse voice that betrayed the struggle within.Spellbound, Kahlan lifted the scabbard in her palms. For that instant, until hepulled away his bloody hand, she felt a jolting shock as if she were suddenlywelded to the weapon by hot fury unlike anything she had ever experienced. Shehalf expected to see a burst of sparks. She could feel such rage emanating fromthe cold steel that it nearly dropped her to her knees. She might have droppedthe weapon itself in that first instant, had she been able to let go of it. Shecould not.Once Richard removed his hand, the sheathed sword lost the passionate rage andfelt no different from any other weapon.Richard lifted a finger in caution. The dangerous magic still glazed his eyes.The muscles of his jaw tightened until she could see it standing out all the wayup through his temples.“Don’t draw this sword,” he warned in that awful hoarse whisper, “unless it’s amatter of your life. You know the ghastly things this weapon can do to a person.Not only the one under the power of the blade, but the one under the power ofthe hilt.”Kahlan, arrested by the intensity of his gaze, could only nod. She clearlyrecalled the first time Richard had used the sword to kill a man. The first timehe came to learn the horror of killing had been to protect her.Using the weapon that first time, unleashing the magic the first time, hadnearly killed Richard as well. It had been a struggle for him to learn how tocontrol such a storm of magic as the Sword of Truth freed.Without the rage of the sword’s magic, Richard’s eyes were capable of conveyingmenace. Kahlan could recall several times when his raptor’s glare, by itself,had brought a roomful of people to silence. There were few things worse than theneed to escape the look in those eyes. Now, those eyes hungered to deliverdeath.“Be angry if you must use this,” he growled. “Be very angry. That will be youronly salvation.”Kahlan swallowed. “I understand.” She nodded. “I remember.”Righteous rage was the only defense against the crippling pain the sword exactedas payment for its service.“Life or death. No other reason. I don’t know what will happen, and I’d just assoon you not find out. But I’d prefer that, to you being without this terribledefense if you need it. I’ve given it a taste of blood, it will come outvoracious. When it comes out, it will be in a blood rage.”“I understand.”His eyes cooled at last. “I’m sorry to give you the terrible responsibility ofthis weapon, especially in this way, but it’s the only protection I can offer.”With a hand on his arm to gently reassure him, Kahlan said, “I won’t have to useit.”“Dear spirits, I hope not.” He glanced over his shoulder, taking a last look attheir room, and then at Cara. “I have to get going.”She ignored his words. “Give me your arm, first.”He saw she had bandages left over from when Kahlan was still recovering. Withoutobjection, he held out his blood-soaked arm. Cara used a wet cloth to quicklyswab his arm before she wound it in clean bandages.Richard thanked her as she was finishing. Cara split the end, put the tailsaround his wrists, and tied a quick knot. “We will come part of the way withyou.”“No. You will stay here.” Richard pulled down his sleeve. “I don’t want to riskit.”“But-”“Cara, I want you to protect Kahlan. I’m leaving her in your hands. I know youwon’t let me down.”Cara’s big beautiful blue eyes, glistening with tears, reflected the kind ofpain Kahlan was sure Cara never allowed anyone to see.“I swear to protect her as I would protect you, Lord Rahl, if you swear to getaway and return.”Richard flashed her a brief smile, trying to ease her misery. “I’m Lord Rahl-Idon’t need to remind you that I’ve wiggled out of tighter spots than this.” Hekissed her cheek. “Cara, I swear I’ll never give up trying to get away-you havemy word.”Kahlan realized he hadn’t really sworn to Cara’s words. He wouldn’t, she knew,want to make a promise he might not be able to keep.Bending to the bed, he pulled his pack close. “I have to go.” He held the strapin a stranglehold. “I can’t be late.”Kahlan’s fingers tightened on his arm, Cara laid a hand on his shoulder. Richardturned back and gripped Kahlan’s shoulders.“Listen to me, now. I wish you would stay here, in this house in these mountainswhere it’s safe for you, but I don’t think anything short of my dying requestcould convince you to do that. At least stay for four or five days, in case I’mable to figure out what’s going on and can escape Nicci. She may be a Sister ofthe Dark, but I’m no longer exactly a stranger to magic. I’ve escaped powerfulpeople before. I’ve sent Darken Rahl back to the underworld. I’ve gone to theTemple of the Winds in another world in order to stop the plague. I’ve escapedworse than this. Who knows-this might be simpler than it seems. If I do escapeher, I’ll come back here, so wait for a while, at least.“If I can’t get away from Nicci for now, try to find Zedd. He might have someidea of what to do. Ann was with him the last time we saw him. She’s the Prelateof the Sisters of the Light and knew Nicci for a very long time. Perhaps sheknows something that, along with what Zedd might be able to come up with, couldhelp.”“Richard, don’t worry about me. Just take care of yourself. I’ll be waiting foryou when you get away, so just be at ease about that much of it and put all youreffort into escaping from her. We’ll wait here for a while-I promise.”“I will watch over her, Lord Rahl. Don’t worry about the Mother Confessor.”Richard nodded. He turned back to Kahlan. His fingers on her arms tightened. Hisbrow drew down.“I know you and I know the way you feel, but you have to listen to me. The timehas not yet come. It may never come. You may think I’m wrong in this, but if youclose your eyes to the reality of what is, in favor of what you would wish justbecause you’re the Mother Confessor and feel responsible for the people of theMidlands, then there is no reason for us to bother hoping we’ll be togetheragain because we won’t. We will be dead, and the cause of freedom will be dead.”His face loomed closer. “Above all else, our forces must not attack the heart ofthe Order’s army. It’s too soon. If they-if you-carry an assault directly intothe heart of the Order thinking you can win, it will be the end of our forces,and the end of our chances. All hope for the cause of freedom, and all hope todefeat the Order, will be lost for generations to come.“It’s the same way we must use our heads with Nicci, and not fight her in adirect attack, or we will both die. You promised you would not kill yourself tofree me. Don’t throw that promise away by going against what I’m telling younow.”It all seemed so unimportant at the moment. The only thing that mattered wasthat she was losing him. She would have cast the rest of the world to the wolvesif she could just keep him.“All right, Richard.”“Promise me.” His fingers were hurting her arms. He shook her. “I mean it. Youcould throw it all away if you don’t heed my warning. You could destroy the hopeof people for the next fifty generations. You could be the one who destroysfreedom and brings a dark age upon the world. Promise me you won’t.”A thousand thoughts swirled in chaotic turmoil through her mind. Kahlan staredup into his eyes. She heard herself say, “I promise, Richard. Until you say so,we’ll make no direct attack.”He looked like a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. A smile spreadon his face as he pulled her into an embrace. His fingers combed into her hairand cradled her head as she rose to his kiss. Her hands slipped up the backs ofhis shoulders as she held him. It only lasted a moment, but in that moment ofstolen bliss, they shared a world of emotions.All too soon the kiss, the embrace, was over. His warm presence swirled awayfrom her, allowing the awful weight of doom to settle firmly down atop her.Richard briefly hugged Cara before he hefted his pack onto a shoulder. He turnedback at the bedroom doorway.“I love you, Kahlan. Never anyone before you, nor ever after. Only you.” Hiseyes said it even better.“You’re everything to me, Richard. You know that.”“I love you, too, Cara.” He winked at her. “Take good care of the both of youuntil I’m back.”“I will, Lord Rahl. You have my word as Mord-Sith.”He gave her a crooked smile. “I have your word as Cara.”And then he was gone.“I love you, too, Lord Rahl,” Cara whispered to the empty doorway.Kahlan and Cara ran into the main room and stood in the doorway watching himrunning across the meadow.Cara cupped her hands around her mouth. “I love you too, Lord Rahl,” sheshouted.Richard turned as he ran and acknowledged her words with a wave.Together, they watched Richard’s dark figure flying through the dead browngrass, his fluid gait swiftly carrying him away. Just before he disappeared intothe trees, he stopped and turned. Kahlan shared a last look with him, a lookthat said everything. He turned and vanished into the woods, his clothes makinghim impossible to distinguish from the trees and undergrowth.Kahlan collapsed to her knees, sitting back on her heels as she lost control ofher emotions. She wept helplessly, her head in her hands, at what seemed the endof the world.Cara squatted beside her to put an arm around her shoulders. Kahlan hated tohave Cara see her cry that way, cry in such weakness. She felt a distantgratitude when Cara held her head to her shoulder and didn’t say anything.Kahlan didn’t know how long she sat on the dirt floor in her white Confessor’sdress, sobbing, but after a time, she was able to make herself stop. Her heartcontinued to spiral down into hopeless gloom. Each passing moment seemedunendurable. The bleak future stretched out before her, a wasteland of agony.She finally looked up and gazed about at the house. Without Richard it wasempty. He had given it life. Now it was a dead place.“What do you wish to do, Mother Confessor?”It was getting dark. Whether it was the sunset, or the clouds getting thicker,Kahlan didn’t know. She wiped at her eyes.“Let’s begin to get our things together. We’ll stay here a few days, likeRichard asked. After that, anything the horses can’t carry that will spoil, we’dbetter bury. We should board up the windows. We’ll close up the house good andtight.”“For when we return to paradise, someday?”Kahlan nodded as she looked about, trying desperately to focus her mind on atask and not on that which would crush her. The worst part, she knew, was goingto be night. When she was alone in bed. When he wasn’t with her.Now, the valley seemed more like paradise lost. She had trouble believing thatRichard was really gone. It seemed as if he were just off to catch some fish, orhunt berries, or scout the hills. It seemed as if, surely, he would be comingback soon.“Yes, for when we return. Then it will be paradise again. I guess when Richardreturns, wherever we are will be paradise.”Kahlan noticed that Cara didn’t hear her answer. The Mord-Sith was staring outthrough the doorway.“Cara, what is it?”“Lord Rahl is gone.”Kahlan rested a comforting hand on Cara’s shoulder. “I know it hurts, but wemust put our minds to-”“No.” Cara turned back. Her blue eyes were strangely troubled. “No, that’s notwhat I mean. I mean that I can’t sense him. I can’t feel the bond to Lord Rahl.I know where he is-he’s going up the trail up to that pass-but I can’t feel it.”She looked panicked. “Dear spirits, it’s like going blind. I don’t know how tofind him. I can’t find Lord Rahl.”Kahlan’s first flash of fear was that he fell and was killed, or that Nicci hadexecuted him. She used reason to force the fear aside.“Nicci knows about the bond. She probably used her magic to cloak it, or tosever it.”“Cloaked it, somehow.” Cara rolled her Agiel in her fingers. “That’s what it hasto be. I can still feel my Agiel, so I know that Lord Rahl has to be alive. Thebond is still there . . . but I cannot feel it to sense where he is.”Kahlan sighed with relief. “That has to be it, then. Nicci doesn’t want to befollowed, so she cloaked his bond with magic.”Kahlan realized that to be protected from the dream walker by the bond toRichard, people would now have to believe in him without the reassurance offeeling the bond. Their link would have to remain true in their hearts if theywere to survive.Could they do that? Could they believe in that way?Cara stared out the doorway, across the meadow to the mountains where Richardhad disappeared. The blue-violet sky behind the blue-gray mountains was slashedwith blazing orange gashes. The snowcaps were lower than they had been. Winterwas racing toward them. If Richard didn’t soon escape and return, Kahlan andCara would have to be gone before it arrived.Bouts of dizzying grief threatened to drown her in a flood of tears. Needing todo something, she went to her room to take off her Confessor’s dress. She wouldset to work with the task of closing up the house and preparing to leave.As Kahlan pulled her dress off, Cara appeared in the doorway.“Where are we going to go, Mother Confessor? You said we were going to leave,but you never said where we were going to go.”Kahlan saw Spirit standing in the window, fists at her sides as she looked outat the world. She lifted the carving off the sill and trailed her fingers overthe flowing form.Seeing the statue, touching it, feeling the power of it, made Kahlan want toreach deep inside for resolve. Once before, she had been hopeless, and Richardcarved this for her. Her other hand fell to her side, and her fingers foundRichard’s sword lying across their bed. Kahlan focused her mind, ordering theturbulent swirl of despair thickening into wrath.“To destroy the Order.”“Destroy the Order?”“Those beasts took my unborn child, and now they’ve taken Richard. I will makethem regret it a thousand times over and then another thousand. I once swore anoath of death without mercy to the Order. The time has come. If killing everylast one of them is the only way to get Richard back, then that’s what I willdo.”“You swore an oath to Lord Rahl.”“Richard said nothing about not killing them, just about how. My oath was not totry to drive a sword through their heart. He said nothing about bleeding them todeath with a thousand cuts. I won’t break my oath, but I intend to kill everylast one of them.”“Mother Confessor, you must not do that.”“Why?”Cara’s blue eyes gleamed with menace. “You must leave half for me.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24Richard had stopped to turn back and look at her only once as he ran, justbefore he went into the trees. She was standing in the doorway in her whiteConfessor’s dress, her long thick hair tumbling down, her form the embodiment offeminine grace, looking as beautiful as the first time he saw her. They heldeach other’s gaze for a brief moment. He was too far away to see the green ofher eyes, a color he’d never beheld on anyone else, a color of suchheart-piercing perfection that it sometimes would stop his breathing, and atother times quicken it.But it was the mind of the woman behind those eyes that in reality captivatedhim. Richard had never met her equal.He knew he was cutting the time close. As much as he hated the idea of turninghis gaze away from Kahlan, her life hung in the balance. His purpose was clear.Richard had plunged into the woods.He had traveled the trail often enough; he knew where he could run, and where hehad to be careful. Now, with little time left, he couldn’t afford to be toocareful. He didn’t try for a glimpse of the house.He was alone in the woods as he ran, his thoughts but salt in a raw wound. Foronce he felt out of place in the woods-powerless, insignificant, hopeless. Barebranches clattered together in the wind, while others creaked and moaned, as ifin mock sorrow to see him leaving. He tried not to think as he ran.Fir and spruce trees took over as the ground rose out of the valley. His breathcame in rapid pulls. In the cold shadows of the forest floor, the wind was adistant pursuer far overhead, chasing after him, shooing him along, hounding himaway from the happiest place he had ever been. Spongy mounds of verdant moss laydotting the forest floor in the low places where mostly cedars grew, lookinglike wedding cakes done up in an intense green, sprinkled over with tiny,chocolate brown, scale-like cedar needles.Richard tiptoed on rocks sticking up above the water as he crossed a smallstream. As the little brook tumbled down the slope, it went under rocks andboulders in places, making an echoing drumming sound, announcing him to thestalwart oaks along his march into imprisonment. In the flat gray light, hefailed to see a reddish loop of cedar root. It caught his foot and sent himsprawling facedown in the trail, a final humiliation on his judgment andsentence of banishment.As Richard lay in the cold, damp, discarded leaves, dead branches, and otherrefuse of the forest, he considered not getting up ever again. He could just liethere and let it all end, let the indifferent wind freeze his limbs stiff, letthe sneaky spiders and snakes and wolves come to bite him and bleed him todeath, and then finally the uncaring trees would cover him over, never to bemissed except by a few, his vanishing a good riddance to most.A messenger with a message no one wanted to heed.A leader come too soon.Why not just let it end, let silent death take them both to their peace and bedone with it?The scornful trees all watched to see what this unworthy man might do, to see ifhe had the courage to get to his feet and face what was ahead. He didn’t knowhimself if he did.Death was easier, and in that bottomless moment, less painful to consider.Even Kahlan, as much as he loved her, wanted something from him he could notgive her: a lie. She wanted him to tell her that something he knew to be so, wasnot. He would do anything for her, but he couldn’t change what was. At least shehad enough faith in him to let him lead her away from the shadows of tyrannydarkening the world. Even if she didn’t believe him, she was probably the onlyone willing, of her own free will, to follow him.In truth, he lay on the ground for only seconds, regaining his senses from thefall and catching his breath as the thoughts flooded through his mind-briefseconds in which he allowed himself to be weak, in exchange for how hard he kneweverything to come would be.Weakness, to balance the strength he would need. Doubt, to balance his certaintyof purpose. Fear, to balance the courage he would have to call upon.Even as he wondered if he could get up, he knew he would. His convulsion ofself-pity ended abruptly. He would do anything for her. Even this. A thousandtimes over, even this.With renewed resolve, Richard forced his mind away from the dominion of darkthoughts. It wasn’t so hopeless; he knew better. After all, he had faced trialsmuch more difficult than this one Sister of the Dark. He had once gotten Kahlanout of the clutches of five Sisters of the Dark. This was but one. He woulddefeat her, too. Anger welled up at the thought of Nicci thinking she could makethem dance at the end of her selfish strings.Despair extinguished, rage flooded in.And then he was running again, dodging trees as he cut corners off the trail. Hehurdled fallen trees and leaped over gaps in the rock shelves, rather thantaking the safe route down and up. Each shortcut or leap saved him a fewprecious seconds.A broken tree limb snagged his pack, yanking it from his shoulder. He tried tohang on to it as he flew past, but it slipped from his grasp and spilled acrossthe ground.Richard exploded in fury, as if the tree had done it on purpose just to taunthim in his rush. He kicked the offending branch, snapping it out of its drysocket. He fell to his knees and scooped his things back into the pack, clawingup moss along with gold and silver coins, and a pine seedling along with thesoap Kahlan had given him. He didn’t have time to care as he shoved it all backin. This time, he put the pack onto his back, rather than letting it hang fromone shoulder. He had been trying to save time before, and it had cost himinstead.The path, which in places was no more than sections of animal trails, began torise sharply, occasionally requiring that he use both hands to hold on to rocksor roots as he climbed. He’d been up it enough times to know the soundhandholds. As cold as the day was, Richard had to wipe sweat from his eyes. Heskinned his knuckles on rough granite as he jammed his fingers into cracks forhandholds.In his mind’s eye, Nicci was riding too swiftly, covering too much ground,getting too far ahead. He knew it had been foolhardy to take so much time beforeleaving, thinking he could make up for it on the trail. He wished he could havetaken more time, though, to hold Kahlan.His insides were in agony at the thought of how heartbroken Kahlan was. He felt,somehow, that it was worse for her. Even if she was free, and he was not, thatmade it worse for her because, in her freedom, she had to restrain herself whenshe wanted nothing more than to come after him. In bondage to a master, Richardhad it easy; he had only to follow orders.He burst out of the trees onto the wider trail at the top of the pass. Nicci wasnowhere to be seen. He held his breath as he looked to the east, fearing to spother going down the back side of the pass. Beyond the high place where he stood,he could see forests spread out before him with mountains to each side liftingthe carpet of trees. In the distance, greater mountains yet soared to dizzyingheights, their peaks and much of their slopes stark white against the gloom ofheavy gray sky.Richard didn’t see any horse and rider, but since the trail twisted down intothe trees not far beyond where he stood, that didn’t really prove anything. Thetop of the pass was a bald bit of open ledge, with most of the rest of the horsetrail winding through deep woods. He quickly inspected the ground, casting aboutfor tracks, hoping she wouldn’t be too far ahead of him and he could catch herbefore she did something terrible. His sense of doom eased when he found notracks.He peered out at the valley far below, across the straw-brown meadow, to theirhouse. It was too far away to see anyone. He hoped Kahlan would stay there for afew days, as he had asked. He didn’t want her going to the army, going to fighta losing war, endangering her life for nothing.Richard understood Kahlan’s desire to be with her people and to defend herhomeland. She believed she could make a difference. She could not. Not yet.Maybe not ever. Richard’s vision was really nothing more than the acceptance ofthat reality. Shaking your sword at the sky didn’t keep the sun from setting.Richard cast an appraising squint at the clouds. For the last two days, he hadthought that the signs pointed to the first snow of the season soon rolling downonto their valley home. By the look of the sky and the scent in the wind, hejudged he was right.He knew he wasn’t going to be able to escape Nicci so easily as to be able toget back to Kahlan within a few days. He had invented that story for anotherreason. Once the weather shitted and the snow arrived up in these mountainhighlands, it tended to come in an onslaught. If the storm was as big as heestimated by the signs it could be, Kahlan and Cara would end up being stuck intheir house until spring. With all the food they’d put up, as well as thesupplies he’d brought in, they had plenty to last the two of them. The firewoodhe’d cut would keep them warm.There, she would be safe. With the army, she would be in constant danger.The dappled mare walked out of the trees, coming around a bend not far away.Nicci’s blue eyes were on Richard from the first instant she appeared.At the time the Sisters of the Light had taken him to the Palace of the Prophetsin the Old World, Richard had mistakenly believed Kahlan wanted him taken away.He didn’t know or understand she had sent him away to save his life. Richardthought she didn’t ever want to see him again.While in captivity at the palace, Richard thought Nicci was the personificationof lust. He was hardly able to find his voice when around her. He had hardlybeen able to believe a creature of such physical perfection existed, other thanin daydreams.Now, as he watched her swaying gently in her saddle as she walked her horse upthe trail, her intense blue eyes locked on his, it seemed to him she wore herbeauty with a kind of grim acceptance. She had so completely lost her stunningpresence that he couldn’t even envision any reason for his onetime sentimentabout her.Richard had since learned the true depths of what a real woman was, what reallove was, and what real fulfillment was. In that light, Nicci paled intoinsignificance.As he watched her coming closer, he was surprised to realize she looked sad. Sheseemed almost to be sorry to find him there, but more than that, there seemed tobe a shadow of relief passing across her countenance.“Richard, you lived up to my faith.” Her voice suggested that it had beentenuous as best. “You’re in a sweat; would you like to rest?”Her feigned kindness drove hot blood all the way up to his scalp. He pulled hisglare from her gentle smile and turned to the trail, walking ahead of her horse.He thought it best if he not say anything until he could get a grip on his rage.Not far down the trail they came to a black stallion with a white blaze on itsface. The big horse was picketed in a small grassy patch of open ground amongtowering pines.“Your horse, as I promised,” she said. “I hope you find him to your liking. Ijudged him to be big and strong enough to carry you comfortably.”Richard checked and found the smooth snaffle bit to his approval; she wasn’tabusing the animals with cruel bits used to dominate, as he knew some of theSisters did. The rest of the tack appeared sound. The horse looked healthy.Richard took a few moments to introduce himself to the stallion. He remindedhimself that the horse was not the cause of his problems, and he shouldn’t lethis attitude toward Nicci affect how he treated this handsome animal. He didn’task the horse’s name. He let it sniff his hand beneath its curled muzzle, thenstroked the stallion’s sleek black neck. He patted its shoulder, conveying agentle introduction without words. The powerful black stallion stamped his fronthooves. He was not yet all that pleased to meet Richard.For the time being, there was no choice of routes; there was only the one trailand it ran from the direction of the house where Kahlan was back to the east.Richard took the lead so that he wouldn’t have to look at Nicci.He didn’t want to jump right on the stallion at first sight and make a badimpression that would take a lot of work to overcome. Better to let the horseget to know him, first, if just for a mile or so. He held the reins slack underthe stallion’s jaw and walked in front of him, letting him get comfortable withfollowing this strange new man. Putting his mind to the task of working with thehorse helped divert him from thoughts that threatened to drag him under a sea ofsorrow. After a time, the stallion seemed at ease with his new master andRichard mounted without any ado.The narrow trail precluded Nicci walking her horse beside his. Her dappled maresnorted its displeasure at having to follow the stallion. Richard was pleased toknow that he had already upset the order of things.Nicci offered no conversation, sensing, he supposed, his mood. He was going withher, but there was no way she could hope to make him happy about it.When it started getting dark, Richard simply dismounted beside a small brookwhere the horses could have a drink, and tossed his things on the ground. Nicciwordlessly accepted his choice of campsite, and unstrapped her bedroll from hersaddle after she’d taken it down off her horse. She sat on her bedroll, lookinga little downcast, more than anything else, and ate some sausage along with ahard biscuit washed down with water. After her first bite, she lifted thesausage to him, meeting his gaze in a questioning manner. He didn’t acknowledgethe offer. Nicci assumed he declined, and went back to eating.When she was finished and had washed in the brook, she went behind the thickundergrowth for a time. When she came back, she crawled into her bedroll withouta word, turned away from him, and went to sleep.Richard sat on the mossy ground, arms folded, leaning the small of his backagainst his saddle. He didn’t sleep the entire night. He sat watching Niccisleep in the light of the overcast sky lit from the other side by a nearly fullmoon, watching her slow even breathing, her slightly parted lips, the slow pulsein the vein at the side of her throat, thinking the whole time how he mightovercome what she had done to them. He thought about strangling her, but he knewbetter.He had used magic before. He had in the past not only felt but unleashedincredible power through his gift. He had faced situations of enormous dangerinvolving a wide variety of magic. Richard had called upon his gift to conjuresuch power as no one living had ever seen, and he had watched as it was broughtto life at his conscious direction.His gift was invoked mostly through anger and need. He had an abundant supply ofboth. He just didn’t know how it could help him. He didn’t understand wellenough what Nicci had done to begin to think of what he might do to counter it.With Kahlan’s life at the other end of Nicci’s invisible cord of magic, he darednot do anything until he was sure of it. He would be, though; he just had tofigure it out. Experience told him that it was a reasonable supposition. He toldhimself it was only a matter of time. If he wanted to keep his sanity, he knewhe had to believe that.The next morning, without speaking a word to Nicci, he saddled the horses. Shesat watching him tighten the cinch straps, making sure they weren’t pinching thehorses, as she sipped from a waterskin. She took bread from her saddlebag lyingbeside her and asked if he would like a piece. Richard ignored her.He would have been tired from not sleeping the whole cold night, but his angerkept him wide awake. Under a leaden sky, they rode at an easy but steady paceall that day through forests that seemed endless. It felt good to have a warmhorse under him. Throughout the day, they continued their gradual descent fromthe higher country, where the house was, down into the lowlands.Toward dark, the snow arrived.At first, it was just a few furtive flakes swirling through the air. As itsteadily increased, it seemed to leach the color from trees and ground alike,until the world turned white. Visibility steadily diminished as the snowthickened into a disorienting, drifting, solid wall. He had to keep blinking thefat flakes from his eyes.For the first time since leaving with Nicci, Richard felt a sense of relief.Kahlan and Cara, up higher in the mountains, would wake in the morning toseveral feet of snow. They would decide that it was foolish to try to leavewhen, they would believe, it was only an early snow that would melt down enoughin a few days for them to have an easier time of traveling. Up in thosemountains, that would be a mistake. It would stay cold. A storm would follow onthe heels of this one, and they would soon have snow up to the shutters. Theywould be nervous about waiting, but would probably decide that it was now moreimportant for them to delay until a break in the weather-after all, there was nourgency.In all likelihood, they would end up safely stuck in the house for the winter.When he eventually escaped from Nicci’s talons, Richard would find Kahlan snugin their home.He decided that it would be foolish to let his anger dictate that they sleep onthe open ground. They could freeze to death. He recalled all too well that ifNicci died, Kahlan died. When he spotted a big wayward pine, he walked his horseoff the trail. Brushing against branches dumped wet snow on him. Richard flickedit off his shoulders and shook it from his hair.Nicci glanced around, confused, but didn’t object. She dismounted as she waitedto see what he was doing. When he held a heavy bough to the side for her, shefrowned at him before poking her head inside for a look. She straightened withan expression of childlike delight. Richard didn’t return her wide grin.Inside, under the thick boughs caked with snow, was a still, frigid world. Withthe snow crusting the tree, it was dark inside. In the dim light, Richard dug asmall fire pit and soon caught fire to the deadwood he’d carefully stacked overshavings.When the crackling flames built into a warm glow, Nicci gazed around in wonderat the inside of the wayward pine. The spoke-like branches over their heads werecast in a soft orange blush by the flickering light. The lower trunk was bare oflimbs, leaving the inside of the tree a hollow cone with ample open space at thebottom for them.Nicci quietly warmed her hands by the fire, looking contented-not like she wasgloating that he’d given in and found shelter and built a fire, but contented.She looked as if she had been through a great ordeal, and now she could be atpeace. She looked like a woman expecting nothing, but grateful for what she had.Richard hadn’t had breakfast with her, or anything the day before. His bitterresolve gave way to his hunger, so he boiled water from melted snow and cookedrice and beans. Starving wouldn’t do him or Kahlan any good. Without words, heoffered Nicci half the rice and beans poured into the crust of one end of hisloaf of bread. She took the bread bowl and thanked him.She offered him a sun-dried slice of meat. Richard stared at her thin, delicatefingers holding out the piece of meat. It reminded him of someone feeding achipmunk. He snatched the meat from her hand and tore off a chunk with histeeth. To avoid her gaze, he watched the fire as he ate his rice and beans outof the heel of bread. Other than the crackle of the fire, the only sound was thethump of snow falling in clumps from limbs not stout enough to hold the load.Snowfalls often turned a forest to a place of eerie stillness.Sitting by the low fire after he’d finished his meal, feeling the warmth of theflames on his face, the exhaustion from the long ride on top of his vigil thenight before finally caught up with him. Richard stacked thicker wood on thedwindling fire and banked the coals around it. He unrolled his bedroll on theopposite side of the fire from Nicci as she silently watched him, climbed in,and, as he thought about Kahlan safe in their house, fell soundly asleep.The next day they were up early. Nicci said nothing, but, once they weremounted, decisively cut her dappled mare in front of the black stallion and tookthe lead. The snow had changed to a cold drizzling mist. What snow was left onthe ground had melted down to gray slush. The lowlands were not quite ready torelinquish themselves to winter’s grip. Up higher, where Kahlan was, it wascolder and would be snowing in earnest.As they rode carefully along a narrow road at the side of a mountain, Richardtried to watch the woods to keep his mind on other things, but he couldn’t helpoccasionally looking at Nicci riding right in front of him. It was cold anddamp; she wore a heavy black cloak over her black dress. With her back straight,her head held high, and her blond hair fanned out over her cloak, she lookedregal. He wore his dark forest clothes and hadn’t shaved.Nicci’s dappled mare was dark gray, almost black, with lighter gray rings overits body. Its mane was dark gray, as were the lightly feathered legs, and thetail was a milky white. It was one of the most handsome horses Richard had everseen. He hated it. It was hers.By afternoon, they intersected a trail running to the south. Nicci, leading theway, continued to the east. Before the day was out they would encounter a fewmore paths, used mainly by an occasional hunter or trapper. The mountains wereinhospitable. Even if you cleared the ground of trees, the soil was thin androcky. In a few places closer to Hartland or other population centers to thenorth or south, there were grassy slopes that were able to support thin flocksof sheep or goats.As he felt the stallion’s muscles moving beneath him, Richard looked out at landhe knew and loved. He didn’t know how long it would be until he was homeagain-if ever. He hadn’t asked where they were going, figuring Nicci wouldn’tlikely tell him this soon. That they were headed east didn’t mean much just yetbecause their choice of routes was limited.In the passive rhythm of the ride, Richard’s mind kept returning to his sword,and how he had given it to Kahlan. At the time it had seemed the only thing todo. He hated that he had given it to her the way he had, yet he could think ofno other way to afford her any protection. He prayed she would never have to usethe sword. If she did, he’d given it a measure of his rage, too.At his belt he wore a fine knife, but he felt naked without his sword. He hatedthe ancient weapon, the way it pulled dark things from within him, and at thesame time he missed it. He often reminded himself of Zedd’s words, that it wasmerely a tool.It was more, too. The sword was a mirror, albeit one bound in magic capable ofraining terrible destruction. The Sword of Truth would annihilate anythingbefore it-flesh or steel-as long as what stood before it was the enemy, yet itcould not harm a friend. Therein lay the paradox of its magic: evil was definedsolely by the perceptions of the person holding the sword, by what he believedto be true.Richard was the true Seeker and heir to the power of the sword created by thewizards in the great war. It should be with him. He should be protecting thesword.A lot of things “should be,” he told himself.Late in the afternoon they left the eastern path they were on and took onetending east and south. Richard knew the trail; it would pass through a villagein another day, and then become a narrow road. Since Nicci had deliberatelytaken the new route, she must have known that, too.Near dark they skirted the north shore of a good-sized lake. A small raft ofseagulls floated out near the middle of the rain-swept water. Seagulls weren’tcommon in these parts, but they were not unheard of, either. He recalled all theseabirds he had seen when he had been in the Old World. The sea had fascinatedhim.In a cove on the far shore Richard could just make out two men fishing. On thatside of the lake there was a trail worn to a deep rut over many generations bypeople coming up to fish from a hamlet to the south.The two men, sitting on a broad flat rock jutting out into the lake, waved ingreeting. It wasn’t often one encountered riders out here. Richard and Nicciwere too far away for the men to make them out. The men probably assumed theywere trappers.Nicci returned the wave in a casual manner, as if to say, “Good luck with thefishing. Wish we could join you.”They rounded a bend and finally disappeared from the men. Richard wiped his wethair off his forehead as they rode along beside the lake, listening to the smallwaves lapping at the muddy shore. Leaving the lake behind, they cut into theforest as the trail rose on its way across a gentle slope. Nicci had put herhood up against the intermittent rain and drizzle purring through the trees. Adarkening gloom descended on the woods.Richard didn’t want to do anything that would get Kahlan killed; the time hadfinally come when he had to speak.“When we come upon someone, what am I to say? I don’t suppose you want metelling people you’re a Sister of the Dark out snatching victims. Or do you wishme to play the part of a mute?”Nicci gave him a sidelong glance.“You will be my husband, as far as everyone is concerned,” she said withouthesitation. “I expect you to adhere to that story under all circumstances. Forall practical purposes, from now on, you are my husband. I am your wife.”Richard’s fists tightened on the reins. “I have a wife. You are not she. I’m notgoing to pretend you are.”Swaying gently in her saddle, Nicci seemed indifferent to his words or theemotion behind them. She gazed skyward, taking in the darkening sky.It was too warm down in the lowlands for snow. Through occasional breaks in thelow clouds, though, Richard had caught glimpses of windswept mountain slopesbehind them cloaked in thick white drifts. Kahlan was sure to be dry, warm, andstuck.“Do you think you could find us another of those shelter trees?” Nicci asked.“Where it would be dry, like last night? I’d dearly love to get dry and warm.”Between sporadic gaps in the pine trees, and through the scramble of barebranches of the alder and ash, Richard surveyed the hillside descending beforethem.“Yes.”“Good. We need to have a talk.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 25As Richard dismounted near one of his shelter trees at the edge of a small,slanted, open patch of grassy ground, Nicci took the reins of his horse. Shecould feel his smoldering glare on her back as she picketed the horses to thethick branches of an alder heavy with catkins. The horses were hungry, andpromptly started cropping the wet grass. Without a word, Richard began castingabout, collecting deadwood from under dense thickets of spruce trees, where, shesupposed, it might be a little dryer.She watched him, not openly, but casually, covertly, from the corner of her eyeas he went about his chore. He was everything she remembered, and more. It wasnot so much that he was just big, physically, but he had a commanding presencethat had matured since she had last seen him. Before, she had been tempted attimes to think of him as little more than a boy. No more.Now, he was a powerful wild stallion trapped in a pen of his own construction.She kept her distance, letting him kick at the walls of that pen. It would bringher no gain to taunt this wild beast. Taunting him, torturing him in hisanguish, was the last thing in the world she wanted.Nicci could understand his smoldering anger. It was to be expected. She couldplainly see his feelings for the Mother Confessor, and hers for him. Theintegrity of the walls of his pen consisted of nothing more than the gossamerfence rails of his feelings for her. While Nicci sympathized with his pain, sheknew that she, of all people, could do nothing to alleviate it. It would taketime for his hurt to heal. Over time, the rails of his fence would be replacedby others.Someday, he would come to terms with what had to be. Someday, he would come tounderstand the truth of the things she intended to show him. Someday, he wouldcome to understand the necessity of what she was doing. It was for the best.At the edge of the clearing, Nicci settled herself on a gray slab of granitethat, by the unique angles of its broken face, had once belonged to the ledgepoking out from under the deep green of balsam and spruce behind her, but overtime had been moved away from it by the inexorable effort of nature, leaving agap the shape of a jagged lightning bolt between their once-mated edges.Nicci sat with her back straight, a habit instilled in her from a young age byher mother, and watched Richard going about unsaddling the horses. He let themboth eat some oats from canvas nosebags while he collected rocks from theclearing. At first, she couldn’t imagine what he was doing. When he took them,along with the wood he had collected, in under the boughs of the shelter tree,she realized he must be going to use the rocks to ring a fire pit. He was insidea long time, so she knew he must be working on building a fire out of the wetwood. She could have used her gift to help, had her gift enough power left tolight wet wood. It didn’t.Richard seemed up to the task, though; she had watched him light a fire thenight before, starting it in birch bark, shavings, and twigs. Nicci had neverbeen one for such outdoor activities. She left him to it and set about the smallchore of repairing her horse’s cinch strap. The rain had let up for the timebeing, leaving behind the tingle of a fine mist against her cheeks.As she worked at knotting the loose cords of the heavy twine strap back onto itsbuckle, she heard little crackling sounds coming from under the tree. Thesputtering and popping told her that Richard had gotten the fire going. Sheheard the clang of a pot on rock, so she reasoned that we was leaving water toboil when the fire got hot enough.Sitting on the slab of granite, Nicci quietly worked a tangle out of the cinchstrap as he came back out to care for the horses. Free of the nosebags, thehorses drank from a pool of water in a depression in the smooth tan ledge.Though Richard wore dark clothes appropriate for the woods, they could notdiminish his bearing. His gray-eyed gaze swept over her, taking in what she wasdoing. He left her to her knot work as he went about his chore of currying thehorses. His big hands worked smoothly, with a sure touch. She was certain thehorses would appreciate having all the caked mud cleaned from their legs. Shewould, were she they.“You said we needed to talk,” Richard finally said to her as he stroked thecurry comb over the mare’s rump, whisking away a last spatter of mud. “I presumea talk consists of you dictating the terms of my imprisonment. I imagine youhave rules for your captives.”By his icy inflection, it sounded as if he had decided to provoke her a little,to test her reaction. Nicci set the cinch strap aside. She met his challengingtone with one of genuine sympathy, instead.“Just because something has happened to you before, Richard, don’t assume thatmeans it will again. Fate does not give birth to the same child over and over.Each is different. This is not like the two times before.”Her response, as well as the compassion in her eyes, appeared to have caught himoff guard. He stared at her a moment before crouching to replace the curry combin a pocket in the saddlebag and take out a pick.“Two times before?” There was no way he could miss her meaning. His blankexpression didn’t betray what he might be thinking as he lifted the stallion’sright forefoot to pick its hoof clean. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”Just as he probed the hoof with his pick, she knew he was probing her as well,wanting to know just how much she knew of those two times, and what she thoughtwas different, this time. He would surely want to know how she intended to avoidthe mistakes of his past captors. Any warrior would.He was not yet ready to accept how fundamentally different this was.Richard worked his way around the big black horse, cleaning its hooves, until heended at the left forefoot, close to her. As he finished and let the stallion’sleg down, Nicci stood. When he turned around, she was close enough to feel hiswarm breath on her cheek. He fixed her with his glare, a look that was no longeras unsettling to her as it had been at first.She found herself, instead of shrinking back, staring into that penetrating gazeof his, marveling that she had him. She finally had him. It could have been nomore wondrous to her had she somehow managed to bottle the moon and stars.“You are a prisoner,” Nicci said. “Your anger and resentment are entirelyunderstandable. I would never have expected you to be pleased about this,Richard. But it is not the same as those times before.” She gently gripped histhroat. He was surprised, but sensed he was in no immediate danger. “Before,”she said in quiet solace, “you had a collar around your neck. Both times.”“You were at the Palace of the Prophets, where I was taken.” She felt himswallow. “But the other . . .”She released his throat. “I do not use a collar, as did the Sisters of theLight, to control you, to give you pain in order to make you obey, or to put youthrough their ridiculous tests. My purpose is nothing like that.”She pulled her cloak forward over her shoulders as she smiled distantly.“Remember when you first came to the Palace of the Prophets? Remember the speechyou gave?”Richard’s words were brittle with caution. “Not . . . exactly.”She was still staring off into the memories. “I do. It was the first time I sawyou. I remember every word.”Richard said nothing, but in his eyes she could see the shadows of his mindworking.“You were in a rage-not unlike now. You held out a red leather rod hangingaround your neck. Remember, Richard?”“I guess I did.” His suspicious glare broke. “A lot has happened since then. Iguess I’d put it out of my mind.”“You said that you had been collared before. You said that the person who hadonce put that collar around your neck had brought you pain to punish you, toteach you.”His posture shifted to stiff wariness. “What of it?”She focused once more on his gray eyes, eyes that watched her every blink, herevery breath, as he weighed her every word. It was all going into some innercalculation, she knew-some inner master analysis of how high was his fence, andif he could jump it. He could not.“I always wondered about that,” she said. “About what you had said about havingbeen in a collar before. Some months back, we captured a woman in red leather. AMord-Sith.” His color paled just a little. “She said she was searching for LordRahl, to protect him. I persuaded her to tell me everything she knew about you.”“I’m not from D’Hara.” His voice sounded confident, nevertheless, she sensed asubterranean torrent of dread. “A Mord-Sith would know next to nothing aboutme.”Nicci reached inside her cloak for the thing she had brought with her. She letthe small red leather rod roll from her fingers to fall to the ground at hisfeet. He stiffened.“Oh, but she did, Richard. She knew a great deal.” She smiled a small smile, notpleasure, nor mockery, but in distant sadness at the memory of that brave woman.“She knew Denna. She had been at the People’s Palace in D’Hara, where you weretaken after Denna captured you. She knew all about it.”Richard’s gaze fell away. On bended knee he reverently picked the red leatherrod off the wet ground. He wiped the thing clean on his pant leg as if it werepriceless.“A Mord-Sith would not tell you anything.” He stood and boldly met her gaze. “AMord-Sith is a product of torture. She would say only enough to make you believeshe was cooperating. She would feed you a clever lie to deceive you. She woulddie before speaking any words to harm her Lord Rahl.”With one long finger, Nicci pulled a sodden strand of blond hair off her cheek.“You underestimate me, Richard. That woman was very brave. I felt great sorrowfor her, but there were things I wanted to know. She told it all. She told meeverything I wanted to know.”Nicci could see the rage rising in him, bringing a flush to his cheeks. That wasnot what she had intended, or wanted. She was telling him the truth, but herejected it, trying to overlay it instead with his own false assumptions.A moment passed, and that truth finally found its way into his eyes. The ragedeparted reluctantly, replaced by the weight of sadness that made him swallow athis grief for this woman. Nicci had expected no less from him.“Apparently,” Nicci whispered, “Denna was very talented at torture-”“I neither need nor want your sympathy.”“But I did feel sympathy, Richard, for what that woman put you through for nopurpose but to give pain. That’s the worst kind of pain, isn’t it?-pain to nobenefit, no confession? The pointlessness of it only adds to its torture. Thatwas what you suffered.”Nicci gestured to the red leather weapon in his fist. “This woman did not sufferthat kind of pain. I want you to know that.”He pressed his lips tight in mistrust as he looked away from her eyes, gazingout at the gathering darkness.“You killed her, this Mord-Sith named Denna, but not before she did unspeakablethings to you.”“So I did.” Richard’s expression hardened with the implied menace of his words.“You threatened the Sisters of the Light because they, too, collared you. Youtold them they were not good enough to lick the boots of that woman, Denna, andso they were not. You told the Sisters that they thought they held the leash toyour collar, but you promised them that they would find that what they held wasa bolt of lightning. Don’t think for one moment that I don’t understand yourfeelings in this, or your resolve.”Nicci reached out and tapped the center of his chest.“But this time, Richard, the collar is around your heart and it is Kahlan whowill be forfeit, should you make a mistake.”His fists, at the ends of his rigid arms, tightened. “Kahlan would rather diethan have me be a slave at her expense. She begged me to forfeit her life for myfreedom. A day may dawn when it becomes necessary for me to honor her request.”Nicci felt a weary boredom at his threats. People so often resorted tothreatening her.“That is entirely up to you, Richard. But you make a great mistake if you thinkI care.”She couldn’t begin to recall how many times Jagang had made solemn threats onher life, or how many of those times his hands had tightened around her throatchoking the life out of her after he had beaten her senseless. Kadar Kardeef hadat times been no less brutal. She’d lost count of the times she fully expectedto die, starting with the time when she was little and the man pulled her intothe alley to rob her.But such men were not the only ones who promised her suffering.“I cannot tell you the promises the Keeper of the underworld has made to me inmy dreams, promises of unending suffering. That is my fate.“So, please, Richard, do not think to frighten me with your petty threats. Moresavage men than you have made credible promises as to my doom. I long agoaccepted my fate and ceased to care.”Her arms felt heavy at her sides. She felt empty of feeling. Thoughts of Jagang,of the Keeper, reminded her that her life was meaningless. Only what she hadseen in Richard’s eyes gave her a hint that there might be something more,something she had yet to discover or understand.“What is it you want?” Richard demanded.Nicci returned her mind to the here and now. “I told you. Your part in life nowis as my husband. That is the way it is going to be-if you wish Kahlan to live.I’ve told you the truth about all of it. If you come with me and do the simplethings I ask, such as assuming the role of my husband, then Kahlan will live along life. I can’t say it will be entirely happy, of course, for I know sheloves you.”“How long do you think you can hold me, Nicci?” In frustration, Richard ran hisfingers back through his wet hair. “It isn’t going to work, whatever it is youwant. How long until you tire of this absurd sham?”Her eyes narrowed, studying his profound innocence, if not ignorance.“My dear boy, I was born into this wretched world one hundred and eighty-oneyears past. You know that. Do you suppose I have not learned a great deal ofpatience, in all that time`? Though our bodies may look about the same age, andin many ways I am no older than you, I have lived near to seven of yourlifetimes. Do you honestly believe that you would have patience to exceed mine?Do you think me some young foolish girl for you to outwit or outwait?”His demeanor cooled. “Nicci, I….”“And don’t think to make friends with me, or win me over. I am not Denna, orVerna, or Warren, or even Pasha, for that matter. I’m not interested infriends.”He turned a little and ran a hand over the stallion’s shoulder when the horsesnorted and stamped a hoof at the smell of the woodsmoke curling out from theupper limbs of the shelter tree.“I want to know what vile thing you did to that poor woman to make her tell youabout Denna.”“The Mord-Sith told me in return for a favor.”Frowning his incredulity, he turned to her once more. “What favor could youpossibly do for a MordSith?”“I cut her throat.”Richard closed his eyes as his head sank with grief for this unknown woman whohad died because of him. He clenched her weapon in his fist to his heart.His voice lost its fire. “I don’t suppose you know her name?”It was this, his empathy for others, even others he didn’t know, that not onlymade him the man he was, but shackled him. His concern for others would also bethe thing that eventually brought him to understand the virtue in what she wasdoing. He, too, would then willingly work for the righteous cause of the Order.“I do.” Nicci said. “Hania.”“Hania.” He looked heartsick. “I didn’t even know her.”“Richard.” With a finger under his chin, Nicci gently brought his face up. “Iwant you to know that I did not torture her. I found her being tortured. I wasnot happy about what I saw. I killed the man who did it. Hania was beyond anyhelp. I offered her release from her pain, a quick end, if she would tell meabout you. I never asked her to betray you in any way that the Order would want.I asked only about your past, about your first captivity. I wanted to understandwhat you said that first day at the Palace of the Prophets, that’s all.”Richard didn’t look relieved, as she had intended.“You withheld that quick release, as you call it, until she had given you whatyou wanted. That makes you a party to her torture.”In the gloom, Nicci looked away in pain and anguish at the memory of that bloodydeed. It had long since lost its ability to make her feel anything more than aghost of emotions.There were so many needing release from their suffering-so many old and sick, somany wailing children, so many destitute and hopeless and poor. This woman hadmerely been another of life’s victims needing release. It was for the best.Nicci had renounced the Creator in order to do His work, and sworn her soul tothe Keeper of the underworld. She had to; only one as evil as she would fail tofeel any fitting feelings, any proper compassion, for all the suffering anddesperate need. It was grim irony-faithfully serving the needy in such a way.“Perhaps you see it that way, Richard,” Nicci said in a hoarse voice as shestared into the numb nightmare of memories. “I did not. Neither did Hania.Before I cut her throat for her, she thanked me for what I was about to do.”Richard’s eyes offered no mercy. “And why did you make her tell you aboutme-about Denna?”Nicci snagged her cloak tighter on her shoulders. “Isn’t it obvious?”“You couldn’t possibly make the same mistake Denna made. You aren’t the womanshe was, Nicci.”She was tired. The first night, he had not slept, she knew. She had felt hiseyes on her back. She knew how much he hurt. Turned away from him, she had weptsilently at the hate his eyes held, at the burden of being the one to have to dowhat was best. The world was such an evil place.“Perhaps, Richard,” she said in a soft voice, “you will someday teach me thedifference.”She was so very tired. The night before, when he had succumbed to his weariness,and turned away from her to sleep, Nicci had in turn stayed awake all night,watching him in his sound sleep as she felt the connection of magic to theMother Confessor. The connection brought Nicci great empathy for her, as well.It was all for the best.“For now,” Nicci said, “let’s get inside out of this foul weather. I’m cold andI’m hungry. We need to get some rest, too. And as I’ve told you, we have thingsto discuss, first.”She couldn’t lie to him, she knew. She couldn’t tell him everything, of course,but she dared not lie to him in the things she did tell him.The dance had begun."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 26Richard broke up the sausage Nicci gave him from her saddlebag and tossed it inthe pot with the simmering rice. The things she had told him kept shouting inhis mind as he tried to fit them into their proper order.He didn’t know how much of what she had said he dared to believe. He feared itwas all true. Nicci just didn’t seem to need to lie to him-at least not aboutwhat she had told him so far. She didn’t seem as . . . hostile, as he thoughtshe would have to be. If anything, she seemed melancholy, perhaps because ofwhat she had done-although, he had trouble believing that a confessed Sister ofthe Dark would suffer a guilty conscience. It was probably just some bizarrepart of her act, some artifice directed toward her ends.He stirred the pot of rice with a stick he’d peeled the bark off of. “You saidthere were things to discuss.” He rapped the stick clean on the edge of the pot.“I assume that means there are orders you wish to issue.”Nicci blinked, as if he’d caught her thinking about something else. She lookedout of place, sitting prim and straight in a wayward pine, dressed as she was inher fine black dress. Richard would never before have ever thought of Nicciout-of-doors, much less sitting on the ground. The very idea had always seemedludicrous to him. Her dress constantly made him think of Kahlan, not onlybecause of it being so completely opposite that it evoked the comparison, butalso because he so vividly recalled Nicci connected to Kahlan by that awful ropeof magic.That memory twisted him in agony.“Orders?” Nicci folded her hands in her lap and met his gaze. “Oh, yes, I have afew requests I wish you to honor. First, you may not use your gift. Not at all.Not in any way. Is that clear? Since, as I recall, you have no love of the gift,this should be neither a burden nor a difficult request for you to follow,especially because there is something you do love which would not survive such abetrayal. Do you understand?”Her cold blue eyes conveyed the threat perhaps even better than her words.Richard gave her a single nod, committing himself to what, exactly, he wasn’tentirely sure at the moment.He poured her steaming dinner in a shallow wooden bowl and handed it to heralong with a spoon. Nicci smiled her thanks. He set the pot on the groundbetween his legs and took a spoonful of rice, blowing on it until it was coolenough to eat. He watched her from the corner of his eye as she took a daintytaste.Beyond her physical perfection, Nicci had a singularly expressive face. Sheseemed to go cold and blank when she was unhappy, or when she meant to conveyanger, threat, or displeasure. She didn’t really scowl the way other people didwhen they felt those emotions; rather, a look of cool detachment descended onher. That look was, in its own way, far more disturbing. It was her impenetrablearmor.On the other hand, she was expressively animated when she was pleased orthankful. Even more than that, though, such pleasure or gratitude appearedgenuine. He remembered her as aloof, and while she still possessed a noblebearing, to some extent her air of reticence had lifted to reveal an innocentdelight in any kindness, or even simple courtesy.Richard still had bread Cara had baked for him. He hated sharing that bread withthis evil woman, but it now seemed a childish consideration. He tore off a pieceand offered it to Nicci. She took it with the reverence due something greaterthan mere bread.“I also expect you to keep no secrets from me,” she said after another bite.“You would not like me to discover you were doing so. Husbands and wives have noneed for secrets.”Richard supposed not, but they were hardly husband and wife. Rather than say so,he said instead, “You seem to know a lot about how husbands and wives behave.”Rather than rising to his bait, she gestured with her bread at her bowl. “Thisis very good, Richard. Very good indeed.”“What is it you want, Nicci? What is the purpose of this absurd pretense?”The firelight played across her alabaster face, and lent her hair a torrid colorit didn’t in reality possess. “I took you because I need an answer which Ibelieve you will provide.”Richard broke a stout branch in two across his knee. “You said husbands andwives have no need for secrets.” He used half the branch to push the burningwood together before placing the branch atop the fire. “Then aren’t wives, too,supposed to be honest?”“Of course.” Her hand with the bread lowered. She rested her wrist over herknee. “I will be honest with you, too, Richard.”“Then what’s the question? You said you took me because you need an answer youthink I can provide. What’s the question?”Nicci stared oft again. once more looking anything but the grim captor. Shelooked as if memories, or perhaps fears, haunted her. It was somehow moreunsettling than the sneer of an armed guard outside of the bars of his cage.The rain outside had increased to a dull roar. They’d made camp just in time.Richard couldn’t help but remember the cozy times he’d had in wayward pineshuddled beside Kahlan. At the thought of Kahlan, his heart sank.“I don’t know,” Nicci finally said. “I honestly don’t, Richard. I seeksomething, but I will only know it when I find it. After nearly all my onehundred and eighty one years without knowing it existed, I finally saw the firsthint of it not long ago . . . .” She seemed to be looking through him again, tosome point beyond. Her voice, too, seemed to be addressed to that distant placeher vision beheld. “That was when you stood in a collar before all thoseSisters, and defied them. Perhaps I will find the answer when I understand whatit was I saw that day, in that room. It was not just you, but you were itscenter .. .”Her eyes focused once more on his face. She spoke with gentle assurance. “Untilthen, you will live. I have no intention of harming you. You need fear notorture from me. I’m not like them-that woman, Denna, or like the Sisters of theLight, using you for their games.”“Don’t patronize me. You are using me for your own game, no less than they usedme for theirs.”She shook her head. “I want you to know, Richard, that I have nothing butrespect for you. I probably have more respect for you than any person you haveever met. That’s why I took you. You are a rare person, Richard.”“I’m a war wizard. You’ve just never seen one of those before.”She spurned the notion with a dismissive flick of her hand. “Please don’t try toimpress me with your `power.’ I’m not in the mood for such silliness.”Richard knew it was no idle boast on her part. She was a sorceress of remarkableability. He doubted he had any hope of outsmarting her knowledge of magic.She was not acting the way he had expected a Sister of the Dark would act,though. Richard put his anger, hurt, and heartache aside for the moment, knowinghe had to face what was, rather than putting his hope in wishes, and spoke toNicci in the same gentle fashion she used with him.“I don’t understand what it is you want of me, Nicci.”She shrugged in an involuntary gesture of frustration. “Neither do I. Until Ido, you will do as I ask and everything will be fine. I will not harm you.”“Considering the circumstances, do you really expect me to take your word?”“I’m telling you the truth, Richard. If you were to twist your ankle, I would,like a good wife, put my shoulder under your arm and help you to walk. From nowon, I am devoted to you, and you to me.”He could only blink at how crazy this was. He almost thought she might be mad.Almost. He knew that would be too easy an answer. As Zedd always said, nothingwas ever easy.“And if I choose not to go along with your wishes?”Again, she shrugged. “Then Kahlan dies.”“I understand that, but if she dies, then you lose the collar around my heart.”She fixed him with cold blue eyes. “Your point?”“Then you couldn’t get what you wanted from me. You would have no leverage.”“I don’t have what I want now, so I would be losing nothing. Besides, if youwere to do that, then Emperor Jagang would welcome your head as a gift. I wouldno doubt be showered with gifts and riches.”Richard didn’t think Nicci wanted gifts or riches showered on her. She was aSister of the Dark, after all, and he supposed she could manage to be soshowered if she really wished it.Even so, he was sure his head would have a price, and she could salvage thatmuch out of it if he proved ungovernable. She might not care for gifts andriches, but if there was one thing she did want, it had to be power. He waspretty sure she could gain a good measure of that, should she slay the enemy ofthe Imperial Order.He bent over the pot between his legs and went back to his dinner, and his darkthoughts. Talking to her was useless. They just went around in circles.“Richard,” she said in a quiet tone, drawing his eyes to her gaze, “you thinkI’m doing this to hurt you, or to defeat you because you are the enemy of theOrder. I am not. I told you my true reasons.”“So, when you finally find this answer you seek, in return for my `help,’ thenyou will let me go?” It was not really meant as a question, but as trenchantincrimination.“Go?” She stared down into her bowl of rice and sausage, stirring it around asif it might reveal a secret. She looked up. “No, Richard, then I will kill you.”“I see.” He hardly thought that was a way to encourage his cooperation in hersearch, but he didn’t say so. “And Kahlan’? After you kill me, I mean.”“You have my word that if I decide I must kill you, as long as I live, she will,too. I have no ill will toward her.”He tried to find solace in that much of it. For some reason, he believed Nicci.Knowing that Kahlan would be all right gave him courage. He could endure whatwas to happen to him, if only she would be all right. It was a price he waswilling to pay.“So, `wife,’ where are we going? Where is it you’re taking me?”Nicci didn’t look at him but instead used her bread to sop up some of herdinner. She considered his question as she nibbled.“Who are you fighting, Richard? Who is your enemy?” She took another small biteof her bread.“Jagang. Jagang and his Imperial Order.”Like an instructor correcting him, Nicci slowly shook her head. “No. You arewrong. I think perhaps you are in need of answers, too.”Games. She was playing foolish games with him. Richard ground his teeth, butheld his temper in check.“Then who, Nicci? Who, or what, am I fighting if it is not Jagang.”“That is what I hope to show you.” She watched his eyes in a way he foundunsettling. “I am going to take you to the Old World, to the heart of the Order,to show you what you are fighting-the taste nature of what you believe to beyour enemy.”Richard frowned. “Why’?”Nicci smiled. “Let’s just say it amuses me.”“You mean we’re going back to Tanimura? Back to where you lived all that time asa Sister?”“No. We are going to the heart and soul of the Old World: Altur’Rang. Jagang’shomeland. The name means, roughly, `the Creator’s chosen.’ “Richard felt a chill run up his spine. “You expect to take me, Richard Rahl,there, into the heart of enemy territory? I hardly doubt we will be living as`husband and wife’ for long.”“Besides not using your magic, you will not use the name associated with thatmagic-Rahl-but instead the name you grew up with: Richard Cypher. Without yourmagic, or your name, no one will know you are anyone but a humble man with hiswife. That is exactly what you shall be-what we both shall be.”Richard sighed. “Well, if the enemy should find I’m more, I guess a Sister ofthe Dark can . . . exert her influence.”“No, I can’t.”Richard’s eyes turned up. “What do you mean?”“I can’t use my power.”Gooseflesh prickled his arms. “What?”“It’s devoted to the link with Kahlan, to keeping her alive. That is how amaternity spell works. It requires a prodigious amount of power to evenestablish such a complex spell, much less maintain it. My power must be investedinto the labor of preserving the living link. A maternity spell leaves nothingto spare; I doubt I could make a spark.“If we have any trouble, you will have to handle it. Of course, I can at anytime call upon my ability as a sorceress, but to do so I would have to draw thepower from our link. If I do that without her near . . . Kahlan dies.”Alarm raced through him. “But what if you accidentally. . .”“I won’t. As long as you take good care of me, Kahlan will be safe enough. If,however, I should fall off my horse and break my neck, her neck snaps, too. Aslong as you take good care of me, you are taking good care of her. This is whyit’s important that we live as husband and wife-so that you can be close athand, and so that I can guide and help you, too. It will be a difficult lifewith both of us living without our power, just as any other married couple, butI believe this to be necessary if I am to find what I seek from you. Do youunderstand?”He wasn’t sure he really did, but he said “Yes,” anyway.Numb dismay swamped him. He would never have believed this woman would havewillingly given up her power for some unspecified knowledge. The very idea of itunleashed cold panic through his veins.Richard couldn’t make sense of it. With his mind groping blindly in a world goneinsane, he spoke without even considering his words.“I’m already married. I’ll not sleep with you as your husband.”Nicci blinked in surprise, then let out a dainty titter, covering it with theback of her hand, not in shyness, but at his presumption. Richard felt his earsheating.“That is not the way in which I want you, Richard.”Richard cleared his throat. “Good.”In the quiet of the wayward pine, with the rain outside falling in a gentlepatter and the glowing checkered wood hissing softly, Nicci’s focused, intense,resolute expression turned very cold and very still.“But if I should decide I do, Richard, you will comply with that, too.”Nicci was a beautiful woman, the kind of woman most any man would eagerlyaccept. It was hardly that, though, that made him believe her. It was the lookin her eyes. Never had the vague possibility of the act of sex seemed sovicious.Her voice lost the conversational quality. It went on in a lifeless drone, athing not human, pronouncing a sentence on his life. A sentence he himself wouldenforce, or Kahlan would die.“You will act as my husband. You will provide for us as any husband would. Youwill care for me, and I for you, in the sense of worldly needs. I will mend yourshirts and cook your meals and wash your clothes. You will provide us with aliving.”Nicci’s leaden words slammed into him with the deliberate methodical force of abeating delivered with an iron bar.“You will never see Kahlan again-you must understand that-but as long as you doas I wish, you will know she lives. In that way you will be able to show yourlove for her. Every day she wakes, she will know you are keeping her alive. Youhave no other way to show her your love.”He felt sick to his stomach. He stared off into memories of another place andtime.“And if I choose to end it?” The weight of such madness was so crushing that heearnestly considered it. “Rather than be your slave?”“Then perhaps that is the form the knowledge I seek will take. Maybe thatsenseless end will be what I must learn.” She brought her first and secondfingers together in a snipping motion, simulating the cutting of the umbilicalcord of magic that sustained Kahlan’s life. “One last evil convulsion to finallyconfirm the senselessness of existence.”It dawned on Richard that this woman could not be threatened, because she was acreature who, he was beginning to understand, welcomed any terrible outcome.“Of all there is to me in this world,” he whispered in dim agony, more tohimself and to Kahlan than to his implacable captor, “there is only one thingthat is irreplaceable: Kahlan. If I must be a slave in order for Kahlan to live,then I shall be a slave.”Richard realized Nicci was silently studying his face. He met her gaze briefly,then looked away, unable to bear the terrible scrutiny of her beautiful blueeyes while he held the image of Kahlan’s love in his mind.“Whatever you shared with her, whatever happiness, joy, or pleasure, will alwaysbe yours, Richard.” Nicci seemed almost to be peering inside him, reading thepages of his past written in his mind. “Treasure those memories. They will haveto sustain you. You will never see her again, nor she you. That chapter of yourlife is ended. You both have new lives, now. You may as well get used to itbecause that is the reality of the situation.”The reality of what was. Not the world as he would wish it. He himself had toldKahlan that they must act according to the reality of what was, and not wastetheir precious lives wishing for things that could not be.Richard ran his fingertips across his forehead as he tried to hold his voicesteady. “I hope you don’t expect me to learn to be pleased with you.”“I am the one, Richard, who expects to learn.”Fists at his side, Richard shot to his feet. “And what is it you wish thisknowledge for?” he demanded in unrestrained, violent bitterness. “Why is it soimportant to you!”“As punishment.”Richard stared in stunned disbelief. “What?”“I wish to hurt, Richard.” She smiled distantly.Richard sank back to the ground.“Why?” he whispered.Nicci folded her hands in her lap. “Pain, Richard, is all that can reach thatcold dead thing within me that is my life. Pain is the only thing for which Ilive.”He stared numbly at her. He thought about his vision. There was nothing he coulddo to fight the advance of the Imperial Order. He could think of nothing hecould do to fight his fate with this woman.If not for Kahlan, he would, at that moment, have thrown himself into a battlewith Nicci that would have decided it once and for all. He would have willinglygone to his death fighting this cruel insanity. Except his reason denied himthat.He had to live so that Kahlan would live. For that, and that alone, he had toput one foot in front of the other and march into oblivion."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 27Kahlan yawned as she rubbed her eyes. Squinting, she arched her back andstretched her sore muscles. The terrible desperate memories swooped in from thesleep-darkened corners of her mind, leaving little chance for any other thoughtsto long survive.She was beyond the realm of merciless anguish and crying; she had entered thesovereign dominion of unbridled anger.Her fingers found the cold steel scabbard of his sword lying at her side. Itfelt alive with icy rage. That, the carving of Spirit, and her memories wereabout all she had of him.There wasn’t a lot of firewood, but since they wouldn’t be needing much moreanyway, Kahlan put another stick of what was left into the fire. She squatted,holding her hands close over the top of the feeble flames, hoping to bringfeeling to her numb fingers. The wind shifted a little. Pungent smoke billowedup into her face, making her cough. The smoke rolled past her face and followedthe rock overhang up and out from their shelter.Cara was gone, so Kahlan pushed the little pot of water back onto the fire towarn it for tea for when the Mord-Sith returned. Cara was probably visitingtheir makeshift privy. Or maybe she was checking the traps they’d set the nightbefore for rabbits. Kahlan didn’t hold out any real hope that they would catch arabbit for their breakfast. Not in this weather. They had brought enoughprovisions, in any event.Through slits in the clouds, the crimson light of a cold crisp dawn penetratedgaps in the snowcrusted limbs of trees to slant in under the rock overhang,casting everything in their little campsite in a blush glow. The two of them hadtried without avail to find a wayward pine. The screen of trees, along with ashort wall of boughs she and Cara had cut and placed the night before to protectthem from the wind, as Richard had taught them to do, shielded the secludedspot. With their improvements it had proven a fit shelter. They had been luckyto find it in the driving snow. Outside, the snow was fairly deep, but in theshelter they had had a relatively dry, if cold, night. Kahlan and Cara hadhuddled together under blankets and their thick wolf fur mantles to keep eachother warm.Kahlan wondered where Richard was, and if he was cold, too. She hoped not.Probably, since he had started out a few days sooner, he had been lucky and hadmade it down to the lowlands already, avoiding the snow.Cara and Kahlan had stayed in their home, as he had asked, for three days. Snowhad arrived the morning after he’d left. Kahlan had been tempted to wait for abreak in the weather before they started out, but she had learned a bitterlesson from Sister Nicci: don’t wait, act. When Richard didn’t return, Kahlanand Cara had immediately struck out.It was hard going at first. They struggled through the drifts, leading thehorses at times, riding them occasionally. They couldn’t see very far, and mostof the time had to keep the wind from the west at their right shoulder as theironly clue as to which direction they faced. It was dangerous traveling over thepasses in such conditions. For a time, they feared that they had made a terriblemistake leaving the safety of their house.Through a break in the clouds just before dark the night before, as they weregathering boughs for their shelter, they’d caught a glimpse of the lower hills;they were green and brown, not white. They would be below the snow line beforelong. Kahlan was confident that they were through the worst of it.As she stuffed an arm into a sleeve, pulling another shirt on over the top ofthe two she was wearing, Kahlan heard the crunch of snow underfoot. When sherealized it was more than one pair of footsteps, she stood up in a rush.Cara pushed her way through the boughs of the sheltering trees. “We havecompany,” she announced in a grim voice. Kahlan saw that Cara’s fist held herAgiel.A bundled up squat woman came through the trees, following in Cara’s footsteps.Under layers of cloaks, scarves, and other dangling corners of thick cloth,Kahlan was surprised to recognize Ann, the old Prelate of the Sisters of theLight.Behind Ann came a taller woman, her scarves pushed back to reveal graying brownhair loose to her shoulders. She had an intense, steady, calculating gaze thathad earned her an enduring network of fine wrinkles radiating out from thecorners of her deep-set eyes. Her brow was less steady, twitching down severaltimes toward her prominent nose. She looked like a woman who used a switch toteach children.“Kahlan!” Ann rushed forward, seizing Kahlan’s arms. “Oh, my dear, it’s so goodto see you!” She looked back when Kahlan glanced up behind her. “This is one ofmy Sisters, Alessandra. Alessandra, may I introduce the Mother ConfessorandRichard’s wife.”The woman stepped forward and smiled. The pleasant grin completely altered herface, instantly erasing the severity of it with open good nature. It was asomewhat disorienting transformation, making her seem like two different peoplesharing one face. Or, Kahlan thought, perhaps one person with two faces.“Mother Confessor, it’s so good to meet you. Ann has told me all about you, andwhat a wonderful person you are.” Her eyes took in the campsite with a quickglance. “I’m so happy for you and Richard.”Ann’s eyes turned left and right, searching. Her gaze snagged on the sword.“Where’s Richard? Cara wouldn’t say a word.” She looked up into Kahlan’s eyes.“Dear Creator,” she whispered. “What’s wrong? What’s happened? Where’s Richard?”Kahlan finally managed to unclench her teeth. “One of your Sisters took him.”Ann pushed her scarves back off her gray hair and took ahold of Kahlan’s armagain. The top of Ann’s head came up only to Kahlan’s chest, but she looked atleast twice as wide.“What are you talking about? What do you mean, a Sister took him? Which Sister?”“Nicci,” Kahlan growled.Ann pulled back. “Nicci . . .”Sister Alessandra gasped. “Sister Nicci?” She crossed both hands over her heart.“Sister Nicci isn’t one of Ann’s. Nicci is a Sister of the Dark.”“Oh, I’m well aware of that,” Kahlan said.“We have to go get him back,” Ann said. “At once. He’s not safe with her.”“There’s no telling what Nicci might-” Sister Alessandra’s mouth snapped shut.The wind carried a sparkling gust into their faces, momentarily whiting out thered dawn. Kahlan blinked the snow away. Cara, in her red leather with both acloak and her heavy fur mantle over top, ignored it. The other two women brushedtheir heavy woolen mittens across their eyes.“Kahlan, everything will be all right,” Ann said in a reassuring voice. “Tellus, now, what’s happened? Tell us everything. Is he hurt?”Kahlan swallowed against her rising rage. “Nicci used what she called amaternity spell on me.”Ann’s mouth fell open. Sister Alessandra gasped again.“Are you sure?” Ann asked in a careful tone. “Are you sure that was what it was?How do you know for sure?”“She slammed some kind of magic into me. I’ve never heard of such a spell. All Iknow is that it was definitely powerful magic and she said it was called amaternity spell. She said that it connects us, somehow, through that magic.”Alessandra took a step forward. “That doesn’t make it a maternity spell.”“When Cara used her Agiel on Nicci,” Kahlan said, “it dropped me to my kneesjust the same as if Cara had used the Agiel on me.”Ann and Alessandra shared a silent look.“But . . . but, if she were to . . .” Ann stammered.Kahlan voiced what Ann was trying to say without saying it. “If she were todesire it, Nicci could snip that cord of magic, and I would die. That was themeans by which she captured Richard. She promised I would live if Richard wentwith her. Richard surrendered himself into slavery to save my life.”“It can’t be,” Ann said, touching mitten-covered fingers to her chin. “Nicciwouldn’t know how to use such an unusual spell-she’s too young. Besides, such arare spell requires great power. She must have done something else and just saidthat it was a maternity spell. Nicci couldn’t do a maternity spell.”“Yes, she could,” Sister Alessandra said in reluctant disagreement. “She has thepower and ability. It would only have required someone with the specializedknowledge teaching her. Nicci doesn’t have any great passion for magic, but sheis as able as they come.”“Lidmila . . .” Ann whispered to Alessandra in sudden realization. “Jagang hasLidmila. “Kahlan turned a suspicious glare on Sister Alessandra. “And how do you know somuch more about Nicci’s ability than the Prelate herself?”Sister Alessandra gathered her open cloak back together. Her face lost itswarmth and reverted to a scowl-this time, though, with bitterness in the set ofher mouth.“I brought Nicci in to the Palace of the Prophets when she was but a child. Iwas responsible for her upbringing, and I guided her training in the use of hergift; I know her better than anyone. I know her darker powers because I, too,was a Sister of the Dark. I’m the one who brought her to the Keeper.”Kahlan could feel herself rocking with the force of her hammering heart. “So,you, too, are a Sister of the Dark.”“Was,” Ann said, lifting a cautionary hand before Kahlan.“The Prelate came into Jagang’s camp and rescued me. Not just from Jagang, butfrom the Keeper, too. I once again serve the Light.” The incandescent smileagain transformed Alessandra’s face. “Ann brought me back to the Creator.”As far as Kahlan was concerned, the claim was not worth the effort ofconfirmation. “How did you find us?”Ann ignored the terse question. “We must hurry. We must get Richard away fromNicci before she delivers him to Jagang.”Kahlan kept her glare on Alessandra while she answered Ann. “She isn’t takinghim to Jagang. She said she isn’t acting on behalf of His Excellency, but onbehalf of herself. Those were her words. She said she had removed Jagang’s ringfrom her lip and that she wasn’t afraid of him.”“Did she say why, then, she was taking Richard?” Ann asked. “Or, at least,where?”Kahlan moved her scrutiny back to Ann. “She said she was taking him intooblivion.”“Oblivion!” Ann gasped.“I asked you a question,” Kahlan said, anger seeping into her voice. “How didyou find us?”Ann tapped her waist. “I have a journey book. I used it to communicate withVerna, back with our forces. Verna told me about the messengers coming to seeyou. That’s how I knew where to find you. Lucky I came as soon as I did; wenearly missed you. I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you have recovered,Kahlan. We were so worried.”Kahlan saw that Cara, standing behind the two women, still had her Agielclenched in her fist. Kahlan didn’t need an Agiel; her Confessor’s power boiledbut an impulse away. She wouldn’t again make an error for the sake of caution.“The journey book. Of course. Then Verna would have told you about Richard’svision that he must not lead our troops against the Order.”Ann nodded reluctantly, apparently not eager to discuss such a vision. “Then, afew days ago, Verna sent a message when we were almost here, that the D’Haransare in quite a state because they suddenly lost their sense of direction toRichard. She said they are still protected from the dream walker by the bond totheir Lord Rahl, but they suddenly lost their sense of where he is.”“Nicci cloaked his bond from us,” Cara said in a growl.“Well, we have to find him,” Ann said. “We have to get him away from Nicci. He’sour only chance. Whatever he’s thinking, it’s nonsense and we will have to sethim straight, but first we must get him back. He has to lead our forces againstthe Imperial Order. He is the one named in prophecy.”“That’s why you’re here,” Kahlan whispered to herself. “You heard from Vernaabout his declining to lead the army or even to give orders. You journeyed herein hopes of forcing him to fight.”“He must,” Ann insisted.“He must not,” Kahlan said. “He has come to realize that if he leads us intobattle, we will lose the cause of liberty for generations to come. He said hecame to realize that people don’t yet understand freedom and won’t fight forit.”“He must simply prove himself to the people.” Ann’s scowl reddened. “He mustprove himself their leader, which he has already begun to do, and they willfollow him.”“Richard says that he has come to understand that it is not he who must provehimself to the people, but the people who must now prove themselves to him.”Ann blinked in astonishment. “Why, that’s nonsense.”“Is it?”“Of course it is. The boy was named in prophecy centuries ago. I’ve been waitinghundreds of years for him to be born in order for him to lead us in thisstruggle.”“Really. Then who are you to try to countermand Richard’s decision-if you are soset on following him? He has come to his decision. If he is the leader you want,then you must abide by his lead, and therefore his decision.”“But this is not what prophecy demands!”“Richard doesn’t believe in prophecy. He believes we make our own destiny. I’mcoming to see the grounds of his assertion that the belief in prophecyartificially alters events. It is the misplaced faith in prophecy itself-in somemystical outcome-that harms people’s lives.”Ann’s eyes grew round with dismay, and then narrowed. “Richard is the one namedin prophecy to lead us against the Imperial Order. This is a struggle for thevery existence of magic in this world-don’t you understand that! Richard wasborn to fight this fight. We have to get him back!”“This is all your fault,” Kahlan whispered.“What?” Ann’s frown changed to a tolerant smile. “Kahlan, what are you talkingabout?” Her voice backslid to genial. “You know me, you know our struggle forthe survival of freedom of magic. If Richard does not lead us, we have nochance.”Kahlan threw her arm out and seized a startled Sister Alessandra by the throat.The woman’s eyes went wide.“Don’t move,” Kahlan said through gritted teeth, “or I will unleash myConfessor’s power.”Ann held her hands up, imploring. “Kahlan, have you lost your mind? Let her be.Calm down.”With her other hand, Kahlan pointed down at the fire. “The journey book. Throwit in the fire.”“What? I’m not going to do any such thing!”“Now,” Kahlan said through her clenched teeth. “Or Sister Alessandra will bemine. When I finish with her, Cara will see to it you throw that journey book inthe fire, if you have to do so with broken fingers.”Ann glanced at the Mord-Sith towering over her shoulder.“Kahlan, I know you’re upset, and I completely understand, but we’re on the sameside in this. We love Richard, too. We, too, wish to stop the Imperial Orderfrom taking the whole world. We-”“We? If it wasn’t for you and your Sisters, none of this would be happening.This is all your fault. Not Jagang’s fault, not the Imperial Order’s fault, butyours.”“Have you lost your-”“You alone bear responsibility for what is befalling the world. Just as Jaganghas his ring through the lip of his slaves, you’ve had yours through the nose ofyours-Richard! You alone bear responsibility for the lives already lost, andthose yet to be lost in bloody slaughters that will sweep across the land. You,not Jagang, are the one who has brought it!”Despite the cold, beads of sweat dotted Ann’s brow. “What in the name ofCreation are you talking about? Kahlan, you know me. I was at your wedding. Ihave always been on your side. I have only followed the prophecies to helppeople.”“You create the prophecies! Without your help they would not have come to pass!They only come about because you have fulfilled them! You pull the ring throughRichard’s nose!”Ann presented a face of calm to the stone of Kahlan’s rage.“Kahlan, I can only imagine how you must feel, but now you are truly losing allsense of reason.”“Am I? Am I, Prelate? Why does Sister Nicci have my husband? Answer me. Why!”Ann’s expression drew tight in a darkening glower. “Because she is evil.”“No.” Kahlan’s grip tightened on Alessandra’s throat. “It’s because of you. Hadyou not sent Verna into the New World in the first place, ordering her to takeRichard back across the barrier into the Old World-”“But the prophecies say the Order will rise up to take the world and extinguishmagic if we fail to stop them! The prophecies say Richard is the only one tolead us! That Richard is the only one with a chance!”“And you brought that dead prophecy to life. All by yourself. All because ofyour faith in bloodless words rather than your own reasoned choices. You’re heretoday not to back the choices of your proclaimed leader, not to reason with him.but to enforce prophecy upon him-to give that ring a tug. Had you not sent Vernato recover Richard, what would have happened, Prelate?”“Why, why, the Order-”“The Order? The Order would still be trapped back in the Old World, behind thebarrier. Wouldn’t they! For three thousand years that wizard-created barrier hasstood invincible against the pressure of the Order-or those like them-and theirwish to swarm up here into the New World, bent on conquest.“Because you had Richard captured, against his will, and ordered him broughtback to the Old World, all in slavish homage to dead words in dusty old books,he was forced to destroy the barrier, and thus the Order now can flood into theNew World, into the Midlands, my Midlands, slaughtering my people, taking myhusband, all because of you and your meddling!“Without you, none of this would be happening! No war, no mounds of butcheredpeople in cities of the New World, no thousands of dead men, women, and childrenslaughtered at the hands of Imperial Order thugs-none of it!“Because of you and your precious prophecies, the veil was breached and a plaguewas unleashed on the world. It would never have happened without your actions to‘save’ us all from prophecy. I don’t even dare to recall all the children I sawsuffering and dying from the black death because of you. Children who looked upinto my eyes and asked if they would be all right, and I had to say yes when Iknew they would not survive the night.“No one will ever know the tally of the dead. No one is left to remember all thesmall places wiped out of existence by that plague. Without your meddling, thosechildren would be alive, their mothers would be smiling to themselves as theywatched them play, their fathers would be teaching them the ways of the world-aworld denied them by you for the sake of your faith in prophecy!“You say this is a battle for the very existence of magic in this world-yet yourwork to fulfill prophecy may have already doomed magic. Without yourintervention, the chimes would never have come to be loosed upon the world. Yes,Richard managed to banish them, but what irreversible harm was done? We may haveour power back, bent during the time the chimes withdrew magic from this world,creatures of magic, things dependent on magic for their very existence, surelydied out. Magic requires balance to exist. The balance of magic in this worldwas disturbed. The irrevocable destruction of magic may have already begun. Allbecause of your slavish service to prophecy.“If not for you, Prelate, Jagang, the Imperial Order’s army, and all yourSisters would be back there, behind the barrier, and we would be here, safe andat peace. You cast blame everywhere but where it belongs. If freedom, if magic,if the world itself is destroyed, it will all be by your hand, Prelate.”The low moan of the wind was the only sound and made the sudden silence all thatmuch more agonizing. Ann stared with tear-filled eyes up at Kahlan. Snowsparkled in the rays of a cold dawn.“It isn’t like that, Kahlan. It only seems that way to you in your pain.”“It is that way,” Kahlan said with finality.Ann’s mouth worked, but this time no words came out.Kahlan thrust out her hand, palm up.“The journey book. If you think I would not destroy this woman’s life, then youdon’t know the first thing about me. She’s one of your Sisters, helping todestroy the world in the name of good, or else she is still one of the Keeper’sSisters, helping to destroy the world in the name of death. Either way, if youdon’t give me the journey book, and right now, her life is forfeit.”“What do you think this will accomplish?” Ann whispered in despair.“It will be a start at halting your meddling in the lives of the people of theMidlands, and the rest of the New World-in my life, in Richard’s life. It’s theonly beginning I can think to make, short of killing you both; you would notlike to know how close I am to that alternative. Now, give me the journey book.”Ann stared down at Kahlan’s hand open before her. She blinked at her tears.Finally, she pulled off a woolen mitten and worked the little book out frombehind her belt. She paused a moment, reverently gazing at it, but in the endlaid it on Kahlan’s palm.“Dear Creator,” Ann whispered, “forgive this poor hurting child of yours forwhat she is about to do.”Kahlan tossed the book in the fire.With ashen faces, Ann and Sister Alessandra stood staring at the book in thehissing flames.Kahlan snatched up Richard’s sword. “Cara, let’s get going.”“The horses are ready. I was saddling them when these two showed up.”Kahlan dumped the hot water to the side while Cara started quickly collectingtheir belongings. They both stuffed items in the saddlebags. Other gear theyslung over their shoulders and carried to the horses to be strapped back on thesaddles.Without looking back at Ann or Alessandra, Kahlan swung up into her cold saddle.With a grim Cara at her side, she turned her mount and cantered off into theswirling snow."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 28As soon as she saw Kahlan and Cara vanish like vengeful spirits into thewhiteness, Ann fell to her knees and thrust her hands into the fire to snatchthe burning journey book from its funeral pyre in the white-hot coals.“Prelate!” Alessandra cried. “You’ll burn yourself!”Flinching back from the ferocity of the pain, Ann ignored the gagging stench ofburning flesh and thrust her hands again into the wavering heat of the fire. Shesaw, rather than felt, that she had the priceless journey book in her fingers.The entire rescue of the burning book took only a second, but, through the prismof pain, it seemed an eternity.Biting down on her lower lip against the suffering, Ann rolled to the side.Alessandra came running back with her hands full of snow. She threw it on Ann’sbloody blackened fingers and the journey book clenched in them.She let out a low wail of agony when the wet snow contacted the burns.Alessandra fell to Ann’s side, taking her hands by the wrists, gasping in tearsof fright.“Prelate! Oh, Prelate, you shouldn’t have!”Ann was in a state of shock from the pain. Alessandra’s shrill voice seemed adistant drone.“Oh, Ann! Why didn’t you use magic, or even a stick!”Ann was surprised by the question. In her panic over the priceless journey bookburning there in the fire, her mind was filled only with the single thought toget it out before it was too late. Her reckless action, she knew, wasprecipitated by her bitter anguish over Kahlan’s accusations.“Hold still,” Alessandra admonished through her own tears. “Hold still and letme see what I can do about healing you. It will be all right. Just hold still.”Ann sat on the snowy ground, dazed by the hurt, and by the words still hammeringher from inside her head, as she let Alessandra work at healing her hands.The Sister could not heal her heart.“She was wrong,” Alessandra said, as if reading Ann’s thoughts. “She was wrong,Prelate.”“Was she?” Ann asked in a numb voice after the searing pain in her fingersfinally began to ease, replaced by the achingly uncomfortable tingling of magiccoursing into her flesh, doing its work. “Was she, Alessandra?”“Yes. She doesn’t know so much as she thinks. She’s a child-she couldn’t be apaltry three decades yet. People can’t learn to wipe their own noses in thatmuch time.” Alessandra was prattling, Ann knew, prattling with her worry overthe journey book, and with her worry over the anguish caused by Kahlan’s words.“She’s just a foolish child who doesn’t know the first thing about anything.There’s much more to it. Much more. It isn’t so simple as she thinks. Not sosimple at all.”Ann wasn’t so sure anymore. Everything seemed dead to her. Five hundred years ofwork-had it all been a mad task, driven on by selfish desires and a fool’sfaith? Wouldn’t she, in Kahlan’s place, have seen it the same way?Endless rows of corpses lay before her in the trial going on in her mind. Whatwas there to say in her defense? She had a thousand answers for the MotherConfessor’s charges, but at that moment, they all seemed empty. How could Annpossibly excuse herself to the dead?“You’re the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light,” Alessandra rambled on during apause in her work. “She should have been more considerate of who she was talkingto. More respectful. She doesn’t know everything involved. There’s a great dealmore to it. A great deal. After all, the Sisters of the Light don’t casuallychoose their Prelate.”Nor did Confessors casually choose their Mother Confessor.An hour passed, and then another, before Alessandra finally finished thedifficult and tedious work of healing Ann’s burns. Burns were difficult injuriesto heal. It was a tiring experience, being helpless and cold while magic sizzledthrough her, while Kahlan’s words sliced her very soul.Ann flexed the aching fingers when Alessandra had finished. A shadow of theburning pain lingered, as she knew it would for a good long time. But they werehealed, and she had her hands back.When the matter was weighed, though, she feared she had lost a great deal moreof herself than she had recovered.Exhausted and cold, Ann, to Alessandra’s worry, lay down beside the hissingremnants of the fire that had so hurt her. At that moment, she had no desire toever rise again. Her years, nearly a thousand of them, seemed to have all caughtup with her at once.She missed Nathan terribly right then. The prophet doubtless would have hadsomething wise, or foolish, to say. Either would have comforted her. Nathanalways had something to say. She missed his boastful voice, his kind, childlike,knowing eyes. She missed the touch of his hand.Weeping silently, Ann cried herself to sleep. Her dreams kept the sleep frombeing either restful, or deep. She awoke in late morning to the feel ofAlessandra’s comforting hand on her shoulder. The Sister had added more wood tothe fire, so it offered warmth.“Are you feeling better, Prelate?”Ann nodded her lie. Her first thought was for the journey book. She gazed at itlying in the protection of Alessandra’s lap. Ann sat up and carefully lifted theblackened book from the sling of Alessandra’s dress.“Prelate, I’m so worried for you.”With a sour wave of her hand, Ann dismissed the concern.“While you slept, I’ve looked at the book.”Ann grunted. “Looks bad.”Alessandra nodded. “That’s what I thought. I don’t think it can be salvaged.”Ann used an easy, gentle flow of her Han to hold the pages-little more thanash-together as she carefully turned them.“It has endured three thousand years. Were it ordinary paper, it would be beyondhelp-ended-but this is a thing of magic, Alessandra, forged in the fires ofmagic, by wizards of power not seen in all those three thousand years . . .until Richard.”“What can we do? Do you know a way to restore it?”Ann shook her head as she inspected the curled, charred journey book. “I don’tknow if it can be restored. I’m just saying that it’s a thing of magic. Wherethere is magic, there is hope.”Ann pulled a handkerchief from a pocket deep under the layers of her clothes.Laying the blackened book in the center of the handkerchief, she carefullyfolded the handkerchief up to hold it together. She wove a spell around it allto protect and preserve it for the time being.“I will have to try to find a way to restore it-if I can. If it can even berestored.”Alessandra dry-washed her hands. “Until then, our eyes with the army are lost.”Ann nodded. “We won’t know if the Imperial Order decides to finally leave theirplace in the south and move up into the Midlands. l can give no guidance toVerna.”“Prelate, what do you think will happen if the Order finally decides toattackand Richard isn’t there with them? What will they do? Without the LordRahl to lead them . . .”Ann did her best to move the terrible weight of Kahlan’s words to the side asshe considered the immediate situation.“Verna is the Prelate now-at least as far as the Sisters with the army areconcerned. She will guide them wisely. And Zedd is with them, helping theSisters prepare for battle, should it come. They could have no better counselthan to have a wizard of Zedd’s experience with them. As First Wizard, he hasbeen through great wars before.“We will have to place our faith in the Creator that He will watch over them. Ican’t advise them unless I can restore the journey book. Unless I can do that, Iwon’t even know their situation.”“You could go there, Prelate.”Ann brushed snow from the side of her shoulder, where she had been lying on theground, as she considered that possibility.“The Sisters of the Light think I’m dead. They’ve put their faith in Verna, now,as their Prelate. It would be a terrible thing to do to Verna-and to the rest ofthe Sisters-to come back to life in the middle of such trying circumstances.Certainly many would be relieved to have me back, but it also sows the seeds ofconfusion and doubt. Battle is a very bad time for such seeds to sprout.”“But they would all be encouraged by your-”Ann shook her head. “Verna is their leader. Such a thing could forever underminetheir trust in her authority. They must not lose their faith in her leadership.I must put the welfare of the Sisters of the Light above all else. I must keeptheir best interests at heart, now.”“But, Ann, you are the Prelate.”Ann stared off. “What good has that done anyone?”Alessandra’s eyes turned down. The wind moaned sorrowfully through the trees.Gusts kicked up blue-gray trailers of snow and whipped them along through thecampsite. The sunlight had vanished behind somber clouds. Ann wiped her nose onthe edge of her icy cloak.Alessandra laid a compassionate hand on Ann’s arm. “You brought me back from theKeeper, back into the Light of the Creator. I was in Jagang’s hands, and treatedyou terribly when they captured you, yet you never gave up on me. Who else wouldhave cared? Without you, my soul would be lost for all time. I doubt you couldfathom my gratitude for what you did, Prelate.”Despite Alessandra’s apparent return to the Creator’s Light, Ann had been fooledby the woman before. Years before, Alessandra had turned to the Keeper, becominga Sister of the Dark, and Ann had never known. How could one have faith in aperson after such a betrayal?Ann looked up into Alessandra’s eyes. “I hope so, Sister. I pray such is reallytrue.”“It is, Prelate.”Ann lifted a hand toward the shrouded sun. “And perhaps when I go to theCreator’s Light in the next world, that one good act will erase the thousands oflives lost because of me?”Alessandra looked away, rubbing her arms through the layers of clothes. Sheturned and put two sticks of wood on the fire.“We should have a hot meal. That will make you feel better, Prelate. It willmake us both feel better.”Ann sat on the ground watching Alessandra prepare her hearty camp soup. Anndoubted that even the pleasant aroma of soup would arouse her appetite.“Why do you think Nicci took Richard?” Alessandra asked as she put driedmushrooms from a pouch into the soup.Ann looked up at Alessandra’s puzzled face. “I can’t imagine, except to thinkthat she may be lying, and she is taking him to Jagang.”Alessandra broke up dried meat and dropped it into the boiling pot of soup.“Why? If she had him, and he was forced to do as she asked-why lie? What wouldbe the purpose?”“She’s a Sister devoted to the Keeper.” Ann lifted her hands and let them flopback into her lap. “That’s excuse enough to lie, isn’t it? Lying is wrong. It’swicked. That’s reason enough.”Alessandra shook her head in admonition. “Prelate, I was a Sister of the Dark.Remember? I know better. That isn’t the way it is at all. Do you always tell thetruth just because you are devoted to the Creator’s Light? No; one lies for theKeeper just as you would lie for the Creator-to His ends, if lying is necessary.Why would Nicci lie about that? She was in control of the situation and had noneed to lie.”“I can’t imagine.” Ann had difficulty caring enough to consider the question.Her mind was in a morass of hopeless thoughts. It was her fault Richard was inthe hands of the enemy, not Nicci’s.“I think she did it for herself.”Ann looked up. “What do you mean?”“I think Nicci is still looking for something.”“Looking for something? What ever do you mean?”With a finger, Alessandra brushed a measure of spices into the pot from a waxedpaper she’d unfolded. “Ever since the first day I took her from her home andbrought her to the Palace of the Prophets, Nicci continually grew more . . .detached, somehow. She always did whatever she could to help people, but she wasalways a child who made me feel as if I was inadequate at fulfilling her needs.”“Such as?”Alessandra shook her head. “I don’t know. She always seemed to me to be lookingfor something. I thought she needed to find the Light of the Creator. I pushedher mercilessly, hoping it would open her eyes to His way and fill her innerneed. I allowed her no room to think about anything else. I even kept her awayfrom her family. Her father was a selfish lover of money and her mother . . .well, her mother was well intentioned, but always made me feel uncomfortable. Ithought the Creator would fill that private void within Nicci.” Alessandrahesitated. “And then I thought it was the Keeper she needed.”“So, you think she took Richard to fill some . . . inner need? How does thatmake sense?”“I don’t know.” Alessandra breathed out heavily in frustration. She stirred thesoup as she drizzled in a pinch of salt. “Prelate, I think I failed Nicci.”“In what way?”“I don’t know. Perhaps I failed to involve her adequately in the needs ofothersgave her too much time to think of herself. She always seemed devoted tothe welfare of her fellow man, but maybe I should have rubbed her nose in otherpeople’s troubles more, to teach her the Creator’s way of virtue through caringmore for her fellow man rather than her own selfish wants.”“Sister, I hardly think that could be it. Once she asked me for an extravagantblack dress to wear to her mother’s funeral, and of course I refused such aprofligacy because it was unfitting for a novice needing to learn to put othersfirst, but other than that one time, I never knew Nicci to once ask for anythingfor herself. You did an admirable job with her, Alessandra.”Ann recalled that, after that, Nicci started wearing black dresses.“I remember that.” Alessandra didn’t look up. “When her father died, I went withher to his funeral. I always felt sorry for taking her away from her family, butI explained to her that she was so talented that she had great potential forhelping others and must not waste it.”“It’s always hard to bring young ones to the palace. It’s difficult to part achild from loving parents. Some adapt better than others.”“She told me she understood. Nicci was always good that way. She never objectedto anything, any duty. Perhaps I assumed too much because she always threwherself into helping others, never once complaining.“At her father’s funeral, I wanted to help her over her grief. Even though shehad that same cool exterior she always had, I knew her, I knew she was hurtinginside. I tried to comfort her by telling her not to remember her father likethat, but to try to remember him as he was when he was alive.”“Those are kind words to one in such grief, Sister. You offered wise advise.”Alessandra glanced up. “She was not comforted, Prelate. She looked at me withthose blue eyes of hers-you remember her blue eyes.”Ann nodded. “I remember.”“Well, she looked at me with those piercing blue eyes, like she wanted to hateme, but even that emotion was beyond her, and she said in that lifeless voice ofhers that she couldn’t remember him as he was when he was alive, because she hadnever known him when he was alive. Isn’t that the strangest thing you’ve everheard?”Ann sighed. “It sounds like Nicci. She always was one to say the strangestthings at the strangest times. I should have offered her more guidance in herlife. I should have taken more interest in her . . . but there were so manymatters needing my attention.”“No, Prelate, that was my job. I tailed in it. Somehow, I failed Nicci.”Ann pulled her cloak righter against a bitter gust of wind. She took the bowl ofsoup when Alessandra handed it to her.“Worse, Prelate, I brought her to the shadow of the Keeper.”Ann looked over the rim of the bowl as she took a sip. She carefully set thesteaming bowl in her lap.“What’s done is done, Alessandra.”While Alessandra sipped at her soup, Ann’s mind wandered to Kahlan’s words. Theywere words spoken in anger, and as such, were to be forgiven. Or were they to beconsidered in an honest light?Ann feared to say Kahlan’s words were wrong; she feared they were true. Forcenturies Ann had worked with Nathan and the prophecies, trying to avoid thedisasters she saw, and the ones he pointed out to her. What if Nathan had beenpointing out things that were only dead words, as Kahlan said? What if he onlypointed them out so as to bring about his own escape?After all, what Ann had set in motion with Richard had also resulted in theprophet’s escape. What if she had been duped into being the one to bring aboutall those terrible results?Could that be true? Grief threatened to overwhelm her.She was beginning to greatly fear that she had been so absorbed in what shethought she knew that she had acted on false assumptions.Kahlan could be right. The Prelate of the Sisters of the Light might bepersonally responsible for more suffering than any monster born into the worldhad ever brought about.“Alessandra,” Ann said in a soft voice after she finished her bowl of soup, “wemust go and try to find Nathan. It’s dangerous for the prophet to be out there,in the world that is defenseless against him.”“Where would we look?”Ann shook her head in dismay at the enormity of the task. “A man like Nathandoes not go unnoticed in the world. I must believe that if we set our minds toit, we could find him.”Alessandra watched Ann’s face. “Well, as you say, it is dangerous for theprophet to be loose in the world.”“It is indeed. We must find him.”“It took Verna twenty years to find Richard.”“So it did. But part of that was by my design. I hid facts from Verna. Thenagain, Nathan is no doubt hiding facts from us. Nonetheless, we have aresponsibility. Verna is with the Sisters, and with the army; they will do whatthey can in that capacity. We must go after Nathan. That part of it is up tous.”Alessandra set her bowl aside. “Prelate, I understand why you believe theprophet must be found, but, just as you feel you must find him, I feel I mustfind Nicci. I’m responsible for bringing her to the Keeper of the underworld. Imay be the only one who can bring her back to the Light. I have a uniqueunderstanding of that journey of the heart. I fear what will happen to Richardif I don’t try to stop Nicci.“Worse,” Alessandra added, “I fear what will happen to the world if Richarddies. Kahlan is wrong. I believe in what you’ve worked for all these years.Kahlan is making a complex thing sound simple because her heart is broken, butwithout what you did, she would never even have met Richard.”Ann considered Alessandra’s words. The seduction of acquittal was undeniable.“But, Alessandra, we don’t have the slightest idea where they went. Nicci is assmart as they come. If, as she says, she is acting on her own behalf, she willbe clever about not being found. How would you even go about such a search?“Nathan is a prophet loose in the world. You remember the trouble he’s caused inthe past. He could, by himself, bring about such calamity as the world has neverseen. Nathan boasts when he’s around people; he will surely leave such traceswhere he goes. With Nathan, I believe we at least have a chance of success. Buthunting for Nicci . . .”Alessandra met Ann’s gaze with grim resolution. “Prelate, if Richard dies, whatchance have the rest of us?”Ann looked away. What if Alessandra was right? What if Kahlan was right? She hadto catch Nathan; it was the only way to find out.“Alessandra . . .”“You don’t completely trust me, do you, Prelate?”Ann met the other woman’s eyes, this time with authority. “No, Alessandra, Iadmit that I don’t. How can I? You deceived me. You lied to me. You turned yourback on the Creator and gave yourself to the Keeper of the underworld.”“But I’ve come back to the Light, Prelate.”“Have you? Would not one acting for the Keeper lie for him, as you yourself onlymoments ago suggested?”Alessandra’s eyes filled with tears. “That’s why I must try to find Nicci,Prelate. I must prove that your faith in me was not misplaced. I need to do thisto prove myself to you.”“Or, you need to help Nicci, and the Keeper?”“I know I’m not worthy of trust. I know that. You said we must find Nathan-butwe must also help Richard.”“Two tasks of the utmost importance,” Ann said, “and no journey book to call forhelp.”Alessandra wiped at her eyes. “Please, Prelate, let me help. I’m responsible forNicci going to the Keeper. Let me try to make amends. Let me try to bring herback. I know what the return journey is like. I can help her. Please, let me tryto save her eternal soul?”Ann’s gaze sank to the ground. Who was she to question the value of another?What had her life been for? Had she herself been the Keeper’s best ally?Ann cleared her throat. “Sister Alessandra, you are to listen to me and you areto listen well. I am the Prelate of the Sisters of the Light and it is your dutyto do as I command.” Ann shook a finger at the woman. “I’ll have no arguments,do you hear? I must go find the prophet before he does something beyond foolish.“Richard is of utmost importance to our cause-you know that. I’m getting old andwould only slow the search for him and his captor. I want you to go after him.No arguments, now. You are to find Richard Rahl, and put the fear of the Creatorback into our wayward Sister Nicci.”Alessandra threw her arms around Ann, sobbing her thanks. Ann patted theSister’s back, feeling miserable about losing a companion, and afraid that shemight have lost her faith in everything for which she stood.Alessandra pushed away. “Prelate, will you be able to travel alone? Are you sureyou’re up to this?”“Bah. I may be old, but I’m not useless. Who do you think came into the centerof Jagang’s army and rescued you, child?”Alessandra smiled through her tears. “You did, Prelate, all by yourself. No onebut you could have done such a thing. I hope I can do half as well for Nicci,when I find her.”“You will, Sister. You will. May the Creator cradle you in His palm as you go onyour journey.”Ann knew that they were both going off on difficult journeys that could takeyears.“Hard times lie ahead,” Alessandra said. “But the Creator has two hands, does Henot? One for me, and one for you, Prelate.”Ann couldn’t help but smile at such a mental picture."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 29“Come in,” Zedd grouched to the persistent throat-clearing outside his tent.He poured water from the ewer into the dented metal pot that served as hiswashbasin sitting atop a log round. When he splashed some of the water up ontohis face, he gasped aloud. He was astonished that water that cold would stillpour.“Good morning, Zedd.”Still gasping, Zedd swiped the frigid water from his eyes. He squinted atWarren. “Good morning, my boy.”Warren blushed. Zedd reminded himself he probably shouldn’t call someone twicehis own age “boy.” It was Warren’s own fault; if the boy would just stop lookingso young! Zedd sighed as he bent to forage for a towel among the litter of maps,dirty plates, rusty dividers, empty mugs, blankets, chicken bones, rope, an egghe’d lost in the middle of a lesson weeks back, and other paraphernalia thatseemed to collect over time in the corner of his small field tent.Warren was twisting his purple robes into a small wad at his hip. “I just camefrom Verna’s tent.”Zedd halted his search and looked back over his shoulder.“Any word?”Warren shook his head of curly blond hair. “Sorry, Zedd.”“Well,” Zedd scoffed, “that doesn’t mean anything. That old woman has more livesthan a cat I once had that was hit by lightning and fell down a well, both inthe same day. Did I ever tell you about that cat, my boy?”“Well, yes, you did, actually.” Warren smiled. “But if you like, I wouldn’t mindhearing it again.”Zedd dismissed the story with a feeble wave as he turned more serious. “I’m sureAnn is fine. Verna knows Ann better than I do, but I do know that that old womanis downright hard to harm.”“Verna said something like that.” Warren smiled to himself. “Ann always couldscowl a thunderstorm back over the horizon.”Zedd grunted his agreement as he went back to digging through his pile. “Tougherthan bad meat, she is.” He tossed two outdated maps over his shoulder.Warren leaned down a little. “What is it you’re looking for, if you don’t mindmy asking?”“My towel. I know I had-’“Right there,” Warren said.Zedd looked up. “What?”“Your towel.” Warren pointed again. “Right there on the back of the chair.”“Oh.” Zedd snatched up the wandering towel and dried his dry face. He scowled atWarren. “You have the eyes of a burglar.” He tossed the towel in the pile witheverything else, where it belonged.Warren’s grin returned. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”Zedd cocked his head. “Do you hear that?”Warren’s grin melted away as he joined Zedd in listening to the sounds outside.Horses clogged along the hard ground, men talked as they passed the tent, other:called orders, fires crackled, wagons squeaked, and gear clanged and rattled.“Hear what?”Zedd’s face twisted in vague unease. “I don’t know. Like, maybe a whistle.”Warren lifted a thumb over his shoulder. “The men whistle now and again, to getthe attention of their horses and such. Sometimes it’s necessary.”They all did their best to keep the whistling and other noise down. Whistles,especially, carried in such open terrain. It was hard to miss something the sizeof the D’Harans’ encampment, of course, so they moved camp from time to time tokeep the enemy from getting too confident about their location. Sound could giveaway more than they would like.Zedd shook his head. “Must have been that. Someone’s long whistle.”“But still, Zedd,” Warren went on, “it’s long past time when Ann would have sentVerna a message.”“There were times when I was with Ann that she couldn’t send messages.” Zeddwaved an arm expansively. “Bags, there was a time when I wouldn’t let her usethat confounded journey book. The thing gave me the shivers. I don’t know whyshe couldn’t just send letters, like normal people.” His face, he knew, wasbetraying his concern. “Confounded journey books. Lazy way of doing things. Igot to be First Wizard and I never needed a journey book.”“She could have lost it. That’s what Verna suggested, anyway.”Zedd held up a finger. “That’s right. She very well could have. It’s small-itcould have fallen from her belt and she didn’t nonce until she and Alessandramade camp. She’d never find the book in a circumstance like that.” He shook thefinger. “Makes my point, too. You shouldn’t depend on little trick things ofmagic, like that. It just makes you lazy.”“That’s what Verna thought, too. About it falling from her belt, I mean.” Warrenchuckled. “Or a cat could even have eaten it.”From beneath a furrowed brow, Zedd peered at Warren. “A cat? What cat?”“Any cat.” Warren cleared his throat. “I just meant . . . oh, never mind. Inever was any good at jokes.”Zedd’s knotted brow lifted. “Oh, I see. A cat could have eaten it. Yes, yes, Isee.” He didn’t, but Zedd forced a chuckle for the boy’s sake. “Very good,Warren.”“Anyway, she probably lost it. It’s probably something as simple as that.”“If that’s the case,” Zedd reasoned, “she will likely end up coming here to letus know that she’s all right, or at least she will send a letter, or messenger,or something. Ever more likely, though, she probably had nothing to tell us andsimply saw no need to bother with sending a message in her journey book.”Warren made a skeptical face. “But we haven’t had a message from her for nearlya month.”Zedd waved a hand dismissively. “Well, she was way north, up almost to whereRichard and Kahlan are, last we heard. If she did lose the book and startedright out to come here from there, she won’t show up for yet another week ortwo. If she went on to see Richard first, then it will be longer, I imagine. Anndoesn’t travel all that fast, you know.”“I know,” Warren said. “She is getting up there in years. But that’s justanother reason why I’m so worried.”What really worried Zedd was the way the journey book went silent just as Annwas about to reach Richard and Kahlan. Zedd had been eagerly anticipatinghearing that Richard and Kahlan were safe, that Kahlan was all healed. Maybeeven that Richard was ready to return. Ann knew how eager they were for word andwould certainly have had something to report. Zedd didn’t like the coincidencethat the journey book went silent right at that time. He didn’t like it one bit.The whole thing made him want to scratch as if he’d been bitten by a whitemosquito.“Now look here, Warren, a month isn’t so long not to hear from her. In the past,it’s sometimes been weeks and weeks between her messages. It’s too early tostart getting ourselves all worked up with worry. Besides, we have our ownconcerns which require our attention.”Zedd didn’t know what they could do even if Ann were in trouble somewhere. Theyhad no idea how to find her.Warren flashed an apologetic smile. “You’re right, Zedd.”Zedd moved a map and found a half loaf of bread left from the night before. Hetook a big bite, giving himself an excuse to chew instead of talk. When hetalked, he feared he only let out the true level of his worry not just aboutAnn, but also about Richard and Kahlan.Warren was an able wizard, and smarter than just about anyone Zedd had ever met.Zedd often had trouble finding something to talk about that Warren hadn’talready heard of, or was intimately familiar with. There was somethingrefreshing about sharing knowledge with someone who nodded knowingly at esotericpoints of magic that no one else would fathom, someone who could fill in littlegaps in the odd spell, or delighted at having his own little gaps filled in bywhat Zedd knew. Warren retained more about prophecy than Zedd thought anyone hada right to know in the first place.Warren was a fascinating mix of obstinate old man and callow youth. He was atonce set in his ways, and at the same time openly, infinitely, innocently,curious.The one thing that made Warren fall silent, though, was when they discussedRichard’s “vision.” Warren’s face would go blank and he would sit withoutcomment while others argued over what Richard had said in his letters and ifthere was any validity to it. Whenever Zedd had Warren alone and asked him whathe thought, Warren would say only “I follow Richard; he is my friend, and he isthe Lord Rahl.” Warren would not debate or discuss Richard’s instructions to thearmy-or, more specifically, Richard’s refusal to give instructions. Richard hadgiven his orders, as far as Warren was concerned, and they were to be swallowed,not chewed.Zedd noticed that Warren was twisting his robes again.Zedd waved his bread. “You look like a wizard with his pants full of itchingspells. Do you have something you need to let out, Warren?”Warren grinned sheepishly. “Am I that obvious?”Zedd patted the boy on the back. “No, Warren, I’m just that good.”Warren laughed at Zedd’s joke. Zedd gestured with his bread toward the foldingcanvas chair. Warren looked behind himself at the chair, but shook his head.Zedd figured it must be important, if Warren felt he needed to stand to say it.“Zedd, with winter upon us, do you believe the Imperial Order will attack, orwait until spring?”“Well, now, that’s always a worry. The not knowing leaves your stomach all inknots. But you’ve all worked hard. You’ve all trained and practiced. You’ll dojust fine, Warren. The Sisters, too.”Warren didn’t seem to be interested in hearing what Zedd was saying. He wasscratching his temple, waiting his turn to speak.“Yes, well, thank you, Zedd. We have been working hard.“Umm, General Leiden thinks winter is our best friend right now. He, his Keltishofficers, and some of the D’Harans believe that Jagang would be foolhardy tostart a campaign with winter just setting in. Kelton isn’t all that far north ofhere, so General Leiden is familiar with the difficulty of winter warfare in theterrain we would fall back to. He’s convinced the Order is waiting for spring.”“General Leiden in a good man, and may be second-in-command, after GeneralReibisch,” Zedd said in an even voice as he watched Warren’s blue eyes, “but, Idon’t agree with him.”Warren looked crestfallen. “Oh.”The general had brought his Keltish division down south a couple of monthsbefore to reinforce the D’Haran army, at General Reibisch’s request. RegardingKahlan as their queen, since Richard had named her so, the Keltish forces stillhad an independent streak, even if they were now part of the “D’Haran Empire,”as everyone had taken to calling it.Zedd didn’t do anything to discourage such talk; it was better for everyone inthe New World to be one mighty force than a collection of tribes. As far as Zeddwas concerned, Richard had clearly had the right instincts in that. A war ofthis scale would have been ungovernable were the New World not one. Havingeveryone think of themselves as part of the D’Haran Empire first and foremostcould only help make it so.Zedd cleared his throat. “But that’s just a guess, Warren. I could be wrong.General Leiden is an experienced man, and no fool. I could be wrong.”“But so could Leiden be wrong. I guess that puts you with General Reibisch. He’sbeen pacing his tent every night for the last two months.”Zedd shrugged. “Is there something important to you, Warren, that hinges on whatthe Imperial Order does? Are you waiting for them to make up your mind for youabout something?”Warren held up his hands as if to ward the very notion. “No-no, of course not.It’s just that . . . it’s just that it would be a bad time to be thinking aboutsuch things, is all .... But if they were going to lie low for the winter . . .”Warren fussed with his sleeve. “That’s all I meant .... If you thought they weregoing to wait until spring, or something . . .” His voice trailed off.“And if they were, then-?”Warren stared at the ground while he twisted his robes at his stomach into apurple knot. “If you think they might decide to move this winter, then itwouldn’t be right for me-for us-to be thinking about such things.”Zedd scratched his chin and changed his approach. “Let’s say I believe the Orderis going to sit tight for the winter. Then what might you do, in that case?”Warren threw his hands up. “Zedd will you marry Verna and me?”Zedd’s brow went up as he drew back his head. “Bags, my boy, that’s a mouthfulto swallow first thing in the morning.”Warren took two big strides closer. “Will you Zedd? I mean, only if you reallythink the Order is going to sit down there in Anderith for the winter. If theyare, then, well, then it would be, I mean, we might as well-”“Do you love Verna, Warren?”“Of course I do!”“And does Verna love you?”“Well, of course she does.”Zedd shrugged. “Then I’ll marry the both of you.”“You will? Oh, Zedd, that would be wonderful.” Warren turned, reaching one handtoward the tent’s opening, lifting his other back toward Zedd. “Wait. Wait therea moment.”“Well, I was about to flap my arms and fly to the moon, but if you want me towait-”Warren was already out the tent. Zedd heard muffled voices coming from outside.Warren came back in-right on Verna’s heels.Verna beamed from ear to ear, which Zedd found unsettling in its own way, beingso unusual.“Thank you for offering to marry us, Zedd. Thank you! Warren and I wanted you todo the ceremony. I told him you would do it, but Warren wanted to ask you andgive you a chance to say no. I can’t think of anything more meaningful thanbeing wedded by the First Wizard.”Zedd thought she was a lovely woman. A little fussy about rules and such, attimes, but well intentioned. She worked hard. She didn’t shy from some of thethings Zedd had asked of her. And, she obviously held Warren in warm regard, aswell as respecting him.“When?” Verna asked. “When do you think would be an appropriate time?”Zedd screwed up his face. “Do you two think you can wait until I’ve had a properbreakfast?”They both grinned.“We were thinking more along the lines of an evening wedding,” Verna said.“Maybe we could have a party, with music and dancing.”Warren gestured nonchalantly. “We were thinking something to make a pleasantbreak in all the training.”“A break? How much time do you two think you will be needing away from yourduties-”“Oh, no, Zedd!” Warren had gone as purple as his robes. “We didn’t mean wewould-I mean we would still be doing-we would only like-”“We don’t want any time away, Zedd,” Verna put in, bringing Warren’s bashfulbabbling to an end. “We just thought it would be a nice opportunity for everyoneto have a well-earned party for an evening. We won’t be leaving our posts.”Zedd put a bony arm around Verna’s shoulders. “You two can have all the timeaway you want. We all understand. I’m happy for you both.”“That’s great, Zedd,” Warren said with a sigh. “We really-”A red-faced officer burst into the tent without so much as announcing himself.“Wizard Zorander!”Two Sisters charged in right behind him.“Prelate!” Sister Philippa called.“They’re coming!” Sister Phoebe cried.Both women were white-faced and looked to be on the verge of losing theirbreakfast. Sister Phoebe was trembling like a wet dog in winter. Zedd then sawthat Sister Philippa’s hair was singed on one side and the shoulder of her dresswas blackened. She had been one of those on far watch for the enemy gifted.Now Zedd knew what the whistling sound he thought he’d heard was. It was verydistant screams.Rolling up from the distance came the note of the secondary waypoint alarmhorns. Zedd felt the faint tingle of magic woven through them, so he knew theywere genuine. Outside the tent, the muted sounds of camp life rose into a din ofactivity. Weapons were being yanked from where they were stacked, fires hissedas they were dowsed, swords were being strapped on, others were being drawn,horses whinnied at the sudden racket.Warren seized Sister Philippa’s arm and started issuing orders. “Get the linecoordinated. Don’t let them be seen-keep behind the third ridge. Set the tripsclose-we need to give the enemy confidence. Cavalry?”The woman nodded.“Coming in two wings,” the officer put in. “But they aren’t charging yet-theydon’t want to get out too far ahead of their foot soldiers.”“Start the first fire behind them-once they’re past the blast point just likewe’ve drilled,” Warren told Sister Philippa as she nodded heedfully to hisinstructions. The intention was to trap any cavalry charge between walls ofviolent magic. It had to be focused properly to have any hope of piercing theenemy’s shields.“Prelate,” Sister Phoebe said, still panting, “you can’t imagine the numbers.Dear Creator, it looks like the ground is moving, like the hills are melting mentoward us.”Verna put a comforting hand to the young Sister’s shoulder. “I know, Phoebe. Iknow. But we all know what to do.”Verna was already ushering the two Sisters out and calling for her other aides,as yet more officers and returning scouts leaped from horses.A big, bearded soldier, sweat running down his face, barged into the tentgasping for his breath.“The whole blasted force. All of ‘em.”“Cavalry with lances-enough to break their way and then some,” another manshouted into the tent from atop a lathered horse, pausing only long enough todeliver the news to Zedd before charging off.“Archers?” Zedd asked the two soldiers still in his tent.The officer with the beard shook his head. “Too far to tell.” He gulped air.“But I’d bet my life they’re right behind the pikemen’s shields.”“No doubt,” Zedd said. “When they get close enough, they’ll show themselves.”Warren grabbed the bearded officer’s sleeve and pulled him along behind as hetrotted out of the tent. “Don’t worry, when they show themselves we’ll havesomething to put out their eyes.”The other man ran on to his duties. In an instant, Zedd was standing alone inhis tent, lit from the outside by early-morning winter sun. It was a cold dawn.It would be a bloody day.Outside the tent, the racket exploded into the uproar of practiced pandemonium.Everyone had a job, and knew it well; these were mostly battle-tested D’Harans.Zedd had snuck close and had seen how fearsome the Imperial Order troops looked,but the D’Harans were their match in gristle. For generations, D’Harans pridedthemselves on being the fiercest fighters in existence. For a good part of hislife, Zedd had battled D’Harans who had proven their boasts true.Zedd could hear someone shouting, “Move, move, move.” It sounded like GeneralReibisch. Zedd dashed to the tent’s opening, pausing at the brink of a river ofmen flowing past in a great churning mass.General Reibisch skidded to a halt just outside the tent.“Zedd-we were right.”Zedd nodded his disappointment to have surmised the enemy’s plans. This was onetime he wished he’d been wrong.“We’re breaking camp,” General Reibisch said. “We’ve not much time. I’ve alreadyordered the advance guard to shift their positions north to cover the supplywagons.”“Is it all of them-or just a jab to test us?”“It’s the whole bloody lot.”“Dear spirits,” Zedd whispered. At least he had made what plans for thiseventuality as could be made. He had trained the gifted to expect this so theywouldn’t be thrown off balance. It would come just as Zedd told them it would;that would aid their confidence and give them courage. The day hinged on thegifted.General Reibisch swiped his meaty hand across his mouth and jaw as he looked tothe south, toward an enemy he couldn’t yet see. The early sun made hisrustcolored hair look red, and the scar that ran from his left temple to his jawstand out like a streak of frozen white lightning.“Our sentries pulled back along with the outer lines. No use in them standingground, since it’s the whole Imperial Order.”Zedd quickly nodded his agreement. “We’ll be the magic against magic for you,General.”The man had a lusty glint in his grayish-green eye. “We’re the steel for you,Zedd. We’ll show them bastards a lot of both today.”“Just don’t show them too much, too soon,” Zedd warned.“I’m not about to change our plans now,” he said over the sound of the tumult.“Good.” Zedd snatched the arm of a soldier running past. “You! I need your help.Pack up my things in there for me, would you, lad? I need to get to theSisters.”General Reibisch gestured the young soldier into Zedd’s tent, and the young manleaped to the task.“The scouts said they’re all staying on this side of the Drun River, just as wehoped.”“Good. We won’t have to worry about them flanking us, at least not from thewest.” Zedd swept his gaze over the dissolving camp as the men swiftly set abouttheir jobs. He looked back to the general’s weathered face. “Just get our mennorth into those valleys in time, General, so that we can’t be surrounded. Thegifted will cover your tails.”“We’ll plug up the valleys, don’t you worry.”“The river isn’t frozen over, yet, is it?”General Reibisch shook his head. “Maybe enough for a rat to skate on, but notthe wolf that’s after him.”“That should keep them from crossing.” Zedd squinted off to the south. “I haveto go check on Adie and her Sisters. May the good spirits be with you, General.They won’t need to watch your back-we’ll do that.”General Reibisch caught Zedd’s arm. “There’s more than we thought, Zedd. Twicethe number at least. If my scouts weren’t just stuttering, there may be threetimes the number. Think you can slow that many down while keeping them focusedon trying to sink their teeth into my backside?”The plan was to draw the enemy north while staying just out of theirreach--close enough to make them salivate but not close enough to let them get agood bite. Crossing the river at this time of year would be impractical for anarmy that size. With the river on one side, and mountains on the other, a forcethe size of the Imperial Order couldn’t so easily surround and overwhelm the“D’Haran Empire” troops, who were outnumbered ten or twenty to one.The plan, too, was designed to keep in mind Richard’s admonition about notattacking directly into the Order. Zedd wasn’t sure about the validity ofRichard’s warning, but knew better than to so openly tempt ruin.Hopefully, once they enticed the enemy into that tighter terrain, terrain moredefensible, the Order would lose some of their advantage and their advance couldbe halted. Once the Imperial Order was stalled, the D’Harans could begin workingthe enemy down to size. The D’Harans thought nothing of being outnumbered; itjust gave them a better opportunity to prove themselves.Zedd stared off, imagining the hillsides darkened with the enemy pouring forth.He was already seeing the lethal powers he would unleash.He knew, too, that in battle things rarely went as planned.“Don’t you worry, General, today the Imperial Order is going to begin paying aterrible price for its aggression.”The grinning general clapped Zedd on the side of the shoulder. “Good man.”General Reibisch charged off, calling for his aides and his horse, collecting agrowing crowd of men around him as he went.It had begun."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 30Arms resting on his thighs, Richard crouched in the belly of the beast.“Well?” Nicci asked from atop her horse.Richard stood beside a rib bone that towered to well over twice his height. Heshielded his eyes against the golden sunlight as he briefly scanned the emptyhorizon behind himself. He looked back at Nicci, her hair honeyed by the lowsun.“I’d say it was a dragon.”When her mare began to dance sideways, trying to put distance between itself andthe expanse of bones, Nicci took the slack out of the reins.“Dragon,” she repeated in a flat voice.Here and there dried scraps of meat stuck to the bones. Richard swished a handat the cloud of flies buzzing around him. The faint stench of decay hung overthe site. As he stepped out of the cage of giant rib bones standing belly-up, hegestured toward the head, nestled in a bed of brown grass. There was enough roomto walk between the ribs without them touching his shoulders.“I recognize the teeth. I had a dragon’s tooth, once.”Nicci looked skeptical. “Well, whatever it is, if you’ve seen enough, let’s beon our way.”Richard brushed his hands clean. The stallion snorted and stepped away from himwhen he approached. The horse didn’t like the smell of death, and didn’t trustRichard after having been near it. Richard stroked the glossy black neck.“Steady, Boy,” he said in a comforting voice. “Easy now.”When she saw Richard finally mount up, Nicci turned her dappled mare and startedoff once more. The late-afternoon light cast long, clawed shadows of the ribbones toward him, as if reaching out, calling him back to the ghost of someterrible end. He glanced back over his shoulder at the length of the skeletalremains, stretched out in the middle of an empty, gently rolling grassland,before urging his stallion into a trot to catch up with Nicci. His horse neededlittle encouragement to be away from the dying place, and happily sprang intohis easy loping gallop, instead.In the month or so Richard had spent with the horse, the two of them had becomeused to each other. The horse was willing enough, but never really friendly.Richard wasn’t interested enough to go to the effort of doing more; makingfriends with a horse was just about the last of his concerns. Nicci hadn’t knownif the horses had names, and didn’t. seem interested in naming animals, soRichard simply called the black stallion “Boy,” and Nicci’s dappled gray mare“Girl,” and left it at that. Nicci seemed neither pleased or displeased abouthim naming the horses; she simply went along with his convention.“Do you actually believe it’s the remains of a dragon?” Nicci asked when hecaught up with her.The stallion slowed and, glad to be back in the herd, gave the mare’s flanks anuzzle. Girl merely turned her closest ear toward him in recognition.“It’s about the right size, as I remember.”Nicci tossed her head to flick her hair back over her shoulder. “You’re serious,aren’t you?”Richard frowned his puzzlement. “You saw it. What else could it possibly be?”She conceded with a sigh. “I just thought it was the bones of some long-extinctbeast.”“With flies still buzzing around it? It still had a few bits of sinew dried tothe bones. It’s not some ancient thing. It couldn’t be much older than sixmonthspossibly much less.”She was watching him from the corner of her eye, again. “So, they really do havedragons in the New World?”“In the Midlands, anyway. Where I grew up there were none. Dragons, as Iunderstand it, have magic. There was no magic in Westland. When I came here I .. . saw a red dragon. From what I heard, they’re very rare.”And now there was at least one less.Nicci was little concerned about the remains of an animal, even if it was adragon. Richard had long ago decided that, as much as he lusted to crush herskull, he would have a better chance of figuring a way out of his situation ifhe didn’t antagonize her. Battling another person sapped your own strength,making it more difficult to reason your way out of the trouble. He kept his mindfocused on what was most important to him.He couldn’t force himself to pretend to befriend Nicci, but he tried to give herno cause to become angry enough to hurt Kahlan. So far, it had been successful.Nicci didn’t seem easily inclined to anger, anyway. When she became displeased,she submerged back into an indifference which seemed to smother her distantrancor.They finally reached the road from where they had spotted the white speck thathad turned out to be the remains of the dragon.“What was it like growing up in a place with no magic?”Richard shrugged. “I don’t know. That’s just the way it was. It was normal.”“And you were happy? Growing up without magic, I mean?”“Yes. Very happy.” The frown returned to his face. “Why?”“And yet, you fight to keep magic in the world, so other children will have togrow up with it. Am I right?”“Yes.”“The Order wishes to rid the world of magic, so that people can grow up happy,without the poisonous fog of magic always outside their door.” She glanced overat him. “They want children to grow up much like you did. And yet you fightthis.”It was not a question, so Richard chose not to turn it into one for her. Whatthe Order chose to do was not his concern. He turned his thoughts to otherthings.They were traveling east-southeast on a road traversed by the odd trader. Theyhad smiled and nodded at two that day. The road, as it took the easiest routeacross the rolling hills, had that afternoon begun to turn more to the south. Asthey crested a rise, Richard spotted a flock of sheep in the far distance. Notfar ahead, they had been told, was a town where they could pick up some neededprovisions. The horses could use some grain, too.Over his left shoulder, to the northeast, snow capped mountains turning pink inthe late sunlight rose up out of the foothills. To his right, the ground rolledoff into the wilds. Beyond the town, it wouldn’t be too far until they crossedthe Kern River. They were not far at all from what used to be the wastelandwhere the great barrier had stood.They were close to cutting south into the Old World.Even though there was no longer a barrier to prevent his return once theycrossed over, he felt downhearted about leaving the New World. It was likeleaving Kahlan’s world. Like leaving her by one more degree. As fiercely as heloved her, he could feel her slipping farther and farther into the distance.Nicci’s blond hair fluttered in the breeze as she turned toward him. “It’s saidthey used to have dragons in the Old World, too.”Richard brought himself out of his brooding.“But no more?” he asked. She shook her head. “How long ago was that?”“Long ago. No one living has ever seen one-and that includes Sisters living atthe palace.”He thought about it as he rode, listening to the rhythmic clop of hooves. Niccihad proven forthcoming, so he asked, “Do you know why not?”“I can only tell you what was taught to me, if you would like to hear it.” WhenRichard nodded, she went on. “During the great war, at the time when the barrierbetween the Old and New Worlds was raised, the wizards in the Old World workedtoward revoking magic from the world. Dragons could not exist without magic, sothey went extinct.”“But they still existed here.”“On the other side of the barrier. It may be that the old wizards’ suppressionof magic, on their side, had only a local, or even temporary, effect. After all,magic still exists, so obviously they failed to achieve their ends.”Richard was getting an uneasy feeling as he considered both Nicci’s words andthe bones he had seen.“Nicci, may I ask you a question, a serious question, about magic?”She gazed over at him as she slowed her horse to an easy walk. “What is it youwish to know?”“How long do you think a dragon could exist without magic?”Nicci considered his question for a moment, but in the end let out a sigh. “Ionly know about the history of the dragons in the Old World as it was taught. Asyou know, words written that long ago are not always dependable. It would onlybe an educated guess. I would say it could be mere moments, possibly days-oreven longer, but not a great deal longer. It’s a much simplified version ofasking how long a fish could live out of water. Why do you ask?”Richard raked his fingers back through his hair. “When the chimes were here, inthis world, they drew away magic. All of the magic, or nearly all, anyway, waswithdrawn from the world of life for a time.”She turned her eyes back to the road. “My estimation is that the withdrawal wastotal, for a time, at least.”That was what he had feared. Richard considered her words along with what heknew. “Not all creatures of magic depend on it. Us, for example; we are, in away, creatures of magic, but we can live without it, too. I’m wondering ifcreatures that depended on magic for their very existence might not have made itthrough until the chimes were banished and magic was restored to the world oflife.”“Magic was not restored.”Richard pulled his horse up short. “What?”“Not in the way you are thinking about it.” Nicci circled around to face him.“Richard, while I have no direct knowledge with precisely what happened, such anevent could not be without consequence.”“Tell me what you know.”She frowned in curiosity. “Why do you look so concerned?”“Nicci, please, just tell me what you know?”She folded her wrists over the horn of her saddle.“Richard, magic is a complex matter, so there can be no certainty.” She held upa hand to forestall his cascade of questions. “This much, though, is certain.The world doesn’t stay the same. It changes continuously.“Magic is not merely part of this world. Magic is the conduit between worlds. Doyou understand?”He thought he might. “I accidentally used magic to call forth the spirit of myfather from the underworld. I banished him back to the underworld with the useof magic. The Mud People, for example, use magic to communicate with theirspirit ancestors beyond the veil in the underworld. I had to go to the Temple ofthe Winds, in another world, when Jagang sent a Sister there to start a plaguewhich she brought back from that world.”“And what do all of those things have in common?”“They used magic to bridge the gap between worlds.”“Yes. But there is more. Those worlds exist, but they are dependent on this oneto define them, are they not?”“You mean, like life is created into this world, and after death, souls aretaken by the Keeper to the underworld?”“Yes. But more, do you see the connection?”Richard was getting lost. He hadn’t grown up knowing anything about magic.“We’re caught between the two realms?”“No, not exactly.” Her blue eyes flashed with intensity. She waited until hisgaze steadied on hers, then she held up a finger to mark the importance of herwords.“Magic is a conduit between worlds. As magic diminishes, those other worlds arenot just more distant to us, but the power of those worlds, in this world,diminishes. Do you see?”Richard was getting goose bumps. “You mean, the other worlds have lessinfluence, like . . . like a child who has grown and his parents have lessinfluence over him. ““Yes.” In the fading light her eyes seemed more blue than usual. “As the worldsgrow more separate, it is something like a child growing and leaving home. Butthere is more to it, yet.”She leaned forward ever so slightly in her saddle. “You see, those other worldscan be said to exist only by their relationship to life-to this world.” At thatmoment, she seemed like nothing to him so much as what she really was: aonehundred-and-eighty-year-old sorceress. “It might even be said,” she whisperedin a voice that sounded like the shadows speaking, “that without magic to linkthose other worlds to this, those other worlds cease to exist.”Richard swallowed. “You mean, just as the child grows and leaves home, theparents become less important to his existence. When they eventually grow oldand die, even though they were once vital and strongly linked to him, when theynow cease to exist, he lives on without them.”“Exactly,” she hissed.“The world changes,” he said almost to himself. “The world doesn’t stay thesame. That’s what Jagang wants. He wants magic, and those other worlds, to ceaseto exist so that he will have this one all for himself.”“No,” she said in a soft voice. “He wishes it not for himself, but for mankind.”Richard started to argue, but she cut him off. “I know Jagang. I’m telling youwhat he believes. He may enjoy the spoils, but in his heart, he believes he isdoing this for mankind, not himself.”Richard didn’t really believe her, but he didn’t see any point in quarrelingwith her. Either way, because of the changes taking place, such creatures asdragons might have already become extinct. Those white bones could very wellhave been the remains of the last red dragon.“Because of events like the chimes, the world may already have irrevocablychanged to a point where creatures of magic have died out,” she said as shestared out over the empty twilight. “In an evolving world such as I describe,magic, even such as ours, would soon die out, too. Do you see, now? Without thatconduit to other worlds, worlds that may no longer exist, magic would not comeinto existence when offspring of the gifted are born.”One thing was sure: when the time came, he was going to make Nicci extinct.As they rode on, Richard gazed back over his shoulder at bones he could nolonger see.It was well after dark when they rode into the town. When Richard inquired of apasserby, he was told that the town, Ripply, was named after the ripplingfoothills. It was a quiet place, off in a nearly forgotten corner of theMidlands, its back to what used to be the wasteland from where no one everreturned. Many of the people grew wheat and raised sheep to provide themselveswith trade goods, while keeping small animals and gardens for themselves.There was a road coming in from the southwest, from Renwold, and other roadsgoing off to the north. Ripply was a crossroads for trade between Renwold, thepeople of the wilds who traded at that outpost city, and villages to the northand east. Now, of course, Renwold was gone; the Imperial Order had sacked thecity. Now, with only ghosts inhabiting the streets of Renwold, the people of thewilds who traded their goods there would suffer. The people from the towns andvillages who came to Ripply would suffer, too; Ripply was falling on hard times.Richard and Nicci created a small sensation. Strangers traveling through hadbecome a sporadic event, what with Renwold gone. The two of them were tired, andthere was an inn, but raucous drinking was going on there, and Richard didn’twant to have to deal with that kind of trouble. There was a well-kept stable atthe other end of town from the inn, and the man who owned it offered to let themstay in the hayloft for a silver penny each. The night was cold, and it would bewarmer in the hayloft out of the wind, so Richard paid the man the penny eachfor themselves, and three more for the horses to be cared for and fed. Thetaciturn stable owner was so pleased with the extra penny for the horses that hetold Richard he would tend their shoes while he had them.When Richard thanked him and told him they were tired, the man smiled for thefirst time and said, “I’ll be seeing to your horses, then. I hope you and yourwife sleep well. Good night, then.”Richard followed Nicci up the rough wooden ladder at the back of the barn. Theyhad a cold dinner sitting in the hay as they listened to the stable ownerfetching grain and water for their horses. Richard and Nicci had only the barebones of necessary conversation before they rolled themselves up in their cloaksand went to sleep. When they woke a little after dawn, they discovered a smallgathering of skinny children and hollow-cheeked adults, come to see the “rich”folks traveling through. Apparently, their horses, better than any that hadboarded at the stable in a long time, had been the source of gossip andspeculation.When Richard greeted the people, he got back only vacant looks. When he andNicci walked to the supply store, not far away past a few drab buildings, thepeople all followed, as if it were a king and queen come to town, and they allwanted to see what such highborn people did with their day. Goats and chickenswandering Ripply’s main street scattered before the procession. A milk cowcropping brown grass behind the leather shop paused for a look. A rooster atop astump flapped his wings in annoyance.When the bolder children asked who they were, Nicci told them that they wereonly travelers, husband and wife, looking for work. Such news was greeted withskeptical tittering. In her fine black dress, the people took Nicci for a queenlooking for a kingdom. They thought only a little less of Richard.When an older boy asked where they were going to look for work, as there waslittle to be found in Ripply, Nicci told them that they were going to the OldWorld. Some of the adults snatched up children and hurried away. Yet moreremained close on Richard and Nicci’s heels.An older man who owned the supply store gently shooed the people away from hisdoor when Richard went in. Once Richard had gone inside, he watched the peoplegrow bolder and begin pawing at Nicci, begging for money, for medicine, forfood. Nicci stayed outside with the people, asking them about their troubles andtheir needs. She moved through the crowd, inspecting the children. She had thatblank look on her face that Richard didn’t like.“What can I get you,” the proprietor asked.“Ah, what about those people?” Richard asked instead.He glanced out the sparkling-clean little window to see Nicci standing in themiddle of the ragged group, talking about the Creator’s love for them. They alllistened as if she were a good spirit come to comfort them.“Well, they’re all sorts,” the shop owner said. “Most wandered in from the OldWorld after the barrier came down. Some are just no-good locals-drunks andsuch-who’d just as soon beg or steal as work. When strangers from the Old Worldcame in, some of the people here joined their ways. We get traders through here,and men like that, with goods to protect, find they have less trouble if they’regenerous with that sort. Some of them out there are folks who’ve hadtrouble-widows with children who can’t find a husband; things like that. A fewof them will work for me, when I have work, but most won’t.”Richard was about to give the man a list of their needs, when Nicci glided inthe door.“Richard, I need some money.”Rather than argue with her, he passed her the saddlebag with the money. Shereached in and pulled out a handful of gold and silver. The shop owner’s eyeswent wide when he saw how much she had in her fist. She paid him no heed.Richard stood slack jawed as he watched Nicci, back out with the crowd, givingaway all the money. Arms waved and reached for her. People cried out all thelouder. A few ran off with what she had given them.Richard pulled open the saddlebag, peering in to see how much they had left. Itwasn’t much. He could hardly believe what Nicci had just done. It made no sense.“How about some barley flour, some oatmeal, some rice, some bacon, lentils,dried biscuits, and salt?” he asked the waiting proprietor.“No oatmeal, but I’ve got the rest. How much do you want?”Richard was running calculations through his head. They had a long journey, andNicci had just given away most of their money. They’d used up the better portionof the supplies they had.He laid six silver pennies on the counter. “Just what that will buy us.” Hepulled his pack off his back and set it on the counter beside the money.The man scooped up the coins and sighed at the money he had almost made. Hebegan pulling the items down from a shelf and placing them in the pack. As heworked, Richard requested a few other small things he remembered as the man wasgoing about getting the order. He parted with another penny.Richard had only a few silver pennies, two silver crowns, and no gold left.Nicci had handed out more money than most of those people had ever seen in theirentire lifetimes. Worried about what they were going to do for supplies in thefuture, Richard slung his pack onto his back when the shop proprietor hadfinished, and rushed out to see if he couldn’t slow Nicci down.She was lecturing on the Creator’s love of every man and asking the people toforgive the cruelty of heartless and uncaring people, as she handed the lastgold coin to an unshaven man without teeth. He grinned his thanks and thenlicked his parched lips. Richard knew how he would wet them. There were yet morepleading hands thrusting toward her.Worried, Richard seized Nicci’s arm and pulled her back. She turned toward him.“We have to get back to the stables,” she said.“That’s what I’m thinking,” Richard said, holding his anger in check. “Let’shope the stableman is done with them by now so we can get out of here.”“No,” she said with a look of grim finality in her eye. “We need to sell thehorses.”“What?” Richard blinked in angry astonishment. “May I at least ask why?”“To share what we have with those who have nothing.”Richard was beyond words. He just stared at her. How were they going to travel?He considered the question briefly, and decided that he didn’t really care howsoon they got to wherever it was she was taking him. But they would have tocarry everything. He was a woods guide, and used to walking with a pack, so heguessed he could walk. He let out his breath and turned toward the stables.“We need to sell the horses,” Richard told the stable owner.The man frowned, looked at the horses standing in their stalls, and then back atRichard. He looked thunderstruck.“Those are mighty fine horses, mister. We don’t have horses like this aroundhere.”“You do now,” Nicci said.He glanced uneasily at her. Most people were uneasy gazing at Nicci, eitherbecause of her startling beauty, or because of her cool, often denunciative,presence.“I can’t pay what horses like this are worth.”“We didn’t ask you to,” Nicci said in a dull voice. “We only asked to sell themto you. We need to sell them. We’ll take what you can give us.”The man’s eyes shifted from Richard’s to Nicci’s and back. Richard could tellthe man was uneasy about cheating them in such a way, but he couldn’t seem tofigure out how to turn down such an offer.“All I can pay is four silver marks for the both of them.”Richard knew they were worth ten times that much.“And the tack,” Nicci said.The man scratched his cheek. “I guess I could throw in another silver, butthat’s all I got to my name. I’m sorry, I know they’re worth more, but if you’rebound and determined for me to buy them off you, that’s all I got.”“Is there anyone else in town who might buy them for more?” Richard asked.“I don’t believe so, but to tell you the truth, son, it wouldn’t be hurting myfeelings if you were to go ask around. I don’t like swindling folks, and I knowyou couldn’t call five silver marks for the horses and tack anything else but aswindle.”The man kept glancing at Nicci, seeming to suspect that this transaction wasbeyond Richard’s ability to control. Her steady blue eyes could make any manfidget.“We accept your offer,” Nicci said without any hesitation or uncertainty. “I’msure it’s quite fair.”The man sighed unhappily at his windfall. “I don’t have that much money on me.I’ll go in the house”-he lifted a thumb over his shoulder-”out back of the barnand get it, if you’d be so good as to wait a minute.”Nicci nodded and he hurried on his way, not so much eager to consummate thedeal, Richard thought, as he was eager to be out from under Nicci’s gaze.Richard turned to her, feeling his face heating. “What’s this all about?” He sawthrough the partly open stable doors that the crowd of people who had followedthem were still out there.She ignored his question. “Get your things-whatever you can carry. As soon as hecomes back, it’s time we were on our way.”Richard pulled his glare from her. He stalked over to his gear, sitting outsideBoy’s stall, and began stuffing everything he could into his pack. He strappedthe waterskins around his waist and flipped the saddlebags over his shoulders.He was sure the stable owner wouldn’t complain about not having the saddlebagswith the rest of the tack. Richard thought that when they reached a moreprosperous town, he could at least sell the saddlebags. While he worked, Nicciput her belongings into a pack she could carry.When the man came back with the money, he offered it to Richard. Nicci held outher hand.“I’ll take it,” she said.He glanced to Richard’s eyes once and then handed Nicci the money. “I threw inthe silver pennies you paid me last night. That’s all I have, I swear.”“Thank you,” Nicci said. “That was very generous of you to share what you have.That is the Creator’s way.”Without another word, Nicci turned and strode through the dimly lit stable andout the door.“It’s my way,” the man muttered under his breath to her back. “Creator had nosay in it.”Outside in the sunlight, Nicci began doling out the money she had just gottenfor the horses. The people vied for her favor as she walked among them, speakingto them, asking questions, until she was out of sight, past the edge of the barndoor.Richard gave Boy a quick rub on the blaze of his forehead, hoisted hissaddlebags onto his shoulder, and turned to the dumbfounded expression on thestable owner’s face. He and Richard shared a helpless look.“I hope she’s a good wife to you,” the man finally said.Richard wanted to say that Nicci was a Sister of the Dark, and that he was herprisoner, but in the end he decided that it could serve no purpose. Nicci hadmade it clear to him that he was Richard Cypher, her husband, and she was NicciCypher, his wife. She had told him to stick to that story-for Kahlan’s sake.“She’s just generous,” Richard said. “That’s why I married her. She’s good topeople.”Richard heard a woman’s cry, and shouting. He bolted for the partly open doorand ran out into the bright morning sunlight. He didn’t see anyone. He racedaround to the side of the barn, to where he heard scuffling.A half dozen men had Nicci down on the ground, some swinging at her with theirfists as she tried to fend them off with her bare hands. Others pawed at her,searching for a money pouch. They were fighting over the unearned before it waseven out of her hands. A crowd of women, children, and other men stood aroundthe scene in a circle, vultures waiting to pick the bones.Richard crashed through the ring of people, seized the closest man by the backof his collar, and heaved him back. He was skinny, and flew through the air,crashing into the wall of the barn. The whole building shook. Richard kickedanother in the ribs, tumbling him off Nicci and through the dirt. A third manspun and took a mighty swing at Richard. Richard caught the fist and bent itdown until he felt a snap as the man cried out. At that, the men all scatteredin every direction.Richard started after one of them, but Nicci suddenly flew at him, restraininghim.“Richard! No!”In his rage to get at the men, Richard nearly smashed her face, but, when herealized it was her, lowered his fists to his sides as he glared at the crowd.“Please,, my lord, please, my lady;” one of the women wailed, “have mercy on uswoeful folk. We’s just the Creator’s miserable wretches. Have mercy on us.”“You’re a bunch of thieves!” Richard yelled. “Thieving from someone who wastrying to help you!”He made an effort to go after the lot of them, but Nicci held his wrists down.“Richard, no!”The people vanished like mice before a hissing cat.Nicci let Richard’s fists drop. He saw then that she had blood on her mouth.“What’s the matter with you? Giving money to people who would rather rob youthan wait for you to hand it to them willingly? Why would you give money to suchvermin?”“That’s enough. I’ll not stand here and listen to you insult the Creator’schildren. Who are you to judge? Who are you, with a full belly, to say what’sright? You have no idea what those poor people have been through, and yet youare quick to judge.”Richard took a purging breath. He reminded himself yet again of what he had tokeep uppermost in his mind. It was not really Nicci he had been protecting.He pulled a shirtsleeve from the corner of his pack, wet it with water from awaterskin hanging around his waist, and carefully wiped her bloody mouth andchin. She winced as he worked but without protest let him inspect her injury.“It’s not bad,” he told her. “Just a cut in the corner of your mouth. Holdstill, now.”She stood quietly as he held her head in one hand while he cleaned the blood offthe rest of her face with the other.“Thank you, Richard.” She hesitated. “I was sure one of them was going to cut mythroat.”“Why didn’t you use your Han to protect yourself?”“Have you forgotten? To do that, I would have to take power from the linkkeeping Kahlan alive.”He looked into her blue eyes. “I guess I forgot. In that case, thank you forrestraining yourself.”Nicci said nothing as they walked out of the town of Ripply, carrying everythingthey owned on their backs. As cold as the day was, it wasn’t long before hisbrow was dotted with sweat.Finally he could stand it no longer. “Do you mind telling me what that was allabout?”Her brow twitched. “Those people were needy.”Richard pinched the bridge of his nose, pausing in an effort to remain civil toher. “And so you gave them all our money?”“Are you so selfish that you would not share what you have? Are you so selfishthat you would ask the hungry to starve, the unclothed to freeze, the sick todie? Does money mean more to you than people’s lives?”Richard bit the inside of his cheek to check his temper. “And the horses? Youvirtually gave them away.”“It was all we could get. Those people were in need. Under the circumstances, itwas the best we could do. We acted with the most noble of intentions. It was ourduty to not be selfish and to joyfully give these people what they needed.”There was no road going their way as they walked on into what had not long agobeen the wasteland from which no one returned.-“We needed what we had,” he said.Nicci glanced up into his eyes. “There are things you need to learn, Richard.”“Is that right.”“You have been lucky in life. You have had opportunities ordinary people neverhave. I want you to see how ordinary people must live, how they must strugglejust to survive. When you live like them, you will understand why the Order isso necessary, why the Order is the only hope for mankind.“When we get to where we’re going, we will have nothing. We will be just likeall the other miserable people of this wretched world-with little chance to makeit on our own. You don’t have any idea what that’s like. I want you to learn howthe compassion of the Order helps ordinary people live with the dignity they areentitled to.”Richard returned his gaze to the empty land stretching out before them. A Sisterof the Dark who couldn’t use her power, and a wizard who was forbidden fromusing his. He guessed they couldn’t get any more ordinary than that. “I thoughtit was you who wanted to learn,” he said. “I am also your teacher. Teacherssometimes learn more than their students.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 31Zedd lifted his head when he heard the distant horns. He struggled to regain hissenses. He was well past dread, into a world of little more than numb awareness.The horns were those meant to signal the approach of friendly forces. Probablysome of the scouting patrols, or perhaps yet more wounded being brought in.Zedd realized he was slumped on the ground, his legs sprawled out to the side.He saw that he had been sleeping with his head on the burly chest of a coldcorpse. In despair, he recalled that he had been trying everything he knew toheal the horribly wounded man. In mournful revulsion, he pushed away from thecold body and sat up.He rubbed his eyes against the darkness from within, as well as the night. Hewas beyond aching. Acrid smoke hung thick as fog. The air reeked with the heavy,throat-clenching stink of blood. From various places around him, he could seethe drifting haze illuminated around glowing orange fists of firelight. Themoans of the wounded lifted from the blood-soaked ground to drift through thefrigid night air. In the distance, men cried out in pain. When Zedd wiped a handacross his brow, he realized he wore gloves of crusted blood from those he hadbeen trying to heal. It was an endless task.Not far away, the ground was littered with shattered tree trunks, blastedasunder by the enemy gifted. Men lay sprawled, torn apart or impaled by hugesplintered sections of those trees. It had been two of Jagang’s Sisters who haddone it, just before dark, as the D’Haran forces were all collecting into thevalley, thinking the battle had ended. Zedd and Warren had ended it by takingthose two Sisters down with wizard’s fire.By the dull ache in his head, Zedd knew he hadn’t been asleep for more than acouple of hours, at most. It had to be the middle of the night. People passingby had let him sleep-or maybe they thought him one of the dead.The first day had gone as well as could be expected. The battle had dragged onsporadically throughout the first night with relatively minor skirmishes, andthen had erupted with full force at dawn of the second day. As night had fallenon the second day, the fighting had finally ended. Looking around, Zedd thoughtit seemed to be over-at least for the time being.They had made the valley and succeeded in drawing the Order after them, awayfrom other gateways up into the Midlands, but at a terrible price. They hadlittle choice, if they were to engage the enemy with any chance of success,rather than allow them unhindered access into the Midlands. For the moment,anyway, the Order was stalled. Zedd didn’t know how long that would last.Unfortunately, the Order had gotten the better of the battle, by far.Zedd peered about. It was not so much a camp as simply a place where everyonehad dropped in exhaustion. Here and there, arrows and spears stuck up from theground. They had fallen like rain as Zedd had worked throughout the night, thenight before, trying to heal wounded soldiers. During the day, in the battles,he had unleashed everything he had. What had started out as skillful,calculated, focused use of his ability had in the end degenerated into the magicequivalent of a brawl.Zedd staggered to his feet, worried about the distant thunder of horses. Hornscloser into camp repeated the warning to hold arrows and spears, that it wasfriendly forces. It sounded like too many horses for any patrol they had out. Inthe back of his mind, Zedd tried to recall if he felt the twinge of magic thatwould tell him the horns were genuine. In the fog of fatigue, he had forgottento pay attention. That was how people ended up dead, he knew-inattention to suchdetails.Men were rushing all about, carrying supplies, water, and linen for bandages, ormessages and reports: Here and there Zedd saw a Sister working at healing. Othermen struggled with repairs to wagons and gear in case they had to depart in ahurry. Some men sat staring at nothing. A few wandered as if in a daze.It was difficult to see in the poor light, but Zedd was able to see well enoughto tell that the ground was littered with the dead, the wounded, or the simplyspent. Fires, both the common orange and yellow flames of burning wagons and theunnatural green blazes that were the remnants of magic, were left to burn out ontheir own. Horses as well as men lay everywhere, still and lifeless, torn openby ghastly wounds. The battlefields changed, but battle didn’t. Now was a timeof helpless shock. He remembered from his youth the stench of blood and deathmingled with greasy smoke. It was still the same. He remembered in battles pastthinking the world had gone mad. It still felt the same.The rumble of horses was getting closer. He could hear quite a commotion, but hecouldn’t tell what sort of ruckus it was. Off to his right, he spotted a stoopedwoman shuffling toward him. He recognized Adie’s familiar limp. A woman moredistant, catching up to Adie from behind, was probably Verna. A little fartheroff, Zedd saw Captain Meiffert being lectured to by General Leiden. Both menturned to look toward the clatter of hooves.Zedd squinted into the murk and saw in the distance soldiers scattering before amass of approaching riders. Men waved their arms, as if in greeting. A fewoffered weak cheers. Many pointed in Zedd’s direction, funneling the horsemenhis way. As First Wizard, he had become a focal point for everyone. TheD’Harans, in Richard’s absence, relied on Zedd to be their magic against magic.The Sisters relied on his experience in the nasty art of magic in warfare.In the wavering glow of fires still burning out of control, Zedd watched thecolumn of horsemen coming relentlessly onward, points of light glinting off rowupon row of armor and weapons, shimmering off chain mail and polished boots, asthey each in turn passed the burning wagons and barricades. The thunderingcolumn slowed for nothing, expecting men to get out of its way. At their fore,long pennons flew atop perfectly upright lances. Standards and flags flapped inthe cold night air. The ground thundered with thousands of horses charging overthe blood-soaked ground. They rolled onward, like a ghost company riding out ofthe grave.Orange and green smoke, lit from behind by the eerie light of fires, curled awayto each side as the column of riders charged though the middle of the camp at aneasy gallop.Zedd saw, then, who was leading them.“Dear spirits . . .” he whispered aloud.Sitting tall atop a huge horse at the head of the column was a woman in leatherarmor with fur billowing out behind her like an angry pennant.It was Kahlan.Even at that distance, Zedd could see, sticking up behind her left shoulder, thegleam of light off the silver and gold hilt of the Sword of Truth.His flesh went cold with tingling dread.He felt a hand on his arm and turned to see Adie, her completely white eyestransfixed by the sight she beheld through her gift alone. Verna was stillweaving her way through the wounded. Captain Meiffert and General Leiden rushedto follow in Verna’s footsteps.The column stretched out behind Kahlan as far as Zedd could see. They chargedonward, collecting cheering men as they came. Zedd waved his arms as they allbore down on him, so that Kahlan would notice him, but it seemed as if she hadhad her eyes on him the whole time.The horses skidded to a halt before him, snorting and stamping, tossing theirarmored heads. Plumes of steam rose from their nostrils when they blew great hotbreaths in the icy air. Powerful muscles flexed beneath glossy hides as theypawed the ground. The eager beasts stood at the ready, their tails lashing sideto side, slapping their flanks like whips.Kahlan swept the scene with a careful gaze. Men were rushing up from alldirections. Those gathering around stared in wonder. The horsemen were Galeans.Kahlan had provisionally taken the place of her half sister, Cyrilla, as queenof Galea, until Cyrilla was well again-if that ever happened. Kahlan’s halfbrother, Harold, was the commander of the Galean army, and didn’t want thecrown, feeling himself more fit to serve his land in the soldier’s life. Kahlanhad Galean blood in her veins, although, to a Confessor, matters of blood wereirrelevant. They were not so irrelevant to Galeans.Kahlan swung her right leg forward over the horse’s neck and dropped to theground. Her boots resounded like a hammer strike announcing the MotherConfessor’s arrival. Cara, in her red leather, and similarly cloaked in a furmantle, likewise jumped down off her horse.Battle-weary men all around stood in rapt silence. This was not merely theMother Confessor. This was Lord Rahl’s wife.For just an instant, as Zedd stared into her green eyes, he thought she mightrun into his arms and break down in helpless tears. He was wrong.Kahlan pulled off her gloves. “Report.”She wore stealth-black light leather armor, a royal Galean sword at her lefthip, and a long knife at her right. Her thick fall of hair cascaded boldly overthe wolf’s fur mantle topping a black wool cloak. In the Midlands, the length ofa woman’s hair denoted rank and social standing. No Midlands woman wore hair aslong as Kahlan’s. But it was the hilt of the sword sticking up behind hershoulder that held Zedd’s gaze.“Kahlan,” he whispered as she stepped closer, “where’s Richard?”Whatever pain he had seen for that instant was gone. She swept a brief glareVerna’s way, as the young Prelate still hurried toward them between the wounded,then met Zedd’s gaze with eyes like green fire.“The enemy has him. Report.”“The enemy? What enemy?”Again her glare slid to Verna. Its power straightened Verna’s back and slowedher approach.Kahlan returned her attention to Zedd. Her eyes softened with a vestige ofsympathy for the anguish she must have seen on his face. “A Sister of the Darktook him, Zedd.” The respite of warmth in her voice and eyes faded as hercountenance returned to the cold, empty mask of a Confessor. “I would like areport, please.”“Took him? But is he-is he all right? You mean she took him as a prisoner? Dothey want ransom? He’s still all right?”She touched the side of her mouth and Zedd saw then that she. had a swollen cut.“He’s all right as far as I know.”“Well, what’s going on?” Zedd threw up his skinny arms. “What’s this about? Whatdoes she intend?”Verna finally made it up to Zedd’s left side. Captain Meiffert and GeneralLeiden ran up to the other side of Adie, on his right.“What Sister?” Verna asked, still getting her breath back. “You said a Sistertook him. What Sister?”“Nicci.”“Nicci. . .” Captain Meiffert gasped. “Death’s Mistress?”Kahlan met his gaze. “That’s the one. Now, is someone going to give me areport?”There was no mistaking the command, or the rage, in her voice. Captain Meiffertlifted an arm to the south.“Mother Confessor, the Imperial Order forces, all of them, finally moved up fromAnderith.” He rubbed his brow as he tried to think. “Yesterday morning, I guessit was.”“We wanted to pull them up here, into the valley country,” Zedd put in. “Ouridea was to get them out of the grassland, where we couldn’t contain them, upinto country where we had a better chance to do so.”“We knew,” Captain Meiffert went on, “that it would be a fatal mistake to letthem get by us and stream into the Midlands unopposed. We had to draw them intoaction to prevent them from unleashing their might against the populace. We hadto engage them and bog them down. The only way to do that was to taunt them intofollowing us out of the open, where they had the advantage, into terrain thathelped even the odds.”Kahlan nodded as she scanned the dismal scene. “How many men did we lose?”“I’d guess maybe fifteen thousand,” Captain Meiffert said. “But that’s just aguess. It may be more.”“They flanked you, didn’t they.” It didn’t sound like a question.“That’s right, Mother Confessor.”“What went wrong?”The Galean troops behind her formed a grim wall of leather, chain mail, andsteel. Officers with incisive eyes watched and listened.“What didn’t?” Zedd growled.“Somehow,” the captain explained, “they knew what we planned. Although, I guessit wouldn’t be all that hard to figure out, since anyone would know it was ouronly chance against their numbers. They were confident they could defeat us,regardless, so they obliged our plan.”“Like I asked, what went wrong?”“What went wrong!” General Leiden interrupted heatedly. “We were outnumberedbeyond all hope! That’s what went wrong!”Kahlan settled her cool gaze on the man. He seemed to catch himself and fell toone knee.“My queen,” he added in formal address before falling silent.Kahlan’s gaze lost some of its edge as it moved back to Captain Meiffert.Zedd noticed the captain’s fists tightening as he went on with his report.“Somehow, Mother Confessor, near as we can tell they managed to get a divisionacross the river. We’re pretty sure they didn’t use the open ground to theeast-we had preparations should they try that, as we feared they might.”“So,” Kahlan said, “they reasoned you would think it impossible, so they sent adivision across the river-probably a great deal more, willing to bear theirlosses in the crossing-went north through the mountains, unsuspected, unseen,and undetected, and crossed back to this side of the river. When you got here,they were waiting for you, holding the ground you had planned to hold. With theOrder hot on your heels, you had nowhere else to go. The Order intended to crushyou between that division holding this defendable ground and their army on yourtail.”“That’s the gist of it,” Captain Meiffert confirmed.“What happened to the division waiting here?” she asked.“We wiped them out,” the captain said with a cool rage of his own. “Once werealized what had happened, we knew it was our only chance.”Kahlan gave him a nod. She knew full well what a mighty effort his simple wordsconveyed.“They cut us to pieces from behind as we did so!” General Leiden’s temper wasgetting frayed around the edges. “We had no chance.”“Apparently you did,” she answered. “You gained the valley.”“What of it? We can’t fight a force their size. It was insane to throw men intothat meat grinder. What for? We gained this valley, but at a terrible price. Wewon’t be able to hold a force that huge! They had their way with us from thefirst until the last. We didn’t stop them, they just got tired of hacking us topieces for the night!”Some men looked away. Some stared at the ground. Only the crackle of fires andthe moans of the wounded filled the frigid night air.Kahlan glanced around again. “What are you doing sitting here, now?”Zedd’s brow went up, along with his own anger. “We’ve been at it for two days,Kahlan.”“Fine. But I don’t allow the enemy to go to bed with victory. Is that clear?”Captain Meiffert clapped a fist to his heart in salute. “Clear; MotherConfessor.”He glanced over his shoulders. Fists of attentive men near and far likewise wentto their hearts.“Mother Confessor,” General Leiden said, dropping her title of queen, “the menhave been up for two days, now.”“I understand,” Kahlan said. “We have been riding without pause for three days,now. Neither changes what must be done.”In the harsh reflection of firelight, the creases in General Leiden’s facelooked like angry gashes. He pressed his lips together and bowed to his queen,but when he came up, he spoke again.“My queen, Mother Confessor, you can’t seriously be expecting us to carry out anight attack. There’s no moon and clouds mostly hide the stars. In the dark suchan attack would be a disaster. It’s lunacy!”Kahlan finally withdrew her cold glare from the Keltish general and passed agaze among those assembled around her. “Where is General Reibisch?”Zedd swallowed. “I’m afraid that’s him.”She looked where Zedd pointed, at the corpse he had fallen asleep atop whiletrying to heal. The rust-colored beard was matted with dried blood. Thegrayishgreen eyes stared without seeing, no longer showing pain. It had been afool’s task, Zedd knew, but he couldn’t help trying to heal what could not behealed, giving it everything he had left. It hadn’t been enough.“Who is next in command,” Kahlan asked.“That would be me, my queen,” General Leiden said as he took a stride forward.“But as the ranking officer, I can’t allow my men to-”Kahlan lifted a hand. “That will be all, Lieutenant Leiden.”He cleared his throat. “General Leiden, my queen.”She fixed him with an implacable stare. “To question me once is a simplemistake, Lieutenant. Twice is treason. We execute traitors.”Cara’s Agiel spun up into her fist. “Step aside, Lieutenant.”Even in the haunting orange and green light of fires, Zedd could see the man’sface pale. He took a step back and wisely, if belatedly, fell silent.“Who is next in command?” the Mother Confessor asked again.“Kahlan,” Zedd said, “I’m afraid the Order used their gifted to single out menof rank. Despite our best efforts, I believe we lost all our senior officers. Itcost them dearly, at least.”“Then who is next in command?”Captain Meiffert looked around and finally lifted his hand.“I’m not positive, Mother Confessor, but I believe that would be me.”“Very well, General Meiffert.”He inclined his head. “Mother Confessor,” he said in a quiet, confidentialvoice, “that isn’t necessary.”“No one said it was, General.”The new general softly struck a fist to his heart. Zedd saw Cara smile in grimapproval. Of the thousands of faces watching, that was the only smile. It wasn’tthat the men disapproved, but rather that they were relieved to have someone sofirmly in command. D’Harans respected iron authority. If they couldn’t have LordRahl, they would take his wife, and an iron one at that. They might not havesmiled, but Zedd knew they would be pleased.“As I said, I don’t allow the enemy to go to bed with victory.” Kahlan scannedthe faces watching her. “I want a cavalry raid ready to go within the hour.”“And who do you intend to send on such an attack, my queen?”Everyone knew what the former General Leiden meant by the question. He wasasking who she was sending to their death.“There will be two wings. One to make their way unseen around the Order’s campso as to come in from their south, where they will least expect it, and anotherwing to hold back until the first is in place, and then come in from this side,from the north. I intend to have us spill some of their blood before bed.”She looked back to the new Lieutenant Leiden’s eyes and answered his question.“I will be leading the southern wing.”Everyone, except the new general, began voicing objections. Leiden spoke uplouder.“My queen, why would you want us to get our men together for a calvary raid?”He pointed to the wall of men, all on horses behind her: all Galeans-traditionaladversaries of the Keltans, Leiden’s homeland. “When we have these?”“These men will be helping get this army back together, relieving those on dutyto get needed rest, helping dig defensive ditches, and filling in wherever theyare needed. The men who were bloodied are the ones who need to go to bed withthe sweet taste of vengeance. I would not dare to deny D’Harans that to whichthey are so entitled.”A cheer went up.Zedd thought that if war was madness, madness had just found its mistress.General Meiffert took a step closer to her. “I’ll have my best men ready withinthe hour, Mother Confessor. Everyone will want to go; I’ll have to disappoint alot of volunteers.”Kahlan’s face softened when she nodded. “Pick your man for the northern wing,then, General.”“I will be leading the northern wing, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan smiled. “Very well.”She ordered the Galean troops off to their duties. With a sweep of her finger,she dismissed everyone but the immediate group and called that inner circlecloser.“What about Richard’s admonition not to directly attack the Order?” Verna asked.“I remember well what Richard said. I’m not going to directly attack their mainforce.”Zedd supposed she did remember it well. She had been there with Richard-theyhadn’t. Zedd brought up a touchy issue.“The main force will be in the center, well protected. At their edges, where youattack, will be defenses, of course, but mostly the camp followers will be atthe tail end of the Order’s camp-the fringe to the south, mostly.”“I don’t really care,” she said with cold fury. “If they’re with the Order, thenthey are the enemy. There will be no mercy.” She was looking at her new generalas she spoke her orders. “I don’t care if we kill their whores or theirgenerals. I want every baker and cook dead as much as I want every officer andarcher dead. Every camp follower we kill will deprive them of the comforts theyenjoy. I want to strip them of everything, including their lives. Is thatunderstood?”General Meiffert gave his nod. “No mercy. You’ll get no argument from us, MotherConfessor; that is the D’Haran code of warfare.”Zedd knew that, in war, Kahlan’s way was usually the only way to prevail. Theenemy would grant no mercy, and would need none themselves had they not invaded.Every whore and hawker chose to be a part of that invasion, to make what theycould off the blood and plunder spilled at the Order’s feet.Verna spoke up. “Mother Confessor, Ann was going to see you and Richard. We lastheard from her over a month ago. Have you seen her?”“Yes.”Verna licked her lips in caution at the steely look in Kahlan’s eyes. “Was sheall right?”“The last I saw her, she was.”“Would you know why she hasn’t sent any word to us?”“I threw her journey book in the fire.”Verna stepped forward, making to snatch Kahlan by the shoulder. Cara’s Agielcame up like lightning, barring her way.“No one touches the Mother Confessor.” Cara’s cold blue eyes were as deadly asher words. “Is that clear? No one.”“You have one Mord-Sith and one Mother Confessor, here, both in very bad moods,”Kahlan said in a level voice. “I would suggest you not give us an excuse to loseour temper, or we may never find it again in your lifetime.”Zedd’s fingers found Verna’s arm and gently urged her back.“We’re all tired,” he said. “We have enough troubles with the Order.” He shotKahlan a scowl. “No matter how tired or distraught we are, though, let’sremember we’re all on the same side here.”Kahlan’s eyes told him she challenged that statement, but she said nothing.Verna changed the subject. “I will get together some of the gifted to escort youon the raid.”“Thank you, but we will be taking no gifted.”“But you will at least need them to help you find your way in the dark.”“We will have the enemy campfires to show us our way.”“Kahlan,” Zedd said, hoping to interject some reason, “the Order will havegifted-including Sisters of the Dark. You will need protection from them.”“No. I don’t want any gifted with us. They are expecting any attack to beaccompanied by our gifted. Their gifted will be watching for shields of magic.Any riders they do see without detecting magic they will be more likely todiscount. We’ll be able to get in deeper and draw more blood without giftedalong.”Verna sighed at such foolishness, but didn’t argue. General Meiffert liked herplan. Zedd knew she was right about getting in deeper, but he knew, too, thatgetting back out would be more difficult, once the enemy was on to them.“Zedd, I would like one bit of magic.”He scratched his brow in resignation. “What would you like me to do?”Kahlan gestured at the ground. “Make that dust glow. I want it to show up in thedark, and I want it sticky.”“For how long?”She shrugged. “The rest of the night would be enough.”After Zedd had spun a web over the dusty patch of ground, giving it a greenglow, Kahlan bent and rubbed her hand in it. She walked around back of her horseand slapped the hand on each flank, leaving a glowing green handprint on eachhindquarter.“What are you doing?” Zedd asked.“It’s dark. I want them to be able to see me. They can’t come after me if theycan’t find me in the dark.”Zedd sighed at the madness.General Meiffert squatted and rubbed his hand in the glowing dust. “I’d alsohate for them to miss me in the dark.”“Be sure to wash your hand clean before we go,” she said.After she had explained her plan to the new general, Kahlan, Cara, and GeneralMeiffert started off to their tasks.Before they could get far, Zedd halted Kahlan with a softly spoken question.“Kahlan, do you have any idea how we can get Richard back?”She gazed boldly into his eyes. “Yes. I have a plan.”“Would you mind sharing it with me?”“It’s simple. I plan on killing every Imperial Order man, woman, and child untilI get to the very last one left alive, and then if she doesn’t give him back,I’m going to kill her, too.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 32Kahlan focused past the black void to the glowing points of the fires as sheleaned forward over the withers of her galloping horse, urging him onward,faster and faster. The muscles in her thighs strained as she pressed her weightagainst the stirrups and squeezed her legs against the feverish warmth of themassive body rhythmically, incessantly, frantically flexing and stretching,feeling its every pounding strike against the ground. Her ears were filled withthe hammering of her own heart and the thunder of yet more hooves behind her.She was distantly aware of the weight of the Sword of Truth sheathed in itsscabbard, an ever-present reminder of Richard.She gripped the reins in one fist. With her other, she lifted her royal Galeansword high. The lights were coming. Unexpectedly, the first came out of nowhereand exploded into her vision.Racing past what looked to be the light of a single candle, she was there, atlast. Crying out with the sudden power of emotions that could no longer bestifled, she slammed her sword down against the dark shape of a man. The impactof the blade against bone jarred her wrist. The hilt stung against her palm.On their way by, the men behind her unleashed their fury against the remainingsentries at the outpost. Kahlan held tight, knowing the greater unleashing ofher need was yet to come. She would not be denied, now.The fires of the outer fringes of the camp flew toward her. Her muscles wererigid with expectation. She felt at the brink of control. And then she was uponthem. At last, she was there. She met them with all her strength. Her blade camedown again and again, lashing against their bodies, slashing anyone within herreach. The outer fires shot past the sides of her horse with dizzying speed. Shegasped for breath.Laying the reins over, Kahlan pulled her big warhorse around in a tight circle.He was not as agile as she would have preferred, but he was well trained and forthis job he would do. He bellowed with the excitement of battle begun.Tents and wagons were scattered everywhere, with little apparent order. Kahlancould hear the merry laughter of those not yet aware of the enemy in theirmidst. She had brought a small attack force, keeping them tight and close on theway in so it wouldn’t raise the kind of alarm a broad attack would. It hadworked. She saw men around fires tipping up bottles, or eating meat off skewers.She saw men sleeping, with their feet sticking out of tents. She saw a manwalking with his arm around the waist of a woman. In the dim light she saw menin tents between the legs of other women.The couple, arm in arm-undoubtedly at a price-was close. The man was on the farside of the woman as Kahlan raced up behind them, so with a mighty swing shetook off the woman’s head, instead. The stupefied man clutched the headless bodyas it began to fall. The cavalry man right behind Kahlan took the startled mandown.Kahlan dug in her heels and charged her big warhorse over a haphazard row oftents with men and women inside. She could feel the huge hooves crushing bone.Screams rose around her and her mount.A soldier with a pike stood with his legs spread in a stance of sudden alarm. Onher way past, Kahlan snatched the pike from his grip, stabbed it into a smalltent, twisting it, getting the canvas tangled up on its barbs, and then backedher horse, hauling the tent off a man and woman. Her men following behindstabbed the exposed couple as Kahlan pulled the remnants of the tent through afire. As soon as it lit, she dragged the flaming canvas to a wagon, setting thatwagon’s tarp afire, and then threw the blazing remains in another wagon full ofsupplies.With a backhanded swing of her sword, Kahlan smashed the face of a burly man whoran up to pull her off her horse. She had to yank the blade free of his skull.Before more men could snatch at her, she dug in her heels again and charged offtoward another fire, where men were just jumping to their feet. The horseknocked down several, and her sword cut another. By now, the shrieks of womensent up an effective alarm, and men were rushing out of tents and wagons withweapons in their fists. The whole scene was one of erupting pandemonium.Kahlan wheeled her mount, stabbing anyone within reach. Many were not soldiers.Her sword felled leatherworkers and wagon masters, whores and soldiers.High-stepping at her command, her horse trampled down a line of big tents wherewounded were being cared for. Beside a lamp, Kahlan spotted a surgeon withneedle and thread working on a man’s leg. She drove her horse around to tramplethe surgeon and the man he was sewing up. The surgeon held his arms up beforehis face, but his arms were no good at warding the weight of a huge warhorse.Kahlan signaled her men in. Army surgeons were valuable. The D’Harans killedevery one they saw. She knew that killing each was as good as killing untoldnumbers of enemy soldiers. Kahlan and her men wreaked havoc through the whores’tents, toppled cook wagons, cut down soldiers and civilians alike. When her mensaw lamps, they leaped off their horses and snatched them up to use to startfires. Kahlan hacked at an enraged cook who came at her with a butcher knife. Ittook three rapid cuts to dispatch him.To her left, Cara’s horse cut off a man about to throw a spear. Cara coolly wentabout killing him and anyone else within her reach. A twist of her Agiel usuallyseized up their hearts, and if not, Kahlan could at least hear bones snap. Theircries of death and pain seemed frightful enough to send a shiver up the spinesof the dead, and did add to the general confusion and panic. It was gloriousmusic to Kahlan’s ears.The Agiel would only function through the bond to the Lord Rahl. Because itworked, she and Cara knew Richard was alive. That alone gave Kahlan heart. Itwas almost as if he were there with her. His sword strapped to her back was likehis hand touching her, encouraging her to throw herself into the fight, tellingher to cut.The indiscriminate nature of the killing in among the camp followers confusedthe enemy soldiers, and terrorized the people who commonly believed themselvesimpervious to the violence they ultimately fed off of. Now, rather than beingthe vultures picking at the carcasses, they were the hapless prey. Life in theImperial Order’s camp would never be the same-Kahlan would see to that. No morewould the enemy soldiers enjoy the comforts provided by these people. They wouldnow know they were no less targets than officers. They would know the price oftheir participation. The price was a merciless death and payment had come due.Slashing her way through the running crowds of screaming people, Kahlan kept aneye on a large group of the Imperial Order’s horses, stabled not far off,watching as soldiers threw saddles on their mounts. She drove her horse over menand tents, getting closer, until she was sure she was within earshot of thosecavalry men saddling their horses.Kahlan stood in her stirrups, waving her sword high in the air. Men paused tostare.“I am the Mother Confessor! For the crime of invading the Midlands, I condemnyou all to death! Every one of you!”The hundred men with her sent up a cheer. Their voices joined in a chant.“Death to the Order! Death to the Order! Death to the Order!”Kahlan and her men charged their horses around in an ever-widening circle,trampling anyone they could, hacking anyone within reach, stabbing anyone whorushed them, setting fire to anything that would burn. These D’Haran soldierswere the best at what they did, and they did it with brilliant effectiveness.When they found a wagon with oil, they broke the barrels open and tossed onflaming logs they plucked up with lances from fires. Night whooshed into day.Everyone could plainly see Kahlan, now, as she charged through their midst,screaming her pronouncement of death.Kahlan saw the Order’s cavalry mounting up, pulling their lances from racks,drawing their swords. She reared her horse, holding her sword high.“You are all cowards! You will never catch me or best me! You will all die likethe cowards you are at the hands of the Mother Confessor!”When her horse came down, she thumped its ribs with her boots. The horse chargedoff at a dead run, Cara right at her side, her hundred men at her heels, a fewthousand infuriated Imperial Order cavalry right behind them, with more mountingup all the time.Being at the edge of the Order’s camp, they wouldn’t have much ground to coverbefore they were out of the camp, again, and into the open countryside. As theyraced away, Kahlan took the opportunity to kill anyone who presented themselves.It was too dark to tell if they were men or woman, and it didn’t matter anyway.She wanted them all dead. Each time her sword made contact, slashing muscle orbreaking bone, was a delicious release.Running at full speed, past the last of the campfires, they plunged suddenlyinto the black void of night. Kahlan leaned forward over her horse’s muscularneck, as they ran west, hoping there were no holes in the ground. If they hitone, it would be all over not just for her horse, but, most likely, for her aswell.She knew this land well enough, the gentle hills, the bluffs ahead. She knewwhere she was, even in the dark, and she knew where she was going. She wascounting on the enemy not knowing. In the disorienting sweep of darkness, theywould fixate on following the glowing handprints on her horse’s rump, thinkingone of their gifted had gotten close enough to mark her horse for them. Theywould be gleeful with the blinding anticipation of having her naked to theirswords.Kahlan used the flat of her own sword to smack her horse’s flanks, urging himon, whipping him into a wild state. They were away from the excitement ofbattle, now, and out in the lonely openness of the countryside. Horses dreadedpredators nipping at their flanks, especially in the dark. She encouraged him tothink teeth were snapping at his hindquarters.Her men were right behind her, but, as instructed, rode to each side so therewas a gap, allowing the enemy to see the glowing marks on her horse. When Kahlanfeared she was as close as they dared get, she signaled with a whistle. Over hershoulders, she watched her men, her protection, peeling away, off into thenight. She would not see them again until she returned to the D’Haran camp.With her advantage of the distant fires of the Order’s camp in back of them,Kahlan was able to see the silhouette of the enemy cavalry close behind, comingat a full charge, their hungry gazes no doubt fixed on the glowing handprints onher horse’s flanks, the only thing they could see out in the wide-opencountryside on a moonless night.“How far?” Cara called over from close beside her.“Should be-”Kahlan’s words cut off when she suddenly spotted briefly what was right therebefore her.“Now, Cara!”Kahlan pulled her leg up just in time as Cara rammed her horse over. The twohuge animals jostled dangerously. Kahlan threw her arm around Cara’s shoulders.Cara’s arm seized Kahlan’s waist and yanked her over, off her horse. Kahlan gaveher horse one last smack with the flat of her sword. The horse snorted in panicas it charged onward at full speed into the blackness.Kahlan threw her leg over the rump of Cara’s horse, sheathed her sword, and thenheld tight to Cara’s waist as the Mord-Sith pulled her horse’s head hard to theleft, forcing it, at a full gallop, to turn away just in time.For an instant, through a break in the clouds, Kahlan spied the dull slur ofstarlight reflecting off the churning, icy waters of the Drun River below.She felt a pang of sorrow for her startled, bewildered, terrified horse as itsailed out over the bluff. It was giving its life to take many more with it. Thebeast would probably never know what had happened.Neither would the Imperial Order cavalry as they followed the glowing handprintson into the dark. This was her Midlands; Kahlan knew what was there; they wereinvaders, and did not. Even if they did see it coming in the last twinkling oftheir lives, at a full charge into pitch blackness they would never have achance to avert their doom.She hoped, though, that those men did realize what was happening just beforethey gasped in the frigid dark waters, or before their lungs burst with the needof air as the merciless river dragged them down into its inky embrace. She hopedevery one of those men suffered a horrifying death in the dark depths of thosetreacherous currents.Kahlan turned her thoughts away from the heat of battle. The forces of theD’Haran Empire could sleep, now, with a victory over their enemy and with thesweet taste of vengeance. Kahlan found that it did little, though, to quell thefires of her raging anger.After a brief time, Cara’s horse slowed to a canter, and then a walk. They heardno hoofbeats behind them, only winter’s vast silence. After the crush of people,the noise, and the turbulence of the Imperial Order’s camp, the isolation of theempty grasslands seemed somehow oppressive. Kahlan felt as if she were a speckof nothing in the middle of nowhere.Cold and exhausted, Kahlan pulled her fur mantle around her shoulders. Her legstrembled from the effort finally finished. She felt as if everything had beenwashed out of her. Her head slumped forward to rest against Cara’s back. Kahlanwas aware of the weight of Richard’s sword lying against her own back.“Well,” Cara said over her shoulder after they had ridden for a time through thehushed expanse of countryside, “we do this every night for a year or two, andthat should just about wipe them all out.”For the first time in what seemed an eternity, Kahlan almost laughed. Almost."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 33By the time Kahlan and Cara rode in among the wounded, the exhausted, and thesleeping D’Haran troops, it was only a few hours from dawn. Kahlan had thoughtthey might have to find a safe place out in the grasslands to sleep and wait fordaylight in order to find their way back, but they had been fortunate; a breakin the cloud cover had allowed the stars to show them the way. In the shimmeringsweep of stars alone, they had been able to see the black drape of mountains atthe horizon. With that visual guide, they were able to make their way far outinto the empty country so that they could safely get around the Imperial Order,and then head back north to their own troops.A reception party awaited them. Men rushed up to form cheering rows as theypassed into camp. Kahlan felt a distant sense of pride that she had given thesemen what they needed most right then: a measure of retribution. From the back ofCara’s horse, Kahlan lifted a hand to wave at the men she passed. She smiled forthem alone.Near the area where the horses were picketed, General Meiffert, having heard thecheering, was waiting impatiently. He trotted over to meet them. Beside the gateof the temporary corral, one of the soldiers took the reins to the horse asKahlan and then Cara jumped down. Kahlan winced at the ache in her muscles fromthe recent days of hard riding, and the night of fighting. Her right arm socketthrobbed from the blows she had landed. She mused to herself that her sword armnever hurt like that in her mock battles with Richard. For the benefit of anyonewatching, she forced herself to walk as if she had just had a three-day rest.General Meiffert, looking no worse for the battle he had seen that night,clapped a fist to his heart. “Mother Confessor, you can’t imagine how relieved Iam to see you.”“And I you, General.”He leaned forward. “Please, Mother Confessor, you aren’t going to do anythingthat foolhardy again, are you?”“It wasn’t foolhardy,” Cara said. “I was with her, watching out for her.”He frowned over at Cara, but didn’t argue with her. Kahlan wondered how onecould fight a war without doing anything foolhardy. The entire thing wasfoolhardy.“How many men did we lose?” Kahlan asked instead.General Meiffert’s face split with a grin. “None, Mother Confessor. Can youbelieve it? With the Creator’s help, they all came back.”“I don’t recall the Creator wielding a sword with us,” Cara said.Kahlan was dumbfounded. “That’s the best news I could have, General.”“Mother Confessor, I can’t tell you what a boost that was to the men. But,please, you won’t do anything like that again, will you?”“I’m not here to smile and wave and look pretty for the men, General. I’m hereto help them send those murderous bastards into the eternal arms of the Keeper.”He sighed in resignation. “We have a tent for you. I’m sure you’re tired.”Kahlan nodded and let the general lead her and Cara through the now quiet camp.Men not sleeping stood and silently saluted with fists to their hearts. Kahlantried to smile for them. She could see in their eyes how much they appreciatedwhat she had done to turn the tide of the grim battle back a little in theirfavor. They probably thought she had done it for them. That was only partlytrue.Arriving at a well-guarded group of a half-dozen tents, General Meiffertgestured to the one in the center.“This was General Reibisch’s tent, Mother Confessor. I had your things putinside. I thought you should have the best tent. If it bothers you to sleep inhis tent, though, I’ll have your belongings moved to anywhere you wish.”“It will be fine, General.” Kahlan took stock of the man’s young face, seeingthe shadow of sorrow. She reminded herself that he was about the same age asshe. “We all miss him.”His expression showed only some of the pain she thought he must feel. “I can’treplace a man like that, Mother Confessor. He was not just a great general, buta great man, too. He taught me a lot and honored me with his trust. He was thebest man I ever served under. I don’t want you to have any illusions about myreplacing him. I know I can’t.”“No one asked you to. Your best effort is all we expect and will serve us well,I’m sure.”He smiled at her generosity. “You’ll have that, Mother Confessor. I promise you,you’ll have that.” He turned to Cara and changed the subject. “I had your thingsput in this tent, here, Mistress Cara.” It was the one right beside Kahlan’stent.Cara scanned the scene, taking note of the patrolling guards. When Kahlan toldher that she was going to go right to bed, and that she should get some sleep,too, Cara agreed and bade the two of them a good night before disappearing intoher tent.“I appreciated your help, tonight, General. You should get some sleep, too.”He bowed his head, turned to leave, but then turned back.“You know, I always hoped to someday become a general. Ever since I was a boy,I’ve dreamed of it. I imagined . . .” He looked away from Kahlan’s eyes. “Iguess I imagined it would make me proud and happy.” He hooked his thumbs in hispockets and gazed out over the dark camp, perhaps seeing all those dreams fromhis past, or maybe seeing all his new duties.“It didn’t make me feel happy at all,” he finally said.“I know,” she answered in sincere sympathy. “This wasn’t the way any good manwould want to gain rank, but sometimes challenges arise, and we must face them.”She let out a silent sigh, and tried to envision how he must feel. “Someday,General, the pride and satisfaction will come. It comes from doing the job welland knowing that you are making a difference.”He nodded. “I know it felt pretty good, tonight, Mother Confessor, when I sawyou on the back of Cara’s horse, returning safely to camp. I look forward to theday when I see Lord Rahl ride into camp, too.” He started away. “Sleep well.Dawn is in a couple of hours. Then we’ll find out what the new day will bring.I’ll have reports ready for you.”Inside her tent, Zedd was sitting alone, waiting. Kahlan groaned inwardly.She was dead tired and didn’t want to face the old wizard’s questioning.Sometimes, especially if you were tired, his nettling questions could becomeirksome. She knew he meant well, but she was in no mood for it. She didn’t thinkshe could even be civil to him if he started down his road of a thousandquestions. It was so late, and she was so tired, she simply wished he would lether be.She stood just inside, saying nothing, watching him as he rose to his feet. Hiswavy white hair was more disorderly than usual. His heavy robes were filthy andspattered with blood. Around his knees the robes were dark with dried blood.He gave her a long look, and then enclosed her in his skinny arms. She justwanted to sleep. He silently held her head to his shoulder. Maybe he thought shemight be about to start crying, but there seemed no tears left. She felt numb.She supposed it was the constant rage, but she just couldn’t cry anymore. Sheseemed only able to feel anger.Zedd finally held her out at arm’s length, squeezing her shoulders in hissurprisingly strong fingers. “I just wanted to wait until you were back, andsafe, before I went to bed. I wanted to let my eyes take you in.” He smiled in asad way. “I’m so very relieved you’re safe. Sleep well, Kahlan.”Her bedroll, still tied up with its leather thongs, lay atop a pallet with astrawfilled mattress. Saddlebags were draped over her pack, sitting in thecorner. Opposite the bed there was a small folding table and chair. Beside them,a basket with rolls of maps. Another little folding table held a ewer and basin.A clean towel was draped over the table legs’ stretcher bar.The tent was spacious, by army standards, but it was still cramped. The canvaslooked heavy enough to keep out most any weather. Lamps, hanging at each end ofthe tent from a rod forming the peak of the roof, cast a warm glow inside thesnug tent. Kahlan tried to imagine the burly General Reibisch pacing in such asmall space, tugging his rust-colored beard, worrying over the problems of anarmy bigger than many cities.Zedd looked exhausted. Creases etched an inner anguish on his bony face. Shereminded herself that he had only just learned that his grandson, the onlyfamily he had left in the world, was in the cruel hands of the enemy.Besides that, Zedd had been fighting for two days and healing soldiers at night.She had seen him, when she arrived, staggering to his feet beside the corpse ofwhat turned out to be General Reibisch. She knew that if Zedd couldn’t save theman, he was beyond saving.With her fingers, Kahlan combed back her hair and then gestured to the chair.“You could sit for a minute, Zedd. Couldn’t you?”He looked at the chair, then at her bedroll. “For a minute, I suppose, while youget your bed ready. You need some rest.”Kahlan couldn’t argue with that. She realized her head was throbbing. Thepassions of battle masked little things, like a pounding headache. Thestraw-filled mattress looked as good as a feather bed to her right then. Shetossed her wolf-fur mantle and her cloak on the bed. They would keep her warm.Without comment, Zedd watched as she unstrapped the Sword of Truth and pulled itoff her back. He had given the weapon to Richard. Kahlan had been there, andbegged Zedd not to do it, but he said he had no choice, that Richard was theone. Zedd had been right. Richard was indeed the one.She felt her face flush when, just before she laid the sword down, she kissedthe top of the hilt, where Richard’s hand had so often rested. Zedd, if he evennoticed, said nothing, and she laid the gleaming scabbard and sword to restbeside her mattress.In the awkward quiet, Kahlan took off the royal Galean sword. She saw then thatthere was blood running down the scabbard. She unstrapped and removed the layerof light leather armor and laid it beside her pack. When she leaned the royalsword and scabbard against the plates of leather armor, she saw then that theywere splattered with blood.She noticed, too, that the leather leg armor had bloody handprints here andthere on it, and there were long gouges in the leather from mens’ fingernails.She remembered men grabbing for her, trying to unhorse her, but she didn’trecall their hands actually clawing at her. The images that started floodingback threatened to make her nauseated, so she directed her mind to other things.“Cara and I crossed over the Rang’Shada mountains, north of Agaden Reach, andcame down through Galea,” she said into the uncomfortable silence.“I gathered,” he said.She gestured vaguely to suggest the surrounding camp. “I thought I’d betterbring some troops with me.”“We can use them.”Kahlan glanced up at his hazel eyes. “I brought all I could without waiting. Ididn’t want to wait.”Zedd nodded. “That was wise.”“Prince Harold wanted to come, but I asked him to gather together a larger forceand then bring them down. If we’re to defend the Midlands, we’ll need moretroops. He thought that was a good idea.”“Sounds so.”“Prince Harold will be here to help just as soon as he can gather his army fromtheir defensive positions.”Zedd only nodded.She cleared her throat. “I wish we could have gotten here sooner.”Zedd shrugged. “You came as fast as possible. You’re here, now.”Kahlan turned away to the bedroll. She sank down to her knees and bent to thework of undoing the leather thongs holding the bedding all rolled up together.For some reason, the knots looked blurry-she guessed it was because she was sotired.She glanced over her shoulder briefly in the dim lamplight and then went back topicking at the knot. “I suppose you’d like to know how that Sister of the Darkmanaged to capture Richard.”He was silent for a moment. His voice finally came, soft and gentle. “There’stime enough for that later, Kahlan. There’s no need tonight.”As she picked at the stubborn knot, her hair fell forward over her shoulder. Shehad to push it back in order to see what she was doing. The stupid leather thongwas tightly knotted. She wanted to yell at the person who had tied it, but shehad done it up herself and had no one else to blame.“She used a maternity spell on me. It links us. She said she could-she couldkill me if Richard didn’t do as she said and go with her.”At the news, Zedd only let out a desolate sigh.“Richard can’t kill her, or I die, too.”She waited for his voice behind her. It finally came.“I’ve only read about such spells, but from what I know, it sounds as if shetold you the truth of it.”“I have a cut on my mouth. I didn’t do it. It happened to me the otherdaythrough that link. What happens to her happens to me. I hope Richard struckher. It was worth it.”“I don’t think Richard would do that.”She knew he wouldn’t. It was only a wish.One of the little lamps was flickering, making shadows waver. The other washissing softly. Kahlan wiped her nose on her sleeve.“Richard gave up his freedom to keep me alive. I wish I could die, to free him,but he made me promise I wouldn’t do that.”Kahlan felt a comforting hand on her shoulder. Zedd said nothing. It was thegreatest kindness he could have given her at that moment-not burying her heartunder an avalanche of questions.Enjoying the calming effect of his hand, Kahlan finally managed to get the knotundone. Zedd sat back in his chair as she unfurled her bedding. The carving ofSpirit was rolled up inside, for safekeeping. Its height was just right to fitcrosswise in her bedroll. Kahlan lifted it out and held it to her heart amoment. She turned, then, and set Spirit on the little table.Zedd slowly rose to his feet. He was a collection of bony angles under hismaroon robes. With one arm crooked to point while he gaped at Spirit standingproudly atop the small table, his lanky body looked as stiff as a spindly treein winter.“Where else did you stop on your way here?” He cast a suspicious look in herdirection. “Have you been looting treasures from palaces?”She realized then that the look wasn’t so much meant to be suspicious, asteasing. Kahlan ran a finger down Spirit’s flowing robes, letting her gazefollow the strength in the lines of the woman’s strong pose. Something felt soright about the way her head was thrown back, with her fists at her sides, andher back arched, standing against the invisible power trying to subdue her.“No.” Kahlan swallowed. “Richard carved it for me.”Zedd’s brow drew lower. He stared at the carving for a time before reaching outa sticklike finger to touch it, as if it were some priceless antiquity.“Dear spirits. . .”Kahlan pretended a smile. “Almost. It’s called Spirit, he said. Richard carvedit for me when I was feeling like I would never get better. It helped me . . .”In the awful silence, Zedd finally turned from the woman with her fists at hersides and her head thrown back to peer into Kahlan’s eyes. He frowned in theoddest way.“It’s you,” he said half to himself. “Dear spirits . . . the boy carved a statueof your spirit. I recognize it. It’s as plain as day.”Zedd was not only Richard’s grandfather-he was now hers, too. He was not merelythe First Wizard. He was also the man who had helped raise Richard. Zedd had nofamily left save Richard.Other than a half sister and brother who were strangers but for blood, neitherdid she. She was as alone in the world as was Zedd.Now, through Richard, Zedd was her family, but even if he wasn’t, she realizedhe could mean no less to her.“We’ll get him back, dear one,” he whispered in tender compassion. His sticklikehand reverently cupped her face. “We’ll get him back.”Everything seemed to be swimming. Kahlan fell into his protective arms anddissolved into tears."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 34Warren carefully pulled the snow-laden pine bough aside for her. Kahlan peeredthrough the gap.“There,” he said in a low voice. “You see?”Kahlan nodded as she squinted off into the narrow valley far below. The scenewas frosted whitewhite trees, white rocks, white meadows. Enemy troops moving upthe distant valley floor looked like a dark line of ants marching acrosspowdered sugar.“I don’t think you need to whisper, Warren,” Cara said from behind Kahlan’sother shoulder. “They can’t hear you. Not from this far.”Warren’s blue eyes turned to the Mord-Sith. Cara’s red leather would have stoodout like a beacon, were she not sheathed in wolf fur that made her melt into thebackground of snow-dusted brush. Kahlan’s own fur mantle was soft and warmagainst the sides of her face. Sometimes, since Richard had made it for her, thefeel against her skin was evocative of his gentle caress protecting her andkeeping her warm.“Oh, but their gifted can hear us, Cara, even from this distance, if we are toovociferous.”Cara’s nose wrinkled. “What’s that mean?”“Loud,” Kahlan whispered in a way as if to suggest Cara should use a little morecaution and be more quiet.Cara’s face distorted with her displeasure at the thought of magic. She shiftedher weight to her other foot, went back to watching the line of troops slowlyflowing up the valley, and kept silent.After she’d seen enough, Kahlan gestured, and the three of them started backthrough the ankledeep snow. At their elevation in the mountains, they were rightat the base of oppressive gray clouds, making it feel as if they were lookingdown from another world. She didn’t like the world she had seen.They trudged up the slope dense with pine and naked aspen, to the thickly woodedtop of the ridge, where the backbone of rock broke through the snow here andthere like half-buried bones. Their horses waited a good distance back down offthe rocky slope. Farther back down the mountain, where Warren and Kahlan weresure they would not be detected by any gifted who might be protecting the Ordertroops, waited an escort of D’Haran guards General Meiffert had handpicked toprotect Kahlan and the two with her, who were also protecting her.“So you see?” Warren asked in little more than a whisper. “They’re still atit-moving more and more men up this way, trying to get around us without usbeing aware of it.”Kahlan held up the fur to shelter her face as a light breeze dragged a curtainof snow past them. At least it wasn’t snowing again, yet.“I don’t think so, Warren.”His questioning, handsome face turned her way. “Then what?”“I think they want it to look like they’re sending troops past us so we willsend men way out here after them.”“A diversion?”“I think so. It’s just close enough to us to be likely we would discover them,yet far enough away and through difficult enough terrain that it would requireus to split our forces in order to do anything about it. Besides, every one ofour scouts came back.”“Isn’t that good?”“Sure it is. But what if they have gifted with them, as you believe? How is itthat not one of our scouts failed to make it back to report these massive troopmovements?”Warren thought that over a moment as the three of them carefully made it over ahigh spot, sliding on their bottoms down the far side of the slippery slopingrock.“I think they’re fishing,” Cara said as her boots thumped down on solid groundbehind them. “Their gifted don’t try to net the small fry, hoping to draw biggerfish close.”Kahlan brushed the snow from her backside. “Like us.”Warren looked skeptical. “You think this is all just some sort of elaborate trapto snare officers or gifted?”“Well, no,” Kahlan said. “That would only be a bonus for them. I think theirmain intent is to spur us into splitting our forces to deal with what they wantus to believe is this threat.”Warren scratched his head of curly blond hair. His blue eyes twitched back inthe direction the three of them had come down off the ridge, as if trying tolook again at what he could not see.“But if they’re sending great numbers of troops north-even if it is to draw awaysome of our forces-shouldn’t that concern us?”“Of course it should,” Kahlan said. “If it were true.”Warren glanced over at her as they struggled through deeper snow drifted undercrags they passed beneath on their way up a steep little rise. Her legs wereweary with the effort. Warren held out his hand to help her up a high step. Hedid the same for Cara. Cara gestured that she didn’t need the hand, but shedidn’t level a scowl at him, either. Kahlan was always pleased to see evidencethat Cara was learning that offers of modest aid were simply a courtesy and notnecessarily accusations of weakness.“Then I’m confused,” Warren said as he panted.Kahlan came to a halt to let them all catch their breath. She lifted an arm backtoward the enemy troops off beyond the ridge.“Yes, if it were true that great numbers of troops were going out around us andheading north, that would concern us. But I don’t believe they are.”Warren swiped a blond lock off his forehead. “You don’t think all those men areheading north? Where, then?”“Nowhere,” Kahlan said.“That many men? You’ve got to be joking.”She smiled at the look on his face. “I believe it’s a trick. I think it’s only asmall number of men.”“But the scouts have been reporting mass numbers of men moving north for threedays now!”“Hush,” Cara warned, getting even with an air of mock scolding.Warren covered his mouth with both hands when he realized he’d shouted.They had their breath back, so Kahlan started out again, taking them over thetop of the little rise onto flatter ground, following their footsteps back theway they had come.“Remember what the scouts said yesterday?” she asked him. “They tried to go overto the mountains on the other side to have a look at the lay of the land beyondand the enemy troops moving north through it, but the passes were too heavilyguarded?”“I remember.”“I think I’ve just figured out why.” She gestured by looping her hand around asshe went on. “I think what we’re seeing is a relatively small group of the samemen just going around in a big circle. We’re only seeing them at the point wherethey pass up this valley. We see troops marching by continuously for days and weassume they’re moving a lot of men, but I think it’s just a circle of the sameones going round and round.”Warren stopped to stare at her. His face turned grave at the implications. “Soif we’re tricked into thinking they’re moving an army up this way, then we willsplit our army in response and send part of them out after this phantom force.”“We’re already outnumbered,” Cara said as she nodded to herself, “but we havethe advantage of defending terrain that suits our purpose. However, if theycould reduce our numbers substantially simply by getting us to send a largepercentage off on some mission, first, their entire army might finally be ableto overrun a smaller number of remaining defenders.”“Makes sense.” Warren stroked his chin in thought, looking back at the ridge.“What if you’re wrong?”Kahlan turned to look back toward the ridge, too. “Well, if I’m wrong, then. ..”Kahlan frowned at a fat old maple tree not ten feet away. She thought she sawthe bark move. The dusting of snow on the scaly gray, furrowed bark begandisappearing, melting away in an ever widening area. Like dross floating on thesurface of a boiling cauldron, the bark moved.Kahlan gasped as Warren seized her and Cara by the collar and flung them bothdown on their backs. The wind knocked from her lungs, Kahlan tried to sit up,but Warren dived to the ground between them, pinning them both down.Before Kahlan had a chance to get her breath or ask what was wrong, blindinglight flashed in the still woods. A deafening boom rent the air and jolted theground beneath her. Splintered wood, from toothpick-size fragments tofence-post-size sections, howled past inches above her face. Huge sections ofwood thanked as they rebounded off rocks. Others spun, caroming off tree trunks.Pieces tumbling along the ground kicking up snow peppered with frozen chunks ofdirt. The air went white as the shock from the blast blew a wall of snow up intothe air.If any of them had been standing, they would have been torn to shreds.As soon as the last pieces of timber, trailing smoke, thudded to ground, Warrenrolled toward her. “Gifted,” he whispered.Kahlan frowned at him. “What?”“Gifted,” he whispered again. “They focused their power to boil the frozen treeinside and make it explode. That’s how we lost so many men when we gathered backin that valley during the first battle, back just before you came to us. Theysurprised us.”Kahlan nodded. She peeked up, but saw no one. She glanced over to see if Carawas all right.“Where’s Cara,” she asked in an urgent whisper.Warren cautiously peered off, searching the empty scene. Kahlan lifted herself alittle on an elbow and saw only the disturbed snow where Cara had been.“Dear Creator,” Warren said. “You don’t suppose they’ve snatched her, do you?”Kahlan saw tracks where there had been none before, leading off to the side. “Ithink-”A scream that would have made a brave man blanch reverberated through the trees.It trailed off in an agonizing echo.“Cara?” Warren asked.“I don’t think so.”Kahlan carefully sat up and saw that a hole had been torn open in the crowdedgrowth of the forest crown, letting harsh light penetrate the shaded woodlandsanctuary below. The ground all around was littered with splintered wood, brokenbranches, huge limbs fallen to ground, and boughs ripped from other trees.Gouges down through the white layer of snow into the dark forest floor radiatedfrom a ragged bowl-shaped depression where the tree had been. Fragments of woodand root lay on the ground everywhere and were even caught up in the surroundingtrees.Warren put a hand to her shoulder, urging Kahlan to stay down as he rolled intoa crouch. She flipped over onto her stomach and cautiously rose up onto herhands and knees.Kahlan jumped up and pointed. “There.”Through the trees, she saw Cara returning. The Mord-Sith was herding a small manin obvious pain along before her. Each time he stumbled and fell, she kicked himin the ribs, rolling him through the snow before her. He cried out, his wordscoming as a whining cry that Kahlan couldn’t make out because of the distance.The words weren’t hard to imagine, though.Cara had captured one of the gifted. It was for tasks such as this thatMord-Sith had been created. For someone with the gift, trying to use magicagainst a Mord Sith was a mistake that cost them their control over their ownability.Kahlan stood, brushing snow from herself. Warren, his violet robes crusted withsnow, rose beside her, transfixed by the sight. This was one of the wizardsresponsible for killing so many men when the D’Harans had gathered in the valleyafter the Order began moving north. This was the vicious animal who did Jagang’sbidding. He didn’t seem like a vicious animal, now, as he wept and begged beforethe implacable captor driving him on before her.He was a bundle of rags, flinging out around him as he rolled through the snowwith a final mighty kick that deposited him at Kahlan and Warren’s feet. He layfacedown, whimpering like a child.Cara bent, seized him by his tangled mat of dark hair, and yanked him to hisfeet.It was a child.“Lyle?” Warren stared incredulously. “Lyle? It was you?”Tears ran from wintery eyes. He wiped his nose on the back of a tattered sleeveas he glared at Warren. Young Lyle looked to be a boy of perhaps ten or twelveyears, but since Warren knew him, Kahlan realized he was probably from thePalace of the Prophets, too. Lyle was a young wizard.Warren reached out to cup the boy’s bloody chin. Kahlan snatched Warren’s wrist.The boy lunged to bite Warren’s hand. Cara was quicker. She snatched him back bythe hair as she rammed her Agiel into his back.Shrieking in pain, he crumpled to the ground. She kicked the injured lad in theribs.Warren held his hands out, imploring. “Cara, don’t-”Her icy blue eyes turned up to challenge him. “He tried to kill us. He tried tokill the Mother Confessor.”She ground her teeth and, while looking Warren in the eye, kicked the whimperingboy again.Warren licked his lips. “I know . . . but...”“But what?”“He’s so young. It isn’t right.”“And so it would be better if we just let him kill us? Would that make it rightfor you?”Kahlan knew Cara was right. As difficult as it was to witness, Cara was right.If they died, how many men, women, and children would the Imperial Order go onto slaughter? Child though he was, he was a tool of the Order.Nonetheless, Kahlan gestured Cara that that was enough. When Kahlan signaled,Cara again seized his tangled mat of dirty hair in her fist and hauled him tohis feet. With Cara’s thighs at his back, he stood shivering, blood running downhis face, pulling short, ragged breaths.As Kahlan stared down into terrified, tear-filled brown eyes, she put on herConfessor’s face, the face her mother had taught her when she was but a littlegirl, the face that masked her inner tumult.“I know you’re, there, Jagang,” she said in a quiet voice devoid of emotion.The boy’s bloody mouth turned up in a smile that was not his own.“You made a mistake, Jagang. We’ll have an army soon on its way to stop them.”The boy smiled a vacant bloody smile, but said nothing.“Lyle,” Warren said, his voice brittle with anguish, “you can be free of thedream walker. You must only swear loyalty to Richard and you will be flee.Believe me, Lyle. Try. I know what it’s like. Try, Lyle, and I swear I’ll helpyou.”Kahlan thought that, with Warren there, a man he knew, he might throw himselftoward the unexpected light coming from the open dungeon door. The boy behindthe smile that was not his own watched Warren with longing that slowly curdledto loathing. This was a child who had seen the struggle for freedom bring horrorand death and knew that servile obedience brought rewards and life. He was notold enough to understand what more there was to it.With a gentle touch of her fingers, Kahlan urged Warren to back away. Hereluctantly complied.“This isn’t the first of Jagang’s wizards we’ve captured,” she said,offhandedly, to Warren. Her words, though, were not meant for Warren.Kahlan looked up into Cara’s stern blue eyes and then glanced off to the side,hoping the Mord-Sith understood the instruction.“Marlin Pickard,” Kahlan said, as if recalling the name for Warren, but herwords were still meant for Cara. “He was grown, and even with this pompouspretend emperor directing him, Marlin still wasn’t able to give us muchtrouble.”Marlin had in fact given them a great deal of trouble. He had nearly killed Caraand Kahlan both. Kahlan hoped Cara remembered how tenuous was her control oversomeone possessed by the dream walker.The mood in the quiet woods was still and tense as the boy glared up at Kahlan.“We discovered your scheme in time, Jagang. You made a mistake thinking youcould get by our scouts. I hope you’re with those men, so that when we wipe themout we can cut your throat.”The bloody grin widened. “A woman like you is wasted on the side of the weak,”the boy said in the menacing voice of a man. “You’d have a much better timeserving strength, and the Order.”“I’m afraid my husband likes me right where I am.”“And where is your husband, darlin? I was hoping to say hello.”“He’s around,” Kahlan said in the same dispassionate voice.She saw Warren, when she had spoken the words, move in a way that was a littletoo much like surprise.“Is he, now?” The boy’s eyes turned from Warren, back to Kahlan. “Why is it Idon’t believe you?”She wanted to kick the boy’s teeth in as she watched his cruel grin. Kahlan’smind raced, trying to figure out what Jagang could possibly know, and what hewas trying to discover.“You’ll see him soon enough, when we get this poor child back to camp. I’m sureRichard Rahl will want to laugh in your cowardly face when I tell him how wediscovered the great emperor’s plan to sneak troops north. He’ll want topersonally tell you what a fool you are.”The boy tried to take a step toward her, but Cara’s fist in his hair restrainedhim. He was a cougar on a leash, still testing its chains. The bloody smileremained, but it was not as self-satisfied as it had been. In the brown eyes,Kahlan thought she saw hesitation.“Ah, but I don’t believe you,” he said, as if losing interest. “We both knowhe’s not there at all. Don’t we, darlin?”Kahlan resolved to take a risk. “You’ll see him for yourself, soon enough.” Shemade to look as if she were going to turn away, but turned back to him instead.Kahlan let a sarcastic smile taint her lips. “Oh-you must mean Nicci?”The smile vanished from the boy’s face. The brow drew down, but he managed tokeep any anger out of his voice.“Nicci? I don’t know what you’re talking about, darlin.”“Sister of the Dark? Shapely? Blond hair? Blue eyes? Black dress? Surely, youwould remember a woman that hauntingly beautiful. Or, besides your othershortcomings, are you also a eunuch?”The eyes watched, and in them Kahlan could see careful calculations weighing herevery word. But it was Nicci’s words about Jagang that Kahlan was remembering.“I know who Nicci is. I know every private inch of her. One day, I will come toknow you as intimately as I know Nicci.”Such an obscene threat was somehow more chilling, coming as it did from themouth of a boy. It made her sick to her stomach to hear a child express Jagang’svile thoughts.The boy’s arm gestured for his master. “One of my beauties, and quite the lethallady, besides.” Kahlan thought she detected in Jagang’s gravelly growl a hint ofthe false bravado of a bluff. Almost in afterthought, he added, “You haven’treally seen her.”Kahlan heard in the assertion the ghost of a question he dared not ask, and knewby it that there was something more to this. She wished she knew what.She shrugged again. “Lethal? I wouldn’t know.”He licked the blood from his lips. “That’s what I thought.”“I wouldn’t know because she didn’t seem all that lethal. She didn’t manage toharm any of us.”The grin returned. “You lie, darlin. If you really saw Nicci, she would havekilled at least some of you, even if she didn’t manage to kill you all. Youcouldn’t best that one without her scratching someone’s eyes out, first.”“Really? So sure, are we?”The boy let out a belly laugh. “Darlin, I know Nicci. I’m sure.”Kahlan smiled her contempt into the boy’s brown eyes. “You know I’m telling youthe truth.”“Really?” he said, still chuckling. “How’s that?”“You know it’s the truth because she’s one of your slaves, so you should be ableto enter her mind. You can’t, though. I know why you can’t. Even though youaren’t too bright, I don’t suppose you’ll need to think too long to imagine whynot.”Fierce rage fired the boy’s eyes. “I don’t believe you.”Kahlan shrugged. “Suit yourself.”“If you saw her, then where is she now?”As she turned her back on him, Kahlan told him the brutal, bitter truth and lethim interpret it his own way. “Last I saw her, she was on her way intooblivion.”Kahlan heard the bellow behind her. She spun back to see Cara trying to stop himwith her Agiel. Kahlan heard the bone in his arm snap. It didn’t even slow him.The boy, in a wild rage, his hands clawed, his teeth bared, lunged for Kahlan.Half turned back to him, Kahlan lifted her hand against the full weight of theboy crashing toward her as he leaped for her throat. His small chest contactedher hand. His feet were clear of the ground. It felt not as if he were throwinghimself at her, but no more than dandelion fluff, floating to her on a breath ofair.Time was hers.It was not necessary for Kahlan to invoke her birthright, but merely to withdrawher restraint of it. Her feelings could provide her no safe haven; only thetruth would serve her now.This was not a small boy, hurt, alone, afraid.This was the enemy.The inner violence of her power’s cold coiled force slipping its bounds wasbreathtaking. It surged up from that deep dark core within, obedientlyinundating every fiber of her being.She could count each small rib under her fingers.She contained no hate, no rage, no horror . . . no sorrow. In that infinitesimalspark of time, her mind was in a void where there was no emotion, only theallconsuming rush of time suspended.He had no chance. He was hers.Kahlan did not hesitate.She unleashed her power.From an ethereal state as part of her innermost essence, that power became all.Thunder without sound jolted the air-exquisite, violent, and for that pristineinstant, sovereign.The boy’s face was twisted by the hate of the man who had controlled him. Inthat singular moment, if she was the absence of emotion, then he was theembodiment of it. Kahlan stared back into that lost child’s face, knowing thathe saw only her merciless eyes.His mind, who he was, who he had been, was already gone.Trees all around shook from the force of the concussion. Snow dropped frombranches and boughs. The terrible shock to the air lifted a ring of snow thatgrew around the two of them in an ever-expanding circle.Kahlan had known that Jagang could slip into and out of a person’s mind betweenthought, when time itself did not exist. She had no choice but to do as she haddone. She could not afford to hesitate. With Jagang in a person’s mind, evenCara could not control them.Jagang had burned his bridges behind him as he fled the young mind.The boy fell dead at Kahlan’s feet."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 35Kahlan swayed on her feet as she stood over the crumbled body of the boy,feeling her emotions flood back in. As always happened, using her Confessor’spower left her drained and exhausted. In the aftermath, the forest sat in silentjudgment. Here and there, the virgin snow around the small body exhibited itsred evidence.Only then did Kahlan even pause to consider if she might have killed Cara, too.A Mord-Sith would not live long after the touch of a Confessor. There had beenno choice. She had done her best to warn Cara, to let her know to get clear, butin the end Kahlan couldn’t allow her decision to be influenced by anyconsideration other than what had to be done. Hesitation could have meantdisaster.Now that it was over, though, dread roiled through.Kahlan looked around, and to the right saw Cara sprawled in the snow. If she hadbeen touching the boy when Kahlan unleashed her power . . .Cara groaned. Kahlan staggered to her and dropped to a knee. She clutched thefur at Cara’s shoulder and with a mighty effort pulled her over.“Cara-are you all right?”Cara squinted up with a look of disgust working its way to the surface of pain.“Well of course I’m all right. You didn’t think I would be foolish enough tohang on to him, did you?”Kahlan smiled in thankful relief. “No, of course not. I only thought you mighthave broken your neck jumping away.”Cara spat snow and dirt. “Nearly did.”Warren helped them both to their feet. Grimacing, he rubbed his shoulders andthen his elbows. From what Kahlan had often been told, being too close to aConfessor unleashing her power was a painful experience, sending a shock ofagony through every joint. Fortunately, it did no real damage and the sufferingfaded quickly.As Warren glanced over at the dead boy, she knew that there was other pain thatwould not leave so quickly.“Dear Creator,” Warren whispered to himself. He looked back at Kahlan and Cara.“He was just a boy. Was it really necessary-”“Yes,” Kahlan said in a forceful voice. “I’m positive. Cara and I haveencountered this situation before-with Marlin.”“But Marlin was grown. Lyle was so small . . . so young. What real harm-”“Warren, don’t start down the path of what-might-have-been. Jagang controlledhis mind, just as he controlled Marlin’s mind. We know about this. He was adeadly threat.”“If I couldn’t hold him,” Cara said, “nothing could.”Warren sighed in misery. He sank to his knees at the boy’s side. Warrenwhispered a prayer as his fingers stroked the boy’s temple.“I guess the blame rightly lies at Jagang’s feet.” Warren stood and brushed thesnow from his knees. “Ultimately, Jagang is the one who brought this about.”Kahlan could see the distant figures of their men, rushing up the hillside torescue her. She started down toward them.“If it pleases you to think so.”Cara stayed right with her. Warren struggled through the snow to catch up. Hesnatched Kahlan’s arm and pulled her to a stop.“You mean Ann, don’t you?”Kahlan schooled her anger as she studied Warren’s blue eyes.“Warren, you were a victim of that woman, too. You were taken to the Palace ofthe Prophets when you were young, weren’t you?”“I guess so, but-”“But nothing. They came and took you. They came and took that poor dead childback there.” Kahlan’s fingernails dug into her palms. “They came and tookRichard.”Warren pressed his hand gently to the side of Kahlan’s arm. “I know how itseems. Prophecy is often-”“There!” Kahlan angrily pointed back at the corpse. “There is prophecy! Deathand misery-all in the sacred name of prophecy!”Warren didn’t try to answer her rage.Kahlan forced control into her voice, if not the emotion behind it. “How manyare going to die needlessly in a perverted devotion to seeing prophecy carriedout? Had Ann not sent Verna here for Richard, none of this would be happening.”“How do you know that? Kahlan, I can understand how you feel, but how can you besure?”“The barrier stood for three thousand years. It could only be brought down by awizard born with both sides of the gift. There has been none until Richard. Annsent Verna to get him. Had she not, the barrier would still be there. Jagang andthe Order would be on the other side. The Midlands would be safe. That boy wouldbe playing ball somewhere.”“Kahlan, it’s not so simple as you make it seem.” Warren opened his hands in anexpression of frustration. “I don’t want to argue this with you, but I want youto understand that prophecy gets fulfilled in many ways. It often seeks its ownsolution. It could be that had Ann not sent for Richard, he would have, for someother reason, ventured down there and brought down the barrier. Who is to knowthe reason? Don’t you see? It could be that it was bound to happen, and Ann wassimply the means. If not her, then another.”Kahlan pulled angry breaths through gritted teeth. “How much blood, how manycorpses, how much grief will it take before you see the harm prophecy hasinflicted upon the world?”Warren smiled sadly. “I am a prophet. I’ve always wanted to be a prophet inorder to help people. I wouldn’t put my faith in it if I truly thought it wasthe cause of harm.” He smiled more brightly with a memory. “Don’t forget,without prophecy, you would never have come to meet Richard. Aren’t you betteroff having had him come into your life? I know I am.”Kahlan’s look of cold fury took the warm smile from his face.“I-would rather have been condemned to a lonely life without love, than to knowthat harm has come to him because he came into my life. I would rather neverhave met him, than to have come to know his value, and know that that value isbeing dashed on the rocks of this mad faith in prophecy.”Warren stuck his hands in the opposite sleeves of his purple robes as his gazesank to the ground. “I understand how you can feel that way. Please, Kahlan,talk to Verna.”“Why? She’s the one who carried out Ann’s orders.”“Just talk to her. I almost lost Verna because she felt the same way as you donow.”“Verna?”Warren nodded. “She came to believe she had been used maliciously by Ann. Fortwenty years she was on a fruitless search for Richard, when all the while Annknew right where he was. Can you imagine how Verna felt when she discoveredthat? There were other things, too. Ann tricked us into believing she was dead.She maneuvered Verna into being Prelate.” Warren pulled a hand from his sleeveand held his first finger and thumb an inch apart. “She was once this close tothrowing her journey book into a fire.”“She should have.”Warren’s sad smile returned. “I’m just saying it might make you feel better totalk to her. She will understand how you feel.”“What good is that going to do?”Warren shrugged. “Even if you’re right, so what? What’s done is done. We can’tundo it. Nicci has Richard. The Imperial Order is here in the New World.Whatever caused the events, they are upon us and we must now deal with thatreality.”Kahlan appraised his sparkling blue eyes. “You learned this studying prophecy?”His smile widened into a grin. “No. That was what Richard taught me. And, apretty smart woman I know just told me not to start down the path ofwhat-mighthave-been.”As much as she was of a mind to hold on to it, Kahlan felt her anger slippingaway. “I’m not so sure how smart she is.”Warren waved down at the troops charging up the hill with their swords drawn,signaling the allclear. The men slowed to a fast walk, but didn’t sheathe theirweapons.“Well,” Warren said, “she was smart enough to figure out Jagang’s plan, and inthe middle of being attacked by his gifted minion to keep her wits about her andto trick him into thinking she had fallen for his scheme.”Kahlan drew her face into a peevish scowl. “How old are you, Warren?”He looked surprised by the question. “I turned one hundred fifty-eight not longago.”“That explains it,” Cara griped, starting off down the hill. “Stop looking soyoung and innocent all the time, Warren. It’s just plain irritating.”By the time Kahlan, Cara, Warren, and their escort of guard troops arrived backin camp several hours later, it was a scene of furious activity. Wagons werebeing loaded, horses hitched, and weapons readied. Tents were not yet beingtaken down, but soldiers in their leather and chain-mail armor, and still eatingthe remnants of their dinners, were gathered around officers, listening toinstructions for when the order was given to send a force out to intercept theenemy moving north. Other officers in tents Kahlan passed were bent over maps.The aroma of stew drifting through the afternoon air reminded her how hungry shewas. Winter darkness came early, and the overcast made it feel like it wasalready evening. The endless cloudy days were getting to be depressing. Therewas little chance to see much of the sun; soon, heavier snow would make it downthis far south.Kahlan dismounted and let a young soldier take her horse. She no longer rode abig warhorse. She, and most of the cavalry, had switched to smaller, more agilemounts. For a clash between large units, big warhorses added weight to a charge,but since the D’Haran Empire forces were so outnumbered, they had decided itwould be best to trade weight far speed and maneuverability.By changing tactics in such a way, not just with the cavalry but with theirentire army, Kahlan and General Meiffert had been able to keep the Order offbalance for weeks. They let the enemy put a huge effort into a crushing attack,and then dodged it just enough to save themselves while letting the Order, beingtantalizingly close, wear themselves out. When the Order tired from the effortof such massive attacks and paused to rest, General Meiffert sent in glancingattacks to step on their toes and make them dance. Once the Order dug in for theexpected attack, Kahlan withdrew their forces to a more distant spot, renderinguseless the Order’s effort at building defenses.If the Order tried the same thing again, the D’Harans continued to harry themday and night, buzzing around them like angry hornets, but staying out of reachof a heavy swat. If the Imperial Order tired of not being able to sink theirteeth into their enemy, and turned their forces to go after population centers,then Kahlan had her men jump on their tails and put arrows in their backs asthey struggled to get free. Eventually, they would have to forget their thoughtsof plunder and turn back toward the threat.The Imperial Order was maddened by the D’Harans’ constant badgering tactics.Jagang’s men were insulted by that kind of fighting; they believed real men metface-to-face in the field of battle, and exchanged blow for blow. Of course, itdidn’t trouble their dignity that they greatly outnumbered the D’Harans. Kahlanknew such a meeting would be bloody and only to the Order’s advantage. Shedidn’t care what they thought, only that they died.The more angry and frustrating the Imperial Order became, the more recklesslythey behaved, launching impetuous attacks into well-ordered defenses, orheedlessly pressing men into doomed attacks trying to take ground they couldn’tpossibly take in such a fashion. It sometimes stunned Kahlan to watch so many ofthe enemy march into range below their archers, fall dead, only to have yet moremen march right in behind them, continuously adding corpses to a battlefieldalready choked with the dead and dying. It was insanity.The D’Harans had suffered several thousand dead or seriously wounded. On theother hand, Kahlan and General Meiffert estimated that they had killed orwounded in excess of fifty thousand of the enemy. It was the equivalent ofstepping on one ant as the colony poured out of its anthill. She could think ofnothing else to do but to keep at it. They had no choice.Kahlan, with Cara at her side, crossed a river of men to get to the commandtents sporting blue cloth strips. Unless you knew the day’s color code, findingthe command tents would be nearly impossible. Because of the fear of aninfiltrator or an enemy gifted finding and being able to kill a group of seniorofficers gathered together, they met in nondescript tents. Colored cloth stripsmarked many of the tents-the men used them as as system of finding their unitswhen they had to move on short notice and so often-so Kahlan got the idea ofusing the same system to identify the command tents. They changed the color codeoften so no one color would become known as the officers’ colors.Inside the cramped tent, General Meiffert looked up from where he bent over atable with a map unfurled at a cockeyed angle. Lieutenant Leiden, of Kelton, wasthere along with Captain Abernathy, the commander of the Galean forces Kahlanhad brought down with her weeks before.Adie was sitting quietly in the corner, as the representative of the gifted,watching the goings-on with her completely white eyes. Blinded as a young woman,Adie had learned to see using her gift. She was a remarkably talented sorceress.Adie was quite proficient at using that talent to do the enemy harm. Now she wasthere to help coordinate the Sister’s abilities with the needs of the army.When Kahlan inquired, Adie told her, “Zedd be down at the southern lines,checking on details.”Kahlan nodded her thanks. “Warren went down there to help, too.”Kahlan scrunched up her freezing toes in her boots, trying to bring feeling backto them. She blew warm air into her cupped hands and then turned her attentionto the waiting general.“We need to get together a good-sized force-maybe twenty thousand men.”General Meiffert sighed his frustration. “So they are moving an army up pastus.”“No,” she said. “It’s a trick.”The three officers frowned their puzzlement as they waited for an explanation.“I ran into Jagang-”“You what!” General Meiffert shouted in unbridled panic.Kahlan waved a hand, allaying his fears. “Not like you’re thinking. It wasthrough the body of one of his slaves.” She stuck her hands under her arms towarm them. “The important thing is that I played along with Jagang’s scheme sothat he would think we were falling for his plan.”Kahlan explained how Jagang’s ruse of troop movements was meant to work and howits true design was to draw away a good-sized force so as to leave thoseremaining behind weaker. The men listened as she laid it all out while pointingto the locations on the map.“If we were to send that many men out,” Lieutenant Leiden asked, “wouldn’t thatbe just what Emperor Jagang wanted?”“It would be,” she told him, “but that’s not what we’re going to do. I wantthose men to ride out of camp, to make it look as if we were doing what heexpected.”She leaned over the map, using a piece of charcoal to sketch in some of thenearby mountains she had just traveled through, and showed .them a lowland passaround several.Captain Abernathy spoke up. “We have my Galean troops-they’re close to thenumber you need to serve as the decoy.”“That’s what I was thinking,” General Meiffert said.“Done,” Kahlan said. She pointed at the map again. “Circle around thesemountains, here, Captain, so that when the Order attacks our camp, thinking toroll over us, your men can stick them in their soft side, right here, where theywon’t expect it.”Captain Abernathy, a trim man with a graying bushy mustache that matched hiseyebrows, nodded as he watched Kahlan pointing out the route on the map. “Don’tworry, Mother Confessor, the Order will believe we’re gone, but we’ll bestanding ready to drive right into their ribs when they come for you.”Kahlan turned her attention back to the general. “We’ll also need to secretlytrickle another force out of camp to wait at the opposite side of the valleyfrom Captain Abernathy, so that when the Order comes up the valley in themiddle, we can drive into their ribs from both sides at once. They won’t want tolet us cut off and trap part of their force, so they’ll turn tail. Then our mainforce can drive steel into their vulnerable backs.”The three officers considered her plan in silence, while outside the confusionof noise went on. Horses galloped past, wagons creaked and bounced along, snowunderfoot crunched as soldiers shuffled past, and men called out orders.Lieutenant Leiden’s eyes turned up toward Kahlan. “Mother Confessor, my Keltanscould be that other force. They’ve all served together a long time, and workwell in our own units under my command. We could begin slipping out of camp atonce and gather down there to wait for the attack. You could send a Sister withus to verify a prearranged signal, and then I could take my men in when CaptainAbernathy attacks from the opposite side.”Kahlan knew the man wanted to redeem himself in her eyes. He was also looking toestablish for Kelton a measure of autonomy within the D’Haran Empire.“That will be a dangerous spot, Lieutenant. If anything goes wrong, we can’tcome to your aid.”He nodded. “But my men are familiar with the area and we’re used to traversingmountainous country in the winter. The Imperial Order is from a warmer land. Wehave the advantage of weather and terrain. We can do the job, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan straightened, letting out a breath as she appraised the man. GeneralMeiffert, she knew, would like the idea. Captain Abernathy would, too; Galea andKelton were traditional rivals, so the two would just as soon fight their ownway, and separately.Richard had brought the lands together, so that they would all come to feel theywere one, now. That was vital if they were to survive. She supposed that theywere fighting for the same goal, so in that way they were working together-theywould have to coordinate their attacks. Lieutenant Leiden did make sense, too;his troops were mountain fighters.“All right, Lieutenant.”“Thank you, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan thought to add some insurance. “If you acquit yourself well in this,Lieutenant, it could move you up in command.”Lieutenant Leiden clapped a fist to his heart in salute. “My men will make theirqueen proud.”Kahlan acknowledged his pledge with the nod of the Mother Confessor. Sheaddressed them all. “We had better get under way.”General Meiffert grunted his agreement. “This will be a good opportunity toknock down their numbers. If it goes even half right, this time we’ll bleed themgood.” He turned to the other two officers. “Let’s get started. We need to haveyour men moving at once to give them enough time to be in position by morning.There’s no telling how long they might wait to attack, but if it comes as soonas dawn, I want you in position and ready.”“The Order favors attacking at dawn,” Captain Abernathy said. “We can be on ourway within the hour. We’ll be in place and ready by dawn, should they come inearly.”“As can we,” Lieutenant Leiden agreed.The two officers bowed and started to leave.“Captain,” Kahlan called. The men turned back.“Mother Confessor?”“Do you have any idea what could be keeping Prince Harold and the rest of yourarmy? He should have been here long ago. We could really use the rest of yourmen.”Captain Abernathy’s thumb twiddled a bone button on the front of his dark coat.“I’m sorry, Mother Confessor. I, too, thought they should have been here by now.I can’t imagine what could be keeping the prince.”“He should have been here by now,” she repeated under her breath to herself. Shelooked up at the captain. “Weather?”“Perhaps, Mother Confessor. If there are storms, that could have delayed him.That is probably the reason, and in that case I don’t imagine he should be muchlonger. Our men train in the mountains in such conditions.”Kahlan sighed. “Let’s hope he’s here soon, then.”Captain Abernathy confidently met her gaze. “I know for a fact that the princewas eager to collect his men and get down here to help. Galea spans theCallisidrin Valley. The prince personally told me that it was to our own bestinterest to halt the Imperial Order down here, rather than letting them advancefurther up into the Midlands, where our lands and our families would come underthe terror of the enemy.”Kahlan could see in Lieutenant Leiden’s eyes that he was thinking that if PrinceHarold instead decided to make a stand in the Callisidrin Valley, in order toselfishly protect his homeland of Galea, such an obstacle very well could forcethe Order to instead bear toward the northeast in their advance, around theintervening mountains, and over into the Kern Plain-right toward Leiden’shomeland of Kelton. If Lieutenant Leiden was imagining such treachery, he hadthe wisdom not to voice it.“I know the weather was bad when I came down,” Kahlan said. “It is winter, afterall. I’m sure Prince Harold will soon be here to help his queen and the fellowpeople of the D’Haran Empire.”Kahlan offered them a smile to soften the subtle threat. “Thank you, gentlemen.You’d best get to your tasks. May the good spirits watch your backs.”After the men had saluted and horned off to their work, Adie put her hands toher knees and levered herself to her feet.“If you do not need me, I must see to informing the Sisters, Zedd, and Warren ofour plans.”Kahlan nodded wearily. “Thank you, Adie.”Adie, her eyes completely white, saw with the aid of her gift. Kahlan could feelthat gifted gaze on her.“You have used your power,” the old sorceress said. “I be able to see it in yourface. You must rest.”“I know,” Kahlan said. “But there are things needing to be done.”“They will not get done if you fall ill, or worse-which could happen.” Adie’sthin fingers gripped Cara’s arm. “See to it that the Mother Confessor be leftalone for a while, so she can at least rest her head on the table, if nothingelse.”Cara swung the folding chair around and set it behind the table. She pointed atit while leveling a stern look at Kahlan.“Sit. I will stand watch.”Kahlan was exhausted. Using her Confessor’s ability sapped her strength. Sheneeded time to recover. The hard ride back had only made matters worse. She wentaround the table and sat down heavily in the folding chair. She opened her furmantle and set it back on her shoulders. Richard’s sword was still strapped toher back, its hilt jutting up above her shoulder. She didn’t bother to removethe sword.Adie, at seeing Kahlan comply without complaint, smiled to herself and went onher way. Cara took up guard at the entrance as Kahlan’s head sank down into herpillowed arms. Trying not to let the terrible events of the day overwhelm her,she instead thought of Richard, remembering his handsome smile, his penetratinggray eyes, his gentle touch. Her own eyes closed. In her weariness, the chairand table felt as if they were spinning her around. In moments, though, as sheheld her thoughts of Richard in her mind’s eye, she felt herself sliding intosleep."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 36“Mother Confessor?”Kahlan squinted up at a dark shape above her. She blinked, clearing her vision,and saw that it was Verna. The gold sunburst ring of the Prelate of the Sistersof the Light reflected a glimmer of lamplight. Behind her, twilight tainted thetent canvas with a rusty glow.Kahlan rubbed the sleep from her eyes. Verna wore a long, gray wool dress and adark brown cloak. At her throat, the dress had a bit of white lace that softenedthe austerity of the outfit. Verna’s brown hair had a carefree wave and springto it, but her brown eyes held a troubled look.“What is it, Verna?”“If you have a moment, I would like to talk to you.”No doubt, Verna had been talking to Warren. Whenever Kahlan saw them together,the shared intimate glances, the chance furtive touch reminded her of the wayshe and Richard felt about each other. It softened Kahlan’s feelings aboutVerna’s stern exterior, to know she was in love-knowing, for that matter, thatshe was capable of tenderness. Kahlan knew that she, too, must be regarded withthe same sort of curiosity, if not amazement, where tender feelings wereconcerned.She sighed, wondering if this was going to be a “talk” about Ann and prophecy.Kahlan wasn’t in the mood.“Cara, how long have I been asleep?”“A couple of hours. It will soon be dark.”As tight and sore as Kahlan’s shoulders and neck were from sleeping with herhead on the table, the lateness of the hour didn’t come as a surprise. Shestretched to the side and then saw the frail looking sorceress sitting on ashort bench. She had a dark blanket over her lap.“How do you feel?” Adie asked.“I’m fine.” Kahlan could see her breath in the frigid air. “The men we sentout?”“Both groups be on their way, more than an hour ago,” Adie said. “The firstgroup, the Galeans, all left together in big columns. The Keltans dribbled outin small groups not as likely to be noticed by any spies watching.”Kahlan yawned. “Good.”She knew they had to fear an attack by the Imperial Order as soon as morning. Atleast that should give their men enough time to travel to their positions and beready. Waiting for an attack made her stomach feel queasy. She knew the men,too, would be on edge and likely get little sleep.Adie idly ran a thin finger back and forth along the red and yellow beads at theneckline of her modest robes. “I came back after the Galeans left, to help Carakeep people away so you would not be disturbed while you rested.”Kahlan nodded her thanks. Apparently, either Adie thought Kahlan had restedenough, or she thought Verna’s visit was important.“What is it, then, Verna?”“We have . . . discovered something. Not so much discovered it, as had an idea.”“Who is `we’?”Verna cleared her throat. Under her breath she beseeched the Creator’sforgiveness before she went on.“Actually, Mother Confessor, I thought of it. Some of my Sisters helped me withit, but I’m the one who thought it up. The blame falls to me.”Kahlan thought that was an odd way of putting it. She didn’t think Verna lookedat all pleased by her own idea, whatever it was. Kahlan waited silently for herto go on.“Well, you see, we have a problem getting things past the enemy’s gifted. Theyhave Sisters of the light, but also Dark, and we don’t have their power. When wetry to send things-”“Send things?”Verna pursed her lips. “Weapons.”When Kahlan’s brow twitched with a questioning look, Verna bent and gatheredsomething from the ground. She held out her open hand, showing Kahlan acollection of small pebbles.“Zedd showed us how to turn simple things into devastating weapons. We can useour power to fling them or even with our breath blow on some small thing, likethese pebbles, and use our magic to send them out faster than any arrow, even anarrow from a crossbow. The pebbles we flung out in this way cut down waves ofadvancing soldiers. The pebbles traveled so swiftly that sometimes each wouldpierce the bodies of half a dozen men.”“I remember those reports,” Kahlan said. “But that stopped working because theirgifted caught on to the artifice and now defend against such things.”Kahlan recognized the weary look of the weight of responsibility in Verna’sbrown eyes. “That’s right. The Order learned how to look for things of magic, oreven things propelled by magic. Most of our conjuring that is in any way similarhas become useless.”“That’s what Zedd told me-that in war magic is most often unseen, that each sidemanages only to balance the other.”Verna nodded. “It is so. We do the same against them. Things they used at first,we now know how to counter so we can protect our men. Our warning horns, forexample. We learned that we must code them with a trace of magic to know theyare genuine.”Kahlan drew her fur mantle up around her neck. She was chilled to the bone andcouldn’t seem to get warm. Not surprising, seeing as how she was spending all ofher time outdoors. It was insanity to be carrying on a war in such conditions.She guessed that war in fine weather was no more sane. Still, she ached to beinside, beside a cozy fire.“So what is this thing you thought up?”As if reminded of the cold, Verna pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders.“Well, I got the notion that if the enemy gifted are, in a sense, filtering foranything magic, or even anything being propelled by magic, then what we need issomething not magic.”Kahlan gave Verna a grim smile. “We do. They’re called soldiers.”Verna didn’t smile. “No. I meant something the gifted could do to disable enemytroops without risk to our own men.”Adie shuffled forward to stand behind Kahlan’s left shoulder as Verna reachedinto her cloak and pulled out a small leather pouch closed with a drawstring.She tossed it on the table before Kahlan, then set a piece of paper beside it.“Pour a little on the paper, please.” Verna was holding her stomach as if shewere having indigestion. “But be careful not to touch it with your finger or getit on your skin-and whatever you do, don’t blow on it. Be careful not to evenbreathe on it.”Adie leaned in to watch as Kahlan carefully poured a small quantity of asparkling dust from the pouch onto the square of paper. She pushed at the littlepile with the corner of the pouch. There were hints of pallid colors, but it wasmostly a pale, glimmering, greenish-gray.“What is it? Some kind of magic dust?”“Glass.”Kahlan’s eyes turned up. “Glass. You thought up glass?”Verna let out a tsk at herself for how foolish she must have sounded. “No,Mother Confessor. I thought of breaking it. You see, this is just simple glassthat has been broken and crushed into fine pieces-almost dust. But we used ourHan to aid us when we crushed the glass with a mortar and pestle. By using ourgift, we were able to break the glass into very tiny fragments, but in a specialway.”Verna leaned over, her finger hovering above the little greenish-gray mound.Cara leaned in beside her in order to look down at the dangerous thing on thepiece of paper.“This glass-every piece-is sharp and jagged, even though each piece is verytiny. Each piece is hardly bigger than dust, so it weighs nothing, almost likedust.”“Dear spirits,” Adie said before whispering a prayer in her own language.Kahlan cleared her throat. “I don’t understand.”“Mother Confessor, we can’t get our magic past the defenses of the Order’sgifted. They are prepared for magic, even if it’s a simple pebble but uses magicto hurl it at their troops.“This glass, however, even though we used magic to break it, has no magicproperties-none at all. It’s just inert material, the same as the dust kicked upby their feet. They can’t detect it as magic, because it isn’t magic. Throughtheir gift, they will sense this as simple as dust, or mist, or possibly fog,depending on atmospheric conditions at the time.”“But we sent dust clouds at them before,” Kahlan said. “Dust to make them sickand such. They mostly countered it.”Verna held up a finger to note her point as she smiled a grim smile. “But thosewere dust clouds containing magic. Mother Confessor, this does not. Don’t yousee? It’s so light it floats in the air for a long time. We could use simplemagic to cast it up into the air, and then withdraw the magic, or we couldsimply fling it up into the breeze, for that matter. Either way, we have only tolet their troops run through it.”“All right.” Kahlan scratched an eyebrow. “But what will it do to them?”“It will get in their eyes,” Adie said in her raspy voice from behind Kahlan’sshoulder.“That’s right,” Verna said. “It gets in their eyes, just as any dust would. Atfirst, it will feel like dust in their eyes and they will try to blink it away.However, since the fragments are all still jagged and razor sharp, they willinstead embed themselves in the body’s tissue. It will stick in their eyes, andbuild up under their eyelids, where it will make thousands of tiny cuts acrosstheir eyes with each blink. The more they blink, the more it eats away at theirdelicate eyes.” Verna straightened and pulled her cloak together. “It will blindthem.”Kahlan sat in numb disbelief at the madness of it all.“Are you sure?” Cara asked. “Might it just irritate them, like gritty dust?”“We know for sure,” Verna said. “We . . . had an accident, and know all too wellwhat it does. It may do more damage when it gets in the throat, the lungs, andthe gut-we don’t know about that, yet-but we do know for sure that such specialglass, if we grind it to just the right size particles, will float in the airand people passing through the cloud will be blinded in remarkably short order.As long as we can blind a man, he can’t fight. It may not kill them, but as longas they are blind they can’t kill us, or fight back as we kill them.”Cara, usually gleeful at the prospect of killing the enemy, did not seem so,now. “We would have but to line them up and butcher them.”Kahlan put her head in her hands, covering her eyes.“You want me to approve its use, don’t you? That’s why you’re here.”Verna said nothing. Kahlan looked up at last.“That’s what you want, isn’t it?”“Mother Confessor, I need not tell you that the Sisters of the Light abhorharming people. However, this is a war for our very existence, for the veryexistence of free people. We know it must be done. If Richard were here . . . Ijust thought that you would want to be made aware of this, and be the one togive such orders.”Kahlan stared at the woman, understanding then why she was holding her hand overa pain in her stomach.“Do you know, Prelate,” Kahlan said in a near whisper, “that I killed a childtoday? Not by accident, but on purpose. I would do it again without hesitation.But that won’t make me sleep any better.”“A child? It was truly necessary to . . . kill a child?”“His name was Lyle. I believe you know him. He was another one of the victims ofAnn’s Sisters of the Light.”Verna, her face gone ashen, closed her eyes against the news.“I guess if I can kill a child,” Kahlan said, “I can easily enough give theorders for you to use your special glass against the monsters who would use achild as a weapon. I have sworn no mercy, and I meant it.”Adie laid a gnarled hand on Kahlan’s shoulder.“Kahlan,” Verna said in a gentle voice, “I can understand how you feel. Ann usedme, too, and I didn’t understand why. I thought she used everyone for her ownselfish purposes. For a time, I thought her a despicable person. You have everyreason to believe as you do.”“But I would be wrong, Verna? Is that what you were going to add? I’d not be sosure, were I you. You didn’t have to kill a little boy today.”Verna nodded in sympathy but didn’t argue.“Adie,” Kahlan asked, “do you think there would be anything you might be able todo for the woman who was accidentally blinded? Perhaps you could help her?”Adie nodded. “That be a good idea. Verna, take me to her, and let me see what Ican do.”Kahlan cocked her head as the two women moved toward the tent opening. “Did youhear that?”“The horn?” Verna asked.“Yes. It sounds like alarm horns.”Verna squinted in concentration. She turned her head to the side, listeningattentively.“Yes, it does sound like alarm horns,” she finally declared, “but it doesn’thave the right trace of magic through it. The enemy does that often-tries to getus to act based on false alarms. We’ve been having more and more lately.”Kahlan frowned. “We have? Why?”“Why . . . what?”Kahlan stood. “If we know they’re false alarms, and they don’t work, then whywould the Order increase the attempts? That makes no sense.”Verna’s gaze roved about as as if searching in vain for an answer. “Well, Idon’t know. I can’t imagine. I’m no expert in the tactics of warfare.”Cara turned to go have a look. “Maybe it’s just some scouts coming back in.”Kahlan turned her head, listening. She heard horses running, but that wasn’t sorare. It could be, as Cara suggested, scouts returning with reports. But, by thesound of the hooves, the horses sounded big.She heard men yelling. The clash of steel rang out-along with cries of pain.Kahlan drew her Galean royal sword as she started around the table. Before anyof them could get more than a step, the tent shuddered violently as somethingcrashed against its walls. For an instant, the whole thing tipped at animpossible angle; then steel-tipped lances burst through the canvas. With a rushof wind the tent collapsed around them.The heavy canvas drove Kahlan to the ground as it caved in. She couldn’t get agrip on anything solid as the tent rolled her over and began dragging her along.Hooves thundered past, pounding the ground right beside her head.She could smell lamp oil as it sloshed across the canvas. With a whoosh, the oiland the tent ignited. Kahlan coughed on the smoke. She could hear the crackle offlames. She could see nothing. She was trapped-rolled up in the bucking tent asit slid across the ground."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 37Tightly shrouded in stiff canvas, Kahlan couldn’t see anything. She choked andgagged on the thick, acrid smoke burning her lungs. She pulled frantically atthe canvas, trying to disentangle herself, but as she bounced and tumbled alongthe ground, she couldn’t make any headway gaining her liberty. The heat offlames close to her face ignited in her a sense of panic. Her wearinessforgotten, she kicked and struggled madly as she gasped for air.“Where are you!”It was Cara’s voice. It sounded close, as if she, too, was being dragged alongand strenuously engaged in her own fight for life. Cara was smart enough not toshout Kahlan’s name or title when surrounded by the enemy; hopefully, Verna knewbetter, as well.“Here!” Kahlan shouted in answer to Cara.Kahlan’s sword was trapped, pressed to her legs by the rolled canvas. Shemanaged to wiggle her left hand up onto the knife at her belt. She yanked itfree. She had to turn her face to try to keep away from the heat of the oilyflames. The smothering smoky blindness was terrifying.With angry resolve, Kahlan stabbed at the canvas, punching her knife through.Just then, the tent hit something and they were bounced into the air. The hardlanding knocked the wind from her lungs. A gasp pulled in suffocating smoke.Again, Kahlan plunged her knife into the heavy canvas and slashed an opening asher entire shroud erupted into flame.She yelled again to Cara. “I can’t get-”The tent hit something solid. Her shoulder whacked hard into what felt like atree stump and she was flipped up and over the top of it. Had she not beenwearing her stiff leather armor, the blow surely would have broken her shoulder.Crashing down on the other side, Kahlan tumbled free and across the snow. Shespread her arms to stop herself from rolling.Kahlan saw General Meiffert reach up, seize a fistful of chain mail, and unhorsethe man who had been dragging her tent. The man’s eyes gleamed from behind long,curly, greasy hair. His stout body was covered with hides and furs over chainmail and leather armor. He was missing his upper teeth. As he lunged at thegeneral, he lost his head, too.Yet more Order troops wheeled their big warhorses, striking down at the D’Haransscrambling both to escape the blows and to mount a defense. One of the warhorsescharged Kahlan’s way, its rider leaning out, swinging a flail. Kahlan sheathedboth her knife and sword. She snatched up the lance of the man who had beendragging the tent. She brought the long weapon up and spun around just in timeto plant the butt end in a frozen rut and let the charging warhorse take thesteel-tipped point in his chest.As the grinning Order soldier with the flail leaped from the staggering horse,he drew his sword with his free hand. Kahlan didn’t wait; as he was stillalighting on his feet, she spun while drawing her own sword and landed a solidbackhanded blow across the left side of his face.Without pause, she dove under the legs of another horse to dodge a blade whenthe horse’s rider slashed down at her. She sprang up on the other side andhacked the rider’s leg open to the bone twice before turning just in time to ramher sword up to its hilt into the chest of another horse sidling in, trying tocrush her against the first. As the animal reared with a wild scream, Kahlanyanked her sword free and tumbled away just before the big horse crashed to theground. The rider’s leg was trapped, and he was at an awkward angle to defendhimself Kahlan made the best of the opportunity.For the moment, the immediate area was clear, enabling her to scramble over tothe tent where the general was on his knees, yanking at the snarled mess ofcanvas and rope. More Order cavalry were thundering past, threatening to trampleVerna, Adie, and Cara still trapped in the tangle of tent. At least the burningsection had pulled away.Kahlan worked beside General Meiffert to tug and cut the canvas. At last theyripped open the heavy material, freeing Adie and Verna. The two women wererolled up together, nearly in each another’s arms. Adie’s head was bleeding, butshe pushed away Kahlan’s concerned hands. Verna emerged from the cocoon andstumbled to her feet, still dizzy from the wild ride.Kahlan helped Adie up. The scrape on her brow didn’t look too serious. GeneralMeiffert pulled frantically at the canvas. Cara was still inside, somewhere, butthey no longer heard her.Kahlan seized Verna by the arm. “I thought they were false alarms!”“They were!” Verna insisted. “Obviously, they tricked us.”All around, soldiers were engaged in pitched battle with Imperial Order cavalry.Men shouted in fury as they threw themselves into battle; some screamed as theywere wounded or killed; others called out orders, commanding a defense, whilethe men on horseback ordered in their attack.Some of the cavalry were setting fire to wagons, tents, and supplies. Otherscharged past, trampling men and tents. Pairs of riders teamed up to single outsoldiers and take them down, then charged after another victim.They were using the same tactics the D’Harans had used. They were doing whatKahlan had taught them to do.When a soldier, draped in filthy fur and weapons, cried out in bravado as herushed at her wielding a raised mace studded with glistening bloody spikes,Kahlan took his hand off with a lightning-swift blow. He staggered to a stop andstared a her in surprise. Without missing a beat, she drove her sword into hisgut and gave it a wrenching twist before pulling it free. She turned herattention elsewhere as he crashed down atop a fire. His screams melted in withall the others.Kahlan fell to her knees once more to help General Meiffert free Cara. He hadfound her amid the snare of rope and folds of canvas. From time to time one ofthem had to turn to fight off sporadic attackers. Kahlan could see Cara’s redboots sticking out from under the canvas, but they were still.Tent line was tangled around Cara’s legs. With Kahlan and the general workingtogether, they cut through the mire of rope and were finally able to unrollCara. She held her head as she moaned. She wasn’t unconscious, but she wasgroggy and unable to get her bearings. Kahlan found a lump in her hair, at theright side of her head, but it wasn’t bleeding.Cara tried to sit up. Kahlan pressed her down on her back.“Stay there. You were hit on the head. I don’t want you to get up just yet.”Kahlan looked over her shoulder and saw Verna, nearby, singling out ImperialOrder troops, each twitch of her hands casting a fiery spell to blast them fromtheir horses, or a focused edge of air as sharp as any blade, yet more swift andsure, to slice them down. Without the gift themselves, or one of the gifted toprotect them, the enemy’s simple armor was no defense.Kahlan caught Verna’s attention and motioned for her help. Seizing the woman’scloak at her shoulder, Kahlan pulled Verna close to speak into her ear so as tobe heard above the noise of battle.“See how she is, will you? Help her?”Verna nodded and then huddled at Cara’s side as Kahlan and the general turned toa fresh charge of cavalry. As one man galloped in close, wielding his lancearound, General Meiffert dodged the strike and then leaped up onto the side ofthe horse, catching hold of the saddle’s horn. With a grunt of angry effort, hedrove his sword through the rider. The surprised man clawed at the blade in hissoft middle. The general yanked his sword free, then grabbed the man by the hairand dragged him out of the saddle. As the dying man fell away, General Meiffertsprang up into the saddle, in his place. Kahlan snatched up the fallencavalryman’s lance.The big D’Haran general wheeled the huge horse into the way of charging enemycavalry, protecting Verna and Cara. Kahlan sheathed her sword and used the lanceto good effect against the warhorses. Horses, even well-trained warhorses,didn’t appreciate being stabbed in the chest. Many people considered them justdumb beasts, but horses were smart enough to understand that driving themselvesonto a pointed lance was not what they wanted to do, and reacted accordingly.As horses bucked and reared when Kahlan stabbed them with her lance, many oftheir riders fell. Some were injured from the fall onto scattered equipment orthe frozen ground, but most came under the swarming attack of the D’Harans.From atop his Imperial Order warhorse, General Meiffert commanded his men toform a defensive line. After directing them into place, he charged off, roaringa string of orders as he went. He didn’t tell his men who to protect, so as notto betray Kahlan to the enemy, but they quickly saw what it was he intended themto do. D’Harans grabbed up the enemy lances, or came running with their ownpikes, and soon there was a bristling line of steel-tipped pole weaponspresenting a deadly obstacle to any approaching cavalry.Kahlan called out orders to men on either side, and, as she joined the line,commanded them into position to block an Imperial Order cavalry unit of abouttwo hundred who were trying to make good their escape. The enemy might have beenemulating the raids the D’Haran cavalry had made on the Imperial Order’s camp,but Kahlan wasn’t about to allow them to succeed at it. She intended them tofail.The enemy’s horses balked when they encountered a solid line of advancing pikesbrandished by men shouting battle cries. Soldiers coming from behind the Ordercavalry rained down arrows. D’Harans dragged trapped riders from their saddles,down into the bloody hand-to-hand fighting on the ground.“I don’t want one of them escaping camp alive!” she yelled to her men. “Nomercy!”“No mercy!” every D’Haran within earshot called out in answer.The enemy, so confident and arrogant as they had charged in, relishing theprospect of spilling D’ Haran blood, were now nothing more than pathetic men inthe ungainly grip of despair as the D’Harans hacked them to death.Kahlan left the soldiers with the lances and pikes, now that a defensive linehad been established and the enemy was trapped, and ran back through the firesand choking smoke to find Verna, Adie, and Cara. She had to dodge woundedsoldiers of both armies on the ground. The fallen attackers who still had fightin them snatched at her ankles. She had to stab several who tried to rise up tograb her. Others afoot who suddenly appeared, she had to cut down.The enemy knew who she was, or at least they were pretty sure. Jagang had seenher, and no doubt had described the Mother Confessor to his men. Kahlan was sureto have a heavy price on her head.There seemed to be Imperial Order men scattered throughout the camp. She doubtedthere had been an attack by foot soldiers; they were probably cavalrymen who hadlost their mounts. Horses were often easier moving targets to hit with arrowsand spears than were men. In the gathering darkness it was hard to make outenemy soldiers. They were able to sneak through the camp undiscovered as theyhunted targets of value, such as officers, or maybe even the Mother Confessor.When the lurking enemy spotted Kahlan making her way through the chaos, theycame out from their hiding places to go after her with wild abandon. Others, shecame upon and surprised. Remembering not only her father’s training, butRichard’s admonition, Kahlan cut fiercely into the enemy soldiers. She gave themno opening; no chance; no mercy.Her training under her father had been a good foundation for the esoterictactical precepts that Richard had taught her when she was recovering from herwounds back in Hartland. Richard’s way had seemed so strange, then; now, itseemed so natural. In much the same way a lighter horse could outmaneuver a bigwarhorse, her lighter weight became her edge. She didn’t need the weight becauseshe simply didn’t clash with the enemy in the traditional manner, as theyexpected. She was a hummingbird, floating out of their reach, swooping inbetween their ponderous moves to efficiently deliver death.Such moves were not at odds with the manner of fighting that her father hadtaught, but complemented it in a way that fit her. Richard had trained her notwith a sword, but with a willow switch, a mischievous smile, and a dangerousglint in his eyes. Now, Richard’s sword, strapped over the back of her shoulder,was an everpresent reminder of those playful lessons that had been not onlyunrelenting, but deadly serious.She finally found Verna, bent over Cara, but didn’t see the general anywhere.Kahlan snatched Verna’s sleeve.“How is she?”“She threw up, but that seemed to have helped, once it passed. She will probablybe woozy for a while, but I think she’s otherwise all right.”I “She has a thick skull,” Adie said. “It not be cracked, but she should liestill for a time-at least until she recovers her balance.”Cara’s hands groped as if having trouble finding the ground beneath her. Despiteher obvious dizziness, she was cursing the Prelate and trying to sit up. Kahlan,squatting beside Cara, pressed her shoulder to the ground.“Cara, I’m right here. I’m fine. Lie still for a few minutes.”“I want at them!”“Later,” Kahlan said. “Don’t worry, you’ll get your chance.” She saw that theblood was cleaned from Adie’s head. “Adie, how are you? How is your head?”The old sorceress gestured dismissively. “Bah. I be fine. My head be thickerthan Cara’s.”Soldiers had gathered, forming a protective wall of steel. Verna, Adie, andKahlan crouched over Cara, keeping an eye on the surrounding area, but thefighting immediately around them seemed to have ended. Even if pockets of battleremained, with the large number of D’Haran soldiers who had protectively closedranks, the four women were safe for the time being.General Meiffert finally returned, charging through the line of D’Harandefenders as they parted for him. He leaped from his enemy warhorse. The horsetossed his head at the indignity of being ridden by the enemy, and ran off. Theyoung D’Haran general crouched down on the opposite side of Cara. Winded, hestarted talking anyway.“I’ve been down checking with the front lines. This is a raid, much like whatwe’ve been doing to them. It looked bigger than it really was. When they spottedthe Mother Confessor, they called their men into this area, so the damage wasmostly focused in this section.”“Why didn’t we know?” Kahlan asked. “What went wrong with the alarm?”“Not sure.” He was shaking his head, still getting his breath. “Zedd thinks thatthey learned our codes, and that when we blew the alarm, they must have usedSubtractive Magic to alter the magic woven into the sound that tells our giftedthat it’s a real attack.”Kahlan let out an angry breath. It was all starting to make sense to her.“That’s why there have been so many false alarms. They were numbing us to themso that when they attacked, we would be unconcerned, falsely believing our ownalarms were just another enemy false alarm.”“I’m guessing you’re right.” He flexed his fist in frustration. He looked downthen and noticed Cara scowling up at him. “Cara. Are you all right? I was so-Imean, we thought you might be badly hurt.”“No,” she said, casting a cool glare at Verna and Kahlan, each of whom used ahand to hold her shoulders down. She casually crossed her ankles. “I justthought you could handle it, so I decided to take a nap.”General Meiffert gave her a quick smile and then turned a serious face toKahlan.“It gets worse. This cavalry attack was a diversion. They hoped it might getyou, I’m sure, but it was meant to make us believe it was just a raid.”Kahlan felt her flesh go cold with dread. “They’re coming, aren’t they?”He nodded. “The entire force. They’re still a distance out, but you’re right,they’re coming. This was just to throw us into confusion and keep usdistracted.”Kahlan stared, dumbfounded. The Order had never attacked at sunset before. Theprospect of the onslaught of hundreds of thousands upon hundreds of thousands ofImperial Order troops storming in from the darkness was bloodcurdling.“They’ve changed their tactics,” Kahlan whispered to herself. “He’s a quickstudy. I thought I’d tricked him, but I was the one who was taken in.”“What are you mumbling about?” Cara asked, her fingers locked together over herstomach.“Jagang. He counted on me not being fooled by those troops going around in acircle. He wanted me to think I had outsmarted him. He played me for a fool.”Cara made a face. “What?”Kahlan felt sick at the implications. She pressed a hand to her forehead as theawful truth inundated her.“Jagang wanted me to think I had his scheme figured out, so we would pretend toplay along and send out our troops. He probably figured they wouldn’t be sentafter his decoy, but would be used instead against his real plan of attack. Hedidn’t care about that, though. All along, he was planning on changing histactics. He was waiting only until those troops left so that he could attackbefore they were in place and while our numbers were reduced.”“You mean,” Cara asked, “that whole time you were talking to him, pretending tobelieve he was moving troops north, he knew you were pretending?”“I’m afraid so. He outsmarted me.”“Maybe, maybe not,” General Meiffert said. “He hasn’t succeeded, yet. We don’thave to let him have it his way. We can move our forces before he can pounce.”“Can’t we call back the men we sent out?” Verna asked. “Their numbers wouldhelp.”“They’re hours away,” General Meiffert said, “traveling through back country onthe way to their assigned locations. They would never get back here in time tohelp us tonight.”Rather than dwell on how gullible she had been, Kahlan put her mind to theimmediate problem. “We need to move fast.”The general nodded his agreement. “We could fall back on our other plansaboutbreaking up and scattering into the mountains.”He ran his fingers back through his blond hair. The gesture of frustrationunexpectedly reminded Kahlan of Richard. “But if we do that, we would have toabandon most of our supplies. In winter, without supplies, a number of our menwouldn’t last long. Either way, killed in battle or dying of hunger andcold-you’re just as dead.”“Broken up like that, we would be easy pickings,” Kahlan agreed. “That’s a lastresort. It may work later, but not now. For now, we need to keep the armytogether if we’re to survive the winter-and if we’re to keep the Orderdistracted from its designs at conquest.”“We dare not allow them to go uncontested into a city. It would not only be abloodbath, but if they picked the right city, we would face a near impossibletask of dislodging them.” The general shook his head. “It could end up being theend of our hopes of driving them back to the Old World.”Kahlan gestured over her shoulder. “What about that valley we talked about, backthere? The high pass is narrow-it can be defended on this side by two men and adog, if need be.”“That’s what I was thinking,” he said. “It keeps the army together-and keeps theOrder having to contend with us, rather than being able to turn their attentionon any cities. If they try to move around us up into the Midlands, there areeasy northern routes out of the valley from which we can strike. We have moremen on the way, and we can send for others; we need to stay together andmaintain our engagement with the Order’s army until those forces arrive.”“Then what are we waiting for?” Verna asked. “Let’s get moving.”He gave her a worried look. “The problem right now is that if we’re to make itinto that valley before the Order can pounce on us, we’re going to need moretime to do it. The pass is too narrow for wagons. The horses can make it, butnot the wagons-they’ll have to be dismantled. Most of our equipment is designedto be knocked down so the parts can be portaged, if need be. We’ll have to leavea few that aren’t. It won’t take long to get started, but we’re going to needtime to funnel all the men and supplies over that narrow pass-especially in thedark.”“Torches will work well enough with a steady line of men,” Adie said. “They mustonly follow the one in front, and even if the fight be bad, they can do it.”Kahlan remembered the handprint made of glowing dust. “The gifted could lay downa glowing track to guide the men.”“That would help,” the general said. “We’re still left with our basic problem,though. While our men are trying to break down and move all our equipment andsupplies, and waiting their turn to go over the pass, the Order will arrive.We’ll find ourselves in a pitched battle trying to defend ourselves whilewithdrawing at the same time. A withdrawal requires the ability to move fasterthan the enemy, or at least keep him at bay while pulling back; the pass doesn’tprovide that.”“We’ve kept ahead of them before,” Verna said. “This isn’t the first attack.”“You’re right.” He pointed to his left. “We could try to withdraw up thisvalley, instead, but in the dark and with the Order attacking, I think thatwould be a mistake. Darkness is the problem, this time. They’re going to keepcoming. In daylight, we could establish defenses and hold them off-not atnight.”“We already have defenses set up, here,” Cara said. “We could stand where we areand fight them head-on.”General Meiffert chewed his lower lip. “That was my first thought, Cara, andstill an option, but I don’t like our chances in a head-on, direct confrontationlike this, not at night when they can sneak great numbers of men in close. Wecouldn’t use our archers to advantage in the dark. We can’t see their numbers ormovements accurately, so we wouldn’t be able to position our men properly. It’sa problem of numbers: theirs are almost unlimited, ours aren’t.“We don’t have enough gifted to cover every possibility-and in war it’s alwayswhat you don’t cover that gets hit. The enemy could pour through a gap, get inbehind us in the dark, without us even realizing it, and then we’re finished.”Everyone was silent as the implications truly sank in.“I agree,” Kahlan said. “The pass is the only chance we have to keep from losinga major battle tonight-along with a huge number of our men. The risk withoutreal benefit of standing and fighting is a poor choice.”The general appraised her eyes. “That still leaves us with the problem of howwe’re going to get over that pass before they annihilate us.”Kahlan turned to Verna. “We need you to slow the enemy down to give us the timewe need to get our army over that pass.”“What do you wish me to do?”“Use your special glass.”The general screwed up his face. “Her what?”“A weapon of magic,” Cara said. “To blind the enemy troops.”Verna looked thunderstruck. “But I’m not ready. We only made up a small batch.I’m not ready.”Kahlan turned back to the general. “What did the scouts say about how much timewe have until the Order is upon us?”“The Order could be here within an hour, at the soonest, two at the latest. Ifwe don’t slow them down, we’ll never make it out of this valley with our men andsupplies. If we can’t find a way to delay them, we can only run for the hills,or stand and fight. Neither is a choice I would make except in desperation.”“If we just run for the hills,” Adie said, “we be as good as dead. Together, webe alive and at least be a threat to the enemy. If we scatter, the Order willtake the opportunity to attack and capture cities. If our only choice is toscatter, or stand our ground and fight, then we can only choose to stand andfight. Better to try, than to die one at a time out in the mountains.”Kahlan rubbed her fingers across her brow as she tried to think. Jagang hadchanged his tactics and decided to engage them in a night battle. He had neverdone that before because it would be so costly for him, but with his numbers, heapparently wasn’t concerned about that. Jagang held life in little regard.“If we have to fight him, in a full battle, here, now,” Kahlan said inresignation, “we will probably lose the war by dawn.”“I agree,” the general finally said. “As far as I see it, we have no choice. Wehave to act quickly and get as many of our men over the pass as we can. We’lllose all those who don’t get over before the Order arrives, but we’ll manage topreserve some.”The four of them were silent a moment, each considering the horror of thatreality, of who would remain behind to die. Furious activity continued aroundthem. Men were rushing around, putting out fires, collecting panicked horses,tending to wounded, and battling the few remaining invaders they had trapped.The Order soldiers were greatly outnumbered. Not for long, though.Kahlan’s mind raced. She couldn’t help being furious with herself at beinggulled. Richard’s words echoed through her mind: think of the solution, not theproblem. The solution was the only thing that mattered now.Kahlan looked again to Verna. “We have an hour before they’re upon us. You haveto try, Verna. Do you think you have any chance at making your special glass andthen deploying it before the enemy is upon us?”“I will do my best-you have my word on that. I wish I could promise more.” Vernascrambled to her feet. “I’ll need the Sisters who are tending the wounded, ofcourse. What about the ones working at the front lines? The ones counteringenemy magic? Can I have any of them?”“Take them all,” Kahlan said. “If this doesn’t work, nothing else is going tomatter.”“I’ll take them all, then. Every one,” Verna said. “It’s the only chance wehave.”“You get started,” Adie told Verna. “Go down near the front lines, on this sideof the valley where you will be upwind from the attack. I will begin collectingthe Sisters and get them down there to help you.”“We need glass,” Verna said to the general. “Any kind. At least a few barrelsfull.”“I’ll have men down there with the first barrel right away. Can we at least helpto break it up for you?”“No. It won’t matter if what you throw in the barrels breaks, but beyond that,it must be done by the gifted. Just bring whatever glass you can collect, thatwill be all you can do.”The general promised her he would see to it. Holding her hem up out of her way,Verna ran off to the task. Adie was close on her heels.“I’ll get the men moving now,” the general told Kahlan as he scrambled to hisfeet. “The scouts can mark the trail; then we can start moving the heaviersupplies first.”If it worked, they would slip out of Jagang’s grasp.Kahlan knew that if Verna failed, they could all very well lose their lives, andthe war, by morning. General Meiffert paused with one last hesitant look, onelast chance for her to change her mind.“Do it,” she said to the general. “Cara-we have work.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 38Kahlan pulled her horse up short. She felt the heat of blood rushing to herface. “What are you doing?” Cara asked as Kahlan threw her leg over the horse’sneck and leaped to the ground.The moon lit a layer of lacy clouds scudding past, giving a faint, sereneillumination to the surrounding countryside. The thin layer of snow gathered themuted light of the moon to make it more luminous than it otherwise would be.Kahlan pointed in the direction of the small figure she could just make out inthe dim light. The skinny girl, surely not much past ten years, was standing ata barrel, ramming a metal rod down inside to smash the glass in the bottom.Kahlan handed the reins to Cara as soon as she had dismounted.Kahlan stalked over to the Sisters working on the snowy ground. Running off in ahaphazard line, to keep the wind at their backs, were over a hundred of thewomen, all focused intently on the work before them. Many had their cloakstented around themselves and their work.Not far down that line, Kahlan bent, put a hand under the Prelate’s arm, andlifted her to her feet. Mindful of the serious nature of the work going on,Kahlan at least kept her voice quiet, since she wasn’t able to make itcongenial.“Verna, what is Holly doing down here?”Verna glanced over the heads of a dozen intervening Sisters kneeling before along board, breeze at their backs, carefully griding glass chips with pestles inmortars. There being not nearly enough pestles and mortars, many of the women tothe other side were using dished rocks and round stones to carefully crunch theglass chips. The concentration showed on each woman’s face. The accident thathad blinded a Sister had happened when the wind had changed, and a gust hadblown her work back up in her face. The same thing could happen again at anytime, although, as darkness had settled in, the wind had at least died down to asteady breeze.Holly was bundled in an oversized cloak. She had a determined grimace as shelifted the rod and then let it drop down in the barrel set away from theSisters’ dangerous work. Kahlan saw that the rod had a faint greenish glow toit.“She’s helping, Mother Confessor.”“She’s a child!”Verna pointed off into the darkness, to what Kahlan hadn’t seen. “So are Helenand Valery.”Kahlan pinched the bridge of her nose between her first finger and thumb andtook a purging breath. “What madness would possess you to have children downhere near the front helping to-to blind people?”Verna glanced at the women working nearby. She took Kahlan’s arm by the elbowand led her out of earshot of the others. Alone, where they were less likely tobe heard, she folded her hands before herself as she assumed the stern visagethat came so naturally to her.“Kahlan, Holly may be a child, but she is a gifted child, and she is far fromstupid besides. That goes for Helen and Valery as well. Holly has seen more inher young life than any child should see. She knows what’s going on tonight,with that attack, and with the attack that’s coming. She was terrified-all thechildren were.”“So you bring her to the front-to the greatest danger?”“What would you have me do? Send her back somewhere to be watched over bysoldiers? Do you wish me to force her to be alone at a time like this so shecould only tremble in terror?”“But this is-”“She’s gifted. Despite how horrific it seems, this is better for her, as it isfor the others. She’s with the Sisters, who understand her and her ability asother people can’t. Don’t you recall the comfort you derived from being witholder Confessors who knew the way you felt about things?”Kahlan did, but said nothing.“The Sisters are the only family she and the other novices have, now. Holly isnot alone and afraid. She may still be afraid, but she’s doing something to helpus, so that her fear is channeled into something that will assist in overcomingthe cause of her fear.”Kahlan’s brow was still set in a glare. “Verna, she’s a child.”“And you had to kill a child today. I understand. But don’t let that terribleevent make it harder on Holly. Yes, this is an awful thing she is helping to do,but this is the reality of the way things are. She could die tonight, along withthe rest of us. Can you even imagine what those brutes would do to her, first?At least that much is beyond the imagination of her young mind. What she cancomprehend, though, is fear enough.“If she wanted to hide somewhere, I would have let her, but she has a right-ifshe so chooses-to contribute to saving herself. She is gifted and can use herpower to do the simple part of what needs doing. She begged me to give her thechance to help.”In anguish, Kahlan gathered her fur mantle at her throat as she glanced backover her shoulder at the little girl using both her spindly arms to lift theheavy steel rod and drop it again to break the glass in the bottom of thebarrel. Holly’s features were drawn tight as she concentrated on using her giftwhile at the same time lifting the weight of the rod.“Dear spirits,” Kahlan whispered to herself, “this is madness.”Cara impatiently shifted her weight to her other foot. It wasn’t indifference tothe situation, but a matter of priorities. Madness or not, there was little tineleft, and, as Verna said, they could all die before the night was finished. Ascruel as it sounded, there were more important matters than the life of onechild, or, for that matter, three.“How is the work going? Are you going to be ready?”Verna’s bold expression finally faltered. “I don’t know.” She lifted a handhesitantly, motioning out over the dark valley before them. “The wind is right,but the valley approach to our forces is quite broad. It’s not that we won’thave some, it’s that we need to have enough so that when the enemy gets close,we can release the glass dust to float across the span of the entire field ofbattle.”“But you have some. Surely, what you have will do damage to the enemy.”“If there isn’t enough, then they may skirt it, or it may not be concentratedenough to do the damage necessary to bring their forces to a halt. Their attackwill not be turned back by a small number of casualties.” Verna squeezed onefist in her other hand. “If the Creator will just slow the Imperial Order enoughto grant us another hour, at the least, then I believe we may have enough.”Kahlan wiped a hand across her face. That was asking a lot, but with thedarkness, she thought that it just might be possible that the Order would haveto go slow enough to give Verna and her Sisters the time they needed.“And you’re sure we can’t help? There is nothing any but the gifted can do toassist you?”Verna’s mask of authority again emerged in the moonlight.“Well, yes, there is one thing.”“What is it, then?”“You could leave me alone so I can work.”Kahlan sighed. “Just promise me one thing.” Verna raised an eyebrow as ifwilling to listen prudently. “When the attack comes, and you have to use thisspecial glass, get the children out of here first? Get them to the rear, wherethey can be taken over the pass to safety.”Verna smiled with relief. “We are of like minds in that, Mother Confessor.”As Verna hurried back to her work, Kahlan and Cara returned along the line ofSisters, past the end to where Holly was preparing glass to supply those giftedwomen. Kahlan couldn’t help but to stop for a word.“Holly, how are you getting along?”When the girl rested the rod against the side of the barrel, Cara, absent anyfondness for magic, aimed a suspicious frown at the faintly glowing metal. AsHolly took her small hands from the metal, the greenish glow faded, as if amagical wick had been turned down.“I’m fine, Mother Confessor. Except I’m cold. I’m getting terribly tired ofbeing cold.”Kahlan smiled warmly as she ran a gentle hand down the back of Holly’s finehair. “As are we all.” Kahlan crouched down beside the girl. “When we get overinto another valley, you can get warm by a nice fire.”“That would be splendid.” She cast a furtive glance at her steel rod. “I have toget back to work, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan couldn’t resist pulling the girl close and kissing her frigid cheek.Hesitant at first, the thin little arms surrendered to desperately encircleKahlan’s neck.“I’m so scared,” Holly whispered.“Me too,” Kahlan whispered back as she squeezed the girl tight. “Me too.”Holly straightened. “Really? You get scared, too, that those awful men willmurder us?”Kahlan nodded. “I get frightened, but I know we have a lot of good people whowill keep us safe. Like you, they work as hard as they can so that we can allsomeday be safe, and not have to be scared anymore.”The girl stuck her hands under her cloak to warm them. Her gaze sank to theground at her feet. “I miss Ann, too.” She looked up again. “Is Ann safe?”Kahlan groped for words of comfort. “I saw Ann not long ago, and she was fine. Idon’t think you need worry for her.”“She saved me. I love her and miss her so. Will she be with us, soon?”Kahlan cupped the girl’s cheek. “I don’t know, Holly. She had important businessshe was taking care of. I’m sure, though, that we’ll see her again.”Pleased with that news and seemingly relieved to know that she was not alone inher fears, Holly turned back to her work with renewed determination.As Kahlan and Cara collected their horses, they heard a horse approaching at agallop. Before she recognized the rider, Kahlan saw and recognized the blacksplotch on its rump. When he saw her waving, Zedd trotted Spider around to her.He slid down off the animal’s bare back.“They’re coming,” the wizard announced without preamble.Verna rushed up, having seen Zedd ride in. “It’s too soon! They weren’t supposedto be here this soon!”He gaped at her in astonishment. “Bags, woman, shall I tell them that it wouldbe rather inconvenient for them to attack right now and to please come back tokill us later?”“You know what I mean,” she snapped. “We don’t have enough, yet.”“How long till they get here?” Kahlan asked.“Ten minutes.”That thin sliver of time was the only bulwark between them and catastrophe.Kahlan felt as if her heart rose into her throat, recalling suddenly theforsaken feeling of being mobbed and beaten to death. Verna sputtered inwordless frustration, anger, and dread.“Do you have any ready?” Zedd asked as calmly as if he were inquiring aboutdinner.“Yes, of course,” she said. “But if they will be here that soon, we’ve notenough. Dear Creator, we don’t have nearly what we’ll need in order to drift itout all across the front. Too little is as good as none.”“We’ve no choice, now.” Zedd gazed off into the darkness, perhaps seeing whatonly a wizard could see. His jaw was set in bitter disappointment. He spoke in adisembodied voice, a man going through the motions when he knew he had come tothe end of his options, perhaps even his faith. “Start releasing what you have.We’ll just have to hope for the best. I have messengers with me; I’ll send wordof the situation back to General Meiffert. He will need to know.”-To see Zedd seemly relinquish hope cast their fate in the most frightening lightpossible. Zedd was always the one who kept them focused and gave them courage,conviction, and confidence. He gathered up Spider’s reins in one hand andgripped her mane with the other.“Wait,” Kahlan said.He paused and looked back at her. His eyes were a window into an innerweariness. She couldn’t imagine all the struggles he had faced in his life, oreven in the last few weeks. Kahlan ran through seemingly a thousand thoughts asshe searched frantically for some way of turning away their grim fate.Kahlan couldn’t let Zedd down. He had so often carried them; now he neededanother shoulder to help endure the weight. She presented him a look of fiercedetermination before she turned to the Prelate.“Verna, what if we didn’t release it in the way we planned? What if we didn’tsimply let it drift out, hoping for the breeze to. carry it where we need it?”Verna opened her hands in a bewildered gesture. “What do you mean?”“Won’t it take more of the glass-the amount you say you need-simply so thatthere is enough to let it drift all the way across the valley, and yet haveenough to hang in the air, too?”“Well . . . yes, of course, but-”“What if,” Kahlan asked, “we released it in a line along the face of the front?Right where it was needed. Then it would take less, wouldn’t it?”“Well I suppose.” Verna threw up her hands. “But I told you, we can’t use magicto help us or they will detect our conjuring and then they will shield for theglass as fast as we release it. It will be useless. Better to release what wehave and hope for the best.”Kahlan glanced out over the empty plain faintly lit by the placid clouds veilingthe moon. There was nothing to be seen out in the valley. Soon, there would be.Soon, the virgin snow would be trampled by the boots of over a million men.Only the sound of glass being crushed on stone and the thump of the steel rodsin the barrels disturbed the quiet darkness. Soon, bloodcurdling battle crieswould inundate the hush of the night.Kahlan felt the suffocating dread she had felt when she first realized that allthose men had caught her alone. She felt the anger, too.“Collect what you’ve made so far,” she said. “Let me have it.”They all stared at her.Zedd’s brow drew together in a wrinkled knot. “Just what are you thinking?”Kahlan pulled her hair back from her face as she rapidly pieced together herplan, so that it was whole in her own mind, first.“The enemy is attacking into the wind-not directly, but close enough for ourpurpose. I’m thinking that if I ride along the front of our line, right in frontof the advancing enemy troops, and I release the glass dust, letting it dribbleout as I go, then it will flow out in the wind behind me, right into the facesof the enemy. Delivering it right where it’s needed, it won’t take as much as itwould were we to let it drift out from here hoping to spread it all across thevalley.” She looked from one startled face to another. “Do you see what I’msaying? Closer to the enemy, wouldn’t it take much less to do the job?”“Dear Creator,” Verna protested, “do you have any idea how dangerous that wouldbe?”“Yes,” Kahlan answered in grim resolve. “A lot less dangerous than facing adirect attack by their entire force. Now, would that work? Wouldn’t it takeconsiderably less if I were to ride along the front, trickling it out as I went,than letting it drift out to them from here? Well? We’re running out of time.”“You’re right-it wouldn’t take nearly as much.” Verna touched her lip as shestared off into the darkness while considering. “It’s better than the way wewere going to do it, that much is sure.”Kahlan started pushing her. “Get it together. Now. Hurry.”Verna abandoned her protests and ran off to collect what they had. Cara wasabout to unleash a tirade of objections when Zedd lifted a hand as if to ask shelet him do the objecting, instead.“Kahlan, it sounds like you might have something here, but someone else can dothis. It’s foolish to risk-”“I’ll be needing a diversion,” she said, cutting him off. “Something to distracttheir attention. I’ll be riding by in the dark, so they probably won’t noticeme, but it would be best if there were something to occupy their attention, justin case, something to make them look elsewhere-for the last time.”“As I was saying, someone else can-”“No,” she said in quiet finality. “I’ll not ask someone else to do this. It wasmy idea. I’m doing it. I won’t allow someone to take my place.”Kahlan deemed herself responsible for the peril they were in. It was she who hadblundered and fallen for Jagang’s trick. It was she who had come up with theplan and ordered the troops out. It was she who made Jagang’s night attackpossible.Kahlan knew all too well the terror everyone felt, waiting for the attack. Shefelt it herself. She thought of Holly, fearful of being murdered by themarauding beasts coming out of the night for her. The fear was all too real.It would be Kahlan who had lost the war for them, this very night, if theydidn’t get their army back across that pass to safety.“I’m doing this myself,” she repeated. “That’s the way it’s going to be.Standing here arguing about it can only cost us our chance. Now, I need adiversion, and I need one quickly.”Zedd let out an angry breath. The fire was back in his eyes. He flicked out hishand, pointing. “Warren is back there waiting for me. The two of us will move toseparate locations and give you your diversion.”“What will you do?”At last, Zedd surrendered to a grim, cunning grin. “Nothing fancy, this time. Noclever devious tricks, like they no doubt expect. This time, we’ll give them agood old-fashioned firefight.”Kahlan gave a sharp tug to the strap at her ribs holding her leather armor onher shoulders, chest, and back, cinching it down tight. She nodded once to sealthe pact.“Wizard’s fire it is, then.”“Keep an eye to your right, to our side, as you ride. I don’t want you to get inthe way of what I mean for the enemy. You must also watch for what their giftedsend back at me.”As she secured her cloak, she nodded assent to Zedd’s brief instructions. Shechecked the straps on her leg armor, making sure they were tight, rememberinghow the enemy’s strong fingers had clawed at her legs, trying to unhorse her.Verna came-rushing back, a big bucket at the end of each arm pulled downstraight by the weight. Some of the Sisters were scurrying along beside her.“All right,” the winded Prelate said. “Let’s go.”Kahlan reached for the buckets. “I’ll take-”Verna yanked them back. “How do you propose to ride and sprinkle this out? It’stoo much. Besides, you don’t know its properties.”:’Verna, I’m not letting you-”“Stop acting like an obstinate child. Let’s go.”Cara snatched one of the buckets. “Verna is right, Mother Confessor. You can’thold on to your horse, release the glass dust, and carry both buckets all at thesame time. You two take that one, I’ll take this one.”The willowy Sister Philippa rushed to Cara’s side and lifted the bucket.“Mistress Cara is right, Prelate. You and the Mother Confessor can’t do bothbuckets. You two take one; Mistress Cara and I will take the other.”There was no time to argue with the three determined women. Kahlan knew that noone would be able to talk her out of what she had to do, and they probably feltthe same. Besides, they had a valid point.“All right,” Kahlan said as she pulled on her gloves.She lashed tight the fur mantle she wore over the top of the wool cloak. Shedidn’t want anything flapping in the wind. The hilt of her sword was covered,but she figured she wouldn’t be needing it. The hilt of Richard’s sword stuck upbehind her shoulder, her ever-present reminder of him-as if she needed one. Shequickly tied her hair back with a leather thong.Verna tossed a handful of the fluffy snow, checking the wind. It had held itsdirection and was light, but steady. At least that much was in their favor.“You two go first,” Kahlan said to Cara. “Verna and I will wait maybe fiveminutes to let what you release drift in toward the enemy, so that we won’t ridethrough it. Then, we’ll follow you across the valley. That way we’ll be sure tooverlap what you release with ours so as not to have any gaps. We need to makesure there’s no safe place for the Order to get through. We need the ruin andpanic to be as uniform and widespread as possible.”Sister Philippa, noting what Kahlan had done, fastened her cloak securely at herneck and waist. “That makes sense.”“It would be more effective doubled like that,” Verna agreed.“I guess there’s no time to argue this foolishness,” Zedd grumbled as he seizedSpider’s mane and pulled himself up, laying across the horse’s back on hisbelly. He swung a leg over Spider’s rump and sat up. “Let me have a minute ortwo to get ahead of you and let Warren know, then we’ll start showing theImperial Order some real wizard work.”He pulled his horse around and smiled. It was heartening to see it again.“After all this work, someone had better have some dinner waiting for me on theother side of that pass back there.”“If I have to cook it for you myself,” Kahlan promised.The wizard gave them a jaunty wave and galloped off into the darkness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 39Kahlan stuffed a boot in the stirrup, grabbed the saddle horn, and sprang upinto her seat. The cold leather creaked as she leaned over and held a hand downin order to help Verna up. Once the Prelate squirmed in close behind Kahlan, twoSisters carefully handed the heavy wooden bucket up to her. Cara and SisterPhilippa were on their horse and ready, the Sister balancing her bucket on herthigh.“Get the children back across the pass,” Verna ordered.Sister Dulcinia bobbed her head of gray hair. “I will see to it, Prelate.”“Whatever more of the glass you can have ready by the time the Mother Confessorand I ride out, you should release into the wind for good measure, then getyourselves spread out behind our lines to help if the Order breaks through. Ifwe fail, the Sisters must do their best to hold the enemy off while as many aspossible make it across the pass to safety.”Sister Dulcinia again promised to carry out the Prelate’s orders.They all waited a few minutes in silence while giving Zedd the head start heneeded to reach Warren with instructions. There seemed nothing else to say.Kahlan concentrated on what she had to do, rather than worrying whether or notit would work. In the back of her mind, though, she was aware of how notoriouslyimperfect were such last-minute battle plans.Judging that they had waited as long as they dared, Kahlan motioned with herarm, signaling Cara to start out. The two of them shared a last look. Caraoffered a brief smile, good luck-then raced away, Sister Philippa holding tightto the MordSith’s waist with one arm and balancing the bucket on her thigh withthe help of her other hand.As the sound of hoofbeats from Cara’s horse faded into the night, Kahlan for thefirst time realized that, in the distance, she could hear the collective yellsof hundreds of thousands of Imperial Order troops. The countless voices fusedinto one continuous roar as their attack drew ever closer. It almost soundedlike the moan of an ill wind through a canyon’s rocky fangs. Her horse snortedand pawed the frozen ground. The awful drone made Kahlan’s pulse race evenfaster. She wanted to race away, before the men got too close, but she had towait, to give the glass dust Cara and Sister Philippa released time to drift outof the way.“I wish we could use magic to protect ourselves,” Verna said in a quiet voice,almost as if in answer to what Kahlan was thinking. “We can’t, of course, orthey would detect it.”Kahlan nodded, hardly hearing the woman. Verna was just saying anything thatcame to mind so as not to have to sit and listen to the enemy coming for them.The bitter cold long forgotten, her heartbeat throbbing in her ears, Kahlan satstill as death, staring out into the empty night, trying to envision everyaspect of the task at hand, trying to go through it all in her mind first, soshe wouldn’t be surprised by anything that might happen and then have to decidewhat to do. Better to anticipate, if you could, than to react.As she quietly sat her horse, she let her anger build, too. Anger made a betterwarrior than fear.Kahlan fed that anger with images of all the terrible things she had seen theImperial Order do to the people of the Midlands. She let the memories of all thebodies she had seen pass through her mind, as if they came before the MotherConfessor to plead with stilled tongues for vengeance. She remembered the womenshe had seen wailing over murdered children, husbands, sisters, brothers,mothers and fathers. She remembered strong men in helpless anguish over thesenseless slaughter of their friends and loved ones. In her mind’s eye, she sawthose men, women, and children suffering at the hands of a people to whom theyhad done no harm.The Imperial Order was but a gang of killers without empathy. They merited nopity; they would get none.She thought about Richard in the hands of that enemy. She savored her promise tokill every one of them if she had to until she got Richard back.“It’s time,” Kahlan said through gritted teeth. Without looking back over hershoulder, she asked, “Are you ready?”“Ready. Don’t slow for anything, or we will end up its victims, too. Our onlychance is to keep fresh air streaming over us to carry the glass dust all awayfrom our bodies. When we get to the opposite side, after I’ve dumped it all,then we’ll be safe. By that time, the Order should be in a state of massconfusion, if not complete panic.”Kahlan nodded. “Hold tight. Here we go.”The horse, already in an excited state, probably from the approaching cries,sprang away too fast, nearly dumping Verna off the back. Her arm jerked tightaround Kahlan’s middle. At the same time, Kahlan reached back and caught Verna’ssleeve, holding her on. As they raced away and Verna fought to regain herbalance, the bucket lurched, but Verna was able to steady it. Fortunately, itdidn’t spill.Even as the muscular gelding was obeying her command and racing away, his earswere turned to the approaching clamor. He was skittish carrying the unfamiliarburden of two riders. He was well trained and had seen battle often enough, sohe probably was also edgy because he knew what the war cries signified. Kahlanknew he was strong and quick. For what she had to do, speed was life.Kahlan’s heart galloped as fast as the horse as they thundered through theblackness of the valley. The enemy was much closer, now, than they had been whenCara passed through not long before. The horse’s hoofbeats partly drowned outthe battle cries of countless enemy soldiers to their left.Terrifying bits of memories of fists and boots flashed unbidden into her mind asshe heard men coming toward her in the dark, screaming for blood. She felt hervulnerability as never before. Kahlan turned those memories from fear to angerat the outrage of these brutes coming into her Midlands and murdering herpeople. She wanted every one of them to suffer, and every one of them dead.There was no telling precisely how far the enemy had already advanced, or, withthe moonlight behind her, even her own exact direction. Kahlan worried that shemight have sliced it too close to the bone, and that they could unexpectedlyencounter a wall of bloodthirsty men. She wanted to be close, though, to deliverthe blinding dust right in their faces, to be sure it had the best chance towork, to turn back the attack. She resisted the urge to guide her horse to theright, away from the enemy.The night suddenly ignited with harsh yellow light. The clouds went from gray tobright yelloworange. White snow blazed with garish color. An awful droning soundvibrated deep under her ribs.A hundred feet in front of her and maybe ten feet above the ground, tumblingliquid yellow and blue light roared headlong across her route, dripping honeyedfire, trailing billowing black smoke. The seething sphere of wizard’s firevividly illuminated the ground beneath it as it shot past. Even though notdirected at her, the sound alone was enough to make Kahlan ache to cringe awayin dread.She knew enough about wizard’s fire, how it clung tenaciously to the skin, to bemore than wary of it. Once that living fire touched you, it couldn’t bedislodged. Even a single droplet of wizard’s fire would often eat through fleshdown to bone. There was no one either brave or foolish enough not to fear it.Few people touched by such conjured flame lived to recount the horror of theexperience. For those who did, revenge became a lifelong obsession.Then, in the light of that bright flame streaking across the valley floor,Kahlan caught sight of the horde, all with swords, maces, flails, axes, pikes,and lances raised in the air as they yelled their battle cries. The men, grim,daunting, fierce, were all in the grip of a wild lust for the fight as they ranheadlong out of the night.In the moonlight, Kahlan could see for the first time since she had joined upwith the army the full extent of the enemy forces. The reports had told thestory, but could not fully convey the reality of the sight. The numbers were sofar removed from her experience as to defy comprehension. Eyes wide, jaw hangingopen, she gasped in awe.Kahlan realized with alarm that the enemy was much closer than she had expected.Throughout the ocean of men, torches meant to be used to set fires sparkled likemoonlight off the vast sea flooding into the valley. At the horizon, thatmoonlight gleaming off uncountable weapons blurred into a flat line over whichshe almost expected to see ships sailing.The undulating leading edge, bristling shields and spears, threatened to closeoff her path. Kahlan used her right heel, back against her horse’s flank, toguide him a little to the right so as to clear the wave of soldiers. After shehad corrected his course, she thumped her heels against the animal’s ribs,urging him on.And then she realized, as arrows zipped past and spears plunged to the groundjust in front of her, that in the light of the wizard’s fire, the enemy couldsee her, too.The ball of wizard’s fire that had revealed her to the enemy wailed off into thedarkness, leaving her in shadow and lighting tens of thousands of men at a timeas it passed over their heads. Far in the distance, behind the advancing horde,the fire finally crashed to the ground, igniting a conflagration in the midst ofthe cavalry. Horsemen were often held back, ready to charge forth when their menencountered the D’Haran lines. The distant mortal screams of man and beast roseinto the night.An arrow skipped off her leather leg armor. More zipped past. One stuck in thesaddle just below her stomach as she leaned forward over the galloping horse’swithers. Apparently, in the moonlight they could still spot her and Verna racingpast.“Why aren’t they blind?” Kahlan called over her shoulder.She could see a cloud billowing out behind them. It looked little different thanthe dust the horse raised as it galloped, except Kahlan saw that it was comingfrom the bucket Verna rested against her thigh as she tipped it toward the enemylines, a little more, a little less, controlling the amount that poured out,keeping it in a steady stream. Cara had already been past, yet the men showed noill effect.“It takes a little while to work,” Verna said in Kahlan’s ear. “They have toblink a bit.”Fire raced past right behind them. Fiery droplets splashed down onto the snow,splattering when they hit, hissing like rain on hot stones round a fire. Thehorse snorted as he raced onward in near panic. As she leaned over his withers,Kahlan stroked his neck reassuringly, reminding him that he wasn’t alone.Kahlan let her gaze sweep along the advancing enemy line as she raced beforethem. She saw that the men were doing little blinking. Their eyes were wide intheir fervor for the coming battle.The wizard’s fire that had so spooked the horse from behind exploded through theenemy ranks. Liquid flames spilled across the mass of soldiers, touching off ashrill roar of ghastly cries. When burning men crashed into soldiers aroundthem, fire splashed onto them, too, spreading the horror. Around the fire, theadvancing line buckled. Yet other men running headlong through the nighttrampled those on the ground, only to lose their own footing and topple.Another sphere of wizard’s fire droned past to crash down, spilling its flamelike water from a burst dam. So massive was the eruption that the surge sweptmen away, carrying them off in a flaming current.A huge knot of fire erupted out of the enemy line not far in front of Kahlan,headed toward the D’Haran lines. Immediately, a small sphere of blue flameroared in from her right, meeting the ponderous globe of yellow flame in midair.The collision sent a shower of fire raining down around her as she rode past.Kahlan gasped and yanked the reins left as a fat gob of the plummeting firecrashed to the ground right before them, splattering flame everywhere.They missed the fire by inches, but she now found herself closing with the enemysoldiers at an alarming rate. Kahlan could read some of the obscene oaths ontheir lips. She spurred the terrified horse to the right. She turned a littlebut not enough to divert them from angling in toward the enemy lines.Glowing bits of fire rained down on the men as well as the open ground. Thehorse was running in a panic, too frightened to take direction from Kahlan. Thestench of burning leather was adding fuel to the horse’s fear. She glanced downand saw a bit of fire burning on the leather armor protecting her thigh. Thesmall but fierce flame fluttered wildly in the wind. She dared not try to brushthe glowing spot off lest it then stick to her hand. She feared to imagine whatit would feel like when it finally burned through the leather. She would have toendure the pain when it did; she had no choice.Verna didn’t realize what was happening. She was twisted sideways, stillreleasing the glass dust. Kahlan could see the plume of it carried away behindthem. The long trail curved, carried by the breeze, into the enemy, past thefront lines, back through the ranks of soldiers, off into the blackness. Fartherback in the Order’s ranks, the torches lit the cloud as it mingled with the dustchurned up from the frozen ground.An arrow nicked the horse’s shoulder and skipped up into the air. A surge ofmen, seeing her coming, ran with wild abandon in an effort to block her way.Kahlan yanked on the reins, trying to haul the powerful horse’s head to theright. In the grip of terror, the horse galloped on. She felt helpless as shetried to get it to turn. It was doing no good. They were headed right toward awall of men.“We’re getting too close!” Verna yelled in her ear.Kahlan was too busy to answer. Her arm was shaking with the effort of pulling onthe right rein, trying to turn the horse’s head over and to the right, but thehorse had the bit in his teeth and was stronger than she by far. Sweat trickleddown her neck. She stretched her right leg back and dug her heel into thehorse’s right flank to turn him. The men before them brought their pikes andswords around to bear. Fighting was one thing, but not having any control andjust watching her fate come at her was different.“Kahlan! What are you doing!”With the pressure of her heel in front of his right rear leg, she was finallyforcing the horse to turn. It wasn’t enough. She wasn’t going to be able todivert the runaway horse. The enemy looked like a steel porcupine rushing atthem.Three strides away, the horse lowered his head.“Good boy!” she cried.Maybe he had a chance to clear the pikes. Kahlan took her weight off the saddleand angled forward, flattening her back. She bent her arms, giving the reinsslack with her hands to either side of the horse’s neck. She kept pressure onhim with her lower legs, but let him have the freedom he needed.She didn’t know if it would work with the extra weight. If only the pikes wereshorter. Kahlan screamed for Verna to hold on.Wizard’s fire suddenly streamed past in front of them, coming in low. The menwho had rushed ahead in a line to block Kahlan’s way dove to the ground. Theentire line before them collapsed. The fire wailed past just over top of them,finally touching down off to Kahlan’s left. The cries of a thousand men filledher ears.The horse stretched his lowered head, getting his hocks underneath his body. Atthe last instant, his neck shortened and his head came up as he sprang upward,using his powerful hindquarters to launch himself. His back rounded as theysailed over the leading edge of men. Verna cried out, her arm like a hook aroundKahlan’s middle. They came down beyond the soldiers who had dropped flat. Withher weight on the stirrups, Kahlan used her legs to absorb the shock-Vernacouldn’t. With the extra load, the horse nearly stumbled as it landed, but kepthis balance and continued running. They were at last clear of the Ordersoldiers.“What’s the matter with you!” Verna yelled. “Don’t do that or I won’t be able tolet it out evenly!”“Sorry,” Kahlan called over her shoulder.Despite the cold wind in her face, sweat ran from her scalp. The Order soldiersseemed to fall away to their rear quarter. Giddy relief washed over her as sherealized they had made it past the bulge in the Imperial Order’s front lines.In the distance behind them, a storm of fire lit the night. Zedd and Warren wereshowing them a good old-fashioned firefight, as Zedd had put it. It was aterrifying demonstration, if insufficient to stop an enemy as large as theOrder. As the Order’s gifted raced to the scene and threw up shields, it limitedthe death and devastation. The two wizards had bought Kahlan and Verna the timethey had needed.Kahlan heard Cara calling “Whoa!” as she galloped up close.This time, with Cara’s horse heading them off, the lathered mount rapidly cameto a halt: The horse was exhausted, as was Kahlan. As they dismounted besideCara and Sister Philippa, Verna tossed the empty bucket to the ground. Kahlanwas glad it was dark, so that the others couldn’t see her legs trembling. Shewas relieved to see that the spot of fire had expended itself before burningthrough.The four of them watched as the night went mad with flame, most explodingagainst shields of magic, yet still doing damage to anyone too close. Zedd andWarren sent forth one tumbling sphere of fiery death after another. The cries ofmen could be heard all along the line. The fire was being returned, reapingdeath in the D’Haran lines, but the Sisters were throwing up their own shields.Still the vast enemy army advanced. At most, the deadly flames only slowed themand disrupted their orderly attack.As the gifted on both sides gained control, they managed to nullify each other’sfiery attacks. Kahlan knew that the forward D’Haran lines had no hope of holdingthe onrushing flood of the Order. They had no hope of even slowing them. In themoonlight, she could see them beginning to abandon their positions.“Why isn’t it working?” Kahlan whispered, half to herself. She leaned towardVerna. “Are you sure it was made properly?”Watching the enemy’s headlong rush, and in the din of battle cries, Verna didn’tseem to hear the question. Kahlan checked her sword. She realized how futile itwould be to try to fight. She felt Richard’s sword on her back, and considereddrawing it, but decided that it would be better to run. She pushed Verna, urgingher to their spent horse. Cara did the same with Sister Philippa.Before she stepped into the stirrup, Kahlan noticed the Order slowing. She sawmen stumbling. Some groped with outstretched arms. Others fell.Verna pointed. “Look!”An endless moan of frightened agony began rising up into the night, growing inintensity. Staggering men fell over one another. Some swung their swords at aninvisible enemy, hacking instead their blinded fellow soldiers.The progress of the men at the front slowed to a crawl. Soldiers kept coming,colliding with the stalled front line. Cavalry horses panicked, bucking offriders. Spooked horses ran off in every direction, oblivious of the men theytrampled. Racing wagons overturned. Confusion swept the enemy’s ranks.The advance buckled. The Imperial Order ground to a halt.Zedd and Warren rode up and dismounted, both sweating despite the frigid nightair. Kahlan gave Zedd’s bony hand a squeeze.“You two saved our necks at the end, there.”Zedd gestured to Warren. “Him, not me.”Warren shrugged. “I saw your predicament.”They all stared in wonder, watching the army gone blind.“You did it, Verna,” Kahlan said. “You and your glass saved us.”At last, she and Verna threw their arms around each other, tears of reliefcoursing down their cheeks."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 40Kahlan was one of the last to cross over the pass. The valley beyond was wellprotected by towering rock walls around the southern half. It was a long anddifficult route around those mountains if the Order had any thoughts ofattacking them here. While the troops of the D’Haran Empire had no intention ofletting themselves get trapped in that valley, for the time being it was a safeplace.Big old spruces filled the lap of the surrounding mountains, so they weresomewhat protected from the wind, as well. Tents carpeted the forest floor. Itwas good to see all the campfires and smell the woodsmoke-a sign that they weresafe enough for the men to have fires. The aroma of cooking filled thelate-night air, too. It had been a lot of work moving the army and theirequipment over the pass, and the men were hungry.General Meiffert looked as pleased as any general would when the army he fearedlost was at last safe-at least for the time being. He guided Kahlan and Carathrough the darkness dotted by thousands of campfires to tents he had set up forthem. Along the way, he filled them in on how everything with the army had gone,and ran through a list of what few things they had had to leave behind.“It’s going to be a cold night,” General Meiffert said when they had reached thetents he had set aside for them between two towering spruce. “I had a sack ofpebbles heated by a fire for you, Mother Confessor. You, too, Mistress Cara.”Kahlan thanked him before he left to see to his duties. Cara went off to go getsomething to eat. Kahlan told her to go ahead, that she just wanted to sleep.Inside her tent, Kahlan found Spirit standing on a little table, the lamphanging from the ridgepole lighting her proud pose. She paused to trace a fingerdown the flowing robes.Kahlan, her teeth chattering, could hardly wait to crawl into bed and pull thatsack of heated pebbles under the fur mantle with her. She thought about how coldshe was, and then instead of climbing into her bed, went back outside andsearched through the dark camp until she found a Sister. After following theSister’s directions, going between tents until she reached the area with thethick young trees, Kahlan found the small lean-to shelter set among the boughsfor protection from the wind and weather.She squatted down, peering inside at the bundle of blankets she could just makeout in the light coming from nearby campfires.“Holly? Are you in there?”A little head poked out. “Mother Confessor?” The girl was shivering. “What isit? Do you need me?”“Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Come with me please.”Holly climbed out, swaddled in a blanket. Kahlan took her little hand and walkedher back to her tent in silence. Holly’s eyes grew big and round as Kahlanushered in inside. Before the small table, the girl paused to stand still as astump while she stared in wonder at Spirit.“Like it?” Kahlan asked.Trembling with the cold, Holly reverently ran her frail fingers down Spirit’sarm. “Where ever did you get something so beautiful?”“Richard carved it for me.”Holly finally pulled her gaze from the statue and looked up at Kahlan. “I missRichard.” Kahlan could see Holly’s breath in the motionless air of the tent. “Hewas always nice to me. A lot of people were mean, but Richard was always nice.”Kahlan felt an unexpected stab of anguish. She hadn’t expected the subject toturn to Richard.“What was it you needed, Mother Confessor?”Kahlan turned her thoughts away from her sorrow and smiled. “I was proud of thework you did to help save us today. I promised you that you would be warm.Tonight, you will be.”The girl’s teeth were chattering. “Really?”Kahlan laid the Sword of Truth on the far side of the bed. She stripped off someof her heavier clothing, doused the lamp, and then sat down on the straw-filledpallet. Light from nearby campfires lent a soft glow to the tent’s walls.“Come. Climb into bed with me. It’s going to be very cold tonight. I need you tokeep me warm.”Holly only had to consider for a second.As Kahlan lay down on her side, she pulled Holly’s back against her stomach andthen drew the sack of heated pebbles up against the girl’s front. Holly huggedthe sack and moaned with the thrill of warmth. The satisfied moan made Kahlansmile.For a long time, she smiled, enjoying the simple pleasure of seeing Holly warmand safe. Having the girl there, holding her close, helped Kahlan to forget allthe terrible things she had seen that day.Far up in the mountains, a single wolf sang out in a long, lonely call. The cryechoed through the valley, trailing off, to be renewed again and again withforlorn persistence.With his sword at her back, Kahlan’s thoughts turned to Richard. Thinking abouthim, wondering where he was and if he was safe, she silently wept herself tosleep.The next day, snow moved down from the higher mountains to rampage across thesouthern regions of the Midlands. The storms raged for two days. The secondnight of the blizzard, Kahlan shared her tent with Holly, Valery, and Helen.They sat under blankets, ate camp stew, sang songs, told stories of princes andprincesses, and slept together to keep warm.When the snowstorm finally ended in a bleak golden sunrise, most of the tallertents had snow drifted to their eaves on their downwind side. The smaller oneswere completely covered over. The men dug themselves out, looking like so manywoodchucks come up out of their burrows for a peek.Over the next several weeks, the storms continued to roll past, dumping moresnow. In such weather, fighting, or even moving an army very far, was difficult.Scouts reported that the Imperial Order had withdrawn a week’s march back to thesouth.It would be a burden to care for blinded men. Within a days walk all around theplace where the special glass had been released, the D’Haran scouts reportedthat they had seen well over sixty thousand frozen corpses, now drifted overwith the snow-blind men unable to care for themselves in the harsh conditions.The Imperial Order had probably abandoned them to their fate. A few dozen of theblind had managed to make it over the pass, looking for help, begging for mercy.Kahlan had ordered them executed.It was hard telling the exact number blinded by Verna’s special glass; it couldbe that there were many who did in fact retreat with the Imperial Order, broughtalong to perform menial tasks. It was likely, though, that the corpses reportedby the scouts were the bulk of those blinded. Kahlan could imagine that Jagangmight not want them in his camp, using food and supplies, reminding his men oftheir stinging retreat.She knew, though, that for Jagang retreat was but a momentary setback and not areappraisal of his objectives. The Order had men enough to shrug off the loss ofthe hundred thousand killed since the fighting had started. For the time being,the weather prevented Jagang from striking back.Kahlan didn’t intend to sit and wait for him. A month later, when therepresentative from Herjborgue arrived, she met with him immediately in thesmall trappers’ lodge they had found up in the trees to the west side of thevalley. The lodge sat under the protection of towering, ancient pines, away fromthe open areas where the tents were congregated. The lodge had become Kahlan’sfrequent quarters, and often also served as their command center.It greatly relieved General Meiffert when Kahlan would stay in the lodge, ratherthan a tent. It made him feel as if the army was doing something about providingbetter accommodations for the Mother Confessor-the wife of Lord Rahl. Kahlan andCara did appreciate the nights they slept in the lodge, but Kahlan didn’t wantanyone to think she wasn’t up to the conditions the rest of them had to endure.Sometimes, she would instead have the girls sleep in the lodge along with someof the Sisters, and sometimes she insisted Verna sleep there with Holly, Valery,and Helen. It didn’t take a great deal of effort to persuade the Prelate.Kahlan greeted Representative Theriault from the land of Herjborgue, invitinghim into the cozy lodge. He was accompanied by a small guard unit, who waitedoutside. Herjborgue was a small country. Their contribution to the war effortwas in the area of their only product: wool. Kahlan had need of the man.After Representative Theriault knelt before the Mother Confessor, receiving thetraditional greeting, he at last stood and pushed his heavy hood back on hisshoulders. He broke into a broad grin.“Mother Confessor, so good to see you well.”She returned a sincere smile. “And you, Representative Theriault. Here, comeover by the fire and warm yourself.”By the stone fireplace, he pulled off his gloves and held his hands before thecrackling flames. He glanced to the gleaming hilt of the sword sticking upbehind her shoulder. His eye was caught by Spirit standing proudly on themantel. He stared in wonder, as did everyone who saw the proud figure.“We heard about Lord Rahl being captured,” he finally said. “Has there been anyword?”Kahlan shook her head. “We know they haven’t harmed him, but that’s about all. Iknow my husband; he’s resourceful. I expect he will find a way to get back tohelp us.”The man nodded, his brow furrowed as he listened earnestly.Cara, standing beside the table, reminded of her Lord Rahl by Kahlan’s words,idly rolled her Agiel in her fingers. Kahlan could tell by the look in Cara’sblue eyes, and by the way she casually let the weapon dangle once more by thesmall gold chain around her wrist, that the Agiel, being linked to the livingLord Rahl, still possessed its power. As long as it worked, they knew Richardwas alive. That was all they knew.The man opened his heavy traveling cloak. “How goes the war? Everyone anxiouslyawaits word.”“As near as we can figure, we’ve managed to kill over a hundred thousand oftheir troops.”The man gasped.-Such numbers were staggering to someone from a place as small ashis homeland of Herjborgue.“Then, they must be defeated. Have they run back to the Old World?”Rather than meet his gaze, Kahlan stared at the logs checkering in the waveringglow of the flames. “I’m afraid that losing that many men is hardly crippling tothe Imperial Order. We’re taking their numbers down, but they have an army ofwell over ten times that many. They remain a threat, a week’s march to the southof here.”Kahlan looked up to see him staring at her. She could tell by the look in hiseyes that he was having difficulty trying to imagine that many people. Hiswind-reddened face had paled considerably.“Dear spirits . . .” he whispered. “We’ve heard rumors, but to learn they aretrue . . .” With a despondent look, he shook his head. “How is it ever going tobe possible to defeat a foe of that size?”“Seems that I remember, a number of years back, you were in Aydindril to see theCouncil and you had a bit of trouble after a grand dinner. That big man fromKelton-I forget his name-was boasting and speaking ill of your small land. Hecalled you some name. Do you remember that night?-what he called you?”Representative Theriault’s eyes sparkled as he smiled.“Puny.,,“Puny. That was it. I guess he felt that because he was twice your size, thatmade him your better. I recall men clearing off a table, and the two of you armwrestling.”“Ah, well, I was younger back then, and I had a few glasses of wine with dinner,besides.”“You won.”He laughed softly. “Not by strength. He was cocky. I was clever, perhaps, andquick-that’s all.”“You won; that was the result. Those hundred thousand Order troops aren’t anyless dead because they outnumbered us.”The smile left his lips. “Point taken. I guess the Imperial Order ought to quitnow, while they have men left. I recall how those five thousand Galean recruitsyou led went after that force of fifty thousand, and eliminated them.” He leanedan arm on the rough-hewn mantel. “Anyway, I see your point. When you are facingsuperior strength, you must use your wits.”“I need your help,” Kahlan told the man.His big brown eyes reflected the firelight as they turned toward her. “Anything,Mother Confessor. If it be in my power to do, anything.”Kahlan bent and shoved another log onto the fire. Sparks swirled around beforeascending the chimney.“We need wool cloaks--hooded cloaks-for the men.”He considered only briefly. “Just tell me the numbers, and I will see to it. I’msure it can be arranged.”“I’ll need at least a hundred thousand-our entire force down here at present.We’re expecting more men any time, so if you could add half again that number,it would go a long way to helping destroy the Order.”As he went through mental calculations, Kahlan used the poker to set the new logto the back of the fire. “I know I’m not asking for something easy.”He scratched his scalp through his thick gray hair. “You’ve no need of hearinghow difficult it will be, that won’t help you win, so let me just say that youwill have them.”Representative Theriault’s word was a pledge as sound as gold, and as valuable.She stood and faced him.“And I want them made from bleached wool.”He lifted an eyebrow in curiosity. “Bleached wool?”“We need to be clever, as you can understand. The Imperial Order comes from farto the south. Richard was down there, once, and told me about how the weather isvery different than it is up here, in the New World. Their winters are nothinglike we have. If I don’t miss my bet, the Order is not familiar with winter, noris it used to surviving, much less fighting, in such weather. Winter conditionsmay be difficult, but this puts it to our advantage.”Kahlan made a fist before him. “I want to harry them mercilessly. I want to usethe winter weather to make them suffer. I want to draw them out make them haveto fight-in conditions they don’t understand as well as we do.“I want the hooded cloaks to help disguise our men. I want to be able to use theconditions to get in close on raids, and then disappear right before theireyes.”“They don’t have gifted?”“Yes, but they’re not going to have a sorceress telling every archer where toaim his arrow.”He stroked his chin. “Yes, I see your point.” He slapped the mantel as if toseal his promise. “I’ll have our people begin at once. Your men will need warmmittens, too.Kahlan smiled appreciatively. “They will be grateful. Have your people startsending the cloaks down to us as soon as they have some made. Don’t wait forthem all. We can start our raids with any number and add to them as you delivermore.”Representative Theriault pulled his hood up and fastened his heavy wool cloak.“Winter has just set in. The more time you have to whittle them down while youhave the advantage of weather, the better. I had best be on my way at once.”Kahlan clasped arms with the man-not something the Mother Confessor typicallydid, but something anyone else might do in sincere appreciation of aid.As she and Cara stood outside the door, watching the representative and hisguards trudging off through the snow, Kahlan hoped the supply of white cloakswould start arriving soon, and that they would be as effective as she hoped.“Do you really think we can press the war effectively in winter?” Cara asked.Kahlan turned back to the door. “We have to.”Before she went back inside, Kahlan caught sight of a procession coming upthrough the trees. When they were a little closer, she saw that it was GeneralMeiffert, on foot, leading. She was able to pick out Adie, Verna, Warren, andZedd, all walking along beside four riders. The midday sun sparkled off the hiltof the lead rider’s sword.Kahlan gasped when she saw who it was.Without bothering to go back inside to get her cloak or fur mantle, she raceddown through the snow to great him. Cara was right on Kahlan’s heels.“Harold!” she called out as she got closer. “Oh, Harold! Are we ever glad to seeyou!”It was her half brother, come from Galea. Kahlan then saw some of the other menriding behind him, and gasped again in surprise. Captain Bradley Ryan, commanderof the Galean recruits she had fought with was there, and his lieutenant, FlinHobson. She thought she recognized Sergeant Frost, in the rear. Her face hurtfrom grinning as she ran up to them through the deep snow.Kahlan wanted to pull her half brother off his horse and hug him. In a Galeanfield-officer uniform, far more muted than their dress uniform, he looked grandon his well-bred mount. She only now fully realized how worried she had beenover his late arrival.Carrying himself like the prince he was, Harold tipped his head to her as hebowed in his saddle. He offered only a small, private smile.“Mother Confessor. I’m gratified to find you well.”Captain Ryan was grinning, even if Prince Harold wasn’t. Kahlan had fondmemories of Bradley and Flin, of their bravery, courage, and heart. The fightinghad been horrifying, but the company of those fine soldiers, fine young men all,was a cherished memory. They had done the impossible before, and had come tohelp do it again.Standing beside his horse, Kahlan reached up for Harold’s hand. “Come inside.We’ve a good fire going.” She motioned to the captain, the lieutenant, and thesergeant. “You, too. Come inside and get warm.”Kahlan turned to the others, who didn’t look nearly as happy as Kahlan thoughtthey should. “We’ll all fit. Come inside.”Prince Harold stepped down out of the stirrup. “Mother Confessor, I-”Kahlan couldn’t resist. She threw her arms around her half brother. He was a bigbear of a man, much like their father, King Wyborn. “Harold, I’m so relieved tosee you. How’s Cyrilla?”Cyrilla, Harold’s sister and Kahlan’s half sister, was a dozen years older thanKahlan. Cyrilla had been ill for ages, it seemed. When she had been captured bythe Order she had been thrown into the pit with a gang of murderers and rapists.Harold had rescued her, but the abuse she suffered had left her in an incoherentstate, oblivious of those around her. She regained her senses only infrequently.When she came awake, she more often than not screamed and cried uncontrollably.One of the times when she was lucid, she had asked Kahlan to promise to be thequeen of Galea and keep her people safe.Harold, wishing to remain commander of the Galean army, refused the crown.Kahlan reluctantly had acceded to his wish.Harold’s eyes shifted to the others, briefly. “Mother Confessor, we need to havea talk.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 41At Prince Harold’s instructions, Captain Ryan and his two men went to see totheir troops and horses while the rest of them crowded into the small trapper’slodge. Zedd and Warren sat on a bench made of a board laid atop two log rounds.Verna and Adie sat against the opposite wall on another bench. Cara gazed outthe small window. Standing near Cara, General Meiffert watched as the prince rana finger back and forth along the front edge of the table. Kahlan folded herhands on the table before her.“So,” she began, fearing the worst, “how is Cyrilla?”Harold smoothed the front of his coat. “The queen has . . . recovered.”“Queen . . . ?” Kahlan rose out of her chair. “Cyrilla has recovered? Harold,that’s wonderful news. And she has at last taken her crown back? Even better!”Kahlan was delighted to be relieved of the role of queen to Galea. As MotherConfessor, it was an awkward duty better served by Cyrilla. More than that,though, she was relieved to learn that her half sister had finally recovered.While the two of them were never close, they shared a mutual respect.More than her cheer at Cyrilla’s recovery, though, Kahlan felt a sense ofdeliverance that Harold had at last brought his troops down to join with them.She hoped he had been able to raise the hundred thousand they had previouslydiscussed; it would be a good beginning for the army Kahlan needed to raise.Harold licked his weather-cracked lips. By the slump in his shoulders, she wassure that the task of collecting his army had been trying, and the journeyarduous. She had never seen his face looking so worn. He had a vague, empty lookthat reminded her of her father.Kahlan smiled exuberantly, determined to show her appreciation. “How many troopsdid you bring? We could certainly use the whole hundred thousand. That wouldjust about double what we have down here so far. The spirits know we need them.”No one was saying anything. As she looked from one person to the next, no onewould meet her gaze.Kahlan’s sense of relief was sloughing away.“Harold, how many troops did you bring?”He ran his meaty fingers back through his long, thick, dark hair. “About athousand.”She stared dumbly, sinking back into her chair. “A thousand?”He nodded, still not meeting her eyes. “Captain Bradley and his men. The onesyou led and fought beside, before.”Kahlan could feel her face heating. “We need all your troops. Harold, what’sgoing on?”He at last met her gaze.“Queen Cyrilla refused my plan to take our troops south. Shortly after you werethere and visited her, she came out of her illness. She was herself again-fullof ambition and fire. You know what she was like. She was always tireless in heradvocacy for Galea.” His fingers idly tapped the table. “But I’m afraid she hasbeen changed by her infirmity. She fears the Imperial Order.”“So do I,” Kahlan said with quiet bottled rage. She could feel Richard’s swordpressed against the back of her shoulder. She saw Harold’s eyes take it in.“Everyone in the Midlands fears the Order. That is why we need those troops.”He was nodding as she spoke. “I told her all that. I did. She said that she isQueen of Galea, and as such, she must put our land first.”“Galea has joined the D’Haran Empire!”He opened his hands in a helpless gesture. “When she was ill, she was . . .unaware of that event taking place. She said she only gave you the crown for thesafekeeping of her people, not to surrender their sovereignty.” His handsdropped to his sides. “She claims you never had any such authority and refusesto abide by the agreement.”Kahlan glanced at the others in the room, sitting mute, like a panel of grimjudges.“Harold, you and I have discussed all this in the past. The Midlands is underthreat.” She swept her arm out. “The entire New World is threatened! We mustturn back that threat, not take to defending one land at a time--or have eachland try to fend for itself. If we do that, we will all fall, one at a time. Wemust stand together.”“I agree with you, in principle, Mother Confessor. Queen Cyrilla does not.”“Then Cyrilla is not recovered, Harold. She is still sick.”“That may be, but it is not for me to say.”Elbow on the table, Kahlan rested her forehead against her fingertips. Thoughtswere screaming around inside her head, demanding that this not be happening.“What about Jebra?” Zedd asked from the side of the room. Kahlan was relieved tohear his voice, as if reason were returning to the lunacy of what she washearing, as if the weight of another voice would set things straight. “We leftthe seer there to help care for Cyrilla and to advise you. Surely, Jebra musthave advised Cyrilla against such actions.”Harold hung his head again. “I’m afraid that Queen Cyrilla ordered Jebra throwninto a dungeon. Moreover, the queen gave orders that if Jebra speaks one word ofher blasphemy-as Queen Cyrilla calls it-she is to have her tongue cut out.”Kahlan had to tell herself to blink. It was no longer Cyrilla’s behavior that sostunned her. Her words came sparse and brittle, the naked bones of dead respect.“Harold, why would you follow the orders of a madwoman?”His jaw took a set, as if injured by her tone. “Mother Confessor, she is notonly my sister, but my queen. I am sworn to obey my queen in order to protectthe Galean people. All those men of ours out there who have been fighting withyour army are also sworn to protect the people of Galea above all else. I’vealready given them our queen’s orders. We must all return to Galea at once. I’msorry, but that is the way it must be.”Kahlan pounded her fist on the table and shot to her feet.“Galea stands at the head of the Callisidrin Valley! It’s a gateway right up thecenter of the Midlands! Don’t you see what a tempting route it might be for theImperial Order? Don’t you see how they might want to split the Midlands?”“Of course I do, Mother Confessor.”She aimed a stiff arm, pointing at the camp beyond the lodge.“So you just expect all those men out there to put their lives between you andthe Order? You and Queen Cyrilla callously expect all those men out there to dieprotecting you?-while you sit back in Galea?-hoping they prevent the Order fromever reaching you?”“Of course not, Mother Confessor.”“What’s the matter with you! Don’t you see that if you fight with us to halt theOrder, you are protecting the people of your homeland?”Harold licked his lip. “Mother Confessor, all you say is probably true. It isalso irrelevant. I am commander of the Galean army. My entire life has beendevoted to serving the people of Galea and my sovereign-first my mother andfather, and then my sister. From the time I was a boy at my father’s knee, I wastaught to protect Galea above all else.”Kahlan did her best to control her voice. “Harold, Cyrilla is obviously stillsick. If you are honestly interested in protecting your people, you must seethat what you’re doing is not the way to accomplish it.”“Mother Confessor, I have been charged by my queen with protecting the people ofGalea. I know my duty.”“Duty?” Kahlan wiped a hand across her face. “Harold, you can’t blindly followthat woman’s whim. The route to life and liberty exists only through reason. Shemay be queen, but reason can be your only true sovereign. To fail to use reasonin this, to fail to think, is intellectual anarchy.”He looked at her as if she were some poor child who didn’t understand the worldof adult responsibility.“She is my queen. The queen is devoted to the people.”Kahlan drummed her fingers on the table. “What Cyrilla is, is deluded by ghoststhat still haunt her. She is going to bring harm to your people. You are goingto aid her in delivering your people into ruin because you wish something to betrue, even though it is not. You are seeing her as she once was, not as she isnow.”He shrugged. “Mother Confessor, I can understand why you think what you think,but it can change nothing. I must do as my queen commands.”Elbows on the table, Kahlan held her face in her hands for a time, tremblingwith anger at the insanity of what she was hearing. She finally looked up,meeting her half brother’s gaze.“Harold, Galea is part of the D’Haran Empire. Galea has a queen only at theindulgence of the Empire. Queen though she may be, even if she does notrecognize the rule of the D’Haran Empire, she is still, as she always has been,subordinate to the Mother Confessor of the Midlands. As Mother Confessor, aswell as the leader of the D’Haran Empire in Lord Rahl’s absence, I formallyterminate that indulgence. Cyrilla is now without authority and is removed fromoffice. She is no longer the queen of anything, much less Galea.“You are ordered to return to Ebinissia, to put Cyrilla under arrest for her ownprotection, to release Jebra, and to return to this army with the seer and allGalean forces except a home guard for the crown city.”“Mother Confessor, I’m sorry, but my queen has ordered-”Kahlan slammed the flat of her hand down on the table. “Enough!”He fell silent as Kahlan rose. With her fingertips pressed to the table, sheleaned closer to him.“As Mother Confessor, I am commanding you to carry out my orders at once. Thatis final. I will hear no more.”The room seemed gripped by the grave consequence of what was happening. Eachforbidding face watched, waiting to see how it was going to go.Harold spoke in a voice that reminded Kahlan of her father’s.“I realize that it may make no sense to you, Mother Confessor, but I must choosemy duty to my people above my duty to you. Cyrilla is my sister. King Wybornalways told me to run a good army. An officer must obey his queen. My men downhere are ordered by their queen to return at once to protect Galea. I am a manbound by my honor to protect my people, as ordered by my queen.”“You pompous fool. How dare you speak to me of your honor? You are sacrificingthe lives of innocent people to your delusions of honor. Honor is honesty towhat is, not blind duty to what you wish to be. You have no honor, Harold.”Kahlan sank into ‘her chair. She looked past him, to the side, staring into thehearth, into the flames.“I have given you my orders. Do you refuse to obey them?”“I must refuse, Mother Confessor. Let me say only that it is not out of malice.”“Harold,” she said in a flat tone without looking at him, “you are committingtreason.”“I realize that you may see it that way, Mother Confessor.”“Oh, I do. I do indeed. Treason to your people, treason to the Midlands, treasonto our D’Haran union against the Imperial Order, and treason against the MotherConfessor. What do you suppose I ought to do about it?”“I would expect that if you feel so strongly, you would have me put to death,Mother Confessor.”She looked up at him. “If you have enough sense to realize that, then what goodwill it do for you to stick to the orders of a madwoman? It will only bring yourdeath, and then you will not be able to carry out your queen’s orders. Stayingto your course can only leave your people without your aid, which is what youclaim to put above all else. Why not simply do the right thing and help us tohelp your people? Since you refuse, you have shown yourself, in truth, to bewithout common sense, much less honor.”His eyes turned to her, filled with smoldering anger. The knuckles of his fistswent white.“I will be heard, now, Mother Confessor. If I stand by my honor, even if itcosts me my life, it will be honoring my family, my sister, my queen, and myhomeland. A homeland forged by my father, King Wyborn, and my mother, QueenBernadine. When I was young, my father, my sovereign king, was taken from mymother, my family, and my homeland of Galea, by the Confessors, taken by aConfessor’s power for their selfish desire of a husband for your mother, for herselfish desire for a strong man to father her a child-you. Now, you, MotherConfessor-the daughter of that theft of that beloved man from us when I was buta boy-you would take me from my sister? ‘hake her, too, from our land? Take mefrom my duty to serve my queen, my land, and above all my people? The last dutymy father charged me with before your mother took him from us and destroyed himfor no reason but that he was good and she wanted him, was that I should alwayshonor my duty to my sister and my land. I will carry out my father’s last chargeto me, even if you think it madness.”Kahlan stared at him in cold shock.“I’m sorry you feel that way, Harold.”His face had aged and hardened. “I know that you are not responsible for allthat happened before you came to be, and I will always love that part of youthat is my father, but I am still the one who must live with it all. Now I mustbe true to myself, to my own feelings.”“Your feelings,” she repeated.“Yes, Mother Confessor. Those are my feelings, and I must put my faith in them.”Kahlan swallowed past the painful constriction in her throat. Her fingers, lyinglimply on the table before her, tingled.“Faith and feelings. Harold, you are as mad as your sister.”She drew herself up straight and folded her hands. She shared a last look withher half brother, a man she had never known, except in name, as she pronouncedsentence on him.“Beginning at sunrise tomorrow, the D’Haran Empire and Galea are at war. Aftersunrise tomorrow, if you are seen by me or any of our men, you will be put todeath for the crime of treason.“I will not allow those brave men out there to die for traitors. The ImperialOrder will, in all likelihood, turn north up the Callisidrin Valley. You will bealone. They will butcher every man in your army, just as they butchered thepeople of Ebinissia. Jagang will give your sister to his men, as a whore.“It will be by your doing, Harold, for refusing to use your ability to think,and instead following your feelings and faith in what does not exist.”Harold, hands clasped behind his back, chin held up, said nothing as Kahlancontinued.“Tell Cyrilla that she had better hope for the fate I have just described,because if the Order does not come through Galea, I will. I have promised nomercy to the Order. Galea’s treason condemns her to the same fate as the Order.If the Order does not get Cyrilla, then I swear I will, and when I get her, I amgoing to take her back to Aydindril and I’m going to personally throw her backdown into that pit from which you rescued her, and I am going to leave her downthere with every criminal brute I can find for as long as she lives.”Harold’s jaw dropped. “Mother Confessor . . . you wouldn’t.”Kahlan’s eyes told him otherwise. “You be sure to tell Cyrilla what’s in storefor her. Jebra probably tried to tell her, and was thrown in a dungeon for it.Cyrilla is refusing to see the open pit before her, and you are walking into itwith her. Worse, you are taking your innocent people with you.”Kahlan drew her royal Galean sword. She grasped either end in a hand. Grittingher teeth, she pulled the flat of the blade against her knee. The steel bent,then finally snapped with a loud report. She tossed the broken blade on thefloor at his feet.“Now get out of my sight.”He turned to leave, but before he took a step, Zedd stood, holding out a hand asif to ask him to remain where he was.“Mother Confessor,” Zedd said, choosing his words carefully. “I believe you areletting your emotions get in the way.”Harold gestured to Kahlan, relieved to hear Zedd’s intercession. “Tell her,Wizard Zorander. Tell her.”Kahlan couldn’t believe her ears. She remained where she was, staring intoZedd’s hazel eyes. “Then would you mind explaining my error of emotion, FirstWizard?”Zedd glanced at Harold and then back to Kahlan. “Mother Confessor, Queen Cyrillais obviously deranged. Prince Harold is not only doing her a disservice, butenabling her to bring only the specter of death to her people. If he chose theside of reason, he would be protecting his people, and honoring his sister’spast admirable service when she was of sound mind.“Instead, he has betrayed his duty to his people by embracing what he wishes tobe true about her instead of facing what is true. In this way, he is embracingdeath, and in this case, embracing death for his people, too.“Prince Harold has been justly found guilty of treason. Your emotions for himare interfering with your judgment. Obviously, he is now a danger to our cause,to the lives of our people, and to the lives of his own people. He cannot beallowed to leave.”Harold looked thunderstruck. “But Zedd. . .”Zedd’s hazel eyes, too, were a terrible pronouncement of guilt. He waited, as ifchallenging the man to further prove his treason. Harold’s mouth moved, but hecould offer no words.“Does anyone disagree with me?” Zedd asked.He looked at Adie. She shook her head. Verna likewise shook her head. Warrenstared at Harold for a moment, then shook his head.Harold’s expression turned indignant. “I’m not going to stand for this. TheMother Confessor has given me until dawn to withdraw. You must honor hersentence.”He took two strides toward the door, but then paused, clutching his chest.Twisting slowly as he started to sink, his eyes rolling up in his head. His legsfolded and he crashed to the floor.Kahlan sat stunned. No one moved or said anything. General Meiffert went down onone knee beside the body, checking Prince Harold for breath or pulse. Thegeneral looked up at Kahlan and shook his head.She passed her gaze from Zedd, to Adie, to Verna, to Warren. None revealedanything in their expression.Kahlan stood and spoke softly. “I don’t ever want to know which one of you didthis. I’m not saying you were wrong . . . I just don’t want to know.”The four gifted people nodded.At the door, Kahlan stood in the bright sunlight a moment, feeling the cold airon her face, searching, until she saw Captain Ryan leaning against a stout youngmaple tree. He stood at attention as she strode out to him through the snow.“Bradley, did Prince Harold tell you why he was coming here?”Calling him by his given name, rather than his rank, changed the nature of thequestion. His rigid posture slackened.“Yes, Mother Confessor. He said he had to tell you that he had been ordered backby his queen to defend Galea, and that he was further ordered to bring his menserving with you back to Galea with him.”“Then what are you doing here? Why did you and your men come along, if he was totake everyone back?”He lifted his square jaw and looked at her with clear blue eyes. “Because wedeserted, Mother Confessor.”“You what?”“Prince Harold gave me his orders, as I just reported them. I told him that itwas wrong, and could only harm our people. He said it was not for me to decidesuch things. He said it was not for me to think, but to follow orders.“I’ve fought with you, Mother Confessor. I believe I know you better than PrinceHarold does-I know you are devoted to protecting the lives of the people of theMidlands. I told him that what Cyrilla was doing was wrong. He was angry, andsaid it was my duty to follow my orders.“I told him that, in that case, I was deserting the Galean army and was going tostand with you, instead. I thought he was going to have me put to death fordisobeying him, but he would have had to put all thousand of us to death becauseall the men felt the same way. A good many came forward to tell him so. The fireseemed to go out of him, then, and he let us ride down here with him.“I hope you aren’t angry with us, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan couldn’t force herself to be the Mother Confessor at that moment. She puther arms around him.“Thank you, Bradley.”She gripped his shoulders and smiled at him through her watery vision. “You usedyour head. I couldn’t be angry with that.”“You told us once we were a badger trying to swallow an ox whole. Looks to meyou’ve taken to trying to do the same thing. If there ever was a badger whocould swallow an ox whole, it would be you, Mother Confessor, but I guess wewouldn’t want you to try it without us to help you do it.”They turned then and saw General Meiffert directing some of his men. They werecarrying Prince Harold’s limp body out of the lodge, holding him by theshoulders and feet. His hands dragged through the snow.“I figured this wasn’t going to come to any good end,” the young captain said.“Ever since Cyrilla was hurt, Prince Harold just never seemed himself. I alwaysloved the man. It hurt me to have to desert him. But he just wasn’t making senseanymore.”Kahlan put a comforting hand on his shoulder as they watched the body beingcarried away.“I’m sorry, Bradley. Like you, I always thought highly of him. I guess seeinghis sister and his queen so long held in the grip of that kind of sickness justbrought him to his wits’ end. Try to keep your good memories of him.”“I will, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan changed the subject. “I’ll need one of your men to take a message toCyrilla. I was going to have Harold take it, but now we’ll need a messenger.”“I will see to it, Mother Confessor.”She only then realized how cold it was outside, and that she didn’t have acloak. As the captain went to get his men quartered and to pick out a man to actas a messenger, Kahlan went back inside the lodge.Cara was putting more wood on the hearth. Verna and Adie had gone. Warren wasselecting a rolled map from the basket of maps and diagrams in the corner.As he was leaving; Kahlan caught Warren’s arm. She looked into the wizard’s blueeyes, knowing they were much older than they appeared. Richard had always saidthat Warren was one of the smartest people he had ever met. Besides that,Warren’s true talent was said to lie in the area of prophecy.“Warren, are we all going to die in this mad war?”His face softened with a shy but impish grin. “I thought you didn’t believe inprophecy, Kahlan.”She released his arm. “I guess I don’t. Never mind.”Cara, leaving to find some more firewood, followed Warren out. Kahlan warmedherself before the hearth as she stared at Spirit standing on the mantel. Zeddrested a comforting hand on her shoulder.“What you had to say to Harold about using your mind, about reason, was verywise, Kahlan. You were right.”Her fingers touched the buttery smooth walnut robes of Spirit. “It was whatRichard said, when he was telling me what he had finally come to understandabout what he had to do. He said the only sovereign he could allow to rule himwas reason.”“Richard said that? Those were his very words?”Kahlan nodded as she gazed at Spirit. “He said the first law of reason is thatwhat exists, exists; what is, is, and that from this irreducible, bedrockprinciple, all knowledge is built. He said that was the foundation from whichlife is embraced.“He said thinking is a choice, and that wishes and whims are not facts, nor arethey a means to discover them. I guess Harold proved the point. Richard saidreason is our only way of grasping reality-that it’s our basic tool of survival.We are free to evade the effort of thinking-to reject reason-but we are not freeto avoid the penalty of the abyss we refuse to see.”She listened to the fire crackling at her feet as she let her gaze wander overthe lines of the figure he had carved for her. When she heard nothing from Zedd,she looked over her shoulder. He was staring into the flames, a tear runningdown his cheek.“Zedd, what’s wrong?”“The boy figured it out himself.” The old wizard’s voice was the uneasy sum ofloneliness and quiet pride. “He understands it-he interpreted it perfectly. Heeven came to it on his own, by applying it.”“Came to what?”“The most important rule there is, the Wizard’s Sixth Rule: the only sovereignyou can allow to rule you is reason.”Reflections of the firelight danced in his hazel eyes. “The Sixth Rule is thehub upon which all rules turn. It is not only the most important rule, but thesimplest. Nonetheless, it is the one most often ignored and violated, and by farthe most despised. It must be wielded in spite of the ceaseless, howlingprotests of the wicked.“Misery, iniquity, and utter destruction lurk in the shadows outside its fulllight, where half-truths snare the faithful disciples, the deeply feelingbelievers, the selfless followers.“Faith and feelings are the warm marrow of evil. Unlike reason, faith andfeelings provide no boundary to limit any delusion, any whim. They are avirulent poison, giving the numbing illusion of moral sanction to everydepravity ever hatched.“Faith and feelings are the darkness to reason’s light.“Reason is the very substance of truth itself. The glory that is life is whollyembraced through reason, through this rule. In rejecting it, in rejectingreason, one embraces death.”By the next morning, about half of the Galean force had vanished, returning totheir homeland and queen as ordered by Prince Harold before his death. The rest,like Captain Ryan and his young soldiers, remained loyal to the D’Haran Empire.Lieutenant Leiden, the former general, and his entire force of Keltish troopshad also departed by morning. He left Kahlan a letter, in it saying that withGalea choosing to break with the D’Haran Empire, he had to return to helpprotect Kelton, as surely the selfish actions of the Galeans meant the Orderwould be more likely to come up the Kern River Valley and threaten Kelton. Hewrote that he hoped the Mother Confessor would realize how grave was the dangerto Kelton, and understand that it was not his intention to desert her or theD’Haran Empire, but simply to help protect his people.Kahlan knew of the men leaving; General Meiffert and Warren had come to tellher. She had expected it, and had been watching. She told General Meiffert toallow them to leave if they wished. War in their camp could come to no good end.The morale of the remaining men was boosted by a sense of being on the rightside, and of doing the right thing.That afternoon, as she was drafting an urgent letter to General Baldwin,commander of all Keltish forces, General Meiffert and Captain Ryan came to seeher. After listening to their plan, she granted Captain Ryan permission to gowith a like number of General Meiffert’s handpicked D’Haran special forces toconduct raids on the Imperial Order force. Warren and six Sisters were sent toaccompany them.With the Imperial Order having moved so far back to the south, Kahlan neededinformation on what they were doing and what shape their force was in. More thanthat, though, with the foul weather in their favor, she wanted to keep pressureon the enemy. Captain Bradley Ryan and his band of nearly a thousand wereexperienced mountain fighters and had grown up in just such harsh conditions.Kahlan had fought beside the captain and his young Galean soldiers, and hadhelped train them in the ways of fighting a vastly superior force. If only theenemy force did not number over a million . . .General Meiffert’s special forces, which, until Kahlan had promoted him, he hadably commanded, were now led by Captain Zimmer, a young, square jawed,bullnecked D’Haran with an infectious smile. They were everything Captain Ryan’syoung men were, tripled: experienced, businesslike under stress, tireless,fearless, and coolly efficient at killing. What made most soldiers blanch madethem grin.They preferred fighting just such as this, where they were free of massivebattlefield tactics and could instead use their special skills. They treasuredbeing let off the leash to do what they did best. Rather than check them, Kahlangave them a free hand.Each of those D’Harans collected enemy ears.They felt a great fidelity to Kahlan, in part because she didn’t try to reinthem in and integrate them into the larger army, and, perhaps more so, becausewhen they returned from missions, she always asked to see their strings of ears.They relished being appreciated.Kahlan intended to later send them to collect Galean ears."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 42Kahlan glanced over her shoulder at the Prelate bent over the map basket in thecorner. It had been almost a full phase of the moon since Warren had left on themission with captains Ryan and Zimmer. Although it was difficult to judgeaccurately just how long such missions would last, they should have been back bynow. Kahlan knew all too well the kind of worry that had to be churning beneaththe woman’s no-nonsense exterior.“Verna,” Kahlan asked as she rubbed her arms, “on your way past, could you throwsome more wood on the fire, please?”Cara hopped down off her stool, where she was perched, watching over Kahlan’sshoulder. “I’ll do it.”Verna pulled a map free and, on her way back to the table, thanked Cara. “Hereit is, Zedd. I think this better shows the area you’re talking about.”Zedd unfurled the new map over the top of the one already laid out on the tablebefore Kahlan. It was a larger scale, giving a more detailed look at thesouthern regions of the Midlands.“Yes,” Zedd drawled as he peered at the new map. “See here?” He tapped the DrunRiver. “See how narrow the lowlands are down south, through here? That’s what Iwas talking about. Rough country, with cliffs in places hemming the river.That’s why I don’t think they would try to go up the Drun Valley.”“I suppose you’re right,” Verna said.“Besides”-Kahlan waggled a finger over the area to the north on the first map”upthis way is mostly only Nicobarese. They are rather isolated, and so a temptingtarget, but they aren’t a wealthy land. The plunder and trade goods would beslim. The Order has much more opportunity for conquest if they stay over here.Besides, can you see how difficult it would be for them to get their army backover the Rang’Shada mountains, if they went up the Drun? Strategically, itwouldn’t make as much sense for them to go up that way.”Verna idly twiddled with a button on her blue dress as she studied the map. “Yes. . . I see what you mean.”“But your point is well taken,” Kahlan said. “It wouldn’t be a bad idea if yousent a Sister or two to watch that area; just because it doesn’t make as muchlogistic sense, that doesn’t mean Jagang wouldn’t try it. Come spring, he’sbound to move on us. We wouldn’t want to be surprised to find the Imperial Orderstorming in the back door to Aydindril.”Cara answered the knock at the door. It was a head scout named Hayes. Kahlanstood when she saw through the open door and nearby trees that Captain Ryan wasalso making his way toward the lodge.Hayes saluted with a fist to his heart.“Glad to see you back, Corporal Hayes,” Kahlan said.“Thank you, Mother Confessor. It’s good to be back.”He looked like he could use a meal. After Captain Ryan rushed in through thedoor, Cara pushed it shut against the blowing snow. Hayes stepped to the side,out of the way of the captain.Kahlan was relieved to see the young Galean officer. “How did everything go,Captain? How is everyone?”He pulled off his scarf and wool hat as he caught his breath; Verna looked to beholding hers.“Good,” the captain said. “We did well. The Sisters were able to heal some ofour wounded. Some needed to be transported for a ways before the Sisters couldsee to them. That slowed us. We had a few losses, but not as many as we feared.Warren was a great help.”“Where is Warren?” Zedd asked.As if bidden by his name, Warren came in through the door, escorted by aswirling gust of snow. Kahlan squinted at the slash of bright light until thedoor was pushed shut once more. She caught the look on Verna’s face, andrecalled how lighthearted she always felt to see Richard back safely when theyhad been separated. Warren casually kissed Verna on the cheek with a quick peck.Kahlan noticed the look they shared, even if no one else did. She was happy forthem, but still, the reminder was like a jab at the pain of her helplessheartache and worry over Richard.“Did you tell them?” Warren asked, unbuttoning his cloak.“No,” Captain Ryan said. “We haven’t had a chance yet.”Zedd’s brow drew down. “Tell us what?”Warren heaved a sigh. “Well, Verna’s special glass worked better than we thoughtit had. We captured several men and questioned them at length. The ones we sawdead in the valley were only the ones who died at first.”Verna helped Warren shed his heavy, snow-crusted cloak. She put it on the floorby the fire, where Captain Ryan had laid his brown coat to dry.“It seems,” Warren went on, “that there were a great many-maybe another sixty,seventy thousand-who didn’t go blind, but who lost the sight in one eye, or haveimpaired vision. The Order couldn’t very well abandon them, because they canstill see well enough to stay with the rest, but more important, it’s hoped thatmaybe those men will heal, and regain full use of their sight-and their abilityto fight.”“Not likely,” Verna said.“I don’t think so, either,” Warren said, “but that’s what they are thinking,anyway. Another goodly number, maybe twenty five or thirty thousand, aresick---their eyes and noses red and horribly infected.”Verna nodded. “The glass will do that.”“Then some more, maybe half that number, are having breathing difficulty.”“So,” Kahlan said, “with those killed and those injured enough to keep them frombeing effective fighters, that makes somewhere near one hundred fifty thousandput out of the way by the glass dust. Quite an accomplishment, Verna.”Verna looked as pleased as Kahlan. “It was worth that horse ride scaring thewits out of me. It wouldn’t have worked had you not thought of doing it thatway.”“What kind of success did you have, Captain?” Cara asked as she came to standbehind Kahlan.,“Captain Zimmer and I had the kind of success we hoped for. I’d guess we tookout maybe ten thousand in the time we were down there.”Zedd let out a slow whistle. “Pretty heavy fighting.”“Not really. Not the way the Mother Confessor taught us to do it, and not theway Captain Zimmer works, either. Mostly we eliminate the enemy as efficientlyas possible, and try to keep from having to fight at all. If you slit a man’sthroat in his sleep, you can accomplish a lot more, and you’re less likely toget hurt yourself.”Kahlan smiled. “I’m glad you were such a good student.”Captain Ryan lifted a thumb. “Warren and the Sisters were a great help atgetting us where we needed to be without being discovered. Any word about thewhite cloaks, yet? We could really use them. I can tell you for a fact that theywould have enabled us to do more.”“We just got in our first load the day before yesterday,” Kahlan told him. “Morethan enough for your men and Captain Zimmer’s. We’ll have more within a fewdays.”Captain Ryan rubbed his hands, warming his fingers. “Captain Zimmer will bepleased.”Zedd gestured to the south. “Did you find out why they withdrew so far back overground they’d taken?”Warren nodded. “From the men we questioned, we found out that they have fevergoing through their camp. Nothing we did, just your regular fever that happensin such crowded camp conditions in the field. But they’ve lost tens of thousandsof men to the fever. They wanted to withdraw to put some distance between us,give themselves some breathing room. They aren’t concerned about being able topush us out of their way when they wish.”That made sense. With their numbers, it was only natural for them to beconfident, even cavalier, about dealing with any opposition. Kahlan couldn’tunderstand why Warren and Captain Ryan looked so downhearted. She sensed that,despite their good news, there was something amiss.“Dear spirits,” Kahlan said, trying to give them some cheer. “Their numbers aredwindling away like snow beside the hearth. This is better than-”Warren held up a hand. “I asked Hayes, here, to come and give you his reportfirsthand. I think you had better hear him out.”Kahlan motioned the man to come forward. He stepped smartly up to her table andsnapped to attention.“Let’s hear what you have to report, Corporal Hayes.”His face looked chalky, and despite the cold, he was sweating.“Mother Confessor, my scout team was down to the southeast, watching the routesin from the wilds, and watching, too in case the Order tried to swing widearound us. Well, I guess the short of it is, we spotted a column making its waywest to resupply and reinforce the Order.”“They’re a big army,” Kahlan said. “They would have supplies sent from theirhomeland to augment what they can get as spoils. A supply column would have menguarding them.”“I followed them for a week, just to get an accurate count.”“How many,” Kahlan asked.“Well over a quarter million, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan’s flesh tingled as if icy needles were dancing over it.“How many?” Verna asked.“At least two hundred and fifty thousand men at arms, plus drivers and civilianswith the supplies.”Everything they had worked for, all the sacrifices, all the struggle to whittledown the Imperial Order, had just been nullified. Worse than nullified, theirwork had been erased, and nearly that many more had been added to the force theenemy had started with.“Dear spirits,” Kahlan whispered, “how many men does the Old World have to throwat us?”When she met Warren’s gaze, she knew that this number, even, was hardlysurprising to him.Warren gestured to the scout. “Hayes saw only the first group. The men wecaptured told us about the reinforcements. We weren’t sure they were telling usthe truth-we thought they might be trying to spook us-but then we met up withCorporal Hayes, on his way back. We did some further questioning andscoutingthat’s why we were delayed in returning.”“Another quarter million . . .” Kahlan’s words trailed off. It all seemed sohopeless.Warren cleared his throat. “That is just the first column of fresh troops. Moreare coming.”Kahlan went to the hearth and warmed her hands as she stared into the flames.She was standing beneath the statue Richard had carved for her, to make her feelbetter. Kahlan wished that at that moment she could recall the defiant feelingSpirit portrayed. It felt as if she could only contemplate death.The news of the Imperial Order reinforcements, just as the news of departure ofthe Galeans and Keltans, spread through the camp faster than a storm wind.Kahlan, Zedd, Warren, Verna, Adie, General Meiffert, and all the rest of theofficers held nothing back from the men. Those men were risking their livesdaily and had a right to the truth. If Kahlan was passing through the camp, anda soldier was brave enough to ask her, she told him what she knew. She tried togive them confidence, too, but she didn’t lie to them.The men, having struggled for so long, were beyond fear. The bleak mood was apalpable pall smothering the spark of life out of them. They went about theirtasks as if numb, accepting their fate, which now seemed sealed, resigned to theinevitable. The New World offered no shelter, no safe place, nowhere to hidefrom the boundless menace of the Imperial Order.Kahlan showed the soldiers a determined face. She had no choice. Captain Ryanand his men, having been through such despair before, were less troubled by thenews. They couldn’t die; they were already dead. Along with Kahlan, the youngGaleans had long ago taken an oath of the dead, and could only be returned tolife when the Order was destroyed.None of it mattered much to Captain Zimmer and his men. They knew what needed tobe done, and they simply kept at it. Each of them now had multiple strings ofears. They began new strings at one hundred. It was a matter of honor to themthat they kept only the right ear, so no two ears could be from the same man.Representative Theriault of Herjborgue was as good as his word. The white woolcloaks, hats, and mittens arrived weekly, helping hide the men who regularlywent on missions, while the weather was in their favor, to attack the ImperialOrder. With the sickness in the Order’s camp leaving so many of them weak, alongwith so many of the enemy having impaired vision, those missions wereextraordinarily successful. Troops wearing the concealing cloaks were also sentto lie in wait and intercept any supply trains, hoping to neutralize thereinforcements before they could join with the enemy’s main force.Still, the attacks were little more than an annoyance to the Order.Kahlan, after a meeting with a group just returned, found Zedd alone in thelodge, looking over the latest information that had been added to the maps.“Good fortune,” she said when he looked up, watching as she removed her furmantle. “The men who just got in had few casualties, and they caught a largegroup out on patrol. They were able to cut them off and take them all out,including one of Jagang’s Sisters.”“Then why the long face?”She could only lift her hands in a forsaken gesture of futility.“Try not to be so disheartened,” Zedd told her. “Despair is often war’shandmaiden. I can’t tell you how many years it was, back when I was young, thateveryone fighting for their lives in that war back then thought that it was onlya matter of time until we were crushed. We went on to win.”“I know, Zedd. I know.” Kahlan rubbed at the chill in her hands. She almosthated to say it, but she finally did. “Richard wouldn’t come to lead the armybecause he said that the way things stand now, we can’t win. He said whether ornot we fight the Order, the world will fall under its shadow, and if we fight,it will only result in more death-that our side will be destroyed, the Orderwould still rule the world, and any chance for winning in the future would belost.”Zedd peered at her with one eye. “Then what are you doing here?”“Richard said we can’t win, but, dear spirits, I can’t let myself believe that.I would rather die fighting to be free, to help keep my people free, than tolive the death of a slave. Yet, I know I’m violating Richard’s wishes, hisadvice, and his orders. I gave him my word .... I feel as if I’m treading thequicksand of betrayal, and taking everyone with me.”She searched his face for some sign that Richard might have been wrong. “Yousaid that he had figured out the Wizard’s Sixth Rule on his own-that we must useour minds to see the reality of the way things are. I had hopes. I thought hehad to be wrong about the futility of this war, but now. . .”Zedd smiled to himself, as if finding fancy in something she saw as onlyhorrifying.“This is going to be a long war. It is far from beyond hope, much less decided.This is the agony of leadership in such a struggle-the doubts, the fears, thefeelings of hopelessness. Those are feelings-not necessarily reality. Not yet.We have much yet to bring to bear.“Richard said what he believed based on the way matters stood at the time hesaid them. Who is to say that the people are not now prepared to provethemselves to him? Prove themselves ready to reject the Order? Perhaps whatRichard needed in order for him to commit to the battle, has already comeabout.”“But I know how strongly he warned me against joining this battle. He meant whathe said. Still . . . I don’t have Richard’s strength, the strength to turn myback and let it happen.” Kahlan gestured to her inkstand on the table. “I’vesent letters asking that more troops be sent down here.”He smiled again, as if to say that proved it could be done.“It will take continual effort to grind down the enemy’s numbers. I think wehave yet to deal the Order a truly serious blow, but we will. The Sisters and Iwill come up with something. You never know in matters of this kind. It could bethat we will suddenly do something that will send them reeling.”Kahlan smiled and rubbed his shoulder. “Thanks, Zedd. I’m so thankful to haveyou with us.” Her gaze wandered to Spirit, standing proudly above the hearth.She stepped over to the mantel, as if to an altar that held the sacred carving.“Dear spirits, I miss him.”It was a question without the words, hoping he would surprise her with somethingthat he had thought of to help get Richard back.“I know, dear one. I miss him, too. He’s alive-that’s the most important thing.”Kahlan could only nod.Zedd clapped his hands together, as if taken with a gleeful thought. “What weneed, more than anything, is something to get everyone’s mind off of the task athand for a while. Something to give them a reason to cheer together for a while.It would do them more good than anything.”Kahlan frowned over her shoulder. “Like what? You mean some kind of game, orsomething?”His face was all screwed up in musing. “I don’t know. Something happy. Somethingto show them that the Order can’t stop us from living our lives. Can’t stop usfrom the enjoyment of life-of what life is really all about.” He stroked a thumbalong the sharp line of his jaw. “Any ideas?”“Well, I can’t really think of-”Just then, Warren strode in. “Just got a report from over in the Drun Valley.Our lucky day-no activity, as we expected.”He stopped dead in his tracks, his hand still holding the door lever, lookingfrom Kahlan to Zedd and back again.“What’s the matter? What’s going on? Why are you two looking at me like that?”Verna came up behind Warren and gave him a shove into the lodge. “Go on, go on,get in there. Close the door. What’s the matter with you? It’s freezing outthere.”Verna huffed and shut the door herself. When she turned around and saw Zedd andKahlan, she backed a step.“Vema, Warren,” Zedd said in a honeyed voice, “come on in, won’t you?”Verna scowled. “What are you two scheming and grinning at?”“Well,” Zedd drawled as he winked at Kahlan, “the Mother Confessor and I werejust discussing the big event.”Verna’s scowl darkened as she leaned in. “What big event? I’ve heard nothingabout any big event.”Even Warren, rarely given to scowling, was scowling now. “That’s right. What bigevent?”“Your wedding,” Zedd said.Both Verna and Warren’s scowls evaporated as they straightened. They wereovercome with surprised, silly, radiant grins.“Really?” Warren asked.“Really?” Verna asked.“Yes, really,” Kahlan said."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 43It took more than two weeks to prepare for Verna and Warren’s wedding. It wasn’tthat it couldn’t have been done more quickly, but rather, as Zedd had explainedto Kahlan, he wanted-to “drag out the whole affair.” He wanted to give everyoneample time to ponder it and to dream up lavish doings; time to organize, to makedecorations, to cook special foods, to get the camp ready for a grand party;time to have a stretch where everyone could gossip about it as they eagerlylooked forward to the big event.The soldiers, at first merely pleased, soon got caught up in the spirit of theoccasion. It became a grand diversion.They all liked Warren. He was the sort of man that everyone felt a little sorryfor, a bit protective of-the awkward shy type. Most didn’t have the foggiestunderstanding of many of the things he babbled about. They thought that he justwasn’t the type who would ever win a woman. That he had, to them seeminglyagainst all odds, gave the men an inner pride that he was one of theirs, and hehad done it: he’d won a woman’s heart. It gave them hope that they might one dayhave a wedding, a wife, and a family, even if they were afraid that they, too,were often awkward and shy.The men even openly expressed happiness for Verna. She was a woman theyrespected, but had never exactly felt warmly toward. Their bold well-wishesflummoxed her.The entire camp was caught up in the spirit of the event even more than Kahlanhad hoped. After a brief pause in the beginning, while it sank in, the men, soweary not only of fighting against such odds, the loss of friends, and being inthe field away from their homes and loved ones for so long, but also the harsh,difficult, dreary weather, took to the diversion with gusto.A large central area was cleared-tents moved, and the area cleaned of snow downto the bare ground. At the head of the cleared area, they built a platform-laidacross anchored supply wagonsatop which the wedding was to take place. Theplatform was needed so that the men would have a better chance to see theceremony. A dance area was set aside and those men with musical instruments, andnot out on duty, spent night and day practicing. A choir was formed and went offto a secluded ravine to rehearse. Wherever Kahlan went, she could hear pipes anddrums, or the piercing notes of a shawm, or the melodic chords of strings. Mencame to fear playing off-key more than they feared the Imperial Order.With over a hundred Sisters available, it was suggested that there could bedancing after the ceremony. The Sisters liked the idea, until they started doingthe math and realized how many men there were to each woman, and how muchdancing they would be doing. Still, they were titillated at the prospect ofhaving attention lavished on them at a dance, and approved the idea. Womencenturies old were blushing like girls again at all the requests from men intheir teens and twenties for the promise of a turn with them at the weddingdance.As the wedding approached the men made streets, of sorts, in a winding coursethrough the camp, so that after the ceremony, the wedding party could pass inreview through the entire camp. All the men wanted a chance to be a part ingreeting the newly married couple and wishing them well.Kahlan had the idea that, after the wedding, Warren and Verna should have thelodge. It was to be her wedding gift to them, so, for the most part, she kept ita secret. Kahlan had Cara direct the public pretense of having a tent set asideand reserved for the newly married couple. Cara moved Verna’s things in thetent, and freshened it up with herbs and frozen sprigs with wild berries. Thediversion worked; Verna believed the tent was to be hers and Warren’s, andwouldn’t let him into it until after they were married.The day of the wedding dawned with sparkling blue skies, and wasn’t so cold thatpeople were likely to get frostbite. The fresh snow of the day before wasquickly cleared out of the central area so that the festivities could take placewithout the Sisters getting snow down their boots as they danced. Some of theSisters came out to inspect the dance floor, sauntering around, giving the men alook at who they might get to have a turn with-if they were lucky. It was alldone with much humor and good cheer.While Verna spent the early afternoon in her tent, submitting to having her hairfussed over, her face painted, and her wedding dress tended to by a gaggle ofSisters, Kahlan was finally able to have the secrecy she needed in order todecorate the lodge. Inside, she secured fragrant, feathery, balsam boughs to acord and draped it in swags around the top of every wall. She tied redberries-as that was all she could come by-into the boughs to give them somecolor.One of the Sisters had given Kahlan some plain weave fabric that Kahlan had madeinto a curtain for the window. She had worked on it when she retired to thelodge at night, stitching designs to give the simple material a lacy look. Shekept it under her bed so that when they came in to go over battlefield strategy,Verna and Warren wouldn’t know what she was doing. Kahlan was finally able toput the scented candles, donated by different Sisters as gifts, all around theroom, and at last hang the curtain on a straight limb she stripped of bark.The one thing Kahlan wouldn’t leave to brighten the lodge for the newly weddedcouple was Spirit. That, she would take to her new tent.As Kahlan was making up the bed with fresh bedding, Cara came in with an armloadof something blue.Kahlan folded the blanket under the foot of the straw-filled mattress as shewatched Cara shut the door.“What have you got there?”“You won’t believe it,” Cara said with a grin. “Wide blue silk ribbon. TheSisters have Verna tied to a chair while they’re fussing over her, and Zedd hasWarren off doing something, so I thought you and I could use the ribbon todecorate the place a little. Drape it around. Make it look pretty.” She pointed.“Like up there-we could wind it around the balsam you hung to give it a fancylook.”Kahlan blinked in surprise. “What a good idea.”She didn’t know what was more astonishing, actually seeing Cara with blue silkribbon, or hearing her say “decorate” and “pretty” in the same breath. Shesmiled to herself, happy to have heard such a thing. Zedd was more of a wizardthan he knew.Kahlan and Cara each stood on a log round, working their way along the wall asthey wove the ribbon through and around the swagged balsam boughs. It was sobeautiful seeing the first wall completed that Kahlan couldn’t stop gazing andgrinning. They started in on the second wall, opposite the door, using extraribbon for best effect when Verna and Warren first entered and saw their newplace.“Where did you ever get all this ribbon, away?” Kahlan asked around a mouthfulof pins.“Benjamin got it for me.” Cara chuckled as she threaded the ribbon around thecord. “Can you believe it? He made me promise not to ask him where he got itfrom.”Kahlan took the pins from her mouth. “Who?”“Who what?” Cara mumbled before she stuck her tongue out the corner of her mouthwhile wiggling a pin into a tight place.“Who did you say got you the ribbon?”Cara lifted another length of blue silk to the ceiling. “General Meiffert. Idon’t have a clue where he-”“You said Benjamin.”Cara lowered the ribbon and stared at Kahlan. “No I didn’t.”“Yes, you did. You said Benjamin.”“I said General Meiffert. You only thought-”“I never knew that General Meiffert’s first name was Benjamin.”“Well...”“Is `Benjamin’ General Meiffert’s first name?”Had Cara been wearing her red leather, her face would have matched it. As itwas, her dark scowl matched the brown leather she had on.“You know it is.”A smile grew on Kahlan’s lips. “I do now.”Kahlan wore her white Mother Confessor’s dress. She was a bit surprised tonotice that it fit a little loosely, but all things considered, she supposed itwas to be expected. Because of the cold, she also wore the wolf fur mantleRichard had made for her, but draped it around her shoulders more like a stole.She stood with her back straight and chin held high, overseeing the ceremony andgazing out at the tens of thousands of quiet faces. Behind her was a richverdant wall of woven boughs that enabled distant spectators to more easily pickout the six people up on the platform. An ethereal mist of silent breath liftedin the still, golden, lateafternoon air.As he conducted the wedding ceremony, Zedd’s back was to her. Kahlan wasfascinated to see his wavy white hair, perpetually in disarray, now brushed andsmoothed down. He wore his fine maroon robes with black sleeves and cowledshoulders. Silver brocade circled the cuffs, while gold brocade ran around theneck and down the front. A red satin belt set with a gold buckle gathered theoutfit at his waist. Adie stood beside him, wearing her simple sorceress’s robeswith their yellow and red beads at the neckline. Somehow, the contrast looked asgrand.Verna wore a rich violet dress done up with gold stitching at the squareneckline.The intricate gold needlework ran down the tight sleeves showing under slashedsham sleeves tied at the elbow with gold ribbon. The delicate smocking over themidriff extending in a funnel shape down into a gored skirt flaring nearly tothe floor. Vema’s wavy brown hair was festooned with blue, gold, and crimsonflowers the sisters had made from little pieces of silk. With her serene smile,she made a beautiful sorceress bride standing beside the handsome blond groom inhis violet wizard’s robes.Everyone seemed to lean in a little as the ceremony reached the climax.“Do you, Vema, take this wizard to be your husband for life,” Zedd went on in aclear tone that carried out over the crowd, “mindful of his gift and duty to it,and swear to both love and honor him without pause for as long as you live?”“I do,” Vema said in a silken voice.“Do you, Warren,” Adie said, her voice all the more raspy in contrast to Vema’s,“take this sorceress to be your wife for life, mindful of her gift and duty toit, and swear to both love and honor her without pause for as long as you live?“I do,” Warren said in a confident tone.“Then, it being of your free will, I accept you, sorceress, as being agreeableand give my joyful blessing to this union.” Zedd raised outstretched arms upinto the air. “I ask the good spirits to smile on this woman’s oath.”“Then, it being of your free will, I accept you, wizard, as being agreeable andgive my joyful blessing to this union.” Adie raised outstretched arms up intothe air. “I ask the good spirits to smile on this man’s oath.”The four of them crossed their arms and joined hands. With heads bowed, the airin the center of their circle glowed with a living light shining on the union.The brilliant flare sent a golden ray skyward, as if carrying the oath to thegood spirits.Together, Zedd and Adie said, “From this time forward, you are forever joined ashusband and wife, both by oath, by love, and now by gift.”The magical light dissolved from the bottom up until it was but a solitary stardirectly above them in an empty, late-afternoon sky.In the silent winter air tens of thousands of spellbound eyes watched atrembling Vema meet Warren’s kiss to seal a wedding unlike any they were likelyto ever see again: the marriage of a sorceress and a wizard, bound by more thanany mere oath-bound also by a covenant of magic.When Vema and Warren parted, both wearing broad smiles, the crowd went wild.Cheers, along with hats, rose into the air.Both beaming, Vema and Warren joined hands after they tumed to the soldiers.They waved with their free arms high in the air. Soldiers cheered, applauded,and whistled as if it were their own sister or best friend who was just married.The voices of the choir then built in an extended note that reverberated throughthe trees all around. It made Kahlan’s skin tingle with the quality of itshaunting tone. The sound brought a reverent hush to the valley.Cara leaned close to Kahlan and whispered in astonishment that the choir wassinging an ancient D’Haran wedding ceremonial song, the origin of which wentback thousands of years. Since the men had gone off to practice alone, Kahlanhadn’t heard it before the wedding. It was so powerful it swept her emotionsaway with the rise and fall of the joined voices. Vema and Warren stood on theedge of the platform, likewise gripped by the achingly beautiful song to theirunion.Flutes joined in, and then drums. The soldiers, mostly D’Haran, smiled as theylistened to the music they knew well. It struck Kahlan then, since she had solong thought of D’Hara as an enemy land, that she had never really thought ofD’Harans as having traditions that could be meaningful, or stirring, or beloved.Kahlan glanced over at Cara, standing beside her, smiling distantly as shelistened to the music. There was an entire land of D’Hara that was largely amystery to Kahlan; she had only seen their soldiers. She knew nothing of theirwomen other than the Mord-Sith, and they were hardly typical-or their children,or their homes, or their customs. She had come to think of them as joinedtogether at last, but she now realized that they were a people she didn’t know,a people with their own heritage.“It’s beautiful,” Kahlan whispered to Cara.Cara nodded blissfully, carried away on the strains of music that was an oldacquaintance to her and a exotic wonder to Kahlan.As the choir came to the end of their tribute to the newly wedded couple, Vernareached back and squeezed Kahlan’s hand. It was an apology of sorts-anacknowledgment of how difficult this ceremony must be for Kahlan.Refusing to let that hurt tarnish this joyous event, Kahlan beamed at Verna’squick glance. She came forward, standing behind Warren and Verna with an armaround each. The noise of the crowd trailed off so Kahlan could speak.“These two people belong together. Perhaps they always have. Now they forevershall be. May the good spirits be with them always.”With one voice, the entire crowd repeated the prayer.“I want to thank Verna and Warren from the bottom of my heart,” Kahlan said asshe gazed out at the tens of thousands of faces watching, “for reminding us whatlife is really about. There is no more eloquent demonstration of the simple yetdeep meaning of our cause than this wedding today.”Heads as far as she could see bobbed in agreement.“Now,” Kahlan called out, “who wants to see these two have the first dance?”The men cheered and hooted as they spread back to open up the central area.Musicians lined up along the benches at the sides.As they waited for Verna and Warren to make their way down to the dance area,Kahlan draped an arm over Zedd’s shoulder and kissed his cheek.“This is the best idea you ever had, wizard.”He took her in with hazel eyes that seemed to see all the way to a person’ssoul.“Are you all right, dear one? I know this has to be hard.”Kahlan nodded, holding her grin firmly in place. “I’m fine. It has to be hard onyou, twice over.”A smile took him unexpectedly. “There you go again, Mother Confessor. Worryingabout others.”Kahlan watched a laughing Verna and Warren, arm in arm, dancing lightly acrossthe open area ringed by applauding soldiers.“When they’re done,” Kahlan asked, “and after you’ve given your first to Adie,would you dance with me, sir? Stand in for him? I’m sure he would want that.”Kahlan couldn’t bring herself to say his name at that moment, or the spell ofthe joyful celebration would have been broken.Zedd lifted an eyebrow with playful delight. “What makes you think I can dance?”Kahlan laughed. “Because there isn’t anything you can’t do.”“I be able to name a number of things this skinny old man can’t do,” Adie saidwith a smile as she shuffled up behind him.When the dance was done, and others began joining in as the newly married couplebegan the second, Zedd and Adie went out in the ring to have a dance and showthe young people how it was done. Kahlan stood at the edge of the circle withCara close at her side. General Meiffert, laughing and shaking men’s hands,slapping others on the back, made his way over.“Mother Confessor!” He was pushed up close by the press of the crowd. “MotherConfessor, this is a wonderful day, isn’t it? Have you ever seen the likes ofit?”Kahlan couldn’t help but to smile at his delight. “No, General Meiffert, I don’tthink I have.”He glanced briefly at Cara. He stood awkwardly a moment, then turned to watchthe dancing. Despite how well the men had come to know her, Kahlan was still aConfessor-a woman people feared to be near, much less touch. No one was likelyto ask a Confessor to dance.Or a Mord-Sith.“General?” Kahlan asked, tapping him on the back of his shoulder. “General,could you do me a great personal favor?”“Well, of course, Mother Confessor,” he stammered. “Anything. What is it I cando?”Kahlan gestured out at the dance area and the soldiers and Sisters ringing it.“Would you please dance? I know we’re supposed to be on guard for any mischief,but I think it would let the men see the true festive nature of this party, weretheir general to go out there and dance.”“Dance?”“Yes. Please?”“But, I-that is, I don’t know how. . .”“Oh, do please stop trying to get out of it.” Kahlan turned, as if suddenlystruck with a thought. “Cara. Would you go out there with him and dance so hismen will see that it’s all right to join in?”Cara’s blue eyes shifted between Kahlan and the general. “Well, I don’t seehow-”“Do it for me? Please, Cara?” Kahlan turned back to the general. “I believe Iheard someone mention that your given name is Benjamin?”He scratched his temple. “That’s right, Mother Confessor.”Kahlan turned back to Cara. “Cara, Benjamin, here, needs a-partner for a dance.How about you? Please? Do it for me?”Cara cleared her throat. “Well, all right. For you, then, Mother Confessor.”“And don’t break his ribs, or anything. We have need of his talents.”Cara scowled back over her shoulder as a smiling Benjamin led her away.Kahlan folded her arms and grinned as she watched the man take Cara in his arms.It was just about a perfect day. Just about.Kahlan was watching Benjamin gracefully swirl Cara around, and other soldierspulling suddenly shy Sisters out of the line at the edge of the dance area, whenCaptain Ryan stumbled up.He straightened before her. “Mother Confessor . . . uh, well, we’ve been througha lot together and, if I’m not being too forward, could I ask you to . . . youknow, dance?”Kahlan blinked in surprise at the tall, young, broad Galean.“Why, yes, Bradley, I would love to dance with you. I would love it. But only ifyou promise not to hold me like I’m made of glass. I don’t want to look foolishout there.”He grinned and nodded. “All right.”She placed one hand in his, and laid the other over his shoulder. He put his bighand to the side of her waist, under her open fur mantle, and twirled her outamid the merrymakers. Kahlan smiled and laughed as she endured it. She thoughtof Spirit, and willed herself to remember that kind of strength, and she wasable to relax, and take the party for what it was, and not think about what wasmissing as another man held her in his arms, if timidly.“Bradley, you’re a wonderful dancer.”Pride shined in his eyes. She felt him loosen up, and let the music flow moresmoothly through his movements. Kahlan caught sight of Cara and Benjamin, notfar away, doing their best to dance and not look at each other. When he whirledher around him, his arm securely holding her waist, Cara’s long blond braidsailed out behind her. Then Kahlan actually saw Cara look up into Benjamin’sblue eyes and smile.Kahlan was relieved when the song ended and Captain Ryan was replaced for thenext dance by Zedd. She held him close as she moved to a slower tune with him.“I’m proud of you, Mother Confessor. You gave a wonderful thing to these men.”“And what is that?”“Your heart.” He tilted his head. “See them watching you? You’ve given themcourage. You’ve given them a reason to believe in what they’re doing.”Kahlan lifted an eyebrow. “You trickster, you. You may fool others, but not me.It is you who has given me heart.”Zedd only smiled. “You know, not since the very first Confessor has a man everagain figured out how to love such a woman without her power destroying him. I’mglad it was my grandson who accomplished such an exploit, and that it was forhis love of you. I love you as a granddaughter, Kahlan, and look forward to theday when you are back with my grandson.”Kahlan held Zedd close, resting her head against his shoulder, as they bothdanced on with their memories.As the dancing went on, the golden setting sun was finally replaced by torchesand warm fires. Sisters changed partners after each dance, and still there werejovial men lined up out of sight waiting a turn, and not just with the younger,more attractive Sisters. Cooks’ helpers set out simple fare on food tables,sampling some and joking with the soldiers as they went about their task.Between dances, Warren and Verna tried the variety of food from differenttables.Kahlan danced once more with Captain Ryan, and once more with Zedd, but thenbusied herself speaking to officers and soldiers alike so she wouldn’t have todance with anyone, should anyone feel awkward about asking her, yet work up thenerve. She was more able to enjoy the festivities without having to dance.As she was greeting a line of young officers, and they were telling her how muchthey appreciated the party, someone tapped Kahlan on the shoulder. She turned toa smiling Warren.“Mother Confessor, I would be honored were you to have a dance with me.”Kahlan noticed Verna dancing with Zedd. This was one dance that would bedifferent. “Warren, I would love to dance with the handsome groom.”He moved smoothly with her, not at all haltingly as she had expected. He seemedto be blissfully at peace, and not nervous about the crush of people or the menconstantly clapping him on the back, or the joking remarks from some of theSisters.“Mother Confessor, I just wanted to thank you for making this the best day I’veever had.”Kahlan smiled up into his young face, his ageless eyes. “Warren, thank you foragreeing to this big party. I know it’s not the sort of thing that fits you-”“Oh, but it is. That’s just it. People used to call me the mole.”“They did? Why?”“Because I used to stay down in the vaults all the time studying the prophecies.It wasn’t just that I liked to study the books-I was afraid to come out.”“But you finally did.”He turned her in time with the sweep of music. “Richard brought me out.”“He did? I never knew that.”“In a way, you’ve helped add to what he started.” Warren smiled distantly. “Ijust wanted to thank you. I know how much I miss him, and how much Verna misseshim. I know the men miss their Lord Rahl.”Kahlan was only able to nod.“And I know how much you miss your husband. That’s why I wanted to thank you-forgiving us this, and the gift of your grace, despite your heartache. Everyonehere feels it with you. Please know that while you miss him, you are not alone,and are among those who love him too.”Kahlan smiled, and managed to get out a “Thank you.”As they danced across the open area, laughing at the merry tune and the awkwardsteps of some of the soldiers, the music abruptly trailed off.It was then that she heard the horns.Alarm swept through the assembled soldiers, as men ran for their weapons, untilone of the sentries sprinted in, waving his arm, calling out for everyone tostand down, that it was friendly forces.Puzzled, Kahlan stretched her neck along with everyone else, trying to see. Theyhad no forces out. She had let them all be present to enjoy the wedding party.The crowd parted as horses trotted through the throng. Kahlan’s eyebrows wentup, and her jaw dropped. The distinguished General Baldwin, commander of allKeltish forces, was at the fore, riding a handsome chestnut gelding. He broughtthe horse to a smart halt. He ran his first finger along the length of hiswhite-flecked dark mustache as he took in the crowd gathered in around him. Hisgraying black hair grew down over his ears, and his pate shone through on top.He was a striking figure in his serge cape fastened on one shoulder with twobuttons, allowing it to show the rich green silk lining. His tan surcoat wasdecorated with a heraldic emblem slashed through with a diagonal black linedividing a yellow and blue shield. The man’s high boots were rolled down belowhis knees. Long black gauntlets, their flared cuffs lying over the front, weretucked behind a wide belt set with an ornate buckle.The press of men made way for Kahlan to step through. “General!”He lifted a hand in his noble manner, a smile spreading wide. “Mother Confessor,how good to see you.”Kahlan started to speak, but horses charged through, the crowd falling back forthem. They stormed into the dance area like a wind-borne fire-a dozen Mord-Sithin red leather. One of the women leaped from her horse.“Rikka!” Cara called out.The woman’s bold glare swept over the gathered people. She finally settled hergaze, taking in Cara. Cara moved out of General Meiffert’s arms.“Cara,” she said as way of greeting. She glanced around. “Where is Hania?”Cara stepped closer. “Hania? She’s not here.”The woman pressed her lips together in bitter disappointment. “I thought asmuch. When I never received word back, I feared we had lost her. Still, I washoping. . .”Kahlan stepped forward, a little miffed that the woman saw fit to step in frontof General Baldwin. “Rikka, is it?”“Ah,” Rikka said, a knowing smile stealing onto her face, “You could be noneother than Lord Rahl’s wife-the Mother Confessor. I recognize the description.”The woman saluted casually with a fist to her heart. “Yes, I am Rikka.”“I’m glad to have you here, and your sisters of the Agiel.”“I came from Aydindril as soon as Berdine received your letter. It explained alot. She and I discussed it, and decided I should come with some of my sistersto help in our effort. I left six sister Mord-Sith with Berdine to watch overAydindril and the Wizard’s Keep. I also brought twenty thousand troops.” Shelifted a thumb, pointing with it behind her. “We met up with the general, here,a week back.”“We can certainly use your help. That was wise of Berdine-I know how eager shewas to come herself, but she knows the city and the Keep. I’m glad she followedmy instructions.” Kahlan settled her most unsettling Mother-Confessor-gaze onRikka. “Now, if you don’t mind, you interrupted General Baldwin.”Cara shoved Rikka, pushing her back out of the way. “We need to talk, Rikka,before you’re up to the task of serving Lord Rahl and his wife, who just happensto be a sister of the Agiel.”Rikka lifted and eyebrow in surprise. “Really? How could-”“Later,” Cara said with a smile before Rikka could get herself into any moretrouble, moving the woman and her sister Mord-Sith back. Zedd, Adie, and Vernaeased closer to Kahlan.General Baldwin, now off his horse, stepped forward at last and went to a kneein a bow. “My queen, Mother Confessor.”“Rise, my child,” Kahlan said in formal answer as the camp looked on with thesame rapt attention they had devoted to the wedding. This had important bearingon them, too.The general rose to his feet. “I came as soon as I received your letter, MotherConfessor.”“How many men did you bring?”He looked surprised by the question. “Why . . . all of them. One hundred seventythousand men. When my queen asks for an army, I bring her one.”Whispers spread through the men as they passed word back.Kahlan was stunned. She no longer even felt the cold. “That’s wonderful,General. They are sorely needed. We have a real fight on our hands, as Iexplained in my letter. The Imperial Order is getting reinforcements all thetime. We need to cut those lines.”“I understand. With the D’Harans from Aydindril come with us, we can just abouttriple the size of your force down here.”“And we can still bring more in from D’Hara,” General Meiffert said.Kahlan felt the hot spark of faith in their chances swelling within her breast.“By spring, for sure, we will need them.” She cocked her head at GeneralBaldwin. “What about Lieutenant Leiden?”“Who? Oh, you must mean Sergeant Leiden. He only has a scout patrol, now. When aman deserts his queen, he’s lucky to keep his head, but he acted to protect herpeople, so I sent him to guard some remote pass. I hope the man dresses warmly.”Kahlan wanted to throw her arms around the dashing General Baldwin. Instead, shetouched her fingers to his arm in a gesture of her gratitude. “Thank you,General. We surely need the men.”“Well, they’re up country a little ways, half a day back. Couldn’t fit them allin here with your army.”“That’s fine.” Kahlan waggled her fingers, calling the Mord-Sith forward. “I’mvery glad to see you, too, Rikka. With Mord-Sith, we can better handle the enemygifted. We may even be able to turn the tide. Cara, here, has helped eliminatesome of the gifted already, but I’m afraid that Lord Rahl has her under ordersto protect me. She will continue in that capacity. But you will be free to goafter their gifted.”Rikka bowed. “Love to.” She came up and smiled. “Berdine warned me about her,”she said under her breath to Cara.“You should listen to Berdine,” Cara said, clapping her on the back. “Come, I’llhelp you find some quarters-”“No,” Kahlan said, stopping them in their tracks. “This is a party. The general,Rikka, and her sisters are invited. In fact, I insist.”“Well,” Rikka said, brightening, “as long as we’re protecting Lord Rahl’s wife,we would be only to happy to stay.”Kahlan took Rikka’s arm and pulled her close. “Rikka, we have a lot of men here,and few women. This is a dance. Get out there and dance.”“What! Are you out of your-”Kahlan shoved her out into the dance area. She snapped her fingers at themusicians. “Shall we resume?” She turned to General Baldwin. “General, you havecome at a wonderful time, a time of celebration. Please, would you dance withme?”“Mother Confessor?”“I am your queen, also. Generals dance with queens, do they not?”He smiled and offered his arm. “Of course they do, my queen.”Long after it was dark, the wedding procession made its way through themakeshift streets, greeting all the men. Thousands of soldiers congratulatedWarren and Verna on their marriage, offered jesting advice, a gentle slap on theback, or just a merry wave.Kahlan recalled a time when the Midlands feared these men. Under Darken Rahl,they were a formidable invader; inspiring dread and terror. She was amazed athow civil these men could be, how human, when given a chance. It was Richard,really, who had given them that chance. She knew that many of them understoodthat, and appreciated it.When finally they reached the end of the long winding walk through the sprawlingcamp, they came at last to the tent Verna and Warren thought was to be theirs.Those following along bid the couple a good night and wandered back to theparty, leaving the three of them alone.Rather than let Verna and Warren slow, Kahlan stepped between them, took eachunder an arm, and guided them onto the path among the towering trees. Moonlightthrough the boughs cast wavering patterns on the snow. Not knowing what she wasup to, neither Verna nor Warren protested as Kahlan kept them moving.Finally, Kahlan spotted the lodge off through the trees. She stopped a littledistance away to let them see the candlelight coming from behind the lace-likecurtain. The juxtaposition against life in an army camp made it looked all themore romantic.“This is a long and difficult struggle,” Kahlan told them. “Starting a marriageunder these conditions is a harsh burden. I can’t tell you how happy I am thatyou two chose to go forward with it at a time like this. It means a great dealto all of us. We’re all very happy for you. More than anything, I would like tothank you both for choosing life in all its glory.“We will one day have to move on, as surely the Order will move again whenspring comes, if not before. But for now, I want this place to be yours. I cangive you at least this much, this little piece of a normal life together.”Verna unexpectedly burst into tears and buried her face in Kahlan’s shoulder.Kahlan patted the Prelate’s heaving back, chuckling at how out of character itwas for Verna to show such emotion.“Not a good idea, Verna, to let your new husband see you cry just as he’s aboutto take you to his bed.”That did it, and Verna laughed, too. She gripped Kahlan’s shoulders as shesearched her eyes.“I don’t know what to say.”Kahlan kissed her cheek. “Love each another, be good to each other, and treasurebeing together-that’s what I would like more than anything.”Warren hugged her, whispering his thanks in her ear. Kahlan watched as he ledVerna the remaining distance to the lodge. At the door, both turned and waved.At the last moment, Warren swept Verna off her feet. Her lilting laugh driftedamong the trees as he carried her through the doorway.Alone, Kahlan turned back to the camp."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 44The door opened a crack. One bloodshot eye peered out into the dingy hall.“You have a room? My wife and I are looking for a room.” Before the man couldclose the door, Richard quickly added, “We were told you had one.”“What of it?”Despite it being self-evident, Richard answered politely. “We’ve no place tostay.”“Why bring your problems to me?”Richard could hear angry words going back and forth between a man and womanupstairs. Behind several of the doors in the hall, babies wailed without pause.The heavy odor of rancid oil hung in the dank air. Out the door at the backstanding open to the narrow alley, young children, being chased by olderchildren, squealed as they ran through the cold rain.Richard spoke without expectation into the narrow slit. “We need a room.”A dog not far up the alleyway barked with monotonous persistence.“Lots of people need a room. I only have one. I can’t give it to you.”Nicci eased Richard aside and put her face close to the crack.“We have the money for the first week.” She shoved her hand against the doorwhen he started to shut it. “It’s a public room. Your duty is to help the publicget rooms.”The man shouldered his weight into the door, shutting it in her face.Richard turned away as Nicci began knocking. “Forget it,” he said. “Let’s go geta loaf of bread.”Nicci usually followed his lead without admonishment, challenge, or evencomment, but this time, instead of minding him, she rapped persistently on thedoor. Layers of peeling paint, every color from blue to yellow to red, fell fromunder her knuckles.“It’s your duty,” Nicci called to the closed door. “You’ve no right to turn usaway.” No answer came. “We’re going to report you.”The door opened a crack again. The eye glared out with menace.“Has he a job?”“No, but-”“You go away. The both of your I’ll report you!”“For what, might I ask?”“Look, lady, I got a room, but I got to keep it for people at the top of thelist.”“How do you know we’re not at the top of the list?”“Because if you were you would have said so first off and showed me the approvalyou got with a seal on it. People at the head of the list have been waiting along time for a place. You’re no better than a thief, trying to take the placeof a good citizen who’s followed the law. Now, go away, or I will take down yournames for the lodging inspector.”The door slammed shut again. The threat of having their names taken downappeared to take some of the fight out of Nicci. She huffed a sigh as theywalked away, the bowed floor creaking and groaning underfoot. At least they hadbeen able to get in out of the rain for a brief time.“We will have to keep looking,” she told him. “If you had a job, first, it wouldprobably help. Maybe tomorrow you can look for a job while I keep looking for aroom.”Out in the cold rain once more, they crossed the muddy street to the cobbledwalkway on the other side. There were yet more places to check, though Richarddidn’t hold out any hope of getting a room. They’d had doors shut in their facesmore times than he could count. Nicci wanted a room, though, so they keptlooking.The weather was unusually cold for this far south in the Old World, Nicci hadtold him. People said the cold spell and rain would soon pass. A few days beforeit had been muggy and warm, so Richard had no reason to doubt their judgment. Itwas disorienting for him to see woods and fields of lush green vegetation in thedead of winter. There were some trees with limbs bare for the season, but mostwere in full leaf.As far south as they were in the Old World, it never got cold enough for waterto freeze. People only blinked dumbly when he spoke of snow. When Richardexplained snow as flakes of frozen white water that fell from the sky andcovered the ground with a cottony blanket, some people turned huffy, thinking hewas making a joke at their expense.He knew that back home winter would be raging. Despite the turmoil around him,Richard felt an inner tranquillity knowing that Kahlan was most likely to bewarm and snug in the house he had built; in that light, nothing in his new lifewas of enough importance to distress him. She had food to eat, firewood to keepher warm, and Cara for company. For now, she was safe. Winter was wearing on andin spring she would be able to leave, but, for now, Richard was confident thatshe was safe. That, and his thoughts and memories of her, were his only solace.People without rooms huddled in the alleyways, using whatever scrap of solidmaterial they could find to prop up over themselves for a roof. Walls werefashioned from sodden blankets. He supposed that he and Nicci could continue todo the same, but he feared Nicci falling ill in the cold and wet-feared thatthen Kahlan, too, would fall ill.Nicci checked the paper she carried. “These places on this register they gave usare all supposed to be available for people newly arrived-not just for people ona list. They need workers; they should be more diligent in seeing to it thatplaces are available. Do you see, Richard? Do you see how hard it is forordinary people to get along in life?”Richard, hands shoved in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the wind andrain, asked, “So, how do we get on a list?”“We will have to go to a lodging office and request a room. They can put us on ahousing list.”It sounded simple, but matters were proving far more complex than they sounded.“If there aren’t enough rooms, how will being on a list get us a place to stay?”“People die all the time.”“There’s work here, that’s why we came-that’s why everyone else has come. I’llwork hard and then we can afford to pay more. We still have a little money. Wejust need to find a place that wants to rent a room for the right price-withoutall this list foolishness.”“Really, Richard, are you that inhumane? How would those less fortunate ever getrooms, then? The Order sets the prices to stop profiteers. They make sure thereis no favoritism. That makes it fair for all. We just need to get on a list fora room, and then everything will be fine.”Watching the glistening cobbles before him as he walked, Richard wondered howlong they would be without a place until their name worked its way to the top ofa list. It looked to him as if a lot of people would need to die before his andNicci’s names came up for a room-with more yet waiting in turn for them to die.He stepped first to one side and then the other to avoid bumping into the riverof people swirling past, making their way in the opposite direction while tryingto stay out of the mud of the street. He considered again staying outside thecity-a lot of people did that. But there were outlaws and desperate peopleaplenty who preyed on those who were forced to stay out in the open where therewere no city guards. Were Nicci not opposed to the idea, Richard would havefound a place farther out and built a shelter, perhaps with some other people sothat they could together discourage trouble.Nicci wasn’t interested in the idea. Nicci wanted to be in the city. Multitudescame to the city looking for a better life. There were lists to get on, andlines to wait in to see official people. You had a better chance of doing thosethings if you had a room in the city, she said.It was getting late in the day. The line at the bakery was out the door andpartway down the block.“Why are all these people in line?” Richard whispered to Nicci. It was the sameevery day when they went to buy bread.She shrugged. “I guess there aren’t enough bakeries.”“Seems like with all the customers, more people would want to open bakeries.”Nicci leaned close, a scolding scowl darkening her brow. “The world isn’t assimple as you would like it to be, Richard. It used to be that way in the OldWorld. Man’s evil nature was allowed to flourish. People set their own pricesfor goodswith greed being their only interest, not the good of their fellow man.Only the wellto-do could afford to buy bread. Now, the Order sees to it thateveryone gets needed goods for a fair price. The Order cares about everyone, notjust those with unfair advantages.”She always seemed so impassioned when she spoke about the evil nature of people.Richard wondered why a Sister of the Dark would care about evil, but he didn’tbother to ask.The line wasn’t moving very fast. The woman in front of him, suspicious of theirwhispering, scowled back over her shoulder.Richard met her glare with a broad smile.“Good afternoon, ma’am.” Her somber scowl faltered in the light of his beaminggrin. “We’re new in town”-he gestured behind-”my wife and I. I’m looking forwork. We need a room, though. Would you know how a young couple, strangers tothe city, could go about getting a room?”She half turned, holding her canvas bag in both hands, letting it pull her armsstraight as she leaned her shoulders against the wall. Her bag held only ayellow wedge of cheese. Richard’s smile and his friendly conversationaltone-artificial though they were-were apparently so out of the ordinary that sheseemed unable to maintain her gruff demeanor.“You have to have a job if you hope to get a room. There aren’t enough rooms inthe city, what with all the new workers come for the abundance provided by thewisdom of the Order. If you’re able-bodied, you need to have work, then they’llput your name on the list.”Richard scratched his head and kept smiling as the line slowly shuffled along.“I’m eager to work.”“Easier to get a room if you can’t work,” the woman confided.“But, I thought you just said you had to have a job if you were to have any hopeof getting a room.”“That’s true, if you’re able, like you look to be. Those folks with a greaterneed, because they can’t do for themselves, are rightly entitled to benevolenceand to be put higher on the list-like my husband, the poor man. He’s afflictedterrible like with consumption.”“I’m so sorry,” Richard said.She nodded with the weight of her burden. “It’s mankind’s wretched lot tosuffer. Nothing can be done about it, so there’s no use trying. Only in the nextlife will we get our reward. In this life, it’s the duty of every person withability to help those unfortunate souls with needs. In that way the able earntheir reward in the next life.”Richard didn’t argue. She shook a finger at him.“Those who can work owe it to those who can’t to do their best for the good ofall.“I can work,” Richard assured her. “We’re from . . . a little place. We’resimple folks-from farming stock. We don’t know much about how to go about thingslike getting work in the city.”“The Order has brought the people a great abundance of work,” a man behind Niccisaid, drawing Richard’s attention. The man’s oiled canvas coat was buttonedtight at his throat. His big brown eyes blinked slowly, like a cow as it chewedits cud. The way his jaw wobbled sideways as he spoke only added to theimpression. “The Order welcomes all workers to our struggle, but you must bemindful of the needs of others-as the Creator Himself wishes-and go aboutgetting work in the proper fashion.”Richard, his stomach grumbling with hunger, listened as the man explained. “Youfirst need to belong to a citizen workers’ group; they protect the rights ofcitizens of the Order. You’ll have to go before a review assembly for approvalto join the workers’ group, and a fitness panel to hear from a spokesman fromthe workers’ citizen group who can vouch for you. You must do this before youcan go for a job.”“Why can’t I just go to a place and show myself? Why can’t they hire me, if Ifit their needs?”“Just because you’re from the country, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bemindful of contributing toward the greater good of the Order.”“Of course not,” Richard said. “I’ve always worked for myself, through farmingto bring food to my fellow man, as is our duty. I don’t know how businesses dothings.”The big brown eyes paused their blinking. The man peered suspiciously for amoment, then his eyes finally went moony again. His jaw resumed its wobbling ashe chewed his words.“It’s the primary responsibility of business to be sensitive to the needs of thepeople, to contribute to the public welfare, to be equitable. The review boardhelps see to this. There is much more involved than the narrow goals ofbusinesses.”“I see,” Richard said. “Well, I’d be grateful if you could tell me how to goabout it properly.” He glanced briefly at Nicci. “I want to be a good citizenand do things right.”By the man’s pride in the explanation, and the way his big eyes blinked fasteras he laid it all out, Richard expected that the man was somehow involved in thelabyrinthine process. Richard didn’t ask how you got a spokesman from thecitizen workers’ group to vouch for you. The line inched forward as the manexplained the finer details of different sorts of work, what each required, andhow it was all for the benefit of those living within the Order and under thegrace of the Creator.As he droned on, delivering his information with smug satisfaction, Nicciwatched Richard discreetly, and without comment, as he listened to theprocedures. She looked as if she was expecting him to suddenly turn from politeto deadly. Richard knew there could be no point to a battle with this man, so heremained polite.It turned out that the man, named Mr. Gudgeons, seemed to know the most aboutthe quarry workers. Since Richard knew little about quarries, he passed the timeas they stood in line by asking a few questions that pleased Mr. Gudgeons toanswer-at great length.The store ran out of bread and closed before they got any. The line of peopledissolved into the downpour, mumbling to one another as they went about theirwoeful lot in life. Richard thanked the woman and Mr. Gudgeons before he andNicci moved on.Richard paused at a cross street while Nicci studied her paper with the list ofrooms. All around, the blocky shapes of buildings rose out of the gloom. Redpaint on the side of one brick building was so faded that it left the figurepainted there looking like a blushing ghost. The faded whitewash of wordsbeneath the vanishing man were no longer legible.Passing men gazed at Nicci in her wet clinging clothes, never seeing her face.Her hair was plastered to her skull, her jaw quivered, and her hands trembled,yet she didn’t complain about the cold, as did everyone else. They had been toldthat they couldn’t get another list, with any new rooms that might have recentlybecome available, until the next day, so Nicci was trying to keep this onewhole, but in the rain it was a losing battle.Mangy horses slogged through the mud, some of the wagons they pulled squeakingand groaning under the weight of a load. Only the main thoroughfares, like theone they were on, were wide enough to allow teams of horses and full-size wagonsto easily pass in both directions. Some streets were only wide enough for wagonsto go in one direction. Some of those, with no room to pull aside, were chokedoff by broken-down wagons. Richard saw a dead horse in one narrow street, therotting animal, attended by a cloud of flies, still hitched to its wagon as itawaited someone to come haul it away. The blocked streets only added to thecongestion of the others. Some streets, were wide enough only for handcarts. Inmany of the narrower passageways only foot traffic could fit.The smell of garbage and the stench of streets that also functioned as opensewers had been enough to gag Richard for the first week until he’d become numbto it.The alleyways where he and Nicci had slept were the worst. The rain only servedto flush the filth out of every hole and carry it out into the open, but atleast as long as he was standing it washed off some of the dirt.All the cities Richard had seen after they’d entered the Old World and traveledsouth from Tanimura were similar to this one, all suffering under grindingpoverty and inhuman conditions. Everything seemed caught in a timeless trap, amorass of rot, as if the cities had once been vibrant with life and peoplestriving to fulfill dreams, had once been places of hope and ambition, butsomewhere the dreams had disintegrated into a gray pall of stagnation and decay.No one seemed to much care. Everyone seemed in a daze, biding their time,waiting for their lot in life to improve without even having a concept of theshape of that better life or how it might come to be. They existed ondisembodied faith, confident only that the afterlife would be perfect.The cities Richard had seen were startlingly similar to what Richard envisionedthe future held for the New World under the yoke of the Order.This place, though, was the single largest city Richard had ever seen. He wouldnever have believed the size of it had he not seen it himself. Dilapidatedbuildings entangled by streets teeming with people sprawled over a sweep of lowhills, across a broad bottomland, for miles along the convergence of two rivers.Squat ramshackle huts built haphazardly of wattle and daub, scraps of wood, orsalvaged mud and straw bricks beset the city’s core to a great distance out intothe surrounding land, like fetid scum surrounding a rotting log in a stagnantpond.It was the city of Altur’Rang-the namesake of the land which was now the heartof the Old World and the Imperial Order-the home city of Emperor Jagang.When they had first entered the Old World on their way south toward Altur’Rang,Richard and Nicci had stopped at the northernmost large city in the Old World,‘Ianimura, where the Palace of the Prophets had once stood. Tanimura, one of thelast places in the Old World to fall under the rule of the Imperial Order, was agrand place, with wide boulevards lined with trees and ornate buildings soaringseveral stories high, faced with columns and arches and windows that let in thelight. Tanimura, as large as it was, turned out to be but an outpost of the OldWorld, far enough away that the rot was only now reaching it.For a span of a little over a month, Richard had found work in Tanimura as amason’s tender, one of a dozen, hauling stone and mixing mortar for a squat,unattractive building. The masons had simple huts the workers and their familieslived in, so Nicci had shelter. The master came to trust Richard to keep up withhis masons. When one of the stonecutters fell sick, Richard was asked to standin at squaring the blocks of granite for the masons.He found holding a chisel and mallet in his hands, cutting stone-shaping it tohis will-a revelation. In some ways, it was like carving wood . . . but somehowmuch more.From time to time, the master stood with fists on his hips, watching Richardchisel square edges into the hard granite. Occasionally, in a gruff voice, hewould make minor corrections to Richard’s method. After a time, as the mastersaw that Richard took to the job and could cut a block square and true, he nolonger bothered watching. Before long Richard’s blocks were chosen first by themasons as cornerstones.Other stonecutters arrived to do more demanding work-the adornments. When theyhad first shown up, Richard had been eager to see their work. They cut into theface of blocks, meant to surround the entrance, a large flame representing theLight of the Creator. Below that, they carved a crowd of cowering people.Richard had seen a number of stone carvings in the various places he had been,from the Confessors’ Palace in Aydindril to the People’s Palace in D’Hara, buthe had never seen anything like the figures he saw being cut on that building inTanimura. They were not graceful, or grand, or inspiring, but just the opposite.They were distorted, thick-limbed, cringing figures recoiling below the Light.Richard was told by one of the artisans that this was the only properrepresentation of mankind-profane, hideous, sinful. Richard kept his mind oncutting square stones.When the stonework to the Order’s headquarters building was finished, the jobended. The carpenters didn’t need any more help. The artisans said they coulduse some assistance carving the anguish of mankind and offered Richard the work.He declined, telling them that he had no ability for carving.Besides, Nicci had been eager to move on; Tanimura had only been a place to earnsome money to buy provisions for the long journey ahead of them. Richard wasglad to be away from the depressing sight of the carving going on.Along the way southeast to Altur’Rang, in the cities they passed through,Richard saw many carvings on buildings, and many more freestanding in publicsquares, or in front of entrances. They depicted horrors: people being whippedby a grinning Keeper of the underworld; people stabbing out their own eyes;suffering people twisted, deformed, and crippled; people like packs of dogs,running on all fours, attacking women and children; people reduced to walkingskeletons or covered in sores; woeful people throwing themselves into graves. Inmost such scenes the pitiful people were watched over by the Light of theall-perfect Creator represented by the flame.The Old World was a celebration of misery.Along the way south, they had stopped in a number of cities when Richard couldfind menial work temporary enough not to require waiting on lists. He and Nicciwent for stretches eating cabbage soup that was mostly water. Sometimes they hadrice or lentils or buckwheat mush, and, on occasion, the luxury of salt pork.Sometimes, Richard was able to catch fish, birds, or the odd hare. Living offthe land in the Old World, though, was difficult. A lot of other people had thesame idea. They both had gotten thinner on their long march. Richard began tounderstand the carvings of the skeletal people.Nicci had set their destination, but dictated little else, leaving mostdecisions to him, complying without complaint. Week in and week out, theywalked, occasionally paying a few copper pennies to ride in wagons headed theirway. They crossed rivers straddled by cities large enough to have numbers ofstone bridges, and went through town after town. There were vast fields ofwheat, millet, sunflower, and any number of other crops, though much of the landlay fallow. They saw flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.Farmers sold the travelers goat cheese and milk. Ever since the gift hadawakened in him, Richard was able to eat meat only when not doing any fighting.He thought it might be part of the requirement to balance his need to sometimestake life. Since he wasn’t doing any fighting, he could eat meat without itmaking him sick. Unfortunately, they could rarely afford meat. Cheese, which hehad once loved, he could hardly stomach since his gift had come to life in him.Unfortunately, it was often eat cheese, or starve.But it was the size of the Old World, and in particular its population, thatmost unsettled him. Richard had naively thought that the New and the Old Worldsmust be somewhat alike. They were not. The New World was but a flea on the backof the Old.From time to time on their journey south, vast columns of men at arms moved pastthem on their way north to the Midlands. Several times, it had taken days forall the soldiers to march past. Whenever he saw the rank upon rank of troops, hefelt a wave of relief that Kahlan was trapped in their mountain home. He wouldhate to think of her fighting in an army facing as many men as he saw going tothe war.By spring, when she could finally get out of the mountain home, and all thoseImperial Order troops could truly begin their siege of the New World, whateverresistance the D’Haran Empire put up would be crushed. Richard hoped GeneralReibisch chose not to go up against the Order. He hated to think of all thosebrave men being slaughtered under the weight of the coming onslaught.At one small city, Nicci had gone to a stream to wash their clothes whileRichard worked the day mucking out stalls at a large stable. A number ofofficials had come to town and there were more horses than the stablemastercould handle. Richard had been at the right place at the right time to get thejob. Not long after the officials arrived and took all the rooms at the inns, alarge unit of the Imperial Order troops marched in behind them and set up campat the city limits.Fortunately, Nicci was on the other side of the city doing their washing.Unfortunately, a squad of men passing through the city, and doing some drinking,decided to accept volunteers. Richard kept his head down as he carried water tothe horses, but the sergeant saw him. At the wrong place at the wrong time,Richard was “volunteered” into the Imperial Order. The new volunteers werequartered in the center of the immense encampment.That night, after it was dark and most of the men were asleep, Richardunvolunteered himself. It took him until three hours before sunrise to extracthimself from his service to the Imperial Order. Nicci had gone to the stable andfound out what had happened to him. Richard found her at their camp, pacing inthe darkness. They quickly collected their things and marched south for the restof the night. They went cross country, since the moon was out, rather than onthe roads, in case a patrol came looking for him. From then on, whenever Richardsaw soldiers he did his best to become invisible.In general, though, it wasn’t a serious concern. Hordes of youths, lusting afterthe promise of plunder, were only too eager to join the army. They often had towait weeks or months to be accepted into training, so many were the numbersjoining. Richard had seen crowds of them in the cities, playing games, gambling,drinking, fighting-young men dreaming of the glory of killing the evil foes ofthe great empire of the Order. They enjoyed the adoration of the populace whenthey joined the army to go off and fight the frightful wickedness and sin thatwas said to infect the New World.Richard was horrified to see the numbers of people living in the Old World,because it meant that the Order’s army already in the New World was hardly adrain on the populace-and only the beginning. He had thought that perhaps theOrder might lose their enthusiasm for a war conducted so far from theirhomeland, or that the people of the Old World would tire of the hardshipnecessary to conduct such a war. He now knew that thought had been but a feebledaydream.It didn’t take a wizard, or a prophet, to know that the armies the New Worldcould raise, even given wildly optimistic conditions, had no hope whatsoever ofprevailing against the millions upon millions of soldiers Richard had seenpouring north, to say nothing of the ones he hadn’t seen who would be takingother routes. The Midlands was doomed.Ever since the people of Anderith chose the Order over freedom, he had known inhis heart that the New World was going to fall to the Order. He felt nosatisfaction in realizing how right he had been. Seeing the size of the enemy,he realized that freedom was lost, and resisting the Order was but suicide.The course of events seemed irrevocable, the world lost to the Order. The futurefor him and Kahlan seemed no less hopeless.By far the strangest place he and Nicci had visited in their journey southeast,a place she never spoke of afterward, had been less than a week south ofTanimura. Richard had still been in a dismal mood thinking about the carvings hehad seen, when Nicci took an old, seldom-used track off the main road. It ledback toward the hills, to a rather small city beside a quiet river.Most of the businesses had been abandoned. The wind, at will, carried dustthrough the broken windows of warehouses. Many of the homes had fallen to ruin,their roofs caved in, weeds and vines doing their best to bring down crookedwalls. Only the homes on the outskirts were still occupied, mostly by peopleraising animals and farming the surrounding land.On the northern side of the city, one small store remained to sell staples tosurrounding farmers. There was also a leather shop, a fortune-teller, and alonely inn. In the center of town stood the bones of buildings, long sincepicked clean by scavengers. Several of the buildings still stood, but most hadlong ago collapsed. Richard and Nicci walked through the center of town watchedonly by a fitful wind.At the southern edge, they arrived at the remains of what had once been a largebrick building. Without a word, Nicci turned off the road and marcheddeliberately into the forlorn site. The wood beams and roof had been consumed byfire. A thick mat of weeds and brush were devouring the wood floor. The brickwalls were all that was left, really, and they were mostly fallen to rubble,with only a portion of the east wall still tall enough to contain a lone windowframe.The wind ruffled Nicci’s sunlit hair as she looked down the length of theskeletal remains of the building. Her arms languid at her sides, her back notquite as straight as it usually was, she stood vulnerable where once a roofwould have sheltered her.For nearly an hour, she was lost among the ghosts.Richard stood off to the side, leaning a hip against the charred remains of partof a workbench, one of the only things left inside the brick frame.“Do you know this place?” he finally asked her.She blinked at his question. She stared into his eyes for a long time, as if he,too, were a ghost. She stepped close to him then, her blue eyes finally lookingaway to let her fingers reminisce as they glided lightly over the remains of theworkbench.“I grew up in this town,” she answered in a distant voice.“Oh.” Richard gestured around them. “And this place?”“They made armor here,” she whispered.He couldn’t imagine why she would want to see such a place. “Armor?”“The best armor in all the land. Double-proofed standard. Kings and noblemencame here to buy armor.”Richard gazed around at the ruins of the place, wondering what more there mustbe to the story.“Did you know the man who made the armor?”Her blue eyes seeing ghosts again, she shook her head.“No,” she whispered. “I’m so sorry, but I never knew him.”A tear ran down her cheek to drip off her smooth jaw. She seemed very much achild at that moment, alone in the world, and frightened.Had he not known what he knew about her, Richard would have put his arms aroundthis forlorn frail child and comforted her."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 45Nicci was tired, cold, and impatient. She wanted a room.Her purpose in guiding Richard to the center of the empire in Altur’Rang was tobring him face-toface with the righteous cause of the Order. She knew Richard tobe a man of profound moral integrity, and she wanted to see how he would reactwhen confronted by the undeniable virtue of his enemy’s intentions.She wanted Richard to learn how difficult it was for ordinary people to live, toget along in the world. She was curious as to how he would fare in the samecircumstances-she wanted to throw him into the fire and see how he reacted tothe heat, as it were. She had expected him to be agitated and frustrated by now.He remained cool and unruffled.She thought he would be furious at learning what he had to do to get a job. Hewas not. He had listened to that Mr. Gudgeons fellow explaining the nearimpossible task that faced anyone wanting work. Nicci had expected him to punchthe pompous official; instead, Richard had cheerfully thanked him. It was as ifthe things he so naively stood for, so selfishly defended when she had known himbefore, no longer mattered to him.At the Palace of the Prophets when she had been his teacher, every time shethought she knew how he would react, he did something she would never haveanticipated. He did that now, too, but in a subtly different way. What beforehad been, in a manner of speaking, unorganized youthful rebellion had turned tothe dangerous scrutiny of a predator. Only the chains around his heart kept himfrom turning his claws on her.When Nicci had first captured Richard, she had briefly seen, standing in thewindow of his house, a carving of a proud woman. Nicci had known, as sure as sheknew night followed day, that Richard had carved it; it betrayed his uniquevision, which she recognized. The statue was tangible evidence of a hidden sideto his gift; it was a form of balance to his ability for war, yet she detectedno magic in it.Knowing that Richard had carved it, Nicci expected that he would have beeninterested in the carving job offered him back in Tanimura. He turned it down.He became moody and hardly spoke for several days afterward.Whenever they went through a new city, she saw him taking in the statues andrelief carvings. Since he, too, carved, she expected him to find such creationsfascinating. He did not. She couldn’t understand it. None were as finelyexecuted as what he had carved, to be sure, but still, they were carvings andshe thought he would be at least interested in them. She was baffled by his grimmood whenever he saw them.One time, she had taken the two of them out of their way for no reason but toshow him a famous city square and the heroic work of art proudly displayedthere. It was her thought to bring him a bit of cheer at seeing such a widelyheralded work. He was not cheered. Surprised, she had asked him why he appearedto so dislike the sculpture, called Tormented Vision.“It’s death,” he had said with distant revulsion as he turned away from thewidely worshiped work.It was a grand scene of a group of men, some gouging out their eyes after havingseen the perfect Light of the Creator. Other of the men at the base of thestatue, who’d not blinded themselves, were being mauled by underworld beasts.The Keeper’s minions shrank from the blinded men wailing at what they had seenbefore taking their own sight.“No,” Nicci said, trying not to laugh and thereby humiliate him for hisunenlightened view. She sought instead to gently rectify his perception of thefamous work by explaining it to him.“It’s a portrayal of the unworthy nature of mankind. It shows men who have justwitnessed His perfect Light, and in so doing have thus been able to see thehopeless nature of man’s depravity. That they would cut out their own eyes showshow perfect the Creator is that they could no longer bear to look uponthemselves.“These men in the statue are heroes for showing us that we must not arrogantlyendeavor to rise above our corrupt essence, for that would be sinfully comparingourselves to the Creator. It shows that we are but faceless, insignificant partsof a greater whole of mankind, which He created, and thus no single life canhold any importance. This work teaches us that only the society as a whole canbe worthwhile. Those at the bottom, here, who failed to join in with theirfellow man and blind themselves, are suffering their grim eternal fate at theKeeper’s hands.“Do you see, now? It honors mankind as the flawed creature he is, in order thatwe may see that each of us must devote ourselves to the betterment of our fellowman because that is our only means of doing good and honoring the Creator’screation-us. So, you see, it’s not about death at all, but about the true natureof life.”Nicci had been taught that the statue was uplifting for the people, since itconfirmed everything they knew to be true.In the whole of her life, no one had ever given her a look that made her feelsmaller than the look Richard gave her.Nicci swallowed in horror at that look in his eyes-it was the complete oppositeof that elusive thing she sought from him. Without saying a word, he had madeher want nothing so much at that moment as to crawl under a rock and die.She couldn’t fathom how, but he made her feel unworthy to live. In somebewildering way, that look made her feel as blind as the men in the statue. Hehadn’t said one word, but it was days before she could bring herself to look himin the eye again.Sometimes, Richard seemed meek when she expected fierceness, and intense whenshe expected indifference. She was beginning to wonder if she had been mistakenin thinking there was something special about him.Once, she had even given in to despair of there really being anything in himworth discovering. Watching him sleep, dejected that she had dared hope touncover some meaning to life beyond what her mother had taught her, she hadsadly resolved that the next day, after visiting the place she had grown up, shewould end the whole senseless undertaking and return to Jagang.After they went to her father’s business, though, she had seen again thatquality in his gray eyes, and knew beyond doubt that she had not been mistaken.This dance had only begun.As they marched down the dim hallway of a rooming house, she gestured forRichard to stand aside. Nicci wanted this room. She wanted to lie down where itwas dry and go to sleep. She resolutely rapped her knuckles on a door thatlooked as if it might come apart if she wasn’t careful.She peered down at the register she had and then stuffed it in her pack as shewaited for the door to be answered. The lodging house, like all the others theyhad been to, was supposed to let rooms to those new to the city. The emperorneeded workers.In her mind, she imagined that this would be the place. She stared at the stainon the sickly green plaster. She imagined seeing the tea-colored stain, in theshape of a horse’s rump with its tail flicked up, every day as she went abouther life. She imagined Richard walking past the stain every day when he went toa job, and every night when he came home. Just like everyone else had to do.Richard was watching the stairway beyond the door where Nicci again knocked. Thestairs faced away. She couldn’t understand why he watched all the things hewatched, but she didn’t discount his instincts. By the look on his face, hewasn’t pleased about the shadowed stairway. Being a Sister of the Dark, she washardly frightened by the simple things that frightened other people. She knockedagain.A voice inside told them to go away.“We need a room,” Nicci declared to the door in a tone that said she meant tohave it. She knocked harder. “You’re on the register. We want the room.”“It’s a mistake,” came the muffled voice from inside. “No room.”“Now look here,” Nicci called out heatedly, “it’s getting late-”Three youths she hadn’t seen sitting on the stairs swaggered around the newelpost. The three were without shirts, showing off their muscles as young men werewont to do. All three had knives.“Well, well,” one of the youths said with a cocky grin as his eyes took her inwith lewd intent. “What have we here? Two little drowned rats?”“I like the fancy tail on the little blond rat,” a second chortled.Richard seized her arm and without a word shepherded her out the front door,back out into the rain. Nicci dragged her heels, protesting in a whisper thewhole way. She couldn’t believe that Lord Rahl himself, the Seeker of Truth, andthe bringer of death would be intimidated by three men-boys, really.As they descended the rickety front stoop, Richard lifted an eyebrow at herwhile tipping his head close. “You have no power, remember? We don’t want thiskind of trouble. I’d not like to get knifed over a room. This fight isn’t worthit. Knowing when not to fight is just as important as knowing how.”Nicci wanted the room, but she finally conceded that Richard was probably right.The three sneering youths slouched at the door and watched, laughing, callingRichard names. So far, they weren’t interested in going out in the rain. She hadseen young men like them before. This latest crop was no different from any ofthe others-arrogant, aggressive, and often dangerous. At least they made goodsoldiers for Jagang’s army.Richard hurried her along the street. He cut through some of the narrowpassageways, taking several turns at random just to be sure they wouldn’t befollowed.The city of Altur’Rang seemed endless. In the overcast and rain, visibility waslimited. The haphazard streets and byways were a confusing maze. It had beenmany years since she had been here last. With all the Order’s efforts, the placestill had fallen on hard times. She feared to think of what it would have beenlike had the Order not been here to help.When they emerged on a wider street, they found shelter under a smalloverhanging roof along with a small group of others trying to stay out of therain. Nicci hugged herself against the cold. Richard, along with the othershuddled under the roof, watched the occasional wagon making its way past on themuddy street. She didn’t know how Richard could keep warm in such weather. Sheappreciated his warmth, though, when the small crowd pressed her up against him.Richard glanced down at her, seeing her shiver, but he couldn’t bring himself toput an arm around her to help keep her warns. She didn’t ask.Nicci sighed; the Old World didn’t stay cold for long. In another day or two itwould again be warm and muggy.When she had been at the crumbled remains of her father’s business, just beforethey left, Richard had looked as if he almost wanted to put his arms around herand comfort her. As much as he hated her, as much as he wanted to get away fromher, he had been moved to sympathy.Standing in the ruins, Nicci had let the memories wash through her, and hadreveled in the exquisite anguish.Richard’s eyes were fixed on something. She followed his gaze and saw that awagon not far down the street was moving with an odd wiggle. Almost as soon asshe noticed it, the wheel broke with a loud crack.With the strain imposed by the wagon slipping and being twisted in the ruts, thespokes had snapped under the heavy load. The side of the wagon bed dropped witha splash. People on the walkway were splattered with mud. They cursed the twomen in the wagon. The four-horse team struggled to a halt as the uneven loadbroke the axle, causing the good rear wheel to snap its spokes, too. The wholerear of the wagon collapsed into the mud.The two men climbed down to assess the damage. The rawboned driver cursed andkicked at the broken wheel lying at a lopsided angle. The other man, shorter andstoutly built, calmly checked the rest of the wagon and its load.With a frown of curiosity, Richard nudged Nicci ahead of him as he moved downthe street toward the wagon. She went reluctantly, unhappy to be out from underthe roof.“We have to,” the husky man said with calm resolve. “It’s only a shortdistance.”The other cursed again. “It’s not my job, Ishaq, and you know it. I’ll not doit!”Then Ishaq threw up his hands in a helpless gesture as his headstrong partnerwent to the front of the wagon and urged the team on, managing to drag the wagonto the side of the road and out of the way of the other wagons that werebeginning to back up down the street. Once he had the wagon to the side, hestarted unhitching the team.The man at the back of the wagon turned and peered around at the peoplewatching.“I need some help,” Ishaq called to the sparse crowd.“Doing what?” a nearby man asked.“I’ve got to get this load of iron to the warehouse.” He stretched his thickneck and pointed. “Just there-in the brick building with the faded red paint onthe side.”“How much will you pay?” the bystander asked.Ishaq was getting frustrated as he glanced over his shoulder and saw his partnerleading the horses away. “I’m not authorized to pay anything, not withoutapproval, but I’m sure that if you came round tomorrow-”The people watching laughed with knowing disgust and went on their way. The manstood in the downpour, ankle deep in mud, alone. He sighed and turned to hiswagon, pulling back the tarp to reveal iron bar stock.Richard stepped out into the street. Nicci wanted to check some more rooms onthe list before it got dark. She snatched at his sleeve, but he only gave her ascolding look. She huffed her displeasure but followed anyway as he made his waythrough the mud to the man struggling to pull a long bar from the wagon bed.“Ishaq, is it?” Richard asked.The man turned and gave Richard a nod. “That’s right.”“If I help you, Ishaq,” Richard asked, “will I really get paid tomorrow? Thetruth, now.”Ishaq, a stocky fellow with a curious red hat with a narrow brim all around,finally shook his head in resignation.“Well,” Richard said, “if I help you get this load into your warehouse, thenwould you allow me and my wife to sleep in there where we could get out of therain for the night?”The man scratched his neck. “I’m not allowed to let anyone in there. What ifsomething happened? What if things came up missing? I’d be out of work”-hesnapped his fingers-”quick as that.”“Just until tomorrow. I only want to get her out of the rain before she comesdown sick. I have no use for iron. Besides, I don’t rob people.”The man scratched his neck again as he gazed back at the wagon over hisshoulder. He glanced at Nicci. She was shivering and it was not an act. Hepeered at Richard.“Sleeping in the warehouse for one night is not a fair price for lugging allthis in there. It will take hours.”“If you agree to it, and I agree to it,” Richard said over the sound of therain, “then it’s a fair price. I asked for no more, and I’m willing to do it forthat price.”The man stared at Richard as if he might be crazy. He pulled off his red hat andscratched his head of dark hair. He swept his wet hair back and replaced thehat.“You would have to clear out when I come first thing in the morning with a newwagon. I could get in trouble-”“I’ll not let you get in trouble over me. If I should get caught, I’ll say Ibroke in.”The man thought about it for a moment, looking surprised at the last termRichard had thrown in an effort to close the deal. The man took another lookover his shoulder at the load, then nodded his consent.Ishaq hoisted a long bar of steel and put his shoulder under it. Richard liftedtwo and extended his arm forward to steady it, resting the heavy steel on thebunched muscles of his shoulder.“Come on,” he said to Nicci. “Let’s get you inside where you can start to dryout and get warm.”She tried to lift a steel bar to help, but it was beyond her strength. Therewere times when Nicci missed her power. She could at least feel it through thelink to the Mother Confessor. It took more effort, but even at this great of adistance she was still able to maintain the link. She walked beside Richard asthey followed the man to the dry room Richard had just won for her.The next day dawned clear. Rainwater still dripped from the eaves, though. Thenight before, as Richard helped Ishaq lug the load into the warehouse, Nicci hadused a light rope Richard had in his pack, stringing it between racks so shecould hang up their wet things. By morning, most of their clothes werereasonably dry.They’d slept on wooden pallets, the only other choice being the dirt. Everythingsmelled of iron dust, and was covered with a fine black film. There was nothingin the warehouse to keep them warm, other than a single lantern Ishaq had leftthem, over which Nicci could at least warm her hands. They slept as best theycould in their wet clothes. By morning, those, too, were reasonably dry.Much of the night, Nicci hadn’t slept, but, by the light of that lantern warningher hands, had watched Richard sleep as she thought about his gray eyes. It hadbeen a shock to see those eyes in her father’s business. It brought back a floodof memories.Richard opened the warehouse door just enough to squeeze through and carriedtheir things out into the breaking dawn. The sky over the city looked as if itwere rusting. He left her to watch their things while he went back in to lockthe door from inside. She could hear him climbing the racks in the warehouse toget up to a window. He had to jump to the ground.When Ishaq finally came up the street with the fresh wagon, Richard and Nicciwere sitting on a short wall on the entrance road to the warehouse doors. Whenthe wagon rolled past them into the yard outside the building and came to a haltbefore the double doors, Nicci saw that the driver who had abandoned Ishaq thenight before was at the reins.The lanky driver set the brake as he eyed them suspiciously.“What’s this?” he asked Richard.“I’m sorry to bother you,” Richard said, “but I just wanted to get here beforeyou opened up so I could inquire if there might be any work available.”Ishaq glanced at Nicci, seeing that she was dried out. He eyed the locked doorand realized Richard had kept his word, and kept him from the possibility ofgetting in trouble for letting someone sleep in the warehouse.“We can’t hire people,” the driver said. “You have to go to the office and putyour name on the list.”Richard sighed. “I see. Well, thank you, gentlemen. I’ll give it a try. A goodday to you both.”Nicci had learned to recognize in Richard’s voice when he was up to something.He gazed up the street, and then down the street, as if he were lost. He was upto something, now. He seemed to be giving Ishaq an opportunity to offer morethan he had paid for the help. Ishaq had let Richard carry twice as much of theload the night before. Richard had done so without a word of protest.Ishaq cleared his throat. “Hold on there.” He climbed down from the wagon tounlock the door, but paused before Richard. “I’m the load master. We needanother man. You look to have a strong back.” Using the toe of his boot, he drewa little map in the mud. “You go to the office”-he lifted his thumb over hisshoulder”down this street, here, to the third turn, then right, past six morestreets.” He made an X in the mud. “There’s the office. You get your name on thelist.”Richard smiled and bowed his head. “I’ll do that, sir.”Nicci knew that Richard remembered Ishaq’s name, but he was playing like hedidn’t for the sake of the driver, whom Richard didn’t trust, after the man hadabandoned his fellow the night before. What Richard didn’t understand was thatthe driver had only done what he was supposed to do. It was not permitted forone man to take the work that belonged to others. That was stealing. The loadwas the responsibility of the load man, not the driver.“You go enlist first in the load workers’ group,” Ishaq told Richard. “Pay yourdues. They have an office in the same building. Then you go put your name on thelist for the job. I’m in the citizen workers’ group that goes before the reviewassembly to consider new applicants. You just sit tight and wait outside. Whenwe meet, later on, I’ll vouch for you.”The driver leaned out and spat over the far side of the wagon. “Why you want togo and do that, Ishaq? You don’t even know this fellow.”Ishaq scowled up at the driver. “Did you see anyone at the hall who was as bigas this fellow? We need another loader for the warehouse. We just lost a man andneed a replacement. You want me to get stuck with some skinny old man so as I’llhave to do all the work?”The driver chuckled. “Suppose not.”Ishaq gestured toward Nicci. “Besides, look at his young wife. She needs somemeat on her bones, don’t you think? Looks like a nice young couple.”The driver spat over the side of the wagon again. “I suppose.”Ishaq casually flicked a hand at Richard on his way to unlock the door to thewarehouse. “You be there.”“I’ll be there.”Ishaq paused and turned back. “Almost forgot-what’s your name?”“Richard Cypher.”Ishaq gave him a nod and turned back to the door. “I’m Ishaq. See you tonight,Richard Cypher. Don’t you let me down-you hear? You turn out to be lazy and letme down, and I’ll throw your sorry hide in the river with an iron bar tiedaround your neck.”“I won’t let you down, Ishaq.” Richard smiled. “I’m a good swimmer, but not thatgood.”As they trudged though the muddy streets on their way to find some food beforethey went to the offices to get on the list for work, Richard asked, “What’swrong?”Nicci shook her head in disgust. “Ordinary people don’t have your luck, Richard.Ordinary people suffer and struggle while your luck gets you into a job.”“If it was luck,” Richard asked, “then how come my back hurts from lugging thatload of iron bars into the warehouse?”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 46When Richard had finished unloading the last wagon of iron, he leaned forwardand placed his hands on the pile, hanging his head as he panted. The muscles inhis arms and shoulders throbbed. It was always easier having two men to handlethe bars, one in the wagon, and one on the ground, but the man who was supposedto help with the load had quit several days back, saying he hadn’t been treatedproperly. Richard didn’t really miss him all that much; even when the man got upoff his backside, his assistance was more trouble than it was worth.The light coming in the high windows was fading, leaving the sky in the west adeep purple. Sweat ran down his neck, making trails through the black iron dust.He wished he could jump in a cool mountain lake. That thought, in and of itself,was refreshing. He let his mind go there as he caught his breath.Ishaq came down the aisle with the lantern. “You work too hard, Richard.”“I thought I was hired to work.”Ishaq peered at Richard for a moment, one eye catching the harsh yellow light ofthe lantern he was holding. “‘Take my advice. You work too hard, it’s only goingto get you into trouble.”Richard had been working at the warehouse for three weeks, unloading wagons andloading others. He’d come to know a number of the other men. He had a good ideaof what Ishaq meant.“But I’m still worried about trying to swim with an iron bar wrapped around myneck.”Ishaq gave up on his scowl and grunted a laugh. “I was just spouting for Jori’ssake, that day.”Jori was the driver who had refused to help unload the wagon when it broke down.Richard yawned. “I know, Ishaq.”“This isn’t no farm, like where you came from. This is different, living underthe ways of the Order. You got to take the needs of others in mind if you hopeto get along. It’s just the way the world is.”Richard caught the thread of caution in Ishaq’s voice, and the meaning of thegentle warning.“You’re right, Ishaq. Thanks. I’ll try to remember.”Ishaq gestured with his lantern toward the door. “Workers’ group meetingtonight. Best be on your way.”Richard groaned. “I don’t know. It’s late and I’m tired. I’d really rather-”“You don’t want your name to start going around. You don’t want people to starttalking that you’re not civic-minded.”Richard smirked. “I thought the meetings were voluntary.”Ishaq barked a laugh again. Richard collected his pack from a shelf in the backcorner and then ran to the door so Ishaq could lock it.Outside, in the gathering darkness, Richard could just make out Nicci’scurvaceous form sitting on the wall at the warehouse entrance. Her curves oftenput him in mind of nothing so much as a snake. They had no room, yet, so sheoften came by the warehouse after she’d spent much of the day waiting in linesto buy bread and other necessities. They would walk together back to theirshelter in a quiet alley about a mile away. Richard had paid a small price tosome of the boys there to guard their place and make sure no one else took it.The boys were young enough to be thankful for the small price and old enough tobe diligent about their job.“Get any bread?” Richard asked as he approached.Nicci hopped down off the wall. “No bread today-they were out. But I got us somecabbage. I’ll make us a soup.”Richard’s stomach was growling. He’d been hoping for bread so he could eat apiece right then. Soup would take time.“Where’s your pack? And if you bought cabbage, where is it?”She smiled and produced something small. She held it out before them as theywalked so as to silhouette it against the deep violet of dusk. It was a key.“A room? We got a place?”“I checked the lodging office this afternoon. Our name finally came up. Theyassigned a room to us. Mr. and Mrs. Cypher. We can sleep inside tonight. Goodthing, too; it looks like it will rain tonight. I already put my things in ourroom.”Richard rubbed his sore shoulders. He felt a wave of revulsion at the sham shewas putting him through . . . putting Kahlan through. There were times when hefelt a hint of something profoundly important about her and what she was doing,but most of the time he was merely overwhelmed by the lunacy of it all.“Where is this room?” He was hoping it wasn’t clear over on the other side ofthe city.“It’s one we were at before-not too far from here. The one with the stain on thewall just inside the door.”“Nicci, they all had stains on the walls.”“The stain that looked like a horse’s rear end with its tail flicked up. You’llsee it soon.”Richard was starving. “I have to go to a workers’ group meeting again tonight.”“Oh,” Nicci said. “Workers’ group meetings are important. They help keep aperson’s mind on what’s proper and on everyone’s duty to his fellow man.”The meetings were torture. Nothing worthwhile ever came about at the meetings.They sometimes lasted hours. There were people, though, who lived for themeetings so they could stand up in front of others and talk about the glory ofthe Order. It was their shining hour, their time to be somebody, to beimportant.Those who didn’t show up for the meetings were used as examples of people whoweren’t properly committed to the cause of the Order. If the absent persondidn’t mend his ways, it was possible he could end up being suspected ofsubversion. The lack of truth to the suspicion was irrelevant. Stating thecharge made some people feel more important in a land where equality was held asthe highest ideal.Subversion seemed to be a dark cloud hovering constantly over the Old World. Itwasn’t at all unusual to see the city guard taking people into custody onsuspicion of subversion. Torture produced confessions, which proved the veracityof the accuser. The people who spoke at length at the meetings had, by thislogic, accurately pointed a finger at a number of insurrectionists, as evidencedby their confessions.The undercurrent of tension in Altur’Rang left many worried over the constantscourge of insurrection-coming from the New World, it was said. Officials of theOrder wasted no time in stamping it out whenever it was discovered. Other peoplewere so consumed with fear that the finger would turn toward them that thespeakers at the workers’ group meetings were assured of having a large number ofzealous supporters.In many a public square, as a constant reminder of what would happen should youfall into the wrong company, the bodies of subversives were left to hang fromhigh poles until the birds picked their bones clean. The running joke, if anincautious person said anything that sounded at all out of line, was “Youlooking to be buried in the sky?”Richard yawned again as they turned down the street toward the meeting hall. “Idon’t remember the stain that looks like a horse’s rear end.”Rocks crunched beneath their boots as they walked down the side of the darkstreet. Off ahead of them, in the distance, he could see Ishaq’s lanternswinging as the man hurried to the meeting.“You were paying attention to something else at the time. It’s the room wherethose three live.”“Three what?”A number of other people, some he knew, most he didn’t, hastened along thestreet on their way to the meeting.Richard remembered then. He stopped.“You mean the place where those three bullies live-the three with the knives?”He could just barely see her nod in the dim light. “That’s the place.”“Great.” Richard wiped a hand across his face as they started out again. “Didyou ask if we could have a different room?”“New people in the city are fortunate to get rooms. Rooms are assigned as yourname comes up. If you turn it down, you go back to the bottom of the list.”“Did you have to give the landlord any money, yet?”She shrugged. “Just what I had.”Richard ground his teeth as he walked. “That’s all we have for the rest of theweek.”“I can stretch the soup.”Richard didn’t trust her. She probably somehow saw to it that they got thatparticular room. He suspected that she wanted to see what he would do about thethree young men, now that he was forced into the situation. She was always doinglittle things, asking odd questions, making bold statements, just to see whathis reaction would be, how he would handle matters. He couldn’t imagine what itwas she wanted from him.He began to worry about the three. He remembered quite clearly how Cara’s Agielhad caused Kahlan to suffer the same pain as Nicci. If those three abused Nicci,Kahlan would suffer it, too. That thought made him go cold and sweaty withworry.At the workers’ group meeting, Richard and Nicci sat on benches at the rear of asmoky room while people up front spoke about the glory of the Order, and how ithelped all people to live a moral life. Richard’s mind drifted to the brookbehind the house he had built, to the sunlit summer afternoons watching Kahlandangle her feet in the water. He ached with longing as his mind’s eye traced thecurve of her legs. There were speeches about every worker’s duty to their fellowman. Many of the discourses were given in a droning monotone, having beenrepeated so often that it was clear that the words were meaningless, and thatonly the act of saying them mattered. Richard recalled Kahlan laughing as hecaught the fish he’d put in jars for her. Many of the people, the group leaders,or citizen spokesmen, delivered with passion and fire their praise for the waysof the Order. A few people stood up and talked about those who weren’t there,giving their names, saying what poor attitudes they had toward the welfare oftheir fellow workers. Whispers passed among the crowd.After the speeches were given, some of the workers’ wives stood up and explainedthat they had extra need of late because they had just had new children, ortheir husbands were laid up, or the relatives they cared for were ill. Aftereach spoke, there was a show of hands. If you agreed to do the right thing andhave the group help them, then you raised your hand.The names of these who didn’t raise their hand were noted. Ishaq had explainedto Richard that you were allowed not to raise your hand, if you didn’t agree,but if you did it very often, you were put on a watch list. Richard didn’t knowwhat a watch list was, but it was easy enough to surmise, and Ishaq had toldRichard that he didn’t want to be on one, and to see to it that he raised hishand more often than not.Richard raised it every time. He didn’t really care what happened. He had nointerest in taking part, no interest in trying to make things better, and nointerest in how well or poorly people’s lives went. Most seemed to want thecomfort of the Order running their lives, relieving them of the burden ofthinking on their own. Just like Anderith. Nicci seemed surprised, andoccasionally even disappointed, to see his hand go up every time, but didn’tobject or question.He was hardly even aware of his hand going up. He was smiling inwardly as herecalled the wonder in Kahlan’s expression, the astonishment in her green eyes,when she saw Spirit for the first time. Richard would have carved a mountain forher, just to see her tearful joy in seeing something she admired, something shecherished, something she valued.Another man spoke, complaining about the conditions, how unfair they were, andhow he had been forced to quit rather than subject himself to such abuse by thetransport company. He was the man who had quit and left Richard to handle theloads by himself. Richard raised his hand along with all the others to grant theman full wages for six months in recompense.After the show of hands, and some whispering and scratching on paper as all theobligations were figured up, the healthy working members were assessed theirjust share to help those in need. Those who were able, Richard had been told,had a duty to produce with all their effort in order to help those who couldn’t.When men’s names were called, they stood to hear the share to be taken fromtheir wages the next week. Because he was new, Richard’s name was called last.He stood, staring off across the dimly lit room at the people in moth-eatencoats sitting behind the long table made of two old doors. Ishaq sat at one end,going along with the others in everything. Several of the women still had theirheads together. When they finished, they whispered to the chairman and henodded.“Richard Cypher, being as you are new, you still have some catching up to do onyour duty to your workers’ group. Your next weeks wages are assessed as due inaid..”Richard stood dumbly for a moment. “How am I to eat to pay my rent?”People in the room turned to frown at him. The chairman slapped his hand on thetable, calling for silence.“You should thank the Creator to be blessed with good health so as you can work,young man. Right now, there are those who are not as fortunate in life as you,those with greater need than you. Suffering and need comes before selfishpersonal enrichment.”Richard sighed. What did it really matter? After all, he was lucky in life.“Yes, sir. I see what you mean. I’m happy to volunteer my share toward thosewith needs.”He wished Nicci hadn’t given away all their money.“Well,” he said to Nicci as they shuffled out into the night, “I guess we canask the landlord for the rent money back. We can stay on where we were stayingbefore, until I can work some more and save up some money.”“They don’t give rent money back,” she said. “The landlord will understand ourneed and let our debt build until we can start paying on it. Next meeting, youjust have to go up before the review board and explain your hardship. If youpresent it properly, they will give you a hardship charity to pay your rent.”Richard was exhausted. He felt like he were having some kind of silly dream.“Charity? It’s my wages-for the work I do.”“That’s a selfish way of looking at it, Richard. The job is at the grace of theworkers’ group, the company, and the Order.”He was too tired to argue. Besides, he didn’t expect any justice in anythingdone in the name of the Order. He just wanted to go to their new room and getsome sleep.When they opened the door, one of the three youths was pawing through Nicci’spack. Holding some of her underthings in one hand, he aimed a smirk back overhis shoulder at them.“Well, well,” he said as he stood. He still wore no shirt. “Looks like the twodrowned rats have found a hole to live in.” His leering gaze slid to Nicci. Hewasn’t looking at her face.Nicci snatched the pack away first, then her things from his other hand. Shestuffed her personal clothes back in the pack while he watched, grinning thewhole time. Richard feared she might abandon the link to Kahlan in order to useher power, but she only glared at the youth.The room reeked of mold. The low ceiling made Richard feel uncomfortably hemmedin. The ceiling had once been whitewashed, but was now dark with soot fromcandles and lamps, making the room feel cavelike. A candle sitting on a rustedbracket by the door provided the only light. A wardrobe stood crookedly in thecorner in front of dirty walls spotted with flyblows. The wardrobe was missing adoor. Two wooden chairs at a table under one small window on the far wall werethe only place to sit, other than the warped and gouged pine floor. The smallsquares of window glass were opaque under a variety of different-colored layersof paint.Through a small triangle in the corner where the glass was broken out, Richardcould see the gray wall of the next building.“How did you get in here?” Nicci snapped.“Master key.” He waved it like a king’s pass. “See, my father’s the landlord. Iwas just checking your things for subversive writings.”“You can read?” Nicci sniped. “I would have to see that to believe it.”The defiant grin never left his face. “We’d not like to find we have subversivesliving under our roof. Could endanger everyone else. My father has a duty toreport any suspicious activity.”Richard stepped aside to let the young man by as he headed for the door, butthen caught his arm as the youth picked up the candle.“That’s our candle,” Richard said.“Yeah? What makes you think so?”Richard tightened his grip on the bare, lean, muscular arm. Looking him in theeye, he gestured with his other hand.“Our initials are scratched in the bottom, there.”Before he thought, the young man instinctively turned the candle to have a look.The hot wax spilled over his hand. He dropped the candle with a yelp.“Oh my, I am sorry,” Richard said. He stooped and picked up the candle. “You’reall right, I hope. You didn’t get any of that burning wax in your eyes, did you?Hot wax in your eyes hurts something fierce.”“Yeah?” He swiped his straight dark hair back from his eyes. “How would you knowthat?”“Back where I came from, I saw it happen to some poor fellow.”Richard leaned partway out into the hall, into the light of another candle on ashelf. With his thumbnail, he made a show of carving an R and a C in the bottomof the candle. “See, here? My initials.”The youth didn’t bother to look. “Uh-huh.”He swaggered out the door. Richard went with him and lit the candle from theflame of the one in the hall. Before walking away, the young man turned backwith a haughty look.“How did that fellow manage to be stupid enough to get hot wax in his eyes? Washe a big dumb ox like you?”“No,” Richard said offhandedly. “No, not at all. He was a cocky young man whofoolishly put his hands on another man’s wife. He got the hot wax dripped in hiseyes by the husband.”“Yeah? Well why didn’t the dumb jackass just shut his eyes?”Richard gave the lad a deadly smile for the first time.“Because his eyelids had been cut off, first, so he couldn’t close them. Yousee, where I come from, anyone touching a woman against her wishes isn’t treatedindulgently.”“Yeah?”“Yeah. The young man’s eyelids weren’t the only thing that got cut off.”The young man swiped his black hair back again. “You threatening me, ox?”“No. There would be nothing I could do to you that would harm you more than whatyou’re already doing to harm yourself.”“What’s that supposed to mean?”“You are never going to amount to anything. You will always be the worthlessmuck people scrape from their shoes. You only get one life and you are wastingyours. That’s a terrible shame. I doubt you will ever know what it is to betruly happy, to achieve anything of worth, to have genuine pride in yourself.You bring it all on yourself, and I could do no worse to you.”“I can’t help what life deals me.”“Yes, you can. You create your own life.”“Yeah? How do you figure?”Richard gestured around himself. “Look at the pigsty you live in. Your father isthe landlord. Why don’t you show some pride and fix up the place?”“He’s the landlord, not the owner. The man who owned it was a greedy bastard,charging more rent than many could afford. The Order took the place over. Forhis crimes against the people they tortured the owner to death. My father wasgiven the job of landlord. We just run the place to help out fools like you whodon’t have a place; we’ve no money to go around fixing up the building.”“Money?” Richard pointed. “It takes money to pick up that garbage left there inthe hall?”“I didn’t put it there.”“And these walls-it doesn’t take money to wash the walls. Look at the ceiling inthis room. It hasn’t been washed in a decade, at least.”“Hey, I’m no scrub woman.”“And the front stoop? Someone is going to break their neck on it. Could be you,or your father. Why don’t you do something worthwhile for a change and fix it?”“I told you, we’ve no money to fix things.”“It doesn’t take money. You just need to take it apart, clean the joints, andput in some new wedges. You can cut them from any little scrap of wood lyingaround.”The young man wiped his palms on his pants. “If you’re so smart, then why don’tyou fix the stairs?”“Good idea. I will.”“Yeah?” His sneer returned. “I don’t believe you.”“Tomorrow, after I get home from work, I will fix the stairs. If you show up,I’ll teach you how it’s done.”“I might show up just to see some dupe going to the work of fixing somethingthat isn’t even his, and for nothing besides.”“It isn’t for nothing. It’s because I use the front steps, too, and for thepleasure in the place where I live. I care if my wife falls and breaks her leg.But if you want to come and learn how to fix the steps, you will wear a shirtout of respect for the women in your building.”“And if I show up and watch you, and I don’t wear a stupid shirt like some oldgeezer?”“Then I wouldn’t have enough respect for you to bother teaching you how to fixthe stairs. You will learn nothing, then.”“What if I don’t want to learn something?”“Then you will have taught me something, about you, instead.”He rolled his dark eyes. “Why should I care about learning to fix some dumbstairs?”“You shouldn’t necessarily care about fixing some stairs, but if you care aboutyourself, you should care about learning-even learning simple things. You cometo have pride in yourself only by accomplishing things, even from fixing someold stairs.”“Yeah? I got pride in myself.”“You intimidate people and then mistake that for respect. Others can’t grant youself-respect, even others who care about you. You have to earn self-respectyourself. All you know right now is how to stand around and look stupid.”He folded his arms. “Who you calling-”Richard jabbed a finger against the young man’s smooth chest, forcing him back apace. “You only get one life. Is that all you want out of it standing aroundcalling names, scaring people with your gang? Is that all you want your one lifeto mean to you?“Anyone who wants more out of life, who wants their life to mean something,would care about learning things. Tomorrow I’m going to fix those stairs.Tomorrow we’ll see what sort you are.”The youth folded his arms again in a defiant stance. “Yeah? Well, maybe I’drather spend time with my friends.”Richard shrugged. “That’s why your lot in life isn’t fate. I don’t have any sayin much of my life, but I make whatever choices I can make in my own rationalbest interest. It’s my choice to fix those stairs and make the place I live alittle better instead of whining and waiting and hoping for someone else to dosomething for me. I have pride that I know how to do that for myself.“Fixing stairs isn’t going to make you a man, but it’s going to make you alittle more confident in yourself. If you want, bring your friends, and I’llteach you all how to use those knives of yours for something more than justwaving in people’s faces.”“We might come to laugh at you working, Ox.”“Fine. But if you and your pals want to learn anything of worth, then you’dbetter start out by showing me you mean to learn by showing respect and showingup with shirts. That’s the first choice you have. If you make it wrong, thenyour choices as you go along are only going to become more limited. And my nameis Richard.”“Like I said, you might be good for a laugh.” He made a face. “Richard.”“Laugh all you want. I know my own worth and don’t need to prove it to someonewho doesn’t know theirs. If you want to learn, you know what you must do. If youever wave a knife at me again, thoughor, worse, my wife-then you will be makingthe last of your many mistakes in life.”He chose to ignore the threat with more bravado. “What am I ever going to be?Some dupe, like you, working your tail off for that greedy Ishaq and histransport company?”“What’s your name?”“Kamil.”“Well, Kamil, I work in exchange for wages so I can support myself and my wife.I have have something of value-myself. Someone values my worth enough to pay mefor my time and ability. Right now, choosing to work at loading wagons is one ofthe few choices I have to make in my life. I chose to fix the steps because itimproves my life.” Richard narrowed his eyes. “And what does Ishaq have to dowith it, anyway?”“Ishaq? He’s the one who owns the transport company.”“Ishaq is just the load master.”“Ishaq used to live here, back before the Order took over the building. Myfather knew him. Matter of fact, you’ll be sleeping in his parlor. Back then, itwas his transport company. He chose the path of enlightenment over greed,though, when it was offered him. He let the citizen workers’ group help him tolearn to be a better citizen of the Order, learn his place under the Creator.Now he knows he’s no better than any of the rest of us-even me.”Richard glanced at Nicci, who was standing in the middle of their room, watchingthe conversation. He’d forgotten all about her. He didn’t feel like talkinganymore.“I’ll see you tomorrow evening, whether you come to laugh or to learn. It’s yourlife, Kamil, and your choice.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 47The sun was just coming up. Dusty shafts of light angled into the warehousethrough the high windows. When he saw Ishaq coming down the aisle to give himthe list of iron to be loaded for various wagons, Richard hopped down off therack where he’d been waiting.Richard hadn’t seen the load master for a week. “Ishaq. Are you all right? Wherehave you been?”The burly load master hurried up the aisle. “Hello to you, too.”“I’m sorry-hello. I was worried. Where have you been?”He made a face. “Meetings. Always meetings. Wait in this office, wait in thatoffice. No work, just meetings for this and for that. I had to go see people totry to arrange for loads people need. Sometimes I think no one really wants anygoods to move in this city. It would be easier for them if everyone got paid,but had to do no work-then they would not have to sign their name on a piece ofpaper and worry if maybe someday they will be called to account for having doneit.”“Ishaq, is it true that this transport company used to be yours?”The man paused to catch his breath. “Who tells you these things?”“What about it? Did the transport company used to be yours?”Ishaq shrugged. “Still is, I guess.”“What happened?”“What happened? Nothing happened, except maybe I got smart and figured out itwas more work than I needed.”“What did they threaten you with?”Ishaq peered at Richard for a time. “Where are you from? You don’t seem like anyfarmboy I ever met.”Richard smiled. “You didn’t answer my question, Ishaq.”The man gestured irritably. “What for you want to know about past history? Pastis past. A man has to look at the way things are and do the best he can fromwhat life presents him. A choice was put to me, and I made it. Things are theyway they are. Wishing don’t put food before my children.”Richard’s inquisitive frown suddenly felt cruel on his face. He let it go. “Iunderstand, Ishaq. I really do. I’m sorry.”The man shrugged again. “Now I work here just like everyone else. Much easier. Imust follow the same rules, or I could lose my job, just like everyone else.Everyone is equal, now.”“Praise be to the Order.” Ishaq smiled at Richard’s gibe. Richard held out hishand. “Let’s have the list.”The load master handed over the paper. It only had the names of two places onit, with some directions for grade, length, and amounts.“What’s this?” Richard asked.“We need a loader to go with a wagon to pick up some iron and see it delivered.”“So, I’m working on the wagons, now? Why? I thought you needed me in thewarehouse.”Ishaq took off his red hat and scratched his head of dark, thinning hair. “Wehad some . . . complaints.”“About me? What did I do? You know I’ve worked hard.”“Too hard.” Ishaq readjusted his hat on his head. “Men in the warehouse say youare petty and spiteful. Their words, not mine. They say you make them feel badby flaunting how young and strong you are. They say you are laughing behindtheir backs.”Many of the men were younger than Richard, and strong enough.“Ishaq, I never-”“I know, I know. But they feel that you do. Don’t make trouble for yourself,now. Their feelings are what matter, not what is.”Richard let out a frustrated sigh. “But I was told by the workers’ group that Ihave the ability to work where as others don’t, and that I was supposed tocontribute my full effort in order to help relieve the strain on those lessable-those who don’t have my ability. They said that I would lose the job if Ididn’t do my full effort.”“It’s a fine line to walk.”“And I stepped over the line.”“They want you dismissed.”Richard sighed. “So, I’m through, here?”Ishaq waggled his hand. “Yes, and no. You are dismissed from the warehouse forhaving a bad attitude. I convinced the committee to give you another chance andlet you be moved to the wagons. The wagons aren’t as much work, because you canonly load it, and then when you get to where it’s going, you unload it. Can’tget in much trouble, that way.”Richard nodded. “Thanks, Ishaq.”Ishaq’s gaze sought refuge among the racks of iron and the bins of charcoal andlong rows of ore that needed delivery. He scratched his temple.“The pay is less.”Richard brushed the iron and ore dust from his hands and rear of his pants.“What’s the difference? They just take it from me anyway and give it out. I’mnot really losing any pay, other people are losing my pay.”Ishaq chuckled and clapped Richard on the shoulder. “You are the only one aroundhere I can count on, Richard. You are different than the others-I feel I cantalk to you and it won’t drift to other ears.”“I wouldn’t do that to you.”“I know. That’s why I tell you what I don’t tell the others. I am expected to beequal, and to work like anyone else, but I am also expected to provide jobs.They took my business, but they still expect me to run it for them. Crazyworld.”“You don’t know the half of it, Ishaq. So what about this wagon-loading job?What is it you need done?”“The blacksmith out at the site is dealing me a fit.”“Why?”“He has orders for tools, but he has no iron. Lots of people are waiting onthings.” He swept a hand out at the rack of iron. “Most of this is what wasordered last autumn. Last autumn! It’s nearly spring and it’s only now come in.It’s all been promised to those who ordered it before.”“So, why did it take so long for it to get here?”Ishaq slapped his forehead. “Maybe you are an ignorant farmboy, after all. Whereyou been? Under rocks? You can’t just get things because you want them. You gotto wait your turn. Your order must pass before the review board.”“Why?”“Why, why, why. Is that all you know?”Ishaq sighed and said something under his breath about the Creator testing hispatience. He slapped the back of his fingers to the palm of his other hand as heexplained it to Richard.“Because you’ve got to think of others, that’s why. You got to take otherpeople’s needs into consideration. You have to consider the good of everyone. IfI get all the runs picking up and delivering the iron, then what chance haveothers who want to do the same? If I have all the business, that’s unfair. Itwould put people out of work. What’s available has to be divided up. The boardof supervision must make sure everything is equal to all. Some people can’thandle the orders so fast as I can, or they have trouble, or they can’t getworkers, or their workers have troubles, so I got to wait until they can catchup.”“It’s your business, why can’t-”“Why, why, why. Here, take this order. I don’t need to have that blacksmith comeall the way down here again and yell at me. He’s in trouble with his orders andhe needs the iron.”“Why is he in trouble? I thought everyone had to wait their turn.”Ishaq lifted an eyebrow and lowered his voice. “His customer is the Retreat.”“The Retreat? What’s that?”“The Retreat.” Ishaq spread his arms, indicating something big. “That’s the nameof the place being built for the emperor.”Richard hadn’t known the name. The emperor’s new palace was the reason for allthe workers coming to Altur’Rang. He supposed it was the reason Nicci hadinsisted they come to the city, too. She had some interest in having him be partof the grand project. He assumed it was her grotesque sense of irony.“The new palace is going to be huge,” Ishaq said, waving his arms again. “A lotof work for a lot of people. It will be work for years building the Retreat.”“So, when the goods are for the Order, then you had better deliver, I take it.”Ishaq smiled and dipped a deep nod. “Now, you are starting to understand, Mr.Richard why, why, why. The blacksmith is working directly from the orders of thebuilders of the palace, who report to the highest people. The builders needtools and things made. They don’t want to hear excuses from a lowly blacksmith.The blacksmith doesn’t want to hear excuses from me, but I have to go by whatthe review board says-he doesn’t, he goes by what the palace says. I’m in themiddle.”Ishaq paused when one of the other loaders came down the aisle with a piece ofpaper. Ishaq read the paper the man gave him, while the man gave a sidelong lookat Richard. Ishaq sighed and gave brief directions to the man. After he wasgone, Ishaq turned back to Richard.“I can only transport what the review board allows me to move. That paper, justnow-it was instructions from the board for me to hold a shipment of timbers tothe mines because the load was going to go to a company that needs the work. Yousee? I can’t put other people out of business by being unfair and deliveringmore than they do, or else I have trouble, and I get replaced by someone whowill not be so unfair to his competitors. Ah, it’s not like the old days, when Iwas young and foolish.”Richard folded his arms. “You mean to say that if you do a good job, you get introuble-just like I did.”“Good job. Who’s to say what is a good job. Everybody’s got to work together forthe good of everybody. That is a good job-if you help your fellow man.”Richard watched a couple of men off in the distance loading a wagon withcharcoal. “You don’t really believe that mouthful of mush, do you, Ishaq?”Ishaq sighed in a long suffering manner. “Richard, please, load the wagon whenyou get to the foundry and then go with the wagon out to the Retreat and unloadit at the blacksmith’s shop. Please. Don’t get sick on me, or get a bad back, orhave infirm children in the middle of the run? I don’t need to see theblacksmith again, or I will have to go swimming with an iron bar around myneck.”Richard grunted a laugh. “My back is feeling fine.”“Good. I’ll get a driver over here to drive the wagon.” Ishaq waggled acautionary finger. “And don’t ask the driver to help load or unload. We don’tneed that kind of grievance brought up at the next meeting. I had to beg Jorinot to lodge a complaint after I asked him to help me unload the wagon that dayin the rain, when the wheels broke-the day you helped me get the load to thewarehouse. Remember?”“I remember.”“Please, don’t give Jori any trouble. Don’t touch the reins-that’s his job. Be agood fellow, then? Get the iron loaded and unloaded so that blacksmith doesn’tcome to see me again?”“Sure, Ishaq. I won’t make any trouble for you. You can trust me.”“There’s a good fellow.” Ishaq started away, but turned back. “Was not so muchtrouble on a farm-am I right?”“No, it wasn’t. I wish I was back there, now.”Before he got far, Ishaq turned back once more. “You be sure to bow and scrapeif you see any of those priests. You hear?”“Priests? What priests? How will I know them?”“Brown robes and creased caps-oh, you’ll know them. You can’t miss them. If yousee any, you be on your best manners. If a priest suspects you of having animproper attitude toward the Creator or such, he can have you tortured. Thepriests are Brother Narev’s disciples.”“Brother Narev?”“The high priest of the Fellowship of Order-” Ishaq waved his arms impatiently.“I have to get Jori to come with the wagon. Please, Richard, do as I ask. Thatblacksmith will feed me to his forge if I don’t have that iron out there today.Please, Richard, get that load out there. Please?”Richard gave Ishaq a smile in order to put his mind at ease.“You have my word, Ishaq. The blacksmith will have the iron.”Ishaq heaved a sigh and hurried off to find his driver."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 48It was late in the muggy afternoon by the time they made it to the site of theRetreat. Sitting in the wagon beside Jori as they cleared the top of the finalhill, Richard was awestruck by the sight. It was beyond huge. He couldn’timagine how many square miles had been cleared. Gangs of thousands of men,looking like ants spread out below, worked in lines with shovels and basketsreshaping the contour of the land.Jori was disinterested in the construction, and only spat over the side,offering the occasional “I suppose” to some of Richard’s questions.The foundation was still being laid in deep trenches, enabling Richard, lookingdown from the road, to see on the ground the outline of the future structure. Itwas hard to fathom how enormous the building was going to be. Seeing the specksmoving slowly beside it, it was hard to keep in mind that they were men.For sheer size, the structure would rival anything Richard had ever seen. Therewere miles of grounds and gardens going in. Fountains and other toweringstructures along entrance roads were beginning to be erected. Sweeping stretchesof mazes were being constructed with hedges. Hillsides were dotted with treesthat had been planted according to a grand plan.The Retreat faced a lake in what was to be that majestic park. The short side ofthe main building was to run a quarter mile along the river. Stone pilingsmarched partway out into the river, with a series of connecting arches juststarting to be constructed. Apparently, part of the palace was to extend outover the water, with docks for the emperor’s pleasure craft.Across the river lay more of the city. On the palace side of the river, too, thecity spread all around, though at a great distance from the Retreat. Richardcouldn’t imagine how many buildings and people had been displaced for theconstruction. This was to be no distant and remote emperor’s palace, but ratherit was set right in the center of Altur’Rang. Roads were being paved withmillions of cobbles, giving the multitudes of citizens of the Order access tocome and see the wand structure. There were already crowds of people standingbehind rope barricades, watching the construction.Despite the poverty of the Old World, it would appear that this grand palace wasto be a crown jewel of unsurpassed splendor.Stone of various kinds lay in great piles. In the distance, Richard could seemen working at cutting it into the required shapes. The heavy afternoon air rangwith the faraway knells of hundreds of hammers and chisels. There werestockpiles of granite and marble in a variety of colors, and massive quantitiesof limestone blocks. Special quarry wagons waited in serpentine columns todeliver yet more. The long blocks of stone, called lifts, were slung under heavybeams that bridged the front and rear axles. Huts and great open shelters hadbeen built for the stone workers so they could work no matter the weather.Timber was stickered in row upon row of huge stacks covered with purpose-builtroofs. The overflow was covered in canvas. Small mountains of materials formortar were scattered around the foundation, looking like anthills, the illusionaided by all the dark specks of men moving about.Away from the site itself, on a road that snaked its way along the side of ahill, among a small city of new work buildings overlooking the site, lay theblacksmith’s shop. It was quite large, compared with such places Richard hadseen before. Of course, Richard had never seen anything on this scale beingbuilt. He had seen grand places that already existed. To see one just beginningwas a revelation. The sheer scale of everything was disorienting.Jori expertly backed his team, putting the rear of the wagon right at doubledoors standing open into blackness.“There you be,” Jori said. It was a long speech for the lanky driver. He pulledout a loaf of bread and a waterskin filled with ale and climbed down from thewagon to find a place farther down the hill, where he could sit and watch thebuilding while Richard worked at unloading the iron.The blacksmith’s shop was dark and stifling hot, even in the outer, cluttered,stockroom. Like all blacksmith’s shops, the walls in the workroom were coveredin soot. Windows were kept to a minimum, mostly located overhead and coveredwith shutters, so as to keep it dark in order to more easily judge the nature ofthe glowing metal.Despite being recently built for the work at the palace, the blacksmith’s shopalready looked a hundred years old. Nearly every spot held some tool or other ina dizzying array and variety. There were rows of tools, piles of them. Therafters were hung with tongs and fire pots and crucibles and squares anddividers and contraptions like huge insects which looked to be used for clampingpieces together. Low benches seemingly cobbled together in haste were hung allround with long-handled dies of every sort. Some benches held smallergrindstones. Slots around some tables held hundreds of files and rasps. Some ofthe low tables were covered in a jumble of hammers in such variety as Richardhad never imagined, their handles all sticking out, making the tabletops looklike huge pincushions.The floor was choked with clutter: boxes overflowing with parts, bars, rivets;wedges; lengths of iron stock; clippings; pry bars; pole hooks; dented pots;wooden jigs; tin snips; lengths of chain; pulleys; and a variety of specialanvil attachments. Everything was covered with soot or dust or metal filings.Broad short barrels full of liquids sat around the anvils where men hammered onglowing iron held in tongs, flattening, stretching, cutting, squaring, clipping.Glowing metal hissed and smoked in protest as it was quenched in the liquid.Other men used the horns of their anvils to bend metal that looked like bits ofsunset held captive in tongs. They held up those fascinating bits and matchedthem to patterns, hammered on the metal some more, and checked it again.Richard could hardly think in all the noise.In the darkness, a man worked a big bellows, putting all his weight on thedownstroke. The blast of air made the fire roar. Charcoal overflowed frombaskets sitting wherever there had been room to put them. Cubbyholes held pipeand odd scraps of metal. Metal hoops leaned against benches and planks. Some ofthe hoops were for barrels, bigger ones were for wagon wheels. Tongs and hammerslay here and there on the floor where men had dropped them in the haste ofbattle with the hot iron. The whole place was as agreeable a clutter as he hadever seen.A man in a leather apron stood not far away at a door to another workroom. Heheld out a chalkboard covered with a maze of lines as he studied a largecontraption of metal bars on the floor in the room beyond. Richard waited, notwanting to interrupt the man’s concentration. The sharply defined muscles of hissooty arms glistened with sweat. The man tapped the chalk against his lip as hepuzzled, then swiped a line clean on the board and drew it again, moving itsconnecting points.Richard frowned at the drawing. It looked familiar, somehow, even though it wasno recognizable object.“Would you be the master blacksmith?” Richard asked when the man paused andlooked over his shoulder.The man’s brow seemed enduringly fixed in an intimidating scowl. His hair wascropped close to his skull-a good practice around so much fire and white-hotmetaladding to his menacing demeanor. He was of average height and sinewy, butit was his countenance that made him look big enough for any trouble that mightcome along. By the way the other men moved, and glanced at this man, they fearedhim.Taken by inexplicable compulsion, Richard pointed at the line the man had justdrawn. “That’s wrong. What you just did is wrong. You have the top end right,but the bottom should go here, not where you put it.”He didn’t so much as blink. “Do you even know what this is?”“Well, not exactly, but I-”“Then how can you presume to tell me where to put this support?”The man looked like he wanted to stuff Richard in the forge and melt him down.“Offhand, I don’t know, exactly. Something just tells me that-”“You had better be the man with the iron.”“I am,” Richard said, glad to change the subject and wishing he had kept hismouth shut in the first place. He had only been trying to help. “Where would-”“Where have you been all day? I was told it would be here first thing thismorning. What did you do? Sleep till noon?”“Ah, no, sir. We went right to the foundry first thing. Ishaq sent me rightthere at dawn. But the man at the foundry was having problems because-”“I’m not interested. You said you had the iron. It’s already late enough. Get itunloaded.”Richard looked around. Every spot seemed occupied.“Where would you like it?”The master blacksmith glared around at the crammed room as if he expected someof the piles to get up and move for him. They didn’t.“If you’d have been here when you were supposed to be here, you could have putit out there, just inside the door in the outer supply room. Now they broughtthat big rock sled that needs welding, so you will have to put the iron in theback. Next time, get out of bed earlier.”Richard was trying to be polite, but he was losing his patience with beingcastigated because the blacksmith was having a troubled day.“Ishaq made it quite clear that you were to get iron today, and he sent me tosee to it. I have your iron. I don’t see anyone else able to deliver on suchshort notice.”The hand with the chalkboard lowered. The full attention of the man’s glowerfocused on Richard for the first time. Men who had heard Richard’s wordsscurried off to attend to important work farther away.“How much iron did you bring?”“Fifty bars, eight feet.”The man let out an angry breath. “I ordered a hundred. I don’t know why theysent an idiot with a wagon when-”“Do you want to hear the way it is, or do you want to yell at someone? If youjust want to spout off to no point and no useful end, then go right ahead as I’mnot much injured by ranting, but when you finally want to hear the truth of theway things are, just let me know and I’ll give it.”The blacksmith peered silently for a moment, a bull bewildered by a bumblebee.“What’s your name?”“Richard Cypher.”“So, what’s the truth of the way things are, Richard Cypher?”“The foundry wanted to fill the order. They have bar stock stacked to therafters. They can’t get it delivered. They wanted to let me have the wholeorder, but a transport inspector stationed there wouldn’t let us have the wholehundred bars because the other transport companies are supposed to get theirequal loads, but their wagons are broken down.”“So Ishaq’s wagons aren’t allowed to take more than their fair share, and fiftywas their allotment.”“That’s right,” Richard said. “At least until the other companies can move somemore goods.”The blacksmith nodded. “The foundry is dying to sell me all the iron I can use,but I can’t get it here. I’m not allowed to transport it-to put transportworkers, like you, out of work.”“Were it up to me,” Richard said. “I’d go back for another load today, but theytold me they couldn’t give me any more until next week at the earliest. I’dsuggest you get every transport company you can find to deliver you a wagonload.That way, you’ll have a better chance to get what you need.”The blacksmith smiled for the first time. It was amusement at the foolishness ofRichard’s idea. “Don’t you suppose I already thought of that? I’ve got orders inwith them all. Ishaq is the only one with equipment at the moment. The rest areall having wagon problems, horse problems, or worker problems.”“At least I have fifty bars for you.”“That will only keep me going the rest of the day and for the morning.” Theblacksmith turned. “This way. I’ll show you where you can stack it.”He led Richard through the congested workshop, among the confusion of work andmaterial. They went through a door and down a short connecting hall. The noisefell away behind. They entered a quiet building in back, attached, but set offon its own. The blacksmith unhooked a line attached at a cleat and let down atrapdoor covering a window in the roof.Light cascaded down into the center of the large room, where stood a huge blockof marble. Richard stood staring at the stunning stone heart of a mountain.It seemed completely out of place in a blacksmith’s workshop. There were talldoors at the far end, where the monolith had been brought in on skids. The restof the room had space left open all around the towering stone. Chisels of everysort and various-size mallets stuck up from slots along the pitch black walls.“You can put the bars here, on the side. Be careful when you bring them in.”Richard blinked. He had almost forgotten the man was there with him. Still hestared at the lustrous quality of the stone before him. “I’ll be careful,” hesaid without looking at the blacksmith. “I won’t bang it into the stone.”As the man started to leave, Richard asked, “I told you my name. What’s yours?”“Cascella.”“Is there more to it?”“Yes. Mister. See that you use it all.”Richard smiled as he followed the man out. “Yes, sir, Mr. Cascella. Ah, mind ifI ask what this is?”The blacksmith slowed to a stop and turned back. He gazed at the marble standingin the light as if it were a woman he loved.“This is none of your business, that’s what it is.”Richard nodded. “I only asked because it’s a beautiful piece of stone. I’venever seen marble before it was a statue or made into something.”Mr. Cascella watched Richard watching the stone. “There’s marble all over thissite. Thousands of tons of it. This is just one small piece. Now, get my shortedorder of iron unloaded.”By the time Richard was done, he was soaked in sweat, and filthy, not only fromthe iron bars, but from the soot of the blacksmith’s shop. He asked if he coulduse some of the water in a rain barrel that the men were using to wash in asthey were getting ready to leave for the day. They told him to go ahead.When he finished, Richard found Mr. Cascella back at the chalkboard, alone inthe suddenly silent shop, making corrections to the drawing and writing numbersdown the side.“Mr. Cascella, I’m finished. I kept the bars well off to the side, away from themarble.”“Thank you,” he mumbled.“Mind if I ask what you will have to pay for that fifty bars of iron?”The glare was back. “What’s it to you?”“From what I heard at the foundry, the man there had been hoping to fill thewhole order so he could get three point five gold marks, so, since you got halfyour order, I believe you will be paying one point seven five gold marks for thefifty bars of iron. Am I correct?”The glare darkened. “Like I said, what’s it to you?”Richard put his hands in his back pockets. “Well, I was wondering if you wouldbe willing to buy another fifty bars for one point five gold marks.”“So, you’re a thief, too.”“No, Mr. Cascella, I’m not a thief.”“Then how are you going to sell me iron for a quarter mark less than the foundryis selling it for? You smelting a little iron ore in your room at night, Mr.Richard Cypher?”“Do you want to hear what I have to say, or not?”His mouth twisted in annoyance. “‘balk.”“The foundry man was furious because he wasn’t allowed to transport your wholeorder. He has more iron than he can sell because he isn’t allowed to transportit, and the transport companies are all jammed up so they aren’t showing up. Hesaid he would be willing to sell it to me for less.”Why?”“He needs the money. He showed me his cold blast furnaces. He owes wages andneeds charcoal and ore and quicksilver, among other things, but hasn’t enoughmoney to buy it all. The only thing he has plenty of is smelted metal. Hisbusiness is strangling because he can’t move his product. I asked what price hewould be willing to sell me iron for, if he didn’t have to transport it-if Ipicked it up myself. He told me that if I came after dark, he would sell mefifty bars for one point two five gold marks. If you’re willing to buy it fromme for one point five, I’ll have you another fifty bars by morning, when yousaid you need it.”The man gaped as if Richard was a bar of iron that had just come to life beforehis eyes and started talking.“You know I’m willing to pay one and three-quarters, why would you offer to sellit to me for one and a half?”“Because,” Richard explained, “I want to sell it for less than you’d have to paythrough a transport company so that you’ll buy it from me, instead, and, becauseI need you to loan me the one and a quarter gold marks, first, so I can buy thebars in the first place and bring them to you. The foundry will only sell themto me if I pay when I come to take them.”“What’s to keep you from disappearing with my one and a quarter gold marks?”“My word.”The man barked a laugh. “Your word? I don’t know you.”“I told you, my name is Richard Cypher. Ishaq is scared to death of you, and hetrusted me to get you the iron so you won’t come wring his neck.”Mr. Cascella smiled again. “I’d not wring Ishaq’s neck. I like the fellow. He’sstuck in a tight spot. -But don’t you tell him I said that. I’d like to keep himon his toes.”Richard shrugged. “If you don’t want me to, I won’t tell him you know how tosmile. I know, though, that you’re in a tighter spot than Ishaq. You have todeliver goods for the Order, but you’re at the mercy of their methods.”He smiled again. “So, Richard Cypher, what time will you be here with yourwagon?”“I don’t have a wagon. But, if you agree, I’ll have your fifty iron bars rightthere”-Richard pointed at a spot out the double doors beside where Jori hadparked the wagon-”in a pile, by dawn.”Mr. Cascella frowned. “If you don’t have a wagon, how you going to get the barshere? Walk?”“That’s right.”“Are you out of your mind?”“I don’t have a wagon, and I want to earn the money. It’s not all that far. Ifigure I can carry five at a time. That only makes ten trips. I can do that bydawn. I’m used to walking.”“Tell me the rest of it-why you want to do this. The truth, now.”“My wife isn’t getting enough to eat. The workers’ group assesses most of mywages, since I’m able to produce, and gives it to those who don’t work. BecauseI can work, I’ve become a slave to those who can’t, or who don’t wish to. Theirmethods encourage people to find an excuse to let others take care of them. Iintensely dislike being a slave. I figure I can entice you to go along with thedeal by offering you a better price. We each gain a benefit. Value for value.”“If I were to go along, what do you plan to do with all that money-go live offit for a while? Drink it away?”“I need the money to buy a wagon and a team of horses.”The frown knotted tighter. “What do you need with a wagon?”“I need the wagon to deliver you all the iron you’re going to buy from mebecause I can get it for you cheaper, and because I can deliver it when you needit.”“You looking to get buried in the sky?”Richard smiled. “No. I just happen to think that the emperor wants his palacebuilt. From what I’ve heard, they have a lot of slave labor down there-peoplethey’ve captured. But they don’t have enough slave labor to do it all for them.They need people like you, and the foundries.“If the officials of the Order want to have the work progress-and not have toexplain to Emperor Jagang why it isn’t they will be inclined to look the otherway. In that narrow crack of need, there is opportunity. I expect I’ll have tobribe a few officials to get them to be busy elsewhere when I come to pick uploads, but I’ve already figured that cost into it. I’ll be acting on behalf ofmyself, not an established transport company, so they will be more inclined tosee this as a way of accomplishing what they need without suspending theirmorass of restrictions.“You will be getting iron for less than you pay now, and I can deliver. Youcan’t even get what you need at the higher price. You will make more, too. Weboth benefit.”The blacksmith stared for a moment as he tried to find a flaw in Richard’s plan.“You’re either the stupidest crook I ever saw, or the . . . I don’t even knowwhat. But I have Brother Narev breathing down my neck, and that isn’t pleasant.Not pleasant at all. I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but you know how Ishaqsweats over me? I sweat ten times that much when Brother Narev comes to ask whythe tools aren’t ready. The brothers don’t want to hear my troubles, they justwant what they want.”“I understand, Mr. Cascella.”He let out a sigh. “All right, Richard Cypher, one and a half gold marks forfifty bars delivered by dawn tomorrow-but I’ll only give you the one and aquarter now. You get the other quarter mark in the morning, when my iron ishere.”“Agreed. Who is this Brother Narev, anyway?”“Brother Narev? He’s the high priest-”“Did I hear someone mention my name?” The voice was deep enough to nearly rattlethe tools off the walls.Richard and the blacksmith turned to see a man approaching from around thecorner of the shop. Here and there, his heavy robes betrayed his large bonyframe. His face seemed to pull the gathering darkness into the deep creases ofhis face. Dark eyes gleamed out from under a hooded brow overspread with atangle of graying hairs. Wiry hair above his ears curled up from under the edgesof a dark, creased cap. The cap sat halfway down his forehead. He looked like ashadow come to life to stalk the world.Mr. Cascella bowed. Richard followed his lead.“We were just discussing the problem of getting enough iron, Brother Narev.”“Where are all my new chisels, blacksmith?”“I have yet to-”“I have stone sitting down there with no chisels to cut it. I have stonecutterswho need more tools. You are holding up my palace.”The blacksmith lifted a hand toward Richard. “This is Richard Cypher, BrotherNarev. He was just telling me how he thought he might be able get me the iron Ineed and-”The high priest held up his hand for silence.“You can get the blacksmith what he needs?” Brother Narev snapped at Richard.“It can be done.”“Then do it.”Richard bowed his head. “By your command, Brother Narev.”The shadowed figure turned to the shop. “Show me, blacksmith.”The blacksmith seemed to know what the high priest wanted and followed behindhim, gesturing for Richard to come along. Richard understood; he couldn’t getthe money to buy the iron until the blacksmith first took care of the importantman who had just vanished into the shadows of the shop.When the blacksmith snapped his fingers and pointed at a lamp on his way by,Richard snatched it up. He lit a long splinter in the glowing coals of the forgeand then lit the lamp. He held it up behind the two men as they stood justinside the doorway to the room with the complex contraption of metal barssitting on the floor beyond.Mr. Cascella held the chalkboard up in the light. Brother Narev looked at thedrawing on the chalkboard, then to the maze of iron lines on the floor,comparing them.Richard felt an icy tingle at the base of his scalp when he suddenly realizedwhat the thing on the floor was.Brother Narev pointed to the drawing, to the line Richard had said was wrong.“This line is wrong,” Brother Narev growled.The blacksmith wagged his finger over the chalk drawing. “But I have tostabilize this mass over here.”“I told you to add braces, I didn’t invite you to ruin the main scheme. You canleave the top of the support where you have it, but the bottom should beattached . . . here.”Brother Narev pointed to where Richard had said it should go.Mr. Cascella scratched his head of short hair as he stole a glance over hisshoulder just long enough to scowl at Richard.“That would work,” the blacksmith conceded. “It won’t be as easy, but it willwork.”“I’m not concerned with how easy it is,” Brother Narev said with menace. “Idon’t want anything attached to this area, here.”“No, sir.”“It must be seamless, so none of the joining work shows through when it iscovered in gold. Get me those tools made, first.”“Yes, Brother Narev.”The high priest turned an uncomfortable scrutiny on Richard. “There’s somethingabout you .... Do I know you?”“No, Brother Narev. I’ve never before met you. I would remember. Meeting a greatman such as yourself, I mean. I would remember such a thing.”He glared askance at Richard. “Yes, I suppose you would. You get the blacksmithhis iron.”“I said I would.”The Brother grunted irritably. “So you did.”As the tall shadow of a man stared into Richard’s eyes, Richard absently reachedto lift his sword a little to make sure it was clear in its scabbard. The swordwasn’t there.Brother Narev opened his mouth to say something, but his attention was caught bytwo young men entering the shop. They wore robes like the high priest, butwithout caps. They had simple hoods pulled up over their heads, instead.“Brother Narev,” one called.“What is it, Neal?”“The book you sent for has arrived. You asked that we come for you at once.”Brother Narev nodded to the young disciple, then directed a sour look at Mr.Cascella and Richard.“Get it done,” he said to both.Both Richard and the blacksmith bowed their heads as the high priest swept outof the shop.It felt as if a thundercloud had just departed over the horizon.“Come on,” Mr. Cascella said. “I’ll get you the gold.”Richard followed him into a little room where the master blacksmith pulled out astrongbox attached with massive chain to a huge pin in the floor under the plankserving as his desk. He unlocked the strongbox and handed Richard a gold mark.“Victor.”Richard looked up from the gold mark and frowned. “What?”“Victor. You asked what more there was to my name.” He set silver to make up thequarter mark on top of the gold mark resting in Richard’s palm. “Victor.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 49After leaving Ishaq’s place and before going to get the iron for Victor, Richardrushed back to his room. It wasn’t dinner he wanted, but to let Nicci know thathe had to go back to work. She had in the past made it clear that they werehusband and wife, and that she would take a dim view of him vanishing. He was toremain in Altur’Rang and work, just like any other normal man.Kamil and one of his friends were waiting for him. Both were wearing shirts.Richard stood at the foot of the stairs, looking up at the two. “I’m sorry,Kamil, but I have to go back to work-”“Then you’re a bigger dupe than I thought-taking work at night, too. You shouldjust stop trying. It’s no use trying in life. You just have to take what lifegives you. I knew you would have an excuse not to do what you said you would do.You almost had me thinking that you might be different than-”“I was going to say that I have to go back to work, so we have to do this rightaway.”Kamil twisted his mouth, as was his habit to express his displeasure with thoseolder and stupider than he.“This is Nabbi. He wants to watch your foolish labor, too.”Richard nodded, not showing any irritation at Kamil’s arrogant attitude. “Gladto meet you, Nabbi.” The third young man glared from the shadows back by thestairs in the hall. He was the biggest. He wasn’t wearing a shirt.To pry the steps apart, Richard used his knife and a rusty metal bar Kamil foundfor him. It wasn’t difficult-they were ready to fall apart on their own. As thetwo youths watched, Richard cleaned the grooves in the stringers. Since theywere chewed up from being loose, he deepened their bottoms, showing the two whathe was doing and explaining how he would bevel the ends of the treads to lockinto the deepened channel. Richard watched Kamil and Nabbi as they whittledwedges to match the one he made as a pattern for them. They were only toodelighted to show him their knife work; Richard was delighted that it helped getthe job done sooner.Once they had them back together, Kamil and Nabbi both ran up and down therepaired steps, apparently surprised that they really were now sturdy underfoot,and pleased that they were partly responsible for the repair.“You both did a good job,” Richard told them, because they had. They didn’t makeany smart remarks. They actually smiled.Richard’s dinner was watery millet eaten by the light of a burning wick floatingin linseed oil. The smell from the simple light went poorly with dinner, whichwas more water than millet. Nicci said she’d already eaten, and didn’t want anymore. She encouraged him to finish it.He didn’t give Nicci the details of his second job. She was insistent only thathe work; the work itself was irrelevant to her. She tended to her householdchores and expected him to earn them a living.She seemed satisfied that he was learning how ordinary people had to workthemselves sick just to make enough to get along in life. The promise of moneyto buy them more food seemed to spark a longing in her eyes that her lips didnot express. He noticed that the black material covering her once full bosom wasnow slack and half empty. Her elbows and hands had become bony.As he took another spoonful of millet, Nicci casually mentioned that thelandlord, Kamil’s father, had come by.Richard looked up from his soup. “What did he say?”“He said that since you have a job, the area citizens’ building committee hadassessed us extra rent in order to help pay the rent of those in the localbuildings who can’t work. You see, Richard, how life under the ways of the Ordercultivates caring in people, so that we all work together for the benefit ofall?”Nearly all of what was not taken by the workers’ group was taken by the areabuilding committee, or some other committee, and all for the same purpose: forthe betterment of the people of the Order. Richard and Nicci had next to nothingleft for food. Richard’s clothes were getting looser all the time, but not asloose as Nicci’s dresses were getting.She seemed smug about the fact that their rent was past due. Foodstuffs, atleast, were relatively inexpensive-when they were available. People said that itwas only by the grace of the Creator and the wisdom of the Order that they couldafford any food at all. Richard had heard talk at Ishaq’s place that moreplentiful and varied food could be had, for a price. Richard didn’t have theprice.On his wagon ride with Jori to the foundry and the blacksmith, Richard hadspotted distant houses that looked to be quite grand. Well-dressed people walkedthose streets. Occasionally, he saw them in carriages. They were people whoneither dirtied their hands or soiled their morals with business. They were menof principle. They were officials of the Order who saw to it that those with theability sacrificed for the cause of the Order.“Self-sacrifice is the moral duty of all people,” she said in challenge to hisclenched teeth.Richard could not hold his tongue. “Self-sacrifice is the obscene and senselesssuicide of slaves.”Nicci gaped at him. It was as if he had just said that a mother’s milk waspoison to her newborn.“Richard, I do believe that that’s the cruelest thing I’ve ever heard you say.”“It’s cruel to say that I would not happily sacrifice myself for that thug,Gadi? Or for some other thug I don’t know? It’s cruel not to willingly sacrificewhat’s mine to any greedy wretch who lusts to possess plundered goods, theunearned, even at the cost of their victim’s blood?“Self-sacrifice for a value held dear, for a life held dear, for freedom and thefreedom of those you respect-self-sacrifice such as mine for Kahlan’s life-isthe only rationally valid sacrifice. To be selfless means you are a slave whomust surrender your most priceless possession-your life-to any smirking thiefwho demands it.“The suicide of self-sacrifice is but a requirement imposed by masters onslaves. Since there is a knife to my throat, it is not to my good that I amstripped of what I earn by my own hand and mind. It is only to the good of theone with the knife, and those who by weight of numbers but not reason dictatewhat is the good of all those cheering him on so they might lap up any drop ofblood their masters miss.“Life is precious. That’s why sacrifice for freedom is rational: it is for lifeitself and your ability to live it that you act, since life without freedom isthe slow, sure death of self-sacrifice to the `good’ of mankind-who is alwayssomeone else. Mankind is just a collection of individuals. Why should everyone’slife be more important, more precious, more valuable than yours? Mindlessmandatory self-sacrifice is insane.”She stared, not at him, but at the flame dancing on the pool of linseed oil.“You don’t really mean that, Richard. You’re just tired and angry that you haveto work at night, too, just to get by. You should realize that all those othersyou help are there to help society, including you, should you be the one indesperate need.”Richard didn’t bother to argue with her, and said only, “I feel sorry for you,Nicci. You don’t even know the value of your own life. Sacrifice could meannothing to you.”“That’s not true, Richard,” she whispered, “I sacrifice for you .... I savedwhat millet we had for you, that you might have strength.”“The strength to stand upright when I throw my life away? Why did you sacrificeyour dinner, Nicci?”“Because it was the right thing to do-it was for the good of others.”He nodded as he peered at her in the dim light. “You would endanger your life tostarvation for others-for any others.” He pointed a thumb back over hisshoulder. “How about that thug, Gadi? Would you starve to death so he might eat?It might mean something, Nicci, if it was a sacrifice for someone you value, butit isn’t; it’s a sacrifice to some mindless gray ideal of the Order.”When she didn’t answer, Richard pushed the rest of his dinner before her. “Idon’t want your meaningless sacrifice.”She stared at the bowl of millet for an eternity.Richard felt sorry for her, for what she couldn’t understand as she stared atthe bowl. He thought about what would happen to Kahlan if Nicci were to fallsick from not getting enough to eat.“Eat, Nicci,” he said softly.She finally picked up her spoon and did as he said.When she had finished, she looked up with those blue eyes that seemed so eagerfor the sight of something he could not make her see. She slid the empty bowl tothe center of the table.“Thank you, Richard, for the meal.”“Why thank me? I am a selfless slave, expected to sacrifice for any worthlessperson who presents their need to me.”He strode to the door. With his hand on the loose knob, he turned back. “I haveto go, or I will lose my work.”Her big blue eyes were brimming with tears as she nodded.Richard made the first trip from the foundry through the dark streets toVictor’s shop carrying five bars. From windows along the way, a few peopleblinked out at the man lugging a load past. They blinked without comprehensionat the meaning of what he was doing. He was working for nothing but his ownbenefit.Bent under the weight, Richard kept telling himself that carrying five bars eachtime would make it only ten trips, and the less trips, the better. He carriedfive the second trip, and the third. By the fourth time he returned to thefoundry, he decided that he would have to make an extra trip in order to givehimself a break and only carry four bars for a few of the trips. He lost trackof how many times he went back and forth throughout the empty night. The next tolast time, he struggled to lift but two bars. That left three. He forced himselfto carry all three the last time, trading the extra effort for the lesserdistance.He got the last three bars to Victor’s place before dawn. His shoulders werebruised and painful. He had to walk all the way to his job at Ishaq’s place, sohe couldn’t wait for Victor to arrive to complete his payment of the lastquarter gold mark.The day of work was a break from the night of exhausting lugging of iron bars.Jori didn’t talk unless spoken to, so Richard lay in the wagon bed with a loadof charcoal and snatched a few minutes of sleep here and there as the wagonbounced along. He only felt relieved that he had done as he had promised.As he returned home after an interminable day, Richard looked up and saw Kamiland Nabbi standing at the head of the stairs. They both had on shirts.“We’ve been waiting for you to come home and finish the job,” Kamil said.Richard swayed on his feet. “What job?”“The stairs.”“We did that last night.”“You did only the stairs in the front. You said you intended to fix the stairs.The front is only part of the stairs. The back stairs are twice as long and inworse shape than the front were. You don’t want your wife and the other women ofthe building to fall and break their necks when they go out back to the cookinghearth or the privy, do you?”This was their idea of a little test. Richard knew he would lose an opportunityif he put them off. He was so tired he couldn’t think straight.Nicci stuck her head out the front door. “I thought I heard your voice. Come into dinner. I have soup waiting on you.”“Got any tea?”Nicci cast a sidelong glance at the two in shirts. “I can make tea. Come on, andI’ll get it while you have your soup.”“Please bring it out to the back,” Richard said. “I promised to fix the stairs.”“Now?”“There are still a couple hours of light. I can eat while we’re working.”Kamil and Nabbi asked more questions than the evening before. The third youth,Gadi, passed by occasionally as Richard and the other two worked. Gadi, withouthis shirt, made a point of looking Nicci up and down when she brought Richardhis soup and tea.When Richard had finally finished, he went to the room that had once beenIshaq’s parlor, and was now his and Nicci’s home. He took off his shirt andsplashed water on his face from the washbasin. His head was throbbing.“Wash your hair,” Nicci said. “You’re filthy. I don’t want lice in here.”Rather than argue that he had no lice, Richard dipped his face in the water andscrubbed his head with the cake of coarse soap. It was easier than talking herout of it so he could go to sleep. Nicci hated lice.He was thankful, he supposed, that she was at least a clean wife in theirfraudulent arrangement. She kept the room, bedding, and his clothes clean,despite the difficulty of hauling water from the well down the street. She neverobjected to any work necessary to simulate the lives of normal people. Sheseemed to want something so badly that she often lost herself in the role to theextent that while he never forgot she was a Sister of the Dark and his captor,she occasionally did. He dunked his head again, swishing his hair, rinsing outthe soap.As a stream of water ran off his chin and back into the basin, he asked, “Who isBrother Narev?”Nicci, sitting on her pallet sewing, paused and looked up. Her sewing suddenlylooked out of place, as if her parody of domestic life lost its aura for her.“Why do you ask?”“I met him yesterday, out at the blacksmith’s.”“Out at the site of the project?”Richard nodded. “I had to deliver iron out there.”She bent back to her needlework. Richard watched in the light of the linseed-oillamp sitting beside her as she took a few more stitches in the patch to theknees of a pair of his pants. She finally paused and let her arms, one sheathedin his pant leg, sink to her lap.“Brother Narev is the high priest of the Fellowship of Order-an ancient sectdevoted to doing the Creator’s will in this world. He is the heart and soul ofthe Order-their moral guide-so to speak. He and his disciples lead the righteouspeople of the Order in the ways of the everlasting Light of the Creator. He isan advisor to Emperor Jagang.”Richard was taken aback. He hadn’t expected her to be so versed on the subject.His caution, along with the hair at the back of his neck, lifted.“What sort of advisor?”She took another stitch, pulling the long thread through. “Brother Narev wasJagang’s pedagogue-his teacher, advisor, and mentor. Brother Narev put the firein Jagang’s belly.”“He’s a wizard, isn’t he.” It was more statement than question.She looked up from her sewing. He could see in her blue eyes that she wasweighing whether or not to tell him, or perhaps how much she wanted to tell him.His steady gaze told her that he was expecting the whole truth.“In the language of the street, you could describe him as such.”“What does that mean?”“Common people, those who understand little about magic, would describe him as awizard. Strictly speaking, though, he is not a wizard.”“Then what is he? Strictly speaking.”“Actually, he is a sorcerer.”Richard could only stare at her. He had always assumed that a wizard and asorcerer were the same thing. When he thought about it, he realized that peoplewho knew about magic spoke exclusively of a male with the gift as a wizard. Hehad never heard any of those people mention a sorcerer.“You mean he’s like you, like a sorceress, only male?”The question stymied her for a moment. “I suppose you could think of it thatway, but that’s not really right. If you want to compare it, then you would haveto say he has more in common with a wizard, since both are male. The concept ofsorceress introduces irrelevant issues.”Richard swiped water from his face. “Please, Nicci, I’ve been up all last nightworking, and I’m dead on my feet. Don’t go all abstract and complex on me? Justtell me what it means?”She set her sewing aside and gestured to his pallet for him to sit near her, inthe light. Richard pulled his shirt back on. He yawned as he crossed his legsunder himself on his pallet.“Brother Narev is a sorcerer,” she began. “I’m sorry, but the distinction isjust not something simply explained. It’s a very complex matter. I will try tomake it as clear as I can, but you must understand that I can’t boil it down toomuch or it will lose any real flavor of the truth.“Sorcerers are much the same as wizards, but different-in much the way thatwater and oil are both liquids, you might say. Both pour and can dissolvethings, but they don’t mix and they dissolve different things. Neither do themagic of a wizard and a sorcerer mix, nor do they work on the same things.“Anything he did against a wizard’s gift, or anything a wizard did against his,would not work. While both are the gift, they are different aspects-they don’tmix. The magic of each nullifies the other, making it just sort of . . .fizzle.”“You mean like Additive and Subtractive are opposites?”“No. While on the surface, that would seem a good way to understand it, it’sentirely the wrong way to think of it.” She lifted her hands as if to beginagain, but then let them drop back into her lap. “It’s very hard to explain thedifference to one such as you who has little understanding of how his own giftworks; you have no basis in which to ground anything I could tell you. There areno words which are both accurate and which you would understand; this is beyondyour understanding.”“Well . . . do you mean that, much like a wolf and a cougar are both predators,they are not the same sort of creature?”“That’s a little closer to it.”“How common are these sorcerers?”“About as common as dream walkers...” she said as she gave him a meaningfullook, “or war wizards.”Even though he couldn’t understand it and she couldn’t explain it, Richard, forsome reason, found that bit of news troubling.“What is it, though, that he does differently?”Nicci let out a sigh. “I’m no expert, and I’m not entirely sure, but I believehe does the same basic sort of things a wizard would do, but just does them witha sorcerer’s unique quality of magic-liquor and ale both get you drunk, but theyare different kinds of drink made from different things.”“One of those is stronger.”-“Not so with wizards and sorcerers. Do you see why words and these kinds ofcomparisons are so inadequate? The strength of a wizard and sorcerer’s gift isdependent on the individual, it is not influenced by the fundamental nature ofhis magic.”Richard scratched his stubble as he considered her words. In view of the factthat both could do magic, he couldn’t come up with any distinction that seemedof any practical importance.“Is there anything that he can do that a wizard can’t?” He waited. She didn’tlook like she was thinking about his question, but more like she was consideringwhether she wanted to answer it at all. “Nicci, you told me when you firstcaptured me that you would tell me the truth about things. You said you had noreason to deceive me.”She watched his eyes, but finally looked away as she pulled her blond hair backfrom her face. The gesture unexpectedly, painfully, reminded him of Kahlan.“Perhaps. I believe he may have learned how to replicate the spell thatsurrounded the Palace of the Prophets. It took wizards, thousands of years ago,with both sides of the gift to create that particular spell. I believe that oneof the ways sorcerers are different is that their power is not divisible intoits constituent elements, as it is in wizards. So, while his magic worksdifferently, he may have learned enough of how the wizards-who at that timepossessed both sides of the gift, as do you-were able to create the spell aroundthe Palace of the Prophets to be able to replicate it in his own fashion.”“You mean the spell that slowed aging? You think he can cast such a web?”“Yes. Jagang intimated as much to me. I knew Brother Narev when I was young. Hewas a grown man then, a visionary, preaching the doctrine of the Order. He spokepensively about wishing to live long enough to see his vision of the Order cometo fruition. When I was taken to live at the palace in Tanimura, I believe thatmay have given him the idea as he not long after went there, too.“The Sisters knew nothing of him. They thought him no more than a humble worker.Since his gift is different than that of a wizard, they didn’t detect hisability. I now believe that he went there for the express purpose of studyingthe spell around the Palace of the Prophets so that he could re-create such aspell for his own benefit.”“Why didn’t he storm the palace-take it over-and then he could have the spellfor his purpose?”“It’s possible that in the beginning he thought he might one day take over thepalace for his cause-in fact, Emperor Jagang had that exact plan-but it’s alsopossible that he was from the beginning studying the spell because he wanted notsimply to re-create it, but to enhance it.”Richard rubbed his brow, trying to comfort his aching head. “You mean that nowmaybe he thinks he can create the spell over the Retreat-the emperor’s newpalace-like that one at the Palace of the Prophets, but better, so that agingwill be slowed even more, so that he and his chosen will live even longer?”“Yes. Don’t forget, age is relative. To one who lives to a thousand years,living less than one century would seem all too brief. To a person who livesmany thousands of years, though, a lifetime that lasts but a mere one millenniumwould seem fleeting.“I suspect that Brother Narev has learned to slow aging to such an extent thatit would make him the next best thing to immortal. Jagang had planned oncapturing the Palace of the Prophets. It might have been that once they securedthe palace, Brother Narev intended to augment its spell to suit his purposes.”“But I spoiled that plan.”Nicci nodded. “As are all of us who were once at the palace, Brother Narev nowgrows older just like everyone else. Once away from the spell, it feels like aheadlong rush toward the grave. What youth Brother Narev has left, he is nodoubt eager to preserve. Remaining relatively young forever has much to be saidfor it. Remaining old forever would be less attractive. Because you destroyedthe Palace of the Prophets, where he could have had ample time to bring his planto bear, he has been forced to act sooner, rather than later.”Richard flopped back on his mat. He laid the back of a wrist over his forehead.“He has the blacksmith making a spell-form in iron. The blacksmith has no ideawhat it is he’s creating. The spell-form is to be covered with gold,eventually.”“For purity. It’s likely that is merely part of the process. It could even bethat the gold-covered spellform is nothing more than a pattern, from which thetrue spellform will be cast in pure gold.”Richard squinted in thought. “If it is a pattern for casting, that would make itmore likely that Narev intends to cast a number of these spell-forms-that theywill work together.”Nicci looked up and frowned. “Yes, that is a possibility.”“Will making such a thing harm the blacksmith?”“No. It is propitious conjuring. Disregarding for the moment the purpose forwhich it is desired, such a spell is meant to be beneficial; it is to slow agingin order to lengthen life.”“What about Brother Narev’s disciples?”“Young wizards from the Palace of the Prophets.”Alarmed, Richard sat up. “I was at the Palace of the Prophets. They willrecognize me.” ‘“No. They were young wizards in training there, but they left to follow BrotherNarev before you arrived. If they see you, they will not know you.”“If they’re wizards, won’t they recognize that I have magic?”A smile of contempt colored her features. “They are not that talented. They arebut bugs to what you are.”Richard found no comfort in the compliment. “Won’t Brother Narev, or hisdisciples, recognize you?”Her face turned serious. “Oh, they would know me.”“It sounds as if Brother Narev must be strong in his gift. Won’t he be able torecognize that I have the gift? He was looking at me strangely. He asked if heknew me. He sensed something.”“Why did you think him a wizard?”Richard picked at the straw stuffing coming out of the pad over his pallet as heconsidered the question.“There was nothing that gave it away for a fact, but I strongly suspected itfrom a lot of little things: the way he carried himself; the way he looked atpeople; the way he spoke-everything about him. Only after I surmised that Narevwas a wizard did I realize that the thing the blacksmith was making for himlooked like some sort of spell-form.”“He would suspect you of being gifted in much the same way. Can you tell thedifference?”“Yes. I’ve learned to recognize an ageless look in their eyes. I can in some waysee the aura of the gift around those in whom it is powerful-you, for instance.At times, the air crackles around you.”She stared in fascination. “I’ve never heard of such a thing. It must havesomething do to with you having both sides.”“You have both sides. Don’t you see it?”“No, but I acquired the Subtractive side in a different manner.”She had given her soul to the Keeper of the underworld.“But you see nothing of the sort in Brother Narev, do you?” When Richard shookhis head, she went on with her explanation. “That is because, as I explained,you have different aspects of the gift. Other than with your faculty of reason,you have no wizardly ability to recognize the gift in him; he has no sorcerousability to recognize the gift in you. Your magic won’t work on one another. Onlyyour faculty of reason betrayed his gift to you.”Richard realized that, without saying it, she was telling him that if he didn’twant Narev to learn that he had the gift, then he had better be careful aroundthe man.There were times when he thought he had her game figured out.There were times, like now, when it seemed his entire perception of her purposeshifted. At times, it almost seemed to him as if she threw her beliefs in hisface, not because she believed them, but because she was desperately hoping fora reason not to, hoping he would find her in some lost, dark world and show herthe way out. Richard sighed inwardly; he had given her his arguments as to whyher beliefs were wrong, but, rather than sway her, it only angered her, at best,or worse, further entrenched her in her convictions.As tired as he was, he lay in his bed, his eyes but narrow slits, watching Niccilit by the light of a single wick, bent in - concentration over her sewing-oneof the most powerful women ever to walk the world, and she appeared perfectlycontent to sew a patch in the knee of his pants.She accidentally stuck herself with the needle. As she shook her hand and wincedwith the pain, Richard had the sudden cold recollection of the link between herand Kahlan; his beloved would feel that prick."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 50Richard took the snow-white slice when Victor held it out.“What’s this?”“Try it,” Victor said as he waved an insistent hand. “Eat. Tell me what youthink. It’s from my homeland. Here, a red onion goes well with it.”The white slice was smooth, dense, and rich with salt and herbs. Richard let outa rapturous moan. He rolled his eyes.“Victor, this is the best thing I’ve ever had. What is it?”“Lardo.”They sat on the threshold of the double doors out of the room with the marblemonolith, watching dawn break over the site, where the walls of the Retreat hadbegun to rise. Only a few people stirred below. Before long, laborers wouldarrive in great numbers to begin again their work on the Retreat. It went onevery day without pause, rain or shine. Now that spring was wearing on, theweather was pleasant nearly every day, with afternoon rains every few days, butnothing dreary or oppressive-just enough to wash you clean and make you feelrefreshed.If not for the ever-present ache of missing Kahlan, his worry over the war farto the north, his loathing of being held prisoner, the slave labor at the site,the abuse of people, the people who disappeared or those who confessed undertorture, and the grindingly repressive nature of life in Altur’Rang, he mighthave found the spring quite enjoyable.Day by day, too, his worry grew that Kahlan would soon be able to leave theirmountain home. He dreaded her getting caught up in such a war as would be soonbe roaring into full flame.After he had eaten some of the mild onion, Richard went back to the delightfullardo. He moaned again.“Victor, I’ve never tasted anything like this. What’s lardo?”Victor held out another thin slice. Richard gladly accepted. After a long nightof work, the dense delicacy was really hitting the spot.Victor gestured with his knife to the tin beside him holding the pure whiteblock. “Lardo is paunch fat from the boar.”“And this tin of it is from your homeland?”“No, no-I make it myself. I come from far to the south of here, far away-nearthe sea. That is where we make lardo. When I come here, I make it here.“I put the paunch fat in tubs I carved myself out of marble as white as thelardo.” Victor gestured with his hands as he spoke, working the air asvigorously as he worked iron. “The fat is put in the tubs with coarse salt androsemary and other spices. From time to time I turn it in the brine. It mustrest a year in the stone to cure, to became lardo.”“A year!..Victor nodded emphatically. “This we are eating, I made last spring. My fathertaught me to make lardo. Lardo is something only men make. My father was aquarry worker. Lardo gives quarry workers the stamina they need to work longhours sawing blocks of our marble, or swinging a pickaxe. For blacksmiths, too,lardo gives you power to lift a hammer all day.”“So, there are quarries where you lived?”He waved his thick hand at the towering block behind them. “This. This isCavatura marble-from my homeland.” He pointed out at several of the stock areasbelow. “That, there, and there, i’s marble from Cavatura, too.”“That’s where you’re from? Cavatura?”Victor grinned like a wolf as he nodded. “The place where all that beautifulmarble came from. Our city gets its name from the marble quarries. My family areall carvers, or quarry workers. Me? I end up a blacksmith making tools forthem.”“Blacksmiths are sculptors.”He grunted a laugh. “And you? Where are you from?”“Me? Far away. They had no marble there. Only granite.” Richard changed thesubject, lest he have to start inventing lies. Besides, it was getting light.“So, Victor, when do you need more of that special steel?”“Tomorrow. Are you up to it?”The steel Victor needed was from farther away, at a foundry out near thecharcoal makers. They needed a lot of charcoal to cook with the iron to makehigh-grade steel. Ore came in by barge, from not far away. It would take most ofthe night for Richard to get there and back.“Sure. I will be sick today and get some sleep.”He had become sick quite a lot over the last several months. It fit right inwith the way most of the others worked. Work some, be sick, tell the workers’group that you were ailing. Some people limped in with a story. It wasn’tnecessary; the workers’ group never questioned.The only thing he rarely missed were the meetings where those with bad attitudeswere named. People at the meetings were often named, but you were more likely tobring attention if you missed the meetings. Those named were often subsequentlyarrested and given an opportunity to confess. More than once, a person named ata meeting as having an unsatisfactory attitude killed themselves.“One of Brother Narev’s disciples, Neal, came around last evening with some neworders.” Victor’s voice had taken on a tense edge. “What you just brought willlast me the day, but I need that steel by tomorrow.”“You will have it.”“Are you sure?”“Have I ever let you down, Victor?”Victor’s hard face melted into a helpless smile. He passed Richard another sliceof lardo. “No, Richard, you never have. Not once. I had given up hope of evermeeting another man who kept his word.”“Well, I’d best be off and take care of my horses. They’ve had a hard night, andI’ll need them rested for tonight. How much steel do you need?”“Two hundred. Half square, and half round.”Richard performed a pained moan. “You’re going to make me strong, or kill me,Victor.”Victor smiled his approval. “You want the gold?”“No. You can pay me when I deliver.”Richard no longer needed the money in advance. He had a heavy wagon, now, and astrong team of horses. He paid Ishaq to care for them along with the transportcompany’s teams in the company stables. Ishaq helped Richard with any number ofthe special arrangements that he’d had to make. Ishaq knew which officials livedin the nice homes. They couldn’t afford those homes with just their pay asofficials of the Order.“You be careful of Neal,” Richard said.“Why’s that?”“For some reason, he believes I’m in need of lecturing. He truly believes thatthe Order is mankind’s savior. He puts the good of the fellowship of Order abovethe good of mankind.”Victor sighed as he stood and tied on his leather apron. “My thoughts about him,too.”As they passed into the building, the sun was just lighting the marble standingthere. Richard lingered and put a hand to the cold stone, as he always didwhenever he passed it. It almost felt alive to him. Alive with potential.“Victor, I asked you once what this was. Mind telling me, now?”The blacksmith paused beside Richard and gazed up at the pure stone before him.He reached out and touched it lightly, letting his fingertips glide over thesurface, testing, caressing.“This is my statue.”“What statue?”“The one I want to carve, someday. Many in my family are carvers. As far back asI can remember, I always wanted to carve, too. I wanted to be a great sculptor.I wanted to create great works.“Instead, I had to work for the master blacksmith at the quarry. My familyneeded to eat. I was the oldest living son. My father and the blacksmith werefriends. My father asked the blacksmith to take me on .... He didn’t wantanother son lost to the stone. It’s a hard and dangerous life, cutting stonefrom a mountain.”“Did you carve other things? I mean, like wood, or something.”Victor, still staring at his stone, shook his head. “I only wanted to carvestone. I bought this block with my savings. I own it. Few men can say they own apart of a mountain. A part as pure and beautiful as this.”Richard could understand the sentiments. “So, Victor, what will you carve out ofit?”He squinted, as if trying to peer beyond the surface. “I don’t know. They saythat the stone will speak to you and tell you what it should be.”“Do you believe that?”Victor laughed his deep laugh. “No-not really. But the thing is, this is abeautiful piece of stone. There is none finer for statues than Cavatura marble,and few blocks of Cavatura marble with as fine a grain as this piece. I couldn’tbear to see it carved up into something ugly, like what they carve nowadays.“It used to be, long ago, that only beauty was carved from beauty such as this.No more,” he whispered in distant bitterness. “Now, man must be carved with atwisted nature-as an object of shame.”Richard had delivered tools down to the site for Victor, down to where thecarving was taking place, and had had the opportunity to get a closer look atthe work being done. The outside of the stone walls was to be covered withexpansive scenes on a scale that was staggering. The walls that would enclosethe palace went on for miles. The carvings being produced for the Retreat werethe same as those Richard had seen everywhere in the Old World, but would haveno equal in sheer, overpowering quantity. The entire palace was to be an epicportrayal of the Order’s view of the nature of life, and of redemption in theafterlife of the underworld.The figures being carved were stilted, with limbs that could not possiblyfunction. Those carved in relief were forever bound to the stone from which theyonly haltingly emerged. The poses reflected a view of man as ineffective,shallow, unsubstantial.The elements of the hated anatomy of man, his muscle, bone, and flesh, weremelted together into lifeless limbs, their proportions distorted to strip thefigures of their humanity. Expressions were either impassive, if the statue wassupposed to portray virtue, or filled with terror, agony, torment, if intendedto illustrate the fate of evildoers. Proper men and women, bent under the weightof labor, were always made to look out at the world through the vacant stupor ofresignation.Most often, it was difficult to tell male from female; their worldly bodies, aneverlasting source of shame, were hidden by bulky garments like those thepriests of the Order wore. Further reflecting the Order’s teachings, only thesinful were shown naked, so that all could see their detestable cankerousbodies.The carvings represented man as helpless, doomed by the inadequacy of hisintellect to suffer every blow of existence.Most of the sculptors, Richard suspected, feared to be questioned, or eventortured, and so repeated the view that man was to be carved accepting his vilenature, thus earning his reward only through death. The carvings were meant toassure the masses that this was the only proper goal for which man could hope.Richard knew that a few of the carvers vehemently believed such teachings. Hewas always careful of what he said around them.“Ah, Richard, I wish you could see beautiful statues, instead of today’sscourge.”“I have seen statues of great beauty,” Richard softly assured the man.“Have you? I’m so glad. People should see those things, not this, this”-he waveda hand toward the rising walls of the Retreat-”this evil in the guise ofgoodness.”“So you will one day carve such beauty?”“I don’t know, Richard,” he finally admitted. “The Order takes everything. Theysay that the individual is of no importance except inasmuch as he can contributeto the good of others. They take what art can be, the lifeblood of the soul, andturn it to poison, turn it to death.”Victor smiled wistfully. “This way, as it is, I can enjoy the beautiful statueinside the stone.”“I understand, Victor-I really do. The way you describe it, I can see it, too.”“We will both enjoy my statue the way it is, then.” Victor took his hand fromthe stone and pointed to the base. “Besides, you see there? There is animperfection in the stone. It runs all the way through. That is why I couldafford this piece of marble-because it has this flaw. Were most anyone to carvethis, it would endanger the stone. If not done just right, and with the flawtaken in mind, the entire piece could easily shatter. I have never been able tothink of how to carve this stone to take advantage of its beauty, but to alsoavoid the flaw.”“Perhaps, someday, it will come to you how to carve the stone, to create a thingof nobility.”“Nobility. Ali, but wouldn’t that be something-the most sublime form of beauty.”He shook his head. “But I will not do it. Not unless the revolt comes.”“Revolt?”Victor’s careful gaze swept the hillside through the open door. “The revolt. Itwill come. The Order cannot stand-evil cannot stand, not forever, anyway. In myhomeland, when I was young, there used to be beauty, and there used to befreedom. They were shamed into giving up their lives, their freedom, bit by bit,to the cause of fairness to all men. People didn’t know what they had, and letfreedom slip away for nothing but the hollow promise of a better world, a worldwithout effort, without struggle to achieve, without productive work. It wasalways someone else who would do these things, who would provide, who would maketheir lives easy.“We used to be a land of abundance. Now, what food is grown, rots, while itawaits committees to decide who should have it, who should move it, and what itshould cost. Meanwhile, people starve.“Insurgents, those disloyal to the Order, are blamed for all the starvation andstrife that slowly destroys us, and so ever more people are arrested and put todeath. We are a land of death. The Order continually proclaims its feelings formankind, but their ways can but cultivate death. On my way here, I have seencorpses by the thousands go uncounted and unburied. The New World is blamed forevery ill, every failure, and young men, eager to smite their oppressors, marchoff to war.“Many people, though, have come to see the truth. They, and the children ofthese people-me, and others like me-hunger for freedom to live our own lives,rather than be slaves to the Order and their reign of death. There is unrest inmy homeland, as there is here. A revolt is coming.”“Unrest? Here? I’ve seen no unrest.”Victor smiled a sly smile. “Those with revolt in their hearts do not show theirtrue feelings. The Order, always fearful of insurrection, tortures confessionsfrom those they wrongly arrest. Every day more are put to death. Those who wantthings to change know better than to make themselves targets before the time hascome. Someday, Richard, revolt will come.”Richard shook his head. “I don’t know, Victor. Revolt takes resolve. I don’tthink such real resolve exists.”“You have seen people who are unhappy with the way things are. Ishaq, those atthe foundries, my men and me. All those you deal with, other than the officialsyou bribe, hunger for change.” Victor lifted an eyebrow at Richard. “Not one ofthem complains to any board or committee about what you do. You may want nothingto do with it, as I believe is your right, but there are those who listen to thewhispers of the freedom to the north.”Richard tensed. “Freedom to the north?”Victor nodded solemnly. “They speak of a savior: Richard Rahl. He leads them inthe fight for freedom. They say that this Richard Rahl will bring us ourrevolt.”Had it not all been so overwhelmingly tragic, Richard would have burst outlaughing.“How do you know this Rahl character is worth following?”Victor fixed Richard with a look that Richard remembered from the first time hemet the blacksmith.“You can judge a man by his enemies. Richard Rahl is hated by the emperor, andby Brother Narev, and by his disciples, as no other man is hated. He is the one.He bears the torch of revolution.”Richard could muster only a desolate smile. “He is but a man, my friend. Don’tworship a man. Worship his cause, but not him.”Victor’s glare, so full of his emotion, his burning hunger for freedom, turnedback to his wolfish grin.“Ah, but that is what Richard Rahl would say. That is why he is the one.”Richard thought it would be best to change the subject. He saw that it wasgetting light.“Well, I have to get going. I’m sure you’ll figure out what to do with thestone, Victor. It will come to you when the time is right.”The blacksmith feigned a scowl, but it was a poor spoof of the very real onethat had just departed. “That is always what I thought, too.”Richard scratched his head. “Have you ever carved anything Victor?”“No, nothing.”“Are you sure you are able to carve? That you have the ability?”Victor tapped his temple, as if to dissuade a skeptic. “In here I have ability.In here I have beauty. That is all that matters to me. If I never touch steel tothis stone, then I will always have the beauty of what it could be, and that,the Order can never take away from me.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 51Nicci wiped the sweat off her brow as she went down the line, checking to see ifher clothes were dry. Summer was only around the corner, and it was already hot.Her back hurt from her earlier work at the washtub and various other chores. Theother women were chatting in the warm sunshine. They occasionally giggled oversome quirk that one of them, after a round of amiable urging, would divulgeabout her husband. Everyone in the building, it seemed, had begun coming alivealong with the new spring growth.Nicci knew that spring had nothing to do with it.That knowledge drew frustration up from her darkest recesses. She couldn’tfigure out how Richard did it. No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn’tunravel the knot he seemed to tie around everything. She was beginning tobelieve that if she took him down into the deepest cave she could find, thesunlight would make its way into the darkest recesses to shine on him. She wouldthink it was some kind of magical luck, except she knew beyond doubt that he hadnot used any magic whatsoever.The backyard, such an overgrown tangled place, so filthy, with piles of scrapand garbage, was now a garden. The men who lived in the building, after theycame home from work, had rid the yard of the refuse. Even several of the oneswho didn’t work had come out of their rooms to help cart away an item or two.After it was cleared out,- the women of the building had turned the soil andplanted a garden. They were going to have vegetables. Vegetables! There was talkof getting a few chickens.The single latrine off in the back corner, so overused and so foul, was now twoprivies in good repair. Now, there was rarely a wait to use a privy and therewere no more urgent pleas or frayed tempers. Kamil and Nabbi had helped Richardbuild them-partly out of scraps of lumber salvaged from the refuse piles in theyard, before they were hauled away, and some they collected from other rubbishheaps.Nicci had hardly believed her eyes when she had seen Kamil and Nabbi-inshirts---digging the holes for the new privies. Everyone thanked them profusely.The two toughs beamed with pride.The outdoor cooking hearth had been repaired, so the women could set more potsin it and cook at the same time, requiring less wood to be hauled. Richard andsome of the other men of the building built stands for the washtubs, so thewives wouldn’t have to bend so far or chafe their knees raw. The men made asimple roof of canvas salvaged from the refuse so that the women could cook andwash without getting wet when it rained.The people in the buildings to either side, at first surly and suspicious of theactivity, began asking curt questions. Richard, Kamil, and Nabbi went over andexplained what they had done, and how they could put their place in shape, too,and even helped them get started. Nicci had yelled at Richard for spending histime at other people’s places. He said that she was the one who had told himthat it was his duty to help others. Nicci had no answer-at least, none thatmade any sense so as she could say it aloud and not sound a fool.When Richard showed people how to improve their homes, he didn’t lecture, orteach, but rather, somehow-Nicci couldn’t understand how-managed to infect themwith his enthusiasm. He hadn’t told them what to do, but rather he’d made thempant to figure out for themselves how they could make things better forthemselves. Everybody took a liking to Richard. It made her growl under herbreath.Nicci collected her washing in the woven basket Richard had shown the women ofthe building how to make from thin strips of wood. Nicci had to admit that thebasket was easy enough to make, and a better way to lug clothes.She climbed the sturdy stairs-stairs that she’d once thought would be the end ofher. The hallway inside was spotless. The floors had been washed. SomewhereRichard had come up with ingredients for paint, and the men had a grand time ofmixing it up and painting over the stains on the walls. One of the men in thebuilding knew about roofs, so he fixed the roof so it wouldn’t leak and stainthe walls again.As Nicci walked down the hall, she saw Gadi, without his shirt, sitting up thestairway, in the shadows. He was using his big knife to whittle at a piece ofwood and in so doing make clear his dangerous nature. Later, the women living inthe building would tsk and clean it up. Gadi, not happy about people nagging athim of late, leered down at her. She now had something for him to leer at, nowthat she had gained her weight back.Richard’s second job at night enabled him to be able to afford more food. Hebrought home things she had missed for months-chicken, oil, spices, bacon,cheese, and eggs. She could never find such things in the city stores, Nicci hadthought they sold the same food everywhere in the city shops, but Richard’stravels while delivering things, he said, took him to places where they sold awider variety of food.Kamil and Nabbi, sitting on the front steps, saw her through the open door. Theystood and bowed politely as she came down the hall.“Good evening, Mrs. Cypher,” Kamil said.“Could we help you carry that?” Nabbi asked.She found it all the more irritating because she knew for a fact that they weresincere; they liked her because she was Richard’s wife.“Thank you, no. I’m there, now.”They held the door for her and closed it behind her when she had passed into herroom.She thought of them as Richard’s soldiers. He seemed to have a private army ofpeople who broke into grins when they saw him coming. Most people seemed onlytoo pleased to do whatever they thought Richard might like done. Kamil and Nabbiwould have washed diapers, if he asked it, for the chance to ride with him atnight in the wagon as he picked up and delivered things around Altur’Rang. Heonly rarely took them with him, saying that he could get in trouble with theworkers’ group. The youths didn’t want Richard to get in trouble and lose hisjob, so they patiently waited for the rare times when he tilted his head forthem to come along.Their room had been transformed. The ceiling had been cleaned and whitewashed.The flyblown walls had been scrubbed and painted a salmon color-a color she hadpicked, thinking that Richard would not possibly be able to come up with therare ingredients needed for the color. The walls were now mockingly salmon.One day a man had shown up with an armload of tools. Kamil said that Richard hadsent him over to fix their room. The man spoke a language Nicci didn’tunderstand. He waved his arms a lot and chattered and laughed good-naturedly, asif she must understand at least a little of what he told her. He pointed aroundat walls and asked questions. She hadn’t the foggiest notion of what he wasthere to do.She suspected he had come to fix the wobbly table. She rapped the top with theflat of her hand and then showed him how it wobbled. He nodded and grinned andchattered. She finally left him to his work while she went to the city store towait in line to buy bread. She was there the entire morning. In the afternoon,she waited in line for millet.When Nicci finally returned home, the man was gone. The old window, broken andnot only long painted over but also painted shut, had new glass, and it wasraised. And, they had a new window in the other wall. Both windows were open. Acool cross-breeze let fresh air into the stuffy room.Nicci stood in the center of the room, stunned to be looking through the windowto the building next door. She gaped out the window in the wall where there hadbeen no window before. She was able to see the street. Mrs. Sha’Rim, from nextdoor, had smiled and waved as she’d walked past.Nicci set down the wash basket and opened the window at the side, to get someair into the stifling room. She pushed the curtains back. With windows you couldsee though, she had decided that curtains were in order. Richard somehow got herfabric. When she was finished, he told her she had done a wonderful job. Niccifound herself grinning just as everyone else grinned when Richard told them theyhad done well.She had brought Richard to the worst place in the Old World, to the worstbuilding she could find, and he somehow ended up making everything better justas she had insisted was his duty.But she had never meant it to be like this.She didn’t know what she’d meant.She only knew that she lived for the times Richard was with her. Even though sheknew he hated her, and wanted nothing more than to be away from her and backwith his Kahlan, Nicci could not help feeling her heart rise into her throatwhen he came home. Through the link to Kahlan, she thought that at times shecould feel the woman’s longing for him. Every inch of her ached withunderstanding of Kahlan’s longing.The room grew darker as she waited. Life didn’t start until Richard came home.As the daylight faded, the lamplight took its place. They had a real lamp, now,not just a wick through a wooden button floating in linseed oil.The door opened. Richard put one foot inside. He was speaking to Kamil as theyoung man was going off to his family’s place upstairs. It was getting late.Finally, still smiling, Richard came in and shut the door. The smile faded, asit always did.He held out a burlap sack. “I came across some onions, carrots, and some pork. Ithought you might like to make a stew.”Nicci lifted a hand weekly toward the millet she had spent the afternoon in lineto buy. It had bugs in it. It was moldy.“I bought millet. I thought I would make you a soup.”Richard shrugged. “If you prefer. Your millet soup saw us through some prettylean times.”Nicci felt that flash of pride that he had acknowledged what she had done asvaluable.She shut the windows. It was dark out. With her back to the windows as shewatched him, she closed the curtains tight.Richard stood in the center of the room, watching her, a puzzled frown creasinghis brow between his eyes. Nicci closed the distance to him. She was aware ofthe exposed flesh of her bosom rising and falling above the top of her blackdress. Gadi had just been staring at her bosom. She wanted Richard to stare ather like that. Richard watched only her eyes.Her fingers tightened around his muscled arms.“Make love to me,” she whispered.His brow drew down. “What?”“Richard, I want you to make love to me. Now.”He appraised her eyes for an eternity. Her heart thundered in her ears. Everyfiber of her being screamed out for him to take her. She teetered on the edge,waiting, her life suspended in the exquisite anguish of expectation.His voice came, not at all harsh. If anything, it was tender, but it was alsoresolute. “No.”Nicci felt as if a thousand needles of ice were dancing up her arms. His refusalstunned her. No man had ever refused her.It hurt to her core--worse than anything Jagang or any other man had ever done.She had thought . . .Blood rushed to her face, melting the ice in a flash of heat. Nicci flung openthe door. “Come out into the hall and wait,” she commanded in a shaky voice.He was standing in the center of their room, looking into her eyes. The lamp onthe table cast harsh shadows across his face. His shoulders looked so broad,tapering down to his waist, a waist she ached to encircle with her arms. Shewanted to scream. Instead she spoke softly, but with authority he could notmistake.“You will come out into the hall and wait, or. . .”Nicci made a snipping gesture with two fingers.By the look in his eyes, he knew that she was not bluffing. Kahlan’s life nowhung by a thread, and if he didn’t do as she ordered, she would not hesitate tocut that thread.With his gray eyes on her the whole time, Richard stepped out into the hall. Sheput a finger to the center of his chest and pushed until his back was againstthe wall beside their door.“You are to wait right there, on that spot, until I tell you that you may movefrom it.” She gritted her teeth. “Or Kahlan will die. Do you understand?”“Nicci, you’re better than this. Think about what you’re-”“Or Kahlan will die. Do you understand?”He let out a breath. “Yes.”Nicci marched to the stairwell. Gadi stood halfway up the stairs, his dark eyeswatching. He arrogantly descended toward her, until he was at the bottom withher. He had a fine form, she supposed, displayed as it was without a shirt. Hewas close enough to feel the heat of him.Nicci looked him in the eye. He was the same height as she.“I want you to have sex with me.”“What?”“My husband does not adequately take care of my needs. I wish you to.”A smirk spread on his face as his gaze slid to Richard. He looked back at herbosom, at what was within his power to possess.Gadi was young and bold and stupid enough to believe himself irresistible toher, to believe his puerile primping had swept away her inhibitions to the pointof helpless lust for what he had to offer.One arm pulled her to him. With his other hand, he swept her hair out of theway. His thin lips kissed her neck. When his teeth raked her flesh, she moanedto encourage him to be rough. The last thing in the world she wanted wastenderness. There could be no retribution in tenderness. Tenderness would notcleave Richard’s soul with anguish. Tenderness would not hurt him.Gadi’s hands squeezed her bottom, pulling her hard against his groin. He movedagainst her in a lewd fashion. She panted in his ear to encourage his confidencein his dominion over her body.“Tell me why.”“I’m sick of his gentle nature, his kind touch, his caring ways. That’s not whata real woman needs. I want him to know what a real man can do-I want what hecan’t give me.”She nearly cried out in pain when he twisted her nipple.“Yeah?”“Yes. I want what a real man like you can do for a woman.”His rough hands squeezed her breast. She performed another moan. He smiled.“My pleasure.”His smirk sickened her. “No, mine,” she whispered in breathy submission.He cast one more hateful glare at Richard, then bent to slip a hand up the frontof her dress to see if she really meant it, if she would really let him have hisway with her. His hand slid up the inside of her bare thigh, commandingsurrender. She obediently parted her legs for him.Nicci held on to his shoulders as he groped her. His upper lip curled in ahaughty grin. His fingers worked without mercy. Her eyes watered. She trembledand bit the inside of her cheek to hold back her cry. Mistaking agony for lust,he was inflamed by her whimpers.Jagang and his friend Kadar Kardeef, to name but a few, took her without herconsent. None of it had ever approached the sense of violation she felt at thatmoment as she stood there in the hall letting that smirking little thug do toher as he would.She forced her hand down between them and seized him.“Gadi, are you afraid of Richard? Are are you man enough to take me while he isoutside the room, listening to us, knowing you are his better with me?”“Afraid? Of him?” His voice came in a husky growl. “Just tell me when.”“Right now. I need it from you now, Gadi.”“I thought so.”Nicci smiled inwardly at his solemn look of lust.“Say `please,’ first, you little whore.”“Please.” She ached only to crush his worthless skull. “Please, Gadi.”With his arm around her waist, Gadi gave Richard a taunting sneer as heswaggered past. Nicci’s fingers on Gadi’s back urged him to go on into theirroom and wait. He smiled over his shoulder and did as she wanted. Nicci pausedto glare into Richard’s eyes.“We are linked. What happens to me, happens to her. I hope you are not foolishenough to think I wouldn’t make you sorry for the rest of your days if you don’tstay right there. I swear to you, she will die this night if you don’t staythere.”“Nicci, please don’t do this. You’re only hurting yourself.”His voice was so tender, so compassionate. She almost threw her arms around himto beg him to stop her . . . but the flame of his refusal still burnedshamefully in her heart.Nicci turned back from the doorway and gave Richard a vicious grin. “I hope yourKahlan enjoys this as much as I’m going to enjoy it. After tonight, she willnever believe in you again.”Kahlan gasped. Her eyes opened. She could only make out obscure shapes in theswirling darkness. She gasped again.A feeling she couldn’t define, couldn’t interpret, couldn’t put a nature to,welled up in her. It was something totally foreign, yet at the same timebewitchingly familiar. Something inappropriate, yet longed for. It filled herwith a kind of passionate terror that undulated seductively to indecentpleasure, pushing before it a sense of shapeless dread.She felt the weight of a shadow over her.Feelings and sensations she could not grasp or control inundated her even as shefought them. Nothing seemed real. She gasped again at the crude sensation. Itconfused her. It hurt, and at the same time she felt a kind of wild hungerawakening.It was as if Richard were there, in bed with her. It felt so good again. She waspanting. Her mouth was dry as dust.In Richard’s intimate embrace she had always felt a kind of expectant delightthat their shameless lust could never be completely sated-that there was alwaysa spark of something left to explore, to reach toward, to define. She had alwaysexalted in the idea of that endless quest for the unattainable.She drew a sharp breath. She felt herself in that headlong rush, now.But this was something she had never imagined. Her fists clutched at the sheets,her mouth opened in a silent scream against the ripping thrust of pain.This was not human. It made no sense. She gasped again in panic as the mostawful feelings burgeoned through her. She moaned at the horror of it, at thehint of pleasure in it, and at the confusion of nearly enjoying the sensation.The realization came to her. She knew what this meant.Tears stung her eyes. She rolled onto her side, torn between the joy of feelingRichard, and the pain of knowing that Nicci was feeling him in this way, too.She was slammed onto her back.She gasped again, her eyes going wide, her whole body rigid.She cried out at the pain. She twisted and struggled, covering her breasts withher arms. Her eyes watered at agony she couldn’t explain or completely identify.She missed Richard so much. She wanted him so badly it hurt.She gave in to him, even in this, she surrendered herself to him. A low wailescaped her throat.Her muscles knotted as tight as oak roots. She was racked with wave after waveof startling pain mixed with an unsatisfied longing that had turned torevulsion. She couldn’t get her breath.She burst into tears as it ceased, her body finally able to move again, but tooexhausted to do so. She had hated every violent appalling brutal second of it,and grieved that it had ended because she had at least felt him.She felt joy that she had so unexpectedly sensed him, and blind rage at what itmeant. She clutched the sheets in her fists as she wept inconsolably.“Mother Confessor?” A dark form slipped into the tent. “Mother Confessor?”It was Cara’s whisper. Cara set a candle on the table. The light seemedblindingly bright as Cara looked down. “Mother Confessor, are you all right?”Kahlan pulled a ragged breath. She was lying on her back in her bed, tangled inher blanket. It was twisted around between her legs.Maybe it was just a dream. She wished it was. She knew it wasn’t.Kahlan ran her fingers back into her hair as she sat up. “Cara-” It came out asa choking sob.Cara knelt on the ground beside her and gripped Kahlan’s shoulders. “What isit?”Kahlan struggled to get her breath.“What’s wrong? What can I do? Are you hurt? Are you sick?”“Oh, Cara . . . he’s been with Nicci.”Cara held her at arms length, her face a picture of concern.“What are you talking about? Who’s been-”Her words cut off when she realized what Kahlan meant.Kahlan struggled against Cara’s grip. “How could he-”“She no doubt made him,” Cara insisted. “He must have done it to save your life.She would have had to threaten him.”Kahlan was shaking her head. “No, no. He was enjoying it too much. He was likean animal. He never took me like that. He never acted . . . Oh, Cara, he’sfallen for her. He couldn’t resist her any longer. He’s-”Cara shook her until Kahlan thought her teeth would come loose.“Wake up! Open your eyes. Mother Confessor, wake up. You’re half asleep. You’restill half dreaming.”Kahlan blinked as she looked around. She was panting, still getting her breath.She had stopped crying.Cara was right. It had happened, there was no doubt in Kahlan’s mind, but it hadhappened when she was sleeping, and in her sleep, it had taken her unaware. Shehadn’t reacted rationally.“You’re right,” Kahlan said in a voice hoarse from crying. Her nose was stuffedup so that she could only breath through her mouth.“Now,” Cara said in a calm voice, “tell me what happened.”When she felt her face go red, Kahlan wished for the darkness. How could shetell anyone what had happened? She wished Cara hadn’t heard her.“Well, through the link”-Kahlan swallowed-”I could sense that, that, well, thatRichard made love to Nicci.”Cara looked skeptical. “Did it feel like when, well, I mean, are you sure? Couldyou tell it was him?”Kahlan felt her face go a darker shade of red. “Not exactly, I guess. I don’tknow.” She covered her breasts. “I could feel his . . . his teeth on me. He wasbiting ..”Cara scratched her head, averting her gaze, unsure how to frame her question.Kahlan answered it for her.“Richard never hurt me like that.”“Oh. Well then, it wasn’t Richard.”“What do you mean it wasn’t Richard? It had to be Richard.”“Did it? Would Richard want to make love to Nicci?”“Cara-she could make him. Threaten him.”“Do you think Nicci is an honorable person?”Kahlan frowned. “Nicci? Are you out of your mind?”“There you go, then. Why must it be Richard? Nicci may have simply found someman she had to have-some handsome farmboy. It could be nothing more than that.”“Really? You think so?”“You said it didn’t seem like Richard. I mean, you were half asleep, and in . .. shock. You said he never. . .”Kahlan looked away. “No, I suppose not.” She looked back at the Mord-Sith in thedim light. “I’m sorry, Cara. Thank you for being here with me. I’d not haveliked it if it had been Zedd, or someone else. Thank you.”Cara smiled. “I think we’d best keep this between the two of us.”Kahlan nodded gratefully. “If Zedd ever started in asking all his detailedquestions about this, well, I’d die of embarrassment.”Kahlan realized then that Cara was wrapped in a blanket that was open in thefront enough to reveal that she was naked underneath. There was a dark mark onthe upper half of her breast. There were a few more, but faint. Kahlan had seenCara naked, and didn’t recall there being any such mark on her. In fact, exceptfor her scars, her body was exasperatingly perfect.Frowning, Kahlan gestured. “Cara, what’s that there?”Cara glanced down and then threw the blanket closed.“It’s, I mean, well, it’s . . . just a bruise.”A love bruise-from a man’s mouth.“Is Benjamin over there in your tent with you?”Cara got to her bare feet. “Mother Confessor, you are still half asleep andhaving dreams. Go back to sleep.”Kahlan smiled as she watched Cara leave. The smile faded as she lay back in herbed. In the quiet loneliness, her doubts crept back.She cupped her breasts. Her nipples throbbed and ached. As she moved on the beda little, she winced as she only then began to realize how much she hurt, andwhere.She couldn’t believe that, even in her sleep, a part of it had been . . . Shefelt her face reddening again. She felt an overwhelming sense of shame at whatshe had done.No. She had done nothing. She was only sensing something through her link toNicci. It wasn’t real. She hadn’t really experienced it-Nicci had. But Kahlansuffered the same injuries.As she had at various times, Kahlan still felt that connection to Nicci throughthe link, and an aching sort of caring about the woman. What had happened leftKahlan feeling saddened. She felt that Nicci had so desperately wanted . . .something.Kahlan slipped her hand down between her legs. She flinched in pain as shetouched herself. She brought her fingers up to the candlelight. They glistenedwith blood. There was a lot of blood.Despite the burning pain of being torn inside, the confused embarrassment, andthe shadow of shame, she most of all felt a sense of relief.She knew without doubt: Cara was right, it had not been Richard."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 52Ann peered among the stand of birch trees crowded in the deep shadows of cliffsfor which the place was named. The dense wood was thick with the trees, theirpeeling white bark covered with dark blotches making it disorienting anddifficult to make sense of anything. To become disoriented, here, and wanderinto the wrong place, uninvited, was the last mistake you would ever make.It had been in her youth that she’d last come here, to the Healers of Redcliff.She’d promised herself she would never return She’d promised the healers asmuch, too. In the nearly thousand years since, she hoped they had forgotten.Few people knew of the place, and even fewer ever came hero--with good reason.The term “healers” was an odd and highly misleading designation for such adangerous lot, yet it wasn’t entirely without merit. The Healers of Redcliffweren’t concerned with human ailments, but with the well-being of things thatmattered to them. And very odd things indeed mattered to them. To tell the truthof it, after all this time, she would be surprised to find them still inexistence.As much as she hoped their talents could help, and as desperately as she neededhelp, she hoped to find that the healers no longer stalked the Redcliff Wood.“Visitooor. . .” hissed a teasing voice from the dim shadows in the crags of thecliff off behind the trees.Ann stood still. Cold sweat dotted her brow. Among the confusion of lines andspots made by the trees, she could not make out what it was she saw move. Shedidn’t really need to see them. She had heard the voice. There were no otherslike theirs. She swallowed, and tried to sound composed.“Yes, I am a visitor. I’m glad to find you well.”“Only us few left,” the voice said, echoing among the rock walls. “The chiiiimestook most.”That was what Ann had feared . . . what she had hoped.“I’m sorry,” she lied.“Tried,” the voice said, moving through the trees. “Could not heal the chiiiimesaway.”She wondered if they could still heal at all, and how long they would last.“Comes sheeee for a healings?” teased a voice from the depths of the jaggedclefts to the other side.“Come to let you look,” she said, letting them know she had terms, too. It wouldnot be all their way.“Costssss, you know.”Ann nodded. “Yes, I know.”She had tried everything else. Nothing had worked. She had no other choice, atleast none she could think of. She was no longer sure if it mattered to her whathappened, if it mattered if she ever came out of the Redcliff Wood.She was no longer sure if she had ever done any real good in her entire life.“Well?” she asked into the shadowy silence.Something flashed back behind the trees, back in the shade under low rockledges, as if inviting her further along the path, deeper into the twistingcleft in the mountains. Rubbing her knuckles, which still ached from the burnslong healed, she followed the path, and the rustle of brush. Shortly, she cameto a small gap its the trees. Back through that gap, she could see the craggyopening of a cave.Eyes watched from that dark maw.“Comes sheeee in,” the voice hissed.In resignation, Ann let out a sigh as she stepped off the trail, and into aplace she had never forgotten, despite how much she had tried.--]----Kahlan’s hair whipped around, lashing at her face. She gathered it in a fistover the front of her armored shoulder as she made her way through the hecticcamp. Thunderstorms collided violently with the mountains at the east side ofthe valley, throwing off lightning, thunder, and intermittent sheets of rain.Sporadic gusts bent the trees, and their leaves shimmered as if trembling infright before the onslaught.Usually, the camp was relatively quiet so as not to give any unwantedinformation to the enemy. Now, the noise of camp breaking up was jarring bycontrast. The noise alone was enough to make her pulse race. If only that wereall.As Kahlan hurried through what to the untrained eye would look like massconfusion, Cara, in her red leather, shoved men out of the way to break a clearpath for the Mother Confessor. Kahlan knew better than to try to get theMord-Sith not to do it. At least it caused no harm. Most of the men, when theysaw Kahlan in her leather armor with a D’Haran sword at her hip and the hilt ofthe Sword of Truth sticking up over her shoulder, moved out of her way withoutCam’s help.Horses nearby reared as they were being harnessed to a wagon. Men shouted andcursed as they struggled to get the team under control. The horses bellowed inprotest. Other men ran through camp, leaping over fires and gear as they rushedto deliver messages. Men sprang out of the way as wagons sped along, splashingmud and water. A long column of lancers five men wide was already marching offinto the threatening gloom. Their supporting archers were scrambling to fall inwith them.The path to the lodge was set with stones so people heading for it would nothave to walk in the mud, though one still had to run the gauntlet of mosquitoes.Rain swept in just as Kahlan and Cara made the door. Zedd was there, with Adie,General Meiffert and several of his officers, Verna, and Warren. They were allloosely gathered around the table pulled to the center of the room. Half a dozenmaps lay atop one another on the table.The mood in the room was tense.“How long ago?” Kahlan asked without any greetings.“Just now,” General Meiffert said. “They’re taking their time striking camp.They’re not organizing for an attack. They’re simply forming up to move out.”Kahlan rubbed her fingertips against her brow. “Any word on the direction?”The general shifted his posture, betraying his frustration. “The scouts say thatby all indications they’re going north, but nothing more specific than that,yet.”“They aren’t coming after us?”“They could always change course, or send an army over here, but right now, itappears they aren’t interested in coming in here after us.”“Jagang doesn’t need to come after us,” Warren said. Kahlan thought he looked alittle pale. Small wonder. She imagined they were all a little pale. “Jagang hasto know we are going to come at him: He’s not going to bother coming in hereafter us.”Kahlan couldn’t dispute his logic. “If he goes north, he has to know we’re notgoing to sit here and wave good-bye.”The emperor had changed his tactics-again. Kahlan had never seen a commanderlike him. Most military men had their preferred methods. If they had once won abattle in a certain way, they would suffer a dozen losses with the same tactics,thinking it had to work because it once had. Some were limited by theirintellect. Those were easy enough to read; they usually waged an artlesscampaign, content to throw men into a meat grinder, hoping to clog it with sheernumbers. Some leaders were clever, inventing tactics as they went. Those oftenthought too much of themselves and ended up on the point of a simple pike.Others slavishly went about using textbook tactics, thinking of war as a kind ofgame, and that each side should oblige the other by following rules.Jagang was different. He learned to read his enemy. He held to no favoredmethod. After Kahlan had hit him with quick limited attacks driven into thecenter of his camp, he learned the tactic and, instead of relying on hisoverpowering numbers, sent the same kind of attack back at the D’Haran army togood effect. Some men could be driven to making foolish mistakes by shamingthem. Jagang didn’t make the same mistake twice. He reined in his pride andchanged his tactics again, not obliging Kahlan with foolhardy counterattacks.The D’Harans had still managed to carve him up. They had taken out ImperialOrder troops in unprecedented numbers. Their own losses, while painful, wereremarkably low considering what they had accomplished.Winter, though, had killed far more of the enemy than anything Kahlan and hermen could conceive. The Imperial Order, being from far to the south, wasunfamiliar with and ill prepared for winter in the New World. Well over half amillion men had frozen to death. Several hundred thousand more had succumbed tofevers and sickness from the harsh life in the field.The winter alone had cost Jagang nearly three-quarters of a million men. It wasalmost beyond comprehension.Kahlan now commanded roughly three hundred thousand troops in the southernreaches of the Midlands. Under ordinary circumstances, that would be a forcecapable of crushing any enemy.The men streaming up from the Old World had replaced the enemy losses severaltimes over. Jagang’s army was now well over two and a half million men. It grewby the day.Jagang had been content to sit tight for the winter. Fighting in such conditionswas, for the most part, impossible. He had wisely waited out the weather. Whenspring had come, he still sat. Apparently, he was smart enough to know thatwarfare in spring mud was a deadly undertaking. In the muddy season, you couldlose your supply wagons if they got strung out. Streams became impassablefloods. Losing wagons was a slow death by starvation. Cavalry were next touseless in the mud. Losses to falls in a cavalry charge cost valuable mounts, tosay nothing of the men. Soldiers could make an attack, of course, but withoutsupporting services, it was likely to be a bloodbath for no real gain.Jagang had sat out the spring mud. His minions had used the time to spread theword about “Jagang the Just.” Kahlan was infuriated when she got reports, weeksafter the fact, about “envoys of peace” who had shown up in various citiesthroughout the Midlands, giving speeches about bringing the world together forthe good of all mankind. They promised piece and prosperity, if they werewelcomed into cities.Now, with summer finally upon them, Jagang was beginning his campaign anew. Heplanned his troops to now visit those cities his envoys had been to.The door burst open. It was not the wind, but Rikka. The Mord-Sith looked likeshe hadn’t slept in days.Cara went to her side, to be ready to offer assistance if requested, but didn’tdirectly lend a hand for support. A Mord-Sith did not look favorably upon helpin front of others.Rikka stepped up to the table, opposite Kahlan, and tossed two Agiel down atopthe map.Kahlan closed her eyes for a moment, then looked up into Rikka’s fierce blueeyes. “What happened?”“I don’t know, Mother Confessor. I found their heads impaled on pikes. TheirAgiel were tied to the pikes.”Kahlan held her anger in check. “Are you satisfied, now, Rikka?”“Galina and Solvig died as Mord-Sith would want to die.”“Galina and Solvig died for nothing, Rikka. After the first four, we knew itwouldn’t work. With the dream walker in their minds, the gifted are notvulnerable to Mord-Sith in the way that would otherwise be the case.”“It could have been something else. If we can catch their gifted where theMordSith can get at them, then we might be able to take them out. It’s worth therisk. Their gifted can cut down thousands of soldiers with a sweep of theirhand.”“I understand the wish, Rikka. Wishing, however, does not make it possible. Wehave six dead Mord-Sith to show us the reality of what is. We will not throwaway the lives of any more because we refuse to recognize the truth of it.”“I still think-”“Those of us here have important things to decide; I don’t have time for this.”Kahlan put her fists on the table and leaned toward the woman. “I am the MotherConfessor, and the wife to Lord Rahl. You will do as I say or you will leave. Doyou understand?”Rikka’s blue eyes shifted to Cara. Cara stood as expressive as a stone. Rikkalooked back at Kahlan and let out a long sigh.“I wish to remain with our forces and do my duty.”“Fine. Now, go get yourself something to eat while you still have a chance. Weneed you to be strong.”For a Mord-Sith, Rikka’s little nod was about as close to a salute as it came.After she was gone, Kahlan swatted at the plague of mosquitoes and returned herattention to the map.“So,” she said, removing the two Agiel from the map, “who has any suggestions?”“I’d say we have to keep at their edges,” Zedd offered. “Obviously, we can’t bethrowing ourselves in front of them. We can do nothing but to continue to fightthem as we have been doing.”“I agree,” Verna said.General Meiffert rubbed his chin as he stared down at the map spread out beforethem on the table. “What we have to worry about is his size.”“Well, of course we have to worry about the size of the Order,;’ Kahlan said.“They have enough men to split up and still be too huge to handle. That’s whatI’m talking about-what we’re going to do when he splits. If I were him, that’swhat I’d do. He knows how it would complicate our lives.”There was an urgent knock. Warren, over by the window, not bothering to look atthe map with the rest of them, opened the door.Captain Zimmer stepped in, giving a quick salute of his fist to his heart.Panting as he entered, he brought with him a swirling rush of warm air thatsmelled like a horse. Ignoring the rest of them, Warren returned to his broodingat the window.“He’s splitting his force,” Captain Zimmer announced, as if their fear had givenbirth to the reality.Most in the room sighed unhappily with the news.“Any direction, yet?” Kahlan asked.Captain Zimmer nodded. “From the looks of it, he’s sending maybe a third,possibly a little more, up the Callisidrin Valley toward Galea. The main forceis heading to the northeast, probably to enter and go north up the Kern Valley.”They all knew the eventual goal.Zedd made a fist. “There’s no joy in being right, but that’s just what Kahlanand I talked about. That was our guess.”General Meiffert was still rubbing his chin as he studied the map. “It’s anobvious move, but with the size of his force the obvious is not a liability.”No one wanted to broach the issue, so Kahlan settled the matter. “Galea is onits own. We’re not sending any troops to help them.”Captain Zimmer finally waggled a finger at the map. “We need to put our forcesin front of their main force to slow them down. If we stay on their heelsinstead, we will only be cleaning up the mess they make.”“I’d have to agree.” The general shifted his weight to his other foot. “We haveno choice but to try to slow them. We’ll have to keep giving ground, but atleast we can slow them. Otherwise, they are going to move up through the centerof the Midlands with the speed and power of a spring flood.”Zedd was watching the young wizard off by himself at the window. “Warren, whatdo you think?”Warren looked up at the sound of his name, as if he hadn’t been payingattention. Something about him didn’t look well. He took a breath andstraightened, his face brightening, making Kahlan think she had been mistaken.Hands clasped behind his back, Warren strode to the table.He peered at the map from over Verna’s shoulder. “Forget Galea-it’s a lostcause. We cannot help them. They will suffer the sentence imposed upon them bythe Mother Confessor-not because she spoke the words, but because her words weresimple truth. Any troops we sent to help would be forfeit.”Zedd cast a sidelong glance at his fellow wizard. “What else?”Warren finally moved closer to the table, wedging himself between Verna and thegeneral. With authority, he firmly planted his finger on the map, far to thenorthalmost three-quarters of the way to Aydindril from where they were camped.“You have to go there.”General Meiffert frowned. “Up there? Why?”“Because,” Warren said, “you can’t stop Jagang’s army-his main force. You canonly hope to slow them as they move north, up into the Kern Valley. This iswhere you must make a stand, if you hope to delay them next winter. Once theymove through you, they will be upon Aydindril.”“Move through us?” General Meiffert asked in an surly manner.Warren looked up at him. “Well, do you suppose you are going to be able to stopthem? It wouldn’t surprise me if by then they have three and a half to fourmillion men.”The general let out an ill-tempered breath. “Then why do you think we should beat that spot-right in their way?”“You can’t stop them, but if you harry them sufficiently as they move north, youcan keep them from reaching Aydindril this year. At this spot, they will berunning out of time before the weather closes in. With a bit of stiffresistance, you can grind them to a halt for the winter, buying Aydindril onemore season of freedom.”Warren looked up into Kahlan’s eyes. “The following summer, a year from now,Aydindril will fall. Prepare them for it in whatever way you are able, but makeno mistake: the city will fall to the Order.”Kahlan’s blood ran cold. To hear him say the words aloud staggered her. Shewanted to slap him.To contemplate the Imperial Order taking their attack into the heart of theMidlands was horrifying. To accept, as foreordained, the Imperial Order seizingthe heart of the New World was unthinkable. Kahlan’s mental image of Jagang andhis bloodthirsty thugs strolling the halls of the Confessors’ Palace sickenedher.Warren leaned around the general to look at Zedd. “The Wizard’s Keep must beprotected-you know that better than I. It would be the end of all hope if theirgifted were to gain the Keep and the dangerous things of magic stored there. Ithink the time has come to keep that above all else in our thinking. Holding theKeep is vital.”Zedd smoothed back his unruly white hair. “I could hold the Keep by myself, if Ihad to.”Warren looked away from Zedd’s hazel eyes. “You may have to,” he said in a quietvoice. “When we get to this place”-he tapped the map again-”then you can do nomore with the army, Zedd, and you must go to safeguard the Wizard’s Keep and thethings of magic kept there.”Kahlan could feel the blood heating her face. “You’re talking about this as ifit’s all settled-as if it has been decided by fate and there is nothing we cando about it. We can’t win if we hold such a defeatist attitude.”Warren smiled, his shy manner suddenly surfacing. “I’m sorry, Mother Confessor.I didn’t mean to give you that impression. I am only offering my analysis of thefacts of the situation. We aren’t going to be able to stop them-there’s no usedeluding ourselves about that. They grow larger by the day. We must also takeinto account that there are going to be lands, such as Anderith and Galea, whichfear the Order and will join them rather than suffer the brutal fate of thosewho refuse to surrender.“I lived in the Old World as it fell, bit by bit, to the Imperial Order. I’vestudied Jagang’s methods. I know the man’s patience. He methodically conqueredthe entire Old World when such a feat seemed inconceivable. He spent yearsbuilding roads just to be able to accomplish his plans. He never wavers from hisgoal. There are times when you can anger or humiliate him into a rash action,but he quickly comes to his senses.“He quickly comes to his senses because he has a cause that is paramount tohim.”“You must understand something important about Jagang. It’s the most importantthing I can tell you about the man: he believes with all his heart that what heis doing is right. He revels in the glory of conquest and victory, to be sure,but his deepest pleasure is being the one who has brought what he sees asrighteousness to those he views as heathens. He believes that mankind can onlyadvance, ethically, if they are all brought under the moral authority of theOrder.”“That’s just nonsense,” Kahlan said.“You may think so, but he truly believes he is serving the cause of the greatergood for mankind. He believes piously in this. It is a sacred moral truth to himand his ilk.”“He believes that murder, rape, and enslavement are just?” General Meiffertasked. “He would have to be out of his mind.”“He was raised at the feet of priests of the Fellowship of Order.” Warren lifteda finger to make sure they all noted his point. “He believes that all thosethings and more are justified. He believes that only the next world matters,because then we will be in the eternal Light of the Creator. The Order believesthat you earn that reward in the next world by sacrificing for your fellow manin this world. All those who refuse to see this-that would be us-must either bebrought to follow the Order’s ways, or die.”“So,” General Meiffert said, “it’s his sacred duty to crush us. It’s not plunderhe seeks, primarily, but his bizarre version of the salvation of mankind.”“Exactly.”“All right,” Kahlan said with a sigh. “So, what do you think this holy man ofjustice will do?”“He basically has two choices, I believe. If he is to conquer the New World andbring all of mankind under the authority of the Order, he must take twoimportant places, or he has not really succeeded: Aydindril, because it is theseat of power in the Midlands, and the People’s Palace in D’Hara, because itreigns over the D’Haran people. If those two fall, everything else will crumble.He could have gone for either. Emperor Jagang has now made his choice of whichfalls first.“The Imperial Order is going for Aydindril in order to split the Midlands. Whyelse would they go north? What better way to defeat an enemy than to cleave themin two? After they have Aydindril, they will turn their swords to an isolatedD’Hara. What better way to demoralize an enemy than to first go for their heart?“I am not saying that it is preordained, but merely telling you the way theOrder goes about its grisly work. This is the same thing Richard has alreadyfigured out. Given that we can’t realistically expect to stop them, I think itonly wise to face the reality of what is, don’t you?”Kahlan’s gaze sank to the map. “I believe that in the darkest hours we mustbelieve in ourselves. I do not intend to surrender the D’Haran Empire to theImperial Order. We need to wage the best war we can until we can turn itaround.”“The Mother Confessor is right,” Zedd insisted with quiet authority. “The lastgreat war I fought, in my youth, seemed just as hopeless for a time. Weprevailed, and drove the invaders back to the place from where they had come.”None of the D’Haran officers said anything. It was D’Hara that was that invader.“But things are different, now. That was a war pressed by an evil leader.” Zeddmet the gaze of General Meiffert, Captain Zimmer, and the other D’Haranofficers. “Every side in a war has good people, just as they all have the bad.Richard, as the new Lord Rahl, has given those good people a chance to flourish.“We must prevail in this. As difficult as it may now be to believe, there aregood people in the Old World, too, who would not wish to be under the boot heelof the Order, or to press a war for the Order’s reasons. Nonetheless, we muststop them.”“So,” Kahlan said, gesturing at the map before Warren, “how do you think Jagangwill press the war?”Warren tapped the map again, to the south of Aydindril. “Knowing Jagang and theway he conquers his opponents, I think he will stick to his grand plan. He has agoal and will doggedly continue to move toward it. There is nothing we haveshown him that he has not seen from other opponents for his whole life. Withthat experience, I’m sure he finds this war unexceptional. I don’t mean todiscount our efforts-all war has its surprises, and we’ve given him some nastyones. I would say, though, that it is going largely as he expected.“It will take them the summer to advance to this place I’ve shown you, given hisusual pace and the fact that you will be harrying them. Jagang, in general, hasalways moved slowly, but with unstoppable force. He will simply pour in enoughmen to crush the opposition. He feels that if he takes time to get to his enemy,it only gives them more time to tremble in fear of him. When he finally arrives,his enemies are often ready to crumble from the agony of the wait.“If you put your force there, where I showed you, you will be able to protectAydindril next winter, as Jagang will be content to bide his time. He haslearned what a hardship the winters are in the New World. He will not needlesslypress a winter campaign. But in the summer, when they move again, like they donow, then Aydindril will fall-whether or not you stand against the weight oftheir main force. When they move on Aydindril, we must hold the Wizard’s Keep.That is all we can do.”The room was silent. The fire was cold, now. Warren and Verna had already packedtheir things and were ready to go, as was most of the rest of the army. Warrenand Verna were losing their home. Kahlan glanced to the side, letting her gazelinger on the curtains she had long ago made for them. Their wedding seemed buta dim memory.Her own wedding seemed but a distant dream. Every time she woke, Richard seemedalmost a ghost to her. Mind-numbing, relentless, never-ending war seemed theonly reality. There were occasional fleeting moments when she thought that shemight have only dreamed him, that he couldn’t possibly have really existed, thattheir long-ago happy summer home in the mountains never happened. Those momentsof doubt terrified her more than Jagang’s army.“Warren,” Kahlan asked in a soft voice, “what then? What do you think willhappen the following summer, after they have taken Aydindril?”Warren shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe Jagang will be content to digest Aydindrilfor a while, to establish firm control over the Midlands. He believes it hisduty to his Creator to bring all of mankind under the Order. Sooner or later, hewill move on D’Hara.”Kahlan finally directed her attention to Captain Zimmer.“Captain, get your men ready. While we’re getting all our supplies and such onthe way, you might as well go and remind Jagang that we have kept our bladessharp.”The captain grinned and clapped his fist to his heart.Kahlan swept her gaze across everyone in the room.“I intend to make the Order shed blood for every inch they take. If that is allI can do, then I will do it until I breathe my last breath.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 53The dead-still air was sweltering and reeked of stagnant sewage. Richard wipedsweat from his brow. At least as long as his sturdy wagon was rolling throughthe streets he could enjoy a little breeze.Distracted out of his concern over knowing Kahlan and Cara had to have longsince left the safety of their mountain home, he noticed an unusual amount ofactivity for the middle of the night. Shadowy figures hurried down the darkstreets to dart into dim buildings. Slashes of light briefly fell to the streetuntil doors could be pulled shut. The moon was out, and in the darker alleys hethought he saw people watching him, waiting until he passed before they went ontheir way. Over the rumble of his wagon’s wheels he couldn’t hear anything theymight be saying.As he turned onto the road that would take him out to the charcoal maker, he hadto pull his team up short as men with long pole weapons stepped out and blockedhis way. A guard seized the horses’ bits. Other of the city guard swept out ofthe side street to point lances up at him.“What are you doing out here?” one of the voices asked from the side of thewagon.Richard calmly yanked up on the lever to set the brake.“I have a special pass to move goods at night. It’s for the emperor’s palace.”The words “emperor’s palace” were usually enough to have him on his way.The guard waggled his fingers. “If you have a special pass, then let’s see it.”This night, the guards wanted more. Richard pulled a folded piece of paper froma protective leather sleeve inside his shirt and held it down to the guard.Metal squeaked as the guard slid open a tiny door on his shielded lantern,letting a narrow slit of light fall across the paper. Several heads bent in toread the words and inspect the official seals. They were all genuine. Theyshould be-they had cost Richard a small fortune.“Here you go.” The guard handed the paper back to Richard. “Have you seenanything unusual as you have gone through the city?”“Unusual? What do you mean?”The guard grunted. “If you had seen anything, you wouldn’t have to ask.” Hewaved his hand. “On your way.”Richard made no effort to leave. “Should I be worried?” He made a show oflooking around. “Are there highwaymen about? Am I in danger? Is it safe for acitizen to be out? I’ll take the wagon back if it’s dangerous.”The man chuckled derisively. “You’ve got nothing to be afraid of. It’s just somefoolish people making trouble because they’ve nothing better to do.”“That’s all it is? Are you sure?”“You have work to do for the palace. Get to it.”“Yes, sir.” Richard clicked his tongue and flicked the reins. The heavy wagonlurched ahead.He didn’t know what was going on, but suspected the guards were out to catchsome more insurgents for questioning. They probably wanted to get back to theirpost, so anyone they got their hands on was likely to end up being an insurgent.A man from Ishaq’s place had been arrested several days before. He had beendrunk on homemade liquor and left a meeting early. He never made it home. A fewdays later, Ishaq had received word that the man had confessed to crimes againstthe Order. The man’s wife and daughter were arrested. The wife was releasedafter receiving a specified number of lashes for confessing to speaking ill ofthe Order and having hateful thoughts about her neighbors. The daughter had notyet been released. No one even knew where she was being held.Eventually he reached the edge of the city where it gave way to open fields.Richard took a deep breath of the agreeable aroma of freshly turned earth.Lights from occasional farms glimmered like lonely stars. In the moonlightRichard could finally see the rough skyline of forest. As he rolled into thecharcoal maker’s place, the charcoal maker, a nervous man named Faval, scurriedup to the side of the wagon.“Richard Cypher! There you are. I was worried about you coming.”“Why?”The man let out a high-pitched titter. Faval frequently giggled at things thatweren’t funny. Richard understood that it was just his way. He was a jumpyfellow and his laugh was not meant as disrespect, but was rather something hecouldn’t help. A lot of people, though, avoided Faval because of his strangelaugh, fearing he might be crazy-a punishment, they believed, imposed on sinnersby the Creator. Others got angry at him because they thought he was laughing atthem. That only made Faval more nervous, which made him laugh all the more.Faval was missing his front teeth and his nose was crooked from being broken anumber of times. Richard knew the man couldn’t really help it, and so never gavehim trouble about it. Faval had taken a liking to him.“I don’t know, I just thought you might not come.”Faval’s big eyes blinked in the moonlight. Richard’s face wrinkled in apuzzlement.“Faval, I said I was coming. Why would you think I might not?”Faval’s fingers worried at his earlobe. “No reason.”Richard climbed down. “The city guards stopped me-”“No!” Faval’s titter rippled out through the darkness. “What did they want? Didthey ask you anything?”“They wanted to know if I’d seen anything unusual.”“But you didn’t.” He giggled. “They let you go. You saw nothing.”“Well,” Richard drawled, “I did see that fellow with the two heads.”Crickets chirped in the silence. Faval blinked in astonishment. In themoonlight, Richard could see his mouth hanging open.“You saw a man with two heads?”This time, it was Richard who laughed. “No, Faval, I didn’t. It was just ajoke.”“It was? But it wasn’t funny.”Richard sighed. “I suppose not. Have you got the load of charcoal ready? I’vegot a long night ahead of me. Victor needs a load of steel, and Priska needscharcoal or he said he would have to close down. He said you didn’t send yourlast order.”Faval giggled. “I couldn’t! I wanted to, Richard Cypher. I need the money. I owethe loggers for the trees I made into this charcoal. They told me they weregoing to quit bringing me wood if I didn’t pay them.”Faval lived at the edge of a forest, so his source of wood was handy, but hewasn’t allowed to cut the wood. All resources belonged to the Order. Trees werecut when the loggers, who had permits, needed work, not when someone neededwood. Most of the wood lay on the ground and rotted. Anyone caught picking upwood was liable to be arrested for stealing from the Order.Faval held his hands up as if to implore Richard’s understanding. “I tried toget the charcoal transported to Priska, but the committee denied me permissionto transport it. They said I don’t need the money. Don’t need the money! Can youimagine?” He laughed painfully. “They told me that I was a rich man, because Ihad a business, and that I had to wait while they saw to the needs of the commonpeople, first. I am only trying to live.”“I know, Faval. I told Priska that it wasn’t your fault. He understands-he hastroubles like that of his own. He’s just desperate because he needs thecharcoal. You know Priska; he gets hot at those who have nothing to do with theproblem. I told him I would bring a load of charcoal tonight, and another twotomorrow night. Can I count on you for two more loads tomorrow?”Richard held out the silver coins for the load of charcoal.Faval clapped his hands together prayerfully. “Oh, thank you, Richard Cypher.You are a savior. Those loggers are a nasty lot. Yes, yes, and two tomorrow. Ihave them cooling now. You are as good as a ,son to me, Richard Cypher.” Hemotioned off into the darkness as he tittered. “They are there, cooking. Youwill have them.”Richard could see the dozens and dozens of mounds, like little haystacks, thatwere the earthen ovens. Small pieces of split wood were tightly stacked aroundin a circle, with tinder stuffed in the center, building them up into a roundedpile which was then covered over with fern leaves and broom and then plasteredover with firm earth. Fire was put in at the bottom, then that opening wasclosed over. Moisture and smoke escaped from small vents in the top for six toeight days. When the smoke ceased, the vents were sealed to kill the fire. Afterit cooled, the earthen ovens could be opened and the charcoal removed. It was alabor-intensive occupation, but rather simple work.“Let me help you load your wagon,” Faval said.Richard caught the man’s shirt at his shoulder as he started away. “Faval,what’s going on?”Faval put a finger to his lower lip as he laughed. It almost sounded like it waspainful for him to laugh. He hesitated, but finally whispered his answer.“The revolt. It has started.”Richard had suspected as much. “What do you know about it, Faval?”“Nothing! I know nothing!”“Faval, it’s me, Richard. I’m not going to turn you in.”Faval laughed. This time it sounded more like relief. “Of course not. Of coursenot. Forgive me, Richard Cypher. I get so nervous, I wasn’t thinking.”“So, what about this revolt?”Faval turned up his hands in a helpless gesture. “The Order, they stranglepeople. We can’t live. If not for you, Richard Cypher, I would be . . . well, Idon’t want to think about it. But others, they are not so fortunate. Theystarve. The Order takes the food they grow. People have loved ones who have beenarrested. They confess to things they did not do.“Did you know that, Richard Cypher? That they confess to things they did not do?I never believed it myself I thought that if they confessed, then they wereguilty. Why confess if you are innocent?” He giggled. “Why? I thought they wereterrible people wanting to hurt the Order. I thought it served them right, and Iwas glad they were arrested and punished.”“So what changed your mind?”“My brother.” Faval’s chuckles suddenly were sobs. “He helped me make charcoal.We made it together. We supported our families making charcoal. We worked fromsunup until sundown. We slept in the same house, there. That one there. Oneroom. We were together all the time.“Last year, at a meeting where we all had to stand up and tell how the Ordermade our lives better, as we were leaving, they arrested him. Someone gave hisname as maybe an insurgent. I was not worried. My brother was not guilty ofanything. He makes charcoal.”Richard waited in the darkness, sweat trickling down his neck, as Faval staredoff into the dark visions.“For a week, I went every day to the barracks to tell them that he would not doanything against the Order. We loved the Order. The Order wishes all people tobe fed and cared for.“The guards said my brother finally confessed. High crimes, they called itplotting to overthrow the Order. They said he confessed it to them.“The next day, I was going to go to see more people, the officials at thebarracks-I was so angry-to tell them that they were cruel animals. My wife, shecried and begged me not to go back to the barracks yet again, for fear theywould arrest me, too. For her sake, and the children, I did not go. It would dono good, anyway. They had my brother’s confession. No one who confesses isinnocent. Everyone knows that.“They put my brother to death. His wife and children live with us, still. We canhardly. . .” Faval giggled as he bit down on his knuckle.Richard put a hand on the man’s shoulder. “I understand, Faval. There wasnothing you could have done.”Faval wiped at his eyes. “Now I am guilty of thinking hateful thoughts. That isa crime, you know. I am guilty of it. I think about life without the Order. Idream of having a cart of my own just a cart-and my sons and nephew coulddeliver the charcoal we make. Wouldn’t that be wonderful, Richard Cypher? Icould buy. . .” His voice trailed off.He looked up in confusion. “But the Order says such thoughts are a crime becauseI am putting my wants before the needs of others. Why are their needs moreimportant than mine? Why?“I went to ask for a permit to buy a cart. They say I cannot have one because itwould put the cart drivers out of work. They said I was greedy for wanting toput people out of work. They called me selfish for having such thoughts.”“That’s wrong,” Richard said in quiet assurance. “Your thoughts are not a crime,nor are they evil. It’s your life, Faval-you should be able to live it as yousee fit. You should be able to buy your cart and work hard and make the best ofyour life for you and your family.”Faval chortled. “You sound like a revolutionary, Richard Cypher.”Richard sighed, thinking about how useless the whole thing was. “No, Faval.”Faval appraised him in the moonlight for a time. “It has already started,Richard Cypher. The revolt. It has begun.”“I have charcoal to deliver.” Richard went around the back of the wagon andhoisted a basket up onto the wagon bed.Faval helped with the next basket. “You should join them, Richard Cypher. Youare a smart man. They could use your help.”“Why?” Richard wondered if he dared get his hopes up. “What do they haveplanned? What are they going to do with this revolt?”Faval giggled. “Why, they are marching in the streets, tomorrow. They are goingto demand changes.”“What changes?”“Well, I think they want to be able to work. They are going to demand they beallowed to do what they want.” He giggled. “Maybe, I can get a cart? Do youthink, Richard Cypher? Do you think that when they have this revolt I can get acart and deliver my charcoal? I could make more charcoal, then.”“But what do they plan to do? How are they going to change anything if the Ordersays no?-Which they will.”“Do? Why, I think they will be very angry if the Order tells them no. They maynot go back to their jobs. Some say they will break into the stores and take thebread.”Richard’s hopes faded back into the shadows.The man clutched at Richard’s sleeve. “What should I do, Richard Cypher? ShouldI join the revolt? Tell me.”“Faval, you should not ask anyone else what you should do about something likethis. How can you endanger your life, the lives of your family, on what a manwith a wagon says?”“But you are a smart man, Richard Cypher. I am not so smart as you.”Richard tapped his finger against the man’s forehead. “Faval, in here, in yourhead, you are smart enough to know what you must do. You have already told mewhy the Order can never help people have better lives by telling them how theymust live. You figured that out all on your own. You, Faval the charcoal maker,are smarter than the Order.”Faval beamed. “You think so, Richard Cypher? No one ever told me before that Iwas smart.”“You’re smart enough to decide for yourself how much it means to you and whatyou want to do about it.”“I fear for my wife, and my brother’s wife, and all our children. I don’t wantthe Order, but I’m afraid for them if I am arrested. How would they live?”Richard heaved another basket into the wagon. “Faval, listen to me. Revolt isthe kind of thing you must be sure of. It’s dangerous business. If you are goingto join a revolt, you have to be sure enough of what you want to do to be readyto lay down your life for your freedom.”“Really? You think so, Richard Cypher?”The spark of hope was gone.“Faval, you stay here and make charcoal. Priska needs charcoal. The Order willarrest those people, and then that will be the end of it. You’re a good man. Idon’t want to see you arrested.”Faval grinned. “All right, Richard Cypher. If you say so, I will stay here andmake charcoal.”“Good. I’ll be back tomorrow night. But Faval, if there is still trouble, I maynot make it tomorrow night. If there is still marching going on and the streetsand roads are blocked, I may not be able to make it out here.”“I understand. You will be back as soon as you can. I trust you, Richard Cypher.You never let me down.”Richard smiled. “Look, if they are having a revolt tomorrow, and I can’t make itout here right away, here’s the money for the next load.” He handed the mananother silver mark. “I don’t want those loggers to stop getting wood for you.The foundries need charcoal.”Faval giggled in genuine delight. He kissed the silver mark and slipped it downhis boot. “The charcoal will be ready. Now, let me help you load your wagon.”Faval was only one of the charcoal makers with whom Richard dealt. He had awhole string of them he kept going so the foundries could have charcoal. Theywere all humble people just trying to get along in life. They did the best theycould under the yoke of the Order.Richard made a little profit selling the charcoal to the foundries, but he mademore selling iron and steel he bought from them. Charcoal was just a smallsideline to help fill his nights, as long as he was out with his wagon. What hemade from the charcoal covered the bribes, mostly. He made a good bit morehauling the odd load of ore, clay, lead, quicksilver, antimony, salt, moldingpowders, and a variety of other things the foundries needed but couldn’t getpermits for or get transported when they needed them. There was as much of thatbusiness as Richard could want. It paid for the care of his team with someprofit left over. The iron and steel was pure profit.By the time he made it to the foundry with the load of charcoal, Priska, thehulking foundry master, was pacing. His powerful hands grabbed the side of thewagon. He peered in.“About time.”“I had to wait for an hour after I came from Faval’s while the city guardsinspected the load.”Priska waved his beefy arms. “Those bastards!”“It’s all right-calm down. They didn’t take any. I have it all.”The man sighed. “I tell you, Richard, it’s a wonder I’ve kept my furnacesgoing.”Richard ventured a dangerous question. “You’re not involved with the . . .trouble, in the city, are you?”In the light coming from his office window-really no more than a hut-Priskaappraised Richard for a time. “Richard, change is coming. Change for thebetter.”“What change?”“A revolt has begun.”Richard felt the spark of hope grow anew, but stronger this time-not so much forhimself, his chains held him too tenaciously, but for the people who yearned tobe free. Faval was a kind man, a hardworking man, but he was not the clever man,the resourceful man, that Priska was. Priska was a man who knew more than itwould seem possible for him to know. Priska had given Richard the names of allthe officials who could be bribed for papers, and advised him how much to offer.“A revolt?” Richard asked “A revolt for what?”“For us-for the people who want to be able to live our lives as we wish. The newbeginning is starting. Tonight. In fact, it has already begun.” He turned to hisbuilding and pulled open the doors. “When you get to Victor’s, you must wait forhim, Richard. He must speak with you.”“About what?”Priska waved dismissively. “Come, give me my charcoal and then load your steel.Victor will bite my head off if I keep you.”Richard pulled the first basket out of the wagon and carried it to the side,where Priska added another.“What have these people who starting the revolt done? What are their plans?”Priska leaned close as Richard dragged another basket to the rear of the wagon.“They have captured a number of officials of the Order. High officials.”“Have they killed them, yet?”“Killed them! Are you crazy? They aren’t going to harm them. They will be helduntil they agree to loosen the rules, satisfy the demands of the people.”Richard gaped at the man. “Loosen the rules? What are they demanding?”“Things must change. People want to be allowed more stay in their businesses,their lives, their work.” He lifted a basket of charcoal. “Less meetings. Theyare demanding to have their needs taken more into consideration.”This time, the spark of Richard’s hopes didn’t dim, rather, it plunged into icywaters.He didn’t much pay attention to Priska as they unloaded the wagon and thenloaded the steel. He didn’t really want to listen to the plans for the revolt.He couldn’t help getting the gist of it, anyway.The revolutionaries had it all figured out. They wanted public trials for thosepeople the Order arrested. They wanted to be allowed to see prisoners. Theywanted to have the Order give them a list of what had happened to a number ofpeople who had been arrested, but never heard from. There were other details anddemands but Richard’s mind wandered to other things.As Richard was climbing up into his wagon to leave, Priska seized his arm in airon grip. “The time has come, Richard, for men who care to join the revolt.”The two of them shared a long look. “Victor is waiting.”Priska released Richard’s arm and grinned. “So he is. I’ll see you later,Richard. Perhaps the next trip you make here will be after the Order meets thedemands, and you will be able to come in the day, without papers.”“That would be grand, Priska.”By the time he arrived at Victor’s, Richard had a headache. He felt sick overwhat he’d heard, and what he feared yet to hear.Victor was there, waiting for him. It was a little early, yet, for the man to bethere; usually, he didn’t arrive until closer to dawn. The blacksmith threw openthe doors to his outer stockroom. He set a lantern on a shelf so Richard couldsee to back his wagon close.Victor was wearing a wolfish grin as Richard climbed down.“Come, Richard, unload your wagon, then we will have some lardo, and talk.”Richard went methodically about his task, not really wanting to talk. He had agood idea what Victor wanted to talk about. Victor, as was his way, left Richardto unload. He was the man buying the steel, and enjoyed the service of having itdelivered where he wanted it. It was a service he could rarely get from atransport company, despite the higher price.Richard didn’t mind being left alone. Summer this far south in the Old World wasmiserable. The humidity was oppressive, with the nights rarely better than thedays.As he worked, he thought about the sparkling bright days spent with Kahlanbeside the brook at their mountain home. It seemed a lifetime ago. His hopes ofever seeing her again were difficult to keep alive, but his worry for her, nowthat summer was here, never ceased. Sometimes, it hurt so much to think abouther, to miss her, to worry, that he had to put her from his mind. At othertimes, thoughts of her were all that kept him going.By the time he had finished, the sky was tuning lighter. He found Victor in thefar room, the doors open wide so that dawn’s light lit Victor’s marble monolith.The blacksmith was gazing at the beauty in his stone, at the statue still insidethat only he saw.It was a long moment before he noticed Richard standing not far away.“Richard, come have lardo with me.”They sat on the threshold looking out over the site of the Retreat, watching themiles of stone walls tun pink in the hazy dawn. Even from the distance, Richardcould see along the top of one wall the vile figures representing the evil ofmankind.Victor handed Richard a pure white slice of lardo. “Richard, the revolt I toldyou about has started. But you probably already know that.”“No it hasn’t,” Richard said.Victor stared, dumbfounded. “But it has.”“A lot of trouble has started. It is not the revolt you and I spoke of.”“It will be. You will see. Many men will be marching today.” Victor gesturedexpansively. “Richard, we want you to lead us.”Richard had been expecting the question. “No.”“I know, I know, you think the men don’t know you, and they won’t follow you,but you are wrong, Richard. Many do know you. More than you think. I have toldmany of them about you. Priska and others have spoken of you. You can do it,Richard.”Richard stared out at the walls, at the carvings of cowering men.“No.”Victor was taken aback, this time. “But why not?”“Because a lot of men are going to die.”Victor chuckled. “No, Richard, no. You misunderstand. This will not be that kindof revolt. This will be a revolt of men of goodwill. This is a revolt for thebetterment of mankind. That is what the Order always preaches. We are thepeople. They say they are for the people, and now, when we put the demands ofthe people to them, they will have to listen and give in.”Richard shook his head sadly to himself.“You want me to lead you?”“Yes.”“Then I want you to do something for me, Victor.”“Of course, Richard. Name it.”“You stay far away from anything to do with this uprising. Those are my ordersto you as your leader. You stay here and work today. You stay out of it.”Victor looked as if he thought Richard might be making a joke. After a moment,he saw that Richard was not joking.“But why? Don’t you want things to get better? Do you wish to live like this allyour life? Don’t you want things to improve?”“Are you willing to kill those men of the Order that have been captured?”“Kill them? Richard, why do you want to talk about killing? This is about life.About things being better.”“Victor, listen to me. These men you go up against are not going to play by yourrules.”“But they will want-”“You stay here and work, or you will die along with a lot of other men. TheOrder will crush this uprising within a day or two, and then they will go aftereveryone they even suspect had a hand in it. A lot of people are going to die.”“But if you were-to lead us, you could present our demands. That is why we wantyou to lead us-to prevent that kind of trouble. You know how to convince people.You know how to get things done-just look at how you help all the people inAltur’Rang: Faval, Priska, me, and all the others. We need you, Richard. We needyou to give people a reason to follow the revolt.”“If they don’t know what they stand for and what they want, then no one can givethem a reason. They will only.succeed when they burn for freedom, and are notonly willing to kill for it, but to die for it.” Richard stood and brushed thedirt from his pants. “Stay out of it, Victor, or you will die with them.”Victor followed him to his wagon. In the distance, men were arriving to work onthe emperor’s palace. The blacksmith picked at the wood on the wagon’s side,apparently wanting to say more.“Richard, I know how you feel. I really do. I, too, think these men are notburning with the kind of hunger for freedom that I have, but they are not fromCavatura, as I am, so perhaps they do not know what true freedom is, but fornow, this is all we can do. Won’t you give it a try, Richard?“Richard Rahl, of the D’Haran Empire to the north, understands our passion forfreedom, and would try.”Richard climbed up into his wagon seat. He wondered where people heard suchthings, and marveled at how the spark of such ideas could travel so far. Afterhe took up the reins and whip, Richard shared a long look with the soberblacksmith, a man intoxicated with the whiff of freedom in the air.“Victor, would you try to hammer cold steel into a tool?”“Of course not. The steel must be white-hot before it can become something.”“So must men, Victor. These men are cold steel. Spare your hammer. I’m sure thisRichard Rahl would tell you the same thing.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 54The uprising lasted a day. Richard stayed home. He asked Nicci to stay home,too. He told her that he’d heard rumors of possible trouble and said he didn’twant her to get hurt.The purge of the insurrectionists by the Order, on the other hand, lasted aweek. Men who had participated in the marching had been slaughtered in thestreets, or captured by the city guard. Those who were captured were questioneduntil they eventually confessed the names of others. People questioned by theOrder always confessed.The ripples of arrest, confession, and further arrest spread through the cityand went on for days. Hundreds of men were buried in the sky. Eventually, thefires of unrest were snuffed out. The ash of regret covered every tongue aspeople wanted to forget the whole thing. The marches were rarely even mentioned,as if it had never happened.Richard finally went back to work at the transport company, rather than riskhaving his wagon out at night. Jori had nothing to say as they rolled throughthe city, past the poles holding up rotting corpses buried in the sky.Jori and Richard made trips out to the mines to pick up ore for the foundries.They made one trip to a sandstone quarry a little ways to the east of the city.That took the whole day there and back. The next day they delivered the stone tothe west side of Retreat, where it was needed for a buttress. There were anumber of poles, maybe fifty or sixty, on the other side of the walls, over nearthe carving area. Apparently, some of the workers had been purged, too.On the way out, they went up the road past the blacksmith’s shop. Richard jumpeddown off the wagon and told Jori that he would go up the hill and join him afterthe wagon made its way around the twists in the road. He said he had to reportto the blacksmith about their next delivery.Inside the dark workshop, Victor was hammering a long piece of steel, bendingthe red-hot metal over the horn of an anvil. He looked up and, when he saw itwas Richard, thrust the hot metal in the liquid beside this anvil, where itbubbled and hissed.“Richard! I’m glad to see you.”Richard noticed several of Victor’s men were missing. “Sick?”Victor grimly shook his head.Richard acknowledged the news with a single nod. “I’m glad to see you well,Victor. I just wanted to stop and make sure you were all right.”“Richard, I’m fine.” He hung his head. “Thanks to your advice. I could be buriedin the sky, now.” He gestured toward the Retreat. “Did you see? Many of thecarvers . . . all hanging from the poles down there.”Richard had seen the bodies, but hadn’t realized it was many of the stonecarvers. He knew how some had felt about the things they carved-how they hatedto create scenes of death.“Priska?”Victor gave a desolate shake of his head, too choked up to say it.“Faval?”“Saw him yesterday.” Victor took a purging breath. “He said you told him to stayhome and make charcoal. I think he is going to rename one of his children afteryou.”“If Priska . . . What about your special steel?”Victor gestured with the bar he held in tongs. “His head man is going to carryon. Can you make a run for iron? I haven’t had a supply since before thetrouble. Brother Narev is in a foul mood; he wants some iron supports for thepiers. He suggested that a blacksmith loyal to the Order and the Creator wouldget them made.”Richard nodded. “I think it’s calmed down enough. When?”“I could really use it now, but I can make do until the day after tomorrow. Ihave some of these fussy chisels to make, for the detail work, and I’m shortmen, so it can wait that long.”“Day after tomorrow, then. It should be safe enough by then.”The sun had set as Richard was walking up the street to his room with Nicci, butthe twilight let him see his way well enough. He was thinking about Victor whenhalf a dozen men stepped out from behind a building.“Richard Cypher?”They weren’t dressed like regular city guards, but that didn’t mean a whole lot,lately. There were a number of special men, not in uniform, who, it was said,hunted down troublemakers.“That’s right. What is it you wish?”He saw the men each had swords under their light capes. They each had a hand ona long knife at their belts.“As sworn officers of the Imperial Order, it is our duty to place you underarrest for suspicion of insurrection.”When Nicci woke, Richard still wasn’t home. She growled unhappily. She rolledonto her back and saw that light was coming in through the curtains. By theangle of the sunlight, it looked like it must be shortly past dawn.She yawned and stretched in her bed, letting her arms drop back as she stared atthe ceiling, the clean, whitewashed ceiling. She felt her anger building. It wasupsetting when he wasn’t there at night, but it made her feel a fraud if sheberated him for working so hard. Her intent had been to make him see how hardordinary people had to work to get along in life, to make him see how the Orderwas the only hope of improving the lives of the common people.She had warned him not to become involved in the recent uprising. She waspleased he didn’t try to argue with her about it. If anything, he seemed opposedto them. It surprised her that he had even stayed home from work while themarches took place. He warned Kamil and Nabbi, in the strongest terms, to keepaway from the insurrection.Now that the rebellion had been crushed, and the authorities had arrested manyof the troublemakers, it was safe again, so Richard had finally been able toreturn to work. The rebellion had been a shock. The Order needed to do more tomake people understand their duty to help make the lives of those less fortunatemore tolerable. Then there wouldn’t be any trouble in the streets. To that end,many of the officials had been purged for not doing enough to further the causeof the Order. At least there was that much good out of it.Nicci splashed water on her face from the basin Richard had brought home oneday. The flowers around the edges matched the salmon-colored walls, and the rughe had been able to purchase from savings. He was certainly industrious,managing to save from his meager wage.She pulled off her sweaty nightshirt and bathed herself as best she could with awet washcloth. It felt refreshing. She hated to look sweaty and dirty in frontof Richard.She saw that the bowl of stew she’d made for his dinner the night before wasstill sitting on the table. He hadn’t told her that he had to work at night, butsometimes he didn’t have time to come home for dinner first. When he worked atnight, he usually came home shortly after dawn, so she expected to see him atany moment.He would likely be hungry. Maybe she would make him eggs. Richard liked eggs.She realized she was smiling. She had been angry when she first woke, and now,thinking about what Richard liked, she was smiling. She combed her fingersthrough her hair, already eagerly looking forward to seeing him walk in, toasking if he would like her to make him eggs. He would say yes, and she wouldhave the pleasure of doing something she knew he wanted.She loathed doing things she knew he didn’t like.It had been several months since that awful night with Gadi. That had been amistake. She knew that afterward. At first, she had enjoyed it, not because shewanted to have sex with that repulsive thug, but because she had been sohumiliated by Richard refusing to make love to her that she wanted to get backat him. She had in the beginning of it reveled in what Gadi did to her, reveledin how he hurt her, because it was hurting Kahlan, too. Nicci enjoyed it only inthe sense that it was punishment for what he had done to her. Nothing hurtRichard like hurting Kahlan.Gadi hated Richard. Having Nicci, he thought, got back at Richard and made Gadia king again. As much as he wanted her, he wanted to get back at Richard more.Richard had taken Gadi’s kingdom and made it his own. Nicci was only too happyto let the little bully be king again. Every sincere cry, she knew, Richardheard, and would know that Kahlan felt the same pain.But as Gadi went at her with wild abandon, doing his best to degrade Richard bywhat he did to her, Richard’s words-”Nicci, please don’t do this. You’re onlyhurting yourself” began to haunt her.As Gadi took her, she tried to make believe it was Richard, tried to haveRichard if even by proxy. But she couldn’t make herself believe it, not even forthe pleasure of such a fantasy. Richard, she knew, would never humiliate andhurt a woman in that way. She couldn’t even pretend for a second that it wasRichard.More, though, Nicci began to comprehend that Richard’s words were not a plea tospare Kahlan pain, but to spare Nicci the pain. As much as he must hated her,Richard had expressed concern for her. As much as he must hated her, he didn’twant to see her hurt.Nothing else Richard could have said would have cut deeper into her heart. Thatkindness was the cruelest thing he could have done to her.The pain afterward was her punishment. Nicci was so ashamed of what she had donethat she pretended to Richard that she hadn’t suffered in the incident. Shewanted to spare him the distress of knowing what Kahlan was suffering along withher. The next morning, she told Richard that she had made a mistake. She didn’texpect his forgiveness; she wanted him to know she knew she had been wrong, andthat she was sorry.Richard said nothing; he only watched her with those gray eyes of his as helistened before leaving for work.She bled for three days.Gadi had bragged to his friends about having her. To her further humiliation, herevealed all the details. To Gadi’s surprise, Kamil and Nabbi had been furiousat him. They were intent on dripping hot wax in his eyes and doing some otherthings-what, Nicci wasn’t sure, but could imagine. The threat was so deadlyserious that Gadi had gone off and joined the Imperial Order army that very sameday. He had joined just in time to leave with a new troop on their way north tothe war. Gadi had sneered to Kamil and Nabbi that day, telling them that he wasgoing off to be a hero.Nicci heard footsteps coming down the hall. She smiled and pulled three eggs outof the cupboard. Instead of Richard opening the door, as she was expecting,someone knocked.Nicci stepped to the middle of the room. “Who is it?”“Nicci, it’s me, Kamil.”The urgency in his voice made the fine hairs on her arms stand on end.“I’m decent. Come in.”The young man burst in, panting. His face was white, as were his knuckles aroundthe doorknob. Tears stained his cheeks.“They’ve arrested Richard. Last night. They have him.”Nicci was only dimly aware of the eggs hitting the floor."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 55With Kamil at her side, Nicci ascended the dozen stone steps up into the cityguard barracks. It was a huge fortress, its high walls stretching off down theentire block. Nicci hadn’t asked Kamil to go with her. She doubted that anythingshort of death would have stopped him. She couldn’t really decipher preciselyhow Richard managed to inspire such reactions in people.As they had left, Nicci was in a state of frantic shock, but she had noticedthat the entire building of people seemed tense and alert. Faces peered fromwindows as she and Kamil had rushed out the building and down the road. Peoplehad come out of other buildings to watch her go. They all wore grim expressions.What was it that made people care so much about this one man?What was it that made her care?The inside of the filthy barracks was crowded with people. Hollow-cheeked,unshaven, old men stood as if in a daze, staring off at nothing. Plump-cheekedwomen with scarves covering their heads wept as wailing children clung to theirskirts. Other women stood around without expression, as if they were expectingto buy bread or millet. One small child, with only a shirt and nothing from thewaist down, stood forlorn, his tiny fists at his mouth as he bawled.The room felt like a death watch.City guards, mostly large young men with indifferent expressions, pushed throughthe throng as they passed on into dark halls guarded by their fellows. A short,roughly constructed wooden wall held back all the people, confining thepandemonium to half the room. Beyond the short wall, more of the guards casuallytalked among themselves. Others brought reports to men at a simple table, joked,or picked up orders on their way through.Nicci cut right through the crowd, forcing her way to the short wall wherecowering women pressed close, hoping to be called, hoping for word, hoping forthe miracle of intercession by the Creator Himself. Pressing up against therough boards, they received splinters, instead.Nicci seized the sleeve of a passing guard. He halted in midstride. His glarerose from her hand to her eyes. She reminded herself that she was without herpower and released his sleeve.“May I ask, please, who is in charge?”He looked her up and down, a woman he appeared to judge was about to be withouta husband and available. His face slid into an affected smile. He gestured.“There. At the table. People’s Protector Muksin.”The older man sat ensconced behind his sovereign stacks of papers. Beneath achin that sank down toward his chest, his spreading body looked as if it weremelting in the summer heat. His loose white shirt bore big dark rings of sweat,adding its bit of stink to the stench of the sultry room.Guards leaned down to speak into his ear while his dull gaze roamed, neversettling. Others behind the table to either side of him were busily engaged inwork at stacks of their own papers, or speaking among themselves, or dealingwith the other stream of officials and guards that was ebbing and flowingthrough the room.Protector Muksin, the shiny top of his head concealed about as well as an agedturtle napping beneath a few blades of grass, watched the room. His dark eyesnever stopped moving, gliding past the guards, the officials, the milling crowd.When they glided over Nicci’s face, they registered no more interest than in anyof the other people. All were citizens of the Order, equal pieces, eachunimportant in and of itself.“Could I see him?” Nicci asked. “It’s important.”The guard’s smile turned to mockery. “I’m sure it is.” He waved a finger at theclump of people to the side. “End of the line. Wait your turn.”Nicci and Kamil had no choice but to wait. Nicci knew enough about such pettyofficials to know better than to make a scene. They lived for the times whensomeone made a scene. She leaned her shoulder against the plastered wall darkwith oily stains of countless other shoulders. Kamil took up station behind her.The line wasn’t moving because the officials weren’t seeing anyone. Nicci didn’tknow if they only saw citizens at certain times. There was no choice but to keeptheir place in the line. The morning dragged on without the line in front of herchanging. It grew more crowded in back.“Kamil,” she said in a low voice after several hours, “you don’t need to waitwith me. You can go home.”His eyes were red and swollen. “I wish to wait.” He sounded surprisinglydistrustful. “I care about Richard,” he added in a tone that sounded like anaccusation.“I care about him, too. Why do you think I’m here?”“I only came to get you because I was so afraid for Richard, and I didn’t knowwhat else to do. Everyone else was off to work, or to buy bread.” Kamil turnedand leaned his back against the wall. “I don’t believe that you care for him,but I didn’t know what else to do.”Nicci swiped a sweaty strand of hair off her forehead. “You don’t like me, doyou?”Still he didn’t look at her. “No.”“Might I ask why?”Kamil’s gaze snuck a glance around to see if anyone was listening. They were allconcerned with their own problems.“You are Richard’s wife, yet you betrayed him. You took Gadi to your room. Youare a whore.”Nicci blinked in surprise at his words. Kamil glanced around again before hewent on.“We don’t know why a man like Richard would be with you. Every woman without ahusband in the house, and the other houses nearby, told me she would be his wifeand never lie with another man as long as she lived. They all say they don’tunderstand why you would do that to Richard. Everyone was sad for him, but hewould not listen to us tell him.”Nicci turned away. Suddenly, she couldn’t bear the shame of looking at a youngman who had just called her a vile name, and had been right.“You don’t understand the situation,” she whispered.From the corner of her eye, she saw Kamil shrug. “You are right. I don’tunderstand. I don’t understand how anyone could do such a hurtful thing to ahusband like Richard, who works hard and takes such good care of you. To do sucha thing, you must be a bad person who does not care about your husband.”She felt tears join the sweat on her face. “I care about Richard more than youcould ever know.”He didn’t answer. She turned to look at him. He was bouncing his shouldersgently against the wall. He was too ashamed of her, or angry at her, to look herin the eye.“Kamil, do you remember when we first came to live in the room in yourbuilding?”He nodded, still not looking at her.“Do you remember how cruel you and Nabbi treated Richard, all the mean thingsyou said to him? All the hurtful names you called him? How you threatened himwith your knives?”“I made a mistake,” he said, and sounded as if he meant it.“Kamil, I made a mistake, too.” She didn’t bother trying to hide her tears-halfthe women in the room were weeping. “I can’t explain it to you, but Richard andI were having an argument. I was angry with him. I wanted to hurt him. I waswrong. It was a foolish thing for me to do. I made a terrible mistake.”She sniffled and dabbed her nose on a small handkerchief. Kamil watched her fromthe corner of his eye.“I admit it’s not the same kind of mistake that you and Nabbi made when you wereacting tough when you first met Richard, but it was a mistake. I was actingtough, too.”“You don’t desire Gadi?”“Gadi turns my stomach. I only used him because I was angry with Richard.”“And you are sorry?”Nicci’s chin trembled. “Of course I’m sorry.”“You are not going to get angry and do it again? With some other man?”“No. I told Richard I made a mistake, I was sorry, and I would never do such athing to him again. I meant what I said.”Kamil thought it over as he watched a woman shake a child by the arm. The childwouldn’t stop crying, because it wanted to be picked up. She said somethingunder her breath and the child leaned against her leg and pouted, but didn’t cryanymore.“If Richard can forgive you, then I should not be angry at you. He is yourhusband. It is for the two of you to settle, not for me.” He touched her arm.“You made a foolish mistake. It is over. Don’t cry for that anymore? There aremore important things, now.”Nicci smiled through her tears and nodded.He smiled a little bit. “Nabbi and I told Gadi we were going to cut off we toldhim we would cut him for what he had done to Richard. Gadi showed us his knife,so we would let him pass. Gadi loves his knife. He has cut men with it, before.Cut them bad. He told us to let him pass to go to join the army, that he wasgoing to use his knife to slice the guts out of the enemy, to be a war hero, andto have many women better than Richard’s wife.”“I’m sure I will not be the only woman to be sorry they ever met Gadi.”In the late afternoon, People’s Protector Muksin began seeing people. Nicci’sback ached, but it was nothing to compare to her fear for Richard. The peoplewere taken one at a time by a pair of guards to stand before Protector Muksin.The line moved fairly rapidly because the Protector tolerated no longconversations. At most, he would riffle through some of his papers beforetelling the supplicant something. What with all the wailing and weeping in theroom, Nicci couldn’t hear any of it.When it was her turn, one of the guards shoved Kamil back. “Only one citizen mayspeak with the Protector.”Nicci tilted her head to signal Kamil to stand back and not make a scene. Theguards each grabbed an arm and fairly carried her to the spot in front of theProtector. Nicci was indignant at being treated so roughly-like some common . .. citizen.She had always enjoyed a kind of authority, sometimes spoken, sometimesunspoken, and had never really given it much thought. She wanted to have Richardsee what it was like to live as the common working people. Richard seemed toflourish:The two guards stood close at her shoulders, in case she caused any trouble.They must have seen it enough. She felt her face flushing at her treatment.“Protector Muksin, my husband was-”“Name.” His dark-eyed gaze was skipping over the people remaining in line, nodoubt measuring how far off dinner was.“Richard.”He looked up sharply. “Full name.”“His name is Richard Cypher. He was taken in last evening.”Nicci didn’t want to say the word “arrested,” fearing to lend weight to aserious charge.He shuffled through papers, not at all seeming to be interested in looking ather. Nicci found it slightly confounding when the man didn’t look at her in thatcalculating way men had of measuring her dimensions in their mind, imaginingwhat they couldn’t see, as if she didn’t know what they were doing. The twoguards, though, were looking down the front of her dress.“Ah.” Protector Muksin waved a paper. “You are lucky.”“He has been released, then?”He looked up as if she were daft. “We have him. His name is on this paper. Thereare many places people are taken. The Protectors of the people can’t be expectedto know where they all are.”“Thank you,” Nicci said without knowing what she was thanking him for. “Why ishe being held? What are the charges?”The man frowned. “How would we know the charges. He has not yet confessed.”Nicci felt dizzy. A number of the other women fainted when they spoke to theProtector. The guard’s hands on her arms tightened. The Protector’s hand startedto lift to signal them to remove her. Before he could, Nicci spoke in as calm avoice as she could muster.“Please, Protector Muksin, my husband is no troublemaker. He never does anythingbut work. He never speaks ill of anyone. He is a good man. He always does as heis told.”For one fraction of a second, as she watched sweat roll down the man’s cheeks,he seemed to be considering something.“Has he a skill?”“He is a good laborer for the Order. He loads wagons.”She knew the answer was a mistake before she had completed it. The hand lifted,flicked, dismissing her like a gnat. With a mighty jerk, the guards lifted herfrom her feet and whisked her from the important man’s presence.“But my husband is a good man! Please, Protector Muksin! Richard did not causeany of the trouble! He was home!”Her words were sincere, and much the same as those spoken by the women beforeher. She was furious that she could not convince him that she was different-thatRichard was different. The others, she knew now, had all tried to do the same.Kamil ran behind as the guards carried her down a short, dark hall to a sidedoor out of the stone fortress. Evening light stole in when they opened thedoor. They shoved her. Nicci stumbled down the steps. Kamil was shoved out rightbehind her. He fell facedown in the dirt. Nicci knelt to help him up.From her knees, she looked up to the doorway. “What about my husband?” shepressed.“You can come back another day,” one guard said. “When he confesses, theProtector can tell you the charges.”Nicci knew he would never confess. He would die, first.That was not a problem, as far as these men were concerned.“Can I see him?” Nicci folded her hands prayerfully as she knelt beside Kamil.“Please, can I at least see him?”One of the guards whispered to the other.“Have you any money?” he asked her.“No,” she said in a mournful cry.They started to go back in.“Wait!” Kamil cried out.When they paused, he ran up the steps. He lifted his pant leg and pulled off aboot. Upending it, a coin fell into his palm. Without reservation, he handed thesilver coin to the guard.The man made a sour face when he looked at the coin. “This isn’t enough for avisit.”Kamil seized the big man’s wrist as he started to turn. “I have another at home.Please, let me go get it. I can run. I can be back in an hour.”The man shook his head. “Not tonight. Visits for those who can pay the fee arethe day after tomorrow, at sunset. But only one visitor is allowed.”Kamil waved his hand at Nicci. “His wife. She will visit him.”The guard swept an appraising look over Nicci, smirking, as if to consider whatmore she might have to give to see her husband.“Just be sure to bring the fee.”The door slammed shut.Kamil raced down the steps and seized her arm, his big eyes brimming with tears.“What are we going to do? That’s two more days they will have him. Two moredays!”He was starting to choke on his panic. He hadn’t said it, but she knew what hemeant. That was two more days to torture a confession out of him. Then theywould bury Richard in the sky.Nicci took a firm grip on the boy’s arm and walked him away. “Kamil, listen tome. Richard is strong. He will be all right. He’s been through a lot before.He’s strong. You know he’s strong?”Kamil was nodding as he bit his lower lip and wept, reduced to a child by hisfear for his friend.Nicci stared at the ceiling the entire night. The next day, she went to stand inline for bread. She realized, as she stood with the other women, that she musthave the same hollow look as they. She was in a daze. She didn’t know what todo. Everything seemed to be disintegrating.That night, she slept only a few hours. She was in a state of restless anxiety,counting the minutes until the sun would come up. When it did, she sat at thetable, clutching the loaf of bread she would take to Richard, waiting theeternity it took for the day to drag by. The neighbor lady, Mrs. Sha’Rim,brought Nicci a bowl of cabbage soup. She stood over Nicci, smilingsympathetically, while she waited to make sure Nicci ate the soup. Nicci thankedMrs. Sha’Rim, and said the soup was delicious. She had no idea what the souptasted like.In the early afternoon, Nicci decided to go wait at the stronghold until she wasallowed in. She didn’t want to be late. Kamil was sitting on the steps, waitingfor her. A small crowd of people milled about.Kamil shot to his feet. “I have the silver mark.”Nicci wanted to tell him that he didn’t have to pay it, that she would, but shedidn’t have a silver mark. She had only a few silver pennies.“Thank you, Kamil. I will find the money to pay you back.”“I don’t want it back. It is for Richard. It is what I choose to do for Richard.It is worth it to me.”Nicci nodded. She knew she would rot before anyone came up with a penny for her,yet she had devoted her entire life to helping others. Her mother told her oncethat it was wrong to expect thanks, that she owed help to those people becauseshe was able to give it.As Nicci walked down the steps, people came up and offered their best wishes.They asked her to tell Richard to be strong, and not to give in. They asked herto tell them if there was anything they could do, or if she needed money.They’d had Richard for days. Nicci didn’t even know if he was still alive. Thesilent walk to the prison stronghold was terror. She feared to find he had beenput to death, or to see him, and know he would die a lingering, suffering agonyfrom his questioning. Nicci knew very well how the Order questioned people.At the side door, a half-dozen other women along with a few older men stood inthe sweltering sun. All the women had sacks of food. None of the people spoke.They were all bent under the weight of the same dread.Nicci stared at the door as the sun slowly sank. In the gathering dusk, Kamilhung his waterskin on Nicci’s shoulder.“Richard will probably want something to drink with his bread and chicken.”“Thank you,” she whispered.The ironbound door squeaked open. Everyone looked up at the guard standing inthe door, signaling for everyone to approach. He glanced down at a piece ofpaper. As the first woman raced up the stairs, he stopped her and asked hername. When she told him, he checked it against his list, then let her pass. Thesecond woman he turned away. She cried out, saying she had paid for the visit.He told her that her husband had confessed to crimes of treason and was allowedno visitors.She wailed as she fell to the ground. Everyone else watched in horror, fearingthe same fate. Another woman gave her name and was sent in. Another went in,then the next was told that her husband had died.Nicci, in a daze, started up the stairs. Kamil grabbed her arm. He put a coin inher hand.“Thank you, Karnil.”He nodded. “Tell Richard I said . . . Just tell him to come home.”“Richard Cypher,” she answered the guard, her heart hammering.He looked at the paper briefly, then waved her in. “That man will take you tohim.”Relief flooded through her. He was still alive.Inside the dark hall, another soldier waited. He tilted his head in command.“Follow me.” He moved into the darkness, a lamp swinging from each hand. Shestayed close behind as he descended two long flights of narrow stairs into thedamp dark underground.In a small room with a hissing torch, People’s Protector Muksin sat on a bench,sweating, as he talked to two men-minor officials, judging by their deferentialtreatment of the rotund Protector.The Protector stood after briefly inspecting the paper the guard handed him.“You have the fee?”“Yes, Protector Muksin.” Nicci handed over the coin.He glanced at it before pocketing the silver. “Fines for civil violations aresteep,” he said cryptically as his dark eyes halted to measure her reaction.Nicci licked her lips, her hopes suddenly buoyant. She had passed the first testby paying the fee. The greedy bastard was now demanding money for Richard’slife.Nicci spoke cautiously, fearing to make a mistake. “If I knew the fine,Protector, I believe I could raise the money.”The Protector peered at her with an intensity that made sweat break out acrossher brow. “A man needs to prove his repentance. A fine that cuts to the bone isa sure way to show remorse for a civil infraction. Less, and we will know thepenance insincere. Day after tomorrow, at this time, those who have confessed tosuch infractions and have someone who can pay the price of the fine, are broughtbefore me for disposition.”He had named the price: everything. He had told her what Richard had to do. Shewanted to tear out the man’s fat throat.“Thank you for your kind understanding of my husband’s civil indiscretion. If Icould see him, I will see that he hurts to the bone in remorse.”He smiled a thin sweaty smile. “See that you do, young lady. Men left too longdown here with their guilt end up confessing to the most terrible things.”Nicci swallowed. “I understand, Protector Muksin.”The torture would not stop until the man had the price.The guard seized her arm abruptly and yanked her off down a pitch-blackcorridor, holding his two lanterns in his other hand. They went down anotherflight of stairs, down to the very bottom of the stronghold. The narrowpassageway burrowed its crooked way through the stone of the foundation, pastrooms purpose-built to hold criminals. Being not far from the river, waterseeped into the place, leaving it forever slimy, wet, and reeking of rot. Shesaw things skitter away into the blackness.The sound of their feet splashing through ankle-deep water echoed back from thedistance. Decomposing carcasses of huge rats bobbed on the waves caused by theirpassing footsteps. The place reminded Nicci of her childhood nightmares of theunderworld a fate her mother had promised awaited all those who failed in theirduty to their fellow man.The short doors to the sides each had a small opening about the size of ahand-so that the guards could look in, she supposed. There was no light at allbut what the guards brought, so there was nothing for those inside to look outat. In several of those doors, fingers gripped the edge of the opening. As thelamplight passed, Nicci saw wide eyes peering out from the black holes. Frommany of the openings came weeping of anguish, or agony.The guard stopped. “Here it is.”Her heart beating wildly, Nicci waited. Instead of opening the door, the guardturned to her and grabbed her breasts. She stood motionless, fearing to move. Hefondled her, as if he were testing melons in the market. She was too afraid tosay anything, lest he not let her see Richard. He pressed closer to her andpushed his meaty hand down inside the top of her dress, fingering her nipples.Nicci knew that men like this were necessary if the Order was to bring theirteachings to all. You had to accept that the nature of mankind was perverted.There had to be sacrifices. Brutes were necessary to enforce morality on themasses. She stifled a yelp as he pinched her tender flesh.The guard chuckled, pleased with his grope, and turned to the door. After somedifficulty with the rusty lock, he finally got the key to turn. He grasped thedoor through the opening and gave a mighty tug. The door slowly grated open justenough to get by. The guard hung a lantern just inside on the wall.“After I’ve seen to some other matters, I’ll be back and your visit will beover.” He chortled again. “Don’t waste any time getting your skirts up forhim-if he’s in any condition for it.”He shoved her in the room. “Here you go, Cypher. I got her nice and randy foryou.” The door shut with a clang that echoed up and down the crooked passageway.Nicci heard the key turn and the guard’s sloshing footsteps as he departed.The square room was so tiny she could have stretched her arms and touched thewalls to each side at the same time. The ceiling brushed the top of her head.She was overwhelmed by the terrifying closeness of it. She wanted out.She feared the body crumpled at her feet was dead.“Richard?”She heard a little groan. His arms were behind his back, locked in some kind ofwooden binders. She feared he might drown.Tears stung her eyes. She sank to her knees. The slimy water that had sloshedinto her boots now soaked up through her dress.“Richard?”She pulled at his shoulder to turn him over. He cried out and shrank away fromher hand.When she saw him, she covered her mouth with both hands to stifle her scream.She felt the tears flooding down her face as she gasped to get her breath.“Oh, Richard.”Nicci stood and tore off a strip of her shift from under her dress. Kneelingonce more, she used the cloth to gently wipe the blood from his face.“Richard, can you hear me? It’s Nicci.”He nodded. “Nicci.”One eye was swollen shut. His hair was matted with mud and slime from the waterhe lay in. His clothes were torn open. In the harsh light from the small lamp,she could see puffy red wounds crisscrossing his flesh.He saw her staring at his wounds. “I’m afraid you’ll never be able to patch thisshirt.”She offered a feeble smile at his grim humor. Her fingers trembled as she wipedhis face. She didn’t know why she would react this way. She had seen worse thanthis.Richard pulled his head back away from her ministrations.“Am I hurting you?”“Yes.”“Sorry. I have some water.”He nodded eagerly. Nicci poured water into his mouth from the waterskin. Hedrank greedily.While he caught his breath, she said, “Kamil came up with the money for the feeto get me in to see you.”Richard only smiled.“Kamil wants you out of here.”“I want me out of here.” He didn’t sound like himself. His voice was hoarse andalmost gone.“Richard, the Protector”“Who?”“The official in charge of this, this prison. He told me that there is a way toget you out. He said you must plead guilty to a civil infraction, and pay afine.”Richard was nodding. “I figured as much. He asked if I had money. I told him Idid.”“You do? You’ve saved money?”He nodded. “I have money.”Nicci’s fingers desperately gathered his collar into her fist. “Richard, I can’tpay the fine to get you out for two more days. Can you hold on? Please, can youhold on until then?”He smiled in the dim lamplight. “I’m not going anywhere.”Nicci remembered then, and pulled the bread out of the sack. “I brought food.Bread, and some roasted chicken.”“Chicken. Bread won’t sustain me long. They don’t feed me.”She tore at the chicken with her fingers. She held a piece up to his mouth forhim. She couldn’t stand to see Richard helpless. It angered her. It made hersick.“Eat, Richard,” she urged when his head sank forward. He shook his head, as ifto banish sleep. “Here, have some more.”She watched him chew. “Can you sleep in this water?”“They don’t let you sleep. They-”She pushed a long chunk of chicken in his mouth. She knew too many of thedetails of the Order’s methods. She didn’t want to know which technique they hadchosen for him.“I’ll get you out, Richard. Don’t give up. I’ll get you out.”He shrugged as if to say it didn’t matter.“Why? Covetous of your prisoner? Jealous to see others abuse me in your place?Fear they might destroy me before you can?”“Richard, that’s not-”“I am just a man. Only the greater good matters. That I’m innocent isimmaterial, because no one man’s life has value. If I must suffer and die thisway to help drive others to the ways of your Creator and your Order, who are youto deny them that virtuous end? What do your wishes matter? How can you put yourlife, or mine, above the good of others?”How many times had she lectured him with that same moral doctrine? Howcontemptuous, how venomous, how treacherous it sounded from his lips.She hated herself at that moment. He somehow put the lie to everything the Orderstood for, to everything she had devoted her life to. He somehow made doing goodseem . . . evil. That was why he was so dangerous. That he even existedthreatened everything for which they stood.She was so close. So close to knowing what she needed to understand. The veryfact that there were tears running down her face told her that there really wassomething that made the whole ordeal worthwhile-made it essential. Theindefinable spark she had seen in his eyes from the first instant was real.If she could just reach that little bit more, then she could finally do what wasbest. It would be better for him. What kind of life could he ever have? How muchsuffering could he endure? She hated that she was condemned to serving theCreator in such a way.“Look around, Nicci. You wanted to show me the better way of the Order. Lookaround. Isn’t it glorious?”She hated to see one of his beautiful eyes swollen shut.“Richard, I need the money you saved. If I’m to get you out of here, I’ll needit all. The official told me it had to be all of what you had.”A hoarse whisper was all he had left. “It’s in our room.”“Our room? Where? Tell me where.”He shook his head. “You could never get it out. You have to know the trick toopen it. Go to Ishaq.”“Ishaq? At the transport company? Why?”“It was his parlor, once. There’s a hidden compartment in the floor. Tell himwhy you need the money. He will open it for you.”She held more chicken up to his mouth. “All right. I’ll go to Ishaq.” Shehesitated while she watched him chew. “I’m sorry that you have to give up whatyou’ve managed to save. I know how hard you work. It’s not right for them totake it.”He shrugged again. “Just money. I’d rather live.”Nicci smiled and wiped the tears from her cheeks. That was the best thing shecould have hoped to hear.The door opened. “Pull your skirt down, woman. Time’s up.”As he dragged her out by her arm, she stuffed the last of the chicken inRichard’s mouth.“Civil infraction!” she called to him. “Don’t forget!”He had to confess to a civil infraction that could be paid with a fine. Thenthey would release him. Any other crime was death.“I won’t forget.”She reached back toward him as she was pulled from the tiny cell. “I’ll be backfor you, Richard! I swear!”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 56Nicci paced as Ishaq bent over the trapdoor in the corner of the room. He hadbeen at it a long time. He had pushed the wardrobe aside to get at the secretplace in the floor. Occasionally he muttered under his breath, cursing himselffor having made it so difficult to get into.“At last!” Ishaq scrambled to his feet.Nicci hoped that the meager money Richard could have managed to save would beenough to satisfy Protector Muksin. In her head, she was going through a list ofpeople who had offered money to help Richard.Ishaq scurried close. “Here it is.”He hurriedly placed the leather purse in her hand. The weight shocked her. Thepurse filled her palm. It didn’t make sense. She realized Richard must have putsome metal items in with his savings-that would account for the weight. Shepulled open the top and dumped the contents in her palm.Nicci gasped. There were close to two dozen gold marks. There wasn’t any silver.It was all gold.“Dear Creator...” she whispered, her eyes wide. “Where would Richard get allthis money?”It was more money than most wealthy men saw in their lifetime. She looked upinto Ishaq’s eyes.“Where would Richard get all this money?”He swept his red hat off his head. He waved impatiently at all the gold lying inher palm. “Richard earned it.”She felt her frown darkening. “Earned it? How? No one man could earn this muchmoney-not honestly, anyway.” She felt her anger building. “Richard stole thisgold, didn’t he?”“Don’t be silly.” Ishaq gestured irritably. “Richard earned it. He bought andsold goods.”She gritted her teeth. “How did he get this money?”The man flung up his hands. “I’m telling you. He earned it himself-all byhimself. He bought things and sold them to people who needed them.”“Things? What kind of things? Contraband?”“No! Things like iron and steel”“Nonsense. How would he move it? Carry it on his back?”“At first. But then he bought a wagon to-”“A wagon!”“Yes. And horses. He bought charcoal and ore and sold them to the foundries.Mostly, he bought metal from the foundry, and sold it to the blacksmith. Theblack smith uses a great deal of metal. He bought it from Richard. That was howhe earned the money.”Nicci seized the man’s collar at his throat. “Take me to this blacksmith.”Nicci was furious. All this time, she had thought Richard an honest hardworkingman, and now she had discovered that he was imprisoned properly. He was guiltyof swindling honest working people out of their money. He was profiteering.At that moment, she was not sorry at all for what they were doing to him in theprison. He deserved it all, and more. He was a criminal, cheating honesthardworking people out of gold. She burned with humiliation, knowing she hadbeen deceived by him.Nicci had seen the site of the palace before, but at a distance as she wentabout her business in the city. She had never been this close. It was going tobe everything Jagang said it would be. It filled her with awe. All the inspiringwords of Brother Narev from her youth were like a sacred choir singing from thedepths of her memories as she looked upon the sweep of scenes being erected.The walls were already up over the openings for the windows on the first floor.In some sections, beams were being laid, spanning the interior walls, to supportthe next story.But it was the outside which took her breath. The stone walls were banded withcarvings on a scale she had never imagined. Just as Brother Narev would havedirected, the carvings were inspirational, and convincing. Nicci saw peoplegazing upon the scenes, weeping at the events recounted in stone, weeping at thedepiction of the miserable creature that was man, and the unattainable glorythat was the perfection of the Creator. With such moving visions, there could beno doubt that the Order was mankind’s only hope of salvation. Just as Jagang hadsaid, this would be a palace to stir the people with overpowering emotion.“Why are those poles there?” she asked Ishaq as they marched along the widecobbled path where people stood and watched the construction, while others kneltand prayed at various horrific scenes depicted on the walls.“Carvers.” Ishaq removed his red hat as he looked at the sight. “It was saidthey took part in the revolt.”Nicci’s gaze passed among the rotting corpses hanging at the tops of the poles.“Why would the carvers take part in the revolt? They have work.” More than that,they were working on the scenes of the glory of the Order. They, of all people,should have known how their only hope of reward in the next world requiredsuffering in this.“I did not say they took part. I said that it was said that they took part.”Nicci didn’t correct the man. All men were corrupt. There wasn’t a man who couldnot be put to death without it being justified. That included Richard.Many of the stones under protective roofs where men had worked now sat idle.Ramps were constructed, along with scaffolding, for the masons to work on thepalace walls. As they placed their stone, other men, slave labor, worked athauling huge blocks up the ramps to them, carried baskets of mortar or dirt androck, or worked in trenches building the underground cells where the Order wouldpurge the world of the worst sinners and where criminals would confess theircrimes.It was a terrible business, but you couldn’t have a garden unless you got yourhands dirty first.The blacksmith’s shop, up on the side of a hill overlooking the colossalundertaking, was the largest she had ever seen. With a project of this scale, itwas understandable. She stood outside while Ishaq hurried in to fetch theblacksmith for her.The sounds of hammers ringing on steel, the smells of the forge, the smoke, theoils, the acid, the brine, all brought back a flood of memories of her father’sshop. For a brief moment, Nicci’s heart beat faster-she was a girl again. Shealmost expected to see her father come out and smile at her with that wondrousenergy of his showing in his blue eyes.Instead, a brawny man stepped out of the shadows into the daylight. He wore nosmile, but a menacing glare. At first, she thought he was bald. Then she sawthat his full head of hair was simply cropped close to his scalp. Some of herfather’s men who worked with hot iron did the same. His scowl would have set anyother woman back three paces.He wiped his hands on a rag as he walked through the milky sunlight toward her,appraising her eyes more carefully than most men-other than Richard. His thickleather apron was speckled with hundreds of tiny burn marks.“Mrs. Cypher?”Ishaq backed away, contenting himself to be a shadow.“That’s right. I’m Richard’s wife.”“Funny, Richard never really spoke of you. I guess I just assumed he had a wife,but he never said--”“Richard has been taken into custody.”The scowl changed in an instant to wide-eyed concern. “Richard’s been arrested?For what?”“Apparently, for the most base of crimes: cheating people.”“Cheating people? Richard? They’re out of their minds.”“I’m afraid not. He is guilty. I have the evidence.”“What evidence?”Ishaq swooped in close, unable to contain himself any longer. “Richard’s money.The money he made.”“Made!” Nicci’s shout drove Ishaq back a step. “You mean the money he stole.”The blacksmith’s scowl had returned. “Stole? Who do you think he stole thismoney from? Who are his accusers? Where are his victims?”“Well, you are one.”“Me?”“Yes, I’m afraid you were one of his victims. I’m here to return your money. Ican’t use stolen money to rescue a criminal from his just punishment. Richardwill have to pay the price for his crime. The Order will see that he does.”The blacksmith tossed his towel aside and planted his fists on his hips.“Richard never stole one ‘silver penny from anyone-least of all, me! He earnedhis money.”“He cheated you.”“He sold me iron and steel. I need iron and steel to make things for theRetreat. Brother Narev comes in here and growls at me to get things made, but hedoesn’t deliver me the iron from which I must make them. Richard does. UntilRichard came along, I nearly got buried in the sky myself, because Ishaq, here,couldn’t get me enough iron and steel.”“I couldn’t! The committee only gives me permission to bring what I bring. Iwould be buried in the sky myself if I bring more than I have permission tobring. Everybody at the transport company watches me. They report me to theworkers’ group if I spit wrong.”“So,” Nicci said, folding her arms, “Richard has you over your own brine barrel.He brings you iron at night and you have no choice but to pay him his price, andhe knows it. He makes all this gold by gouging you. That’s how he got rich-byovercharging you. That’s the worst kind of thievery.”The blacksmith frowned at her as if she were daft.“Richard sells me iron and steel for a lot less than I can buy it through theregular transport companies-like from Ishaq.”“I charge what the committee on fair pricing tells me! I have no say!”“That’s just crazy,” Nicci said to the blacksmith, ignoring Ishaq.“No, it’s smart. You see, the foundries produce more than they can sell, becausethey can’t get it moved. Their furnaces have to be heated whether they make oneton or ten. They need to make enough iron to make the heat worth it, to paytheir workers, and to keep their furnaces going. If they don’t buy enough ore,the mines close and then the foundry can’t get any ore at all. They can’t existif they can’t get raw materials. But the Order won’t let Ishaq, and those likehim, move as much as the foundries need moved. The Order takes weeks to decideon the simplest request. They consider every imaginable person who they fancymight conceivably be hurt if Ishaq were to move the load. The foundries weredesperate. They offered to sell their extra to Richard at less money-”“So they are cheated in Richard’s scheme, too!”“No, because Richard takes it, they sell more, so it costs them less to make.They make more money than they would have otherwise. Richard sells it to me forless than I have to pay from the regular transport companies, because he buys itfor less.”Nicci threw her hands up in disgust. “And to top it off, he is putting workingmen out of jobs. He’s the worst sort of criminal-making his profit off the backsof the poor, the needy, and the workers!”“What?” Ishaq protested. “I can’t get enough people to work, and I can’t getenough permits to haul the goods people need. Richard puts no one out of work-hehelps create more business for everybody. The foundries he hauls for have eachhired more men since they are able to sell through Richard.”“That’s right,” the blacksmith said.“But, you just don’t see it,” Nicci insisted as she raked back her hair. “He’spulled the wool over your eyes. He’s cheating you-milking you dry. You’regetting poor because Richard-”“Don’t you get it, Mrs. Cypher? Richard has made half a dozen foundries money.They are working now only because of Richard. He moves their goods when theyneed them moved, not when they can finally get some asinine permit with sealsall over it. Richard has, by himself, enabled a whole string of charcoal makersto earn a living supplying those foundries, along with a number of miners andany number of other people. And me? Richard has made me more money than I everthought I’d make.”“Richard has made us all rich by doing something that is desperately needed, anddoing it better than others can do it. He has kept us all working. Not the Orderand their committees, boards, and groups, Richard.”“I’ve been able to keep men on because of Richard. He never says it can’t bedone; he figures a way to do it. In the process, he has earned the trust ofevery man he deals with. His word is as good as that gold.“Why, even Brother Narev told Richard to do what needed doing to get me the ironI needed. Richard told him he would. The palace wouldn’t be this far along ifnot for Richard keeping everyone going with what he gets for us, when we needit.“The Order owes Richard a debt of gratitude, not torture and punishment. He hashelped the Order by doing what they need done. Those piers standing out therewould not be built yet, if Richard hadn’t found me the iron to make the bracingties. Those carvings on the palace walls down there would not be done if hehadn’t gotten me the steel I needed to make the tools to carve them. The goodsdown there are only moved in by wheels turning on iron bands I make to repairthem because Richard got me the steel. Richard has done more to raise thatpalace up out of the ground than any other single man. Besides that, he’s madefriends doing it.”Nicci couldn’t make it work in her head. It had to be true; she remembered thatRichard had met Brother Narev. How could someone make so much money, help theOrder, and have the people he deals with still trust him?“But he has made all this profit. . .”The blacksmith shook his head as if she were a snake among them. “ `Profit’ is adirty word only to the leeches of the world. They want it seen as evil, so theycan more easily snatch what they did not earn.”The frown returned as the blacksmith leaned toward her. His voice became as hotas the iron he worked.“What I want to know, Mrs. Cypher, is why Richard is in some stinking prisonbeing tortured to give a confession, while his wife is standing here acting afool over him earning money and making us all happy and rich in the process?”Nicci felt a lump rising in her throat. “I can’t pay the fine until tomorrownight.”“Until I met you, I never thought Richard ever made a mistake.” The man pulledhis leather apron off over his head and heaved it at the wall of his shop. “Withthat kind of money, we can bargain him out sooner. I hope it’s soon enough.Ishaq, are you with me?”“Of course. They know me. I’m trusted. I go, too.”“Give me the money,” the blacksmith commanded.Nicci dropped it into his upturned palm without even thinking about it. Richardwasn’t really a thief. It was a wonder. She didn’t know how, but these peoplewere all happy with him. He made them all rich. It didn’t make any sense to her.“Please, if you can help, I’d be indebted to you.”“I’m not doing it for you, Mrs. Cypher; I’m helping a friend I value who isworth helping.”“Nicci. My name is Nicci.”“I’m Mr. Cascella he growled as he started away.Mr. Cascella tossed four gold coins on the table in front of People’s ProtectorMuksin. He had told Nicci and Ishaq that he wanted to hold something in reserveso they could “pump the bellows” if they “needed more heat.”The blacksmith towered over the man behind the table. Several officers put theirnoses to their work. The guards around the room all watched.“Richard Cypher. You have him. We’re here to pay the fine.”Protector Muksin blinked at the coins like a fat carp that was too full to eat aworm.“We don’t assess fines until tomorrow night. Come back then, and if this man,Cypher, has not confessed to involvement in anything more serious, you can paythen.”“I work out at the new palace,” Mr. Cascella said. “Brother Narev keeps me busy.I’m here now, so couldn’t we just take care of this matter while we’re all here?It would make Brother Narev happy if his head blacksmith didn’t have to come allthe way over here again tomorrow, when I’m here now.”Protector Muksin’s dark eyes turned from side to side, traversing the crowdedroom of wailing people. His chair chattered as he scooted it closer to thetable. He folded his stubby fingers atop a pile of tattered papers.“I would not wish to inconvenience Brother Narev.”The blacksmith smiled. “I thought not.”“However, Brother Narev would not want me to overlook my duty to the people.”“Of course not!” Ishaq put it. He swiped his red hat off his head when the darkeyes turned his way. “Such was not implied, of course. We are trusting in you todo your duty.”“Who are you?” the Protector asked Nicci.“I am the wife of Richard Cypher, Protector Muksin. I was here before. I paid afee to see him. You explained the fine to me.”He nodded. “I see so many.”“Look,” Mr. Cascella said, “we have a lot of money for the fine. If we could payit now and get Richard Cypher out today, that is. Some of it is money otherpeople might not be willing to contribute tomorrow.”The blacksmith slid four more gold marks across the table. The Protector’s darkeyes looked unimpressed.“The money all belongs to the people. There is great need.”Nicci suspected that the great need was in his pocket, and that he was holdingout for more. As if to answer the charge, Protector Muksin slid the eight goldcoins-a fortune by any standard of measure-back across the table.“The money would not be paid here. We have no use for it. We are humble servantsof the Order. The amount of the fine would be noted in the ledger, but you wouldhave to deliver it to a citizen committee for distribution to those in need.”Nicci was surprised that she had been wrong about the man. He was indeed anhonest official. This changed the nature of the whole business. Her hopesbrightened. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so difficult to get Richard released, afterall.Behind her, on the other side of the short wall, women were wailing, childrenwere crying, and people were praying. Nicci could hardly breathe in the stinkingsweltering room. She hoped that the official would be moved to hurry the case sohe could get to attending the matter of the small crowd of guards who waited offin the side halls for papers and orders.“But you make a mistake,” the Protector added, “if you think money can buy thisman’s release. The Order is not concerned with the life of one man, for no man’slife is of any real importance. I’m inclined to tell you to keep yourmoney-until we can look into why anyone would have such a large sum. I thinkthis man must be disruptive to civil order if he stirs up this much support. Noone man is any better than another. That he can bring so much money to bribe himout of his just punishment proves my suspicion that he has something toconfess.”His chair creaked as he leaned back to peer up at them. “It appears you threewould think otherwisethink that he is better than any other man.”“No,” the blacksmith said in an offhanded manner, “it’s just that he is ourfriend.”“The Order is your friend. Those in need are your concern. You have no businesscaring for one man over another. Such unseemly behaviour is blasphemy.”The three of them before the desk stood mute. Behind them, the weeping, thewailing, the panicked praying for those in the darkness far below, went onwithout pause. Everything they said only seemed to turn the man more againstthem.“If he had a skill, then it might be different. There is great need forcontributions to the Order by those with ability. There are many who hold backwhen they should be doing their best to contribute. It is the duty of those withability to-”It all came clear to Nicci in one blinding instant.“But he does have a skill,” she blurted out.“What skill?” the Protector asked, not pleased at being interrupted.Nicci stepped closer. “He is the greatest-”“Greatness is a delusion of the wicked. All men are the same. All men are evilby nature. All men must struggle to overcome their baser nature by devotingtheir lives selflessly to the cause of helping their fellow man. Only selflessacts will enable a man to gain his reward in the afterlife.”Mr. Cascella’s fists tightened. He started to lean in. If he argued, now, itwould render the matter irredeemable. Nicci gave him a stealthy kick with theside of her foot, hoping to convince him to be quiet and let her do the talkingbefore it was too late. Nicci bowed her head as she retreated a step, forcingthe blacksmith aside without making it look obvious.“You are wise, Protector Muksin. We could all learn valuable lessons from you.Please forgive the inept words of a poor wife. I am a simple woman, humbled anddiscomposed in the presence of such a wise representative of the Fellowship ofOrder.”Startled, the Protector said nothing. Nicci had traded in such words for over ahundred years, and knew their value. She had given the man, but a pettyofficial, a standing in the core of the Order-in the fellowship itself-that hecould never attain. This sort of man would aspire to wear the mantle of socialmerit. To a man like this, to be thought to hold such intellectual status was asgood as earning it; perception was reality to such men. The perception was whatcounted, not the actual accomplishment.“What is this man’s skill?”Nicci bowed her head again. “Richard Cypher is an undistinguished stone carver,Protector Muksin.”The men to either side of her stared in disbelief.“A stone carver?” the Protector asked, lingering in thought over the words.“A faceless artisan, his only hope in life that he could one day work in stoneto show man’s wickedness, so that he might help others see the need to sacrificeto their fellow man and the Order and in this way hope to earn his reward in theafterlife.”The blacksmith quickly recovered and added to her words. “As you may know, manyof the carvers at the Retreat were traitors-thank the Creator they werediscovered-and so there is much carving to be done for the glory of the Order.Brother Narev can confirm this for you, Protector Muksin.”The Protector’s dark eyes shifted among the three. “How much money do you have?”“Twenty-two gold marks,” Nicci said.He scowled his condemnation as he pulled a ledger book close and dipped his penin a chipped ink bottle. The Protector bent forward and wrote the fine in hisbook. He next wrote an order on a piece of paper and handed it up to theblacksmith.“Take this to the workers’ hall at the docks”-he gestured with his pen offbehind them-”down that street. I will release the prisoner after you bring me aworkers’ group seal to prove that the fine was paid to the men who deserve itmost-those in need. Richard Cypher must be stripped of his ill-gotten gains.”Richard deserved it most, Nicci thought bitterly. He had earned it, not thoseother men. Nicci thought about all the nights he’d worked without sleep, withoutfood. She remembered him wincing as he lay down to sleep, his back aching fromhis labor. Richard had earned that money-she knew that, now. Those men who wouldget it had done nothing for it but to desire it, thus proclaiming their right toit.“Yes, Protector Muksin,” Nicci said as she bowed. “Thank you for your wisejustice.”Mr. Cascella let out a quiet sigh. Nicci leaned confidentially toward theProtector.“We will carry out your equitable instructions immediately.” She smileddeferentially. “Since you have treated us so fairly in this matter, might I askone further consideration?” It was a lot of gold that would be credited to hiseffort on behalf of the Order; she knew he would likely be in a generous mood atthat moment. “It’s more a matter of curiosity, really.”He wheezed an annoyed sigh. “What is it you want?”Nicci leaned closer, close enough to smell the man’s stale sweat. “The name ofthe person who reported my husband. The one who rightly brought Richard Cypherto justice.”Nicci knew that he was thinking that men were more likely to be welcomed intothe fellowship when they helped collect great sums for those in need. The matterof the name would only be a gnat bothering his pleasant thoughts. He pulled somepapers close and scanned through them, flipping them aside as he searched.“Here it is,” Protector Muksin said at last. “Richard Cypher’s name was reportedby a young soldier volunteering in the Imperial Order army. His name is Gadi.The report is months old. It took some time to see justice done, but the Orderalways sees justice done in the end. That is why they call our great emperor‘Jagang the Just.’ “Nicci straightened. “Thank you, Protector Muksin.”Her calm face concealed her inner fury that the little thug was out of herreach. Gadi deserved to suffer.The Protector wrote out his sentence for a civil crime as he spoke. “Take theorder of fine I gave you to the workers’ group at the docks and return here whenyou have seals to prove that his fine of twenty-two gold marks was paid in full.“Richard Cypher is further ordered to report to the carver’s committee for workassignment.” He handed her the paper with the orders. “Richard Cypher is now astone carver for the Order.”The sun was setting by the time they returned with all the papers and seals. Theblacksmith was impressed with the way she had handled the official when theoffer of gold failed to work. Ishaq thanked her a hundred times. It onlymattered to her that Richard would be freed.She was relieved to know that she had been wrong, that Richard wasn’t a cheatand a thief after all. It had been such an ugly feeling, thinking ill ofRichard. It had for a time tainted her whole world. She had never been so happyto be wrong.Better yet, they had done it; she was to have him back.At the side door to the stronghold, Mr. Cascella, Ishaq, and Nicci waited. Theshadows grew darker. Finally, the door opened. Two guards held Richard betweenthem as they came out onto the landing. When they saw Richard, his condition,Mr. Cascella cursed under his breath. Ishaq whispered a prayer.The guards released Richard with a shove. He stumbled forward. The blacksmithand Ishaq raced to the steps to help him.Richard caught himself and straightened, a dark form upright in the last of thelight, defiant of the long shadows around him. He held a hand out, commandingthe two men to stay where they were. Both stopped with a foot on the bottomstep, ready to run up to him should he need them. Nicci couldn’t imagine whatpain it had to cost Richard to walk so steadily, proudly, smoothly down thestairs without help, as if he were a free man.He did not yet know what she had done to him.Nicci knew there could be no worse plight for Richard. The torture down in thedepths of the stronghold was not as bad as what she had just condemned him to.Nicci was sure that this was the one thing, at last, that would force out theanswer she sought, if there really was an answer to be found."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 57Brother Narev paused behind Richard’s shoulder, a shadow come to visit. He oftenlurked nearby, making sure the carvings were progressing as directed. This wasthe first time the great man himself had stopped to watch Richard work.“Don’t I know you?” The voice was like stone grating on stone.Richard let his arm holding the hammer drop to his side as he looked up. Hewiped the dusty sweat from his brow with the back of his left hand, stillholding the clawed stone chisel.“Yes, Brother Narev. I was a laborer hauling iron, at the time. I was bringing aload to the blacksmith one day when I was honored to meet you.”Brother Narev frowned suspiciously. Richard allowed no crack in his facade ofinnocent calm.“A laborer, and now a carver?”“I have ability which I am joyful to contribute to my fellow man. I am gratefulfor the opportunity the Order has given me to earn my reward in the next life bysacrificing in this.”“Joyful.” Neal, the shadow of the shadow, stepped forward. “You are joyful tocarve, are you?”“Yes, Brother Neal.”Richard was joyful that Kahlan was alive. He didn’t think about the rest of it.He was a prisoner, and what he had to do to keep Kahlan alive, he would do; thatwas all there was to it. What was, was.Brother Neal smirked his superiority at Richard’s obeisance. The man had comeoften to lecture the carvers, and Richard had come to know him all too well. Thecarvers’ work, being the influential face the palace would show to the people,was critically important to the Fellowship of Order. Richard was frequently theobject of Neal’s harangues. Neal, a wizard, not a sorcerer like Brother Narev,always seemed to feel,the need to prove his moral authority around Richard.Richard gave him no rough edge to grip, yet Neal still persisted in clawing forone.Brother Narev believed his own words with grim conviction: mankind was evil;only through selfless sacrifice to your fellow man had you any hope to redeemyourself in the afterlife. There was no joy in his faith, simply a ruthless dutyto it.Neal, on the other hand, bubbled over with his feelings. He believed in theOrder’s doctrine with an impassioned, incandescent, arrogant pride, gleefullyconvinced the world needed iron-fisted direction which only enlightenedintellectuals, such as himself, could provide-with grudging deference to BrotherNarev, of course.Richard had more than once overheard Neal proclaim with conviction that if hehad to order the tongues cut out of a million innocent men, it would be betterthan to allow one man to blaspheme against the self-evident, righteous nature ofthe Order’s ways.Brother Neal, a fresh-faced young man-no doubt deceptively young, consideringthat Nicci said he had once lived at the Palace of the Prophets-frequentlyaccompanied Brother Narev, basking in his mentor’s approval. Neal was BrotherNarev’s chief lieutenant. His face might have been fresh, but his ideas werenot; tyranny was ancient, even if Neal deluded himself in believing it thebright new salvation of mankind when applied by him and his fellows. His ideaswere a paramour he embraced with a lover’s boundless, blind passion-a truthdiscovered with a lover’s lust.Nothing stirred him to anger quicker than the whiff of argument orcontradiction, no matter how reasoned. In the heat of his passion, Neal wasperfectly willing to destroy any dissension, torture any opposition, kill anynumber, who failed to bow before the pedestal upon which stood his irrefutablynoble ideals.No misery, no failure, no amount of wailing and anguish and death, could dim hisglowing conviction that the ways of the Order were the only correct course formankind.The other disciples, all, like Neal, wearing hooded brown robes, were anincongruous collection of the cruel, the pompously idealistic, the bitterlygreedy, the resentful, the spiteful, the timid, and, most of all, thedangerously deluded. All shared an underlying, caustic, inner loathing formankind which manifested itself in a conviction that anything pleasurable forthe people could only be evil and accordingly only sacrifice could be good.All, with the exception of Neal, were blind followers and completely under thespell of Brother Narev. They believed Brother Narev far closer to the Creatorthan to man. They hung on his every word, believing each to be divinelyinspired. Were he to tell them they must kill themselves for the cause, Richardwas sure they would break their necks rushing for the nearest knife.Neal was alone in that he believed in the divinity of his own words, in additionto Brother Narev’s. Every leader had to have a successor. Richard was prettysure Neal had already decided who would best serve as the next incarnation ofthe Order.“A peculiar choice of words, joyful.” Brother Narev circled a knobby fingertoward the cowering, deformed, frightened figures Richard was working on. “Thismakes you . . . joyful?”Richard gestured to the Light he had carved so as to shine down on the wretchedmen. “This, Brother Narev, is what makes me joyful-being able to show mencowering before the perfection of the Creator’s Light. It makes me joyful toshow mankind’s wickedness for all to see, for in this way they will know theirduty to the Order above all else.”Brother Narev made a suspicious sound deep in his throat. The sunlight hoodedhis dark eyes more than usual and seemed to deepen the creases around his mouthas he regarded Richard with a look sharing mistrust and loathing, laced withapprehension. Only the apprehension was any different than the look he gaveeveryone. Richard fed him a vacant stare. The brother’s mouth finally twistedwith the dismissal of his private thoughts.“I approve . . . I forgot your name. But then, names are not important. Men arenot important. Individually, each man is but a meaningless cog in the greatwheel of mankind. How that wheel turns is all that matters, not the cogs.”“Richard Cypher.”One brow, flocked in tangled white and black hair, lifted.“Yes . . . Richard Cypher. Well, I approve of your carving, Richard Cypher. Youseem to understand better than most how man is properly depicted.”Richard bowed. “It is not my hand, but the Creator guiding it to help the Ordershow the way.”The suspicious look was back, but Richard’s expression made Brother Narevfinally believe the words. Brother Narev, his hands clasped behind his back,glided away to see to other matters. Neal, like a child sticking close to hismother’s skirts, scurried to stay close to Brother Narev’s robes. He cast ascowl back over his shoulder. Richard almost expected to see Neal stick out histongue.As best as Richard could figure, there were about fifty of the brown-robeddisciples. He saw them often enough to come to know their nature. Victor hadmentioned to Richard that one of the foundries had cast in pure gold, from themaster that the blacksmith had made; somewhere near the same numbers of thespell-forms. Victor thought them only decorations. Richard had seen several ofthe gold spell-forms being installed onto the tops of huge, ornate stone pillarsset out around the grounds of the Retreat. The pillars, in polished marble, weredesigned and placed to look like grand decorations for a grand place. Richardsuspected they were more.Richard went back to chiseling a thick, unbending limb. At least, now, his ownlimbs worked again. It had been a while, but he was healed. This, though, seemedno less a torture.People gathered every day to view the low relief carvings already up on thewalls. Some people knelt on the cobblestone walks before the scenes, praying,till their knees bled. Some brought rags to put beneath their knees as theyprayed. Many simply stared with forsaken looks at the nature of mankind depictedin stone.Richard could see in the faces of many who came that they had come with somekind of vague, undefinable hope, hungering for some essential answer to aquestion they could not formulate. The emptiness in their eyes as they left washeartbreaking. They were people being drained of life no less than those bled todeath in the dungeons of the Order.Some of those people gathered to watch the carvers work. In the two monthsRichard had worked at carving for the Retreat, the crowds grew larger to watchhim than any of the other men. The people sometimes wept at what they saw emergefrom beneath Richard’s chisels.In the two months Richard had worked at carving for the Retreat, he had come tounderstand the nuance of carving in stone. What he carved was dispiriting, butthe act of carving itself helped to make up for it. Richard reveled in thetechnical aspects of applying steel to stone, guided by intent.As much as he hated the things he had to carve, he came to love working stonewith a chisel. The marble seemed almost alive under his touch. He would oftencarve some tiny part with reverence for the subject-a finger gracefully lifted,a eye with knowing vision, a chest holding a heart of reason.After he accomplished such grace, he would deface it to suit the Order. Moreoften than not, that was when people wept.Richard invented impossibly stiff, stilted, contorted people bent under theweight of guilt and shame. If this was the way to preserve Kahlan’s life, thenhe would make everyone who saw the carvings weep their hearts out. In a way,they were doing the weeping for him, suffering over the carvings for him, beingdestroyed by what they saw, for him.In this way, he was able to endure the torture.When the shadows lengthened to dusk and the day was finished, the carversstarted putting away their tools into simple wooden boxes before going home forthe night. They all would return not long after first light. The master builderprovided them with orders for areas and shapes to be covered with carving sothey could shape the stones to the correct size. Brother Narev’s disciples cameby to provide the details of the stories to be told in stone.The stone Richard carved was for the grand entrance to the Retreat. Marble stepsswept around in a half circle, leading up to the huge, round plaza. A colonnadeof pillars in a half circle, mirroring the steps, surrounded the back half ofthe plaza. Richard’s job was carving the sweep of scenes that were placed abovethose columns.It was to be an entrance which set the tone for the entire palace. In the centerof the plaza Brother Neal had told Richard that Brother Narev’s vision was thatthere would be the statue dominating the entrance to the palace, and it was tobe a work which would strike down any observer with an overpowering sense oftheir own guilt and shame at mankind’s evil nature. The statue, in its horror,was a call to selfless sacrifice, and was to be built into the form of asundial, showing people cowering under the Light of their Creator.Neal had described it with such delight that the image it created in Richard’smind sickened him.Richard was the last to leave the site. As he often did, he headed up the hill,along the winding road, to the workshops. Victor was in his shop, banking hiscoals for the night. With autumn upon them, the days weren’t insufferably hot,so the forge wasn’t the miserable place it had been in high summer. Winter thisfar south in the Old World was never harsh, but the forge in winter would be agood place to banish the chill that would come on cold rainy days.“Richard! So good to see you.” The blacksmith knew why Richard was there. “Go onback. Maybe I will come sit with you when I’m finished, here?”Richard gave his friend a smile and said, “I’d like that.”Richard opened the double doors at the rear, letting the last of the light fillthe room where stood the marble. He came often to see the monolith. Sometimes,after a day of carving ugliness, he had to come and look at the stone andimagine the beauty inside. That balance sometimes seemed as if it was all thatsustained him.Richard’s fingers, dusty from his work carving stone, reached out to feel thewhite Cavatura marble. It was slightly different from the stone he carved downat the site. He had the experience, now, to discern the subtle difference. Thegrain was finer in Victor’s stone, harder; it would better take and hold detail.Under Richard’s fingers, the stone was as cool as moonlight, and just as chaste.When he looked up, Victor was standing nearby, smiling wistfully, watchingRichard and the stone.“After carving such ugliness, it is good to look upon the beauty of my statue?”Richard chuckled in answer.Victor strode across the room, gesturing. “Come, sit with me and have somelardo.”In the failing light, they sat on the threshold, eating thin slices of the heavydelicacy, savoring the cool air coming up the hill.“You know, you don’t need to come here to look at my beautiful statue,” Victorsaid. “You have a beautiful wife to look at.”Richard didn’t say anything.“I never recalled you mentioning your wife. I never knew about her, until shecame to me that day. For some reason, I always believed you had a good woman . ..”Victor frowned off at the shell of the Retreat. “Why didn’t you ever mentionher?”Richard shrugged.“I hope you don’t think me a terrible person, Richard, but she just doesn’t fitmy idea of the woman I thought would be with you.”“I don’t think you’re a terrible person, Victor. Everybody should have the rightto think for themselves.”“Do you mind if I ask you about her?”Richard sighed. “Victor, I’m tired. I’d really rather not talk about my wife.Besides, there’s nothing-to say. She’s my wife. What is, is.”Victor grunted as he chewed a big bite of red onion. After he swallowed, hewaved the half of onion he had left. “It’s not good for a man to carve suchthings in the day, and then at night have to go home to-What am I saying! Whathas gotten into me? Forgive me, Richard. Nicci is a beautiful woman.”“Yes, I suppose so.”“And she cares for you.”Richard didn’t say anything.“Ishaq and I tried to get you out of that place by bargaining for you with yourgold. It wasn’t enough. The man was a pompous official. Nicci knew how towiggleworm him. She used her words to turn the key on your prison door. WithoutNicci, you would be buried in the sky.”“So, she told them that I could carve-to save my life.”“That’s right. It is she who got you the job of carver.”Victor waited for more, and finally sighed in resignation when it wasn’tforthcoming.“How are those chisels I sent down?”“Good. They work well. I could use a clawed chisel with finer teeth, though.”Victor handed Richard another small slice of lardo. “You will have it.”“What about the steel?”Victor waved his onion. “Not to worry. Ishaq is doing well in your place. Not asgood as you, but he is doing well. He gets me what I need. Everyone likes Ishaq,and is happy he decided to fill in the need. The Order is so desperate forprogress to continue that they turn a blind eye to his work. Faval the charcoalmaker asked about you. He likes Ishaq, but misses you.”Richard smiled at the memory of the nervous fellow. “I’m glad Ishaq is buyinghis charcoal.”There were a lot of good people in the Old World. Richard had always envisionedthem as the enemy, and now he was friends with a number of them. It had happenedto him so often and in the same way; people were basically the same everywhere,once you got to know them.There were those who loved liberty, who cried out to live their own lives, tostrive, to rise above, to achieve, and those bent on the mindless equality ofstagnation brought about through the enforcement of an artificial, arbitrary,gray uniformitythose who wanted to transcend through their own effort, and thosewho wanted others to think for them and were willing to pay the ultimate pricefor it.Kamil and Nabbi both stood and grinned when Richard climbed the steps.“Nabbi and I worked on our carving, Richard. Will you come and see?”Richard smiled and put an arm around Kamil’s shoulders. “Sure. Let’s see whatyou’ve done today.”Richard followed them down the clean hallway and out to the back, where Kamiland Nabbi had carved faces in an old log. The carvings were terrible.“Well, Kamil, it looks pretty good. Yours, too, Nabbi.”The carvings of the faces wore smiles, and to Richard that alone was priceless.Despite how poorly done, they had more life to them than what Richard sawexecuted day in and day out in precious marble by master carvers.“Really, Richard?” Nabbi asked. “You think Kamil and I could be carvers?”“Someday, maybe. You need more practice-you still have much to learn-but allcarvers have to practice to become adept. Here, look at this, right here, forexample. What do you think of this? What’s wrong with it?”Kamil folded his arms as he frowned in concentration at the face he’d carved. “Idon’t know.”“Nabbi?”Ill at ease, Nabbi shrugged. “It doesn’t look like a real face. But I can’t tellwhy.”“Look at my face, at my eyes. What’s different?”“Well, I think your eyes are a different shape,” Kamil said.“And they are closer together-not out at the side of the head,” Nabbi added.“Very good.” Richard smoothed some of the dirt where the carrots had been pulledup, and then molded the moist dirt into a mound. He used his finger and thumb toshape a simple face. “See here? By putting the eyes closer, like this, it looksmore like a real person.”Both young men nodded as they studied what he had done.“I see,” Kamil said. “I’ll start a new one, and do it better.”Richard clapped him on the back. “Good man.”“Maybe one day we can be carvers, too,” Nabbi said.“Maybe” was all Richard said.Nicci had dinner on the table, waiting for him. A bowl of soup sat next to theglowing lamp. The rest of the room was left to the evening gloom. Nicci, too,sat at the table waiting.“How was the carving today?” she asked as Richard went to the basin to wash thedirt from his hands.He splashed the soapy water on his face, rinsing off the stone dust.“Carving is carving.”Nicci rubbed her thumb on the base of the lamp.“Are you able to stand it?”Richard wiped his hands. “What choice have I? I can either stand it, or I canend it all. What choice is that? Are you asking me if I am ready to commitsuicide, yet?”She looked up. “That isn’t what I meant.”He tossed the towel down beside the basin. “Besides, how can I not be gratefulfor a job you got for me?”Nicci’s blue eyes turned back to the table. “Victor told you?”“It wasn’t all that hard to figure out. Victor said only that you werebeautiful, and you saved my life.”“I had no choice, Richard. They would only release you if you had a skill. I hadto tell them.”More than most days, he felt the essence of the engagement with her, the dance.She felt secure behind her shield of “had to tell them.” Yet it allowed her towatch him, to see how he would react.All the effort of the day, moving heavy stone blocks, lifting the hammercountless times, had sapped his strength. His hands tingled with the effect ofall those ringing blows. Now, he had begun yet again the battle with Nicci. Hesat down, on his pallet as exhaustion took him.Fatigue was part of any battle. As much as he ever felt it when he held theblade, he felt it now, that life-or-death dance. This was no less a battle thanany Richard had ever fought. Nicci stood in opposition to freedom, to life.This was a dance with death.The dance with death was really the definition of life itself, since all peopleeventually must die.“I want to know something, Nicci.”She gazed expectantly at him. “What is it?”“Can you tell if Kahlan is alive?”“Of course. I can feel the link to her at all times.”“And is she still alive, then?”Nicci smiled in that assuring manner of hers. “Richard, Kahlan is fine. Don’tlet that weigh on your mind.”Richard stared at Nicci for a time. Finally, he withdrew his gaze and lay downin his prison bed. He rolled away from Nicci’s gaze, from the dance.“Richard . . . I made you soup. Come eat.”“I’m not hungry.”He shut her from his mind and tried to remember Kahlan’s green eyes as wearinessengulfed him."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 58Richard could feel Neal’s breath on the back of his neck. The young disciplewatched over Richard’s shoulder as he tap-tap-tapped the back of the chisel,carving the gaping mouth of a sinner crying out in agony as his body was beingtorn apart by the Keeper of the Underworld.“Quite good,” Neal murmured, overcome with delight in what he was seeing.Richard rested the wrist of his chisel hand against the stone to help pushhimself upright. “Thank you, Brother Neal.”Neal’s brown eyes, the same color as his drab robes, stared with arrogantchallenge. Richard did nothing to meet that challenge.“You know, Richard, I don’t like you.”“No man is worth liking, Brother Neal.”“You always have an answer, don’t you, Richard?” The young wizard smiled then ashe reached under his hood and scratched his closely cropped brown hair. “Do youknow why you have this job?”“Because the Order gave me a chance to help-”“No, no,” Neal interrupted as he suddenly grew impatient. “I mean do you knowwhy the position was open? Do you know why we needed carvers, enabling you togain this great opportunity at employment?”Richard knew very well why they had needed carvers.“No, Brother Neal. I was a laborer, at the time.”“Many of them were put to death.”“Then they must have been traitors to our cause. I’m happy the Order caughtthem.”Neal’s sly smile returned as he shrugged. “Maybe. I could tell that they had abad attitude. They thought too much of themselves, of what they selfishlyconsidered their . . . talent. A very old-fashioned notion, don’t you think;Richard?”“I wouldn’t know, Brother Neal. I only know I am able to carve, and I amgrateful for the opportunity to do my duty to help my fellow man by contributingmy efforts.”Neal backed away, giving Richard an appraising look, as if to measure whether ornot the words had been mocking. Richard hadn’t given Neal the opening he wanted,so Neal simply spilled out his point.“I thought some among them might be deriding the Order with their work. Ithought they might be using their carving to mock and ridicule our noble cause.”“Really, Brother Neal? I never suspected.”“That is why you are nobody, and never will be anybody. You are a nothing. Justlike all those carvers.”“I realize I am nobody important, Brother Neal. It would be wrong to think I wasof any value other than in what I can contribute. I aspire only to work hard inservice to the Creator so I might earn my reward in the next life.”The smile was gone, replaced by a fiery scowl. “I ordered them put to deathafter I had confessions tortured out of each one of them.”Richard’s fist tightened on the chisel. Through a calm expression, hecontemplated driving his chisel through Neal’s skull. He knew he could do itbefore the man could react. But what would it gain? Nothing.“I am grateful, Brother Neal, that you uncovered the traitors in our midst.”Neal squinted in suspicion for a moment. He finally dismissed it with a twist ofhis mouth before suddenly swirling amid a flourish of his robes.“Come with me,” the brother commanded in a grave tone as he marched away.Richard followed him across the field churned to mud by all the workers goingback and forth, by all the supplies being dragged, carried, or rolled to theconstruction site. They strode, past what seemed the endless face of the palace.The stone walls were getting ever higher, with row upon row of window openings.Their trim was beginning to take form. Many of the beams for the second floorhad been placed in sockets in the walls. A maze of inner walls was going up,too, defining the interior rooms and hallways. There would be miles of corridorsin the palace. Dozens of stairwells stood in various stages of construction.It wouldn’t be long before oak floors were laid over some of the rooms below,enclosing them. The roof had to be completed over those sections, first, though,lest rain ruin the flooring. Some of the outer rooms were to have roofs lowerthan the main section, which was to rise up to a towering height. Richardexpected to see those lower rooms capped with slate and lead roofs before thewinter rains.He stayed close behind Brother Neal as they marched toward the main opening intothe palace. There, the walls were higher and more complete, with many of theornate decorations in place. Neal charged two at a time up the semicircle ofmarble steps leading up to the entry plaza. The white marble pillars stood in animpressive sweep, and over the top of them many of the stone carvings had beeninstalled. With all the tortured people frozen in stone, it was an intimidatingsight, as it was meant to be.The floor of the plaza was gray-veined white Cavatura marble. The sun on themarble made the plaza, half encircled by the soaring columns, glow with gloriouslight. The decrepit people in the stone ringing the plaza seemed to be screamingin pain at that light-which was just the effect Brother Narev had wanted.Neal made a sweeping gesture with an arm. “Here will be the great statue-thestatue to crown the entry to the emperor’s Retreat.” He turned a completerevolution while holding the arm aloft. “This will be the place where peopleenter the great palace. This is where people will come while on their way to seethe officials of the Order. This is where they will come closer to the Creator.”Richard said nothing. Neal watched him for a moment, then stood in the centerand threw his arms up toward the sunlight.“Here!-will be the statue to the glory of the Creator, using His Light in asundial. The Light will reveal the loathsome creatures of the statues-mankind.This will be a monument to man’s evil nature, doomed to the misery of hisexistence in this world, wicked of character, cowering in humiliation as HisLight reveals man’s hateful body and soul for what it is-perverted beyond hope.”Richard thought that if madness had a champion, it was the Order, and people whothought like them.Neal’s arms swept back down, a conductor concluding a triumphant performance.“You, Richard Cypher, are to carve this statue.”Richard was acutely aware of the hammer in his straining fist. “Yes, BrotherNeal.”Neal waggled a finger held close to his nose as he grinned with fiendishdelight. “I don’t think you understand, Richard.” He thrust up a commandinghand. “Wait. Wait right there.”He strode off, his brown robes swirling behind like muddy waters in a flood.Neal collected something from behind the marble pillars and returned holding itin one hand.It was a small statue. He set it down, where the radiating lines of the marblefloor converged at a point in the middle of the plaza. It was a plaster statueof what Brother Neal had just revealed to Richard. If anything, it was even moregruesome than Neal had described it. Richard ached to smash it with his hammer,right on the spot. It would almost be worth dying to destroy such a vile thing.Almost.“This is it,” Neal said. “Brother Narev had a master carver do up the model ofthe sundial to his instructions. Brother Narev’s vision is truly remarkable.It’s perfect, don’t you think?”“It is just as horrifying as you said it was, Brother Neal.”“And you are to carve it. Just scale this model up into a great statue in whitemarble.”Feeling numb, Richard nodded. “Yes, Brother Neal.”The finger waggled again with great delight. “No, no, you don’t yet reallyunderstand, Richard.” He was grinning like a washwoman standing at a fence withbasket full of dirty gossip. “You see, I did some checking on you. Brother Narevand I never trusted you, Richard Cypher. No, we never did. Now, we know allabout you. I found out your secret.”Richard’s flesh went cold. His muscles tightened as hard as stone. He preparedto throw himself into battle. There appeared to be no choice but to fight, now.Neal was about to die.“You see, I talked to People’s Protector Muksin.”Richard was taken aback. “Who?”Neal displayed a triumphant grin. “The man who sentenced you to work as acarver. He knew your name. He showed me the disposition of the case. Youconfessed to a civil infraction. He showed me the finetwenty-two gold marks.Quite a sum.” Neal waggled the finger again. “That was a miscarriage of justice,Richard, and you know it. No man can get. a fortune like that through a merecivil infraction. Such a gain can only be ill-gotten.”Richard relaxed a bit. His fingers ached from how hard he had been gripping thehammer.“No,” Neal said, “you had to have done something much more serious to havecollected a fortune of twenty-two gold marks. You are obviously guilty of a veryserious crime.”Neal spread his hands like the Creator before one of his children. “I am goingto show you mercy, Richard.”“Does Brother Narev approve of your showing mercy?”“Oh, yes. You see, the statue is to be your penance to the Order-your way toatone for your evil deed. You will create this statue when you are not doingyour other carving for the palace. You will receive no pay for it. You arecommanded not to steal any marble from that which the Order has purchased forthe emperor’s Retreat, but to procure the marble with your own money. If youhave to work for a decade to earn such a sum, all the better.” ‘“You mean, I am to carve, here, in the day, at my job, and I am to carve thisstatue for you on my own time, at night?”“Your own time? What a corrupt concept.”“When am I to sleep?”“Sleep is not the concern of the Order justice is.”Richard took a calming breath. He pointed with his hammer at the thing on theground.“And this is what I am to carve?”“That’s right. The stone will be purchased by you, and your labor will becontributed by you to the benefit of your fellow man. It will be your gift tothe people of the Order in penance for your evil deeds. Men like you, with theability, must happily contribute their all to help the Order.”Brother Neal swept his arm out. “There is to be a dedication of the palace, thiswinter. The people need to see tangible evidence that the Order can bring such agreat project as this magnificent palace to reality. They desperately need thelessons this palace will teach them.“Brother Narev is eager to dedicate the palace. He wishes to hold a greatceremony, this winter, which will be attended by many dignitaries of the Order.The war is progressing; the people need to see that their palace is, too. Theyneed to see results for their sacrifices.“You, Richard Cypher, are to carve the great statue for the entrance to theemperor’s Retreat.”“I am honored, Brother Neal.”Neal smirked. “You should be.”“What if I’m not . . . up to the task?”Neal’s smirk widened into a grin. “Then you will go back into custody, andProtector Muksin’s questioners will have you until you confess. After youfinally confess, you will be hung on a pole. The birds will feast on yourflesh.”Brother Neal pointed down at the grotesque model.“Pick it up. This is what you shall devote your life to.”Nicci looked up when she heard Richard’s voice. He was talking to Kamil andNabbi. She heard him say that he was tired and couldn’t look at their carving,that he would look tomorrow. Nicci knew they would be disappointed. That wasunlike Richard.She spooned buckwheat mush and peas from a dented pot into a bowl. She placedthe bowl and a wooden spoon on the table. There was no bread.She wished she could make something better for him, but after their voluntarycontributions were taken out, they had no money. If not for the garden the womenof the building had taken to planting in the back of the house, they would be indesperate straits. Nicci had learned how to grow things so she could have foodfor him.His shoulders were stooped, his eyes distant. He was carrying something in onehand.“I have your dinner. Come and eat.”Richard set the thing on the table, beside the oil lamp. It was a small,intricately carved statue of figures cowering in terror. They were partiallysurrounded by a section of a ring. A tall lightning bolt, a common symbol ofretribution by the Creator, came down in the center, piercing a number ofobviously evil men and women, pinning them to the ground. It was a staggeringrepresentation of the evil nature of mankind, and the Creator’s anger at theirwanton ways.“What’s this?” she asked.Richard slumped down into a chair. His face sank into his hands, his fingersstabbed back into his hair. After a time, he looked up.“What you wanted,” he said quietly.“What I wanted?”“My punishment.”“Punishment?”Richard nodded. “Brother Narev found out about the fine of twenty-two goldmarks. He said I must have done something criminal to get that much money, andhe sentenced me to make a statue for the grand entrance to the emperor’spalace.”Nicci glanced down at the small thing on the table. “What is it?”“A sundial. This is the ring with the times etched on it. The lightning boltcasts a shadow of the Creator’s Light on the ring to tell the time of day.”“I still don’t understand. Why is it a sentence? You are a carver. That is yourjob.”Richard shook his head. “I am to buy the stone out of my own money, and I am tocarve this at night, on my own time, as my gift to the Order.”“And why do you see this as what I wanted?”Richard ran a finger down the lightning bolt, his eyes studying the statue. “Youbrought me here, to the Old World, because you wanted me to learn the errors ofmy ways. I have. I should have confessed to a crime and let them end it.”Without thinking, Nicci reached across the table and put her hand over his. “No,Richard, that’s not what I wanted.”He pulled his hand away.Nicci pushed his bowl closer to him. “Eat, Richard. You need your strength.”Without complaint, he did as she told him. A prisoner, doing as ordered. Shehated to see him like this.The spark was gone from his eyes, just as it had left her father’s eyes.When he looked at the statue sitting in the center of their table, his eyes weredead. It was as if the life, the energy, the hope, was gone from him. When hewas finished with his meal, he went without a word to his bed and lay down,facing away from her.Nicci sat at the table, listening to the sputter of the lamp’s flame, watchingRichard’s even breathing as he went to sleep.It seemed his spirit was crushed. She had believed for so long that she wouldlearn something valuable when he was pushed to such extremes. It appeared shehad been wrong, that he had finally given up. She could learn nothing from him,now.There was little left for her to do. Little reason to continue the whole thing.For a moment, she felt the crushing weight of her disappointment; then even thatwas gone.Empty and unfeeling, Nicci collected the bowl and spoon and carried them to thewash bucket. She worked quietly, to let him sleep, as she resigned herself toreturning to Jagang.It wasn’t Richard’s fault he could teach her nothing; there was nothing more tolife to learn. This was all there was. Her mother had been right.Nicci took out the butcher knife and set it quietly on the table.Richard had suffered enough.It would be for the best."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 59Nicci sat at the table, the knife under her fingers, forever. She watched hisback. His chest slowly expanded with his breath of life, and sank again. Therewas time enough to slip the knife into his back, between his ribs, to pierce hisheart.There was time enough yet before dawn.Death was so final. She wanted to watch him for a while. Nicci never tired ofwatching Richard.After she did it, she wouldn’t be able to watch him anymore. He would be goneforever. With the damage the chimes had done to the worlds and theirinterconnection, she didn’t even know if a person’s soul could still go to thespirit world. She didn’t even know if the underworld still existed and ifRichard’s spirit would go there, or if he would simply be . . . gone forever-ifhe and that which was his soul would simply cease to exist.In her numb state, she had lost track of time.When she glanced out the window that Richard had had installed with the money hehad earned, she noticed that the sky had taken on a the color of a week-oldbruise.Linked as she was to Kahlan, Nicci couldn’t accomplish the deed with her magic.As much as she abhorred the idea of it, and knowing how gruesome it would be,she had to use the sharp blade.Nicci curled her fingers around the wooden handle of the stout knife. She wantedit to be quick. She couldn’t bear to think of him suffering. He had sufferedenough in life, she didn’t want him to suffer in death, too.He would struggle briefly, but then it would be over.Richard abruptly rolled onto his back and then sat up. Nicci froze, stillsitting in her chair. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Could she kill him whenhe was awake? Could she look into those eyes of his as she plunged the knifeinto his chest?She would have to.It was for the best.Richard yawned and stretched. He sprang to his feet.“Nicci. What are you doing? Haven’t you gone to bed?”“I . . . I guess I fell asleep in the chair.”“Oh, well, I-there it is. I need that.”He snatched the knife out of her hand. “Mind if I borrow this? I need to use it.I’m afraid I’ll have to sharpen it for you later. I won’t have time before Ihave to leave. Can you make me something to eat? I’m in a hurry. I have to gosee Victor before I start to work.”Nicci was dumbfounded. He was suddenly revived. In the lamplight, and the faintdawn coming in the windows, he had that look in his eyes. He looked . . .resolute, determined.“Yes, all right,” she said.“Thanks,” he called over his shoulder while hurrying out the door.“Where are you-?”But he was gone. She decided he must be going out back to get some vegetables.But why would he need the big knife for that? She was confused, but she wasrevived, too. Richard seemed himself again.Nicci pulled from the pantry some eggs she had been saving, along with an ironskillet, and hurried out back to the cooking hearth. The coals were stillglowing from the cook fires of the evening before, providing a little light. Shecarefully fed in some small twigs and kindling, then stacked a bed offinger-thick branches on top. She simply set the iron skillet atop the wood asit caught, rather than set up the rack-eggs were quick.As she waited for the skillet to get hot, she heard an odd scraping noise. Inthe flickering light of the fire, she didn’t see Richard in the garden. Shecouldn’t imagine where he had gone, or what he was up to. She broke the eggsinto the hot skillet and tossed the shells in the compost bucket at the side ofthe hearth. With a wooden spoon she scrambled the eggs around as they cooked.As Nicci stood, using her skirt to hold the hot handle of the skillet, she wassurprised to see Richard coming out from behind the broad cooking hearth.“Richard, what are you doing?”“There are some loose bricks back here. I was just seeing to it before I went towork. I cleaned out the joints. I’ll bring some mortar home and fix it later.”He pulled a handful of thick-bladed grass and used it as a potholder to take theskillet from her. With his other hand, he flipped the knife into the air, caughtit by the point, and held the handle out to her. Nicci took the heavy knife, nowscratched and dulled from scraping the bricks clean. He ate standing, using thewooden spoon.“Are you all right?” she asked.“Fine,” he said around a hot mouthful of eggs. “Why?”Nicci gestured toward the house. “Well, last night . . . you seemed so . . .defeated.”He frowned at her. “So, I’ve no right to feel sorry for myself now and again?”“Well, yes, I suppose. But now . . . ?”“Now I’ve thought it over.”“And . . . ?”“It’s to be my gift to the people, is it? I shall give the people a gift theyneed.”“What are you talking about?”Richard waved the wooden spoon. “Brothers Narev and Neal said this will be mygift to the people, and so it shall be.” He shoveled more eggs into his mouth.“So you are going to carve the statue they want?”He was already running up the stairs before she had finished the question.“I have to get the model of the statue and be off to work.”Nicci raced after him up the stairs. He was still eating the eggs as he went. Hestood in their room, peering down at the small statue on the table as hefinished the eggs. She couldn’t make sense of ithe was smiling.He set the skillet on the table and scooped up the model. “I’ll probably be homelate. I have to get started on my penance for the Order, if I can. I may have towork all night.”In astonishment, she watched him hurry off to work.She could hardly believe that he had once again somehow evaded death. Niccicouldn’t recall ever being so grateful about anything. She couldn’t understandit.Richard reached the blacksmith’s shop shortly after Victor had opened up for theday’s work. His men had not yet arrived. Victor wasn’t surprised to see him;Richard sometimes came early and the two of them would sit and watch the suncome up over the site.“Richard! I’m glad to see you.”“And I you, Victor. I need to talk to you.”He let out a gruff grunt. “The statue?”“That’s right,” Richard said, a little taken aback. “The statue. You know?”With Richard following behind, Victor made his way through the dark shop,weaving among the clutter of benches, work, and tools. “Oh, yes, I heard.” Alongthe way, he stooped to pick up a hammer here, a bar of iron there, and set themon a table, or shoved them in a bin, as if one could tidy a mountain byarranging a few pebbles and picking up a fallen limb.“What did you hear?”“Brother Narev paid me a visit last evening. He said there is to be a dedicationof the Retreat, to show our respect to the Creator for all he provides for us.”He glanced back over his shoulder as he strode past his huge block of Cavaturamarble. “He told me you are to carve a statue for the entrance plaza-a bigstatue. He said it is to be done for the dedication.“From what I hear from people, from Ishaq and others, the Order credits theuprising to the drain of building such a monumental project as the Retreat inaddition to waging the war. They have armies of men working for theconstruction-not just here, but from quarries far and wide, to mines for thegold and silver, to forests where they cut the wood. Even slaves must be fed.The purge of officials, leaders, and skilled workers after the uprising wasexpensive. With a dedication, I think Brother Narev wants to show people theprogress, to inspire them, to involve outlying lands in the celebration,believing this will head off further troubles.”In the blackness of the room, only the skylight in the high ceiling above letlight cascade down over the stone. The marble took the light deep into its finecrystalline structure, and gave it back as a loving gift.Victor opened the double doors that looked out over the Retreat. “Brother Narevtold me that your statue is also to be a sundial, with the Creator’s Lightshining down on mankind’s torment. He told me I am to oversee the making of thegnomon and dial plane for its shadow to fall upon. He said something about alightning bolt. . .”Victor turned around, his eyes following as Richard set the model of the statueon a narrow tool shelf that ran the length of the room.“Dear spirits . . .” Victor whispered. “That is grotesque.”“They want me to carve this. They want it to be a statue with the power todominate the grand entrance.”Victor nodded. “Brother Narev said as much. He told me how big would be themetal for the dial plane. He wants bronze.”“Can you cast the bronze?”“No.” With the backs of his fingers, Victor tapped Richard’s arm. “Here is thegood part: few people can cast such a piece. Brother Narev ordered Priskareleased to do the casting.”Richard blinked in astonishment. “Priska is alive?”Victor nodded. “High people must have not wanted him buried in the sky in casethey needed his skills. They had him locked away in a dungeon. The Order knowsthey need people with ability; they released him to get this done. If he wantsto remain alive, and out of the dungeon, he is to cast the bronze, at his ownexpense, as a gift to the people. They say it is his penance. I am to give himthe specifications and see to its assembly and placement on the statue.”“Victor, I want to buy your stone.”The blacksmith’s brow slid into an unfriendly frown.“No.”“Narev and Neal found out about my civil fine. They think I got off too lightly.They ordered that I carve their statue-much like Priska is to provide thecastingas my penance. I must buy the stone myself, and I must carve it after mywork at the site is finished for the day. They want it for this winter’sdedication of the Retreat.”Victor’s eyes turned toward the model on the shelf, as if it was some monstercome to visit ruin on him. “Richard, you know what this stone means to me. Iwon’t-”“Victor, listen to me.”“No.” He held his palm up toward Richard. “Don’t ask this of me. I don’t wantthis stone to become ugly, like all the Order touches. I won’t allow it.”“Neither will it”Victor gestured angrily at the model. “That is what you are to carve. How canyou even think of that ugliness visiting my pure marble?”“I can’t.”Richard set the plaster model on the floor. He picked up a large hammer, itshandle leaning against the wall, and with a mighty blow shattered theabomination into a thousand pieces. He stood as the white dust slowly billowedover the threshold, out the door, and down the hill toward the Retreat like someghost of evil returning to the underworld.“Victor, sell me your stone. Let me liberate the beauty inside.”Victor squinted his distrust. “The stone has a flaw. It can’t be carved.”“I’ve thought about it. I have a way. I know I can do it.”Victor put his hand to his stone, almost as if he were comforting a loved one indistress.“Victor, you know me. Have I ever done anything to betray you? To harm you?”His voice came softly. “No, Richard, you have not.”“Victor, I need this stone. It is the best piece of marble-the way it can takein light and send it back. It has grain that can hold detail. I need the bestfor this statue. I swear, Victor, if you trust me with it, I will be true toyour vision. I won’t betray your love of this stone, I swear.”The blacksmith gently ran his beefy, callused hand up the side of the whitemarble that towered to nearly twice his height.“What if you were to refuse to carve them their statue?”“Neal said that then they will take me back to the prison until they get aconfession out of me, or until I die from the questioning. I will be buried inthe sky in return for nothing.”“And if you do as you want, instead”-Victor gestured to the fragments of themodel-”and don’t carve them what they want?”“Maybe I would like to see beauty again before I die.”“Bah. What would you carve? What would you see before you die? What could beworth your life?”“Man’s nobility-the most sublime form of beauty.”The man’s hand paused on the stone, his eyes searching Richard’s, but he saidnothing.“Victor, I need you to help me. I’m not asking you to give me anything. I’mwilling to pay your price. Name it.”Victor returned his loving gaze to his stone.“Ten gold marks,” he said with bold confidence, knowing Richard had no money.Richard reached into his pocket and then counted out ten gold marks. He held thefortune out to Victor. The blacksmith frowned.“Where did you get such money?”“I worked and I saved it. I earned it helping the Order build their palace.Remember?”“But they took all your money. Nicci told them how much you had, and they tookit all.”Richard cocked his head. “You didn’t think I’d be foolish enough to put all mymoney in one place, did you? I have gold stashed all over. If this isn’t enough,I will pay you whatever you ask.”Richard knew that the stone was valuable, although not worth ten gold marks, butit was to Victor, so Richard would not argue the price. He would pay whateverthe man asked.“I can’t take your money, Richard.” He waved a hand in resignation. “I don’tknow how to carve. It was but a dream. As long as I never carved it, I coulddream of the beauty in the stone. This is from my homeland, where once there wasfreedom.” His fingers blindly found the wall of marble. “This is noble stone. Iwould like to see nobility in this Cavatura marble. You may have the stone, myfriend.”“No, Victor. I don’t want to take your dream. I want to, in a way, fulfill it. Icannot accept it as a gift. I want to buy it.”“But, why?”“Because I will have to give it to the Order. I don’t want you giving this tothe Order; I will have to do that. More than that, though, they will no doubtwant it destroyed. It must be mine when they do that. I want it to be paid for.”Victor held out his hand. “Ten marks, then.”Richard counted out the ten gold marks and then closed the man’s big fingersaround them.“Thank you, Victor,” Richard whispered.Victor grinned. “Where do you wish me to deliver it?”Richard held out another gold mark. “May I rent this room? I would like to carveit here. From here, when I’m done, it can be sledged down to the entranceplaza.”Victor shrugged. “Done.”Richard handed over a twelfth gold mark. “And I want you to make me the toolswith which I will carve this stone-the finest tools you have ever made. The kindof tools used to carve beauty in your homeland. This marble demands the best.Make the tools out of the best steel.”“Points, toothed chisels, and chisels for fine work-I can make them for you.There are hammers aplenty about you may use.”“I also need rasps, in a variety of shapes. And files, too. Straight, curved-awide selection-the finest smoothing files. I need you to get me pumice stones,the fine white close-grained pumice--ground to the same shapes to match therasps and files, and a good supply of powdered pumice, too.”Victor’s eyes had gone wide. The blacksmith had come from a place where they hadonce done such carving. He knew full well what it was Richard meant to do.“You intend to do flesh in stone?”“I do.”“You know how?”Richard knew from statues he had seen in D’Hara and in Aydindril, and from whatsome of the other carvers told him, and from his own tests in his work for theOrder’s palace, that if carved properly, then smoothed and polished to a highluster, quality marble could take in the light and give it back in a way thatseemed to liberate the stone from its hardness, softening it, so that it assumedthe look of flesh. If done properly, the marble could seem to almost come alive.“I’ve seen it done before, Victor. I’ve carved before. I’ve learned how to doit. I’ve thought about it for months. Ever since I started carving for them,this purpose has kept my mind alive. I’ve used my work for the Order to practicewhat I’ve seen, what I’ve learned, and what I’ve thought of on my own. Evenbefore, when they questioned me . . . I thought about this stone, about thestatue I know is in it, to keep my mind from what they did to me.”“You mean it helped you to endure their torture?”Richard nodded. “I can do it, Victor.” He lifted a fist in firm conviction.“Flesh in stone. I only need the proper tools.”Victor rattled the gold in his fist. “Done. I can make the proper tools for whatyou want to do. This is what I know. I don’t know how to carve, but this will bemy part-what I can do to bring the beauty out.”Richard clasped forearms with Victor to seal their agreement.“I have one thing I would ask you-as a favor.”Victor laughed his deep belly laugh. “I must feed you lardo so you may have thestrength to carve this noble stone?”Richard smiled. “I wouldn’t ever turn down lardo.”“What is it then?” Victor asked. “What is the favor?”Richard’s fingers tenderly touched the stone. His stone.“No one is to see it until it is done. That includes you. I would like to have acanvas tarp, so I can cover it. I would ask that you not look at it until it isdone.”“Why?”“Because I need it to be mine alone while I carve it. I need solitude with it asI shape it. When I’m finished, then the world can have it, but when I work onit, it is to be my vision and mine alone. I wish no one to see it before it isfinished.“But most of all, I don’t want you to see it because if anything goes wrong, Idon’t want you involved in this. I don’t want you to know what I do. If youdon’t see it, you can’t be buried in the sky for not telling them.”Victor shrugged. “If that is your wish, then it shall be so. I will tell the menthat the back room is rented, and it is off-limits. I will put a lock on theinner door. I will put a chain on the outer double doors, here, and give you thekey.”“Thank you. You don’t know what that means to me.”“When do you need the chisels?”“I need the heavy point to rough it out, first. Can you have it done by tonight?I need to get started. There isn’t much time.”Victor dismissed Richard’s concern with a flourish of his hand. “The heavy pointis easy. I can make that in short order. It will be done when you come from yourwork down there-your work with the ugliness. Long before you need the otherchisels, they will be ready for you to carve beauty.”“Thank you, Victor.”“What is this `thank you’ talk? This is business. You have paid me in advancevalue for value between honest men. I can’t tell you how good it is to have acustomer other than the Order.”Victor scratched his head and turned more serious. “Richard, they will want tosee your work, won’t they? They will want to see how you are doing on theirstatue.”“I don’t think so. They trust my work. They gave me the model they want scaledup. They have already approved it. They’ve told me my life depends on this. Nealdelighted in telling me how he ordered those other carvers tortured and put todeath. He wanted to frighten me. I doubt they will give it a second thought.”“But what if a Brother does come, wanting to see it?”“Then I will have to bend an iron bar around his neck and let him pickle in thebrine barrel.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 60Richard touched the length of the point chisel to his forehead, as he had sooften touched the Sword of Truth there in much the same way. This was no less abattle. This was life and death.“Blade, be true this day,” he whispered.The chisel had eight sides, so as to provide grip in a sweaty hand. Victor hadgiven it a proper heavy blunt point. He had also put his initials-V C-in smallletters on one of the facets, proclaiming the pride of its maker.Such a heavy chisel would shatter stone and remove a great excess material inshort order. It was a weapon that would do a lot of damage, fracturing thestructure of the marble down the width of three fingers. A point used carelesslyon unnoticed flaws could shatter the entire piece.Finer points would cause shallower fractures, but remove less material. Evenwith the finest point punches, Richard knew that he could only approach towithin the last half finger of the final layer. The network of spidery cracksleft by a point were fractures in the crystalline structure of the marbleitself. So damaged, the stone lost its translucence and its ability to take ahigh polish.To do flesh in stone, the final layers had to be approached with care, and beleft undamaged by any tool.After the heavy point removed much of the waste, then finer-point chisels wouldallow Richard to get closer, refining the shape. Once he was within as close asa half finger of the final layer, he would turn to the clawed chisels, simplychisels with notches in their edge, to shear away the stone without fracturingthe underlying structure of the marble. The coarse claws took off the moststone, leaving rough gouges. He would use chisels with a series of finer andfiner teeth to refine the work. Finally, he would use smooth-bladed chisels,some only half as wide as his little finger.Down at the site, where he carved scenes for the frieze, that was as far as thecarvers went. It left an ugly surface, ungainly and coarse, rendering flesh aswooden, leaving no definition or refinement to muscle and bone. It robbed thepeople in the carvings of their humanity.On this statue, Richard would really only begin where the carvings for the Orderended. He would use rasps to define bone, muscle, even veins in the arms. Finefiles would remove the marks left by the rasps and refine the most subtlecontours. The pumice stones would remove the filing marks, leaving the surfaceready to polish with pumice paste held in leather, cloth, and finally straw.If he did it right, he would have his vision in stone. Flesh in stone. Nobility.Holding the heavy point chisel to his palm with his thumb, Richard put his handto the stone, feeling its cool surface. He knew what was inside-inside not onlythe stone, but inside himself.There were no doubts, only the heart-pounding passion of expectation.As he so often did, Richard thought of Kahlan. It had been nearly a year sincehe had looked into her green eyes, touched her cheek, held her in his arms. Shewould have long ago left the safety of their home for dangers he could vividlyimagine. For a moment, he was overwhelmed with the weight of despair, choked bythe sadness of how much he missed her, humbled at how much he loved her. Now heknew he must dismiss her from his mind so that he could devote himself entirelyto the task he had to do.As he so often did, Richard said his silent good-night to Kahlan.Then he set the point at ninety degrees to the face of the stone, and took apowerful swing with the steel club. Stone chips exploded away.His breaths came deeper and faster. It was begun.With great violence, Richard attacked the stone.By the light of lamps Victor left for him after the work day was done, Richardlost himself in the work, raining down blow upon blow. Sharp stone chips rattledoff the wooden walls, and stung when they hit his arms or chest. With a clearvision of what he wanted to do, he broke away the waste stone.His ears rang with the sound of steel on steel and steel on stone. It was music.Jagged chips and chunks fell away. They were the fallen enemy. The air boiledwith the white dust of battle.Richard knew precisely what we wanted to accomplish. He knew what needed to bedone, and how to do it. He was filled with a clarity of purpose, a course tofollow. Now that it had begun, he was lost in the work.Dust billowed up around him until his dark clothes were white, as if the stonewere absorbing him, as he was transforming with it, until they were one. Sharpshards nicked him as they shot away. His bare arms, white as the marble itself,were soon streaked here and there with blood from the battle.From time to time, he opened the doors to shovel out the ankle-deep scree. Thewhite scrap avalanched down the hill, tinkling with a sound like a thousand tinybells. The white dust covering him was cut through with dark rivulets of sweat,and red scratches. The cool air felt refreshing against his sweat-soaked skin.But then he once again shut out the night, shut out the world to be alone.For the first time in nearly a year, Richard felt free. In this, he was incomplete control. No one watched him. No one told him what he must do.This work was his singular purpose, in which he strove for perfection. Therewere no chains, no limitations, no desires of others to which he must bow. Inthis struggle to accomplish his best, he was utterly free.What he intended would stand in unyielding opposition to everything the Orderrepresented. He intended to show them life.Richard knew that when the Brothers saw the statue, they would sentence him todeath.Stone chips burst forth with each blow, taking him closer to his goal. He had tostand on a work stool to reach the top of the marble, moving it around themonolith to work all sides, narrowing it down to what would be.Richard swung the steel club with the fury of battle. His chisel hand stung withthe ringing blows. As violent as the attack was, though, it was controlled. Atrimming hammer, called a pitcher, could be used for such rough work. It removedwaste with greater speed than a heavy point to shape the block, but it was usedwith a full swing, and Richard feared, because of the flaw, to unleash that muchpower against the stone. In the beginning, the block had strength in its sheermass, but even so, he considered such a trimming hammer too dangerous for thisparticular stone.Richard would have Victor make him a set of drill bits for a bow drill. With abow’s cord run around the shaft of the drill, it could be twisted and driventhrough the marble. Richard had thought long and hard about the problem of theflaw. He had resolved to cut out most of it. First, to stop any further cracksfrom running through more of the stone, he would drill holes through the crackto relieve the stress. With another series of closely spaced holes, he wouldweaken the stone in a waste area around the flaw and simply remove most of it.There would be two figures: a man, and a woman. When finished, the space betweenthem would be where Richard had removed the worst of the flaw. With the weakeststone removed, the sound stone that remained would be strong enough to take thestress of the work. Since the defect started at the base, he couldn’t eliminateit all, but he could reduce the problem it presented to a manageable level. Thatwas the secret to this piece of stone: eliminating its weakness, then working inits strength.Richard considered it a fortunate flaw, first of all because it had reduced thevalue of the stone, enabling Victor to purchase it in the first place. ToRichard’s mind, though, the flaw had been valuable because it had caused him tothink about the stone, and how to carve it. That thought had brought him to hisdesign. Without the flaw, he might not have come to the same design.As he worked, he was filled with the energy of the fight, driven onward by theheat of the attack. Stone stood between him and what he wanted to carve, and hecraved to eliminate that excess so he could get to the essence of the figures. Ahuge corner of waste broke loose, slipping away, slowly at first, then crashingdown. Chips and shards rained down as he worked, burying the fallen foe.Several more times he had to open the doors and shovel out the scrap. It wasinvigorating to see what was once an irregular shaped block, becoming a roughshape. The figures were still completely encased, their arms far from beingfree, their legs not separate, yet, but they were beginning to emerge. He wouldhave to be careful, drilling holes in the open areas to prevent breaking off thearms.Richard was surprised to see light streaming through the window overhead. He hadworked the entire night without realizing it.He stood back and appraised the statue that was now more or less roughly a coneshape. Now, there were only lumps where the arms would extend out from thebodies. He wanted the arms to be free, the bodies to convey grace and movement.Life. What he carved for the Order was never free, always tightly bound to thestone, forever stiff, unable to move, like cadavers.Half of what had been there the night before was now gone. Richard ached to stayand work on, but he knew he couldn’t. From the corner, he excavated the canvastarp Victor had left for him, and flung it over the statue.When he threw open the door, the white dust billowed out. Victor was sittingamong the rubble of his stone monolith.The blacksmith blinked. “Richard, you have been here the whole night!”“I guess I have.”He gestured as a grin split his face. “You look like a good spirit. How goes thebattle with the stone?”Richard could think of nothing to say. He could only beam with the joy of it.Victor laughed his belly laugh. “Your face says it all. You must be tired andhungry. Come, sit and rest-have some lardo.”Nicci heard Kamil and Nabbi shout a greeting as Richard came down the street,and then their footsteps as they ran down the front stairs. She glanced out thefront window and, in the failing light of dusk, saw them meet up with Richard ashe came down the street. She, too, was happy to see him coming home this early.Nicci had seen precious little of Richard in the weeks since he took on the dutyof carving the statue for Brother Narev. She couldn’t imagine how Richard couldendure carving a statue she knew had to be agony for him-not so much because ofits size, but because of its nature.If anything, though, Richard seemed invigorated. Often, after working all daycarving the moral lessons for the facade of the palace, he would then work lateinto the night on the grand statue for the entrance plaza. As tired as he had tobe when he came home, he would sometimes pace. There were nights when he wouldonly sleep for a couple of hours, rise, and go to work on the statue for hoursbefore his workday at the site began. Several times he had worked the entirenight.Richard seemed driven. Nicci didn’t know how he could do it. He sometimes camehome to eat and to take a nap for an hour, and then he would go back. She wouldurge him to stay and sleep, but he would say that the penance had to be paid orthey would put him back in prison. Nicci feared that possibility, so she didn’tinsist that he stay home to sleep. Losing sleep was preferable to him losing hislife.He had always been muscular and strong, but his muscles had become even morelean and defined since he came to the Old World. All that labor of loading ironand now moving rock and swinging a hammer had built him up even more. When hewent out back to the washtubs and removed his shirt to rinse off the stone dust,the sight of him made her knees weak.Nicci heard footsteps passing down the hallway, and the excited voices of Kamiland Nabbi asking questions. She couldn’t understand Richard’s words, but sheeasily recognized the timbre of his voice calmly giving the two the answers totheir questions.As tired as he was, as much as he was away at his work, he still took time totalk to Kamil and Nabbi, and to the people of the building. He was no doubt nowon his way out back to give pointers to the two young men on their carving.During the day, they worked around the building, cleaning and caring for theplace. They turned over the dirt in the garden, mixing in compost when it wasready. The women appreciated having the heavy spade work done for them. The twowashed, painted, and repaired, hoping Richard would approve and then show themhow to do new things. Kamil and Nabbi always offered to help Nicci with anythingshe might need-she was, after all, Richard’s wife.Richard came in the door as Nicci stood at the table cutting up carrots andonions into a pot. He slumped down into the chair across the table. He lookedspent from his day of work-after having been up hours earlier working on thestatue.“I came home to get something to eat. I have to go back and work on the statue.”“This is for tomorrow’s stew. I have some millet cooked.”“Is there anything more in it?”She shook her head. “I only had enough money for the millet today.”He nodded without complaint.Despite how exhausted he looked, there was some remarkable quality in his eyes,some inner passion, that made her pulse race faster. Whatever it was that shehad seen in him from the first moment seemed to have only gotten stronger sincethat night she had almost put the knife through his heart.“Tomorrow, we’ll have this stew.” she said. His gray eyes were staring off intohis private visions. “From the garden.”She retrieved the cook pot after setting a wooden bowl on the table before himand spooned millet into his bowl until it was full. There was little left, buthe needed it more than she. She had spent the morning waiting in line for themillet, and then had spent the afternoon picking all the worms out of it. Someof the women just cooked it until you couldn’t tell. Nicci didn’t like to feedthat to Richard.Standing close to-the table, cutting up carrots, she could finally stand it nomore. “Richard, I want to come to the site with you and see this statue thatyou’re carving for the Order.”He was silent for a moment as he chewed and then swallowed. When he finally didspeak, it was with a quiet quality that matched that inexplicable look in hiseyes.“I want you to see the statue, Nicci-I want everyone to see it. But not untilI’m finished.”“Why?”He stirred his spoon around in his bowl. “Please, Nicci, will you grant me this?Let me finish it, then you will see it.”Her heart pounded against her ribs. This was important to him.“You aren’t carving what they told you to carve, are you?”Richard’s face turned up until his gaze met hers.“No, I’m not. I’m carving what I need to carve, what people need to see.”Nicci swallowed. She knew: this was what she had been waiting for. He had beenready to give up, then he wanted to live, and now he was willing to die forthis.Nicci nodded, having to look away from those gray eyes of his. “I’ll wait untilit’s ready.”Now she knew why he seemed so driven, lately. That quality hinted at in herfather’s eyes, and blazing in Richard’s, she felt was somehow tied to this. Thevery idea was intoxicating.In more ways than one, this was a matter of life and death.“Are you sure about this, Richard?”“I am.”She nodded again. “All right, I will honor your request.”The next day, Nicci got an early start to buy bread. She wanted Richard to havebread with the stew she was cooking. Kamil offered to go for her, but she wantedto get out of the house. She asked him to keep an eye on Richard’s stew as itsimmered on the banked coals.It was an overcast day, and cool-a hint of the rapidly approaching winter. Thestreets were crowded with people out looking for work, with carts haulingeverything from manure to bolts of coarse dark cloth, and with wagons, mostlycarrying building materials for the palace. She had to step carefully to avoidthe dung in the road and squeeze between all the people moving as slowly as thesludge of the open sewers as she made her way through the city.There were crowds of needy people in the street, many come to Altur’Rang forwork, no doubt, although there were few people at the workers’ group hall. Thelines at the bakeries were long. At least the Order saw to it that people gotbread, even if it was gray, tough bread. You had to go early, though, beforethey ran out. With more people all the time, the shops ran out earlier everyweek.Someday, it was rumored, they were going to be able to provide more than onekind of bread. She hoped that this day, at least, they might have some butter,too. Sometimes, they sold butter. The bread, and the butter, were inexpensive,so she knew she could afford to buy a little for Richard-if they had any. Theyalmost never had any butter.Nicci had spent a hundred and eighty years trying to help people, and peopleseemed no better off now than they ever were. Those in the New World wereprosperous enough, though. Someday, when the Order ruled the world, and thosewith the means were made to contribute their fair share to their fellow man,then everything would finally fall into place and all of mankind could at lastlive with the dignity they deserved. The Order would see to it.The bread shop stood at an intersection of two roads, so the line turned aroundthe corner onto another street. Nicci was around that corner, leaning a shoulderagainst the wall, watching the passing throngs, when a face in the crowd caughther attention.Her eyes went wide as she straightened. She could hardly believe what she wasseeing. What was she doing in Altur’Rang?Nicci didn’t really want to find out-not now, when it seemed she was gettingclose to finding her answers. Matters seemed to be at a critical state withRichard. She felt sure that it would soon come to resolution.Nicci flipped her dark shawl up over her head of blond hair and tied it snugunder her chin. She sank back behind a wide woman and hugged the wall as shepeeked out between the people in line.Nicci watched Sister Alessandra, her nose held high as her calculating gazeswept the faces of all the people on the street. She looked like a mountain lionon the prowl.Nicci knew who Alessandra was hunting.Ordinarily, Nicci would have been only too happy to cross paths with the woman,but not now.Nicci sank back against the rough clapboards, staying low behind the peopleahead of her, until Sister Alessandra had vanished into the vast sea of peoplecrowding the street."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 61As Kahlan rode out of her home city of Aydindril for the last time, she pulledher wolf-fur mantle up over her shoulders for protection against the bitterwind. She recalled that the last, time the weather had been about to close infor the winter was the last time she had seen Richard. With the world in suchconstant turmoil and the battle burning hot, her thoughts, by necessity, alwaysseemed to be on urgent matters. The unexpected memory of Richard was a welcome,if bittersweet, respite from the worries of war.She took a last look before cresting the hill, to see the splendor of theConfessors’ Palace on the distant rise. It made her ache with the sense of homewhenever she saw the soaring white marble columns and rows of tall windows.Other people were stricken with awe or fear at the sight of the palace, butKahlan’s heart was always warmed by it. She had grown up there, and it was aplace of many happy memories for her.“It won’t be forever, Kahlan.”Kahlan glanced over at Verna. “No, it won’t.”She wished she could believe that.“Besides,” Verna said, offering a smile, “we will be denying the Imperial Orderthe people, and that is what they are really after. The rest is just stone andwood. What matters stone and wood, if the people are safe?”Kahlan, despite her desolate tears, was overcome with a smile. “You’re right,Verna. That really is all that matters. Thank you for reminding me.”“Don’t worry, Mother Confessor,” Cara said, “Berdine and the rest of theMordSith, along with the troops, will watch over the people and see them safelyto D’Hara.”Kahlan’s smile widened. “I wish I could see Jagang’s face when he finally getshere next spring to be greeted by ghosts.”The season of war was drawing to an end. If the summer with Richard in theirmountain home had been a wonderful dream, then the summer of endless warfare hadbeen a nightmare.The fighting had been desperate, intense, and bloody. There were times whenKahlan thought she and the army could not go on, that they were finished. Eachof those times, they had managed to pull through. There were occasions when shealmost welcomed death, just to have the nightmare end, just to stop seeingpeople in agony and pain, to stop seeing all the precious lives in ruins.Against the seemingly indomitable millions of the Imperial Order, the forces ofthe D’Haran Empire had managed to slow the enemy enough to keep them from takingAydindril this year. With thousands of lives lost in the fighting, they hadbought the hundreds of thousands of people of Aydindril and other cities thatlay along the path of the Order the time they needed to escape.As autumn had turned bitter, the immense force of the Imperial Order had reacheda broad valley at a convergence of the Kern River and a large tributary, wherethe lay of the land provided space to accommodate their entire force. Withwinter closing in, Jagang knew better than to be caught unprepared. They had dugin while they had the opportunity. The D’Haran forces had set up their defensivelines to the north, bulwarking the way to Aydindril.Just as Warren had forecast, Aydindril was more than Jagang’s army could take inthis season of war. Jagang, once again, had proven his prudent patience; he hadchosen to preserve the viability of his army so he would be able to press onsuccessfully when conditions allowed. In the short run, it gave Kahlan and herforces breathing room, but in the long run, it would spell their doom.Kahlan felt sweet relief that Warren’s prediction, of Aydindril falling thefollowing year, at least would not be at the cost of a slaughter of the city’scitizens. She didn’t know what hardships the people would have to endureescaping to D’Hara, but it was better than the certain slavery and widespreaddeath of remaining behind in Aydindril.Some people, she knew, would refuse to leave. In cities along the Order’s marchup the Midlands, some people put their faith in “Jagang the Just.” Some peoplebelieved that the good spirits, or the Creator, would watch over them no matterwhat. Kahlan knew they couldn’t save everyone from themselves. Those who wishedto live, and were willing to see reason, stood a chance. Those who saw only whatthey wished to see, would, at the least, fall under the pall of the Order’sdomination.Kahlan reached back and touched the hilt of the Sword of Truth sticking upbehind her shoulder. It was comforting, sometimes, to touch it. The Confessors’Palace was no longer her home. Home was wherever Richard and she were together.The fighting was often so intense, the fear so palpable, that there weretimesdays at a stretch-when she never thought of him. Sometimes, she had todevote all her physical and mental effort to just staying alive one more day.Some men, feeling the war was hopeless, had deserted. Kahlan could understandthe way they felt. All they ever did, it seemed, was to fight for their livesagainst overwhelming odds as they backed their way up through the Midlands.Galea had fallen. That there was no word from any city in Galea probably said itall.They had lost Kelton, too. Many of the Keltans in Winstead, Penverro, and othercities had fled, first. Most of Kelton’s army were still with them, though somehad rushed home in desperation.Kahlan tried not to think too long on everything that had gone wrong, lest shegive up. They had saved a good many people-gotten them out of the way of theOrder. At least for the time being. It was the best they could do.Along the long retreat north, tens of thousands of their joint forces had losttheir lives in the fierce battles. The Order had lost many times that number. Inthe high summer heat, the Order had lost a quarter million men to fever alone.It made little difference; they continued to grow and to roll onward.Kahlan recalled the things Richard had told her, that they could not win, thatthe New World was going to fall to the Order, and if they resisted, it wouldonly cause greater bloodshed. She was reluctantly coming to understand thathopeless outlook.She feared she was only getting people killed to no good end. Yet giving upstill was out of the question for her.Kahlan looked over her shoulder, past the long column of men escorting her, pastthe trees and up the mountain, to the great dark mass of the Wizard’s Keeplooming up on the mountain overlooking Aydindril.Zedd would have to go there; they could not stop the Imperial Order from havingAydindril, but they dared not let them have the Keep.It was dusk, ten days later, when Kahlan and her company rode back into theD’Haran camp. It was obvious from the first instant that something was wrong.Men were running through camp, swords drawn. Others were rushing pole weapons tothe barricades. Men were donning leather and chain mail as they ran to theirposts. It was a tense scene, but one Kahlan had seen repeated so often that itseemed almost routine.“I wonder what this is all about,” Verna said with a scowl. “I’ll not like it ifJagang spoils my dinner.”Kahlan, not wearing her leather armor, suddenly felt naked. It was uncomfortableto wear on long rides, so, going through friendly territory, she had tied it toher saddle. Cara moved close as they dismounted. They handed the reins tosoldiers as men closed in protectively.Kahlan couldn’t remember what color cloth would be used to mark the commandtents. She had lost track of the exact number of days she had been gone. It hadbeen somewhat over a month. She took the arm of an officer among the men who hadswept in around her.“Where are the commanders?”He pointed with his sword. “Down that way, Mother Confessor.”“Do you know what’s going on?”“No, Mother Confessor. The alarm sounded. As a Sister rushed past, I heard hersay it was genuine.”“Do you know where my Sisters, or Warren, are?” Verna asked the officer.“I’ve seen Sisters running around everywhere, Prelate. I’ve not seen WizardWarren.”Darkness was settling in, leaving only the fires to guide them through camp.Most of the fires, though, had been doused at the alarm, so the camp wasbecoming a black maze.Horses with D’Haran riders flashed past, headed out on patrol. Foot soldiersraced out of camp to scout. No one seemed to know what the threat was, but thatwasn’t unusual. Besides being frequent and varied, attacks were usuallyconfusing, in addition to being frightening.It was over an hour before Kahlan, Cara, Verna, and their heavy ring of guardsmade it through the sprawling camp that was the size of a city, to the officers’tents. None of the officers were there.“This is a foolish way to go about it,” Kahlan muttered. She found her tent,with Spirit standing on the little table, and tossed her saddlebags inside,along with her armor. “Let’s just wait here so people can find us.”“I agree,” Verna said.Kahlan gestured to include a number of the group of men who had set up adefensive guard around her. “Spread out and find the officers. Tell them thatthe Mother Confessor and the Prelate are at the command tents. We’ll wait herefor reports.”“Tell any Sisters you see,” Verna added. “And if you see Warren or Zedd, tellthem, too, that we’ve returned.”The men raced off into the night to carry out their instructions.“I don’t like this,” Cara muttered.“I don’t, either,” Kahlan said as she stepped into her tent.Cara stood guard, along with a small army of men, as Kahlan took off her furmantle and slipped on her leather armor. It had saved her from taking woundsoften enough that she was not shy about wearing it. All it would take was oneman to slip up close and thrust a sword into her, and that might well be theend. If she got lucky, and they ran it through a leg, or even her belly, she hada chance of being healed by a Sister, but if it was in some other place-heart,head, some major artery so that the loss of blood was too fast-then even thegifted wouldn’t be able to heal her.The leather was extremely tough, and while not impervious to blades, spears, orarrows, it afforded a good degree of protection while allowing enough freedom ofmovement to enable her to fight. A blow with a blade had to be landed justright, or it would glance harmlessly off the leather. Many of the men wore chainmail, which afforded better protection, but it was too heavy for Kahlan to bepractical for her to wear. In combat, speed and maneuverability were life.Kahlan knew better than to risk her life needlessly. She was more valuable totheir cause in her capacity as a leader than as a combatant. Still, while sherarely went directly into combat, the fighting had often enough come to her.A sergeant finally arrived to give her a report.“Assassins” was all he said.That one chilling word was enough. It was what she had figured, and explainedthe state of the camp.“How many casualties?” Kahlan asked.“I only know for sure that one attacked Captain Zimmer. He was eating at acampfire with his men. The captain managed to miss a killing blow, but took anasty wound in the leg. He’s lost a lot of blood. The surgeons are seeing to himright now.”“What about the assassin?” Verna asked.The sergeant looked surprised at the question. “Commander Zimmer killed theassassin.” He screwed up his face with the distaste of the rest of what he hadto say. “The assassin was dressed in a D’Haran uniform. He walked through thecamp without notice until he found a target-Captain Zimmer-and attacked.”Verna let out a worried breath. “A Sister might be able help the captain.”Kahlan dismissed him with a nod. The sergeant saluted with a fist to his heartbefore rushing off to his duties.It was then that Kahlan spotted Zedd approaching. The front of his robes was wetand darkundoubtedly with blood. Tears ran down his face. Gooseflesh tingled upKahlan’s arms and legs.Verna gasped when Zedd suddenly saw her and for an instant faltered beforerushing toward them. Verna clutched Kahlan’s arm.Zedd seized Verna’s hand. “Hurry” was all he said.It was all he needed to say; they all understood.Verna let out a mournful cry as she was pulled along after the old wizard.Kahlan and Cara ran behind as Zedd led them on a winding charge through theconfusion of shouting men, galloping horses, squads in formation dashing inevery direction, and unit officers taking roll call.The roll call was needed because the assassins were in D’Haran uniforms so theycould sneak up close to their quarry. It was necessary to account for every manin order to single out those who didn’t belong. It was tedious and difficult,but essential.They rushed into the swirl of turmoil around the tents where wounded men werebeing treated. Men shouted orders as others brought in men crying out in pain,or men with their limp arms dragging the ground. Each tent could hold up to tenor twelve men.Verna’s composure was frayed with panic. Zedd stopped her, holding her by herarms. His voice was choked with his emotion.“A man stabbed Holly. Warren was nearby and tried to protect the girl. Verna, Iswear to you on my dead wife’s soul . . . I did everything I could do. Dearspirits forgive me, but I must be the one to tell you . . . he is beyond mypower to help him. He asked for you and Kahlan.”Kahlan stood in a stupor, her heart in her throat. Zedd’s hand on her back urgedher to move quickly. She followed Verna, ducking into the tent.Half a dozen dead men lay at the far end of the tent, covered with blankets.Here and there a bloody hand stuck out from under a cover. One man was missing aboot. Kahlan stared, unable to make her mind work, unable to understand how thesoldier had lost a boot. It seemed so silly-dying and losing a boot. Tragedy andcomedy together under a shroud.Warren lay on his back on a pallet on the ground. Sister Philippa was on the farside of him, her tall frame bent over the youthful wizard, holding his hand.Sister Phoebe was on the near side, holding his other hand. Both women turnedtearstained faces up to see Verna above them.“Warren,” Sister Philippa said, “it’s Verna. She’s here. And Kahlan, too.”The two Sisters quickly moved out of the way for Verna and Kahlan to take theirplaces. They covered their mouths to hold in their cries as they fled the tent.Warren was as white as the stacks of clean bandages lying nearby. His eyes wereopen wide as he stared up . . . as if he could no longer see. His curly blondhair was matted in sweat. His robes were soaked in blood.“Warren,” Verna moaned. “Oh, Warren.”“Verna? Kahlan?” he asked in a breathy whisper.“Yes, my love.” Verna kissed his hand a dozen times.Kahlan squeezed his other limp hand. “I’m here, too, Warren.”“I had to hold on. Till you both came back. To tell you both.”“Tell us what, Warren?” Verna asked through her tears.“Kahlan . . .” he whispered.She leaned in. “I’m here, Warren. Don’t try to talk, just-”“Listen to me.”Kahlan pressed his hand to her cheek. “I’m listening, Warren.”“Richard is right. His vision. I had to tell you.”Kahlan didn’t know what to say.A smile came to his ashen face. “Verna. . .”“What is it, my love?”“I love you. Always have.”Verna could hardly get her words past her choking tears. “Warren, don’t die.Don’t die. Please don’t die.”“Give me a kiss,” Warren whispered, “while I still live. And don’t mourn whatends, but what a good life we’ve had. Kiss me, my love.”Verna bent over him and met his lips with hers, giving him a gentle, loving kissas her tears dripped onto his face.Unable to bear the scene, Kahlan staggered out of the tent, finding Zedd’sprotective arms waiting. She hid her weeping against his shoulder.“What are we doing?” she cried. “What’s it all for? What good is any of it?We’re losing everything.”Zedd had no answer for her tears at the futility of it all.The minutes dragged on. Kahlan forced herself to be strong, to be the MotherConfessor. She couldn’t let the men see her giving up.Silent men stood nearby, not wanting to look in the direction of the tent whereWarren lay dying.When General Meiffert materialized out of the darkness, the relief on Cara’sface was evident. He rushed up close to Cara, but didn’t touch her.“I’m glad to see you safely returned,” he said to Kahlan. “How is Warren?”Kahlan couldn’t speak.Zedd shook his head. “I didn’t think he would live this long. I think he held onso he could see his wife.”The general nodded sorrowfully. “We caught the man who did it.”Kahlan came to full attention. “Bring him to me,” she growled.Without hesitation the general hurried off to retrieve the assassin. When Kahlangestured, Cara went with him.“What did he say to you?” Zedd asked in a quiet voice so that others wouldn’thear. “He wanted to tell you something.”Kahlan took a purging breath. “He said, `Richard is right.’ “Zedd looked away in forlorn misery. Warren was his friend. Kahlan never knewZedd to take a liking to anyone the way he had taken to Warren. They sharedthings she knew she could never understand. Despite his young appearance, Warrenwas over a hundred and fifty years old, close to the same age as Verna. To Zedd,who was always looked up to as the wise old wizard, it must have been aparticular comfort to share wizardly matters with one who understood suchthings, instead of constantly needing explanation and direction.“He said the same to me,” Zedd whispered tearfully.“Why didn’t Warren use his gift?” Kahlan asked.Zedd wiped a finger across his cheek. “He was walking past, just as the manseized and stabbed Holly. Perhaps the assassin couldn’t find his target, ormaybe he became lost and confused, or he could have just panicked and decided tostab someone and Holly was handy at that moment.”Kahlan wiped her hands back across her cheeks. “Maybe he had been told to lookfor a wizard in such robes, and when he saw Warren, he stabbed Holly to cause acommotion so he could get at Warren.”“That could be. Warren doesn’t really know. It all happened in an instant.Warren was right there, and just reacted. I asked, but he didn’t know why hedidn’t use his power. Perhaps in that terrible flash of the knife, he feared tokill Holly in the process, since the man had her and was stabbing her. Hisinstinct to save her just caused him to snatch for the knife. It was a fatalmistake.”“Maybe Warren simply hesitated before using his power.”Zedd shrugged painfully. “A split-second hesitation has been the end of a lot ofwizards.”“If I hadn’t hesitated,” Kahlan said as she stared off into bitter memories,“Nicci wouldn’t have had me. She wouldn’t have Richard, now.”“Don’t try to fix the past, dear one-it can’t be done.”“What about the future?”Zedd’s gaze sought hers. “Meaning?”“Remember at the end of last winter, when we left camp-when the Order beganmoving?” When Zedd nodded, she went on. “Warren pointed at this place on themap. He said we had to be here to stop the Order.”“Are you suggesting he knew he would die here?”“You tell me.”“I’m a wizard, not a prophet.”“But Warren is.” When he said nothing, Kahlan asked in a whisper, “What aboutHolly?”“I don’t know. I was just arriving to talk to Warren. It had just happened.Soldiers were jumping the man. Warren yelled orders for them not to kill him. Iguess he was thinking the assassin might have valuable information. I saw Holly,bleeding from her wounds, in shock. I immediately had Warren brought in here andstarted to work on him. Sisters rushed in and took Holly to another tent.”Zedd’s heartsick gaze sank to the cold ground. “I did everything I know to do.It wasn’t enough.”Kahlan enclosed his shoulders protectively in her arm. “It was out of your handsfrom the first, Zedd.”It was disorienting to see her source of strength in a state of such painfulweakness. It was irrational to expect him to be unemotional and strong in suchcircumstances, but it was still disconcerting. In that moment, Kahlan wasovercome with a sense of all the loss Zedd had suffered in his life; it was allthere in his wet hazel eyes.Men made way for the returning General Meiffert and Cara. Behind them, two burlysoldiers had a wiry young man-little more than a boy, really. He was muscular,but no match for the men who had him. His hair tumbled down across a foreheadabove dark contemptuous eyes. He wore a proud sneer.“So,” the lad said, trying to sound tough, “I guess that in my service to theOrder I knifed someone important. That makes me a hero of the Order.”“Make him kneel before the Mother Confessor,” General Meiffert said with quietcommand.The two soldiers kicked the back of the young man’s knees to take him down. Hesnickered as he knelt before her.“So, you’re the big important whore I’ve heard so much about. Too bad youweren’t around-I’d have loved to have cut you. I guess I showed some people I’mpretty good with a knife.”“So in my absence,” Kahlan said, “you cut a child, instead.”“Just for practice. I’d have cut a lot more people if these big dumb oxenwouldn’t have lucked into jumping me. But I still did my duty to the Order andthe Creator.”It was the bravado of someone who knew he was about to pay the ultimate pricefor his actions. He was trying to convince himself that he had fulfilled avaluable service. He wanted to die a hero, and then go straight to the Creatorfor his reward in the afterlife.Verna emerged from the tent. There was no hurry in her movements. Her face wasashen and drawn. Kahlan took hold of her arm, ready to help if Verna should needit.Verna stopped when she saw the young man on his knees.“This is him?” she asked.Kahlan put her other hand tenderly to Verna’s back, silently offering support.“This is him,” Kahlan confirmed.“That’s right.” The lad sneered up at Verna. “I’m the one who knifed the enemywizard. I’m a hero. The Order will bring relief and justice to the people, and Ihelped do it. Your kind is always trying to keep us down.”“Keep you down,” Verna repeated in a dead tone.“Those who are born with all the luck and advantages-they never want to share. Iwaited, but no one ever gave me a chance in life until the Order did. I’m a heroof downtrodden people everywhere. I’ve struck a blow against the oppressors ofmankind. I’ve helped bring justice to those who are never given a chance. Ikilled an evil man. I’m a hero!”The silence of everyone nearby was all the more grim with the backdrop ofactivity going on as men searched the camp for other assassins. Officers calledout names, getting quick replies. Troops searching for invaders trotted throughthe night, their chain mail and weapons jingling like thousands of tiny bells.The man on his knees grinned at Verna. “The Creator will give me my reward inthe next life. I’m not afraid to die. I’ve earned eternity in his everlastingLight.”Verna passed her gaze among the eyes of all those gathered.“I don’t care what you do to him,” she said, “but I want to hear his screams theentire night. I want this camp to hear his screams the entire night. I want theOrder’s scouts to hear his screams. That will be my tribute to Warren.”The young man licked his lips, realizing things weren’t going as he hadexpected.“That isn’t fair!” the young assassin shouted in protest.Panic began to tremble through his body. He had been prepared for a martyr’sdeath, a quick end. This was something unforeseen.“He died quick. I should have the same consideration! This isn’t fair!”“Fair? What isn’t fair,” Verna said with terrible calmness, “is that your motherever opened her legs for your father. We shall now belatedly correct hermistake. What isn’t fair is that a good and kind man died at the hands of asniveling little coward so lacking in sense that he is incapable of recognizingthe lies he now spews out at us.“You wish to trade your life for the one you have taken? You wish to die in acause you foolishly believe to be noble? You shall have your wish, young man.But before you die, you shall fully understand what it is you have surrendered,how precious is your life, and how utterly wasted. You shall come to regret yourmother’s act of creation as much as do we.”Verna swept a look of finality over the group watching. “This is my wish. Pleasesee to its execution.”Cara took a step forward. “Let me do it, then.” Her grim face held no hint ofrelish. “I would be best at carrying out your wish as you intend it, Verna.”The lad laughed hysterically. “A woman? You all think you’re going to have somebig blond bitch try to teach me a lesson? You’re all as crazy as I’ve heard.”Verna nodded. “I will be indebted to you, Cara.” She started to leave, butpaused. “Don’t let him die before morning, when I will come to witness it. Iwish to look into his eyes and see if this young man has come to understand thenature of reality, and its lack of fairness, before he forfeits his fife fornothing of worth and for his part in a great evil.”“I promise you,” Cara said softly to Verna, “that even though this night willseem forever to you in your grief, it will be infinitely longer for him.”Verna simply touched Cara’s shoulder in appreciation on her way past.After Verna had walked off into the darkness, Cara turned to Kahlan. “I wouldask to use a tent. No one should have to see what I do to him. His screams willbe knowledge enough.”“As you wish.”“Mother Confessor!” The young man struggled frantically, but the soldiers hadhim in a firm grip. “If you’re so good as you claim, then show me mercy!”Drool ran from the corner of the boy’s mouth and hung swinging in rhythm withhis panting.“But I have,” Kahlan said. “I am allowing you to suffer the sentence Verna hasnamed, and not the one I would impose.”Cara snapped her fingers and pointed at the young man as she marched off. Thesoldiers dragged the shrieking boy after her.“The others we captured?” the general asked Kahlan.Kahlan started for her tent. “Cut their throats.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 62Kahlan sat up when she realized that she didn’t hear the distant screams anylonger. It was still hours till dawn. Maybe his heart had stopped unexpectedly.No, Cara was Mord-Sith, and was well trained in what Mord-Sith did.As she had lain fully dressed in her bed, listening to the bloodcurdlingscreams, aching for Verna, missing Warren, sweat had occasionally beaded herbrow whenever she thought about how Richard had once been the one under aMord-Sith’s Agiel.To banish the uninvited, ghastly images invading her thoughts, she looked up atSpirit. The lamp hanging from the ridgepole cast a warm light on the carving,stressing the graceful lines of her flowing robes, her fisted hands, her headthrown back. No matter how many times Kahlan looked at the statue, she nevertired of it. Every time, it was a thrill.Richard had chosen this view of life over the terrible bitterness he could havefallen into. Clinging to such bitterness would only have robbed him of hisability to experience happiness.Kahlan heard a commotion outside. Just as she sprang to her feet, Cara poked herhead in through the flap Kahlan had left open. The Mord-Sith’s blue eyes were ina lethal rage. She stepped into the tent, pulling the lad behind by a fistful ofhis hair. He shook as he blinked frantically, blinded by the blood in his eyes.Gritting her teeth, Cara shoved him. He fell to the dirt at Kahlan’s feet.“What’s this about?” Kahlan asked.The look in Cara’s eyes revealed a woman at the edge of a feral fury, at theedge of control, at the far-distant reaches of what it was to even be human. Shewas treading the soil of another world: madness.Cara dropped to her knees and seized the young man by the hair. She yanked himback up and held him against her red-leather-clad body as she pressed her Agielto his throat. He choked and coughed. Blood frothed from his mouth.“Tell her,” Cara growled.He held his hands out to the sides in surrender. “I know him! I know him!”Kahlan frowned down at the terrified young man. “You know who?”“Richard Cypher! I know Richard Cypher!-And his wife, Nicci.”Kahlan felt as if the world crashed down around her. The weight of that worldsank her to her knees before Cara’s charge.“What is your name?”“Gadi! I’m Gadi!”Cara pressed her Agiel into his back, causing him to let loose a wild scream.She slammed his face to the ground.Kahlan held a hand out. “Cara, wait . . . we need to talk to him.”“I know. I’m just making sure he wants to talk to us.”Kahlan had never seen Cara quite like this, unleashed this way. This was morethan doing as Verna asked. This was personal to Cara. Warren had been someoneshe liked, but worse for Gadi, Richard was Cara’s life.The Mord-Sith pulled him upright again. Red bubbles grew around his broken nose.When the light caught Cara just right, Kahlan could see blood glistening on thered leather.“Now, I want you to tell the Mother Confessor everything.”He was nodding as he wept and before Cara had even completed the command.“I lived there-where they came to live. I lived where Richard and his wife-”“Nicci,” Kahlan corrected.“Yes, Nicci.” He didn’t understand what she meant. “They came to live in a roomin our house. My friends and I didn’t like him. Then, Kamil and Nabbi startedtalking to him. They started liking Richard. I was angry-”He fell to such blubbering that he couldn’t finish. Kahlan seized his jaw, slickwith blood, and shook his face.“Talk! Or I’ll have Cara start in again!”“I don’t know what to say, what you want,” he sobbed.“Everything you know about him and Nicci. Everything!” Kahlan yelled inches fromhis face.“Tell her the rest of it,” Cara said in his ear as she pulled him to his feet.Kahlan followed him up, fearing to miss a precious word.“Richard started to get people to fix up the place. He works for Ishaq, at thetransport company. When he came home at night, he would fix things. He showedKamil and Nabbi how to fix things.“I hated him.”“You hated him because he made things better?”“He made Kamil and Nabbi and others think they could do things for themselves,when they can’t-people can’t do for themselves. That’s a cruel deception. Peoplehave to be helped by those with the ability. It’s their duty. Richard shouldhave made things better, because he could-he shouldn’t have made Kamil and Nabbiand the others think they could change their lives for themselves. No one can dothat. The people need help, not such heartless and unfeeling expectations.”“I found out Richard was working at night. He was hauling extra loads for greedypeople. He was making money he shouldn’t be allowed to make.“Then, one night, I was sitting on the steps, and I heard Nicci get mad atRichard. She came out to me on the steps and asked me to have sex with her.Women always want me. She was a whore-no better than the rest-despite all herairs. She told me that Richard wasn’t man enough to take care of her, and shewanted me to have her because he wouldn’t.“I gave it to her good just the way she wanted it. I gave it to the whore good.I hurt her good, just like she deserved-”With all her strength, Kahlan rammed her knee into his groin. Gadi doubled over,unable to draw his breath. His eyes rolled up in his head and he went down hard.Cara smiled. “I thought you might like to hear that part.”Kahlan wiped the tears from her cheeks. “It wasn’t Richard. I knew it wasn’tRichard. It was this pig.”Kahlan kicked him in the ribs as he started coming around. He let out a cry. Shewagged her fingers impatiently. Cara seized him by the hair and yanked him tohis feet.“Finish your story,” Kahlan said with icy rage.He coughed and gagged and drooled. Cara had to steady him on his feet. She heldhis arms behind his back so he couldn’t comfort his groin. The pain was clearlyevident in his contorted face.“Talk, or I’ll do it again!”“Please! I was telling you when you stopped me.”“Get on with it!”He nodded frantically. “When I was done with the whor-when I left Nicci, Kamiland Nabbi were crazy.”Kahlan lifted his chin. “What do you mean, they were crazy?”“They were crazy angry because I was with Richard’s wife. They like Richard, sothey were crazy angry with me. They were going to do things to me. Hurt me. So,I decided to go into the army to fight for the Order against the heathens, and.. .”Kahlan waited. She glanced up at Cara. The Mord-Sith did something behind Gadi’sback that made him gasp in a cry.“And then I turned in Richard’s name!”“You did what?”“I turned in his name before I left. I told the city guards at ProtectorMuksin’s office that Richard was doing criminal things, that he was stealingwork from working people-that he was making more than his fair share.”Kahlan frowned. “What does that mean? What happens when you turn in a name?”Gadi was trembling in terror. He clearly didn’t want to answer. Cara pressed herAgiel against his side. Blood oozed down his sweat-soaked shirt. He tried, butcouldn’t draw a breath. His ashen face began to turn purple.“Tell her,” Cara said in cold command.Gadi gasped in a breath when she released the pressure. “They will arrest him.They will . . . make him . . . confess.”“Confess?” Kahlan asked, fearing the answer.Gadi nodded reluctantly. “They will torture a confession out of him, mostlikely. They might even hang his body from a pole and let the birds pick hisbones if he confesses to something bad.”Kahlan swayed on her feet. She thought she might throw up. The world haddisintegrated into madness.She kicked over the map basket and pawed through the maps until she found theone she wanted. She pulled a pen and an ink bottle out of their box, set thestatue of Spirit on the ground, and spread the small map across the table.“Come here,” Kahlan ordered, snapping her fingers and pointing to the groundbefore the table. She put the pen in his trembling fingers after he had shuffledclose.Kahlan pointed at the map. “We are here. Show me where you traveled with theOrder.”He pointed. “This river. I came up from the Old World with reinforcement troops,after some training. We joined the emperor’s force and we advanced up this riverbasin over the summer.”Kahlan pointed to the Old World. “Now, I want you to mark the place where youlived.”“Altur’Rang. That’s it, there.”She watched him dip the pen and circle the dot and the name Altur’Rang, far tothe south-the heart of the Old World.“Now,” she said, “mark the roads you came up in the Old World-including anycities or towns you went through.”Cara and Kahlan both watched Gadi mark roads and circle a number of cities andtowns. Warren and the Sisters were from the Old World; they knew a great dealabout the lay of the land, enabling them to provide detailed maps.When he’d finished, Gadi looked up.Kahlan turned over the map. “Draw the city of Altur’Rang. I want to see themajor roads-anything you know of it.”Gadi immediately set to drawing the map for her. When he was finished, he lookedup again.“Now, show me where this room is where Richard lives.”Gadi marked the map to indicate the place. “But I don’t know if he will bethere. Lots of people turn in the names of people suspected of wrongdoingagainst their fellow man. If they take the name and they arrest him . . . theBrothers may order penance, or they could even question him and then order himput to death.”“Brothers?” Kahlan asked.Gadi nodded. “Brother Narev and his disciples. They are the head of theFellowship of Order. Brother Narev is our spiritual guide. He and the brothersare the heart of the Order.”“What do they look like?” Kahlan asked, her mind already racing ahead.“The brothers wear dark brown robes, with hoods. They are simple men who havegiven up the luxuries of life to serve the wishes of the Creator and the needsof mankind. Brother Narev is closer to the Creator than any man alive. He ismankind’s savior.”Gadi was clearly awed by the man. Kahlan listened while Gadi told her everythinghe knew about the Fellowship of Order, about the brothers, and about BrotherNarev.Gadi shook in the silence after he had finished. Kahlan wasn’t watching him, butstaring off.“What did Richard look like,” she asked in a distant voice. “Was he well? Did helook all right?”“Yes. He’s big and strong. Foolish people like him.”Kahlan spun around, landing the heel of her hand against Gadi’s face hard enoughto knock him from his feet.“Get him out of here,” she told Cara.“But you must show me mercy, now! I told you what you want to know!” He brokedown in tears. “You must show me mercy!”“You have a job to finish,” Kahlan said to Cara.Kahlan pulled the tent flap back and peeked in. Sister Dulcinia was snoringsoftly. Holly looked up.Tears filled the girl’s eyes as she stretched out her arms pleadingly. Kahlanknelt beside the girl and bent over to hug her. Holly started crying.Sister Dulcinia woke with a snort. “Mother Confessor.”Kahlan put a hand on the Sister’s arm. “It’s late. Why don’t you go get somesleep, Sister.”Sister Dulcinia smiled her agreement and then grunted with the effort ofstruggling to her feet in the low tent. In the distance, on the far side of thecamp, Kahlan could hear Gadi’s bloodcurdling screams.Kahlan smoothed the downy hair from Holly’s brow and kissed her there. “How areyou, sweetheart? Are you all right?”“Oh, Mother Confessor, it was awful. Wizard Warren got hurt. I saw it.”Kahlan hugged her as she started weeping again. “I know. I know.”“Is it all right? Is he healed like they healed me?”Kahlan cupped the little cheek and wiped a tear away with her thumb. “I’m sorry,Holly, but Warren died.”Her brow bunched up with her misery. “He shouldn’t have tried to save me. It’smy fault he’s dead.”“No,” Kahlan soothed. “That’s not the way it is. Warren gave his life to save usall. He did what he did out of his love of life. He didn’t want to let evil befree among those he loved.”“Do you really think so?”“Of course I do. Remember him for how he loved life, and how he wanted to seethose he loved free to live their own lives.”“He danced with me at his wedding. I thought he was the most handsome groomever.”“He was indeed a handsome groom,” Kahlan said with a smile at the memory. “Hewas one of the best men I’ve ever known, and he gave his life to help keep usfree. We honor his sacrifice by living the best lives we can live.”Kahlan started to rise, but Holly hugged her all the tighter, so Kahlan lay downbeside her. She stroked Holly’s brow, and kissed her cheek.“Will you stay with me, Mother Confessor? Please?”“For a while, sweetheart.”Holly fell asleep cuddled up to Kahlan. Kahlan wept frustrated bitter tears overthe sleeping girl, a girl who should have the right to live her life. Others,though, lusted to steal that right at the point of a blade.After she had finally decided what she must do, Kahlan slipped silently out ofthe tent to go pack her things.It was just turning light when Kahlan emerged from her tent carrying herbedroll, saddlebags, D’Haran sword, the Sword of Truth, leather armor, and packwith the rest of her things. Spirit was safely rolled up in her bedroll.A light snow was just beginning to fall, announcing to the muted camp thatwinter had arrived in the northern Midlands.Everything seemed as if it was ending. It wasn’t just Warren’s death thatconvinced her, but rather the futility it symbolized. She could no longer deludeherself. The truth was the truth. Richard was right.The Order would have it all. Sooner or later, they would have her and kill her,along with those who fought with her. It was only a matter of time until theyenslaved all of the New World. They already had much of the Midlands. Some landshad fallen willingly. There was no way to resist a force of their overwhelmingsize, the terror of their threats, or the seduction of their promises.Warren had attested it as part of his dying words: Richard was right.She had thought she could make a difference. She had thought she could driveback the advancing hordes-by the sheer weight of her will, if need be. It wasarrogance on her part. The forces of freedom were lost.Many of the people in those fallen lands had put their faith in the Order at thecost of their liberty.What was left to her? Running. Retreat. Terror. Death.She had nothing to lose anymore, really. Nearly everything was already lost, orsoon would be. While she at least still had her life, she was going to use it.She was going to go to the heart of the Order.“What are you doing?”Kahlan spun around to see Cara frowning at her.“Cara, I . . . I’m leaving.”Cara gave a single nod. “Good. I, too, think it is time. I won’t be long gettingmy things together. You get the horses, and I’ll meet-”“No. I’m going alone. You will stay here.”Cara stroked her long blond braid laying over the front of her shoulder. “Whyare you going?”“There’s nothing left here for me to do-nothing I can do. I’m going to go drivemy sword into the heart of the Order: Brother Narev and his disciples. It’s theonly thing I can do to strike back at them.”Cara smiled. “And you think I want to stay here?”“You will stay here, where you should be . . . with Benjamin.”“I’m sorry, Mother Confessor,” Cara said tenderly, “but I can’t follow suchorders. I am Mord-Sith. My life is sworn to protecting Lord Rahl. I promisedLord Rahl I would protect you, not stay and kiss Benjamin.”“Cara, I want you to stay here-”“It’s my life. If this is the end, all there is to be, then I will do with therest of my life as I wish. It’s my life to live, not yours to live for me. I’mgoing, and that is final.”Kahlan saw in Cara’s eyes that it was. Kahlan didn’t think she had ever heardCara express such a sentiment about her own wishes. It was indeed her life.Besides, Cara knew where Kahlan was going. If Kahlan left without Cara, Carawould simply follow. Getting Mord-Sith to obey orders was often more difficultthan herding ants.“You’re right, Cara; it is your life. But when we get down into the Old World,you’re going to have to wear something to disguise who you are. Red leather inthe Old World will be the end of us.”“I will do what I must to protect you and Lord Rahl.”Kahlan smiled at last. “I believe you would, Cara.”Cara wasn’t smiling. Kahlan’s smile faded.“I’m sorry I tried to leave without you, Cara. I shouldn’t have done it thatway. You’re a sister of the Agiel. I should have talked it over with you. That’sthe proper way to treat someone you respect.”Cara smiled at last. “Now you are making sense.”“We might not ever come back from this.”Cara shrugged. “And you think we will live the high life if we stay? I thinkonly certain death awaits us if we stay.”Kahlan nodded. “That’s what I think, too. That’s why I must go.”“I’m not quarreling.”Kahlan gazed out at the falling snow. The last time winter had come, she andCara had just managed to escape in time.Kahlan steeled herself and asked, “Cara, do you really believe Richard is stillalive?”“Of course Lord Rahl is alive.” Cara held up her Agiel, rolling it in herfingers. “Remember?”And then she did: the Agiel would only work if the Lord Rahl to whom she wassworn was alive.Kahlan handed Cara some of her load. “Gadi?”“He died as Verna wished it. She showed him no pity.”“Good. Pity for the guilty is treason to the innocent.”It was not long after dawn when Kahlan made it to Zedd’s tent. Cara had gone toget horses and supplies. When Kahlan called, Zedd asked her to enter. He rosefrom the bench beside Adie, the old sorceress.“Kahlan. What is it?”“I’ve come to bid you good-bye.”Zedd’s eyes showed no surprise. “Why don’t you stay and get some rest? Leavetomorrow.”“There are no tomorrows left. Winter is upon us again. If I am going to do as Imust, I don’t have a day to waste.”Zedd gently gripped her shoulders. “Kahlan, Warren wanted to see you. He felt hehad to tell you that Richard was right. It meant a great deal to him that youknow that. Richard told us that you must not attack the heart of the Orderbefore the people prove themselves to him, or all will be lost. Such a thing iseven less likely to happen today than the day he said it.”“And maybe Warren meant that Richard was right-that we are going to lose the NewWorld to the Order, so what is there to stay for? Maybe it was Warren’s way oftrying to tell me to go to Richard before I’m dead, or he’s dead, and then it’stoo late to even try.”“And Nicci?”“I’ll find out when I get there.”“But, you can’t hope to-”-“Zedd, what else is there for me? To watch the Midlands fall? To aspire at mostto live out my life running, to live as a recluse, hiding every day from theclutches of the Order?“Even if Warren hadn’t said it, I’ve come to realize-no matter how much I wishit was otherwise-that Richard is right. The Order will only be pinned down forthe winter while we help the people escape Aydindril. In the spring, the enemywill flood into my city. Then they will turn to D’Hara. There will be nowhere torun. Though they escape for the moment, the Order will subjugate those people.“There is no future for me. Richard was right. The least I can do is spend thelast of my life living for myself, and for Richard. There is nothing else leftfor me, Zedd.”Tears brimmed in his eyes. “I will miss you so. You’ve brought back goodmemories of my own daughter and given me so many good times.”Kahlan threw her arms around him. “Oh, Zedd, I love you.”She couldn’t hold back her own tears, then. She was all he had left, and he waslosing her, too.No-that wasn’t true. Kahlan pulled back.“Zedd, the time has come for you to leave, too. You must go to the Keep andprotect it.”He nodded with great reluctance, great sadness. “I know.”Kahlan knelt before the sorceress and took up her hand. “Adie, will you go withhim and keep him company?”A beautiful smile came to the woman’s weathered face. “Well, I . . .” She lookedup. “Zedd?”Zedd scowled. “Bags, now you’ve ruined the surprise of the invite.”Kahlan smacked his leg. “Stop cursing in front of ladies-and stop being so sour.I’d like to know you’re not going to be lonely up there.”A smile stole across his face. “Of course Adie is going to the Keep with me.”Adie scowled in turn. “How do you know that, old man? You never asked myapproval. Why, I have a mind-”“Please stop it,” Kahlan said. “Both of you. This is too important to be fussingover.”“I can fuss if I want to,” Zedd protested.“That be right.” Adie shook a thin finger. “We are old enough to fuss if wewish.”Kahlan smiled through her tears. “Of course you can. It’s just that, afterWarren . . . it reminds me of how much I hate to see people waste their lives onthings that don’t matter.”Zedd truly did scowl, now. “You’ve a thing or two to learn, dear one, if youdon’t know how important fussing is.”“That be right,” Adie said. “Fussing keeps you sharp. When you get old, you needto stay sharp.”“Adie is entirely right,” Zedd said. “Why, I think-”Kahlan silenced him with a hug that Adie joined.“Are you sure about this, dear one?” Zedd asked after they parted.“I am. I’m going to take my sword into the belly of the Order.”Zedd nodded as he hooked his bony fingers around the back of her neck. He pulledher head close and kissed her brow.“If you’re to go, then ride hard and strike harder.”“My thought, exactly,” Cara said as she stepped into the tent.Kahlan thought Cara’s blue eyes looked a little more liquid than usual. “Are youall right, Cara?”Cara frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”“Nothing,” Kahlan said.“General Meiffert got us the six fastest horses he could find.” Cara smiled herpleasure at the prospect. “We’ll have fresh mounts with us and be able to covera lot of ground fast. I have all our supplies loaded up.“If we leave now, we should be able to escape winter’s grip. We have the map, sowe can stay away from the routes the Order’s troops use, and the heaviestpopulation centers. There are good roads, and open country down there. Ridinghard, I think that we can make it in a few weeks. A month at most.”Zedd’s face contorted with concern. “But the Order controls much of the southernMidlands. It’s dangerous country, now.”“I have a better way.” Cara flashed a sly smile. “We’ll go where I know thecountry-D’ Hara. We will go east from here and cross over the mountains, then gosouth down through D’Hara-through mostly wide-open country were we can make goodtime-down through the Azrith Plains, to eventually join the Kern River far tothe south. After the river valley clears the mountains, we will cut southeastinto the heart of the Old World.”Zedd nodded his approval of the plan. Kahlan curled her fingers lovingly aroundthe old wizard’s thin arm.“When will you go to the Keep?”“Adie and I will leave in the morning. I think it best not to dally here anylonger. Today we’ll settle matters of the army with the officers and theSisters. I think that as soon as the people are out of Aydindril, and when thesnow quickly deepens to insure the Order won’t be going anywhere until spring,then our men should begin slipping out of this place to make their way over themountains to the safety of D’Hara. It will be slow going in winter, but withouthaving to fight as they travel, it won’t be as difficult as it otherwise wouldbe.”“That would be best,” Kahlan agreed. “It will get our men out of harm’s way fornow.”“They won’t have me to be the magic against magic for them, but they will haveVerna and her Sisters. They know enough by now to carry on protecting the armyfrom magic.”At least for a while. The words hung in the air, unspoken.“I want to go see Verna before I leave,” Kahlan said. “I think it will be goodfor her to have other people to worry about. Then I want to see GeneralMeiffert; and then we’d best start riding. We have a long way to go, and I wantto be south before the snow hobbles us.”Kahlan embraced Zedd fiercely one last time.“When you see him,” Zedd whispered in her ear, “tell the boy I love him dearly,and I miss him something awful.”Kahlan nodded against his shoulder, and told him a bold lie.“You’ll see us both again, Zedd. I promise you.”Kahlan stepped out into the early light of winter’s first breath. Everything wasdusted with snow, making it look as if the world were carvedfrom white marble."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 63In one long fluid motion, with his fingertips adeptly guiding the far end of thefile, Richard glided the steel tool down the fold of cloth held forever crisp inwhite marble. Concentrating on applying steady pressure to cut a precise, finelayer, he was lost in the work.The file held hundreds of ridges, row upon row of tiny blades of hardened steel,which did the work of cutting away and shaping the noble stone. These wereblades he wielded with the same commitment with which he wielded any blade. Heblindly reached back and set the file down on the wooden bench, careful to putit on the wood and not to let it clang against other steel, lest he dull itprematurely. He exchanged the file for another, with even finer teeth, and tookout the roughness left by the correction accomplished with the one before.With fingers as dusty-white as those of a baker laboring with flour, Richardexamined the surface of the man’s arm, testing it for flaws. Until polished, theminor flaws and facets were often easier to see with the fingers than the eye.Where he found them, he used a smaller file in one hand, while his other handfollowed behind, riding the swell of muscle, feeling the subtle difference inwhat the tool had done to the stone. He was removing only paper-thin layers ofmaterial, now.It had taken him several months to arrive at this final layer. It wasexhilarating to be so close to the flesh. The days had passed, one upon another,in an endless procession of work, carving death in the day down at the site, andlife in the night. Carving for the Order was balanced by carving forhimself-slavery and freedom in opposition.Whenever one of the brothers inquired about the statue, Richard was careful tohide his satisfaction with what he was creating. He did it by recalling themodel he had been commanded to carve. He always bowed his head respectfully andreported his progress on his penance, assuring them that his work was onschedule and would be done on time to install in the palace plaza for thededication.Stressing the word “penance” helped to direct their thoughts to that issue andaway from the statue itself. The brothers were invariably much more satisfiedwith his weariness from his toil at his work of contrition that they wereinterested in yet another dreary stone carving. There were carvings everywhere;this was but one more manifestation of the irredeemable inadequacy of mankind.Just as no one man in their cosmos was important, no one work mattered. It wasthe sheer number of carvings which was to be the Order’s overpowering argumentfor man’s impotence. The carvings were merely background props for the stageupon which the brothers moralized on sacrifice and salvation.Richard always humbly reported his nights with little food and little sleep ashe worked on his penance after his carving work during the day. Selflesssacrifice being the proper cure for wickedness, the brothers went away pleased.Richard switched to a smaller file, one bent in a decreasing radius curve, andworked the muscle where it narrowed into sinew, showing the tension in the armwhich revealed the underlying structure. During the day he observed other men asthey worked, in order to study the complex shapes of muscle as it moved withlife. At night, he referred to his own arms held up to the lamplight so that hemight accurately depict veins and tendons standing proud on the surface. Hereferred to a small mirror at times. The surface of the skin he carved was arich landscape stretched over bone and muscle, creased in corners, drawn smoothas it swept over curves.For the woman’s body, his memory of Kahlan was vivid enough to require littleother reference.He wanted this work to show the capacity for movement, for intent, foraccomplishment. The posture of the figures displayed awareness. The expressionof the faces, especially the eyes, would show that most sublime humancharacteristic: thought.If the statues he had seen in the Old World were a celebration of misery anddeath, this was a celebration of life.He wanted this to show the raw power of volition.The man and woman he carved were his refuge against his despair over hiscaptivity. They embodied freedom of spirit. They embodied reason rising up totriumph.To his great annoyance, Richard noticed that light was coming in the windowabove the statue, taking over from the lamps that had burned all night. Allnight; he had done it again.It was not the quality of the light, which he actually very much favored, whichvexed him, but that it signified the end of his time with his statue; he now hadto go carve ugliness down at the site. Fortunately, that work required nothought or careful effort.As he draw-filed the curve of the man’s shoulder muscle, there was a knock atthe door. “Richard?”It was Victor. Richard sighed; he had to stop.Richard pulled the red cloth tied around his neck down away from his nose andmouth, where it kept him from breathing all the marble dust. It was a littletrick Victor had told him about, used by the marble carvers from his homeland ofCavatura.“Be right there.”-Richard stepped down off the ledge made by the base, where he had carved out thelegs at midcalf. He stretched his back, realizing how much it hurt from hunchingover, and from lack of sleep. He retrieved the canvas tarp and shook the dustfrom it.Just before he flung the cover over the statue, he got the full view of thefigures. The floor, shelves, and tools were covered in a fine layer of marbledust. But against the black walls, the marble stood out in the glory of lightfrom above.Richard threw the tarp over the incomplete figures and then opened the door.“You look a ghost,” Victor announced with a lopsided grin.Richard brushed himself off. “I forgot the time.”“Did you see in the shop last night?”“The shop? No, what?”Victor’s grin returned, wider this time. “Priska had the bronze dial deliveredyesterday. Ishaq brought it. Come see.”Around the other side of the blacksmith’s shop, in the stock room, the bronzesat in a number of pieces. It was too big for Priska to cast as one piece, so hehad made several that Victor would join and mount. The pedestal for the partialring that would be the dial plane was massive. Knowing it was for a statueRichard was carving, Priska had done a job to be proud of.“It’s beautiful,” Richard said.“Isn’t it, though? I’ve seen him do fine work before, but this time Priska hasoutdone himself.”Victor squatted and ran his fingers over the strange symbols filled in withblack. “Priska said that at one time, long ago, his home city of Altur’Rang hadfreedom, but, like so many others, lost it. As a tribute to that time, he castit with symbols in his native tongue. Brother Neal saw it, and was pleasedbecause he thought it a tribute to the emperor, who is also from Altur’Rang.”Richard sighed. “Priska has a tongue as smooth as his castings.”“Would you have some lardo with me?” Victor asked as he stood.The sun was already well up. Richard stretched his neck and peered down at thesite.“I’d best not. I need to get to work.” Richard squatted down and lifted one endof the pedestal. “First, though, let me show you where this goes.”Victor grabbed the other end and together they lugged the bronze casting aroundthe shop. When Richard opened the double doors, Victor saw the statue for thefirst time, even if it was covered in a tarp that revealed only the round bulgesthat were the two heads. Even so, Victor’s eyes feasted. It was apparent inthose eyes how his vivid imagination was filling in some of it with his fondesthopes.“Your statue is going well?” Victor nudged Richard with an elbow. “Beauty?”Richard was overcome with a blissful smile. “Ali, Victor, you will see foryourself soon enough. The dedication is only a couple weeks off. I will beready. It will be something to bring a song to our hearts . . . before they killme, anyway.”Victor dismissed such talk with a flourish of his hand. “I am hoping that whenthey see such beauty again, and at their palace, they will approve.”Richard held out no such illusion. He remembered then, and reached into a pocketto pull out a piece of paper. He handed it to the blacksmith.“I didn’t want Priska to cast words on the back of the dial because I didn’twant the wrong people to see them. I would ask you to engrave these words on theback surface-about the same height as the symbols on the front.”Victor took the paper and unfolded it. His grin melted away. He looked up atRichard with an open look of surprise.“This is treason.”Richard shrugged. “They can only kill me once.”“They can torture you a long time before they kill you. They have veryunpleasant ways to kill people, too, Richard. Have you ever seen a man buried inthe sky while he was still alive, bleeding from a thousand cuts, his arms bound,so that the vultures could feast on his living flesh?”“The Order binds my arms, now, Victor. As I work down there, as I see the deatharound me, I am bleeding from a thousand cuts. The vultures of the Order arealready feasting on my flesh.” With grim resolve, Richard held Victor’s gaze.“Will you do it?”Victor glanced down at the paper again. He took a deep breath and then let itslowly out as he studied the paper in his hand. “Treason though these words be,I like them. I will do it.”Richard clapped him on the side of the shoulder and gave him a confident smile.“Good man. Now, look here, where the pedestal is to be attached.”Richard lifted the tarp enough to uncover the base. “I’ve carved you a flat facetilted at the proper angle. I didn’t know where the holes in the casting wouldbe, so I left it for you to drill the holes and fill them with lead for thepins. Once you attach the pedestal, then I can calculate the angle of the holeI’ll need to drill for the gnomon.”Victor nodded. “The gnomon pole will be ready soon. I will make you a drill bitthe proper size for it.”“Good. And a round rasp to do final fitting in the hole?”“You will have it,” Victor said as they both stood. He waved his hand toward thecovered statue. “You trust me not to peek while you are off carving your uglywork?”Richard chuckled. “Victor, I know you want more than anything to see thenobility of this statue when it is finally finished. You would not spoil thatexperience for yourself for anything.”Victor let out his rolling belly laugh. “I guess you are right. Come after yourwork, and we will have lardo and talk of beauty in stone and the way the worldonce was.”Richard hardly heard Victor. He was staring at what he knew so well. Even thoughit was covered from his eyes, it was not hidden from his soul.He was ready to begin the process of polishing. To make flesh in stone.Her head bent, her scarf protecting her from the chill winter wind, Niccihurried down the narrow alleyway. A man coming the other way bumped against hershoulder, not because he was rushing, but because he simply didn’t seem to carewhere he was going. Nicci threw a fiery scowl at his empty eyes. Her fierce lookfell away down a bottomless well of indifference.She clutched her sack of sunflower seeds closer to her stomach as she moved onthrough the muddy alleyway. She stayed close to the rough wooden walls of thebuildings so she wouldn’t be jostled by the people going the other way. Peoplebundled against the current cold snap moved through the alleyway toward thestreet beyond, looking for rooms, for food, for clothes, for jobs. She could seemen beyond the alley sitting on the ground, leaning against buildings on the farside of the street, watching without seeing as wagons rumbled down the roads,taking supplies out to the site of the emperor’s palace.Nicci wanted to get to the bread shop. She had been told they might have buttertoday. She wanted to get butter for Richard’s bread. He would be home fordinnerhe had promised. She wanted to make him a good meal. He needed to eat. Hehad lost some weight, though it only added distracting definition to hismuscular build. He was like a statue in the flesh-like the statues she used tosee, long ago.She remembered how when she was little her mother’s servants made cakes out ofsunflower meal. She had been able to buy enough to make him some sunflowercakes, and maybe she would have butter to put on them.Nicci was growing increasingly anxious. The dedication was to take place in afew days. Richard said his statue would be ready. He seemed too calm about it,as if he had come to some inner peace.He seemed almost like a man who had accepted his imminent execution.Whenever Richard spoke to her, despite the conversation, his mind seemedelsewhere, and his eyes held that quality which she so valued. In the wastelandthat was life, the misery that was existence, this was the only hope left toher. All around her, people looked forward only to death. Only in her father’seyes when she was younger, and more so now in Richard’s, did she see anyevidence that there was something to make it all worthwhile, some reason forexistence.Nicci was slowed to a halt by the clink-clink-clink of pebbles rattling in acup. The sound was the unmistakable rattle of her chains. She had been a servantto need her whole life, and as much as she tried, there it was, the cup of somepoor beggar, still rattling for her help.She could not deny it.Tears filled her eyes. She had so wanted to serve Richard butter with his bread.But she had only one silver penny, and this beggar had nothing. She at least hadsome bread and some sunflower seeds. How could she want butter for Richard’sbread and cakes, when this man had nothing?She was evil, she knew, for wanting to keep her silver penny, the penny Richardhad earned with his own sweat and effort. She was evil for wanting to buy butterfor Richard with it. Who was Richard, to have butter? He was strong. He wasable. Why should he have more, while others had none?Nicci could almost see her mother slowly shaking her head in bitterdisappointment that the penny was still in Nicci’s fist, and not helping the manin need.How was it that she could never seem to live up to her mother’s example ofmorality? How was it she could never overcome her evil nature?Nicci turned slowly and dropped her silver penny in the beggar’s cup.People gave the beggar a wide berth. Without seeing him, they avoided comingnear him. They were deaf to the rattle of his cup. How could people not yet havelearned the Order’s teachings? How could they not help those in need? It wasalways left to her.She looked at him, then, and recoiled at the sight of the hideous man swathed infilthy rags. She pulled back more when she saw lice hopping through his thatchof greasy hair. He peered out at her through a slit in the rags draped aroundhis face.But it was what she saw through that slit that caught her breath in her throat.The scars were gruesome, to be sure, as if he had been melted by the Keeper’sown fires, yet it was the eyes that gripped her as the man slowly rose to hisfeet.The man’s grimy fingers, like a claw, curled around her arm. “Nicci,” he hissedin startled triumph, drawing her close.Caught in the grip of his powerful fingers, and his burning glare, she wasunable to move. She was so close she could see his lice hopping at her.“Kadar Kardeef.”“So, you recognize me? Even like this?”She said nothing else, but her eyes must have said that she thought he was dead;for he answered her unspoken question.“Remember that little girl? The one you seemed to care so much about? She urgedthe town’s people to save me. She refused to allow me to die there on the fire,where you had put me. She hated you so much she was determined to save me. Sheselflessly devoted herself to caring for me, to helping her fellow man, as youhad ordered the town’s people to do.“Oh, I wanted to die. I never knew a person could have that much pain and stilllive. As much as I wanted to die, I lived, because I want you to die even more.You did this to me. I want the Keeper to sink his fangs into your soul.”Nicci looked deliberately at his grotesque scars. “And so, for this, you havecome seeking your revenge.”“No, not for that. For making me beg, where my men could hear it. For allowingother people to hear me beg for my life. It was for that reason they savedme-and their hatred of you. It is for that that I seek revenge-for not allowingme to die, for condemning me to this life of a freak where passing women tosspennies in my cup.”Nicci gave him a smooth smile. “Why, Kadar, if you want to die, I can certainlyoblige you.”He released her arm as if it had burned his fingers. His imagination gave herpowers she didn’t have.He spat at her.“Kill me, then, you filthy witch. Strike me dead.”Nicci flicked her wrist and brought her dacra to hand. The dacra was a knifelikeweapon carried by Sisters. Once the sharpened rod was stuck into a victim, nomatter where, releasing her power into the dacra killed them instantly. KadarKardeef didn’t know she had no power. But even without her power behind it, thedacra was still a dangerous weapon that could be driven into a heart, or througha skull.He wisely backed away. He wanted to die, yet he feared it.“Why didn’t you go to Jagang. He would not have let you become a beggar. Jagangwas your friend. He would have taken care of you. You would not have to beg..Kadar Kardeef laughed. “You’d have liked that, wouldn’t you? To see me livingoff the scraps of Jagang’s table? You would love to sit at his side, the SlaveQueen, and have him see me fallen to this, to watch as you two tossed me yourcrumbs.”“Fallen to what? To see you wounded? You’ve both been wounded before.”He snatched her wrist again. “I died a hero to Jagang. I would not want him toknow I begged like any of the weak fools we have crushed beneath our boots.”Nicci pressed her dacra against his belly, backing him off.“Kill me, then, Nicci.” He opened his arms. “Finish it, like you should have.You never left a job incomplete before. Strike me dead, like I should have beenlong ago.”Nicci smiled again. “Death is no punishment. Every day you live is a thousanddeaths. But you know that, don’t you, Kadar?”“Was I that repulsive to you, Nicci? Was I that cruel to you?”How could she tell him that he was, and how much she hated him having her aschattel for his amusement? It was for the good of all that the Order used menlike Kadar Kardeef. How could she put herself, her own interests, above the goodof mankind?Nicci turned and rushed off down the alleyway.“Thank you for the penny!” he called mockingly after her. “You should havegranted my request! You should have, Nicci!”Nicci wanted only to go-home and scrub the lice out of her hair. She could feelthem burrowing into her scalp."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 64Richard pulled away the fistful of straw. He brushed the fragments of grassesfrom his leather apron. His arms ached from the labor of rubbing the straw,lightly loaded with fine abrasive clays, against the stone.Yet, when he saw the luster of the stone, the character of the high polish, theway the marble glowed, taking light deep into the stone and returning it, hefelt only exhilaration.The figures emerged from a sparkling stone base of rough marble. The groovedlines of the toothed chisels used in opposing directions to shear off thinlayers of stone were still evident on the lower calves, where the legs emergedhe wanted the statue to bear testimony to the hand of man and the figures’origin in stone.They rose up to nearly twice his height. The statue was in part a representationof his love for Kahlan-he could not keep Kahlan out of the work, because Kahlanwas his idea of a woman-yet the woman in the statue was not Kahlan. It was a manof virtue with a woman of virtue joined in purpose. They complemented eachother, the two universal parts of what it was to be human.The curved section of the sundial had been placed by Victor and his men severaldays before, when Richard had been working down at his job at the site of theemperor’s palace. They had left the tarp over the statue as they worked. Afterthe ring had been set, Richard had placed the pole that served as the gnomon,and finished the hand holding it. The base of the pole was fixed with a goldball.Victor had yet to see the statue. He was beside himself with eager anticipation.As Richard stared at the figures, only the light from the window above enteredthe darkened room. He had been given the day from work down at the site in orderto prepare the statue to be moved to the plaza that evening. In the rooms beyondthe shop door, the hammers of the blacksmiths rang ceaselessly as Victor’s menworked on orders for the palace.Richard stood in the near darkness, listening to the sounds of the blacksmithshop, as he stared up at the power of what he had created. It was exactly as hehad intended.The figures of the man and woman seemed as if they might draw a breath at anymoment and step out of the stone base. They had bone and muscle, sinew andflesh.Flesh in stone.There was only one thing missing-one thing left to do.Richard picked up his mallet and a sharp chisel.When he looked up at the finished statues, there were moments when he couldalmost believe, as Kahlan insisted, that he used magic to carve, yet he knewbetter. This was a conscious act of human intellect, and nothing more.Standing there, chisel and mallet in hand, gazing at the statue that was hisvision in stone, was a moment when Richard could savor the supreme achievementof having his creation exist exactly as he had originally conceived it.For this singular moment in time, it was complete, and it was his alone.It was, for this moment, pure in its existence, untainted by what othersthought. For this moment it was his accomplishment, and he knew its value in hisown heart and mind.Richard went to one knee before the figures. He laid the cold steel of thechisel to his forehead and closed his eyes as he concentrated on what he hadleft to do.“Blade, be true this day.”He pulled the red cloth tied at his throat up over his nose so not to have tobreathe the stone dust, then set the chisel to the marks in the fiat place hehad already prepared just above the heart of the flaw. Richard brought themallet down, and began to carve the title of the statue in the base for all tosee.Nicci, standing behind the corner of a building around a curve in the road,watched farther down the hill as Richard left the shop where he had carved hisstatue. He was probably going to see about getting the team to move the stone.He closed the door, but he didn’t put the chain on it. No doubt, he didn’tintend to be gone for long.Men were working all over the hillside at a variety of shops. Tradesmen fromleather workers to goldsmiths contributed to a constant din of saws, grinding,and hammering. The ceaseless uproar of the labor was nerve-racking. While manyof the men coming and going gave Nicci a good look-see, her glare warned themoff.Once she saw Richard disappear beyond the blacksmith’s shop, she started downthe road. She had told him she would wait until he was done before she came tosee it. She had kept her word.Still, she felt uneasy. She didn’t know why, but she felt almost as if she wouldbe invading a sacred site. Richard hadn’t invited her to see his statue. He hadasked her to wait until it was done. Since it was done, she would wait nolonger.Nicci didn’t want to see it up on the plaza of the palace along with everyoneelse. She wanted to be alone with it. She didn’t care about the Order and theirinterest in the statue. She didn’t want to be standing with everyone else, withpeople who would not recognize it as something of significance. This waspersonal to her, and she wanted to see it in private.She reached the door without anyone accosting her, or even paying her any mind.She looked around in the bright, hazy midafternoon light, but saw only menattending to their work. She opened the door and slipped inside.The room was dark, its walls black, but the statue inside was well lit by lightcoming down from a window in the high roof. Nicci didn’t look directly at thestatue, but kept her eyes to the floor as she hurried around the huge stone soshe could see it for the first time from the front.Once in place, her pulse pounding, she turned.Nicci’s gaze rose up the legs, the robes, the arms, the bodies of the twopeople, up to their faces. She felt as if a giant fist squeezed her heart to astop.This was what was in Richard’s eyes, brought into existence in glowing whitemarble. To see it fully realized was like being struck by lightning.In that instant, her entire life, everything that had ever happened to her,everything she had ever seen, heard, or done, seemed to come together in oneflash of emotional violence. Nicci cried out in pain at the beauty of it, andmore so at the beauty of what it represented.Her eyes fell on the name carved in the stone base.LIFENicci collapsed to the floor in tears, in abject shame, in horror, in revulsion,in sudden blinding comprehension .. . . In pure joy."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 65After Richard had returned with the fine white linen he had bought to cover thestatue until the ceremony the following day, he helped Ishaq and a number of themen he knew from down at the site begin the slow process of sledging the heavystone down to the plaza. Fortunately, it hadn’t rained in a while, and theground was firm.Ishaq, knowing such business well, had brought along greased wooden runners,which were placed before the hefty wooden rails supporting the wooden platformunder the statue so that the teams of horses could more easily pull the heavyload across the ground. After the statue was dragged onto the second set ofgreased runners, the men brought the ones left behind to the front, leapfroggingthe statue as it was moved along.The hillside was white with the scree of waste stone, so the statue weighedconsiderably less than it once had. Victor had originally hired specialstone-hauling wagons to move the block. They couldn’t use them now because thefinished piece couldn’t be turned on its side or handled in such a rough manner.Ishaq waved his red hat in his fist, yelling orders, warnings, and prayers asthey had moved along. Richard knew that his statue could be in no better hands.The men who helped seemed to pick up Ishaq’s nervous tension. They sensed thiswas something important, and, though the work was difficult, they seemed morepleased to be a part of it than they were about their everyday labor at thesite. It took until late afternoon to move the statue the distance from the shopto the foot of the steps leading up to the plaza.Men shoveled dirt at the bottom of the stairs and packed it tight in order toease the transition in grade. A team of ten horses was taken around the otherside of the columns. Long lengths of rope were passed through the vacantdoorways and windows, and then secured around the stone base in order to drawthe sledge up the steps. The extra runners were laid on the leading edge of thedirt ramp, later to be moved up onto the steps as the statue progressed upward.Near to two hundred men swooped in at Ishaq’s frantic screaming to help pull onthe ropes along with the horses. Inch by inch, the statue ascended the steps.Richard could hardly stand to watch. If anything went wrong, all his work wouldtumble back and shatter. The flaw would destroy it all. He smiled to himself,realizing how silly it was to worry that the evidence of his crime against theOrder might be ruined.When the stone had finally arrived safely up on the plaza, sand was packedunderneath the platform to support its weight. With the sand holding the woodenplatform secure, the heavy runners were removed. With the runners off, theplatform was slid off its hill of sand. From there, it was a relatively simpletask to coax the statue off the wooden base and onto the plaza itself. At last,marble sat on marble. Gangs of men with ropes around the stone base tugged thefreed statue into its final resting place at the center point of the plaza.Ishaq stood beside Richard when it was over, mopping his brow with his red hat.The entire statue and sundial was shrouded in its white linen cover, with linesecuring it, so Ishaq couldn’t see what it was. Still, he sensed something ofimportance stood before him.“When?” was all Ishaq asked.Richard knew what he meant. “I guess I’m not sure. Brother Narev is to dedicatethe palace to the Creator tomorrow, before all the officials who have traveledto see how the money they’ve looted from the people is being spent. I guess thattomorrow the officials, along with everyone who comes to the ceremony, are tosee the statue along with the rest of the palace. It’s just another display ofthe Order’s view of man’s place-I don’t think they intend any unveiling oranything like that.”From what Richard had learned, the ceremony was a matter of great concern to thebrothers. The drain of the expense of the palace on top of the expense of thewar required justification to the people who were paying that price not onlywith their sweat, but with their blood. The Fellowship of Order ruled, throughthe Imperial Order, with the necessary collaboration of brutes to whom they gavemoral sanction. While the brutes had easily crushed the bodies of those who hadrevolted, the brothers wanted to crush the ideas such revolt represented, beforethey could spread, because it was such ideas that were the greatest threat tothem.To that end, it was also important to inspire the officials: the minions of theOrder’s tyranny. Richard imagined that with scenes of man’s depravity carvedinto thousands of feet of stone wall, the flock of far-flung officials of theOrder were going to be given guided tours, by the brothers, of all mankind’sfailings, and thus coerced into their duty of turning over money they hadalready confiscated at the point of a blade-a blade they wielded under the moralsanction of the brothers through the Fellowship of Order. Such petty officialswere allowed a slice for their service to the Order, but the brothers no doubtwanted to forcefully dissuade them from any grander notions.Under the direction of the brothers, the collective of the Order, like anyautocratic ruler, ultimately ruled only by the acquiesce of the people, who werecontrolled either by moral intimidation, or by physical threat, or by both.Tyranny required constant tending, lest the illusion of righteous authorityevaporate in the light of its grim toll, and the brutes be overpowered by thepeople who greatly outnumbered them.That was why Richard had known he couldn’t lead: he could not bludgeon peopleinto understanding that bludgeoning was wrong because their lives were of greatvalue, whereas the Order could have them bludgeoned into obedience by firstmaking people believe that their lives were of no value. Free people were notruled. Freedom had first to be valued before its existence could be demanded.“From what I’m told, it is to be a big event,” Ishaq said. “People from all overare coming to the dedication of the emperor’s palace. The city is full of peoplefrom far and near.”Richard looked around at the site as the workers trudged back to their regularjobs.“I’m surprised none of the officials have come to have a look at the palace inadvance.”Ishaq waved his hat dismissively. “They are all at the gathering of theFellowship of Order. In the center of Altur’Rang. Big doings. Food, drink,speeches by the brothers. You know how the Order likes meetings. Very boring, Iimagine. From what I know of such events, the officials will be kept busyhearing of the needs of the Order and their duty to get people to sacrifice tothat need. The brothers will keep them all under tight rein.”That meant the brothers would all be busy-too busy to come out to the site forthe trivial task of checking a statue one of their slaves had carved. In thescheme of things, Richard’s statue was insignificant. It was only the startingpoint of the stately tour of the miles of walls displaying extensive scenesdepicting the grand cause of the Order, as dictated by the brothers, underNarev’s leadership.If the officials and the brothers were too busy to come today, the people of thecity were not. Most would probably attend the events of the next day, but theywanted to get a sense of the place for themselves, first, without the boringspeeches that would drag out the ceremony. Richard watched many of those peoplego from one scene on the walls to another, their faces stricken with thedesolate emotion of what they were seeing.Guards kept people at a respectful distance, and out of the labyrinth of roomsand hallways inside, now enclosed by upper floors, and in some places, roofs.Now that the statue was set in place, those guards moved in to clear the plazaentrance.Richard had only gotten a few hours of sleep in the last week. Now that thestatue was in place, exhaustion overwhelmed him. With all the work on top of solittle sleep, and little to eat, he was almost ready to drop where he stood.Victor appeared out of the long shadows. Some workers were leaving, but otherswould still be at it for several more hours. Richard hadn’t even realized thatit had taken the better part of the day to move the statue. With the heat of thework over, his sweat-soaked shirt felt like ice against his flesh.“Here,” Victor said, handing Richard a slice of lardo. “Eat. In celebration thatyou are done.”Richard thanked his friend before devouring the lardo. His head was pounding. Hehad done all he could do to show people what they needed to see. With the workdone, though, Richard felt suddenly lost. He realized only then how much hehated having finished, to be without the noble work. It had been his reason togo on.“Ishaq, I’m dead on my feet. Do you think you could give me a ride in your wagonpartway to my house?”Ishaq clapped Richard on the back. “Come, you can ride in the back. I’m sureJori would not mind. At least he can save you part of your walk. I must stayhere and see to the teams and wagons.”Richard thanked the smiling Victor. “In the morning, my friends, in the fulllight, we will remove the cover and see beauty one last time. After that . . .well, who knows.”“Tomorrow, then,” Victor said with his sly laugh. “I don’t think I will sleeptonight,” he called after Richard.The months of effort seemed to all come down upon him at once. He climbed intothe back of Ishaq’s wagon and bid the man a good night. As Ishaq left, Richardcurled up under a tarp to shut out the light and was asleep before Jorireturned. He was dead to the world as the wagon rolled away.Nicci watched as Richard departed with Ishaq. She wanted to do this on her own.She wanted it to be her part. She wanted to contribute something of value.Only then could she face him.She knew precisely how the Order would react to the statue. They would view itas a threat. They would not allow other people to see it. The Order woulddestroy it. It would be gone. No one would ever know about it.Twining her fingers together, she wondered how to proceed-what should be first.Then it came to her. She had gone to him before. He had helped Richard. He wasRichard’s friend. Nicci rushed across the sprawling site of the palace and upthe hill.She was winded by the time she reached the blacksmith’s shop. The grimblacksmith was putting away tools. He had already banked the fire in his forge.The smells, the sights, even the layer of iron dust and soot gave Nicci a joyfulflash of her father’s shop. She understood, now, the look that had been in herfather’s eyes. She doubted he had fully understood it himself, but she did, now.The blacksmith looked up without smiling as she rushed into his shop.“Mr. Cascella! I need you.”His frown grew. “What’s that matter? Why are you crying? Is it Richard? Havethey-”“No. Nothing like that.” She grabbed his meaty hand and tugged at him. It waslike tugging on a boulder. “Please. Come with me. It’s important.”He gestured with his other hand around at his shop. “But I have to clean up forthe night.”She yanked again on his hand. She felt tears stinging her eyes. “Please! This isimportant!”He wiped his free hand down his face. “Lead the way, then.”Nicci felt a little foolish pulling the burly blacksmith along by the hand asshe raced down the hill. He asked where they were going, but she didn’t answer.She wanted to get down there before the light was gone.When they reached the plaza, guards were patrolling up at the top of the steps,keeping everyone off the plaza. Nicci saw Ishaq nearby, loading long planks in awagon. She called to him, and, seeing the blacksmith with her, he ran over.“Nicci! What is it? You look a frightful-”“I have to show you both the statue. Now.”Victor’s scowl grew. “It will be unveiled tomorrow when Richard-”“No! You must see it now.”They both fell silent. Ishaq leaned close as he gestured covertly.“We can’t go up there. It’s guarded.”“I can.” Nicci angrily wiped the tears from her cheeks. Her voice regained thequality of grave authority she had wielded so often, that dark intonation thathad passed judgment on countless lives, and sent people to their death. “Waithere.”Both men pulled back at the menace in her eyes.Nicci straightened her back. She lifted her chin. She was a Sister of the Dark.She ascended the steps in a measured pace, as if the palace were hers. It was.She was the Slave Queen. These men were hers to command.She was Death’s Mistress.The guards approached her warily, sensing that the woman in black was a threat.Before they could speak, she spoke first.“What are you doing here?” she hissed.“What are we doing here?” one asked. “We’re guarding the emperor’s palace,that’s what we’re doing-”“How dare you talk back to me. Do you know who I am?”“Well . . . I don’t think I-”“Death’s Mistress. Perhaps you have heard of me?”All dozen men straightened. She saw their eyes take in the black dress again,then her long blond hair, her blue eyes. By their reaction to what they saw, itwas obvious to Nicci that her reputation preceded her. Before they could sayanother word, she spoke again.“And what do you suppose Emperor Jagang’s consort is doing here? Do you supposeI came without my master? Of course not, you idiots!”“The emperor. . .” several mumbled together in shock.“That’s right, the emperor is arriving for the dedication tomorrow. I have cometo make my own examination, first, and what do I find? Idiots! Here you stand,with your thumbs in your ears, while you should be standing to greet HisExcellency as he arrives into the city mere hours from now.”The guards’ eyes widened. “But . . . no one told us. Where is he coming in? Wehaven’t been informed-”“Arid do you suppose a man as important as Jagang wishes his whereabouts to beknown for any assassin in the neighborhood to find him? And if there areassassins about, here you fools stand!”All the men bowed urgently.“Where?” the sergeant asked. “Where is His Excellency arriving?”“He’s arriving from the north.”The man licked his lips. “But, but, which road from the north? There are anynumber of routes-”Nicci planted her fists on her hips. “Do you suppose His Excellency is going toannounce his route beforehand? And to the likes of you? If only one road wasguarded, then any assassin would know where to expect the emperor, now wouldn’tthey? All the roads are to be guarded! And here you stand, instead!”The men bobbed and bowed nervously, wanting to leave to do their duty, but notknowing where to go.Nicci gritted her teeth and leaned toward the sergeant. “Get your men out to oneof the north roads. Now. That is you duty. All the roads are to be guarded. Pickone!”The men bowed repeatedly as they sidestepped away. After scurrying only a fewfeet, they broke into a dead run. She watched them collect other guards as theywent.As they vanished out of the plaza, Nicci turned to the two startled men. Theyclimbed the stairs, now unhindered by guards. Some of the people treading thecobblestone paths, come to look at the carvings on the walls, had heard yellingand turned to watch what she was doing. Women on their knees, praying up at thecarvings in stone of the Light shining down on depraved people, looked overtheir shoulders.As Victor and Ishaq reached the top of the plaza, Nicci untied the line, grabbedthe linen in her fists, and ripped the shroud off the statue.Both men stopped in their tracks.In a half circle around the plaza, the walls were covered with the story ofman’s inadequacy. All around them, man was shown small, depraved, deformed,impotent, terrified, cruel, mindless, wicked, greedy, corrupt, and sinful. Hewas depicted forever torn between otherworldly forces controlling every aspectof his miserable existence, an existence incomprehensible in its caldron ofchurning evil, with death his only escape into salvation.Those who had found virtue in this world, under the protection of the Creator’sLight, looked lifeless, their faces without emotion, without awareness, theirbodies as unbending as cadavers. They stared out at the world through a vacant,mindless stupor, while all around them danced rats, through their legs wriggledsnakes, and over their heads flew vultures.In the vortex of this torrent of tortured life, this cataclysm of corruption,this depravity and debauchery, rose up Richard’s statue in bold, glowingopposition.It was a devastating indictment of all around it.The mass and weight of the ugliness surrounding Richard’s statue seemed toshrink back into insignificance. The evil of the wall carvings seemed now to becrying out at their own dishonesty in the face of incorruptible beauty andtruth.The two figures in the center posed in a state of harmonious balance. The man’sbody displayed a proud masculinity. Though the woman was clothed, there was nodoubt as to her femininity. They both reflected a love of the human form assensuous, noble, and pure. The evil all around seemed as if it was recoiling interror of that noble purity.More than that, though, Richard’s statue existed without conflict; the figuresshowed awareness, rationality, and purpose. This was a manifestation of humanpower, ability, intent. This was life lived for its own sake. This was mankindstanding proudly of his own free will.This was exactly what the single word at the bottom named it:LIFEThat it existed was proof of the validity of the concept.This was life as it should be lived-proud, reasoned, and a slave to no otherman. This was the rightful exaltation of the individual, the nobility of thehuman spirit.Everything on the walls all around offered death as its answer.This offered life.Victor and Ishaq were on their knees, weeping.The blacksmith lifted his arms up toward the statue before him, laughing astears ran down his face.“He did it. He has done as he said he would. Flesh in stone. Nobility. Beauty.”People who had come to see the other carvings, now began gathering to see whatstood in the center of the plaza. They stared with wide eyes, many seeing forthe first time the concept of man as virtuous in his own right. The statementwas so powerful that it alone invalidated everything up on the walls. That ithad been carved by man underscored its veracity.Many of them saw it with the same understanding Nicci had.The carvers wandered away from their work to come see what stood in the plaza.The masons came down from the scaffolding. The tenders set down their mortarbuckets. The carpenters climbed down from their work at setting beams. Thetilers laid aside their chisels. The drivers picketed their horses. Men diggingand planting the surrounding grounds set down their shovels. They came from alldirections toward the statue in the plaza.People flowed up the steps in ever expanding ranks. They flooded around thestatue, gazing in awe. Many fell to their knees weeping, not in misery as theyhad before, but with joy. Many, like the blacksmith, laughed, as tears ofdelight ran down their happy faces. A few covered their eyes in fear.As people took it in, they began to run off to get others. Soon, men were comingdown from the shops on the hill to see what stood in the plaza. Men and womenwho had come to watch the construction now ran off home to get loved ones, tobring them to see what stood at the emperor’s palace.It was something the like of which most of these people had never in their livesseen.It was vision to the blind.It was water to the thirsty.It was life to the dying."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 66Kahlan pulled her map out and took a quick look. It was hard to tell for sure.She glanced up and down the road and noted that the other buildings were notquite as well kept.“What do you think?” Cara asked in a low voice.Kahlan slipped the map back inside her mantle. She snugged the fur up over hershoulders a little, making sure it covered the hilt of Richard’s sword she worestrapped behind her shoulder. Her own sword was hidden under her cloak. At leastthe sun had just gone down.“I don’t know. We don’t have much light left. I guess there’s only one way to besure.”Cara eyed the people who looked their way. For the most part, everyone in thecity seemed remarkably incurious. With their horses stabled outside of the city,there would not be any swift escape if they needed to get away. The generalindifference of people, though, somewhat eased Kahlan’s concern.They had decided to simply be as aloof and casual as possible. She had thoughtthey looked pretty simple in their traveling clothes, but in a place as drab asAltur’Rang, the two of them had a hard time being inconspicuous. In retrospect,she wished they would have had the time to find something shabby to wear. Kahlanfelt they were about as inconspicuous as a pair of painted whores at a countryfarm fair.She climbed the stairs to the place as if she knew where she was going andbelonged there. Inside, the hallway was clean. It had the smell of freshlyscrubbed wood floors. With Cara close at her heels, Kahlan moved down to thefirst door on the right. She could see the stairway farther down the hall. Ifthis was the correct building, this would be the proper door.Looking both ways, Kahlan gently rapped on the door. No answer came. She knockedagain, a little louder. She tried the knob, but it was locked. After checkingthe hall again, she pulled a knife from her belt and worked it under themolding, springing it out until the door popped open. She grabbed Cara’s sleeveand pulled the woman in with her.Inside, they both struck a pose prepared to fight. There was no one in the room.In the light coming in from two windows, Kahlan saw first that there were twosleeping pallets. What she saw next was Richard’s pack.Kneeling on the floor in the far corner, she flipped back the flap and saw histhings inside-his war wizard’s clothes were in the bottom. Near tears, sheclutched the pack to her chest.It had been over a year since she had seen him. For almost half the time she hadknown him, he had been gone from her. It seemed she could not endure anothermoment.Kahlan heard a sudden noise. Cara seized the wrist of a young man as he chargedin brandishing a knife. In one fluid motion she had his arm twisted behind hisback.Kahlan thrust her hand into the air. “Cara! No.”Cara made a sour face as she lowered her Agiel from the young man’s throat. Hiseyes were wide with both fear, and indignation.“Thieves! You’re thieves! That’s not yours! Put it back!”Kahlan rushed to the youth, motioning for him to keep his voice down.“Is your name Kamil, or Nabbi?”The young man blinked in surprise. He licked his lips as he glanced over hisshoulder at the woman towering above him.“I’m Kamil. Who are you? How do you know my name?”“I’m a friend. Gadi told me-”“Then you’re no friend!”Before he could scream for help, Cara clamped a hand over his mouth.Kahlan shushed him. “Gadi murdered a friend of ours. After we captured him, Gaditold me your name.”When she saw that he was taken aback by the news, Kahlan signaled for Cara tolower her hand.“Gadi killed someone?”“That’s right,” Cara said.He stole a quick glance over his shoulder. “What did you do to him? To Gadi?”“We put him to death,” Kahlan said, not revealing the full extent of the deed.The young man smiled. “Then you really are friends. Gadi is a bad person. Hehurt my friend. I hope he suffered.”“It took him a long time to die,” Cara said.The young man swallowed when he saw her grin from over his shoulder. Kahlangestured and Cara released him.“So, who are you two?” he asked.“My name is Kahlan, and this is Cara.”“So, what are you doing here?”“That’s a little complicated, but we’re looking for Richard.”His suspicion returned. “Yeah?”Kahlan smiled. He was indeed Richard’s friend. She put her hand to the side ofhis shoulder as she held his gaze.“I’m his wife. His real wife.”Kamil blinked dumbly. “But, but-,,Kahlan’s voice hardened. “Nicci isn’t his wife.”-His eyes brimmed with tears as a grin overcame him. “I knew it. I knew he didn’tlove her. I could never understand how Richard could have married her.”Kamil suddenly threw his arms around Kahlan, hugging her with fierce happinessfor Richard. Kahlan laughed softly as she smoothed the young man’s hair. Caraseized his collar and pulled him back, but at least did it gently.“And you?” Kamil asked Cara.“I am Mord-”“Cara is Richard’s good friend.”Kamil unexpectedly hugged Cara, then. Kahlan feared the Mord-Sith might crushhis skull, but she endured it politely, even if she was ill at ease. Kahlanthought Cara might even have started to smile.Kamil turned back to Kahlan. “But what is Richard doing with Nicci, then?”Kahlan took a deep breath. “It’s a long story.”“Tell me.”Kahlan appraised his dark eyes for a moment. She liked what she saw there.Still, she thought it best to keep it simple.“Nicci is a sorceress. She used magic to force Richard to go with her.”“Magic? What magic?” he pressed without pause.Kahlan took another breath. “She could have used her magic to hurt me, kill me,if Richard didn’t agree to go with her.”Kamil gazed skyward as he thought it over. He finally nodded. “That makes sense.That’s the kind of man Richard is-he would do anything to save the woman heloved. I knew he didn’t love Nicci.”“And how did you know that?”Kamil gestured at the two pallets. “He didn’t sleep with her. I bet he sleptwith you, when you were together.”Kahlan could feel her face flushing at his boldness. “How do you know that?”“I don’t know.” He scratched his head. “You just look like you belong with him.When you say his name I can see how you care for him.”Kahlan couldn’t help but smile through her weariness. They had been riding at abreakneck pace for weeks. They had lost a few horses along the way, and had toacquire others. They had gone with little sleep for the last week. She hadtrouble even thinking straight.“So, do you know where Richard is, now?” Kahlan asked.“At work, I’m sure. He usually comes home about now-unless he has to work atnight, too.”Kahlan briefly scanned the room. “What about Nicci?”“I don’t know. She may have gone to buy bread or something. It’s a littlefunny-she’s usually home long before now. She almost always has dinner ready forRichard.”Kahlan’s gaze drifted through the darkening room, from table, to basin, tocupboard. She would hate to leave, only to have him show up a minute after sheleft. Kamil thought it was odd that Nicci wasn’t home. That they were both gonewas troubling.“Where does he work?” Kahlan asked.“At the site.”“Site? What site?”Kamil gestured into the distance. “Out at the emperor’s new palace they’rebuilding. Tomorrow’s the big dedication.”“The new palace is done?”“Oh, no. It’s years and years from being done. It’s only started, really. Butthey are going to dedicate it to the Creator, now. A lot of people have come toAltur’Rang for the ceremony.”“Richard is a laborer helping build the palace?”Kamil nodded. “He’s a carver. At least, he is now. He used to work at Ishaq’stransport company, but then he got arrested-”Kahlan seized him by the shirt. “He was arrested? They . . . tortured him?”Kamil’s eyes turned away from her frantic expression.“I gave Nicci my money so she could get in to see him. She and Ishaq and Victorthe blacksmith got him out. He was hurt bad. When he got better, the officialsmade him take a job carving.”Kamil’s words spun through her head. The ones that floated above all the restwere that Richard had recovered.“He carves statues, now?”Kamil nodded again. “He carves people in stone to decorate the walls of thepalace. He helps me with my own carvings. I can show you, out back.”Wonder of wonders. Richard carving. But all the carvings they had seen in theOld World were grotesque. Richard would not like to carve such ugliness.Obviously, he had no choice.“Maybe later.” Kahlan rubbed her fingers across her brow as she considered whatto do. “Can you take me there, now? To the site where Richard works?”“Yes, if you’d like. But don’t you want to wait to see if he comes home, first?He may be home soon.”“You said he works at night, sometimes.”“For the last few months, he worked at night a lot. He’s carving some specialstatue for them.” Kamil’s face brightened. “He told me to go tomorrow to see it.With the dedication tomorrow, it may be he’s still finishing it. I’ve never seenwhere he works, but Victor, the blacksmith, may know.”“We should go see this blacksmith, then.”Kamil scratched his head again as his expression turned to disappointment. “Butthe blacksmith will be gone for the night.”“Is there anyone else out there, now?”“There may be a lot of people there. Crowds go out there to see the place-I’vegone out there myself and tonight there may be more than usual, because oftomorrow’s ceremony.”That might be just what they needed. They wouldn’t look so out of placesearching the area for Richard if there were crowds out there. It would givethem an excuse to look around.“We’ll give him an hour,” Kahlan said. “If he doesn’t return by then, then it’smost likely because he’s working. If he doesn’t come back, we’ll have to go outthere and look for him.”“What if Nicci shows up?” Cara asked.Kamil waved his hand to dismiss their concern. “I’ll go out on the front stepsand watch for Nicci. You two can wait in here, where no one will see you. I’llcome warn you if I see Nicci coming up the street. I can always take you out theback way if I see her returning home.”Kahlan laid a hand over his shoulder and gave it a squeeze.“That sounds good to me, Kamil. We’ll wait in here.” Kamil hurried out to hisguard post. Kahlan glanced around the tidy room.“Why don’t you get some sleep,” Cara said. “I’ll stand guard. You stood guardlast.”Kahlan was exhausted. She glanced down at the sleeping pallet closest toRichard’s things, then nodded. She lay down on his bed. The room was gettingdark. Just being where he slept was a comfort. Being so close, but so far, shecouldn’t fall asleep.Nicci’s heart sank when she saw that Richard wasn’t in their room. Kamil wasnowhere to be found. She had felt so good out at the site, watching all thepeople come to see Richard’s statue. Throngs of people had come to see it andhad been uplifted.Some had been angered by it. She, of all people, understood that. Still, Niccicould hardly believe the hateful reaction of some people to such beauty. Somepeople hated life. She understood that, too. There were those who refused tosee-who didn’t want to see.Other people, though, had a reaction much like hers.It had all come clear for her. For the first time in her life, life made sense.Richard had tried to tell her, but she hadn’t listened. She had heard the truthbefore, too, but others-her mother, Brother Narev, the Order-had shouted itdown, and shamed her out of listening.Her mother had trained her well, and from the first day she had seen BrotherNarev, Nicci had been a soldier in the Order’s army.When she saw the statue, she saw at last the truth she had always refused tosee, suddenly and clearly standing before her. This was the valid vision of lifefor which she had hungered, yet which she had evaded, her entire life.She understood, now, why life had seemed so empty, so pointless: she herself hadrendered it so in refusing to think. Nicci had been a slave to everyone of need.She had given her masters their only real weapon against her; she hadsurrendered to their twisted lies by putting the crippling chains of guiltaround her own neck for them, giving herself freely into slavery to the whimsand wishes of others instead of living her life as she should have-for herself.She had never asked why it was right for her to be a slave to another’s desires,but not evil for them to enslave her. She was not contributing to the bettermentof mankind, but was merely a servant to countless puling little tyrants. Evilwas not one large entity, but a ceaseless torrent of small wrongs leftunchallenged, until they festered into monsters.She had lived her whole life on shifting quicksand, where reason and theintellect were not to be trusted, where only faith was valid, and blind faithwas sacred. She, herself, had enforced mindless conformity to that empty evil.She had helped bring everyone together, so they might have one collective neckaround which the worst among men, in the name of good, could put their leash.Richard had answered their tower of empty lies in one righteously beautifulstatement for all to see, and had punctuated it with the simple words on theback of the bronze sundial.Her life was hers to live by right. She belonged to no one.Freedom exists first and foremost in the mind of the rational, thinkingindividual-that was what Richard’s statue had shown her. That he had carved it,proved it. A captive of her and the Order, his ideals had risen above both.Nicci realized only now that she had always known her father held this samevalue-she had seen it in his eyes-even though he could never rationalize it. Hisvalues were expressed through the integrity of his work; that was why, from ayoung age, she had wanted to be an armorer like him. It was his vision of lifeshe had always loved and admired, but suppressed, because of Mother and her ilk.It was that same look in Richard’s eyes, that same value for life held dear,that had drawn Nicci to him.Nicci knew now that she had worn black ever since her mother’s death in anendless, shapeless longing to bury not just her mother’s hold over her, but,more important, her mother’s evil ideals.She was so sorry Richard wasn’t home. She wanted to tell him that he had givenher the answer she had sought. She could never ask his forgiveness, though. Whatshe had done to him was beyond forgiveness. She saw that now. The only thing shecould do now was to reverse the wrong she had done.As soon as she found him, they would leave. They would go back to the New World.They would find Kahlan. Then, Nicci would set things right. She had to be closeto Kahlan, at least within sight, in order to undo the spell. Then Kahlan wouldbe free. Then Richard would be free.As much as Nicci loved Richard, she understood, now, that he should be withKahlan, the woman he loved. Her desire for him gave her no right to do as shehad done. She had no right to another’s life, as they had no right to hers.Nicci lay down in her bed and wept at the thought of the outrage she had done tothem both. She was overcome with shame. She had been so blind for so long.She could not believe how she had thrown her entire life away fighting for eviljust because it claimed to be good. She truly had been a Sister of the Dark.She at least could work to correct the harm she had caused.Kahlan could hardly believe the size of the crowd. By the light of the moonbrightening the thin layer of hazy clouds, and by torches here and therethroughout the valley, it looked like the open area as far as she could see waspacked with people. The numbers had to be in the hundreds of thousands.Thunderstruck, Kamil threw up his arms. “It’s the middle of the night. I’venever seen so many people out here. What are they all doing here?”“How would we know?” Cara sniped. She was in a foul mood, unhappy that theyhadn’t found Richard, yet.The city had been crowded with people, too. With the city guards prowling thestreets, uneasy about all the late-night activity, it had been necessary torestrain their eagerness in favor of caution. It had taken them hours to get outto the site by way of back streets, dark roads, and Kamil’s guided tour ofalleyways.The lad pointed. “It’s up there.”They followed him up a road lined with workshops, most closed up and dark. A fewhad men inside, still working at benches by the light of lamps or candles.Kahlan reached under her cloak and curled her fingers around the hilt of hersword when she saw a man running in their direction. He saw them and skidded toa halt.“Have you seen it?”“Seen what?” Kahlan asked.He pointed excitedly. “Down at the palace. In the plaza.” He started runningagain. He called behind as he went. “I have to go get my wife and sons. Theyhave to see it.”Kahlan and Cara shared a look in the near darkness.Kamil ran over to a shop and tugged on a door, but it was shut up tight. “Victorisn’t here.” His voice couldn’t conceal his disappointment. “It’s too late.”“Do you know what’s down in the plaza?” Kahlan asked him.He thought a moment. “The plaza? I know the place, but . . . wait, that’s whereRichard told me to go. The plaza. He said to go to the plaza tomorrow.”“Let’s go down there now and have a look,” Kahlan said.Kamil waved a hand, pointing. “This is the shortest way, down the hill behindthe blacksmith shop.”So jammed was the place with people, that it took them over an hour just to makeit down the hill and across the expanse of grounds around the palace. Eventhough it was the middle of the night, more people kept arriving all the time.Once they reached the palace, Kahlan discovered that they couldn’t get to theplaza. There was a huge mob of people stretching back forever along the frontwall, waiting to go up to the plaza. When Kahlan, Cara, and Kamil tried to goaround and get up there to see what was going on, it nearly started a riot.People had been waiting a long time to reach the plaza, and they didn’t likehaving others try to push ahead. Kahlan saw several men try to get ahead bygoing around the waiting crowd. They were set upon by the mob.Cara pulled her hand out from under her cloak and casually showed Kahlan herAgiel.Kahlan shook her head. “Long odds with Jagang’s army are one thing, but thethree of us against a few hundred thousand does not sound good to me.”“Really?” Cara asked. “I thought it roughly even.”Kahlan only smiled. Even Cara knew better than to go against a mob. Kamilfrowned in puzzlement at Cara’s humor. When they found the back of the line,they melted in.It wasn’t long before the line behind them grew so large that they could nolonger see the back end winding out into the grounds. The people all aroundseemed filled with a strange kind of nervous expectancy.A round woman in front, bundled up in little more than rags, turned a plump grinon them. She held out what looked like a loaf of bread.“Would you like some?” she asked.“Thank you, no,” Kahlan said. “But that’s very kind of you to offer.”“I’ve never made such an offer, before.” The woman giggled. “Seems the rightthing to do, now, doesn’t it?”Kahlan had no idea what the woman was talking about, but said, “Yes, it does.”Throughout the night, the line inched along. Kahlan’s back ached painfully. Sheeven saw Cara grimace as she stretched.“I still think we just ought to draw weapons and get up there,” Cara finallycomplained.Kahlan leaned in close. “What difference does it make? Where have we to gobefore morning? When morning comes, we can go up to the blacksmith’s place or tothe carving areas over there and hopefully find Richard, but we can do nothingtonight.”“Maybe he will be at his room, now.”“You want to run into Nicci again? You know what she’s capable of. The next timewe may not be so lucky to escape. We haven’t come all this way to battle her-Ijust want to see Richard. Even if Richard goes back there-and we don’t know thathe will-we do know he’s got to return here in the morning.”“I suppose,” Cara grouched.The sky was taking on a faint reddish glow by the time they made it to the footof the marble steps. They could hear moaning and wailing up ahead. Kahlancouldn’t see the cause, but people up on the plaza were weeping freely. Oddlyenough, some people could be heard to laugh joyfully. A few others cursed, as ifthey had been robbed of their life savings at the point of a knife.As they slowly made their way up the steps, Kahlan and Cara tried to stay lowbehind the people surrounding them so as not to draw attention to themselves.The plaza above was lit by dozens of torches, their flickering light giving anindication of the vastness of the crowds. The smell of the burning pitch mixedsourly with the stale sweat of the packed multitude.Through a momentary gap between people in front of her, Kahlan snatched a quickglance ahead. She blinked at what she saw, but it was gone almost as fast as shesaw it, screened by the throng. The people ahead wept some it sounded, with joy.Kahlan began to make out the polite voices of men asking the crowd to keepmoving, imploring them to give others a chance. The ragtag collection of peoplesteadily advanced up onto the white marble of the plaza, like beggars at acoronation. The torchlight was finally being replaced by radiant daylight as thesun cleared the horizon. Golden rays washed the face of the palace.The scenes carved in the stone up on the walls were disturbing. If they were anydifferent from the others she had seen in the Old World, it was only in thatthey were more gruesome, more horrifying, more desolately hopeless, and moreplentiful.Kahlan’s mind played over the lines of her statue of Spirit. The idea of Richardhaving to carve such things as she saw up on the walls sickened her.She felt a sense of gloom overcoming her. This was the Order: pain, suffering,death. This was what was in store for the New World at the hands of thesemonsters. She couldn’t take her eyes from the scenes on the walls, from the fatethat awaited the people of her homeland-the fate so many blindly embraced.Then, all of a sudden, as the people shuffled around and past, Kahlan beheld thewhite marble figures rising up before her. The sight took her breath in a gasp.The rays of dawn lit them as if the sun itself had risen just to caress thelustrous forms in all their glory.Cara gripped Kahlan’s arm, her fingers digging in painfully as she, too, wastaken by the sight. The statue of the man and woman seized Kahlan’s imaginationwith their nobility of spirit.She felt tears run down her cheeks, and then she was weeping openly, like thepeople around her, at the majesty, the dignity, the beauty, of what stood beforeher. It was everything the carvings on the walls all around were not. It offeredfreely everything they denied.LIFE, it said at the base.Kahlan had to gasp through her tears to draw breath. She clutched at Cara’s arm,and Cara clutched at hers, the two of them holding on to each other for supportas the crowd swept them along in a current of shared emotion. The man in thestatue was not Richard, but there was much of Richard in it. The woman was notKahlan, but there was enough of her form in it that Kahlan felt her faceflushing at others seeing it.“Please look and move along so that others may view it too,” the men at thesides kept calling. They weren’t wearing uniforms; they were as tattered-lookingas everyone else. They appeared to be ordinary citizens who had just stepped into help.The woman who had offered the bread fell to her knees in wailing. Armsrespectfully lifted her and helped her to move on. The woman, living in the OldWorld, had probably never seen a thing of such beauty.As Kahlan shuffled around the statue, unable to take her eyes from it, shereached out to touch it, as did everyone else. As she was carried past, herfingers met the smooth flesh in stone, knowing it was also where Richard’sfingers had been. She wept all the harder.As she moved past, Kahlan saw then that the curve of the sundial had words onthe back:“Your life is yours alone. Rise up and live it.”The words were visible on the lips of many who saw them.The crowd kept coming up the steps, forcing the people around the statue to moveon. Men at the rear guided people between the columns, out through the rear ofthe partially built palace, and out of the way so that others could come up toview the statue.“I wish Benjamin could see this,” Cara said, her blue eyes brimming with tears.Kahlan was overcome with a burble of laughter. “I was going to say, `I wishRichard could see it.”“Cara laughed with her as they were swept away by the river of people.Kamil grabbed Kahlan’s hand. She saw him take Cara’s, too. “Yeah,” he said withauthority, “Richard carved it.”“Where to?” Kahlan asked him. “Where do you think we can find him?”“I guess we should make our way back up to the blacksmith’s place. Hopefully,Richard will show up there. If not, maybe Victor will know where he is.”Kamil’s words, “Richard carved it,” rang joyfully through her mind."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 67Richard climbed through the high window and dropped to the ground, his bootshitting with a thud. He could hardly believe he had slept the whole night undera tarp in the back of a wagon. He could hardly believe that Jori didn’t wake himso he could go home when they were close. The man probably didn’t think it washis job, and so he wouldn’t do it. Richard sighed. Maybe Jori hadn’t known hewas in the back.Richard brushed himself off. He stood outside the transport company buildingwhere he used to work when he had first come to Altur’Rang, and where he hadbeen locked in all night. Of course, he had been asleep, so he didn’t know Jorihad locked him inside.Richard didn’t know where to go-home, or to the Retreat. The sky glowed orangeand violet in the bright sunrise. He supposed there was no point in going home;that would only make him late to work. He decided he had better get to work.Work. What work? This was the day of the celebration, the dedication. WhenBrother Narev saw the statue, Richard was not going to have to worry about workanymore.He knew that if he ran, tried to escape, it would only trigger Nicci’s anger,and then Kahlan’s life would be forfeit. Richard had spent over a year withNicci-as long a time as he had spent with Kahlanand Nicci repeatedly had madeclear his choices. Kahlan’s life was always the price in the balance.Richard had no real choice. At least he would get to see Victor’s face when hesaw the statue. Richard smiled at that thought. It was the only pleasantprospect the day held.The day was most likely to end in the wet dark hole where he had been before. Hemissed a step at that thought. He didn’t want to go back into that place. It wasso small. Richard didn’t like being trapped-especially in small places. Hedidn’t like either of those concepts; together, they were terrifying.As fearful as the prospect of such a fate was, he had carved the statue withconscious intent and with forethought, knowing the probability of the eventualprice. What he had accomplished was worth that price. Slavery was not life.Nicci had once promised him that if he died, or chose death, that would initself be her answer, and she would not harm Kahlan. Now, Richard could only puthis faith in that promise.The statue existed. That was what mattered. Life existed. People needed to seethat. So many people in the Old World needed to see that life existed, and wasto be lived.For so early in the morning, there was an unusual amount of activity on thestreets of Altur’Rang. Now and again, squads of heavily armed city guards rusheddown the streets. There were a lot of people come to the city for the dedicationcelebration. He supposed that was why there were so many people out on thestreets.The guards paid him no attention. He knew they soon would.When he arrived at the Retreat, Richard was shocked by what he saw. The openmiles of grounds were covered with people. They crowded in around the palacewalls like ants around spilled honey. He couldn’t even begin to estimate howmany people blanketed the surrounding hills. It was disorienting to see thepanoply of color where before he had seen only brown dirt and green winter rye.He had no idea that this many people had wanted to come to the dedication. Butthen, he had been working day and night for months--how would he hear whatpeople planned?Richard skirted the worst of the throngs and made his way up the road toward theblacksmith’s shop. He wanted to get Victor and go down with him to the site tosee the statue before the Order came out to begin the dedication. Victor wouldno doubt be eagerly waiting.The road was crowded with people. They seemed excited, happy, and expectant. Itwas a far cry from the way most people in the Old World usually appeared orbehaved. Maybe a celebration, even one such as this, was better than the rest oftheir dreary days.A half mile from Victor’s place, a wild-looking Brother Neal leaped into theroad and thrust an arm in Richard’s direction.“There he is! Grab him!”Guards combing throughout the surrounding crowds drew weapons at Neal’s command.As they swept in around him, Richard’s first instinct was to fight. In aninstant, he had assessed the enemy and calculated his attack. He had only tograb one sword from a clumsy guard and he would have them all. In his own mind,the grisly deed was already done. He had only to bring it to reality.The guards came at him in a dead run. People scattered out of the way, somescreaming in fright.There was the matter of Neal, though. Neal was a wizard. But Richard could dealwith that threat, too-need powered his ability. Need, and anger. He certainlyhad enough anger for the task. That part of him that the Sword of Truth used,that rage of dark violence, already thundered through him.Except that Nicci had told him that if he used his magic, Kahlan would die.Would she know?Sooner or later, she would.Richard stood submissively still as the guards roughly seized him by his arms tosubdue him. Others snatched his shirt from behind.What did it really matter? If he resisted, it would only hurt Kahlan. If theyexecuted him, Nicci would let Kahlan live her life.But he didn’t want to go back into that dark hole.Neal raced up, shaking a finger in Richard’s face. “What is the meaning of this,Cypher! What did you think you were going to accomplish!”“May I ask what are you talking about, Brother Neal?”Neal’s face was crimson. “The statue!”“What, you don’t like it?”With all his might, Neal slammed his fist into Richard’s middle. The guardsholding him laughed. Richard had seen it coming and had tightened his muscles,but it still drove the wind from him. He finally managed to draw his breath.Neal found that he enjoyed administering punishment, and did it again.“Oh, you’re going to pay for your blasphemy, Cypher. You’re going to pay theprice, this time. You’ll confess to it all, before we’re done. But first, you’llwatch your wicked perversion destroyed.” Neal, his face twisted with superior,selfrighteous indignation, gestured to the burly guards. “Let’s get him downthere. And don’t be shy about making way through the crowd.”By midmorning, Kahlan’s hopes of the blacksmith showing up had all but vanished.“I’m sorry,” Kamil said, looking glum as he watched her pace. “I don’t know whyVictor isn’t here. I thought he would be, I really did.”Kahlan finally halted and gave the worried lad a pat on the shoulder. “I knowyou did, Kamil. With the celebration today, and with what’s going on down therewith the statue, this is hardly a normal day around here, I’m sure.”“Look,” Cara said. Kahlan saw she was peering down toward the palace. “Guardswith spears are moving the crowd off the plaza.”Kahlan squinted off down at the hill. “Your eyes are better than mine. I can’ttell.” She cast a frustrated glare at the closed blacksmith’s shop. “But it’sdoing us no good waiting up here. Let’s see if we can make it down there and geta better look.” Kahlan put a restraining hand on Cara’s arm. “But let’s notstart a war with this crowd?”Cara’s mouth twisted in exasperation. Kahlan turned to the young man kicking atoe at the dirt, looking shamed by his failed plan to help them find Richard.“Kamil, will you do something for me?”“Sure. What?”“Will you wait up here, in case Richard comes here, or even the blacksmith? Ifthe blacksmith comes to his shop, he might know something.”Kamil stretched his neck and gazed down at the palace. “Well, all right. IfRichard does come here, I wouldn’t want him to miss you. What shall I tell him,if I see him.Kahlan smiled. That I love him, she thought, but said instead, “Tell him I’mhere, with Cara, and we’ve gone down there looking for him. If he does show up,I don’t want to miss him. Have him wait here-we’ll come back.”Kahlan thought they could make it down to the plaza to have a look, but everyoneelse seemed to have the same idea. It took forever just to make it down the hillto the grounds. The closer they got, the tighter the people were jammedtogether. Kahlan’s progress ground to a halt. It was a struggle just to keepcontact with Cara. Everyone in the crowd seemed intent on squeezing forwardtoward the plaza. More people crushed in all the time.Kahlan soon realized that she and Cara were trapped in the press of people.The conversation on everyone’s lips was about only one thing: the statue.It was late in the day by the time Nicci had worked herself partway toward theplaza. Every inch gained had been a struggle. She was close enough to see thepeople up around the statue, but she could get no closer. Try as she might, shecould not make any more headway. Just like her, everyone else wanted to getcloser, too. They were pressed up against her, pinning her arms. It was at timesa frightening, helpless feeling. She managed to pull one arm free so she couldhelp herself maintain her balance. It came to her that to fall in suchcircumstances could be fatal.If only she had her power.Her own arrogance had driven her to trading it away. What she had gotten inreturn, though, was life. But it had cost Richard and Kahlan their freedom.Nicci couldn’t simply withdraw her power from the link, in order to have use ofher gift again, or Kahlan would die. Nicci didn’t want her life at the cost ofanother’s-that was what she had come to understand was true evil.Nicci had searched for Richard. She hadn’t found him. She hadn’t been able tofind the blacksmith, Mr. Cascella, or Ishaq, either. As soon as she could findRichard, she could tell him that she had been wrong, and then they could leaveAltur’Rang. She wanted so much to see his face when she told him she was takinghim back to Kahlan and that she was going to reverse the spell. Of all people,they were the last who should have to suffer for what Nicci had learned.The only place left that she could think to look for him was at the statue. Hemight be there. Try as she might, though, she couldn’t get any closer. Now, sherealized that she probably couldn’t even extract herself from the crush ofhundreds of thousands of people around her. There had to be well over a halfmillion people in the huge throng around the palace.And then, Nicci saw Brother Narev and his disciples appear up on the plaza, allin their dark brown robes, Brother Narev in his creased cap, the rest with theirfaces hidden in deeply cowled hoods. Crowding the rear of the plaza were a fewhundred officials of the Order who had traveled in to attend the palacededication-important men, all.If only she had her power, she could have killed them where they stood.It was then that she caught a fleeting glimpse of Richard behind the. officials,with guards surrounding him. The whole central area around the plaza was thickwith the surly guards.Brother Narev stepped out to the edge of the plaza, all angles under dark robes.Beneath his creased cap, beneath his hooded brow, his dark gaze swept theassembly. The people were in a noisy, emotional state. Brother Narev did notlook pleased, but then, Brother Narev never looked pleased. Pleasure, he wouldsay, was wicked. He raised his anus, commanding silence.When the crowd quieted, he began in that terrible grating voice of his, a voicethat had haunted her from that day in her house when she was little, that voicethat she had allowed to rule her mind, that voice that, along with her mother’s,had done her thinking for her.“Fellow citizens of the Order. We have a special event planned for you today.Today, we bring you the spectacle of temptation . . . and more.”His arm glided back toward the statue. His long thin fingers opened. His voicerumbled with revulsion. “Evil, itself.”The crowd murmured uneasily. Brother Narev smiled, the thin slash of his mouthpleating back his hollow cheeks as he grinned like death’s own skull. His eyeswere as dark as his robes. The setting sun was fleeing the scene, takingclarity, leaving behind the tremors of flickering light from the dozens oftorches to cast their flickering orange light across the massive columnstowering behind the plaza, and the weak light of the moon to wash the faces ofthe grim officials. The air, so cloying with the heavy scents of the crowd, hadturned chill.“Fellow citizens of the Order,” Brother Narev said in a voice that Nicci thoughtmight crack the stone walls, “today you will see what happens to evil, whenconfronted by the virtue of the Order.”He hooked a skeletal finger, signaling behind the heads of the officials. Guardsmuscled Richard forward. Nicci cried out, but her voice was lost in the clamorof tens of thousands of other voices.Brother Neal swaggered forward, then, lugging with him a sledgehammer.Nicci checked to the sides and saw that there were several thousand armed guardsat hand. More screened the plaza off from the people. Brother Narev had taken nochances. Neal, with a polite smile and a deferential bow, handed thesledgehammer to Brother Narev.Brother Narev lifted the sledgehammer above his head as if it were a sword heldhigh in triumph.“Evil, wherever it is found, must be destroyed.” He aimed the weaving head ofthe sledgehammer toward the statue. “This is a thing of evil, created by anextremist who hates his fellow man, to victimize the weak. He contributesnothing to the advancement of his fellow man, nothing to the succor of hisfellow man, nothing to the education or support of his fellow man. He offersonly lewd and profane images to prey on the susceptible and feebleminded amongus.”The crowd was silent in their bewildered disappointment. From what Nicci couldtell as she had walked among them throughout the day, they had come to believethat this statue was some new offering by the Order to the people-some grandthing for them to see at the emperor’s palace, some bright shining hope. Theywere confused and stunned by what they were hearing.Brother Narev lifted the sledgehammer. “Before this criminal’s corpse is hungfrom a pole for his crimes against the Order, he is to see his vile workdestroyed to the cheers of virtuous people!”As the sun’s last ray fled below the horizon, Brother Narev lifted the heavysledgehammer high in the flickering light of smoking torches. The sledgehammerwobbled momentarily at the apex of its arc before descending in a heavy swing.The crowd sent up a collective gasp as the steel head rang out when it struckthe male statue’s leg. A few small chips fell away. It had done surprisinglylittle damage.In the absolute silence, Richard laughed derisively at Brother Narev’s impotentswing.Even from the distance, Nicci could see Brother Narev’s face turning crimson asRichard stood watching and chuckling. The crowd murmured, hardly able to believeany man would laugh at a brother of the Order-at Brother Narev himself.Brother Narev could hardly believe it.The dozens of guards who had their spears leveled at Richard could hardlybelieve it.In the tense silence, Richard’s laugh echoed off the semicircle of stone wallsand soaring columns behind them. Death’s grin returned. Brother Narev lifted thesledgehammer by the head, its weight awkward in his bony hand, and held thehandle out to Richard.“You will destroy your depraved work yourself.”The words “or you will die on the spot” were not spoken, but everyone heard themimplied.Richard accepted the handle of the sledgehammer. He could have looked no morenoble doing so if he had been taking a jewel-encrusted sword.Richard’s raptor gaze left Brother Narev and swept out over the crowd as he tookseveral strides toward the steps. Brother Narev lifted a finger, signaling theguards to hold their spears. By the smirk on the faces of Brothers Narev andNeal, they didn’t think the crowd would care to hear anything a sinner had tosay.“You are ruled,” Richard said in a voice that rang out over the multitude, “bymean little men.”The people gasped as one. To speak against a brother was treason, most likely,and heresy for sure.“My crime?” Richard asked aloud. “I have given you something beautiful to see,daring to hold the conviction that you have a right to see it if you wish. Worse. . . I have said that your lives are your own to live.”A rolling murmur swept out through the multitude. Richard’s voice rose in power,demanding in its clarity to be heard above the whispering.“Evil is not one large entity, but a collection of countless, small depravitiesbrought up from the muck by petty men. Living under the Order, you have tradedthe enrichment of vision for a gray fog of mediocrity-the fertile inspiration ofstriving and growth, for mindless stagnation and slow decay-the brave new groundof the attempt, for the timid quagmire of apathy.”With gazes riveted and lips still, the crowd listened. Richard gestured out overtheir heads with his sledgehammer, wielded with the effortless grace of a royalsword.“You have traded freedom not even for a bowl of soup, but worse, for the spokenempty feelings of others who say that you deserve to have a full bowl of soupprovided by someone else.“Happiness, joy, accomplishment, achievement . . . are not finite commodities,to be divided up. Is a child’s laughter to be divided up and allotted? No!Simply make more laughter!”Laughter, pleased laughter, rippled through the crowd.Brother Narev’s scowl grew. “We’ve heard enough of your extremist rambling!Destroy your profane statue. Now.”Richard cocked his head. “Oh? The collective assembly of the Order, and ofbrothers, fears to hear what one insignificant man could say? You fear merewords that much, Brother Narev?”Dark eyes stole a quick glance at the crowd as they leaned forward, eager tohear his answer.“We fear no words. Virtue is on our side, and will prevail. Speak yourblasphemy, so all may understand why moral people will side against you.”Richard smiled out at the people, but he spoke with brutal honesty.“Every person’s life is theirs by right. An individual’s life can and mustbelong only to himself, not to any society or community, or he is then but aslave. No one can deny another person their right to their life, nor seize byforce what is produced by someone else, because that is stealing their means tosustain their life. It is treason against mankind to hold a knife to a man’sthroat and dictate how he must live his life. No society can be more importantthan the individuals who compose it, or else you ascribe supreme importance, notto man, but to any notion that strikes the fancy of that society, at anever-ending cost of lives. Reason and reality are the only means to just laws;mindless wishes, if given sovereignty, become deadly masters.“Surrendering reason to faith in these men sanctions their use of force toenslave you-to murder you. You have the power to decide how you will live yourlife.These mean little men up here are but cockroaches, if you say they are. Theyhave no power to control you but that which you grant them!”Richard pointed with the sledgehammer back at the statue. “This is life. Yourlife. To live as you choose.” He swept the head of the sledgehammer in an arc,pointing out the carvings up on the walls. “This is what the Order offers you:death.”“We’ve heard enough of your blasphemy!” Brother Narev shrieked. “Destroy yourevil creation now, or die!”The spears rose.Richard calmly swept a fearless glance around at the guards, then stepped to hisstatue. Nicci’s heart was pounding against her ribs. She didn’t want itdestroyed. It was too good to destroy. This couldn’t be happening. They couldn’ttake this away.Richard rested the sledgehammer across his shoulder. He lifted his other hand upto the statue as he addressed the crowd one last time.“This is what the Order is taking from you-your humanity, your individuality,your freedom to live your own life.”Richard briefly touched the sledgehammer to his forehead.With a mighty swing, the steel head arced around. Nicci could hear the airwhistle. The entire statue seemed to shudder as the sledgehammer struck the basewith a thunderous boom.In a moment of brittle silence, she heard the faintest sound, the rippingpopping crackling whisper of the stone itself.Then, the entire statue crashed down in a roar of fragments and billowing whitedust.The officials at the back of the plaza cheered. The guards hooted and holleredas they waved their weapons in the air.They were the only ones. The crowd was dead silent as dust rolled out across theplaza. All their hope, embodied in the statue, had just been destroyed.Nicci stared in a daze. Her throat constricted with the agony of it. Her eyeswatered. They all watched, as if having just witnessed a tragic, pointlessdeath.The guards moved toward Richard with their spears leveled, prodding him back toother guards waiting with heavy shackles.Down closer to the steps, a clear voice rang out from the stunned crowd. “No!We’ll not stand for it!”In the gathering darkness, Nicci saw the man who had yelled. He was up close tothe front, furiously trying to fight his way through the press of people to getto the plaza.It was the blacksmith, Mr. Cascella.“We’ll not stand for it!” he roared. “I’ll not let you enslave me any longer! Doyou hear? I’m a free man! A free man!”The entire mass of people before the palace erupted in a deafening roar.And then, as one, they lunged forward.Fists in the air, voices raised in cries of rage, the mass of humanityavalanched toward the plaza. Ranks of heavily armed men marched down the stepsto meet the advance. They vanished beneath the onslaught.Nicci screamed with all her might, trying to get Richard’s attention, but hervoice was lost in the hurricane."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 68Richard didn’t know what stunned him more: to see his statue in rubble, or tosee the crowd charging up the steps after Victor had declared himself a freeman.The mob rolled without pause over armed guards descending the steps to meetthem. A number of people fell wounded or killed. The bodies were trampledbeneath the surge of people. Those in front couldn’t stop if they wanted to-theweight of tens of thousands behind them propelled them onward. But they didn’twant to stop. The roar was deafening.The brothers panicked. The officials in the rear panicked. The few thousandarmed guards panicked. In that instant, the nature of the world transformed fromthe omnipotent power of the Order assembled on the plaza, to every man forhimself.Richard wanted Brother Narev. He saw, instead, armed men rushing in at him.Richard swung and buried the head of the sledgehammer in the chest of a man whocame at him with sword raised high. As the man flew past, the handle of thesledgehammer sticking from the crater in his chest, Richard snatched the swordfrom his fist, and then, blade in hand, he unleashed himself.A small group of guards saw fit to protect the brothers. Richard charged intothem, cutting with every stroke. Every slash or thrust took a man down.But guards were not what Richard was mainly interested in. If he was to loseeverything, he wanted Narev’s head in the bargain. As he fought his way throughthe chaos of people crushing into the plaza, he couldn’t find Brother Narevanywhere.Victor appeared out of the melee gripping a brother by the hair. Other men hadjoined Victor-and each had a hand on the brother. The burly blacksmith wore ascowl that would bend iron. The brother’s eyes were rolling around as if he’dbeen hit on the head, and couldn’t gather his senses.“Richard!” Victor called out.The men, some still grasping the brother’s brown robes, rushed in aroundRichard. They stood in a sweep around him, ten or fifteen deep.“What should we do with him?” one man asked.Richard glanced around at all the people. He saw men he knew from the site.Priska was among them, and Ishaq, too.“Why ask me? It’s your revolt.” He met the eyes of the men with challenge. “Whatdo you think you should do with him?”“You tell us, Richard,” one of the carvers said.Richard shook his head. “No. You tell me what you intend to do with him. But youshould know, this man is a wizard. When he comes around, he’s going to startkilling people. This is a matter of life and death, and he knows it. Do you?This is about your lives. It is for you to decide what to do, not me.”“We want you with us this time, Richard,” Priska called out. “But if you stillwon’t join us, then we’re having our lives back, having this revolt, withoutyou. That’s the way it’s going to be!”The men all shook their fists as they yelled their agreement.Victor hugged the groggy brother to his chest and wrenched his head until hisneck broke. The limp body slipped to the floor.“And that’s what we intend to do with him,” Victor said.Richard held out his hand as he smiled. “Always glad to meet a free man.” Theyclasped forearms. Richard looked into Victor’s eyes. “I’m Richard Rahl.”Victor blinked; then his belly laugh rolled out. With his free hand, he clappedRichard on the side of his shoulder.“Sure you are. We all are! You had me going for a second, there, Richard. Youreally did.”The press of the crowd drove them back to the columns. Richard reached down andsnatched the dead brother’s robes, pulling the body along with him. The mass oftowering stone walls and marble columns afforded some protection from the ragingriver of people.The ground shuddered. A blast from the inside blew a hole out through the wall.The darkness ignited with light. Stone fragments whistled through the air.Dozens of bloodied people were thrown back.“What was that!” Victor called out through the din of screaming, yelling, andthe roar of the explosion.Ignoring the danger, the crowd continued to advance on the men who had enslavedthem. Throngs swarmed over the spot where the statue had stood, scooping upshards of marble. They kissed their fingers and, as they swept past, plantedthose kisses on the words on the back of the fallen bronze ring. They werechoosing life.Hordes of people had captured a number of the brothers and officials, and werebeating them to death with chunks of white marble from the rubble of the statue.“Brother Narev is a sorcerer,” Richard said. “Victor, you have to organize someof these men-get control of this mob. Narev can use powerful magic. I commendpeople’s desire to be free, but we’re going to have a great many killed andinjured if we don’t get this under control.”“I understand,” Victor said as he fought to keep from being swept away.A number of men who had been crowded around Richard, protecting him, heard whathe said and nodded their agreement. The commands to organize started to spreadthrough the crowd. These people wanted to succeed. They were willing to worktoward their goal, and saw reason in the orders beginning to be called out. Manyof these men were used to handling large groups of workers. They knew thebusiness of organizing men.Richard started pulling off the dead brother’s robes. “You men have to keepthese people out of the palace. Narev is in there. Anyone who goes in couldeasily be killed. You have to keep people out. It will be a death trap in therewith the brothers.”“I understand,” Victor said.“We’ll keep them back,” men called to Richard.Richard threw the dead brother’s brown robes up over his head. Victor snatchedhim by the arm. “What are you doing?”Richard popped his head up through the neck opening. “I’m going in there. In thedarkness, Narev will think I’m a brother, and I’ll be able to get close to him.”He poked his confiscated sword through the robes to hide the blade. He coveredthe hilt with his wrist. “Keep people out Narev commands dangerous magic. I haveto stop him.”“You watch yourself,” Victor said.The men who had assumed command began fanning out, urging people to follow theirorders. Some people did, and as they did, yet more followed. With all theofficials who they’d captured now dead, the mob was slowly being brought totask, and not a moment too soon. The crushing weight of people flooding up ontothe plaza was a danger to everyone.Passing people wept as they picked up pieces of marble from the statue, holdingthe tokens of freedom and beauty to their breast as they moved on to allowothers to do the same. These were people who had been offered life, and hadtaken it. They had proven themselves.Victor saw what everyone was doing. “Richard . . . I’m so sorry-”A fiery blast exploded through the plaza, cutting down well over a hundredpeople. Bodies were ripped apart in the violence of it. A huge stone columntoppled, crushing people who couldn’t get out of the way because of the press ofthe throng.“Later!” Richard yelled over the pandemonium. “I’ve got to stop Narev! Keepthese people out-they’ll only die in there!”Victor nodded before he rushed off with the other men he knew to try to gaincontrol of the situation.Richard put the tumult and confusion behind him, and stepped through a gapingdoorway between the columns . . . into the darkness.There were miles of unfinished corridors, some clogged with bodies. In the firstcrush, as the people swept up onto the plaza, they had chased brothers andofficials into the labyrinth of the palace. Many of those people had beenunfortunate enough to find Brother Narev. The stench of burned flesh filledRichard’s nostrils as he moved silently through the darkness.Richard had been a woods guide long before he became the Seeker, long before hebecame Lord Rahl. Darkness was his element. In his mind, he gathered that cloakof darkness around himself.Within the massive stone walls, under the heavy beams, partial wooden floors,and slate roofs overhead, the riot of the crowd was a distant, echoing rumble.Through the gaping openings of undressed doorways stood rooms without roofs orfloors above, allowing in a flood of moonlight. It all created a tangled mesh ofshadows and faint light that suggested every form of danger.Richard came across an older woman lying bleeding in the hall, whimpering inagony. He bent to one knee, putting a hand gently to her shoulder as he kept hiseyes on the dark hall ahead and its sockets of blackness to each side.He could feel the woman trembling beneath his fingers. “Where are you hurt?” hewhispered. He pushed the hood of the robe back so that in the moonlight comingbetween the unfinished beams above she could see his face. “I’m Richard.”A smile of recognition overcame her. “Leg,” she said.She pulled her dress up. In faint light, he saw a dark wound just above theknee. With his sword, he sliced off the hem of her dress to use as a bandage toclose the wound.“I want to live. I wanted to help.” She took the strip of cloth and pushed hishands away. “Thank you for cutting me the cloth. I can do it, now.” She clutchedhis robe, pulling him closer. “You’ve showed us life with your statue. Thankyou.”Richard smiled as he squeezed her shoulder.“I was trying to get that cockroach. Will you do it?”Richard kissed his finger and pressed the kiss to her forehead. “I will. Bandageup your leg and lie still until we have the situation under control; then we’llsend people in to help.”Richard started moving again. From the distance came screams of rage, and pain.Guards who had escaped into the maze of the unfinished palace were battlingpeople who had gone in after them.Richard spotted a brother trembling behind a corner. It wasn’t Narev-there was ahood, not a cap. Playing the part of a brother, Richard pulled his hood up againand strode to the man. The brother looked relieved to see a comrade.“Who are you?” he whispered toward Richard, lifting his hand to use his magic tolight a small flame above his palm.“Justice,” Richard said to the wide eyes as he drove his sword through the man’sheart.Richard pulled his sword free and concealed it once more under his robes.Nicci would no doubt take her revenge. There seemed nothing he could do aboutit. Nicci had often enough made Richard’s choices clear. He was bound anddetermined to at least lay waste to the Order. If only there were a way to getNicci to see reason, to get her to help him. At times, the look in her blue eyesseemed so tantalizingly close to comprehension. He knew Nicci had feelings forhim. He wished he could use those feelings to get her to see reason, to helphim, to cast off her chains, but he didn’t know how.Richard stepped back into the blackness of a room as he heard guards running hisway. As they turned into the hallway, Richard again drew his sword. When theywere close, he burst out of the doorway and took off the first guard’s head. Thesecond swung his sword, missed, and lifted it for another strike. Richard ranhis sword through the man’s belly. The wounded guard pulled back, off the blade.Before Richard could finish him, more men burst into the hall. The man with thegut wound wasn’t going to be a problem anymore; it would take him hours of agonyto die.Richard retreated through the dark doorway, tempting men in after him. He stoodstill in the dark, and as they rushed in, panting, crunching debris beneath theballs of their feet as they turned, Richard located them by sound alone and cutthem down. Half a dozen men died in the pitch black room before the rest ran.Richard raced onward toward the sounds of explosions. Every time gouts of flameflashed through the morass of hallways, he hid his eyes with a hand in order topreserve his night vision. When the blinding flashes ceased, he quicklycontinued in the direction from which they had come.There were mile upon mile of halls in the palace. Some opened out into groundswhere nothing had yet been built. Others went along between walls open overhead.Still others tunneled through the darkness, enclosed by upper floors or roofs.Richard descended stairs into blackness, into the palace underground, followingthe roar of conjured flames.Down below the main floor were networks of interconnected rooms, made up of aconfusing snarl of chambers and narrow halls. As he plunged through a labyrinthof shadowy rooms, going through holes in unfinished walls and empty doorways, hecame suddenly upon a cloaked man with a sword. He knew none of the people werearmed.The man spun around, his sword leading, but since Richard was disguised inrobes, he knew the man might not be a true foe.In a flash of moonlight, Richard was stunned to see the Sword of Truth over theshoulder of the person. It was Kahlan.He froze in shock.She saw only a figure in brown robes-a brother-standing in a shaft of moonlight.The hood shadowed his face.In the same instant, before he could call her name, he saw, over Kahlan’sshoulder, someone running their way. Nicci.In one terrible blinding instant, Richard knew what he had to do. It was hisonly chance-Kahlan’s only chance-to be free.In that crystal clear instant of understanding, terror flashed through him. Hedidn’t know if he could do it.He had to.Richard drew his sword and blocked Kahlan’s thrust.And then he attacked her.He drove into her with controlled violence, careful not to hurt her. He knew howshe fought. He knew because he had taught her. He played the role of a clumsy,but lucky, opponent.Nicci was getting closer.Richard couldn’t drag it out. It had to be timed just right. He waited untilKahlan was slightly off balance and then with a powerful clash, caught her swordnear the cross guard. She cried out with the shock as her sword flew from herhand and the blow spun her around, just as he had intended.She didn’t hesitate for an instant. Without pause, still spinning, her handreached up and pulled free the Sword of Truth. The air rang with the uniquesound of steel he knew so well.Kahlan whirled around, the blade leading. He saw for a split second the terribleviolent rage in her eyes. It hurt him to see that in Kahlan’s beautiful eyes. Heknew what it did to a person.Richard entered a numb world all his own. He knew what he had to do. He felt noemotion. He blocked high, controlling her attack and where he wanted her to gowith the blade. He had to get her to put it where he intended, if there was tobe any chance.Teeth gritted, Kahlan drove her sword for the opening he deliberately left her.Kahlan was in the realm of uncontrollable rage. The instant she seized the hilt,the Sword of Truth had inundated her with pounding fury. Nothing in the worldfelt better than knowing she was going to kill with it. The weapon, too,demanded blood.These people had Richard. These brothers had twisted their lives. These men hadsent murderers to her homeland. These men had sent assassins to slaughterWarren.Now, she had one of them.She screamed as she spun, screamed with the rage, screamed with the demand forblood. It was glorious to have the object of such perfect rage within reach.He made a mistake-leaving an opening. Without hesitation, she went for it withcold fury, the blade leading.He was hers.Richard felt the blade hit him. It was shocking. It felt unlike what heexpected. It felt something like he imagined the mighty blow of the sledgehammeron the statue might feel.His mouth opened. Now was the time; he had to stop her-keep her from doing anymore. He had to do it now. If she wrenched the blade through him, ripped himopen any more, Nicci would never be able to heal him. Her power could only healso much.Nicci would have to free Kahlan from the spell in order to regain the use of hersorceress’s magic-in order to heal him.He reasoned that she cared enough for him to do that.Richard’s mouth was open as he felt the blade still driving through him. It wasa sickening shock. Even expecting it, as he had, it still seemed unreal. Itstill surprised him.He needed to tell her it was him. To stop.He needed at least to call out her name so she would stop without doing too muchdamage.His mouth was still open.He had no breath.He couldn’t make himself say her name.As she searched frantically for Richard, Nicci saw the two people battling. Onewas a brother. The other she didn’t recognize, yet there was something deeplyunsettling about it all. Nicci felt a strange stirring. The feeling was oddlyfamiliar, but in all the confusion of emotion, she just didn’t recognize it.They were a good distance away.The man in the cape lost his sword. It looked as if the brother had him. Nicciwanted to help-but how? She had to find Richard. Someone said they saw him gointo the palace. She had to find him.She ran toward the pair. The man pulled free another sword strapped over hisshoulder. The strange feeling welled up in Nicci. Something was terribly wrong,but she didn’t know what.And then she saw the brother make a mistake. Nicci halted.With a cry of lethal fury, the man in the cape drove his sword through thebrother.When the force of the blow drove the brother back a step, a shaft of moonlightfell across his face under in the cowl of the hood.And then the feeling slammed into her with full recognition.Nicci’s eyes went wide. She screamed.“Kahlan. Stop.”Kahlan’s eyes twitched up in shock. She saw his face in the moonlight. In thatsame instant, he heard Nicci scream.Kahlan recoiled, her hand flying from the hilt of the Sword of Truth as if shehad been struck by lightning.She fell back with a horrified shriek.Richard seized the blade of the sword, his sword, to keep the weight fromtwisting it in him. She had driven it through him almost up to the cross guard.Warm blood ran down the blade onto his fingers.“Richard!” Kahlan cried. “Nooo! Nooo!”Richard felt his knees hit the stone floor. He was surprised it didn’t hurt moreto have a sword through him. It was the shock of it, mostly, that had scrambledhis mind. It was hard to think. He struggled not to fall forward, fall on theblade and wrench it through his insides. The room seemed to be moving.“Pull it out,” he whispered.He wanted it out. As if that would help. He wanted the awful thing out. He couldfeel the razor sharp edges all the way through him. He could feel it stickingout his back.Kahlan, nearly hysterical, scrambled to do as he asked. Richard saw Cara limpingup out of the darkness. She seized his shoulders as Kahlan drew out the blade inone swift, panicked yank, as if she hoped the action would somehow undo what shehad done.“What happened?” Cara cried. “What did you do?”The world seemed to tip and whirl. Richard could feel the sickeningly wet warmthof his blood soaking down him. He could feel his weight against Cara. Kahlanhovered close.“Richard! Oh, dear spirits, no. This can’t be happening. It can’t.” Panickedtears streamed down her beautiful face. He couldn’t understand what she wasdoing here. Why was she in the Old World? What was she doing in the emperor’spalace?He couldn’t help smiling at seeing her.He wondered if she had seen his statue before he destroyed it.He wondered if he had made a terrible mistake.No, it was Kahlan’s only chance at freedom. His only chance to break Nicci’sspell.Nicci was still running toward them.“Help me, Nicci,” Richard called. It came out as little more than a whisper. “Ineed you to save me, Nicci. Please.”Even if it was no more than a whisper, Nicci heard his plea.--]----Nicci had never run so fast. Terror had her in its fierce grip. Kahlan hadstabbed her sword through him. It was a terrible mistake. It was all such aterrible mistake. Nicci had brought such pain to them both. It was her fault.Even in her shock, Nicci knew with clarity what she must do.She could heal him. Kahlan was there. Nicci couldn’t begin to imagine why, orhow, but she was. With Kahlan there, Nicci could break the spell. Once the spellwas broken, Nicci could use her gift. She could heal Richard. It was all right.She could save him. It would be all right. She could fix it. She could.She could do something right and help-really help-for once. She could help themboth.An arm swept out of the darkness and hooked her by the neck, taking her from herfeet. She cried out as she was yanked into the blackness. She could feel thebulge of hard muscles as she clawed at the arm. The man stank. She could feelhis lice ticking against her face as they sprang at her.Terror seized her. Such sudden and intense terror was an unfamiliar sensation,smothering her mind.She dug her heels into the stone as he drew her back into the black labyrinth.She kicked furiously at him. She tried to draw her dacra from her sleeve, but heseized her arm and twisted it behind her back.His forearm crushed against her exposed throat, choking off her air as he liftedher from her feet.Nicci couldn’t breathe. He chortled with glee as he dragged her into the darkerrecesses of the rooms beneath Jagang’s palace.Their eyes met just when she had been abruptly and violently snatched into thedarkness. Richard saw in those eyes something important, saw that Nicci intendedto help him. But she was gone.Cara desperately clutched his shoulders as he lay back against her. He was cold.She was warm.Kahlan fell back, writhing in the darkness. She clawed at her throat. He couldhear her choking.“Mother Confessor! Mother Confessor! What’s wrong?”Richard reached up and seized Cara behind her head. He pulled her face close.“Someone has Nicci. They’re choking her. Cara-you have to go save Nicci, orKahlan will die. And Nicci is the only one who can heal me. Go. Hurry.”He felt Cara nodding before he released her head.“I understand” was all she said as she gently, but swiftly, laid him back on thecold stone.And then she was gone.It was wet. He didn’t know if it was blood, or water. They were underground, inthe nether reaches of the Retreat. Through open beams where the flooring abovehadn’t been laid, moonlight flooded down to light Kahlan struggling not faraway. He could see, then, as she fought an invisible foe, that it was water.That’s what it was. Not blood. Water. The palace was next to the river. It waswet in the little rooms and halls down in the bottom.“Kahlan,” he murmured. She didn’t respond. “Hold on. . .”Gripping his abdomen, holding the wound closed lest his insides burst out, heinched his way through the water, across the cold stone. The pain had finallyand firmly arrived. He could feel the terrible damage inside. He tried to blinkaway the tears of hot agony. He had to hold on. Icy sweat drenched his face.Kahlan had to hold on.His hand, covered in blood, reached out to her. His fingers found hers. Shehardly responded, but at least her fingers moved. He was thankful beyond wordsthat her fingers moved.It had been a good plan. He was sure it was. It would have worked, if onlysomeone hadn’t snatched Nicci. Would have worked.It seemed a stupid way to die, really. He thought it should be somehow more . .. grand.Not in a dark, cold, wet palace underground.He wished he could tell Kahlan that he loved her, and that she hadn’t killed himbut that he had done it. It was his doing, not hers. He’d just used her in hisplan. It would have worked.“Kahlan,” he whispered, not knowing if in her stillness she could hear him anylonger. “I love you. No one else. Just you. I’m glad we had our time together. Iwouldn’t trade it for anything.”Richard opened his eyes and groaned in agony. He wanted it to end. It hurt toomuch. Now, he just wanted it to end. It hadn’t worked. He would have to pay theprice. But he wanted the sickening, ripping, terrifying pain to end.He didn’t know how much time had passed. He looked and saw Kahlan sprawled onthe wet floor. She wasn’t moving.A shadow fell across him.“Well, well. Richard Cypher.” Neal chuckled. “Imagine that.” He chuckled againas he glanced at Kahlan. “Who’s the woman?”Richard could sense the Sword of Truth, sense its magic. It wasn’t far from hisfingers.“Don’t know. She’s killed me. Must be one of yours.”Richard’s fingers found the sword. They curled around the wire-wound hilt.Neal stepped on the blade. “Can’t have any of that. You’ve caused enoughtrouble.”A glow ignited around Neal’s fingers. He was conjuring magic. Lethal magic.Richard, in his barely conscious condition, despite his need, could not focushis mind, could not call forth his own ability to do anything to stop Neal. Atleast, the pain would end. At least, Kahlan wouldn’t think it was she who hadkilled him.Richard heard a sudden, terrible, bone-snapping crack. Neal dropped heavily tohis knees.Richard, his hand already around the hilt, pulled the sword from underneath theman’s legs and in one mighty lunge, ran it through Neal’s heart.Neal looked up in surprise, his eyes glassy. Richard saw then that the man wasas good as dead before the blade had run him through. Neal’s eyes rolled back inhis head and he slumped to the side as Richard yanked the sword free.Standing behind Neal was the woman Richard had helped. She had bandaged her leg.In both hands, she held the marble hand of the woman Richard had carved. She hadcrushed Neal’s skull with her keepsake of the statue."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 69Richard heard footfalls splashing toward him down the wet hallway. The woman hadgone to find help. Maybe she had found it.In the rooms and hallways in the distance, Richard could hear occasional screamsas blasts of magic exploded through the night, as people were injured andkilled.A woman appeared in the moonlight. “Richard? Richard?”Richard squinted in the darkness. “Who are you?” he managed to whisper.She rushed to his side and fell to her knees. She gasped at seeing Kahlansprawled on the floor close to him.“What happened to the Mother Confessor?”Richard frowned. She knew Kahlan.“Who are you?”She looked back at him. “I’m a Sister. Sister Alessandra. I’ve been in the cityfor a while, looking for Nicci, and-never mind. A woman found me just down thehall-and said you were hurt. The man who carved the statue. I was tryingdesperately to get to you earlier, but I couldn’t get near-there I go again.Tell me where you’re hurt. I can try to heal you.”“I was run through with a sword.”She was still and silent for a moment.“Under my hands.”She looked then, and spoke a prayer under her breath. “I think I can help. Ifeared-”“I need Nicci to do it.”Sister Alessandra glanced about. “Nicci? Where is she, then? I’ve been searchingfor her. Ann sent me to find her.”Richard’s eyes fell on the still form of Kahlan. “Can you help her?”He could see the woman’s eyes look away from his. “No; I can’t. She’s linked bymagic to Nicci. I met her before, and she told me about it. I can do nothingthrough the shield of Nicci’s link.”“Is she . . . is she still.. .”The woman looked and then leaned back over him. “She’s alive, Richard.”He closed his eyes in relief, and in pain.“Lie still,” she said.“But I need Nicci to-”“You’re bleeding. This is bad, Richard. In a short time more, you will have losttoo much blood. If I wait, no one will be able to heal you. You will haveslipped too far beyond this world for any gift to help you. I can’t wait.“Besides, I came to try to stop Nicci. I know her better than anyone. You can’tput your life in her hands. You can’t put your faith in her.”“It’s not faith. I know-”“She’s a Sister of the Dark. I’m the one who led her down that dark road. I cameto try to lead her back. Until and unless that time comes, you can’t trust her.Now, you’ve not much time. Do you want to live, or not?”It had all gone for nothing. He felt a tear run from the corner of his eye andacross his cheek.“I choose life,” he said.“I know,” she whispered with a smile. “I saw the statue. Now, move your handsfor me. I need to have mine there.”Richard let his hands slip to his sides as hers covered his wound. He felthelpless. He could focus on nothing but the searing pain.He felt magic tingle into him, following the damage down deep inside him. Heclenched his teeth as he held in a cry.“Hold on,” she whispered. “This is bad. It will hurt, but then in a while itwill be all right.”“I understand,” he said. He gasped sharply. “Do it, then.”The pain of her magic seared into him like white-hot coals thrown on bare flesh.He almost cried out, but then the pain abruptly ceased. Richard lay with hiseyes closed, panting, waiting for it to start again. He felt her hands slip fromhim.Richard opened his eyes and saw that Sister Alessandra’s eyes were opened wide.For an instant, he wondered why.And then he saw a foot of steel jutting from her chest. Her fingers went to herthroat as blood gushed from her open mouth. A silent scream formed on her lips.A bony hand shoved her aside.She had been impaled on the sword Richard had used to fight Kahlan. His handblindly went for the hilt he knew was there, but a foot kicked the Sword ofTruth aside.Death’s own skull grinned down at him.“You are a troublesome man, Richard Cypher,” came the grating voice from thedarkness above. “But at last, that trouble is ended.”The tall angular figure in robes and a creased cap towered above him as he layhelpless on the cold wet floor.“This little rebellion of yours will be crushed, I can promise you that much,before you die. Their foolish little tantrum will be brought to an end. Thepeople will soon come to their senses. Your kind appeals only to the extremistfringe. Most people see their duty to their fellow man. Your efforts have beenfor nothing.”Brother Narev swept his arm around, as if in introduction.“An appropriate place for you to die, don’t you think, Richard? These rooms arethe future questioning chambers. You eluded the chambers once, but not thistime. You will die in one as you should have died in one before.“I, on the other hand, will live here a long, long time, and see the Order bringmorality to the world. Down here, in these chambers, radicals like you willconfess their wickedness. I just wanted you to know, before you are embraced inthe Keeper’s cold arms for all eternity.”Brother Narev’s skeletal hands clawed as he called forth his magic. Richard sawwhite-hot light blossom around the high priest’s hands and expand downward.Richard squeezed Kahlan’s hand as he watched the white light of death come forhim.The bloom of light turned a honey color. As if the air had thickened, the lightslumped off to the sides.A howl of fury grew in Narev’s throat. His shook his fists in rage.“You have the gift of a wizard! Who are you?”“I am your worst nightmare. I am a thinking man who can’t be deluded by yourlies, any more than I can be burned by your foul magic.”Brother Narev tried to smash his foot down on Richard’s face, but Richard wasable to deflect the blow. He seized Narev’s ankle. The man caught his balanceand pulled madly to get free. The effort of holding on felt as if it ripped thewound through Richard’s insides. He tried to hold on, but his fingers slippedfrom the wet leather.Once free, and out of Richard’s reach, Narev bent and seized the hilt of thesword lodged in the Sister’s back. He tugged but it didn’t come completely out.He growled in fury, his boots slipping on the slimy floor, as he yanked on thesword.Richard knew that, once armed, Narev would be a swift executioner.With all his strength, Richard lunged at the man’s legs. Brother Narev toppledback onto the wet floor. Richard, his middle wrenched in torture, threw himselfatop Narev’s legs to hold him down. Bony fingers clawed at Richard’s face,trying to gouge his eyes. Richard turned his head away. With fierce effort, heclutched at the heavy robes, dragging himself up the man’s body, ignoring theblows to his face as he did so.He seized Brother Narev by the throat. Brother Narev’s bony fingers closedsavagely around Richard’s throat. Both men growled with the effort of trying tostrangle each other to death. Richard twisted his head, trying to prevent Narevfrom getting a death grip, while at the same time trying to get his own thumbsover Narev’s windpipe so he could choke off his air.Narev tried to roll, to throw Richard off. Richard spread his legs to make itharder for Narev to flip him over, and held tight as the man twisted and fought.He could feel his insides tearing.Richard had wielded a chisel and hammer for the Order for months. He wasstronger, but he was also losing a lot of blood, and that strength was fading.He squeezed with all his might. The fingers at his throat loosened a little.The man’s eyes bulged as Richard finally managed to start to choke the life outof him. Bony hands thumped at Richard’s shoulders.The hands suddenly and fiercely seized Richard by his hair.Narev freed a leg and brought his knee up into Richard’s wound.The world went white with pain.Nicci woke, dazed, to the sound of a low, wicked laugh. She knew the voice. Sheknew the smell. Kadar Kardeef.She heard a snapping, popping, hissing sound. A torch, she realized. He whippedit around in front of her face, so close she could feel the terrible heatagainst her flesh. Burning pitch dripped off, falling on her leg.Nicci screamed in pain as the pitch burned into the flesh of her thigh.“What goes around, comes around,” Kadar said in her ear.“I don’t care what you do to me,” Nicci cried in rage. “I’m glad I burned you.I’m glad you’ve had to beg.”“Oh you’ll be begging, too, before long. You may not think so, but you’ll besurprised what fire makes a person do. You will yet know what it was like. Youwill yet beg.”With all her might, Nicci struggled against him. She could undo the spell, ifonly Kahlan were closer. So near, but so far.The fire before her eyes sent terror scorching through her. She had only to snipthe cord linking her to Kahlan. She could break the link. She didn’t have toundo it in order to have her power back. Nicci could escape, then. It would costKahlan her life, but Nicci would have her power, and she could escape theflames.But she would have to kill Kahlan to do it.“Shall I burn your face, first, Nicci? Your lovely face? Or maybe I should startwith your legs. Which shall it be? You pick.”Nicci panted as she struggled, trying to back away from the heat on her flesh.The hissing torch waved in front of her face. She knew she deserved such a fate;but she was driven to wild panic by the fear of it.She didn’t want to snip the link, to kill Kahlan, but she didn’t want to diethis way. She didn’t want her flesh to burn.“I say we start at the bottom, so we can hear your screams.”Kadar brought the torch down and touched it to the hem of her dress. Nicciscreamed as the black cloth caught flame. Such fear was a new sensation for her;for the first time since she was very small, she had something she cared about,and didn’t want to lose: life.In a moment of stark terror, Nicci knew that no matter how much it was to hurt,no matter how frightening it was to be, she would not take Kahlan’s life.Richard had given her the answer she had sought. She had taken too much already.In return for that lesson, she could not now violate it.Even though Kahlan, linked to Nicci, was to suffer the same fate, would die thesame agonizing death, Nicci would not be the one who inflicted it. She would nottake Kahlan’s life from her. Kadar would be bringing their death, but Nicciwould not. She would not kill Kahlan to save herself.Kadar Kardeef laughed as he watched her dress ignite. He held her in a firm gripNicci could not escape.Just then, a dark shape flew at her from midair, crashing into them both. Theytumbled back, the air all around filled with fire. As Nicci rolled, it put theflaming dress out in the water.The one who had crashed into them was just getting up, shaking her head as if toclear it. Nicci recognized her. It was the Mord-Sith, Cara.Kadar sat up, saw the woman, and lunged at her with the torch.Nicci threw herself at Kadar, grabbing the torch in both hands as she pushed itinto the big man’s face. The pitch splashed against his mask of rags. The clothon his chest and around his head ignited with a loud whoosh.Kadar screamed as the flames burned into his already melted flesh. Nicci hadheard that heat to previously burned flesh was worse than the first burning. Bythe sound of his screams, it appeared to be true.Nicci snatched Cara’s hand as the woman was regaining her feet. “Hurry! I mustget to Richard!”Outside the room where Kadar’s shrieks fell to strangled whimpers as the flamessuffocated him, Cara seized Nicci by the hair and held her Agiel inches from herface.“Give me one reason why I should trust you with Lord Rahl’s life.”Nicci gazed into Cara’s eyes. “Because I saw his statue, and I understand, now,how wrong I’ve been. Have you ever been wrong, Cara? Really wrong? Can you everunderstand what it’s like to realize you’ve been unthinkingly serving evil, andhurting good people? Can you understand that Richard has shown me there issomething to live for?”Nicci found Richard lying on his back, unconscious, or at least close to it. Hishead was pillowed on a marble hand. Kahlan lay beside him, clinging to him,weeping as his life bled away.Nicci was shocked to see the bodies strewn on the floor around them. SisterAlessandra, Brother Neal, Brother Narev. She knew by the way Richard looked thatthere was precious little time-if it was not already too late.Nicci knelt beside Kahlan. The woman was in abject misery, hanging by the lastthreads of desperate hope over the black brink of despair. She had come all thisway, wanting to be with him, willing to suffer any end to do so. And here helay, the lifeblood draining out of the one she loved most in life, knowing itwas by her hand.Nicci took Kahlan by her shoulders and gently pulled her back. Kahlan looked upin confusion, hatred, and hope.“Kahlan, I need to remove the spell from you if I’m to help him. There’s notmuch time.”“I don’t trust you. Why would you help?”“Because I owe it to him-to both of you.”“You have brought nothing but suffering and-”Cara took Kahlan’s arm. “Mother Confessor, you don’t have to trust her. Trustme. I’m telling you that Nicci might be able to save him. I believe she will doher best. Please, let her do it.”“Why should I trust her with his last few minutes of his life?”“Please, let Nicci have the chance Lord Rahl once gave me.”Kahlan searched Cara’s eyes for a moment, then turned to Nicci.“I know what it’s like to be where he is now. I’ve been there. I chose life.Now, he must. What do I need to do?”“You and Richard have already done enough.” Nicci took Kahlan’s tearstained facein her hands. “Just be still, and let me do this.”The woman was shivering in misery. Her long hair was matted and dripping wet.She was covered in Richard’s blood. She could do no more for him, and she knewit.Nicci had to.As Kahlan gazed into her eyes, Nicci re-ignited the connecting cord of magic,hoping that she had enough time.Kahlan went rigid with the shock of pain it caused. Nicci knew exactly how itfelt, because she felt the same pain.Milky light connected both women, heart to heart. Its wavering glow grew toblinding brightness, taking the pain to a new level in intensity.Kahlan’s mouth opened in a silent cry. Her green eyes widened with the tormentflooding through them both-as the root of magic embedded in every fiber of theirtwo beings vibrated in response to the call of the light.Nicci placed her hands over her heart, in that incandescent shaft of light, andbegan to withdraw her power."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 70Richard pulled a shuddering breath as he opened his eyes. Somehow, he was lyingin a position that didn’t hurt. He feared to move, lest the crushing painreturn.How could that be? He’d been run through with a sword.The darkness around him was still and quiet. In the distance, he could hear thesounds of battle raging on. The ground beneath him shuddered with some greatimpact.There were people around him. Bodies lay on the wet floor. He realized he was ona board, keeping him up out of the water. He was covered in a warm cloak. Hecould see the dark hunched shapes of people huddled around in the little room.Under his fingers lay the hilt of the Sword of Truth. Because the storm of magicwas calmed, he knew the sword was in its scabbard.He looked up, and through the openings between beams, through broken stone andsplintered wood, and could see the rosy blush of dawn.“Kahlan?” he whispered.Three figures in the room sprang up, as if stone had suddenly come to life.The closest leaned in. “I’m here.” She took up his hand.With his other hand, he reluctantly probed for his wound. He couldn’t find it.He felt no pain, only a lingering ache.Another figure leaned in. “Lord Rahl? Are you awake?”“What happened?”“Oh, Richard, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I stabbed you. It was all my fault. Ishould have taken an instant to be sure before I did it. I’m so sorry.”Richard frowned. “Kahlan, I let you win.”Silence greeted him.“Richard,” Kahlan finally said, “you don’t have to try to ease my guilt. I knowit’s my fault. I ran you through with the sword.”“No,” Richard insisted, “I let you win.”Cara patted his shoulder. “Of course you did, Lord Rahl. Of course you did.”“No, really.”When the third figure turned to him, Richard’s fingers tightened around the hiltof his sword.“How do you feel?” Nicci asked in that silken voice he knew so well.“Did you remove the link to Kahlan?”Nicci raised her hand and made a scissors motion with two fingers. “Gone forgood.”Richard let out a breath. “Then I feel fine.” He tried to sit up, but Nicci’shand restrained him.“Richard, I can never ask your forgiveness because I can never return what Istole from you, but I want you to know that I now understand how wrong I’vebeen. My whole life, I have been blind. I’m not making an excuse. It’s just thatI want you to know that you have restored my vision. In giving me the answer Isought, you gave me my life. You gave me a reason to want to live.”“And what did you see, Nicci?”“Life. You sculpted it so big that even someone who had so blindly served evil,as I had done, could see it. You must no longer prove yourself to me. Now, it isfor me, and those here you have inspired, to prove ourselves to you.”“You and they have already begun, or I would not be alive.”“So . . . you are a Sister of the Light again?” Kahlan asked.Nicci shook her head. “No. I am Nicci. My ability as a sorceress is mine; it iswho I am. My ability does not enslave me to others because they want it. It’s mylife. It does not belong to anyone---except maybe to you two.”“You both have shown me the value of life, the rationale of freedom. If I am toserve beside anyone, now, it will be beside others who hold dear the samevalues.”Richard placed his hand over Nicci’s. “Thank you for saving my life. For a whilethere, I thought I’d made a mistake when I let Kahlan run me through.”“Richard,” Kahlan objected, “you don’t have to try to assuage my guilt by sayingthat.”Nicci was gazing into his eyes, even as she addressed Kahlan. “He’s not. He’stelling you the truth. I saw him do it. He was forcing me to make a choice tosave him, so that I would have to break the spell holding you. I’m sorry you hadto endure such a thing, Richard; I’d already made the choice-the moment I sawyour statue.”Richard tried to sit up again. Nicci restrained him again.“It is going to take time for you to recover fully. You are still suffering thelingering effects of the injury. Just because you are alive, that doesn’t meanit won’t take some time before you are completely recovered. You have gonethrough a formidable ordeal. You lost a lot of blood. You will need to rebuildyour strength. You could yet die if you don’t go easy.”“All right,” Richard conceded. He sat up carefully with Kahlan’s help. “I’llkeep your words in mind, but I still have to get up there.” He turned to Kahlan.“By the way, what are you doing all the way down here? How did you know where Iwas? What’s happening to the north, in the New World?”“We’ll talk about all that later,” she said. “I had to be with you. I decidedthat it was my life, and I wanted to be with you. You were right about the warin the New World. It took me a long time to come to understand that. I finallydid. I came to be with you because that was all that was left for me.”He looked to Cara. “And you?”“I always wanted to see the world.”Richard smirked as he rose with the help of Kahlan and Cara, both. He feltlightheaded, but was joyful to trade that for the way he had been before. Kahlanhanded him his sword. He slipped the baldric over his head, laying the leatheracross his shoulder and the scabbard at his hip. Knowing the weapon a littlemore intimately, now, he had a new respect for it.“I can’t tell you how happy I am to return it to you,” Kahlan said. She smiledsheepishly. “Like this, I mean.”Farther down the hall Kamil was anxiously waiting in the darkness pierced byonly a couple of candles. There were a number of people with him. Richard didn’tknow any of the people, except Kamil. He put a hand to the grinning young man’sshoulder.“Kamil. Good to see you.”“Richard, I saw it. I saw the statue.” His smile faded. “I’m sorry it wasdestroyed.”“It was only a piece of stone. It was the ideas it represented that were itstrue beauty.”People in the dim hallway nodded. Richard saw, then, the woman with the woundedleg. He smiled at her. She returned a kiss, on the end of her fingers, to hisforehead.“Bless you for your bravery in carving that statue,” she said. “We are alljoyful to know you survived the night, Richard.”He thanked them all for their concern.The ground shook-again.“What is that?” Richard asked.“The walls,” one of the men said. “The people are pulling down the walls withthose carvings of death on them.”Even as some people were pulling down the walls, others were still engaged inpitched battle. Richard could see in the faint light of dawn the fighting on thedistant hillsides. It appeared that many people were not happy about the ideasRichard’s statue had represented. There were those who feared freedom, andpreferred the numb existence of not having to think for themselves.The palace grounds, though, were in secure hands. The fires of liberty werespreading outward, igniting a conflagration of change.In the plaza, the semicircle of walls and all the columns but one still stood.It felt somehow different here. This was the place where people had seen thestatue and had chosen life. They weren’t destroying this part of the palace.Richard dragged his boot through the marble dust. In the center of the plaza,the layer of white dust was all that remained. Every precious fragment had beensaved as a reminder.From out on the grounds where several men were gathered, Victor spotted Richard,Kamil, and Nicci, whom he knew. He called out as he and Ishaq came running.“Richard!” Victor raced up the steps. “Richard!”Richard had Cara under one arm and Kamil under the other, supporting him. Hedidn’t have the strength to shout, so he simply waited until the two men wereclose, both panting from their run.“Richard, we’re winning!” Victor said as he pointed at the hills. “All thoseofficials, gone, and we-”The blacksmith went silent as his eyes fell on Kahlan. Ishaq, too, stared ather, then swept his red hat off his head.Victor’s mouth labored a moment before words finally worked their way out. Hishand, usually so expressive, simply pointed at her as if she could not be realflesh.“You. . .” he said to Kahlan. “You are Richard’s love.”Kahlan smiled. “How do you know that?”“I saw the statue.”In the dawn light, Richard could see her face go red.“It didn’t look exactly like me,” she protested, graciously.“Not the way it looked, but the . . . character. You have that quality.”Kahlan smiled, pleased by his words.“Victor, Ishaq, this is Kahlan. My wife.”Both men blinked dumbly and looked as one to Nicci.“As you know,” Nicci said, “I am not a very good person. I am a sorceress. Iused my power to force Richard to come here with me. Richard has shown me, alongwith many other people, the nobility of life.”“Then you’re the one who saved his life?” Victor asked.“Kamil told us you were hurt, Richard,” Ishaq said, “and that a sorceress washealing you.”“Nicci healed me,” Richard confirmed.Victor gestured expansively-at last. “Well, I guess that has to count forsomething, saving Richard Cypher.”“Richard Rahl,” Richard said.Victor’s rolling laugh rumbled up from deep inside. “Right. This day, we are allRichard Rahl.”Nicci leaned in. “It really is Richard Rahl, Mr. Cascella.”“Richard Rahl,” Kahlan said, adding her nod.“Lord Rahl,” Cara said in ill humor. “Show the proper respect to the Seeker ofTruth, the master of the D’Haran Empire, war wizard, and the husband to theMother Confessor herself.” Cara lifted her hand in graceful, regal introduction.“Lord Rahl.”Richard shrugged. He lifted the gleaming, silver-wound hilt of his sword,showing them the word TRUTH in gold, and then let it drop back into itsscabbard.“What a beauty!” Kamil shouted.Victor and Ishaq both blinked again, and then dropped to a knee. They bowedtheir heads deeply.Richard rolled his eyes. “Will you two stop it.” He shot Cara a scowl.Victor peered up cautiously. “But we never knew. I’m sorry. You’re not angry Imade fun of you?”“Victor, it’s me, Richard. How many times have we eaten your lardo together?”“Lardo?” Kahlan asked. “You know how to make lardo, Victor?”Victor rose up, a grin growing across his face as he peered at her. “You know oflardo?”“Of course. The men who used to come to work on the white marble at theConfessors’ Palace used to eat lardo they made themselves -in big marble tubs. Iused to sit and eat it with them when I was little. They used to say I wouldgrow up to wear the white dress of the Mother Confessor one day because I atetheir lardo and would grow strong from it.”Victor thumped his chest with a big thumb. “I make lardo in marble tubs, too.”“Do you let it age for a year?” Kahlan asked. “You have to let proper lardo agefor a year.”“Of course, a year! I make only proper lardo.”Kahlan gave him her most beautiful, green-eyed smile. “I would love to taste itsometime.”Victor draped his massive arm around Kahlan’s shoulders. “Come, Richard’s wife,I will give you a taste of my lardo.”Cara, a dark look on her face, put a hand to the blacksmith’s chest to stop him.She lifted his arm from Kahlan’s shoulders.“No one but Lord Rahl touches the Mother Confessor.”Victor gave Cara a quizzical look. “Have you ever had lardo?”“No.”Victor slapped Cara on the back as he laughed. “Come, then, and I will give youlardo, too. Then you will see-anyone who eats lardo with me is my friend forlife.”Kahlan took Kamil’s place under one of Richard’s arms, Victor under the other,and they made their way across newly free ground up to the blacksmith’s shop, tohave some lardo."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 71Verna pulled the candle close. She warmed her hands over it a moment, then laidthe journey book on the table. The sounds of the army camp outside her smalltent were by now so familiar she almost didn’t hear them.It was a cold D’Haran winter night, but at least they and all the people theyhad helped were safely over the mountains. Verna understood their quiet anxiety:it was a new and mysterious place, D’Hara, a land once only a source ofnightmares. At least they were safe for the time being. In the distance thewolves’ long plaintive howls echoed through the frigid mountains, off themoonlit snow blanketing the seemingly endless, desolate, colossal slopes.It was the proper phase of the moon, even if it was the moon in a new land, astrange and unknown land. Verna had checked for months, but there was never amessage. She didn’t really expect one, since Kahlan had thrown Ann’s twinnedjourney book in the fire. But still, it was a journey book, an ancient thing ofmagic, and Ann was a resourceful woman. It didn’t hurt to look.Verna opened the little book with no real hope.There, on the first page, was a message.All it said, was, Verna, I am waiting, if you are there.Verna drew the stylus from the spine and immediately began writing. Prelate! Youhave been able to fix the damaged journey book? That’s wonderful. Where are you?Are you well? Have you found Nathan?Verna waited. Shortly, the reply began to appear.Verna, I am well. I was able to restore the journey book with the help of some.. . people. Strange people. But the important part is that it is restored forthe most part. I am still searching for the prophet. I have some good clues onNathan’s whereabouts, and I am looking into them. But how are you, Verna? Howgoes the war? Warren? Kahlan? Is Zedd giving you much trouble? That man can trythe patience of stone. Have you had word of Richard?Verna stared at words on the page. A tear fell near Warren’s name. She picked upthe stylus once more, and slowly began her reply.Oh, Prelate, some terrible things have happened.I am sorry, Verna, came the reply. Verna, I am here. I am going nowhere for thenight. Take all the time you need. Tell me what happened. Tell me how you are,first. I worry so for you. Verna, I love you like a daughter. You know I do.Verna nodded to the book. She did know it.And I love you, too, Prelate, Verna began. I fear my heart is broken.Kahlan stood silently beside him in the warm midday breeze as Richard looked outover the river, at the city beyond. The city was peaceful, now. Battle had ragedfor weeks, various factions struggling for power, lusting to be the new localincarnation of the Order, each faction swearing that they had the best interestof the people at heart, each promising that they would be compassionate in theirrule, each pledging that life would be easier under their mandate because theywould see to it that everyone of means contributed to the common good.After decades of such altruistic tyranny, decay and death had been the onlyproduct of the business of the common good. Despite graveyards full of evidenceand a people left impoverished, these aspirants to power offered only more ofthe same, and yet many still believed them simply because they uttered such goodintentions.While a great number of brothers and officials had been killed, some hadescaped. Some of those, who had not fled, thought to take advantage of theconfusion and establish control, thinking they could rein in the hunger forfreedom, the ideas loosed, and put things back to the way they were.The free people of Altur’Rang, their numbers growing daily, eradicated each ofthese factions as they emerged from under their rocks. Nicci had been no smallaid in the bloody battles. She knew the methods of such people, where they wentto ground, and pounced on them like a wolf on vermin.The forces lusting to oversee the welfare and betterment of mankind came togreatly fear that which they had in fact created: Death’s Mistress.There was no telling, yet, if freedom’s flame, now ignited, would spread throughthe Old World. It was still a very small flame in a vast and dark place, butRichard knew that such a flame burned brightly.To the north, matters were not nearly so auspicious. With Nicci’s magicwithdrawn, Richard supposed that the D’Harans would know where he was, and sendhim messages. Cara was immensely relieved to be able to sense his location againthrough her bond.He had listened quietly as Kahlan and Cara had told him all the details of thewar, and how they had sent the people of Aydindril on a long and difficultjourney to D’Hara before Jagang could march into the city in the spring. Itwould give them heart to know that Lord Rahl had struck a mighty blow againstthe Old World, to know that the Mother Confessor was with him, and that theywere well. A number of men had requested the job of carrying that invaluablenews north.Soon, the D’Haran Empire and the people they were protecting who had fled theirhomes would know of the victory to the south. The messengers would actually becarrying a more precious commodity than that news: they would in reality becarrying hope.Richard had also sent his grandfather the same word.Richard could hardly believe that Warren, his friend, was gone. The terribleanguish, he knew, would be slow to fade.Richard had sent one other thing north.Nicci had told him of Brother Narev’s importance to Emperor Jagang, of theirlong history together, and of their shared vision of the future of mankind. Inthe spring when Jagang finally, triumphantly, rode in to seize the Confessors’Palace, waiting for him there, before his empty victory, would be his mentor’shead on a pike, topped by his creased brown cap.Nicci had woven a spell around it, to preserve it, to keep scavengers away. Richand wanted to be sure that when Jagang finally saw it, he would not mistake whoit was.In the teeming city of Altur’Rang, peace had returned, along with freedom. Lifehad returned. People had begun to open new businesses. In a matter of weeks,there was already a variety of bread available. New enterprises were startingevery day. Ishaq was making a fortune hauling goods, but already had competitorsvying for the business. Nabbi had gone to work for him. Ishaq had begged Richardto come work for him when he was strong enough. Richard had only laughed.Faval, the charcoal maker, had beseeched Ishaq to ask Richard to come to visitand have dinner with him and his family. Faval had bought a cart, and his sonsnow delivered charcoal.Richard leaned with his forearms on the railing at the edge of the pier andgazed down over the edge, to the swirling water below, as if trying to divinewhat the future held.The piers out into the river and the walkway atop them, along with the plaza,were about all that remained of the palace. Richard had seen to it that thespellforms were removed from the tops of the columns around the grounds, and hadPriska melt them down.Richard had regained most of his strength. Kahlan was strong, and as beautifulas he remembered her. She had changed, though. Her face had grown more mature inthe year they had been apart. When he gazed at her, he hungered for a piece ofmarble and his chisels so he could carve her face in stone.Flesh in stone.He turned and looked back along the pier, toward the plaza, with its semicircleof columns behind it. The fallen column had been restored. The plaza had beenrenamed “Liberty Square,” Victor’s idea. Richard asked if it shouldn’t be called“Liberty Circle,” since it was round, and not square. Victor thought it soundedbetter as Liberty Square, so Richard called it Liberty Square. After all, thefirst man to declare himself free, there, had been Victor.Kahlan gazed with him back toward the plaza.“What do you think?” Richard asked her.She shook her head, looking at best a little uneasy. “I don’t know, Richard. Itjust seems so strange to see it so . . . big. So . . . white.”“You don’t like it?”She quickly put a hand on his arm to dispel the notion. “No, it isn’t that, it’sjust that it’s so. . .” her uncertain gaze returned down the pier-”big.”The center of the plaza, where the statue Richard had carved had briefly stood,now held a towering marble statue being worked on by a number of stone carverswho used to work at the site carving misery and death. Kamil was down there,learning the craft of stone carving from masters. His education started with abroom.Richard had hired the carvers. With the fortune he had made helping the Orderbuild its palace, he could easily afford it. The carvers were glad for suchwork-to exchange value for value.The expert carvers were working on scaling up the small statue of Spirit, whichRichard had carved for Kahlan, way back in their mountain home when she neededto witness vitality, courage, and indomitable spirit. It emerged anew in thebest white Cavatura marble.The bronze ring of the sundial had survived intact, and was being added to thepiece. The statue rising in the center would cast its shadow on the curved dialplane. The words so many had touched that day would be there for all to see,now.Kahlan had been enthusiastic about the concept, but had spent so many monthswith the carving Richard had done, that it was disorienting for her to see it onsuch a massive scale. She was eager for the day when the carvers were finishedscaling it up and she could have her own statue of Spirit back.“I hope you don’t mind sharing it with the world,” he said.Kahlan smiled wistfully. “No, not at all.”“Everyone loves it,” he assured her.Her wonderful lilting laugh drifted out across the warm afternoon air. “I’lljust have to get used to you showing people my body and soul.”Together, they watched as the carvers working on the flowing robes checked theirwork with calipers against the statue Richard had carved and the referencepoints from wooden braces used to scale up the work.Kahlan rubbed his lower back. “How are you feeling?”“I’m fine. Now that you’re with me, I couldn’t feel better.”Kahlan laughed, then. “As long as I don’t run you through?”Richard’s laugh fell in easily with hers. “You know, when we tell our childrenhow their mother ran their father through with a sword, it’s going to lookpretty bad for you.”“Are we going to have children, Richard?”“Yes, we are.”“Then I’ll risk the tale.”As the warm breeze ruffled her hair, he kissed her brow.Glancing along the line of trees, their leaves shimmering in the sunlight,Richard watched birds cavort above the riverbank, sweep into a group, and thensoar together up over the semicircle of white marble columns standing in theexpanse of green grass.Kahlan leaned contentedly against his shoulder as they watched men, filled withpride, smiling while they worked on the statue standing before those columns.In Altur’ Rang, there was a new spirit.In the former heart of the Order beat freedom."},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsChapter 1
