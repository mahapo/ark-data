In the thick forest, she could not avoid all the bones underfootor the clawlike branches that dangled near her head. The way would have beentreacherous even in full daylight, but in the deep night of the Dark Lands, thetrail was nearly impossible.Nicci never bothered to acknowledge the impossible, though, when she had a taskto complete.Piles of moss-covered human remains cluttered the shadowy forest. Yellowingbones stood out in the gloom, illuminated by moonlight that seeped through theleafy vine-strangled boughs overhead. When she climbed over a rotted oak trunkthat had collapsed across the path, her heel crushed the old shell of anotherskull, scattering ivory teeth from a gaping jaw—as if these long-dead victimswanted to bite her, like the cannibalistic half people who had recently swarmedout of the Dark Lands.Nicci had no fear of skulls. They were just empty remnants, and she had createdplenty of skeletons herself. She paused to inspect a mound of bones stackedagainst a lichen-covered oak. A warning? A signpost? Or just a decoration?The witch woman Red had an odd sense of humor. Nicci couldn’t understand whyNathan was so insistent on seeing her, and he refused to reveal his intentions.Crashing through tangled willows ahead, Nathan Rahl called back to her. “There’sa big meadow up here, Sorceress. We’ll make better time across the clearing.”Nicci did not hurry to catch up to the wizard. Nathan’s impatience often led himto make rash decisions. She pointed out coolly, “We would make better time if wedidn’t travel through the thickest forest in the dark of night.” Her long blondhair fell past her shoulders, and she felt perspiration on her neck, despite thecool night air. She brushed a few stray pine needles and the ragged lace of atorn spiderweb from her black travel dress.Pausing at the edge of the wide meadow, the wizard raised an eyebrow. His longwhite hair seemed too bright in the shadows. “Judging by all the skeletons, wemust be close to our destination. I am eager to get there. Aren’t you?”“This is your destination, not mine,” she said. “I accompany you by choice—forRichard.” The two had trudged through the trackless forest for days.“Indeed? I thought you were supposed to watch over me.”“Yes, I’m sure that’s what you thought. Perhaps I just wanted to keep you out oftrouble.”He arched his eyebrows. “I suppose you’ve succeeded so far.”“That remains to be seen. We haven’t found the witch woman yet.”Nathan Rahl, wizard and prophet, had a lean and muscular frame, azure eyes, andhandsome features. Although the two men were separated by many generations,Nathan’s face, strong features, and hawklike glare still reminded Nicci ofRichard Rahl—Lord Rahl, leader of the much-expanded D’Haran Empire, and nowleader of the known world.Under an open vest, Nathan’s ruffled white shirt was much too frilly to serve asa rugged travel garment, but he didn’t seem to mind. He swirled a dark blue capeover his shoulders. The wizard wore tight but supple black pants and stylishleather boots with a flared top flap and dyed red laces for a flash of color.As Nicci joined him, he put a hand on the pommel of the ornate sword at his hipand gazed across the starlit clearing. “Yes, traveling through the night istedious, but at least we keep covering distance. I spent so many centuries inone place, locked in the Palace of the Prophets. Indulge me for being a littlerestless.”“I will indulge you, Wizard.” She had agreed to take him to the witch woman, butafter that she had not decided how best she would serve Richard and the D’HaranEmpire. “For now.” Nicci was also restless, but she was a woman who liked tohave a clear, firm goal.He smiled at her brusque tone. “And they say prophecy is gone from the world!Richard predicted you might find my company frustrating as we traveledtogether.”“I believe he used the word ‘obnoxious.’”“I’m quite sure he didn’t say it aloud.” They crossed the dew-scattered meadow,following a faint trail that led to the trees on the other side. “Nevertheless,I am pleased to have such a powerful sorceress protecting me. It befits myposition as the roving ambassador for D’Hara. With my skills as a wizard and aprophet, we’ll be nearly invincible.”“You are no longer a prophet,” Nicci reminded him. “No one is.”“Just because a man loses his fishing pole doesn’t mean he ceases to be afisherman. And if my gift of prophecy is taken away, I will still muddle along.I can draw upon my vast experience.”“Then perhaps I should let you find the witch woman yourself.”“No, for that I need your help. You’ve met Red before.” He gestured ahead. “Ithink she likes you.”“I’ve met Red, yes, and I survived.” Nicci paused to regard a knee-high pyramidof rounded skulls, a sharp contrast to the peaceful starlit meadow. “But I amthe exception, not the rule. The witch woman likes no one.”Nathan was not deterred, nor had she expected him to be. “Then I will work mycharms. So long as you help me find her.”Stopping under the open sky, Nicci looked up into the great expanse of night,and what she saw there frightened her more than any moldering skeletons. Thepanoply of stars, twinkling lights strewn across the void, were all wrong. Thefamiliar constellations she had known for nearly two centuries were nowrearranged with the star shift Richard had caused.When Nicci was a little girl, her father had taken her out into the night andused his outstretched finger to draw pictures across the sky, telling stories ofthe imaginary characters up there. Only two weeks ago, those eternal patternshad changed; the universe had changed, in a dramatic reconfiguring of magic. Andwhen Lord Rahl realigned the stars, prophecy itself was ripped from the world ofthe living and sent back through the veil to the underworld. That cataclysm hadchanged the universe in unknown ways, with consequences yet to be seen orunderstood.Nicci was still a sorceress, and Nathan remained a wizard, but all theintricately bound lines of his gift of prophecy had unraveled within him. Anentire part of his being had now been simply stripped away.Rather than worrying about the loss of his ability, though, Nathan seemed oddlyenthusiastic about this unexpected new opportunity. He had always consideredprophecy to be bothersome. Imprisoned in the Palace of the Prophets for athousand years, considered a danger to the world, he had been denied theopportunity to lead his own life. Now with prophecy gone and the undead EmperorSulachan sent back to the underworld, Nathan felt more free than ever before.He was delighted when Richard Rahl sent him off as a roving ambassador for thenewly expanded D’Haran Empire, to see if he could help the people in the DarkLands—a thinly disguised pretext for Nathan to go wherever he liked while stillostensibly achieving something useful. The wizard had been eager to see landsunknown. (And the way Nathan said the words made it sound like the name of anactual country, “Lands Unknown.”)Knowing his intent, Nicci couldn’t possibly let the wizard go off alone. Thatwould have been dangerous to Nathan and possibly dangerous to the world. Whilethe battered D’Haran army returned from the bloody battles, and the dead werestill being tallied and mourned, Nicci had accepted an important mission of herown. A mission for Richard.Everyone from Westland to the Midlands, from D’Hara to the Dark Lands, and evenfar south into the Old World, needed to know that Lord Rahl was the new ruler ofa free world. Richard had decreed that he would no longer tolerate tyranny,slavery, or injustice. Each land would remain independent, so long as the peoplefollowed a set of commonly agreed-upon rules and behaviors.But much of the world didn’t even know they had been liberated, and there wouldsurely be petty warlords or tyrants who refused to accept the new tenets offreedom. Richard needed to know the extent of his empire, so much of whichremained unexplored, and that was a service Nicci could provide, gatheringinformation as she traveled with Nathan.Nicci believed in her mission wholeheartedly. This was the dawn of a golden age.In the Old World, what remained of the Imperial Order in the aftermath ofEmperor Jagang and his predecessors was now a mixed bag of local leaders, someof them fair-minded and enlightened, others abusive and selfish. If any localleader caused trouble, Nicci would deal with the problem. Though she knewRichard would back her up with his full military might, she did not intend tobother the whole D’Haran army, unless it became absolutely necessary.Nicci would make certain that it did not become necessary.On a more personal level, although she loved Richard with a depth she had neverfelt for anyone else, Nicci knew that he belonged with Kahlan, and she wouldalways feel out of place close to them. She didn’t belong there.By going off with Nathan to Lands Unknown, she could serve Richard, but alsohave a new freedom. She could have her own life.* * *“I’ve heard what the witch woman can do.” Nathan strode along with far too muchcheer in the brightening morning. He tossed his blue cape over his shoulder witha flourish. “I need to ask something of her, and I have no reason to believe shewon’t grant it. We’re practically colleagues, in a certain sense.”They maneuvered through a dense grove of spindly birch saplings, pushing asidethe white-barked trees as they followed the mounds of crumbling bones. Nathansniffed the air. “Are you certain this is the way?”“Red will be found if she wants to be found.” Nicci glanced down at the staringempty eye sockets filled with moss. “Many people regret finding her.”“Ah, yes—be careful what you wish for.” He chuckled. “That should have beenanother one of the Wizard’s Rules.”“Up on her mountain pass, Red left the ground strewn with thousands andthousands of bones and skulls from a great army of the half people sheslaughtered single-handedly.” Nicci looked from side to side. “But some of theseremnants are much older. She has been killing for a long time, and for her ownreasons.”Nathan was undeterred. “I shall endeavor not to give her a reason to kill us.”The granite boulders around them grew more prominent, shaded under lush maplesand domineering oaks. A tingle crept along the back of her neck, and Niccilooked up to see a muscular catlike thing regarding them from the top of alarge, rounded outcropping. The strange creature had green eyes and darklyspotted fur. Seeing them, it let out a sound that was partly purr, partly growl.Nathan leaned against a birch, unafraid. “Now, what is that animal? I’ve neverseen a species like that before.”“You lived most of your life locked in a tower, Wizard. The world has manyspecies you haven’t seen.”“But I had plenty of time to peruse books of natural history.”Nicci had recognized the animal at first glance. “The Mother Confessor named himHunter. He is Red’s companion.” The catlike thing’s pointed ears pricked up.Nathan brightened. “That must mean we are close.”Without seeming to hurry, Hunter jumped down from the boulder and trotted offthrough the birches, guiding Nicci and Nathan along. “He has led me to the witchwoman before,” Nicci said. “We should follow.”“And of course we shall,” Nathan said.They moved at a fast pace, following the creature through the slatted birchforest and tangled underbrush. Hunter paused every so often to glance over hisshoulder, making sure they were still there.Finally, Nicci and Nathan emerged above a serene, hidden hollow. Theoutstretched boughs of a gigantic lichen-covered oak spread over the entire glenlike an enormous roof. The bitter smell of smoke rose from an ill-tended cookfire that burned in a ring of stones not far from a fieldstone cottageconstructed against the side of the opposite slope.As if waiting for them, a thin woman sat primly on a stone bench in front of thecottage, watching them with piercing sky-blue eyes. She wore a clinging graydress, and her hair was a mass of tangled red locks. Black-painted lips made hersmile ominous instead of welcoming. The crow perched on her shoulder looked morecurious about the visitors than the witch woman did.Knowing full well how dangerous Red could be, Nicci met the other woman’s gazewithout speaking. Even though he had seen the countless skulls, Nathan ignoredthe danger and strode forward with a hand raised in greeting. “You must be thewitch woman. I am Nathan Rahl—Nathan the prophet.”“Wizard, not prophet,” Red corrected. “Everything is changed now.” Her blacklips smiled again, without warmth. “You are Nathan Rahl, ancestor of RichardRahl. I have been called a seer and an oracle, but I have had enough visions tolast me for quite some time. I foresaw that you would come to me.”The spotted catlike creature sat beside her, blinking his green eyes as he facedthe visitors. Still seated on her stone bench, Red fastened her gaze on Nicci.“And Nicci the Sorceress. I’m pleased to see you again.”“You have never been pleased to see me,” Nicci said. Part of her wanted tosummon her magic, release a flow of destruction, both Additive and SubtractiveMagic, anything that might be necessary to blast the witch woman into ashes. “Infact, you commanded the Mother Confessor to kill me.”Red laughed. “Because I foresaw that you would kill Richard.” She must have seenthe dark edge of Nicci’s anger, but she showed no glimmer of fear. “Surely youcan understand. I had only the best of intentions. It was nothing personal.”“And I did kill Richard, just as you predicted,” Nicci said, recalling how thatdecision had nearly torn her apart. “Stopped his heart so he could travel to theunderworld and save Kahlan.”“See? So it all worked out for the best, then. And I did help you to bring himback.” The crow on Red’s shoulder bobbed forward, as if nodding. The witch womanhardened her gaze. “Now, why have you come here?”Nathan stood straight and tall. “We’ve been searching for days. I have a requestto make.”Widening her black smile, Red indicated the countless skulls around her in theglen. “I receive many requests. I look forward to hearing yours.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 2 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch2]Without asking permission, Nathan adjusted his cape and took a seat beside thewitch woman on the stone bench. He let out an exaggerated sigh. “I am a thousandyears old, and sometimes I feel the age in my bones.”Nicci looked at the wizard, not hiding her skepticism. She had traveled with himfor many days and many miles, and he had seemed completely healthy and spry. Shedoubted such an obvious ploy for sympathy would work with Red.The crow took wing from the witch woman’s bony shoulder and flapped up to settleon one of the lower branches of the enormous oak. The bird scolded Nathan fromabove.Red shifted her legs and turned toward him. “A thousand years? You must havestories to tell.”“I do indeed, and that is part of the reason I’m here. Since the Palace of theProphets was destroyed, the antiaging spell has failed, so now I grow old as allmortals do.” He looked at Nicci with a twinkle in his eye. “The sorceress isaging too, although she certainly doesn’t show it.”“‘Aging’ is another word for ‘living,’ old man,” Red said with a sharp chuckle.“And I presume you’d like to go on living.”“I’ve just begun to live.” The wizard leaned back on the stone bench as if hewere relaxing in a park. “Now … for my request. I have heard of a thing thatwitch women can do, and I’d be curious if you might do me the honor?”Nicci also listened attentively, just as intrigued, since the wizard had refusedto tell her his plans, despite the lengthy and arduous journey here from thePeople’s Palace.Red tossed her thick braids, making them wriggle like restless snakes on herhead. “Witch women have numerous skills, some wonderful, some dangerous. Itdepends on which ability interests you.”He laced his fingers together over one knee. “The Sisters of the Light possessedjourney books, spell-bonded journals in which they could record their travelsand also send messages over great distances. But a life book … ah, now that issomething different. Have you heard of it?”Red’s intense pale eyes showed her interest. “I’ve heard of many things.” Shepaused for just a moment. “And, yes, that is one of the things I know.”Nathan continued, as if he still needed to explain to the witch woman, or maybeit was for Nicci’s benefit. “A life book chronicles the journey of a person’slife, all the accomplishments and experiences.” He leaned closer to her,adjusting his vest with a tug. Overhead in the tree, the crow cawed.“I would like to have a life book for myself, since I am starting a new phase ofmy existence, a new set of adventures.” He rubbed an imaginary stain from thesleeve of his ruffled shirt, and he looked back at her. “Can you work yourstoryteller magic?”Nicci stood apart from them, watching. Once the wizard got an idea in his head,he was very insistent. She had led Nathan through the untracked wilds to findthe skull-cluttered lair of the witch woman—all because he wanted to ask Red fora book? Nicci said with dry humor, “You lived in a tower for most of your life,Wizard. You think the sum of your experiences would fill an entire book?”Hunter squatted in the dry oak leaves strewn all around. The feline creaturesnuffled the ground, nudging fallen acorns, equally unimpressed with Nathan’srequest.The wizard sniffed. “Given enough time, the interesting events of even a tediouslife can fill a book.” Nathan turned back to Red. “I’ve always been astoryteller myself, and I wrote many popular tales. You may have heard of TheAdventures of Bonnie Day? Or The Ballad of General Utros? Grand epics, andrelevant to the human condition.”Nicci made an acerbic observation. “You were born a prophet, Nathan Rahl. Somewould say that your very profession was to make up stories.”Nathan gave a dismissive gesture. “Yes, some would say that—and these days, withthe great changes in the universe, I’m afraid telling stories is all a prophetcan do.”Red pursed her black lips as she considered. “The stories of your life mightmake a book, Nathan Rahl—and, yes, I do have the magic to extract it. I know aspell that can preserve everything you’ve already done in a single volume, andthat will be the end of its own story.”“Volume one,” Nathan said with delight. “And I am ready to start a new journeywith my sidekick Nicci.”Nicci bristled. “I am no one’s sidekick, Wizard. I am your companion, perhaps,but more accurately, your guardian and protector.”Red said, “Each person is the main character of his own story. That may be howNathan views you, Nicci—as part of his tale.”“Then he would be wrong.” She refused to soften the edge of her tension. “Isthis life book meant to be a biography? Or a work of fiction?”Even Nathan chuckled at that.The crow left its branch, swooped around the clearing, and settled on anotherbough, as if to get a better view.The witch woman rose from the bench. “Your proposal interests me, Nathan Rahl.There is much you need to do—whether or not you know it yet.” When she cast aglance at Nicci, her ropy red locks swung like braided pendulums. “And I knowmuch of your life as well, Nicci. Your past would constitute an epic. Since I amworking the storyteller magic, would you like a life book of your own? It wouldbe my pleasure.” Red had an unsettling hunger behind her sky-blue eyes. “And Ialso know there is an importance to you as well.”Nicci thought of the catastrophes she had survived, the dark deeds she had done,the changes she had undergone, the damage and the triumphs she had left in herwake. She was important? Other than a handful of witnesses and victims along theway, the only one who knew that story was Nicci herself. She gave the witchwoman a cold, hard look. “No, thank you.”After a brief hesitation, the witch woman brushed her hands togetherdismissively and turned with a smile to the wizard. “So, a single life book forNathan Rahl, then.” She left the bench and headed toward her cottage. “First, Iwill need supplies. There are preparations to make.” Red pushed aside thediscolored leather hide that hung across the doorway and ducked inside.Lowering her voice, Nicci turned toward Nathan. “What are you about, Wizard?”He just gave her a smile and a shrug.Red emerged with a small ivory bowl: the rounded top of a human cranium. She setit on the stone bench next to Nathan and reached out to him. “Give me yourhand.”Happy that she had agreed to his request, he extended his hand, palm up. Redtook hold of his fingers, stroking one after another in a strangely eroticgesture. She traced the lines on his palm. “These are your life lines, yourspirit lines, and your story lines. They mark the primary events in your life,like the rings of a tree.” She turned his hand over, studying the veins on theback. “These blood vessels trace the map of your life throughout your body.”When she stroked his veins, Nathan smiled, as if she were flirting with him.“Yes, this is exactly what I need.” Red snatched a knife from a cleverly hiddenpocket in her gray dress and drew the razor-sharp blade across the back of hishand.Nathan yelped, more in disbelief than in pain, as blood gushed out. “What areyou doing, woman?”“You asked for a life book.” She clutched his hand, turning it over so that thered blood could run into the skull bowl. “What did you think we would use forink?”As she squeezed his fingers, trying to milk the flow, Nathan was flustered. “Idon’t believe I thought that far ahead.”“A person’s life book must be written in ink made from the ashes of his blood.”“Of course it does,” Nathan said, as if he had known all along.Nicci rolled her eyes.The blood flowed steadily from the deep gash. Hunter sniffed the air, as ifdrawn by the scent of it.When the skull bowl was a third full of dark red liquid, Nathan said, “Surelythat’s enough by now?”“We’d better make certain,” Red answered. “As you said, you’ve had a very longlife.”Finally satisfied, the witch woman released Nathan’s hand and took the bowl overto her smoky cook fire. With a blackened femur, she prodded the coals, nudgingthem aside to create a sheltered hollow in the ashes. She settled the bone bowlinto them, so the blood could cook.Nathan poked at his cut hand, then released enough magic to heal the wound,careful not to let the blood stain his fine travel clothes.Before long, the blood in the skull bowl began to bubble and smoke. It darkened,then turned black, boiling down to a tarry residue.The light slipping through the crowded branches overhead grew more slanted inthe late afternoon. High above, birds settled among the branches of theexpansive oak for the night. The crow scolded them for their trespass, but thebirds remained.Red ducked back into her cottage, where she rummaged around before returningwith a leather-bound tome that bore no title on the cover or spine. “I happen tohave an empty life book among my possessions. You are fortunate, Nathan Rahl.”“Indeed, I am.”Red squatted next to the cook fire and used two long bones to gingerly removethe skull bowl. The blood ink inside the inverted cranium was even darker thanthe soot charred on the outer surface.Nathan watched with great interest as she set the smoking bowl on the stonebench. She opened the life book to the first page, which was blank, the ivorycolor of freshly boiled bone. “And now to write your story, Nathan Rahl.”She called the crow down from the tree, and the big black bird landed on hershoulder again. It used its sharp black beak to stroke her red braids in a signof affection. The witch woman absently caressed the bird, then seized its neck.Before the bird could squawk or flail, she snapped its neck and caught its bodyas it fell. The dying crow’s wings extended, as if to take flight one last time.Its head lolled to one side.Red rested the dead bird on the bench next to the skull bowl. With nimblefingers, she combed through its tail and wing feathers, finally selecting a longone, which she plucked loose. She held it up for inspection. “Yes, a fine quill.Shall we begin?”After Nathan nodded, the witch woman trimmed the end with her dagger, dipped thepointed shaft into the black ink, and touched it to the blank paper of thewaiting first page."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 3 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch3]The life book wrote itself.Red sat on the stone bench, hands on her knees, not noticing that she left asmear of dark soot on her gray dress. As she worked her spell, a guiding magicsuspended the crow-feather quill upright, and then it moved of its own accord,inscribing the story of Nathan Rahl.Bending closer, the wizard looked on with boyish delight, resting an elbow onhis knee. Nicci stepped up to watch the words spill out across the first page,line after line, and then move on to the next page. Each time the ink ran dry,the feather paused above the book, and Red plucked it out of the air, dipped itinto the bowl of burned blood, and placed it back on the page. The flow of wordsresumed.“I recall how many times I wrote and rewrote The Adventures of Bonnie Day untilI was satisfied with the prose,” Nathan said, shaking his head as he marveled.“This is far easier.”The story flowed, page after page, chronicling Nathan’s long life as a dangerousprophet, how he’d been imprisoned by the Sisters of the Light, first to train,then to control him … how for years they monitored his every utterance ofprophecy, terrified of the turmoil that could arise from false interpretations.And prophecies were nearly always misinterpreted, warnings often misconstrued.Merely trying to avoid a dire fate usually precipitated that exact fate.“People never seem to learn the lesson,” Nathan muttered as he read. “Richardwas right to disregard prophecy for so long.”Nicci agreed. “I am not sorry that prophecy is gone from the world.”The words flew past faster than anyone could read them, and the life book’spages turned of their own accord. Nicci scanned back and forth, catching somesnippets of Nathan’s life, stories she already knew. On the road, he had spentmuch time telling her about himself, whether or not she asked.He leaned closer as a new section began. “Oh, this is a good part.”In his loneliness in the palace, the Sisters had occasionally taken pity onNathan, hiring women from the finer brothels in Tanimura to comfort him.According to the tale as written in the life book, Nathan enjoyed theconversation of an ordinary woman with ordinary dreams and desires. Nathan hadonce whispered a terrible prophecy in the ear of a gullible whore—and thehorrified young woman had run screaming from the Palace of the Prophets. Onceout in the city, she repeated the prophecy to others, and the repercussionsspread and spread, eventually triggering a bloody civil war … all due toNathan’s reckless pillow talk to a woman he would never see again.The Sisters had punished Nathan for that, curtailing his limited freedoms, evenafter he revealed that the supposed “mistake” had accomplished his intent ofkilling a young boy child destined to become a ruthless tyrant, a tyrant whowould have slaughtered countless innocents.“A relatively minor civil war was a small enough price to prevent that outcome,”Nathan remarked as he skimmed the black-blood words scrolling out.When the quill ran dry again, Red dipped it into the skull bowl, stirred theburned blood, and set the feather tip on the page, where it continued to scratchand scrawl.Nathan’s story went on and on—rambling, in Nicci’s opinion—and the feather penwrote word after word. Of course, most of his adventures had occurred only afterhe managed to escape from the palace: his brief romance with Clarissa and itstragic end, his work with Richard Rahl to overthrow the Imperial Order andEmperor Jagang, his battles to stop the evil Hannis Arc and the undead EmperorSulachan.Faster than Nicci expected, the entire volume filled up. When the black bloodfinally reached the last page in the book, the tale ended with theall-too-recent account of Nicci and Nathan trudging through moss-covered skullsto find the witch woman in the Dark Lands. All of the charred-blood ink in theskull bowl was used up, and the lifeless feather dropped and drifted to theground.Nathan was obviously impressed with his own story. “Thank you, Red.” When heclosed the cover, he was delighted to see that his name had appeared on theleather front and on the spine. “I shall carry the life book with me and read itoff and on. I’m certain others would like to read it as well. Scholarlylibraries will want copies.”The witch woman shook her head. “That will not be possible, Nathan Rahl.” Shetook the tome from him. “I agreed to create a life book for you, but I neversaid you could keep it. The volume stays with me. That is my price.”Nathan sputtered. “But that wasn’t what I thought … that isn’t the purpose—”“You did not ask the price beforehand, Wizard,” Nicci said. “After living athousand years, you should be wiser than that.”Red ducked back into her cottage, leaving the volume on the bench, as if daringNathan to take it and escape. He did not. She emerged with a smaller, thinnerleather-bound book, which was also blank. “I will take your life story, but Igive you something that’s worth far more. A new life book filled with potential,rather than stale old words.” She offered it to Nathan. “I have your past, yourold story, but with this book, I give you the rest of your life. Live it the wayyou would want it to be written.”Nathan ran a fingertip over the smooth leather cover, disappointed. “Thank you,I suppose.” He held the book in his hands.“I happen to know that you, and the sorceress, are both vital to the future.”The witch woman stepped uncomfortably close to Nicci and dropped her voice. “Areyou certain you don’t want a life book of your own? There may be things you needto learn.”“I am certain, witch woman. My past is my story to keep, and my future will bewritten by me, in my own way, not through the control or influence of you oranyone else.”“I just wanted to make the offer.” She turned away with a hint of secretamusement in her eyes, followed by a shadow of unexpected concern. “You maystill be required to do things, Sorceress, whether or not you want to hear aboutthem.”Nathan opened his new life book and was surprised to find it wasn’t entirelyblank. “There are words written on the first page. ‘Kol Adair.’” Perplexed, helooked up at Red. “I don’t recognize the term. Is it a name? A place?”“It’s what you will need.” Red bent over her cooking fire and used the blackenedfemur to stir the coals and reawaken the flames. “You must find Kol Adair in theOld World, Nathan Rahl.” She flashed a glance at Nicci. “Both of you.”“We have our own mission,” Nicci said. “Here in the Dark Lands.”“Oh? And what mission is that? To wander aimlessly because you are too much inlove with Richard Rahl to stay at his side? That is a pointless quest. Acoward’s quest.”Nicci felt the heat in her cheeks. “That’s not it at all.”Nathan came to her defense. “After our last great battles, I wanted to come backhere, to see if I could help the people.”Red sniffed. “Another pointless quest. There are always people who need help, nomatter where you go. In the Dark Lands? In the Old World? What is the purpose?Would you rather not save the world and save yourselves?”Nicci turned her anger into annoyance. “You babble nonsense, witch woman.”“Nonsense, is it? Turn the page, Nathan Rahl. Read your new life book.”Curious, the wizard did as she suggested. Nicci leaned close, seeing other wordswritten there on the second page.Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.Kol Adair lies far to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard willbehold what he needs to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must savethe world.Nicci said, “I have helped save the world enough times already.”But Nathan was more perplexed. “This is a game for you, witch woman. You plantedthis joke for us. Why would I need to be made whole again? Am I missingsomething?” He touched his arm, which seemed remarkably intact.“That is not for me to say,” Red said. “You see what’s written, a pathestablished long ago.”“And prophecy is gone,” Nicci said. “Ancient predictions mean nothing.”“Truly?” asked the witch woman. “Even pronouncements made when prophecy was asstrong as the wind and the sun?” While Nathan flexed his fingers, as ifsearching for missing digits, Red brushed back her tangled locks of hair. “Youof all people should know that it is unwise for others to interpret a prophecy.”Nicci tightened the laces on her traveling boots and adjusted her black dress.She could not keep the skepticism out of her voice. “As I said, there is no moreprophecy, witch woman. How can you know where we need to go?”Red’s black lips formed a mysterious smile. “Sometimes I still know things. Ormaybe it is a revelation I foresaw long before the stars changed overhead. But Ido know that if you care about Lord Rahl and his D’Haran Empire, you will heedthis warning and this summons. Kol Adair. You both need to make your way there,whether for the journey or the destination. If you don’t, then all that RichardRahl has worked for may well be forfeit.” She shrugged, suddenly seeming aloof.“Do as you wish.”Nathan slipped the new life book into a leather pouch at his side and closed theflap. “As Lord Rahl’s roving ambassador, my assignment is to travel to placesthat might not know about the changes in the world.” He looked up at thedarkening sky through the canopy of the ancient oak. “But the exact route is atour discretion. We could go to the Old World just as well as to the Dark Lands.”Nicci was not so convinced. “And you are going to take her babblings seriously,Wizard?”Nathan stroked back his long white hair. “Frankly, I’ve had enough of the DarkLands and all this gloom. The Old World has more sunshine.”Nicci considered, realizing she had followed him, but with no real goalotherwise. She just wanted to serve Richard and strengthen his new, solidempire, to help bring about his longed-for golden age. “I have my own ordersfrom Lord Rahl to explore his new empire and send reports back of the things wefind. At Kol Adair, or elsewhere.”“And save the world,” Red added.She did not believe Red’s prediction—how was she supposed to save the world bytraveling to, or seeing, a place she’d never heard of?—but the wizard had avalid point.The Old World, once part of the Imperial Order, was now under the rule ofD’Hara. Even those distant people would want to hear of their freedom, to knowthat Lord Rahl would insist on self-determination and standards of respect. Shehad to see what was out there, and take care of problems she saw, so thatRichard need not be bothered. “Yes, I will go with you.”Nathan adjusted his cape and shouldered his pack, just as eager to depart as hehad been to find the witch woman in the first place, but Nicci hesitated.“Before we go south to the Old World, we need to tell Lord Rahl where we’regoing. We have no way to communicate with him.” She didn’t want Richard orKahlan to worry about the two of them if they disappeared for a time.“We could find a way to send a message when we reach Tanimura,” Nathan said. “Orsome other town along the way.”Red surprised them. “I will take care of it.”She picked up the crow’s limp carcass and cradled the bird in her hands,extending its flopping wings. She adjusted its lolling head, straightened itsbroken neck, then closed her eyes in concentration.After a moment, the crow squirmed and fluffed its feathers. Red set thereanimated bird back on the stone bench, where it tottered drunkenly. The neckremained angled in the wrong direction, and its eyes held no glint of life atall, but it moved, like a marionette. The crow stretched its wings, as iffighting the remnants of death, then folded them back against its sides.“Tear a strip of paper from a page of your life book, Nathan Rahl,” she said,handing him the black quill. “There should be enough ink left for you to write anote for Lord Rahl.”Nathan did so, scratching out a quick summary on a thin curl of paper. When hewas finished, Red rolled it tightly and bound the strip to the crow’s stiff leg.“My bird has sufficient animation to reach the People’s Palace. Lord Rahl willknow where you are going.”She tossed the awkward crow up into the air. Nicci watched the dead bird plummetback to the ground, but at the last moment it extended its wings, stifflyflapped them, rose up beyond the enormous oak, and flew into the dusk.Hunter’s ears perked up, and the catlike creature sniffed the air beforebounding off into the forest to dart among the shadows of the tall trees. Outbeyond Red’s sheltered hollow, Nicci saw a flash of fur, something as large as ahorse prowling through the thickets. Hunter happily bounded after it, frolickingthrough the underbrush, and disappeared along with the large predatory shape inthe deeper gloom.Red looked up. “Hunter’s mother often joins us for dinner.” Her mouth formed anodd smile. “Would you like to stay?”Nicci took note of the strewn bones and skulls and decided not to take furtherrisks. “We should go.”“Thank you, witch woman,” Nathan said as they headed into the thickening night.Even alone in the wild, dark forest, Nicci guessed they would be safer than ifthey chose to stay at Red’s cottage.Nathan strode along, paying no attention to the skulls. “It will be a grandadventure. Once we leave the Dark Lands, we can head south to Tanimura. AtGrafan Harbor, we’re sure to find a ship sailing south. We will find Kol Adair,and that’s just a start.”Richard had told her to go to the boundaries of the D’Haran Empire, and shedecided that the far south was a perfectly viable option. “I suppose the rest ofthe world will be sufficient for our purposes.”* * *After Red watched the two disappear into the forest, Hunter trotted in andsquatted by the cook fire. Moments later, his shaggy mother padded in, as big asa bear and bristling with cinnamon fur. The much smaller son nuzzled her,wanting to play, but Hunter’s mother thrust a huge head forward to Red, whodutifully scratched the silky fur behind the creature’s ears, scrubbing with thenails on both of her hands. Hunter’s mother made a sound that was somewherebetween a growl and a purr; then she slumped heavily among the fallen leaves inthe clearing.Red picked up Nathan’s hefty life book. Yes, even a quiet and tedious life couldadd up to significant events in a thousand years. She knew the real chroniclewas just beginning for Nathan, and the real mission in store for both of them.Even though Nicci refused to let Red create such a book for her, the witch womanhad been an oracle. She knew that the life of the sorceress, both past andfuture, would fill many volumes as well.And the Sorceress must save the world.Carrying Nathan’s tome, Red pushed aside the hanging leather flap over theopening and ducked inside her cottage. The low dwelling was lit with the orangeglow of guttering candles settled in skull pots. The front room was small andcramped, but at the back wall against the hillside, she pushed aside anotherdoor hanging.She entered the main part of her dwelling, a large complex of wide passagewaysand grottoes burrowed into the hillside itself. Red stood before shelves andshelves that were filled with numerous volumes similar to the one she held now.She had collected so many life books over the years, over the centuries, thatshe had lost track.But oddly, and chillingly, every single one of the books had ended with thestrange and previously incomprehensible words:Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.Kol Adair lies far to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard willbehold what he needs to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must savethe world.The same words in every book. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them. Each one withthe same warning.Red slid the story of Nathan Rahl into an empty slot on the shelf next toanother volume. Countless life books, nearly one for each of those skulls buriedunder the moss.…"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 4 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch4]With their new destination in mind, though somewhat skeptical of the importanceRed had assigned to it, the two traveled for weeks through the Dark Lands beforereaching the more populated areas of D’Hara. Heading south, they foundwell-traveled roads and villages, including inns where they could eathome-cooked meals instead of foraging for game or wild fruit, and they couldsleep in actual beds instead of bedding down on the forest floor. As a woodsguide, Richard Rahl had reveled in finding his own trails in the forest, butNicci much preferred civilization, and Nathan certainly did not object tocomforts.Along the way, the two gathered news and disseminated their own tales about LordRahl’s victory over Emperor Sulachan. Most people in the south of D’Hara knewlittle about the political changes that had occurred, but everyone had seen thestars convulse and shift in the sky, and they listened to the travelers withboth wonder and dismay.In the warm, crowded common rooms of inn after inn, Nathan spread his hands andexplained in a deep, confident voice, “Truth be told, the end of prophecy meansthat you can live your own lives and make your own decisions. I was once aprophet myself, and I speak from experience—such powers were far more troublethan they were worth. Good riddance!”Many local oracles and self-proclaimed seers, however, were less enthusiasticabout the changes. Those with a genuine gift had already noticed the sudden lackof ability, and those who continued to sell their predictions were surelycheating gullible customers. Such “prophets” were incensed to hear themselvesdenounced as frauds and charlatans.But chastising frauds was not the mission Nicci had adopted, nor did sheconsider it “saving the world.” She moved ahead with her next goal in sight. Shewould go to the Old World, scout the new lands Lord Rahl now ruled, and helpNathan find the mysterious Kol Adair, whatever it was. Tanimura would be theirstarting point. The great port city was one of the northernmost bastions of theOld World, a place where the main overland trade routes converged.As the two neared the coast, the air took on a fresh, salty bite. Trafficincreased on the wide road through the coastal hills. Creaking mule-drawn cartspassed them, as well as wealthy noblemen or merchants riding well-groomed horseswith expensive tack. Farmers guided wagons laden with vegetables or sacks ofgrain, heading to the markets in the port city.While walking along in the warm sun, the wizard held up his end of theconversation—more than his end, in fact, but Nicci saved her energy for thehike. When they reached the top of a hill, the view unfolded before them.The old, sprawling city of Tanimura had been built on a long peninsula thatextended into the sparkling blue expanse of the ocean. To the west, beforespilling into the sea, the Kern River had excavated a broad valley. Croplandsand villages dotted the countryside, interspersed with patches of dark forest.Nicci’s focus, though, was on the whitewashed buildings of the extensive city.The wizard stopped to rest, shading his eyes. “A splendid view. Think of all thepossibilities Tanimura offers.” He plucked at his threadbare sleeves, his frayedcuffs, his open vest. “Including fresh clothes.”Nicci said in a quiet voice, “It’s been years since I was here.” She narrowedher blue eyes, scanning the city, noting what she remembered and what hadchanged.The wizard gave a noncommittal grunt. “Once I escaped the palace, I thought Iwould never come back … yet here we are.”Down the sweep of shore, Grafan Harbor was bustling with large cargo or militaryships that sported creamy white sails, as well as fishing dhows with triangularsails. Nicci’s lips quirked in a small, hard smile. “I see they’ve managed torebuild the docks.”In the harbor here, she and her fellow Sisters of the Dark had destroyed theLady Sefa, the ship that had held them hostage. Emperor Jagang had granted thewomen their revenge on Captain Blake and his vile crew, even encouraged it, andNicci and her companions were not kind to the sailors who had raped and abusedthem. The Sisters had found a turnabout pleasure, peeling off the soft flesh ofthe men, strip by strip. Then, unleashing the full force of Subtractive Magic,they had destroyed the Lady Sefa, lifting the entire vessel out of the water,snapping the masts like twigs, crashing the huge ship down onto the Grafandocks, and then wreaking havoc upon the whole harbor, as if the other ships wereno more than the toys of a malicious child.Although that had been one of her darkest times, Nicci still smiled at thememory.Nathan also stared down toward the crowded city, lost in his own memories. Helowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “We both left such a mark onTanimura, dear Sorceress, they might not welcome us back.”His gaze was drawn toward the southern end of the peninsula and a large islandjust off the coast. Halsband Island had once been connected to the mainland by aprominent stone bridge that allowed visitors, merchants, scholars, and Sistersof the Light to pass directly to the Palace of the Prophets. The mammoth edificehad stood for millennia, a place where gifted males were imprisoned and taught.The palace had been shielded in numerous ways, woven with a spell that preventedits inhabitants from aging … but Nathan had triggered a light web, bringing downthe entire imposing palace so that its magical archives could not fall intoJagang’s hands.Halsband Island looked like a wasteland now, the palace vaporized. From whatNicci could tell, even after six years no hardy souls had returned to claim thedevastated land for their own.The wizard wore a bittersweet expression, but forced a smile. “I spent athousand years there. What could be a better start to a new life than to eraseall signs of the past?” He pushed aside his dark blue cape and patted theleather pouch at his side that held the new life book and its ominouspronouncement. “It’s time for a new adventure, before we get too old. You and Iare not used to aging at the same rate as everyone else. Tanimura awaits.”Nicci set off down the road to the city. As they walked down the hill, an oxcartrolled past, driven by an old farmer wearing a straw hat. The man stared at theroad ahead as if it were the most interesting thing in the world. His cart wasloaded with round green melons.When Nathan asked for a ride, the old farmer gave them a casual gesture. The twosat in the back of the wagon among the piled round melons. Nicci picked up one.“It looks like a severed head.” The ox plodded along, not caring whether theroad went uphill or downhill.Jostled by the slow, uneven cart, Nicci watched the approaching city. Sheremembered the tree-lined boulevards, the tall whitewashed buildings, the tileroofs. Banners flew from high poles, scarlet pennants of the city of Tanimuraand larger flags of the D’Haran Empire.She and Richard had stopped here for a time on their way to Altur’Rang, when shehad forced him to play the role of her husband, hoping to convince him tobelieve in the Order. She had been so passionate, determined, ruthless, and sonaive. He had learned how to cut stone here in Tanimura.…Nicci’s brow furrowed at the troubling memory. “We will not stay long, Wizard.We’ll get supplies for a long journey and find a ship sailing south to the OldWorld. I’m sure you’re anxious to find your Kol Adair.”“And you must save the world, of course.” Nathan winced as the oxcart rolledover a large rock in the road, and one large melon rolled over the edge, but hedeftly caught it and set it back on the precarious pile. “But why in such ahurry? Dear spirits, we traveled weeks to get to Tanimura. If that prophecy waswritten down a hundred years ago, there can’t possibly be any rush.”“Whether or not the witch woman is correct, Lord Rahl asked us to explore thefringes of his empire and to spread the terms of his rule. Everyone here alreadyknows who he is. Our real work lies elsewhere.”“Indeed it does,” Nathan admitted with a sigh. “And I’m curious to find thisplace called Kol Adair that Red thinks I need to see.”He looked at his shirt, then tried to brush away a grease stain from a rabbitthey’d eaten in camp, and a spot of gravy that signified the much better foodthat an innkeeper had prepared for them the following night. “Before we can goon, though, my first order of business will be to acquire a new travelingwardrobe. Without a doubt, Tanimura has many tailors and garment shops to choosefrom. I believe I can find what I need.”Nicci’s black traveling dress was still in good shape, and she had a spare inher pack. “You worry about clothes altogether too much.”He looked down his nose at her. “I spent a thousand years wearing frumpy robesin the Palace of the Prophets. Now that I am out in the world at last, I amentitled to indulge myself.”Nicci knew she wouldn’t change his mind. “I’ll make my way down to the harborand make inquiries with the dockmaster. I can learn which ships are ready todepart and where they are bound.”More carts joined them on the road, and they passed stables on the outskirts ofthe city, livestock yards where pigs and cattle wandered about, unconcerned withtheir fates. Charcoal kilns stood like tall beehives, letting a whisper of sweetsmoke into the air. Across a meeting square, shirtless carpenters were buildinga tall tower that so far consisted only of support beams.The listless cart driver did not speak a word to them, merely drove his oxalong. As the city buildings clustered together, the crowds increased, as didthe noise. People shouted to one another, merchants hawked their wares,washerwomen hung dripping clothes from lines strung between buildings.Not far away they saw a large market crowded with rickety wooden stallsfeaturing good-luck trinkets, bolts of patterned fabric, wooden carvings,fire-glazed clay pots, and bunches of red and orange flowers. The old farmerflicked the ox with a switch to turn the animal toward the market, and Nicci andNathan slid off the cart, ready to venture into the heart of the city. Thewizard called out his thanks, but the old farmer didn’t respond.As he stood to get his bearings, Nathan adjusted the ornate sword in itsscabbard, checked the life book, straightened his pack, and self-consciouslybrushed down the front of his shirt. “I may be a while. Once I secure theservices of an adequate tailor, I’ll have him make more appropriate attire forme. Capes, shirts, vests, new boots. Yes, yes, if I am to be Lord Rahl’sambassador, I must look the part.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 5 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch5]The ancient city of Tanimura was full of wonders, distractions, and dangers forthe unwary. Nicci felt right at home.She was all business as she made her way into the thick of the city, her mindset on finding a southbound ship and a captain familiar with the port cities inthe Old World. From what the witch woman had described, Kol Adair might be farout in the sparsely populated fringe lands, not marked on common maps. But theywould find it.During her years serving Emperor Jagang, when she had been called Death’sMistress, Nicci had brought many outlying towns under the rule of the ImperialOrder. Although Jagang had been intent on conquering the New World, he hadlittle interest in the less populated areas far to the south of his own empire.He had once told her the land did not hold enough subjects or enough wealth tobe worth his time.Despite the distance, Nicci was convinced that those far-flung people alsoneeded to know about Lord Rahl. She would be proud to tell them of their newlife without tyrants and oppression, and she relished the challenge. She woulddo it for Richard.Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.As she headed down toward the harbor, the streets were steep and winding. Thecrowded buildings were stacked haphazardly, two- and three-story structures thatfilled any spare patch of ground, buildings erected on top of buildings. Somehomes and shops were tilted as if trying to keep their balance on the hillsides.Gutters lined the streets, filled with a brownish slurry of rainwater mixed withemptied chamber pots.Broad-hipped women gathered and gossiped around a well, pulling up buckets offresh water, which they handed to glum-looking teenagers to carry away. Scruffybarking dogs ran down the streets in pursuit of loose chickens.Nicci passed through a fabric dyers’ district, where the air was filled with arich and complicated tapestry of sharp, sour odors. Cloth merchants hung boltsof dripping fabric—indigo, saffron yellow, or stark black—which flapped in thesea breezes as they dried. In the thread makers’ district, boys ran down thestreet pulling long colorful strands, twisting bobbins to tighten the threads.The tanning district reeked as leather workers cured and processed hides. Takingadvantage of the foul smells, enterprising children ran about offering to sellpassersby fistfuls of mint leaves as nosegays. A little girl with black hair inpigtails ran up to Nicci, waving the mint leaves. “Only a copper. It’ll makeevery breath smell fresh.”Nicci shook her head. “The smell of death doesn’t bother me.”The skinny girl could not hide her disappointment. She was dressed in rags, andher face was covered with dust and grime. She looked as if she hadn’t had a goodbath, or a good meal, in some time. Noting her industriousness, Nicci gave herthe copper anyway, and the girl ran off laughing.The markets were loud, colorful storms of people, vendors hawking shellfish orlive octopus from buckets of murky salt water. Butchers sold slabs of exoticimported meats—ostrich, musk ox, zebra, even a greasy gray steak supposedly froma long-tailed gar—spread out on planks for display, although many of the meatsdrew more flies than customers. Smoked fish dangled by their tails across woodenracks like succulent battle trophies.Food vendors sold skewers of spiced meat sizzling over charcoal fires. Bakersoffered loaves of knotted brown bread. Two women stirred a steaming cauldron andladled out bowls of what they called “kraken chowder,” a milky stew with threadyseaweed, bobbing onions, and rings of tender suckers that had been sliced fromsome large tentacle.Nicci walked at a brisk pace, uninterested in the distractions. Jugglersperformed in the streets, gamblers placed bets on a game of shells and cups. Amusician sat on an overturned pot eliciting caterwauling sounds from a flexiblestringed instrument.In the spice merchants’ district, men in long green robes haggled over the priceof cumin, turmeric, cardamom. A toothless old woman squatted on a curb as shesorted lumpy roots of mandrake and ginger. When an errant breeze whispered alongthe street, the spice merchants rushed to cover their powder-filled baskets. Oneman bent over a clay bowl of red pepper, and the breeze feathered some of itinto his face, making him cough and retreat, flailing his hands.Tanimura was a crowded, vibrant city. Every person here was concerned witheveryday living, but few of them considered the larger work of building andmaintaining the D’Haran Empire. These people weren’t soldiers. They had livedfor years under the Imperial Order. They had survived the turmoil of the long,bloody war, and now they might not even realize how fundamentally theirexistence had changed. If Lord Rahl’s rule endured, these people might neverneed to concern themselves much about it.As she worked her way into the older, more crowded district just above theharbor, the streets grew tighter and more tangled. The buildings were tall anddingy, and every street degenerated into an alley. More than once, she foundherself at a dead end of brick walls and garbage, forcing her to retrace hersteps.Nicci turned down a wider alley between leaning three-story buildings withcracked and stained walls. The buildings closed into shadows redolent ofstagnant water, rats, and refuse. She pressed forward, supposing the passagewaywould open into a broader thoroughfare, but instead it turned along oddly skewedcorners, and the passage narrowed.Ahead, she heard a frightened shout and the sounds of a scuffle—curses, grufflaughter, the smack of a fist striking flesh, then the more muffled sound ofboots kicking. She was already running toward the sounds when an outcry of painjoined what sounded like a little boy’s mocking laughter.“That’s all the money I have!” It was a young man’s voice.Nicci rounded the corner to come upon three muscular men and a wiry boy, allbunched around a young man of perhaps twenty years. It took her only an instantto gauge the tableau, identify the predators, the victim. The young man corneredby these thugs didn’t look like a Tanimuran. He had long ginger hair and paleskin covered with freckles; his hazel eyes were wide with fear.He swung at his attackers, but the three larger men pummeled him with theirfists. It was like a game to them, and they seemed in no hurry. The boy, no morethan ten years old, pranced from one foot to the other, clutching a small sackof coins in his hand, obviously stolen from the victim.One of the thugs, a heavyset man with short but extraordinarily muscular arms,planted a solid kick on the meat of the victim’s thigh. The red-haired young manwent down, sliding against the slimy, stained wall. Even as he fell, he kept hisarms up in an attempt to fend them off.Nicci said, “Stop what you’re doing.” It wasn’t a shout, but hard enough to drawtheir attention like an unexpected slap.The three men spun to look at her in surprise. The curly-haired boy’s eyes wentas wide and bright as coins, and he bolted down the winding alley, disappearingas quickly as a cockroach revealed by the light. Nicci ignored the child andfaced the three men, the real threat.The thugs turned toward her, ready for a fight, but when they saw only anattractive blonde in a black dress, their expressions changed. One let out aguffaw. They spread out so they could come at her from different directions.The squat heavyset man called after the boy, who had disappeared down thealleys. “There’s no need to run, you little bastard. It’s just a woman.”“Let him run, Jerr—we’ll find him later,” said a second man. He was swarthy witha round face and bloodshot eyes that probably resulted from long familiaritywith alcohol, rather than lack of sleep.“We don’t want the little brat to see what we’re going to do with her anyway,”said the third man, with greasy brown hair tied back in a ponytail. “He’s tooyoung for that kind of education.”The ginger-haired victim tried to get up. He was bleeding from his nose, and hisshirt was torn. “They stole my money!”The man with bloodshot eyes smacked him hard across the face. The young man’shead hit the alley wall hard.Although she felt coldness rise within her, Nicci didn’t move toward them.“Perhaps you didn’t hear me. I told you to stop.”“We’re just getting started,” said Jerr, the leader. In unison, the three mendrew their knives. Apparently, beating the young man wasn’t enoughentertainment, and they had something else in mind for Nicci. Such men usuallydid.Leering, they came toward her. The man with the ponytail slid around to cut offher retreat—but she had no intention of retreating. They obviously expected herto run in fear, but that was not something Nicci did.“Nice black dress,” said Jerr, holding up his knife. “But we’d rather see youwithout it. Makes things easier.”The young redhead tried to scramble to his feet, pressing a hand to his bruisedthigh. “You leave her alone!”The man with bloodshot eyes snarled at him. “How many teeth do you want to losebefore this day is out?”Nicci regarded the three of them with an icy gaze. “It has been several weekssince I had occasion to kill a man.” She looked from one to the next. “Now Ihave three in one day.”The thugs were startled by her boldness, and the heavyset Jerr laughed. “How doyou expect to do that? You don’t even have a weapon.”Nicci stood with her hands loose at her sides, her fingers curled. “I am theweapon.” From within, she summoned her magic. She had countless ways to killthese men.The redhead finally managed to stand, and he foolishly lurched toward them,calling out to Nicci. “I won’t let them hurt you!” He dove at the legs of theman with the ponytail, knocking him to the ground.Bloodshot Eyes raised his knife and advanced toward Nicci, waving the point backand forth in the air in front of her, as if she was supposed to be intimidated.Jerr called out, “Cut her, Henty, but don’t hurt her too bad—not yet. I don’twant her blood all over me when I get between her legs.”Nicci could have unleashed wizard’s fire and incinerated the three of them in aninstant, but she might also kill the young man, as well as start a fire thatcould rage through the old town. That was unnecessary. She had other means.Nicci created a wall of air that slammed into Henty, and he looked as if he hadblindly smashed into an invisible tree. As he stood momentarily stunned, Nicciused the magic to fling him up and back fifteen feet above the ground. She wasnot gentle—she had no reason to be.Bloodshot Eyes slammed into the high wall, and the impact crushed his head likeone of the dark melons in the farmer’s oxcart. A splash of red painted a broadround splatter on the already stained wall; then the body traced a long unevensmear as it slid two stories down to the ground.Unable to believe what he had just seen, Jerr also came at Nicci with a knife.She used her powers to crush his larynx so he couldn’t scream; then she pulpedthe bones in his neck for good measure. The leader’s eyes bulged, bursting witha sudden web of red hemorrhages, and his head flopped to one side. When hisknees gave out, he sprawled forward.Ponytail kicked his way free of the scrappy redhead, who had tackled him, andslashed his knife across the empty air, trying to cut the young man, who duckedout of the way. Then, the last thug turned to snarl at Nicci.She stopped his heart, and he dropped to the ground like a felled bull.The young redhead looked around the carnage. “We’re saved!” His face had gonepale, which made his freckles even more prominent. He gaped at the three deadmen lying in the garbage in the alley. “You killed them! Sweet Sea Mother,you—you killed them. You didn’t have to do that.”“Maybe not,” Nicci said, “but that was the most convenient solution. They madethe decision for me. Those men would have preyed on others, robbed others—andeventually they would have been caught. I was saving time and effort for themagistrate and the hangman.”The distraught redhead couldn’t decide what to do. His lip was bloody, his facepuffy and bruised. “It’s just—they took my money, but I doubt they were going tokill me.”Nicci ran her gaze up and down his lanky form. The young man wore a loosehomespun shirt dyed brown and sturdy canvas pants of the kind worn by sailors.He didn’t have any weapons she could see, not even a knife at his side. “Youdon’t think they were going to kill you? That is not a gamble I’d choose tomake.”He swallowed hard, and she was struck by how innocent and foolish he seemed. Ifeven the bruises and the loss of his money purse had not taught him thenecessary lesson, then Nicci would not waste further time on him. “If you keepwalking these alleys, unarmed and unaware, you will soon have anotheropportunity to learn whether or not the thieves around here intend to kill you.”She turned to walk away. “Don’t count on me being here to help next time.”The young man hurried after her. “Thank you! Sorry I didn’t say that soonenough—thank you. I was raised to show gratitude to those who do good things forme. I appreciate it. My name is Bannon … Bannon—” He paused as if embarrassed.“Bannon Farmer. I’m from Chiriya Island. This is my first time in Tanimura.”Nicci kept walking. “I guessed that much, and it may be your last time inTanimura if you don’t stop being such a fool.”Bannon followed, still talking. “I used to be a cabbage farmer, but I wanted tosee the world, so I signed aboard a sailing ship. This is my first time inport—and I came to buy a sword of my own.” He frowned, and patted his hipsagain, as if he somehow thought he had only imagined the robbery. “They took mymoney. That boy—”Nicci showed neither surprise nor sympathy. “He bolted off. You’ll never findhim. That child is lucky he ran, though—I would have disliked killing a littleboy, even if he was a thief.”Bannon’s shoulders slumped. “I was looking for a swordsmith. Those men seemednice, and they told me to follow them, led me down here.” He shook his head. “Iguess I should have been more suspicious.” He brightened. “But you were there.You saved me. Are you a sorceress? I’ve never seen anything like that. Thank youfor rescuing me.”She turned to face him. “And shame on you for needing to be rescued. You shouldpossess more common sense than to let yourself become a victim. I have no mercyfor thugs and thieves, but there would be no thieves if there weren’t fools likeyou to prey upon.”Bannon’s face turned a bright red. “I’m sorry. I’ll know better next time.” Hewiped at the blood coming from his lip and nose, then smeared it on his pants.“But if I had my own sword I could’ve defended myself.”He leaned against the alley wall and struggled to pull off his left boot. “MaybeI have enough coins left, though.” When he upended the boot, several coinsrained out, two silvers and five coppers. He held them in his palm. “I learnedthis trick from my father. He taught me never to keep all your money in oneplace, in case you get robbed.” He looked forlornly down at the coins in hishand. “It isn’t enough to buy much of a sword. I had hoped for a fine blade witha golden hilt and pommel, intricate workings. The coins might be enough, though.Just enough…”“A sword doesn’t have to be pretty to be effective at killing,” Nicci said.“I suppose it doesn’t,” Bannon replied as he replaced the coins in his boot, andstomped his foot back into place. He looked back down the alley at the bodies ofthe three thugs. “You didn’t need a sword at all.”“No, I don’t,” Nicci said. “But what I do need is a ship sailing south.” Shebegan to walk back out of the alley. “I was on my way to the harbor.”“A ship?” Bannon hurried after her, still trying to adjust his boot. “I’m from aship—the Wavewalker, a three-masted carrack out of Serrimundi. Captain Eli isdue to set sail again as soon as his cargo is loaded. Probably with the outgoingtide tonight. He’d take passengers. I could put in a good word for you.”“I can find him myself,” Nicci said, then softened her voice, realizing that theyoung man was just trying to help. “Thank you for the recommendation.”Bannon beamed. “It’s the least I could do. You saved me. The Wavewalker is agood ship. It’ll serve your needs.”“I will ask,” Nicci said.The young man brushed himself off. “And I’m going to buy my own sword so I won’tbe helpless next time I get in trouble.” With an inappropriate display ofconscience, he stared at the dead thugs in the alley shadows. “But what shall wedo about them?”Nicci didn’t bother to look back over her shoulder. “The rats will find themsoon enough.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 6 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch6]After the sorceress went on her way, Bannon wiped blood from his lip and feltthe bruise. He tried to fashion a smile, which only made the pain worse, but hesmiled anyway. He had to smile, or his fragile world would fall apart.His canvas trousers were scuffed and stained, but they were durable work pants,a farmer’s garment made to last, and they had served him well aboard the ship.His homespun shirt was now torn in two places, but he would have time to mend itonce the Wavewalker set sail. There would be quiet listless days adrift on thewater as they voyaged south, and Bannon was handy enough with a needle andthread. He could make it right again.Someday, he would have a pretty wife to make new clothes and do the mending, ashis mother had done on Chiriya Island. They would have spunky, bright-eyedchildren—five of them, he decided. He and his wife would laugh together … unlikehis mother, who had not laughed often. It would be different with him, becausehe would be different from his father, so very different.The young man shuddered, took a breath, and forced his mind back to the brightand colorful picture he liked to hold in his mind. Yes. A warm cottage, a lovingfamily, a life well lived …He habitually brushed himself off again, and the smile felt real this time. Hepretended he didn’t even notice the bruises on his face and leg. It would be allright. It had to be.He walked out into the bright and open city streets. The sky was clear and blue,and the salt air smelled fresh, blowing in from the harbor. Tanimura was a cityof marvels, just as he had dreamed it would be.During his voyage from Chiriya Island, he had asked the other sailors to tellhim stories about Tanimura. The things they had described seemed impossible, butBannon’s dreams were not impossible, and so he believed them—or at least gavethem the benefit of the doubt.As soon as the Wavewalker had come into port and tied up to the pier, Bannon hadbounded down the gangplank, enthusiastic to find the city—at least something inhis life—to be the way he wanted it to be. The rest of the crew took their payand headed for the dockside taverns, where they would eat food that wasn’t fish,pickled cabbage, or salt-preserved meat, and they would drink themselves into astupor. Or they would pay the price asked by the … special ladies who werewilling to spread their legs for any man. Such women did not exist in thebucolic villages on Chiriya—or if they did, Bannon had never seen them (not thathe had ever looked).When he was deep in drink, Bannon’s father had often called his mother a whore,usually before he beat her, but the Wavewalker sailors seemed delighted by theprospect of whores, and they didn’t seem interested at all in beating suchwomen, so Bannon didn’t understand the comparison.He gritted his teeth and concentrated on the sunshine and the fresh air.Absently, he pulled back his long ginger hair to keep it out of his way. Theother sailors could have their alehouses and their lusty women. Since this washis first time here, Bannon wanted to get drunk on the sights of Tanimura, onthe wonder of it all. He had always imagined that the world would be like this.This was the way the world was supposed to be.The white tile-roofed buildings were tall, with flower boxes under the openwindows. Colorful laundry hung on ropes strung from window to window. Laughingchildren ran through the streets chasing a ball that they kicked and threw whilerunning, a game that seemed to have no set rules. A mop-headed boy bumped intohim, then rebounded and ran off. Bannon felt his trousers, his pocket—the boyhad brushed against him there, possibly in an attempt to pick his pocket, butBannon had no more coins for the would-be thief, since he’d already been robbed.The last of his money was safely tucked in the bottom of his boot, and he hopedit would be enough to buy a reasonable sword.He took two breaths, closed his eyes, opened them again. He made the smile comeback and deliberately chose to believe that the street urchin had just bumpedinto him, that he wasn’t a feral pickpocket trying to take advantage of adistracted stranger.Searching for a swordsmith, Bannon emerged into a main square that overlookedthe sparkling blue water and crowded sailing ships. A heavy woman pushed a cartfilled with clams, cockles, and gutted fish. She seemed unenthusiastic about herwares. Older fishermen with swollen, arthritic knuckles worked at knotting andreknotting torn fishing nets; their hands somehow remained nimble through thepain. Gulls flew overhead, wheeling in aimless circles, or shrieked and foughtover whatever scraps they had found to eat.Bannon came upon a tanner’s shop where a round-faced man with a fringe of darkhair wore a leather apron. The tanner scraped and trimmed cured skins while hismatronly wife knelt at a wide washtub, shoving her hands into bright green dye,immersing leather pieces.“Excuse me,” Bannon said, “could you recommend a good sword maker? One with fairprices?”The woman looked up at him. “Wanting to join Lord Rahl’s army, are you? The warsare over. It’s a new time of peace.” She ran her eyes up and down his lankyform. “I don’t know how desperate they are for fighters anymore.”“No, I don’t want to join the army,” Bannon said. “I’m a sailor aboard theWavewalker, but I’m told that every good man should have a good blade—and I’m agood man.”“Are you now?” said the leatherworker with a good-natured snort. “Then maybe youshould try Mandon Smith. He has blades of all types, and I’ve never heard acomplaint.”“Where would I find him? I’m new to the city.”The leatherworker raised his eyebrows in amusement. “Are you now? I wouldn’thave guessed.”The tanner’s wife lifted her hands out of the dye basin. They were bright greenup near the elbows, but her hands and wrists were a darker color, permanentlystained from her daily work. “Down two streets, after you smell a pickler’sshop, you’ll find a candle maker.”The leatherworker interrupted, “Don’t buy candles there. He’s a cheat—usesmostly lard instead of beeswax, so the candles melt in no time.”“I’ll remember that,” Bannon said. “But I’m not looking to buy candles.”The woman continued, “Pass the dry fountain, and you’ll find the sword maker’sshop. Mandon Smith. Fine blades. He works hard, gives a fair price, but don’tinsult him by asking for a discount.”“I—I won’t.” Bannon lifted his chin. “I’ll be fair, if he is.”He left the tanners and went off. He found the pickler’s shop with nodifficulty. The tang of vinegar stung his eyes and nose, but when he saw largeclay jars with salted fermenting cabbage, his stomach felt suddenly queasy, andunbidden bile came up in his throat. It reminded him too much of the stink ofhis old home, of the cabbage fields on Chiriya, of the bottomless prison pitthat would have been his life back there. Cabbages, and cabbages, and cabbages …The young man walked on, shaking his head to clear away the smell. He passed thedisreputable candle maker without a second glance, then marveled at an elaboratefresco painted on the long wall of a public building. It depicted some dramatichistorical event, but Bannon did not know his history.He found the dry fountain, which was adorned with the statue of some beautifulsea nymph. Tanimura was so full of marvels, he almost didn’t want to leave here,even after being robbed and nearly murdered. Was that any worse than what he hadleft behind?He had fled his home in desperation, but he also wanted to see the world, sailthe oceans, go from one port city to another. It wouldn’t be right to remain inthe first place he saw. But he was certainly impressed with that beautiful andfrighteningly powerful sorceress, who was unlike anyone he had ever met onChiriya.…After spotting the sword maker’s shop at the end of the street, he sat on theedge of the dry fountain, pulled off his left boot, and upended it so that thecoins fell into his palm; two silvers and five coppers. That was all. He had ablister from the coins in his shoe, but he was glad he had taken the precaution.He’d learned that lesson from his father.Never put all your money in one place.Bannon swallowed hard and walked up to the sword maker. Fine blades.Self-consciously, he touched his empty pockets again. “I need to buy a sword,sir.”Mandon Smith was a dark-skinned man with a polished bald head and a bushy blackbeard. “I would imagine that to be the case, young man, since you’ve come to asword maker’s shop. I have blades of all kinds. Long swords, short swords,curved blades, straight blades, full guards, open hilts—all the finest steel. Idon’t sell poor quality.” He gestured to show an array of swords, so many typeson display that Bannon didn’t know how to assess them. “What type of sword wereyou looking for?”Bannon looked away, wiped at the bruise on his face. “I’m afraid you might notbe able to provide the type of sword I need.”Mandon palmed his bushy beard, but the hairs promptly sprang back out into itsfull brush. “I can make any kind of sword, young man.”Bannon brightened. “Then, the sword I require is … an affordable one.”The swordsmith was startled by the answer. His face darkened in a frown beforehe burst out laughing. “A difficult request indeed! Precisely how affordable didyou mean?”Bannon held out all of his remaining coins. Mandon let out a long, discouragedsigh. “Quite a challenge.” His lips quirked in a smile. “It wouldn’t be right tolet a man go without a blade, however. Tanimura has some dangerous streets.”Bannon swallowed. “I discovered that already.”Mandon led him inside the shop. “Let’s see what we can find.” The smith begansorting flat blank strips of metal that had not yet been fashioned and forged.He rummaged through half-finished long swords, broken blades, ornate daggers,serrated hunting knives, even a short flat knife that looked incapable ofanything more dangerous than cutting cheese or spreading butter.The smith stopped to ponder one clunky-looking blade as long as Bannon’s arm. Ithad a straight, unornamented cross guard, a small round pommel. The grip waswrapped in leather strips, with no fancy carving, wire workings, or inlaidjewels. The blade looked discolored, as if it hadn’t been forged as perfectly asthe other blades. It had no fuller groove, no engraving. It was just a simple,sturdy sword.Mandon hefted it, held the grip in his right hand, tossed it to the left. Hemoved his wrist, felt the weight of it, watched it flow through the air. “Trythis one.”Bannon caught the sword, fearing he would drop it with an embarrassing clatterto the floor of the shop, but his hand seemed to go right to the hilt. Hisfingers wrapped around the grip, and the leather helped him hold on. “It feelssolid at least. Sturdy.”“Aye, that it is. And the blade is sharp. It’ll hold an edge.”“I had imagined something a little more—” Bannon frowned, searching for wordsthat would not insult the swordsmith. “A little more elegant.”“Have you counted the number of coins you’ve got to spend?”“I have,” Bannon said, letting his shoulders fall. “And I understand.”Mandon clapped him on the back, a blow that was much harder than he expected.“Get your priorities straight, young man. When a victim is staring at a bladethat has just plunged through his chest, the last thing on his mind is criticismabout the lack of ornamentation on your hilt.”“I suppose not.”Mandon looked down at the plain blade and mused, “This sword was made by one ofmy most talented apprentices, a young man named Harold. I tasked him with makinga good and serviceable sword. It took him four tries, but I knew his potential,and I was willing to invest four sword blanks on him.”The smith tapped his fingernail on the solid blade, eliciting a clear metallicclink. “Harold made this sword to prove to me it was time he became ajourneyman.” He smiled wistfully, brushing his spiky black beard with one hand.“And he did. Three years after that, Harold was such a good craftsman that hecreated a fantastically elaborate, perfect sword—his masterpiece. So I named hima master.” He squared his shoulders and leaned back with a wry sigh. “Now, he’sone of my biggest competitors in Tanimura.”Bannon looked at the sword with greater appreciation now.Mandon continued, “That just makes my point—it may not look like much, but thisis a very well crafted sword, and it will serve the needs of the rightperson—unless your needs are to impress some pretty girl?”Bannon felt a flush come to his cheeks. “I’ll have to do that some other way,sir. This sword will be for my own protection.” He lifted the blade, tried it inboth hands, swung it in a slow, graceful arc. Oddly, it felt good—perhapsbecause otherwise he had had no sword at all.“It’ll do that,” said the swordsmith.Bannon squared his shoulders, nodding absently. “A man never knows when he mightneed to protect himself or his companions.”The dark edges of the world infringed upon his vision. Marvelous Tanimura seemedto have more shadows than before, more slinking, dark things in corners, ratherthan bright sunlit colors. Hesitating, he held out the coins, everything thatthe thieves hadn’t taken from him. “You’re sure this is enough money?”The swordsmith removed the coins, one at a time, the two silvers then four ofthe coppers, closing Bannon’s fingers on the last one. “I would never take aman’s last coin.” He gestured with his bald head. “Let’s go outside. I have apractice block in back.”Mandon took him behind the smithy to a small yard with barrels of scum-coveredwater for cooling his blades, a grinding wheel and whetstones for sharpening theedges. An upright, battered pine log as tall as a man had been mounted andbraced in the center of a dirt clearing strewn with straw. Fragrant piles offresh pale wood chips lay around it on the ground.Mandon pointed to the scarred upright log. “That is your opponent—defendyourself. Imagine it is one of the soldiers of the Imperial Order. Hah, why notimagine it’s Emperor Jagang himself?”“I already have enough enemies in my imagination,” Bannon muttered. “We don’tneed to add to them.”He stepped up to the practice block and swung the sword, bracing for the smackof impact when the blade hit the pine wood. The vibrations reverberated up tohis elbow.The swordsmith was not impressed. “Are you trying to cut down a sunflower, myboy? Swing!”Bannon swung again, harder this time, resulting in a louder thunk. A dry chunkof bark fell off the practice block.“Defend yourself!” yelled Mandon.He swung harder with a grunt from the effort, and this time the impact thrummedthrough his wrist, jarred his forearm, his elbow, all the way to his shoulder.“I’ll defend myself,” he whispered. “I won’t be helpless.”But he hadn’t always been able to defend himself, or his mother.Bannon struck again, imagining that the blade was cutting not into wood, butthrough flesh and hard bone. He hacked again.He remembered coming home barely an hour after sunset one night on the island.He had been working as a hand in the Chiriya cabbage fields, like all the otheryoung men his age. He had to work for wages rather than working his family’s ownland, because his father had lost their holdings long before. It wasn’t evendinnertime yet, but his father was already out of the house, surely halfwaydrunk by now in the tavern. Getting drunk was about the only thing at which hisfather showed any efficiency.At least that meant their cottage would be quiet, granting Bannon and his motheran uneasy peace. From his fieldwork in the past week, Bannon had earned a fewmore coins, paid that day—it was the height of the cabbage harvest, and thewages were better than usual.He had already saved enough money to buy his own passage off of Chiriya Island.He could have left a month ago, and he remembered how he had longed to be gonefrom this place, staring at the infrequent trading ships as they sailed awayfrom port. Such vessels stopped in the islands only once every month or two,since the islanders had little to trade and not much money to buy importedgoods. Even though it would be some time before he had another chance, Bannonhad made up his mind that he wouldn’t go—couldn’t go—until he could take hismother with him. They would both sail away and find a perfect world, a peacefulnew home like all those lands he had heard of—Tanimura, the People’s Palace, theMidlands. Even the wild uncivilized places of the New World had to be betterthan his misery on Chiriya.Bannon had walked into the house clenching the silver coin he had earned thatday, sure that it would finally be enough to buy passage for himself and hismother. They could run away together the next time a ship docked in port. Inorder to be sure, he intended to count the carefully saved coins he had hiddenin the bottom of the dirt-filled flowerpot on his windowsill. The pot held onlythe shriveled remnants of a cliff anemone that he had planted and nurtured, andthen watched die.Upon stepping into his cottage, though, Bannon had immediately smelled burnedfood, along with the coppery tang of blood. He stopped, on guard. Standing atthe hearth, his mother turned from the pot she was stirring, trying to force asmile, but her lips and the side of her face looked like a slab of raw liver.Her pretense that everything was fine failed miserably.He stared at her, feeling sick. “I should have been here to stop him.”“You could not have done anything.” His mother’s voice sounded hoarse andragged, no doubt from screaming and then sobbing. “I didn’t tell him where youhid it—I wouldn’t tell him.” She began to weep again, shaking her head. Sheslumped to the inlaid fieldstones on the hearth. “I wouldn’t tell him … but heknew anyway. He ransacked your room until he found the coins.”Feeling an acid sickness in his stomach, Bannon ran to his room and saw hismeager keepsakes scattered on the floor, the straw stuffing of his pallet tornout, the quilt his mother had sewn wadded against the wall—and the flowerpotwith the cliff anemone upended, the dirt poured all over his bedding.The coins were gone.“No!” he cried. That money should have been a new hope, a fresh life for themboth. Bannon had worked hard in the fields and saved a year to get enough forthem to leave Chiriya and get far away from that man.His father had not just stolen the coins, he had robbed Bannon and his mother oftheir future. “No!” he shouted again into the silent cottage as his mother wepton the hearth.And that was how his father had taught Bannon never to keep all of his coins inone place, because then someone could take everything. It didn’t matter how goodthe hiding place was, thieves like his father could be smart, thieves could bebrutal—or both. But when thieves found at least some money, then Bannon couldmake a convincing plea that it was all he had, and they might not think to lookelsewhere.…“By the good spirits, my boy!” The swordsmith’s voice cut through his dark hazeof memories. “You’re going to break my testing block, break that sword—and breakyour arm while you’re at it.”Bannon blinked and saw what he had done. In an unconscious frenzy, he hadchopped great gouges into the pine log, spraying splinters in all directions.His hands were sweaty, but they squeezed the leather-wrapped grip in astranglehold. The discolored blade thrummed in the air, but the sword wasundamaged, the edge not notched.His shoulders ached, his hands were sore, his wrists throbbed. “I think…” hesaid, then swallowed hard. “I think I’ve tested it enough. You’re right, sir. Itseems to be a good blade.”He reached into his pocket and pulled out the last copper coin. “One more thingfrom you, sir. Would a copper be enough for you to sharpen the sword again?” Helooked at the mangled practice block and suppressed a shiver. “I think it mighthave lost some of its edge.”Mandon looked long and hard at him, then accepted the copper coin. “I’ll put anedge on it that should last a long time, provided you take care of the blade.”“I will,” Bannon promised.The swordsmith used the grinding stone to resharpen the sword, throwing off aflurry of sparks. Bannon watched but didn’t see, as his thoughts wanderedthrough a quagmire of memories. Before long, he would have to get back to theWavewalker so he could be there when they sailed out on the evening tide. Therest of the crew would be hungover and miserable, and just as penniless as hewas. Bannon would fit right in.He fashioned a smile again and touched his bruised lip, then ignored thesoreness as he imagined everything he could do to the thugs if they everbothered him again. Now he was prepared. He dipped briefly into his fantasy—no,his belief—in a satisfying life, a happy family, kind friends. That world had toexist somewhere. Throughout his childhood on Chiriya, during all the times hisfather had shouted and struck, Bannon Farmer had built up that picture in hismind, and he desperately clung to it.By the time he had reconstructed the rosy image of how things should be, Mandonhad finished sharpening his blade and handed the weapon back to him. “I give youthis sword with my fervent wish that you never need to use it.”When Bannon smiled, this time he did feel the sting in his lip. “That is myhope, too. Always my hope.” But he doubted that would happen.Bidding Mandon farewell, he left the shop and made his way down to the docks andthe waiting Wavewalker."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 7 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch7]Nicci reached the docks in Grafan Harbor after making her way from the darklycluttered buildings to a more spacious district of merchants’ warehouses andadministrative offices. The harbormaster’s hall was a busy place, with thewindows and doors thrown wide open to let in the breezes. Clerks inhigh-collared jackets bustled along the docks with their papers and quills,interviewing ships’ quartermasters to inventory and tax the exotic and ordinarycargo.Dockside inns and taverns were adorned with garish signs and unappealing names.The Snout and Maggot was unusually busy, filled with people who conversed inshouts instead of normal voices. In front of the tavern, a pudgy boy offeredburned meat pies to sailors who lounged on the steps or leaned against theoutside wall.Servicing the steady flow of lonely men in port, rickety-looking brothels werecrowded so closely against one another that the patrons of one establishmentcould hear the lusty activities in the adjoining brothel. Wildly imaginativemurals painted on their exterior walls advertised improbable images of theservices their women or boys performed. As Nicci considered the murals, shedoubted many sailors could manage the intricate, overly flexible positions. Shebit her lower lip, where once a golden ring had marked her as Jagang’s property.From her unwelcome experience in the soldiers’ tents, she knew that while mostmen believed they had great prowess as lovers, they were usually just brutes whofinished quickly and without finesse.She walked past moneylender stalls, extravagant ones that financed whole sailingexpeditions, or smaller and more usurious moneylenders who preyed upon desperatesailors. A forlorn-looking man was locked in a pillory in front of onemoneylender’s shack. Slumped and scowling in the restraints, he had been peltedwith rotted fruit, and he sneered back as passersby jeered at him.Nicci knew how Tanimura worked. Some supposedly compassionate captain would paythe man’s obligation and take him aboard a ship as part of the indentured crew,but such “rescued” men were bound to such impossibly high interest rates thatthey were practically slaves. Although Nicci despised slavery, she also hadlittle sympathy for any fool who would create such a situation for himself.Walking along the waterfront, she assessed the ships tied up at the docks,keeping her eyes open for one named Wavewalker, which Bannon Farmer hadsuggested. Those vessels with large cargo holds were clearly trading ships,while narrower-beamed hulls and streamlined construction signified fast patrolships or warships.Groups of hairy, muscular men offered their services as porters like human oxenhauling cargo to where shouting merchants held auctions. Laborers pulled thickhemp ropes through squeaking pulleys to raise crates and pallets off the decks.At one smoke- and grease-stained cargo vessel, the sailors struggled with ablock and tackle to lift the severed tentacle of a huge sea creature. Theleathery gray skin was covered with slime and adorned with suckers. The heavingworkers swung the flopping appendage over the side, and it landed with a thudand a splat onto the dock. Butchers swept in, using saws and cleavers to chopthe tentacle meat into smaller steaks, while young apprentices ran up and downthe docks calling out, “Fresh kraken meat! Fresh kraken meat for sale!” Thesmell was so foul and fishy, Nicci couldn’t imagine anyone willingly eating thestuff.She was startled to hear Nathan’s voice call to her. “There you are, Sorceress.I am ready to help you find us a ship to carry us on our grand expedition to theOld World.”When Nicci turned to look at the wizard, she nearly laughed at his appearance.Upon leaving the People’s Palace, Nathan had worn fine traveling clothes, butduring their journey through the Dark Lands and then down to Tanimura, hisgarments had grown bedraggled, the fabric faded, the cloth frayed around thecuffs, the hem of his cape tattered. Now he sported new brown leather trousersand a white linen shirt with fresh starched ruffles down the front, voluminoussleeves, and wide folded cuffs, each fastened with a golden link. He wore anopen embroidered vest, a fine forest-green cape. He also carried a boundsatchel, which no doubt held other shirts—probably another few impractical whiteones that would become stained and dingy in no time at all—as well as vests,trousers, maybe even a second cape, as if he needed one.Nathan seemed to interpret her expression as admiration. “Hmm, I may have toreassess my opinion of Tanimura. It is a marvelous city after all, despite mypast unpleasantness here. An entire district devoted to nothing but tailors!Shirt makers, jacket makers, trouser makers, cloak makers. The selection isextraordinary!” He lowered his voice to a husky whisper. “Would you believe Ifound two alleys devoted to highly creative smallclothes for women?” He cockedan eyebrow, and Nicci knew he did it just to annoy her. “I could take you there,Sorceress.”“I think not,” she said. “My black dress and my other travel garments are quiteadequate, and I am traveling in service of Richard.” She had no interest inobtaining lacy smallclothes to entice some unknown man. Nicci had never neededlace, if that was what she’d been after.Nathan continued with his unflappable exuberance. “And cobblers specializing inall types of boots.” He tapped the toe of his new black boot on the dock boards,adjusting the fit. “Belt makers, button carvers, bucklesmiths—did you know thatwas a profession? Bucklesmiths!”Nicci could imagine him walking among the shops, fascinated by so many choices,like a child overwhelmed by a sweet shop. “I am surprised you made up your mindso quickly.”“Indeed! After I first escaped from the Palace of the Prophets, Clarissa and Iwent to a tailor outside of Tanimura, and he took some time to complete the jobto my satisfaction. Very meticulous.” A wistful flicker of memory crossed hisface. “But here in the city, with such extraordinary selection, I merely neededto name the clothes I wanted, and some tailor would find the items, exactly inmy size.” He made a quick, satisfied sound in his throat, hefting his packs. “Ibought several outfits.”He looked along the docks, scanned the numerous ships tied up in the harbor.“So, I am ready to depart. Have you found us passage?”Nicci thought of the young man in the alley. “I’m looking for a ship called theWavewalker, a three-masted carrack due to depart tonight, sailing south. It maybe what we need.”“Follow me,” Nathan said. “The Wavewalker is this way.”She didn’t ask how the wizard could know such a thing or how long he had beenexploring the harbor without her. Together, they walked along the pier and foundthe Wavewalker tied up to the third dock from the end. The ship’s figureheadshowed the face of a beautiful woman with curly tresses that flowed back,transforming into ocean waves—the Sea Mother, a superstition from the southerncoastal towns of the Old World.The last carts and barrels of supplies were being loaded on board the Wavewalkerfor departure with the outgoing tide that night. Sailors carried cages ofchickens onto the deck, and the potbellied ship’s cook led a forlorn-lookingmilk cow by a rope up the boarding ramp.Sailors gathered at the rails, watching the activity on the docks, many of themlooking miserable from hangovers or bruised from brawls. No doubt they had spentor lost all their money and had returned early to the ship, having no place elseto go.Nicci and Nathan walked up the ramp, carrying their packs. The wizard waved atan older man in a gray captain’s jacket, who rose from a wooden stool on thedeck. The captain looked perfectly comfortable on board, liking his own shipbetter than the amenities in Tanimura. From the corner of his mouth, he removeda long-stemmed pipe from which wafted a curl of greenish-blue smoke, pungentwith the smell of dream weed.“Are you Captain Eli?” Nicci asked.The man raised his bushy eyebrows and bowed, meeting them as they came aboard.“Eli Corwin, ma’am. How is it that you’re familiar with who I am?”“One of your sailors recommended that we speak to you about booking passagesouth to the Old World. We wish to depart soon.”Captain Eli removed his flat, gray cap. He had thick, wiry black hair shotthrough with silver strands. A dark boundary of beard outlined his jaw, but therest of his face was clean shaven. “If departing tonight is soon enough, thenthis is your ship. The Wavewalker is a cargo vessel, but we have room for a fewpassengers, provided the fee is adequate.”“We have more than a fee.” When Nathan puffed his chest with pride, his fancynew shirt swelled, as if the ruffles were flowers blooming. From the leather bagat his side, he removed a document and extended it to the captain. “This is awrit from Lord Rahl, master of D’Hara, appointing me his roving ambassador. Theprotection and status also covers my traveling companion.”Captain Eli skimmed the writ so quickly that Nicci knew he wasn’t actuallyreading the words. He did not seem impressed. “This writ and the price of apassage will be enough to pay for your passage.”Nicci felt heat rise to her cheeks. “Lord Rahl’s writ should guarantee us freepassage.”“Maybe it should.” The captain put the cap back on his head and inserted thepipe between his lips. He inhaled a long slow breath, then exhaled. “But suchdocuments could be forged. There are many tricksters out to cheat an honestcaptain.” He sucked again on his pipe. “Surely a powerful man like Lord Rahl,master of D’Hara, has a treasury large enough not to begrudge me the price ofyour passage.”He gestured toward the adjacent ship, where men in exotic silk pantaloonsunloaded crates of spiny fruit. “For most of the captains here, a letter from aruler they’ve never heard of will gain you nothing. For me, I’ll try to befair.”The cow let out a low moan as the cook tried to wrestle it down a ramp to alower deck.“Informing the world about Lord Rahl’s rule is part of our mission,” Nicci said.She still placed little credence in the other quest that the witch woman claimedwas so important.Captain Eli returned to his seat on the stool. “And you are welcome to tellevery member of my crew about your Lord Rahl’s wonderful new empire—so long asyou pay for your cabins.”Nicci stiffened, preparing to demand that the captain acquiesce, but Nathanstepped forward. “That seems eminently reasonable, Captain. You’re abusinessman, and we can be fair.” He plucked open the bindings of a small pouchin his palm and dumped gold pieces into the captain’s outstretched hand.Surprised, the man looked at the coins, warred with his decision, and thenhanded two gold pieces back to Nathan. “This is enough, thank you.”When the captain secured the coins in his own purse, Nathan whispered to Nicci,“We can always make more. Why not keep everyone happy?”Rather than carrying huge sacks of coins from the D’Haran treasury, Nathan usedhis magic to transmute common metals into gold, so they never worried abouthaving whatever money they needed. The wild people in the Dark Lands had no usefor currency, but here in the civilized towns of D’Hara, Nathan found it usefulto carry a fair amount of gold.“For that price,” the wizard added, “my companion and I will each receive aprivate stateroom.”The captain chuckled good-naturedly. “A stateroom? I see you’ve never beenaboard the Wavewalker. In fact, I wonder if you’ve ever been aboard a ship atall? Yes, I can find a cabin for each of you. Some highborn nobles mightconsider them closets, but each room has a door and a bunk. After a week or twoon the waves, you’ll think of them as fine accommodations.”As long as she got to her destination, Nicci didn’t care about spacious rooms orpadded furniture. “That will be acceptable.”Some of the crewmen lounged on the deck, assessing the new passengers as if theywere some strange fish they had drawn up in a net. Since the ship was due todepart soon, a stream of sailors continued to return, some staggering withhangovers, some carrying possessions they had purchased in port. They glanced atNathan with a curious expression, no doubt wondering about his remarkableclothes and his fine sword, but their eyes lingered on Nicci, drawn to her longblond hair and the black dress that accentuated her curves. Nicci saw no sign ofthe young man she had rescued in the alley.Dismissing the scrutiny of the sailors, the captain directed the two guests totheir cabins. As she crossed the deck, Nicci noticed five shirtless men whosebroad chests sported a waving line of tattooed circles. All five had dusky skinand mud-brown hair pulled back and tied like the tail of a warhorse. Althoughmost of the crewmen turned their gazes away from Nicci’s stare, these haughtyshirtless men stared at her with undisguised hunger.Seeing their lascivious grins, Nathan stepped in front of Nicci. “Make way!Don’t you know this is Death’s Mistress?” The shirtless men grudgingly backedoff.Their cabins in the stern of the ship proved to be just as small andunimpressive as Captain Eli had led them to expect. Nicci could tell that Nathanwas disappointed in the accommodations, and she said, “Even a small cabin isbetter than lying on the forest floor in the cold rain and fog of the DarkLands.”“You are ever the optimist, Sorceress,” he said. “I concur.”For now, as the sun set over the delta of the Kern River and the tide began togo out, they went back up on deck to watch the preparations for departure.Captain Eli shouted orders as his crew climbed the masts and crawled out onyardarms to unfurl sails. Others slipped thick hawsers from dock posts andloosed the ropes from stanchions on the pier. Hour bells rang from towers alongthe harbor.She still had not seen Bannon Farmer aboard, and she feared the young redheadhad blundered into another group of cutthroats in an alley and had suffered thefate she expected him to.Just as the sailors prepared to lift the Wavewalker’s boarding ramp, though, ayoung man with long ginger hair bounded down the dock. “Wait for me, I’m coming!Wait! Wavewalker, wait!” Nicci noticed that he was now carrying a sword, whichbounced and slapped against his thigh as he ran.Bannon raced along as merchants and dockworkers scattered out of the way. Hebumped into a reeling, drunken sailor who couldn’t seem to remember where hisown ship was, but Bannon spun past him and ran up the boarding ramp. His fellowsailors laughed, and a few exchanged coins. “I told you he’d be too foolish tojump ship when he had the chance.”Captain Eli gave Bannon a scolding look. “Some of our crew were betting you’d bea one-voyage sailor, Mr. Farmer. Next time don’t be late.”“I wasn’t late, sir.” Bannon panted hard, swiping his loose hair out of hiseyes. His cheeks were flushed with the effort. “I’m just in time.”When Bannon noticed Nicci, his face brightened, and the broad grin onlyemphasized the growing bruise on his smashed lips. “You’re here! You came.Welcome aboard the Wavewalker.”“It seems we will be passengers. This ship is going where we need to travel.”She took a breath, then added, “Thank you for the recommendation.”He held up his plain, unadorned sword. “See, I found a blade. Just like I said.”The other sailors joked. One said, “Some might call that a sword—I’d call it agrass cutter.” Another said, “Who do you intend to impress with that ugly thing?A blind woman? Or maybe a farmer who needs to chop down tall weeds.”They all guffawed.Bannon frowned at his clunky sword, then re-formed his expression into a cheerygrin. “A sword doesn’t have to be pretty to be effective at killing,” he said,repeating Nicci’s earlier words. “It’s a sturdy sword.” He held it up. “In fact,that’s what I will name it. Sturdy!”Captain Eli cut him off. “Enough showing off your sword, Mr. Farmer. Right now,I need your hands and your muscles on the rigging ropes. I want to be clear ofthe ships in the harbor and out in the open water before night falls.”Standing beside her at the starboard rail, Nathan mused, “Well, we are on ourway, Sorceress. To Kol Adair, wherever it is.” He gave her a wry grin. “I thinkI’m already starting to feel whole again.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 8 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch8]The sea was calm and dark, and the full moon rose like a bright torch as theWavewalker glided out of Grafan Harbor. The three-masted carrack cruised pastthe chain of islands that strung out past Halsband Island, which now held onlythe pulverized rubble of the Palace of the Prophets.After they had left the glowing lights of Tanimura, the night sky became a deepvelvet black. Nicci stood on deck and looked up, trying to find new patternsamong the bright stars that had shifted in the universe.The canvas sails strained tight, creamy white as the full moon shone on them.The ropes glistened with a thin film of night dew. The carved figurehead of theSea Mother stared forward with wooden eyes, as if watching out for hazardsahead.Bannon came up to her near the bow, smiling shyly. “I’m glad you decided to comewith us aboard the Wavewalker.”“And I am glad that you survived Tanimura.” Nicci couldn’t tell whether he hadlearned any wariness or common sense from his time in the city. “It has been aday full of surprises.”He still proudly clung to his new blade. “You were right about the sword, thatit needs to be serviceable, not pretty. And sturdy. It needs to be sturdy.” Heheld the weapon as if it had become his most prized possession, turning it backand forth as he watched the moonlight play along the discolored blade. He sweptit sideways in a practice stroke. “I can’t wait for a chance to use it.”“Do not be so eager for that, but be ready if need be.”“I will. Do you have a sword of your own?”“I don’t need one,” Nicci said.His expression fell as he was suddenly reminded of what she had done to thethugs in the alley. “No, I doubt you would. I saw you hurl that man and smashhis head against the wall. It cracked open like a rotten pumpkin! And that otherman … you turned his neck to jelly! I don’t even know what you did to the thirdone.” Bannon shook his head. His eyes were wide. “I was trying to fight him foryou, but he just … died.”“That is what happens when you stop a person’s heart.”“Sweet Sea Mother,” Bannon whispered. He brushed his hair back. “You saved mylife, no doubt about that, and you were right—I was too innocent. I should neverhave blundered into a situation like that. I expect the world to be a niceplace, but it’s darker than I think.”“It is,” Nicci said.“It’s darker than I want it to be.”Nicci wondered if the young man had stolen some of the captain’s dream weed.“Better to see the dangers in the world and be ready when someone inevitablyturns on you. It is a far preferable surprise to find that a person is kinderthan you think, than to discover he is secretly a traitor.”Troubled expressions circled the young man’s face like eddy currents. “I supposeyou’re right, and I want to thank you again. I owe you.” He fumbled in thepockets of his canvas trousers. “I brought you something. To show my gratitude.”Nicci frowned at him. “That is not necessary. I saved your life because I was inthe right place, and because I despise those who prey on the weak.” She had nointention of letting this young man fawn over her. “I do not want your gifts.”He withdrew a tiny fold of soft cloth that he held in the palm of his hand. “Butyou have to take it.”“It is not necessary,” Nicci repeated, in a harder voice this time.“I think it’s necessary.” Bannon sounded more determined. He set his sword asideawkwardly, squatted against the side wall of the ship, and opened the cloth toreveal a pearl the size of a grieving woman’s tear.“I do not want your gifts,” Nicci reiterated.Bannon refused to listen. “On Chiriya Island I was taught manners and gratitude.My parents wanted me to be polite to everyone and to meet my obligations. Youwere there when I needed you. You saved me, and you punished those evil men. Myfather said that if I was to be an upstanding man, I had to show gratitude. Itdoesn’t matter whether you expect anything in return. I am required to give itto you.”His breathing quickened as he extended the pearl. It seemed to be made of silverand ice. “This is a wishpearl, an advance on my wages. The captain says we’llhave plenty before the end of the voyage, but I wanted it now.” He noddedintently. “Right now it’s very rare, and I want to give it to you.”A sailor on watch strolled past. “Rare?” His voice had a mocking tone. “That’sjust a leftover. We unloaded two chests full of them in Tanimura—it’s howCaptain Eli paid for his whole voyage. Soon enough, we’ll fill more chests onour way down south.”Bannon whirled to face the eavesdropping sailor, clenching his hand tight overthe wishpearl. “I was having a private conversation.”“This is a ship, cabbage farmer! Think again if you expect privacy anywhere onboard.”Defensive, Bannon picked up his sword. “It’s worth something now, and it’s thelast wishpearl. I want to give it to the sorceress, and if you don’t treat herwell, she’ll crush your windpipe and stop your heart. I’ve seen it with my owneyes.”The sailor laughed again and strolled off.Though Nicci did not want the offering, she understood the complexities ofobligations. She had indeed saved him, although she had not set out to do so.“If you’ve learned your lesson and taught yourself not to become a victim,Bannon Farmer, then that is demonstration enough of your gratitude.”“Not enough for me,” Bannon insisted, and extended the wishpearl again. “Justtake it. Throw it overboard if you like, but I will have done what was right. Ifulfilled what I needed to do.”The pearl felt slippery and cold in her fingertips. She rolled it back and forthon her palm with a fingertip. “If I accept this pearl, what does it obligate meto do for you? What are you expecting?”Bannon flushed, deeply embarrassed. “Why, nothing! I would never ask … thatisn’t what I was thinking!”She hardened her voice. “As long as you’re clear on that.”“It’s a wishpearl. Don’t you know what a wishpearl is?”“I do not. Is there some significance other than being a pretty bauble?” Seeingthat she had hurt him, Nicci grudgingly softened her voice. “It is a beautifulpearl. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a finer one.”“It’s a wishpearl,” he repeated. “You should make a wish. It might be just alegend, but I’ve heard that wishpearls are concentrated dreams and you canunleash one if you wish on it.”“Who would believe such a thing?” Nicci asked.“Many people. That’s why the Wavewalker makes such a profit on each voyage.Captain Eli knows the location of a long line of special reefs. He harvestswishpearls and sells them in the port cities—at least that’s what the othersailors said.” He lowered his voice and ducked his chin. “This is still just myfirst voyage, you know.”Nicci held the wishpearl, thought of where they were going, of the mission thewitch woman had given to Nathan. No doubt it would be a long journey. She lookeddown at the icy silver sphere under the moonlight and said, “Very well, then Iwish this voyage will help us get to Kol Adair.” She closed her fingers aroundthe pearl and slipped it into a small pocket in her black dress."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 9 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch9]The Wavewalker headed south across open water, beyond sight of the coastline.Having spent so much time sitting alone in the Palace of the Prophets, Nathanwas accustomed to sedentary days, but at least now he was out in the fresh air,inhaling brisk breezes.In the distance, Tanimura was only a memory—a thousand years of memories, as faras he was concerned. Time to make new memories. Red possessed the life book ofhis past, but he had a new volume for a whole new set of adventures. Now,without the gift of prophecy, every twist and turn of the future was a surpriseto him. Exactly as it should be.The captain and his crew knew how to guide the ship even when the winds did notblow in a favorable direction. The well-practiced sailors understood theintricate puzzle of how the rigging and the sails worked together, furling andunfurling canvas to catch any wisp of wind. It was like magic to Nathan, eventhough there was no magic beyond a well-seasoned familiarity with the mysteriesof the sea.Most of the crew had been with Captain Eli on numerous voyages, and each sailorhad a job to do—except for the five shirtless, tattooed men who lay about anddid nothing. Watching their lazy behavior and attitude, Nathan lost respect forthem, and not simply because they leered so much at Nicci. They displayed nointerest in participating as members of the crew. He supposed the arrogant menmust have their purpose, or the captain wouldn’t tolerate them on board. Fornow, though, they were primarily useless.Bannon Farmer was the newest sailor on the Wavewalker and thus received theleast-pleasant chores, dumping out slops, pumping the bilge, scrubbing the deckwith a bucket of salt water and a stiff hand brush. But he performed thedrudgery with a strange cheer.Nathan watched the young man climb the ratlines and stand on the high platformto serve as a lookout, or crawl out on a yardarm to loose a sail. Once Bannonfinished his chores, he would sit next to the wizard in the lazy afternoons,asking questions. “Have you really lived a thousand years? What fascinatingthings you must have done!”Nathan patted the life book at his side. “I am more interested in what I haveyet to do.” He gave the thin redhead an encouraging smile. “But I’ll be happy totell you some of my stories, if you will tell me yours.”Bannon’s shoulders slumped. “I don’t have any stories to tell. Nothing’s everhappened to me.” Looking away, he rubbed the discolored bruises on his face.“Why do you think I ran away from Chiriya? I had a perfect life there, lovingparents, a warm home. But it was too quiet and calm for a man like me.” When heforced a smile, he winced from the scab on his still-healing split lip.“I planted the cabbage fields in spring, weeded the cabbage fields all summer,harvested the cabbage in fall, and helped my mother make pickled cabbage forwinter. There was no chance to have an adventure.” He lifted his chin. “Myfather was very sad to see me go, because he was so proud of me. Maybe somedayI’ll return as a wealthy and famous adventurer.”“Maybe.” Nathan detected something odd in the young man’s words.Bannon brought out his own sword as he sat on deck next to Nathan. Its steelwasn’t perfect, but the edge was sharp enough. “I still think Sturdy will serveme well.”Since the young man seemed to expect sage advice, Nathan decided to give it. “Ablade can only serve its wielder if he knows how to use it. You serve the swordjust as the sword serves you.” He withdrew his own blade from its scabbard toadmire the fine workings on the grip, the inlaid gold, the gleam of theexpensive steel. He had always felt that it made him look bold and gallant, aman to be reckoned with, a warrior as well as a wizard. Standing, he held theblade in front of him, watching the play of sunlight along its edge. He gave theyoung man a hard look. “Do you know how to use your sword, my boy?”“I know how to swing a blade,” Bannon said.“We’re not cutting cabbages. What if you were fighting against a bloodthirstywarrior from the Imperial Order? Or worse, one of the flesh-eating half men fromthe Dark Lands?”Bannon paled. “I’m sure I could take down at least five of them before theykilled me.”“Only five? So I would have to deal with the thousands that remained?” Nathanflexed his arms and bent his knees in his supple new travel pants. “Why don’t wepractice? I could use a good training partner. I’ll teach you a few moves, sothat if you ever find yourself facing a savage enemy horde, you could maybe killfifteen of them before they took you down.”Bannon grinned. “I’d like that.” A troubled expression crossed his face. “Well,I don’t mean I’d like being killed, but I would like to make a brave accountingof myself if I were ever in a great battle.”“Those fighting at your side would like you to make a brave accounting as well,my boy.” Nathan stroked his chin with his left hand. “I may be a thousand yearsold, but I’m relatively new at being an adventurer. A sword looks so … dashing,don’t you think?” He held up the point.“Your sword is fine, sir,” Bannon admitted. “But will a fine sword and a dashingappearance frighten away a horde of monsters?”“I suppose not,” Nathan said. “Maybe we both could use the practice.” He wrappedhis hands around the hilt and tried different stances. “Shall we learn together,Bannon Farmer?”Grinning, the young man lifted his sword and stepped back to crouch into afighting stance, or at least the best imitation of a fighting stance he couldmanage.When Nathan swung, Bannon slashed sideways to meet the blade, but Nathan had toadjust the sweep of his arc to insure that their swords met with a clang. Thenhe struck backward, hitting the young man’s blade as it came up in defense. In aflurry of attack, Bannon swung and chopped, flailing from side to side.The wizard scolded, “Are you a woodsman trying to clear a forest?”“I’m trying to slay a thousand enemy soldiers!”“An admirable goal. Now let’s try a combination of strokes and jabs anddeflections.”Bannon responded with another wild combination of slashes and counterslashes,which the wizard easily met, although he was by no means a master swordsmanhimself. In any confrontation, Nathan would always rely on magic as his firstline of attack rather than a sword, but to teach the cocky young man a lesson,he worked his way through Bannon’s defenses and smacked him on the bottom withthe flat of his blade.Stung, Bannon yelped, his face flushing so crimson that even his frecklesvanished. “You’ll pay for that, Wizard!”“Take my payment on credit,” Nathan said with a proud smirk. “It may be quitesome time before you can make me fulfill the debt.”Some of the other sailors observed, amused by the swordplay. They howled withlaughter. “Look at the cabbage farmer!” snorted Karl, a muscular veteran of manyvoyages, who considered it his duty to make sure Bannon was well initiated.“Indeed, look at him,” Nathan called back. “Soon enough you’ll be afraid ofhim.”Attacking again, Bannon released a bottled-up anger that startled Nathan, evenfrightened him. Ducking and defending himself, the wizard chided, “Show controlas well as enthusiasm, my boy. Now then, let’s do it slowly. Watch me. Match mystrokes.”The two practiced for an hour in the hot sun, sweating with exertion. AfterNathan had led him through several fluid but basic exercises, Bannon began togrow more confident with his weapon. He was bright-eyed and grinning as theypicked up speed. The ring of blades brought out most of the crew to watch.Finally panting with exhaustion, Nathan raised his hand to signal a halt. “Dearspirits, you’ve had as much instruction as you can handle for one day. I’dbetter give you time to absorb what you’ve learned.” He tried to control hisheavy breathing so Bannon would not notice how winded he was.The young man’s hair was damp with perspiration, but the sea breezes blew it inall directions. He showed no sign of being ready to give up.Nathan continued, “Maybe it’s time for me to tell stories and teach you a bitabout history. A good swordsman is also an intelligent swordsman.”Bannon kept his sword up. “But how will a story from history teach me to bebetter with my blade?”Nathan smiled back at him. “I could tell you the tale of a poorly skilledswordsman who had his head chopped off. Would that be a good enough objectlesson?”Bannon wiped his brow and sat on a mound of coiled rope. “Very well then, let’shear the tale.”* * *Nicci spent the day at the ship’s stern in Captain Eli’s large chart room on thepiloting deck. The captain had opened up twin windows at the rear to let infresh breezes. The view of the ocean behind them showed a curl of foamy wake asthe Wavewalker sailed along. The line of stirred water reminded Nicci of thebroad imperial roads that Jagang had built across the Old World, but whileJagang’s roads would endure for a long time, this watery path faded as soon asthe ship passed.“I would like to study your charts and maps,” she told the captain. “As anemissary for Lord Rahl, I must see the far reaches of the Old World, where theImperial Order conquered. That is all part of D’Hara now.”Captain Eli toyed with his long-stemmed pipe, tapping its bowl on the hard woodof a map table. “Many captains keep their routes confidential, since theswiftest passage means money for a trader. I once knew the currents and thereefs and the shoreline so very well.” He sucked on the end of his pipe, musingto himself, but he didn’t light it inside the chart room, lest a stray ash catchthe maps on fire. “But I suppose it doesn’t matter anymore.”“I am not your competition, Captain,” Nicci said. “I have no interest in a mapof the ocean. I want to know the coastline and the landscape inland. Mycompanion and I are searching for a place called Kol Adair.”“Never heard of it. Must be far inland, and any place away from shore doesn’thave much meaning for my life.” He scratched the side of his face. “But I didnot mean you were my competition. I meant that the current maps don’t matterbecause all is changed, you see. Everything’s different now.“In the last two months the currents have shifted. The wind patterns that I knewso well have now changed direction, as if the seasons are all mixed up.” He letout a long groan. “And the stars at night are in the wrong places. How am Isupposed to navigate? My astrolabes and sextants are useless. My constellationmaps don’t show the same stars. Sweet Sea Mother, I don’t even know if thecompass points true north anymore. I am making my way by instinct.”Nicci knew full well what had happened. “It is a new world, Captain. Prophecy isentirely gone. Magic has changed in ways that we haven’t begun to fathom.” Thenshe turned her bright blue gaze toward his, and drew a breath of the damp air asa breeze rippled the papers on the chart table. “But someone has to be the firstto make new star charts, the first to map out the changed currents, and thefirst to discover the best places to drop anchor. You can be one of thosefirsts, Captain.”“That would be a wonderful thing … if I fancied myself an explorer.” The captainscratched his trim of a beard around his jaw. “But my ambition has always beento serve as a successful cargo captain going from port to port. I have familiesto support, many children. I see little enough of them as it is, and I want tobe able to arrive on time.”“Families?” she asked. “More than one?”“Of course.” Captain Eli ran his fingers over his dark hair, tucking asilver-shot lock behind his ear. “I have a wife and two daughters in Tanimura, ayounger wife and three sons at Larrikan Shores, and a very beautiful one inSerrimundi, the daughter of the harborlord.”“Do they know about your other families?” Nicci asked. “Is this an unusualarrangement among sea captains?”“I take care of each one in turn, wherever I go. Every wife has a fine house.Each of my sons or daughters is comfortable, with food, shelter, and aneducation. Most sailors and captains would simply visit the brothels at everyport city, and I know of many a captain who caught a loathsome disease and gaveit to his wife when he came home.” Captain Eli stared out at the endless seabehind the stern. “No, that’s not for me. I have chosen my wives, and I amfaithful to them. I am an honorable man.”Considering the countless women Emperor Jagang had taken, including her, and howhe had thrown Nicci and others into the tents to be raped again and again by hissoldiers, she did not judge Captain Eli Corwin. She had never felt anyinclination to be a man’s wife, or one of his wives, except for the time she hadforced Richard Rahl to pretend to be her husband. Nicci had imagined a perfectdomestic existence, sure that she could convince him to adopt the philosophy ofthe Imperial Order. That had been not only a lie, but a bitter lie, and Richardhad hated her for it.Unconsciously, Nicci rubbed her lower lip, still imagining the long-healed scarthere from Jagang’s gold ring. Nicci had never realized that her sick dream offorcing Richard to be her husband was a delusion as foolish as Bannon Farmer’simagined perfect world.Fortunately, she was a different person now. After living secretly as a Sisterof the Dark for so many years, then being enslaved by Jagang, broken, thenrebuilt—but rebuilt wrong, until she was finally fixed by Richard—she understoodeverything better now. Nicci owed Richard more than she could ever repay. And hehad given her a mission.“Let me see your charts nevertheless,” she said, driving away the memories. “Themore I know about the Old World, the more I know for Lord Rahl’s sake.”Captain Eli spread the maps out before her on the table, sorting the broadpapers until he found one that showed the coastline far south of Tanimura.“These are our major stops. Lefton Harbor, Kherimus, Andaliyo, Larrikan Shores,even Serrimundi—we have a special agreement with the harborlord there, thanks tomy wife.” He smiled wistfully at the thought of her.Nicci ran her fingers to the edge of the map, seeing no sign of Kol Adair. “Andwhat is farther south? These charts are incomplete.”“No one goes farther south, no reason to go there. That’s the Phantom Coast.Barely settled, even though the imperial roads stretch far into that land.”Captain Eli sucked on his unlit pipe again, set it aside, and wiped his lips.“Who knows what the old emperors had in mind when they built those roads?”Nicci frowned at the cities marked on the maps. “I need to make sure thateveryone in the Old World knows about the end of war, the defeat of EmperorJagang. We’ll ask for your help as well, Captain. Even after we depart yourship, I will give you something in writing which you can take to these ports andhelp spread the message about Lord Rahl. All lands must be brought under onerule, even though each will keep its own culture and separate governance—so longas the people do not break the basic rules as determined by all.”“A fine sentiment,” the captain said, rolling up the maps, “if everyone felt thesame way. But I doubt you will get them to agree.”“That is the core of our quest. We’ll have to make them feel the same way,”Nicci said, and added a small, confident smile. “I can be very persuasive. Andif I’m not sufficient, then there’s a large D’Haran army to help make thepoint.”She and the captain left the chart room, stepping out onto the high deck fromwhich they could watch the sailors doing their daily chores. The five shirtlessmen lounged about, disdaining the work and the crew. They turned their arrogantgazes toward Nicci, and one called up to her, “Come to play with us? We’ve gottime.”“You can waste your own time until we reach the reefs,” said Captain Eli. “But Idon’t think the lady wants to play with you.”Nicci said in a hard voice, “I doubt they’d enjoy how I might play with them.”The shirtless layabouts responded with leering laughter, which annoyed Nicci.She turned to the captain. “Why don’t they work for their passage? They areworthless men.”“They are wishpearl divers. They’ve been with me for three voyages—extremelyprofitable voyages.” He nodded to them all. “Sol, Elgin, Rom, Pell, and Buna.They might be lazy louts now, but they will earn ten times their keep in oneday, once we reach the reefs.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 10 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch10]Seagulls wheeled overhead, following the Wavewalker under sunny skies.Fascinated, Nathan joined the sailors crowding the ship’s rails, excitedlypointing down at the strange drifting infestation that surrounded them on theopen seas.Hundreds of thousands of jellyfish floated on the surface like soap bubbles,each one as large as an ox’s head, throbbing like jellied brain tissue. Themindless translucent creatures posed no threat that Nathan could see as theWavewalker cruised along and nudged them aside. Some of the jellyfish splatteredagainst the hull boards and left a glutinous film, but the rest simply bobbedout of the way.Captain Eli stood on deck, cautious. “Steady onward. If it was a sea serpent ora kraken, I’d be worried, but those jellyfish are just a nuisance.”Bannon stared in wonder. He turned to his mentor, flushed. “I never saw thelikes of these on Chiriya, but other kinds of jellyfish would drift close toshore in the quiet coves … where a boy and his friend might go swimming. Theysting!” He let out a wistful sigh, dreaming of home. “Ian and I had our ownspecial lagoon where there were tide pools. The water was just right for wading,but we didn’t see the jellyfish. We both got terribly stung once. My leg swelledup like a week-old pig carcass, and Ian was even worse. We could barely walkhome. My father was angry because I couldn’t work in the cabbage fields for daysafterward.”The young man’s expression darkened, and then, like clouds parting, he smiledagain. “We all had a good laugh about it.” He blew air between his lips. “Andthose jellyfish were only the size of my fist.” He leaned far out over the sideto get a better look. “I’ll bet a sting from one of those things would killyou—probably five times over!”“Being killed once would be sufficient.” Nathan liked the young man. BannonFarmer seemed earnest and determined, perhaps a bit too innocent—but Nathandidn’t mind innocence. The wizard had written his own tales for young boys likeBannon, The Adventures of Bonnie Day and countless other stories carried far andwide on the mouths and lute strings of minstrels. Right now, Nathan saw noreason not to take the young man under his wing.Out in the open air, Nicci stood aloof, away from the sailors. Her thick blondhair blew in the breezes, and her blue eyes pierced the distance. Thetight-fitting black dress embraced her breasts and accentuated her curves.Cinched tight at the waist, the flowing skirt angled down to her right knee. Onboard, she’d decided to forgo her black travel leggings and high boots. Shelooked beautiful in the way a pristine work of art was beautiful, to be admiredand appreciated, but definitely not to be touched.Bannon occasionally looked at her with the wrong kind of sparkle in his eyes.Not lust, but infatuation. Nathan would have to watch that, lest it become aproblem later on. The young man had no idea what he would be getting into.Now, Bannon lowered his voice to an odd whisper as he asked Nathan, “Is it trueshe was really called Death’s Mistress?”Nathan smiled. “Dear boy, our Nicci was one of the most feared women in Jagang’sImperial Order. She has the blood of thousands on her hands.”“Thousands?” Bannon swallowed.The wizard waved his hand. “More like tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds ofthousands.” He nodded. “Yes. I would suppose that’s more accurate. Hundreds ofthousands.”Although Nicci stood presumably out of earshot, Nathan saw her lips quirk in athin smile. He continued in a stage whisper, “She was also a Sister of the Dark,served the Keeper for years before she served Jagang the dream walker.” Heglanced around, noting that some of the other sailors were listening as well,and they muttered uneasily. While Bannon seemed in awe of Nicci’s past, theothers were fearful and superstitious.Nathan didn’t mind. Fear generated respect. “But that was before Nicci joinedLord Rahl, saw the light, became one of the staunchest fighters for freedom. DidI tell you she stopped Richard’s heart and sent him to the underworld?”“She—she killed him?”“Only for a time. She sent him to the Keeper so he could rescue the spirit ofhis beloved Kahlan. But that’s another story.” He clapped the young man on theshoulder. “And on a long voyage, we’ll have plenty of time for tales. No need totell them all now.”The young man muttered in disappointment. “I’ve had a boring life, growing up asa farmboy on a sleepy island. No stories worth telling.”“You got stung by a jellyfish once,” Nathan pointed out. “You must have othertales.”The young man leaned back and pondered. Below in the water, the crowdedjellyfish bumped against one another with muffled slurping sounds.“Well, it might just have been my imagination,” Bannon said. “A person’sthoughts tend to run wild when drifting alone in a small boat in the fog.”Nathan laughed. “Dear spirits, boy! Imagination is a critical part of a story.Tell your tale.”Bannon pursed his lips. “Have you ever heard of the selka? A race that livesbeneath the sea and watches the activities of people above? They observe ourboats and ships from below, which are like wooden clouds floating high in theirsky.”“The selka?” Nathan frowned, drawing thumb and forefinger from his lips to hischin. “Sea people … ah yes. If memory serves—and my memory is as sharp as afinely honed dagger—the selka were created to be fighters in the ancient wizardwars. Humans altered by magic into another form, like the mriswith, or even thesliph. The selka were made to be an undersea army that could rise up and attackenemy ships.” He narrowed his eyes. “But they’re either extinct, or justlegends.”“I never heard that part of the story before,” Bannon said. “We just told talesabout them on Chiriya. Sometimes the selka grant wishes.”Nathan chuckled. “If I had a copper coin for every story about a mythicalcreature that grants wishes, I’d have so many coins that I could buy whatever Iliked and have no need for wishes.”“I … I don’t know about that either,” Bannon muttered. “It was just a story theytold in the village. And there are times when you just want something to believein.”Nathan nodded solemnly, sorry he had teased the young man. “I’ve felt the sameway myself.”Bannon stared out to sea, seeming not to notice the jellyfish anymore. Helowered his voice to a whisper. “Just as there are times when an unhappy personneeds to run away. I was foolish and young … too young to know that I wasfoolish.”Perhaps too young for that still, Nathan thought, but kept his words to himself.“I set off in a little fishing boat all alone, meaning to leave Chiriya forever.I didn’t have any friends on the island.”“What about Ian? The one who was also stung by a jellyfish.”“This was later. Ian was gone.” Bannon frowned. “I set off at dusk as the tidewent out, and I knew the full moon would light my way throughout the night. Ihoped to see the selka, but in my heart, I suspected they were just stories. I’dbeen told so many things that turned out to be untrue.” He looked sickened, butwith obvious effort he restored his expression to a happy grin. “There’s alwaysa chance, though. I rowed into the darkness as the stars came out overhead, andI kept rowing until my arms felt as if they would fall off. After that, I justdrifted in the open water. For about an hour I could see the dark line ofChiriya Island, with the lights of hearth fires and lamps from the shorelinevillages high above the beaches. Then they vanished into the distance, and Ikept on rowing.”“Where did you think you were going?” Nathan asked. “Just heading out into theopen sea?”Bannon shrugged. “I knew the Old World was out there, a continent filled withcities like Tanimura, Kherimus, Andaliyo—a whole continent! I figured if Isimply went far enough, I was bound to bump into shore sooner or later.” Heglanced away in embarrassment. “Growing up on an island did not give me a goodgrasp of large distances. I drifted all night, and when dawn came I saw onlywater—water in all directions. Like this.” He gestured over the side ofWavewalker.“I didn’t have a compass or nearly enough supplies. I drifted on the open seaall day long under the baking sun, and I began to grow deeply worried. The heatof the day burned and blistered my skin, but the next night seemed colder thanever. And by the third day, I ran out of water and most of my food. I felt likesuch a fool. I saw no sign of land, had no idea which direction the Old Worldlay, or even how to find Chiriya again.“I cried like a heartbroken child, and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I stood upin the wobbly fishing boat and shouted into the distance, hoping someone wouldhear. That made me feel even more foolish than crying.“That night the moon was still bright, but a thick blanket of fog settledin—although it wasn’t a blanket, it was cold and clammy. I shivered, moremiserable than ever. I couldn’t see anything around me—not that there wasanything to see. The moon was just a gauzy glow overhead.”His voice became a whisper. “On a foggy, silent night you can hear sounds fromfar away, and distances deceive you. I heard splashes that I thought weresharks, then it sounded like swimming … an eerie voice. I called out again forhelp. In my imagination I thought it might be the selka come to rescue me, butcommon sense told me it was just a distant whale, or even a sea serpent. Ishouted and shouted, but I heard no answer. Maybe my voice startled whatever itwas, and I listened to the silence, nothing but the lapping waves and anotherdistant splash, something that might have been laughter, a giggle … but thatcouldn’t be true.“I was so distraught, anxious, exhausted—not to mention hungry and thirsty—thatI eventually collapsed during the darkest part of the night and fell into a deepsleep.”Nathan smiled to encourage the young man. “You have the makings of astoryteller, my boy. You’ve got me intrigued. How did you ever get out of it?”“I don’t know,” Bannon said. “I honestly don’t know.”Nathan frowned. “Then you have to work on a better ending for your story.”“Oh, there’s a good ending, sir. I woke up the next morning, and instead of thesilence of the endless waves, I heard the rush of water against a shore, surfriding up on the shingle. I realized that my boat wasn’t rocking anymore. Istood up and nearly fell out. I had washed up on the shore of an island, a placeI recognized! This was Chiriya, the same cove where Ian and I used to swim.”“How did you get back there?”The young man shrugged. “Sweet Sea Mother, I told you—I don’t know. Sometimeduring the night when I was unconscious from exhaustion, something had taken meback to our island, brought me safely to shore.”“Are you sure the currents didn’t just circle you around to your starting point?In the fog, how would you ever know?” Nathan looked down his nose. “You’re notsaying it was the selka who rescued you?”Bannon seemed embarrassed. “I’m saying that I found myself safely back on shore,where I had started from, and I don’t know how. In all the vast ocean and allthe islands in the sea, I had come back to the very place I called my home, thecove where I’d started from.” He paused for a long moment, then looked at thewizard and smiled in wonder. “And in the soft dirt of the shore, beside myboat—which had been dragged much farther up out of the water than even a hightide would have left it—I saw a footprint.”“What kind of footprint?”“It looked human … almost. But the toes were webbed, like a sea creature’s. Isaw the faint impression of what looked like a fin’s edge and sharp points likeclaws, instead of human toenails.”Nathan chuckled. “A fine story that is! And you said nothing had ever happenedto you.”“I suppose.…” Bannon did not sound convinced.The jellyfish swarm showed no sign of abating. Egged on by his crewmates, thebroad-shouldered Karl picked up a barb-tipped harpoon and tied a rope throughthe metal eye on the tail end of the shaft. As the others cheered and hooted,the veteran sailor leaned over the side and tossed the harpoon down to pop oneof the jellyfish like a large ripe blister. The iron point pierced the membrane,bursting the gelatinous creature into a smoking puddle. As the residue driftedout among the other jellyfish, its companions scooted away from the remains likefleeing robber bugs.With guffaws of laughter, the other sailors ran to get more harpoons, but whenKarl pulled the harpoon back up by the rope, he grunted in amazement. “Look!Look at this.” The sharpened iron tip was smoking, and it began to droop as acidpitted and ate away the metal.The other sailors stopped, poised to throw their harpoons as part of the game topop the jellyfish. Curious, Karl extended a callused finger, but before he couldtouch the smoking iron tip, Nathan barked a warning. “Leave that alone, or youmight lose a hand as well as a harpoon tip.”Captain Eli scolded them all. “I told you to leave those jellyfish be! The seahas enough dangers for us. We don’t need to make any more.”With a clatter, the other sailors lowered their harpoons, then sheepishly stowedthem away."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 11 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch11]The Wavewalker sailed south for a full week. Captain Eli bypassed the largercoastal cities in the Old World, and Nicci was concerned about the changedcurrents, altered wind patterns, and unreliable stars in the night sky. “Are welost?” she asked, standing next to the captain at the bow one afternoon.“Lady Sorceress, I know exactly where I’m sailing.” He wiped the thin end of hispipe between thumb and forefinger, then inserted it back into his mouth. “We areheading straight for the reefs.”Overhearing, Nathan stepped up to them. “That sounds ominous.”Pushed along by a steady sea wind, the Wavewalker moved at a fast clip. Thecaptain gazed ahead. “Not if you know where you’re going.”“And how can you be sure? You claimed the charts and currents were no longeraccurate,” Nicci said.“They aren’t, but I’m a captain, and the salt water of the sea runs through myveins. I can feel it in my senses. But before I can trade in Serrimundi orLefton Harbor, I need to take on my most valuable cargo. Tomorrow morning,you’ll see what I mean.”Captain Eli was right.Taking his shift on the lookout platform high on the mainmast, Bannon calledout, “A line of foam due south, Captain! Looks like rough water.”The captain leaned closer to the carved figurehead of the Sea Mother, shadinghis eyes. “That’ll be the reefs.”Nicci watched the shirtless wishpearl divers rouse themselves, as if awakeningfrom a long sleep. “Our services are required,” said the one named Sol, whoseemed to be their leader.Elgin stretched lazily. “I’ll get the ropes and the weights.”The other three, Pell, Buna, and, Rom, began breathing deeply, inhaling,exhaling, stretching their shoulders, loosening their arms. Given the size oftheir chests, and their commensurate lungs, Nicci guessed these divers might beable to stay underwater for some time.Buna narrowed his eyes at Nicci. “After a good day’s haul of wishpearls, maybewe’ll all get to have our wish with the lady.”With a huff, Nathan took insult at the comment, but Nicci answered calmly, “If Iget my wish, you won’t be physically capable of thinking such thoughts everagain.”* * *Even without charts, Captain Eli guided the Wavewalker through the choppy water,dodging dark barriers of exposed reefs, but the ship had room to maneuver in thedeep channels. The crewmen tied up the sails, rolling the canvas against theyardarms and lashing it tight. When the ship slowly drifted into position, theydropped anchor in a calm sheltered area, while the waves continued to break andfoam along the outer lines of submerged coral.Once the ship was safely anchored, the eager sailors watched the five wishpearldivers make their preparations. Sol barked orders to his comrades. “We go downtwo at a time. I dive first with Elgin, second will be Rom and Pell. After theycome up, I’ll be rested enough to go down with Buna.” He flexed his arms back todisplay his broad pectorals marked with a chain of tattooed circles.The divers opened a clay pot of grease, which they smeared over their skin. Thegrease would keep them warm as they went deep into the intricate coves andcrannies of the reef. The grease also made them slide through the water,according to Rom, who smeared an extra layer across his chest.Although the five divers had similar lines of circular tattoos, some sportedmore circles than others. Nicci learned that the tattoos were a tally of howmany chests of wishpearls each diver had collected. Sol had been down so manytimes, he had started a second line on the right side of his chest. They eachwore a braided belt from which dangled long, curved hooks to hang iron weightson, as well as a mesh sack for harvesting shells while they were underwater.As the first divers, Sol and Elgin each tied one end of a long hemp rope to thebelt around his waist and secured the other end to the foremast. Then theyclimbed up onto the rail, poised on callused bare feet. They fastened ironweights to the hooks on their belts, which would drag them down to the bottom sothey wouldn’t waste time or breath stroking down to their destination. Once deepamong the reefs, they could easily unhook and discard the weights beforeswimming back up.As the two divers stood balanced in the sunlight, they inhaled, exhaled, thensucked in another great breath, expanding their chests and filling their lungs.With unspoken synchronization, the pair dove over the side and vanished withbarely a ripple. The rope reeled out as they sank.Captain Eli scratched the line of beard on his jaw. He seemed very calm andsatisfied. “We might stay here at anchor a day or two. Depends on how long ittakes to fill up our cargo chest.”“A chest holds a lot of wishpearls,” Nathan observed.“Yes, it does.” The captain took off his cap and wiped his hair, then settled itback in place.After some minutes had passed, Bannon looked over the side, watching for the twodivers to return. He glanced at Rom and Pell, who were fixing belts to theirwaists, attaching iron weights to the hooks, and securing their mesh sacks asthey prepared to make their own dive as soon as the first pair surfaced.Bannon asked the two men, “Do you think I could be a wishpearl diver someday?”Rom looked at him as if he were an insect. “No.”The young man’s expression fell, but he continued to peer over the side. “Herethey come!”The divers burst to the surface. Gasping, they shook their heads, flinging waterfrom their long, clumpy hair. It had been nearly ten minutes, and Nicci wasamazed the men were able to stay underwater for that long. Their lung capacitywas as great as their arrogance.Each man grabbed one of the dangling ropes and scampered up the hull boards.After they swung themselves over the rail to stand dripping on the deck, Sol andElgin emptied their sacks, spilling out dozens of lumpy gray shells, which wereeerily shaped like hands folded in prayer.“Sweet Sea Mother, that’s lovely,” said Captain Eli as the crew rushed forward.“Absolutely lovely.”The Wavewalker’s crew set to work with stubby flat knives to split open the wetshells, tear out the rubbery flesh, and pluck out icy-silver pearls.Next, Rom and Pell dove overboard while their comrades rested. Sol spread hislips in a grin for Nicci. “If you offer me a proper reward, I’ll give you yourvery own wishpearl.”Nicci simply said, “I already have one. Bannon gave it to me.” Sol respondedonly with an annoyed grunt.By the time Rom and Pell swam back to the surface with an equally successfulharvest, the next two divers were ready. For hours, the bare-chested men wentdown and came up again, over and over, as the crew shucked the shells andremoved the pearls.Curious, Nathan picked up one of the split-open shells discarded on the deck.“Remarkable. They look like human hands cradling the pearls.”“Hands folded to make a wish,” Bannon said.To Nicci, the crudely formed fingers appeared to be holding tight to thetreasure hidden inside.“These reefs are lush with shells,” said Buna after his third dive. “There’senough treasure for a hundred trips.”“And we’ll keep coming back,” Captain Eli promised.Because the Wavewalker’s crew took some of their pay in wishpearls, they pressedthe divers to descend over and over again. Nicci was just glad to see thearrogant layabouts actually working.But at the end of the day, with the sun setting in a blaze of orange and goldenfire, the five divers were weary. Although Sol, Elgin, and Rom did not seeminclined to do extra work, Pell and Buna agreed to make one last dive. The twotied ropes around their waists, attached iron weights to the hooks, and jumpedoverboard.The sailors sat around on deck, chatting, shucking wishpearl shells, and pilingthe discards against the side wall. Pell and Buna stayed down for a longperiod—longer than any other previous dive that day. Nathan paced the deck,wearing an increasingly concerned look. The captain also looked worried.Finally, Sol frowned, went to the rail, and leaned over to peer into thedarkening water. “Pull on the ropes—haul them back up.” He clasped one of thewet hemp cables and strained, while an eager Bannon took the other rope tied tothe second diver.Bannon’s rope went taut in his hands, then suddenly yanked downward, tightening,burning through his fingers. He cried out and let go as the cable smackedagainst the Wavewalker’s hull. Something dragged it down from below.“No swimmer could possibly pull that hard!” Sol said, straining against therope.The second rope creaked as an unseen force deep below dragged back. Rom andElgin rushed to help haul on the ropes to bring their comrades back up. Thestrange grip tugged back with such strength that the whole ship began to tilt.They all strained together, shouting, heaving. “Pull them up!” Sol yelled again.Suddenly, both ropes snapped and hung loose in the water, like drifting seaweed.Working hand over hand, the men furiously pulled the ropes until the frayed endof the first one came free. “Why would they cut their own ropes?” Elgindemanded.Bannon stared at the torn, stubby end. “That’s frayed, not cut.”Nicci immediately understood the significance. “Something tore the rope apart.”As the would-be rescuers hauled up the second loose rope, Rom climbed on therail, ready to dive overboard to rescue his comrades, but before he could jump,the end of the second rope came dripping out of the water, still tied to thewoven belt that had been ripped free from the wishpearl diver. Tangled in thebelt were flaccid, wet loops of torn intestine and three connected vertebrae, asif an attacker had simply ripped the belt entirely through the diver’s spine andabdomen.The sailors howled in fear, backing away.“But how—?” Rom staggered backward, falling onto the deck. “We didn’t seeanything down there.”“Something killed Pell and Buna,” Sol said. “What could have caused this? Whatattacked them?”Elgin glared over at Nicci. “Maybe Death’s Mistress summoned a monster.”The three surviving divers stared at the sorceress in horror and fear, whichquickly turned to obvious hatred.Bannon whispered to Nicci in amazement, “Did you really do that? Just like youkilled the thieves in the alley?”She quietly chided him for his foolish statement, but after having seen thepotential violence in the wishpearl divers, she was glad that they feared her."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 12 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch12]The crew stared from the dissipating bloom of blood in the water to the shredsof flopping intestines that dangled from the loop of woven belt. Captain Elishouted for the sailors to set the sails and weigh anchor as clouds gathered inthe dusk. Although the Wavewalker was in warm latitudes, far to the south ofTanimura, the wind seemed to carry a chill of death.Nimble sailors scrambled out on the yardarms to untie the ropes, while otherspulled on the halyards and stretched the canvas. The ship moved away from thereefs, slinking like a whipped dog, while the navigator pushed hard on therudder and the lookouts guided the course to keep from scraping the dangerousrocks.The captain called in a hoarse voice, “We’ve already lost two men today. I donot wish to lose more.”Catching the wind, the ship retreated from the angry line of reefs and reachedopen water again. As full night fell, clouds obscured the stars, which matteredlittle since the captain could not navigate by the unfamiliar night sky anyway.He simply wanted to put distance between their ship and the reefs.Although the crew was superstitious about deadly sea monsters, Nicci simplyassumed that some shark or other aquatic predator had attacked Pell and Buna inthe reefs. Nevertheless, she remained alert for danger. An ominous moodsurrounded the crew like a cold and suffocating mist. After several hours, theblame the three surly wishpearl divers cast on Nicci took hold like an infectionamong the jittery sailors, and they all looked at her with fear. She did nothingto dispel their concerns. At least they left her alone.The Wavewalker sailed for three more days, and the weather worsened, like anoverripe fruit slowly spoiling. Troubled, the captain emerged from his chartroom to stare at the clotted gray skies and the uneasy froth-capped waves. Hespoke to Nicci as if she were his confidante. “With a full chest of wishpearlsharvested, this voyage has been very profitable, despite the cost in blood.Every captain knows he might lose a crewman or two, though I doubt those diverswill ever sail with me again.”Nicci gave the man a pragmatic look. “You’ll find others. Where are theytrained? One of the coastal cities? An island?”“Serrimundi. Wishpearl divers are revered among their people.”“I noticed the arrogance.”“It won’t be easy to replace them.” The captain sighed. “Those three will talkonce we get back to a port city.”“Then invest your new fortune wisely,” Nicci said. “Those pearls in your holdmay be the last you ever harvest.” The single pearl Bannon had given her wastucked away in a fold pocket of her black dress.When the watch changed, a lookout climbed down from the high platform, andanother scrambled up the ratlines to take his place. Nathan joined Nicci and thecaptain on the deck as the windblown, deeply tanned lookout approached. “Theclouds look angry, Captain. You can smell a storm on the wind.”Captain Eli nodded. “We may have to batten down for a rough night.”“Are there more reefs to worry about ahead?” Nathan asked. “Will we run aground?It would be much harder to find Kol Adair if we’re stranded out on a reefsomewhere.”“Yes, I’m sure it would be quite inconvenient all around.” The captain sucked onhis unlit pipe and pressed a hand on his cap to keep the wind from snatching itaway. “We are in open water. No reefs that I know of.” The sailor nodded andwent back to his duties.When the other man was gone, Nicci lowered her voice. “You said that your chartswere no longer accurate and you weren’t exactly sure where we were.”Captain Eli’s expression was distant. “True, but I don’t think reefs appear outof nowhere.”As the blustery wind increased, the anxious crew performed only the mostimportant chores. The potbellied cook came up with a bucket of frothy milk,fresh from the cow kept tied below. “She doesn’t like the rocking of the waves,”he said. “Next time the milk may be curdled when it comes out of her teats.”“Then we’ll have fresh cheese.” Captain Eli took a ladle of the proffered milk.Nicci declined, but the wizard was happy to taste it. He smacked his lips afterhe drank. The cook offered milk to the surly wishpearl divers, but they scowledat the bucket, focusing their glares on Nicci.“She might have poisoned it,” said Rom.Hearing this, Nicci decided to drink from the ladle after all.As the wind whistled through the rigging and the hours dragged on, Nathansuggested that he and Bannon practice their swordplay on deck. The clang ofsteel rang out in a flurry as the two pranced back and forth, dodging coiledropes and open rain barrels that had been set out to collect fresh water inanticipation of the imminent storm.Bannon had gotten noticeably better as a swordsman. He had a reckless energythat served to counteract his gracelessness, and Sturdy lived up to its name,receiving and deflecting blow after blow from Nathan’s much finer blade. For awhile, the performance distracted the uneasy crewmen from their gloom.By the time the young man and the wizard were both exhausted, the afternoonclouds were so thick with the oncoming storm that Nicci couldn’t even see thesunset on the open water. Instead, she merely watched the daylight die.“Will you show me some magic?” Bannon suggested to Nathan, climbing up on acrate that was too high to serve as a comfortable chair.“Why would I show you magic?” Nathan asked.“Because you’re a wizard, aren’t you? Wizards do magic tricks.”“Wizards use magic. Performing monkeys do tricks.” Nathan raised his thickeyebrows. “Ask the sorceress. Maybe she’ll perform a trick for you.”Bannon glanced over at Nicci, swallowed hard, then turned back. “I’ve alreadyseen her magic. I know what she can do.”“You know some of what I can do,” said Nicci.The carrack rocked back and forth in the rough seas, rising on the swells, thendropping into the troughs. Though most of the Wavewalker’s crew had ironstomachs, some sailors bent over the rail and retched into the open ocean. Themasts creaked and groaned; the sails rippled and flapped.Captain Eli stood with hands on hips and his woolen jacket secured with silverbuttons across his chest. “Trim the sails! The wind is getting stronger, and wedon’t need any torn canvas.”Above, the lookout had strapped himself to the mast to keep from being flungoverboard when the ship lurched.With an exaggerated sigh, Nathan acceded to Bannon’s request for a demonstrationof magic, even though the young man had not continued to pester him. “All right,watch this, my boy.” The wizard knelt down, smoothed the ruffles of his finetravel shirt, and briskly rubbed his palms together as if to warm them up. “Thisis just a small hand light, a flame we could use to ignite a fire or illuminateour way.”“I use sulfur matches, or flint and steel,” Bannon said.“Then you have magic of your own. You don’t need to see mine.”“No, I want to see it!” He leaned closer, his eyes bright. “Make fire. Show me.”Nathan cupped his hands to form a bowl. His brow wrinkled, and he stared intothe air, concentrating until a glimmer of light appeared. The wisp of flamecurled up and wavered, but when a gust of wind whipped across the deck, the handfire flickered, then went out. Nathan could not sustain it.The wizard looked completely baffled. Nicci had seen him create blazing balls offire before with barely a glance, not to mention far more horrific wizard’s firethat caused great destruction. As if incensed, he concentrated again, thenscowled when only a tiny thread of fire appeared, which was again extinguishedby the breezes.“Is it supposed to be that difficult?” Bannon asked.“I’m not feeling at all well, my boy,” he said, in an obvious, awkward excuse.“Magic requires concentration, and my mind is troubled. Besides, there’s toomuch wind for a proper demonstration.”Bannon looked disappointed. “I wasn’t aware that wizards could use magic onlyunder ideal conditions. You told me I had to be ready to fight with my sword, nomatter my mood.”“What do you know of wizards?” Nathan snapped. “Your sulfur matches couldn’tlight a fire in a situation like this either.”Stung, Bannon conceded.In a more apologetic voice, Nathan said, “It isn’t you, my boy. My Han seems tobe … troubled. I’m not entirely sure what to do about it.”“Your Han?”“It is what we call the force of magic, the force of life within us,particularly within a wizard. The Han manifests differently in different people.My Han was intertwined with prophecy as well as the ability to use magic, butnow that’s all untangled. I’m certain I’ll get it sorted out.”“Are you sure you’re not just seasick?” Bannon asked, with a teasing lilt in hisvoice.“Maybe that’s exactly it,” Nathan said.Disturbed by what she had seen, Nicci wondered what might be bothering thewizard. Nathan had lost his gift of prophecy with the shift in the world, buthis core magic should have remained unaffected. Still, a fire spell was supposedto be quite simple.“I’m retiring to my cabin.” Nathan turned away, trying to keep his dignity andbalance on the rocking deck. “If I am hungry, I may go to the galley for supperwhen it’s ready.”Nicci decided to take shelter in her own cabin as well. She didn’t want todistract the superstitious sailors by staying out in the worsening weather.* * *Despite the sorceress’s cold beauty, Sol had known that she was evil anddangerous from the moment he first saw her. His companions noticed only Nicci’sshapely figure, her long blond hair, and a face even more attractive thancarvings of the Sea Mother.When stuck alone on a ship, long at sea, sailors tended to lower their standardsof beauty, but there was no denying that this Death’s Mistress was morebeautiful than the most expensive whore in the cleanest brothel in Serrimundi.And Nicci was right here for the taking. Whenever the woman flaunted herself ondeck, her black dress clung to her curves and rippled around her in the breezes,tightening against her full breasts. Sol imagined the breasts would be soft andpliable, just waiting to be squeezed. He tried to picture her nipples, wonderingwhether they were dark or pale pink, whether she would gasp if he pinched them.The other two divers wanted to lay claim to her, but Sol was their leader, andhe would have to be first. Their two comrades were dead, and the survivorsdeserved something. The sorceress owed them all a few rounds of gasping,squirming pleasure. In fact, she owed them the lives of their murdered friends,Pell and Buna. She had somehow used her magic to summon underwater monsters tokill them. Nicci had taunted the divers for days, rebuffed their attentions,insulted them—and now two of his comrades were dead. It was her fault.Back home in Serrimundi, Sol and his fellow wishpearl divers were treated asheroes. From the time he was a young boy, his parents had taught him to divedeep, and then they had sold him to a mentor for a portion of Sol’s pearlharvest over the next five years. The mentor had trained him—and such trainingconsisted of him trying to drown young Sol over and over, tying heavy weights tohis ankles, sinking him to the bottom of a deep lagoon and counting out minutes.The mentor did not pull any of the apprentice divers back into blessed air untilhe decided they had been down there long enough. Over a third of the traineescame up dead, their lungs filled with water, their eyes bulging, their mouthsopen and slack.Sol himself had drowned once, but he had coughed up the water and come back tolife. That was when he knew he would be a wishpearl diver. He could have anySerrimundi woman he wanted, and he usually did. His lovers all expectedwishpearls as gifts, which he freely gave. Sol could always find more.Out in the southern reefs, the supply of folded-hand shells seemedinexhaustible, but Captain Corwin paid him in more than wishpearls. It was alucrative arrangement, giving Sol and his companions power and status wheneverthey returned to port.But Pell and Buna would not be coming back home. Because of Nicci. The aloofsorceress thought that she was untouchable, that she would not be held toaccount for killing his friends, but the Sea Mother demanded justice, and Solknew how to deliver it.After he whispered his plan to Elgin and Rom, the three met on deck where thesailors had piled discarded wishpearl shells. Most had already been thrownoverboard, but these last few remained, unnoticed after the disaster and therapid escape from the reefs.Now, the divers used their knives to pry loose the inedible and worthless meatinside, but Sol knew more about these particular shells. A gland inside theflesh of the shellfish contained a toxin—a poison potent enough to incapacitateeven a sorceress.The three men worked quickly to gather the extract, because the cook would soonbe preparing supper.* * *Bannon had first watch in the thickening night, and he was nervous. On Chiriyahe had seen many terrible storms roar across the ocean, hurricane-force windsthat whipped the flat island and tore the roofs off of houses. Fishing boats inthe coves had to be tied securely or dragged to safety up on the shore.He had never been through a storm at sea, but he could smell danger in the air.Sharp bursts of breezes tried to rip the breath from his lungs. He didn’t likethe look of the clouds or the feel of the winds.The off-duty sailors had gone belowdecks to play games in the lantern-lit gloom.Some men swung in their hammocks, trying to sleep as the Wavewalker lurched fromside to side; others puked into buckets, which they emptied out the open ports.Bannon was startled when three shapes loomed up beside him on the deck, lean menwho stood shirtless even in the blowing wind and pelting droplets of cold rain.Sol, the leader of the wishpearl divers, held a pot covered with a wooden lid.“The cook is finished serving supper.”Though he was queasy from the rocking deck, Bannon’s mouth watered. He hadn’teaten all day. “Is that for me?”Rom scowled at him. “No, you’ll get your own meal when your watch is over. Butthe cook wanted to make sure the sorceress ate.”Bannon frowned. “He’s never done that before.”“We’ve never had a storm like this before,” Elgin said. “Best for the twopassengers to stay in their cabins. If the fools walk around in the rain andwind, they might fall overboard, and the captain wants to be sure they pay him abonus when we get into port.”Bannon nodded. That made sense.“We already delivered a meal to the wizard, but the sorceress…” Sol looked away,as if in shame. “She knows we’ve been unkind to her, insulted her.” He thrustthe pot into Bannon’s hands. “Better if you deliver dinner personally.”Rom nodded. “Yes, it would be awkward if the three of us did it.”“Awkward,” Elgin agreed.Bannon was skeptical. He’d never seen the wishpearl divers run errands for thecook before. But most of the sailors were belowdecks, after all. And the diversrarely did any work, so he was glad to see them cooperate. Maybe the deaths oftheir comrades had given them a change of heart.Besides, Bannon was glad for the opportunity to bring Nicci her dinner. “I’lltake it,” he said."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 13 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch13]As the ship rocked in the sway of the increasing storm, Nicci looked at the potBannon had delivered to her cabin. She lifted the wooden lid and sniffed.“It’s fish chowder,” Bannon said, happy to be of service. He caught himselfagainst the door of her cabin as the ship lurched, but his smile didn’t fade.“The cook wanted to make sure you ate.”“I will eat.” Nicci had not intended to venture out into the wind-lashed nightto make her way to the galley. The young man was so eager, so solicitous; if shedid not accept the food, she knew he would only continue to pester her. “Thankyou.”“I’m on watch. I have to get back to my duties.” Bannon obviously wanted to chatwith her, hoping she would ask him to stay for a few more moments.“Yes, you have to get back to your duties.” Nicci took the pot in a swirl ofsavory, fishy aromas, and when the young man awkwardly retreated, she closed theflimsy cabin door.Her room had plank bulkheads, a washbasin, a narrow shuttered porthole, and atiny shelf. A hard narrow bunk with a woolen blanket served as her bed, and asmall oil lamp illuminated her quarters with a flickering flame.Sitting on the bunk, Nicci lifted the pot’s lid and used a splintered woodenspoon to stir the milky broth. Chunks of fish floated amid wilted herbs, gnarledtubers, and pieces of onion. She ate. The taste was sour, flavored withunfamiliar spices.When serving Emperor Jagang, Nicci had traveled the Old World, eaten manystrange cuisines, and sampled flavors that only a starving woman could enjoy.This stew was one of those, possibly because the milk had curdled in the broth.But she needed the nourishment. This was food, nothing more.The hull creaked and shifted as the ship felt the pressure of the waves and thebuilding wind. Finished with her meal, she turned the key in her oil lamp toretract the wick and extinguish the flame. In her cramped cabin she had only thedarkness and the sounds of a struggling ship for company.She lay back on her narrow bunk, trying to sleep, feeling her insides churn muchlike the waves outside. Before long, she wrapped the blanket around herself,shivering. The shivers became more violent. Her muscles clenched, her head beganto pound.Within an hour she knew that the chowder was poisoned. Not just spoiled, butcontaining some deadly substance. She should have known. She should have beenmore wary. Others had tried to kill her before, many others.But she found it incomprehensible that Bannon would poison her. No, she couldn’tbelieve it. The simple, eager young man was not a schemer, not a traitor. Shehad trusted the food because he had delivered it.But he could have been duped himself.Nicci curled up, panting hard, trying to squeeze out the fire in her gut. Sweatblossomed on her skin, and her shivers became so severe they were likeconvulsions. Her insides roiled as if someone had plunged a barbed spear intoher stomach and twirled it, twisting her intestines until she feared they mightbe torn out, like what remained of the wishpearl diver.Barely able to see or think, she slid off her bunk and swayed on weak legs. Herknees nearly buckled, but she clutched the joined planks of the bulkhead. Herhead spun. She retched, as if some invisible hand had reached down her throatand was trying to pull out her insides.Slumping against the wall of her cabin, Nicci was so unsteady that she barelynoticed the Wavewalker shuddering in the heavy seas. Her vision blurred, but thecabin was so dark she couldn’t see anyway. Her muscles felt like wet rags.Nicci needed to find help—needed to get to Nathan. She could think of no oneelse. Maybe the wizard would be able to purge the poison, heal any damage. Butshe couldn’t find the door. Her entire cabin was spinning.She retched again—this time vomiting all over the floor—but the poison hadalready set in. She tried to call upon enough of her own magic to strengthenherself, at least to get out of this trap, but she was too dizzy. Her thoughtsspun like a wheel edged with jagged razors.She had to get out, had to find her way onto the deck, where she hoped thefresh, cold air would revive her.She felt along the walls of her cabin, forced herself to focus, knowing shewould find the door if she just kept moving. How could she be lost in such acramped space? She encountered the small shelf and held on to it, placing somuch weight on it that the nails ripped loose from the planks and came crashingdown. She collapsed, and crawled across the deck, her hand slipping in the wetpool of her vomit. When she found her bunk again, Nicci was able to pull herselfto her feet. Finding the wall, she worked her way around the cabin, oneagonizing step at a time.The deck kept heaving, but she needed to find the way out. She knew it washere … somewhere close.Her cabin door burst open as someone pushed it inward. Nicci reeled back andbarely caught her balance as she saw three men crowded in the doorway. She knewthat Bannon was on watch, Nathan was in his cabin, and the rest of theWavewalker’s crew were huddled belowdecks, hiding from the storm.Nicci was here all alone.The three wishpearl divers faced her. Rom carried a small lamp turned down low,so they could make their way along the corridor. They were still shirtless, andthe unsteady lamplight cast dark shadows that chiseled their muscles. Theirloose trousers had been cinched tight around their waists—and in her distortedvision, Nicci saw that Sol was aroused, his manhood poking against the fabriclike a short, hard harpoon.She retreated a step deeper into her cabin. Her knees wobbled, and her weakhelplessness made Sol burst out in laughter. The other two divers joined him intheir husky chuckles. “The sorceress appears to be under the weather,” saidElgin, then snickered at his own joke.“She’ll be under me in a minute,” said Sol. He pushed his way into the cabinwith the other two close behind him. “You’ll be too sick to fight or use yourevil magic, bitch, and after we’re done with you, you’ll be too sore andexhausted to move.”“Go,” Nicci managed, and forced herself to add, “last chance.”“I get the first chance,” said Sol. “These two can take their turns afterward.”With a careless gesture, he knocked Nicci backward onto her bunk. The muscularman stood over her, slammed her shoulders down against the wadded blanket, andfumbled with her breasts. She pushed at his hands, tried to claw them. Eventhough she was sick and unable to find her magic, Nicci’s nails were sufficientweapons, and she ripped deep gouges in his forearm. Sol slapped her hard acrossthe face, and her head slammed against the pallet. Nicci reeled, but thephysical blow was no worse than what the poison was doing inside her.Sol managed to yank down the front of her dress to expose her breasts. “Bringthe lamp, Rom. I want to see these.”The three men leered down, laughing. Sol said, “Pink nipples, just like Ithought! It’s good to see for myself after dreaming about them for days.” He puta paw over her left breast, crushing down, squeezing hard.Nicci fought against the poison, delved deep into her mind, and struggled tofind her strength. She had been raped before, not just by Jagang, but countlesstimes by his soldiers when he had forced her to serve in their tents, to be atoy as punishment … as training. The powerful emperor had been able to forceher—but these worthless men were not dream walkers. They were not emperors. Theywere disgusting.Anger made Nicci’s blood burn. Whatever it was, the poison was just a chemical,and her magic was more potent than that. She was a Sister of the Dark. Shepossessed the abilities she had stolen from wizards she had killed. She couldsummon a ball of wizard’s fire and incinerate all three of these men, but thatmight also engulf the Wavewalker in fire.No, she had to fight them in a different way, a direct way. A more personal way.Grunting, Sol fumbled with the string on his trousers, loosening the fabric athis waist. He pulled his pants loose to expose his meaty shaft.“For all your bluster,” Nicci managed to say, “I expected something larger.”Elgin and Rom cackled. Sol slapped her again, then grabbed her thighs, pushingher legs apart.It had happened so many times before. She had been powerless. She had beenforced to endure.But Nicci didn’t have to endure now. Even weak, even poisoned, she was strongerthan these scum. She was better than they were. She felt flickers of fire withinher hands, not much more than the little flame Nathan had summoned on the windydeck. But it was enough.She clapped her burning hands against Sol’s naked shoulders, searing his skin.He howled and lurched back. Nicci released more magic into the fire in herpalms, but it flickered and weakened.The wishpearl divers backed away in fear. “She still has her magic.”“Not enough of it,” Sol growled and came back at her.Normally, calling fire was not difficult, but she had seen Nathan struggle withhis powers, too. Still, she knew even more straightforward spells. She couldmove the air, stir currents, create breezes. Now, she summoned air in theconfined cabin, not just as wind, but as a fist.The invisible blow shoved Sol away from her, and he was so startled that hiserection drooped. The other two men were still stiff, bulges poking prominentlyagainst the fabric of their pants, though the arousal probably stemmed as muchfrom the promise of violence as from the anticipation of physical pleasure.Sol recovered himself. “Bitch, you’ll lie back and—”Nicci ignored the poison, ignored the dizziness, ignored the sickness ragingthrough her. She called on the air again, focused it, pushed it, forming aweapon.The storm outside blew with greater fury, and winds lashed against theWavewalker. Sizzling, splattering rain came down so loud outside that no onecould hear her struggles inside the cabin. But if she made these men screamloudly enough, someone would hear.Nicci manipulated the air, shaping it like a hand … and then a fist. She used itto clutch the testicles between Sol’s legs.He cried out in sudden alarm.Nicci created two more hands of air that seized the sacs of the other twowishpearl divers. They cried out, flailing their hands against the invisiblegrip.“I warned you.” She rose up from the pallet, not caring that her breasts werestill exposed, and she glared at the three with her blue eyes. “I warned you—nowchoose. Do you want them torn off, or just crushed?”His face a mask of red fury, Sol lunged toward her. Nicci manipulated the air totighten her hold around his scrotum, and then twisted as if she were wrenchingoff the lid of a jar. She contracted her air fist with sudden force—but not soswiftly that she couldn’t feel each of his testicles squeeze until it poppedlike a rotten grape. Sol let out a high wail that could not begin to express hispain.Giving the men no chance to beg, because she had no interest in mercy, Niccicrushed the testicles of the other two, leaving them moaning, whimpering, andunable to manage much of a scream as they fell to the floor of her cabin.“I think you would rather I killed you.” Nicci pulled the front of her dressback up to cover herself. “I can always change my mind and come back.” Standingstraight on her wobbly legs, she glared down at the writhing men. “Evenpoisoned, I’m better than you.”She didn’t have time to clean up the garbage, though, before the main attackstruck the ship."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 14 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch14]The air-breathing thieves drifted overhead in their great ship, vulnerable atthe boundary between the water-home and the sky. The dark hulk cut across thewaves high above, aloof but not unreachable. The interface was choppy andstirred, indicating a turbulent storm on the surface. The fragile creatures upthere would be fighting for their lives against the wind and rain, but downhere, the water was calm and warm—peaceful. A true home.The selka were not the ones who had declared war.The stirring currents carried the faintest echoes from the raging storm. Theselka queen could taste the difference in the delicate flavors of salt as waterflowed through the fine gill slits at her neck. Though the selka were far fromthe reef labyrinth where they kept their precious treasure, the queen couldstill taste the bitter, alien taint of humans in the water.She swam faster than a shark, stroking along with webbed hands, her beautifulsmooth skin sliding through the water. Behind the queen, like a school ofpredator fish swimming in formation, came her selka army. Enraged, they swoopedthrough the currents with their fin-sharp bodies and claws that could mangle akraken. The selka queen had proven herself in undersea battle many times,gutting a hammerhead with her hands, spilling its entrails in clouds of murkyblood. As a people, the selka remembered the days of great human wars fromthousands of years ago … when their race had been created. Those were times oflegend, times of enslavement.Selka history told of how human wizards had tortured and modified unwillingsubjects, turning vulnerable swimmers into lethal aquatic weapons to fight intheir wars. Back then, the selka had been terrors of the sea, sinking entireenemy navies.But that had been long ago, and the air-breathing wizard masters had forgottenabout the selka. Their discarded warriors—former humans, now changed andimproved—had withdrawn into the deep cold waters, building homes in the reefsand on the seabeds. The selka were a free people now, frolicking, mating,exploring. They had their own civilization, unknown to the air breathers,undisturbed and at peace.Until the humans intruded, until the thieves wrecked the reef labyrinths, tookaway those things most precious to the selka, losses that could never berecovered. All those dreams …The selka had killed and devoured two of the thieves that swam down to take thewishpearls. They had seized those divers, holding them down. The queen knew thatthe weak air breathers would drown soon enough, expended air boiling out oftheir exhausted lungs, but such a quiet death was not a sufficient price forthem to pay. With her long claws the queen had torn open the throat of the firstdiver, watching red blood gush out in an explosion of bubbles.The second diver had struggled to escape from the selka soldiers, but he wasweak, unable to squirm away. As her people closed in to drink the flowing bloodfrom the first victim’s gaping neck wound, the selka queen saw the wide-eyedterror of the second victim, watched his last breath of air gasp out interrified astonishment. Before the light could dim from his eyes, she tore openhis throat as well and let her people feed.It was a beginning—and it was not enough.From the shape of the ship’s hull overhead and the lingering taste that itsbarnacled wood left in the water, the selka queen knew this was the same vesselthat had robbed the reef labyrinth several times. She knew it would come back,and therefore they must stop it. Perhaps if they killed the entire crew and sankthe wooden ship, this one battle would be enough. The humans might be wiseenough to stay away.Perhaps … perhaps not. And then it would be all-out war.Her people were hungry for blood. Human blood had a sharper, brighter taste thanfish, and tonight the selka would feed well.She arced upward, stroking toward the vessel that hung overhead. All told, morethan a hundred of her people swarmed up to the hull and grasped the slimy woodwith their clawed hands. Kicking and stroking, they emerged into the hostile airand scaled the side of the ship.* * *As she stepped over them, Nicci ignored the three moaning, emasculated men onthe floorboards wallowing in her vomit just inside her cabin. She still feltweak from the poison, but she took satisfaction from the fact that she hadpermanently disarmed the would-be rapists. She left them entirely behind.The Wavewalker shuddered in the throes of the storm, and Nicci stumbled againstthe wall of the narrow corridor as she tried to make her way to Nathan’s cabin.She wondered if the old wizard had heard the men’s screams, but the howlingstorm and the lashing wind were so loud she could barely think. Her skullpounded. Suddenly, Nicci doubled over, retching onto the deck. She hoped thewizard could help her, draw out the poison and spill it into the open air.When she reached his cabin, though, Nicci found the door ajar. He had gone outon deck into the whipping wind and the spray of waves. When she emerged outside,cold raindrops slapped her face, but the frigid shock braced her. The wind flungher hair in all directions. She sucked in a breath and shouted Nathan’s name.She saw him clinging to a ratline at the base of the mizzenmast. His long whitehair hung like wet ropes down past his shoulders. He had wrapped himself in anoilskin cloak, but the storm blew so hard that he was surely drenched. His facewas drawn, his expression queasy, and Nicci wondered if the wizard had beenpoisoned as well. More likely, Nathan was just seasick. He wore his sword at hisside, as if to battle the rain.Nicci stepped onto the wave-washed deck, as if drawing energy from the storm todrive away the lingering effects of the poison. Her black dress was soaked, butshe kept her balance. She made her way along by grabbing a ratline to holdherself steady as the ship plunged into the trough of a wave and then rose upagain in a sickening lurch.When Nathan saw her, his face split in a broad grin. “You look ill, Sorceress.The storm is not to your liking?”“Poison is not to my liking,” she shouted back into the howling noise. “But I’llrecover. Unfortunately, Captain Eli will have to find new wishpearl divers.” Shesaid nothing more.Nathan gave a small nod as he drew his own conclusions. “I’m sure you took careof them as was necessary.”Whitecaps foamed over the bow, spilling like a slop bucket across the deck.Several supply barrels broke loose from their ropes, rolled down the deck,smashed into the side wall, and bounced up and overboard to be lost in thewaves.Nathan caught himself on a rope and held on, then let out a disconcerting laughas he straightened. “A good storm and a surly crew make for a fine adventure,don’t you think?”Nicci tried to quell the pain that echoed through her skull, the knotting in herstomach. “I’m not doing this for adventure, but for Lord Rahl and his empire.”“I thought you were supposed to save the world.”“That is what the witch woman thinks.” She hunched as another spasm twisted hergut. “I will let Richard save the world in his own way.”The watch lookout had lashed himself to the platform for safety, but hemaintained his post to scan for rocks, reefs, or an unexpected coastline. Theswaying of the ship made his high perch like the end of an inverted pendulum,and he held on for dear life.The storm clouds knotted tighter over the night sky, like a strangler’s garrote.Flashes of lightning illuminated the sea and the rigging with jagged slices ofliquid silver.When Nicci heard a familiar shout, she shielded her eyes from the rain to see adrenched Bannon descending from the yardarm on the mainmast. He carried hissword, as if he might find enemies in the sky. It was an impractical choice, butthe young man took the blade wherever he went. Nathan watched his young protégéwith a measure of pride and incredulity.Halfway down the mast, Bannon stared out at the roiling sea and yelled somethingunintelligible. He pointed frantically.When another large wave crashed against the ship, the Wavewalker tilted at anextreme angle. Water rolled across the deck, sweeping away ropes, crates, andbroken debris. One young sailor was caught unawares and slipped from his anchorpoint on the rail. He tumbled and rolled, scrabbling with his hands until hecaught a precarious perch, holding on.Nicci tried to gather her control of the air and wind, just enough to catch thehapless sailor, to save him. Then she spotted what had struck such a look ofterror on Bannon’s face from his high perch.Just as the clinging sailor lost his grip and was about to fly over the edge inthe curling wash of water, a creature climbed over the rail and caught him, ahumanlike figure with clawed, webbed hands. The panicked young sailor grabbedfor anything, any hope of rescue, and the thing snagged him. The pale-skinnedcreature grabbed the sailor’s striped shirt and seized his wet brown hair withthe other hand.For a moment it seemed as if the slimy thing had saved him—but then it opened amouth full of sharp, triangular teeth and bit down on the side of the seaman’shead, taking away half of his face and the top of his skull. As the sailorscreamed and struggled, the monster tore open his throat, then cast the bodyonto the deck, discarding its victim in a wash of blood and seawater.Nicci knew instinctively what they were. “Selka,” she whispered. “They must beselka.”Sailors on deck shouted an alarm as a dozen more slick figures scrambled fromthe depths, climbing the Wavewalker’s hull to swarm the decks."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 15 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch15]The invading creatures were sleek and smooth, with muscles rippling beneaththeir gray-green skin. Nicci remembered Nathan’s story that the selka had beenhuman once, tortured and reshaped into a race of aquatic warriors. These things,though, looked as if they had forgotten their humanity long ago.They opened their slit mouths wide, gasping in the rain-lashed air, to revealrows of triangular fangs. A filmy membrane covered their large eyes, and pupilslits widened to encompass the few hardy sailors on duty. A serrated fin ranfrom the hairless head down the spine, and frills of swimming fins adorned theirforearms and legs.The Wavewalker was vulnerable, caught in the fierce storm. The sailors couldbarely survive the weather’s fury, and now deadly sea people swarmed aboard.Shouting for help, crewmen scrambled across the deck to find harpoons and boathooks for weapons.Three selka skittered forward like the flash of fish in a brook. The veteransailor Karl grabbed a harpoon and swung the wooden shaft with a grunt to defendhimself, but he had inadvertently seized the harpoon whose point was eaten awayby jellyfish acid, rendering the weapon little more than a club. Karl foughtnevertheless. He smashed the face of one selka, flattening its smooth head. Itsgill slits flapped, oozing blood.The other two creatures were upon Karl. The big seaman punched and struggled,but one selka held him down while the second ripped open his chest, splittingthe sternum and peeling his ribs apart. Together, the selka dug into the gapingwound and yanked out his slippery organs as Karl shrieked into the raging winds.Nicci stood her ground by the door to the stern deck, still trying to drive backher disorientation as she searched for magic inside her, any kind of spell thatwould let her fight. The poison had debilitated her, and she had just exertedherself to defeat Sol and his vile companions. She was in no shape to attack.Nevertheless, she clutched at shreds of power inside her, trying to summon afireball, but the winds tore around her. A cold, wet backwash dashed into herface, disrupting her concentration. Flinging salt water out of her eyes, sheused her anger to bring focus, and fire blossomed in her right hand. Finally.She felt a rush of relief.A male selka prowled toward her, its slitted eyes focused on her. The creaturelunged just as Nicci hurled the fireball, which splattered against its slimychest. The flames burned and bubbled its skin, and the selka hooted a strangeresonant cry that echoed through flapping gill slits in its neck. Mortallywounded, the selka staggered away and collapsed on the deck.Bannon managed to swing himself down from the ratlines, holding his sword. Helooked terrified, but ready to fight. When he tried to make his way over to thewizard and the sorceress, Nathan spotted him. His voice was hard, grim.“Remember what I taught you, my boy!”Dozens more selka swarmed over the side of the ship and fell upon the sailors.Two burly men stood side by side, jabbing and slashing with the serrated ironspear points of harpoons. They sliced open slime-covered hides, wounding threeattackers—but fifteen more fell upon them. The men kept stabbing with theirharpoons until clawed hands tore the weapons out of their grasp; then the selkaturned the weapons upon the sailors in a feeding and killing frenzy.Bannon tottered forward on the rocking deck, trying to keep his balance while heswung his lackluster sword against the monsters. Sturdy’s edge was sharp, and hetook off the arm of one attacker, then swung backward to chop the neck ofanother, nearly cutting off its head.A selka rushed toward Bannon from behind, webbed hands outstretched, but Niccisummoned another fireball and hurled it at the creature’s head. The flamesstruck home, and its flesh steamed and exploded. Shrieking, the thing doveoverboard, ignoring its victim.Bannon whirled, blinking in astonishment, and shouted an unintelligible thanksto Nicci.As the sailors kept yelling for reinforcements, some of the off-duty crew threwopen a deck hatch and emerged from below. Seeing the swarming creatures, thecrew shouted to rouse the sailors in the lower decks. Rallied at last, the mengrabbed whatever weapons they could find and boiled up out of the hatch todefend the ship.But when the disoriented seamen climbed into the open storm, hissing selkaconverged on the hatch. The next sailor up was a tall, thin man who had beenadept at patching sails. As soon as he popped his head up into the air, a selkaslipped claws beneath his chin, hooked into his jawbone, and lifted him like afish on a line. The man dangled by his head, and his arms and legs jitteredspasmodically as the monsters gutted him, letting his blood spill down onto theother sailors trying to climb up. The selka discarded the body and then poureddown the ladder, invading the lower decks where the crew members weretrapped—and slaughtered.Four attackers stalked forward as rain slashed down and salt water scoured thedeck. Nicci stood firm, defiant, despite the roiling dizziness inside her. Shefelt the rage within, and reminded herself that she had been a Sister of theDark, that she had stolen magic from many wizards. Even weakened by the poison,she was more powerful than any foe these creatures had ever seen.The wind howled, and she pulled energy from it, reshaped it, brought the stormcloser. As the selka attacked her and Nathan, she pushed back, throwing abattering ram of air. The blow knocked six creatures up over the ship’s rail,high into the air, and flung them far out to sea.Striding forward, Nathan raised both hands, trying to summon a blast of his ownmagic. She could tell by his stance and his intent expression that he must becalling on a powerful spell. As ten more aquatic attackers climbed aboard theWavewalker, Nathan gestured to fling a magical bombardment at them—and his facefilled with a perplexed expression when nothing happened. He waved his handsagain to no effect, and the selka surged toward him, undeterred.“Nathan!” Nicci shouted.The old wizard kept trying to summon magic, but failed. He seemed too confusedto be afraid.Just in time, Bannon leaped next to him, swinging his sword to hack into thenearest selka. As that one collapsed, he stabbed a second one, offering a darkgrin to the wizard. “I’ll save you if you need it.”Nathan looked at his empty hand in confusion. “I’m not supposed to need it.”Nicci wondered if the wizard had also been poisoned. She trembled dizzily. Herlast spell had left her spent, but Nicci could not afford to be spent—there werestill too many attackers.A blond sailor picked up an empty barrel and threw it at a selka. The creaturegrappled with him just as a large wave smashed into the deck, sweeping bothoverboard. The sailor went under, and Nicci never saw him resurface in thechurning cauldron of waves.Captain Eli burst out of his stateroom, screaming commands to his men. “Selka!”he cried, as if he had encountered them before. “Damn you, leave my ship alone!”He had brought his cutlass and a long rod that he used for clouting unrulysailors. With a weapon in each hand, he marched forward to meet the attackers.Identifying the captain, the selka closed in on him, but he stood his ground onthe wet deck. As the creatures came forward, the captain struck sideways withhis long rod and slashed wildly with his sword in the other hand.The cutlass lopped off a webbed hand at the wrist, and he hacked and clubbed,driving the selka back, but more closed in around him. His rod flattened slimyfaces, broke sharp teeth, but selka hands snatched at him. Finally, one seizedthe club and tore it from his grasp.Outnumbered, the captain kept fighting with his cutlass, slicing and choppingthe attackers, but one of the selka took up the club he had lost and used thehard rod to strike Captain Eli’s wrist, shattering his forearm. He gasped inpain, no longer able to hold his sword, and the curved blade clattered to thedeck.Unable to fight, the captain retreated into the chart room, nursing his brokenarm. He barricaded the door, but the selka made short work of it, splinteringthe wood before flooding into the chamber. Captain Eli’s screams were quicklyfollowed by the sounds of shattered glass from the stern windows. Hurled outinto the night, the man’s body floundered into the roiling wake of the ship. Thesea creatures dove after him to have their feast before he could drown.As the storm surged and Nathan struggled unsuccessfully to call on his gift,Nicci used every trick she knew, summoning a tangled combination of Additive andSubtractive Magic to draw bolts of black lightning. The first blast lashed oneselka through the heart, leaving a smoking crater.Beside her, Nathan looked bleak. “The magic … I can’t find my magic! It’s gone.”He raised his hand again to work a spell, curling his fingers. His azure eyesfilled with fury, but with no result. “It’s gone!”Nicci had no time to understand what was wrong with him. Desperate, she managedto call up a deadly gout of wizard’s fire. When the crackling ball boiled in herhand, she released it. The wizard’s fire swelled like a comet in the air andengulfed four selka that had cornered a lone sailor. The sailor’s screamschanged, then ended abruptly along with their hissing, writhing shrieks as thedeadly incineration erased them all.But the uncontrolled wizard’s fire kept sizzling across the deck, charring astack of barrels, and setting the deck and hull boards on fire. The magicalincendiary kept burning, but the pounding rain and waves eventually doused therelentless fire.Nicci sagged, not sure how much more energy she possessed, though she needed tokeep fighting, because the selka kept coming.Three weak and wretched men staggered out of the doorway from the cabins in thestern deck. The shirtless wishpearl divers walked with agonized scissorlikesteps, blinded and disoriented. Sol, Elgin, and Rom could barely move, and theycertainly couldn’t fight.But the men were not entirely useless. At least they provided a moment’sdiversion for the attacking selka.When two sea creatures closed around the divers, Sol’s eyes were filled withpain and blood. He reached out, as if he didn’t realize that the selka was notone of his shipmates. The aquatic creature wrapped a webbed hand around histhroat, slamming him against the wall as it grabbed his lower abdomen with itsother hand. A hooked claw dug deep into Sol’s pubic bone and slowly curledupward to slice through the man’s groin all the way up to the base of histhroat, like the knife of a fisherman gutting his catch. Sol’s entrails spilledout like wet, tangled ropes. As he collapsed, the selka passed him into the armsof another creature, who pulled him open wider, then dug pointed teeth intoSol’s chest cavity and began to eat his heart.More creatures grabbed a gibbering Elgin, who slapped uselessly with his barehands as the monsters ripped him open as well and tossed him aside for the othercreatures to devour.The third diver, Rom, turned and tried to flee, but the selka grabbed him frombehind and sliced open his back, prying loose his entire spine with a few ribsstill attached. After uprooting the vertebrae from his body, the creaturesdropped the jellylike bag of skin and meat to the deck.Giving up on trying to fight with magic, Nathan tore his ornate sword from itsscabbard and held it up, defying the sea people. Standing shoulder-to-shoulderwith Bannon, the two men attacked the monstrous creatures. With a fixed andbrutal expression, Bannon swung Sturdy like a woodcutter hacking his way througha thicket.For his own part, the wizard embraced his new role of swordsman. He threw offhis rain slicker for freedom of movement and swung his blade in a graceful arc,catching one of the monsters under the chin and cutting its throat all the wayback to the neck bone. He spun with a downsweep that cleaved through theshoulder and the chest of another.While Nicci recovered from unleashing her wizard’s fire, two selka closed in onher. She summoned enough energy to shove them aside with a barricade of air, butshe couldn’t call sufficient force to knock them overboard. Within moments, theselka came back, angrier now, and she faced them, ready to do whatever she hadto do.A panicked sailor scrambled up the ratlines, trying to climb to escape. Hereached the yardarm on the mainmast, then pulled himself to the dubious safetyof the lookout platform. When the attacking selka saw him unprotected up there,they swarmed up the ropes, closing in, and the man had nowhere to run.With a loud and startling crack, a natural bolt of lightning struck the topyard,shivering the entire mast into splinters, and throwing the sailor from theplatform. His smoking body was already limp as it crashed into the water out ofsight.The blast also scattered the climbing selka. Falling, one grabbed on to thefurled mainsail, pulling on the unrolled canvas and slicing the fabric with itsclaws. With a groan, the smoking, splintered mast toppled forward, crashing intothe rigging and snapping the Wavewalker’s foremast as well.When Nathan gaped in dismay at the disaster, one of the creatures sprang on himfrom behind, grabbing his back and tearing his fine new shirt. Bannon ran hissword sideways through the selka’s ribs, skewering it. He used all of hisstrength to tear the dying creature from the wizard, stomped on its slimy chest,and yanked his sword back out.“Thank you, my boy,” Nathan said in disbelief.“You taught me well,” Bannon said.Nicci dredged deep for another scrap of energy to create a second ball ofwizard’s fire, but she knew it wouldn’t be enough.Bannon’s expression fell as he looked toward the bow. “Sweet Sea Mother, theykeep coming!”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 16 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch16]Storm waves slid across the deck, but even that wasn’t enough to wash away theblood of the slaughtered sailors. The attacking selka devoured their victims,fighting over hearts and livers, gnawing through arms and legs.Nicci summoned another branch of blue-black lightning that lashed the selka likea cat-o’-nine tails. The stench of roasting meat and coppery blood was mixedwith a powerful odor of burnt, salty slime.After releasing her lightning, though, Nicci reeled, barely able to keep herbalance as she continued to fight off nausea and the hammering pain in her head.When she staggered back to recover her strength, Nathan defended her againstmore oncoming creatures. Although the wizard’s magic had been rendered impotent,his sword remained deadly.Wild and reckless, Bannon stabbed and slashed, but forgot to protect his flank.A selka dove in and raked a long cut down Bannon’s left thigh, although beforethe creature could do more damage, Nathan leaped in and decapitated the thing.The selka’s face stared up as it rolled, the thick-lipped mouth reflexivelyopening and closing to show its pointed teeth. Nathan kicked the severed headover the side of the boat as if it were a ball in a game of Ja’La.When Nicci sensed a change come over the attackers, she looked toward the bow asone creature more magnificent than the others climbed over the rail. The selkawas obviously female, and a flush of leopardlike spots swirled along her slickgreenish body. The other selka turned to regard their queen with reverence.Even with the howling wind, crashing waves, and creaking timbers, a hush settledover the Wavewalker. The selka queen stood at the bow, her back turned to thecarved wooden figurehead of the beautiful Sea Mother. The queen spoke in aneerie, warbling voice, as if she had not spoken words in the air—or words in thenormal language of humankind—in her entire life. “Thieves must die. Your bloodcannot pay for the damage you’ve caused.”Nathan shouted, “We have stolen nothing.”Bannon’s eyes went wide, as if he suddenly understood the answer. And then Nicciknew as well. “The wishpearls,” she said.The selka queen said, “Wishpearls are the seeds of our dreams. Teardrops of ouressence, our greatest treasure. The selka are no longer part of your race, nolonger part of your world. We have come to take our dreams back. Our pearls.”The dead bodies of sailors on deck far outnumbered sailors who remained alive.The ship itself was nearly destroyed, its mainmast toppled, the foremastsmashed, and fires smoldered in the wreckage of sails and snapped yardarms.Vicious selka swarmed below, ransacking the lower decks and the cargo hold. Morescreams accompanied a clash of swords and clubs, until the last sailorsdefending the lower decks were also killed.Through the large open hatch, Nicci could hear the desperate lowing of the milkcow rise to a crescendo then fall silent. Before long, three selka returned tothe deck, carrying large hunks of raw, bloody meat to offer their queen.As the female creature glared at Nicci, Bannon, and Nathan crowded together inmutual defense, two burly selka climbed back to the open deck. They hefted awooden chest that they had found behind locked doors in the cargo hold, and nowthey dropped it with a crash in front of the regal creature. The queen’s eyeslits widened as her followers tore off the lid with such force that they rippedthe hinges entirely off and splintered the wooden sides.The chest was full of wishpearls harvested only days before.Staring down at the treasure, the inhuman queen scooped the pearls in her webbedhands and held them up as if they were the raindrops of miracles. She raised heralien face to let out a hissing cry. “The seeds of our dreams!”The queen cast the pearls back into the water, returning them to the sea. Shepicked up more wishpearls and gently, lovingly, scattered them into the ragingocean, as if she were planting a crop. She continued until she had emptied theentire chest.As if hearing an unspoken command, the selka redoubled their attack and threwthemselves upon the last desperate sailors aboard the Wavewalker.Bannon and Nathan crouched on either side of Nicci, holding their swords andready to fight to the death. As the attackers came toward them, Nicci openedherself to her magic, called upon everything she had learned, and stolen, fromother wizards. Even though she had little left within her, she neverthelessmanaged to summon more wizard’s fire, a desperate act. A small blazing sphereappeared in her hands, which she augmented with normal fire, then an evenbrighter halo of illusion. To the selka, it appeared as if she held a sun in herhands.The crackling globe of wizard’s fire hung ready, but Nicci kept it as her lastdefense. Once she used it, she doubted she would have any flicker of magic leftwith which to attack. But Nicci didn’t need magic. She had taken a knife fromone of the fallen sailors, and she would keep fighting.The selka queen strode forward to face them. The rest of her warriors snarledand gurgled. Nicci lifted her wizard’s fire into the standoff. “With this, I cankill most of you, including the queen. Would you like to taste my fire?”The female creature was terrifying and magnificent. As the sea people pressedcloser, several seemed curious about Bannon, their gill slits flickering. Thequeen fixed her slitted eyes on the young man. “We know you,” she finally said.“We saved you. Once. Why did you come back?”“We didn’t mean any harm.” He blinked at her, covered with blood. Claw marks andgashes marked his skin and face, and his sword dripped with blood and slime fromthe selka he had killed. He said in a whisper of dismay, “I thought the selkawere magical. I called on you to save me when I was younger. But now I seeyou’re just monsters.”A flush suffused the leopard spots on the female creature, and the frills of herbodily fins extended. “We are the monsters?”From below, a loud cracking sound rumbled through the deck, a sickening,destructive blow to the hull. The selka were breaking the ship. Storm lightningshattered the sky again.The queen turned to Nicci, who refused to flinch. Her crackling ball of firereflected off of the slick greenish skin of the creatures. Even with all theselka they had killed, more than sixty remained to face them.All the other sailors aboard had been murdered, and even if she used her ball ofwizard’s fire, Nicci knew she would kill some, but not enough, of the creatures.Then she remembered.Nicci fished in the fabric of her dress, found the hidden pocket, and withdrewthe wishpearl Bannon had given her just after their departure from Tanimura. Itfelt cold in her fingertips. One last wishpearl, probably the last aboard theship. The seeds of our dreams.She held it up in the fingers of her free hand, and the selka queen hissed. Theother creatures reacted, simmering, ready to lunge forward even with thethreatening ball of magical fire Nicci held.While the selka watched her intently, Nicci threw the wishpearl as far out tosea as she could, and the storm-churned waves quickly swallowed it. “Let thefish have my wishes,” she said. “I make my own life.”The selka queen watched her with respect and finally announced, “Maybe you arenot thieves.” She turned to the remaining creatures in her army. “We arefinished.”The blood-spattered selka grabbed some of the remaining human corpses anddragged them overboard into the raging sea. Others took the bodies of the slainselka with them.At the splintered side wall of the ship, the selka queen faced Nicci for a longmoment, staring at the threat of the wizard’s fire, before she turned and doveoverboard in a perfectly graceful arc. The rest of her people joined her,abandoning the Wavewalker.They left Nicci, Bannon, and Nathan alone as the storm finished the destructionthat the selka had begun."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 17 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch17]The Wavewalker had been mortally wounded. Two of her masts were broken, and thetorn sails whipped about like spectral streamers. The battle with the selka hadsmashed the vessel’s bow, torn the ropes and the rigging. The deck boards weresplintered, and an even greater slaughter had taken place in the lower decks.The smell of blood and offal wafted up from the open hatches.Nicci and her companions stood together, the only survivors on the ship, tenseand waiting for some renewed attack from the undersea creatures. Unable tomaintain the flow of magic, she finally let the manifested sphere of wizard’sfire dissipate in her hand. She hoped they were safe from further attack, eventhough the selka queen had made no promises. As the fireball faded, she heaved adeep breath and clung to the tattered remnant of a ratline to keep her balance.As the Wavewalker rode up on the high crest of a wave and crashed down again,they were all thrown to their knees.“Sorry I couldn’t help you during the battle, Sorceress.” Nathan sounded bothbaffled and afraid. He looked at his hands. “I could not find the magic insideme. I tried to summon spells I’ve used all my life, even simple ones. I couldn’tdo them.”“It was the heat of the battle. You couldn’t concentrate,” Bannon said. “Butyour sword proved deadly enough. You saved me.”“Oh, more than once, I expect.” Nathan forced an unlikely smile. “But you savedme as well. We made a decent accounting of ourselves.” His shoulders rose andfell, and he turned to Nicci again. “Try as I might, I couldn’t touch my Han.”He reached up, ran his fingers gingerly along his neck. “Is there an iron collarI can’t see? An invisible Rada’Han placed on me to prevent me from using mypowers?”Nicci knew full well how the Sisters in the Palace of the Prophets hadcontrolled their gifted male students through the use of an iron collar, whichblocked them from using the force of life. Nathan had worn such a collar formuch of his life as a captive prophet, and Richard had been forced to wear onewhen he was taken for training by the Sisters.“I’m not aware of any outside force neutralizing your gift, Wizard,” Nicci saidas they stood back up. “But you were losing your magic earlier, even before theselka arrived. You couldn’t even summon a flame as a trick to show Bannon.”Nathan hung his head. “Dear spirits, I knew I’d lost my gift of prophecy, butnow I have lost my magic as well? I don’t even feel whole anymore.”Rain continued to pelt them, and the wind was so heavy the droplets felt likethick pellets of ice. Another broken yardarm splintered, cracked, and crashed tothe deck after a loud gust of wind wrenched it loose. The waves smashed theprow, sending a violent shudder through the entire ship, and Nicci barely kepther feet by clinging tighter to the ropes.“If we make it through this night, I will be happy to consider furtherexplanations,” she said.Bannon struggled to make his way closer to them. Water ran down his face, andNicci couldn’t tell whether he was crying. “What do we do now?”Nicci found a grim strength in her answer. “We survive. That is up to us.”The deck had begun to tilt alarmingly, and the Wavewalker rode much lower in thewater. “We should search belowdecks,” Bannon said. “There might be othersurvivors.”“Yes, my boy, we’d better check.” Nathan gave Nicci a knowing glance. They bothunderstood there would be no survivors.Nicci remembered hearing the sea creatures smashing about, battering the hullboards. “We also need to see what damage the selka did. I think they intended towreck the ship even after they killed us all.”They climbed down through the open hatches. The confined spaces reeked of bloodand entrails, a gagging stench like a butcher shop filled with chamber pots.They found the cow’s head and scraps of its hide that the selka had peeled awayand left like discarded drapes against the bulkheads.The selka had left the ravaged bodies of dead sailors down in the crew decks,hammocks torn loose from the bulkheads and support beams. One young sailor hungby the back of his skull from a hammock hook.A thundering sound of rushing water down in the cargo hold was even moreominous. When they lifted the hatches and stared down into the lower hold, Niccimanaged to create a small hand light to illuminate the inky shadows. Part of thehull had been smashed and splintered from the outside, the cracked boardspressed inward. Swimming beneath the vessel, the selka must have attacked thewooden planks until they opened a jagged hole. Water roared in now, unstoppable,filling the hold.“The Wavewalker is going to sink,” Nathan said. “It’s only a matter of hours.”“We can seal the hatches,” Nicci said. “Confine the flooding to the bottom hold.That might buy us half a day.”“Can’t we patch the hull?” Bannon asked. “I could hold my breath, swim downthere, and do some work.”Seawater gushed in, already half filling the lower hold. Nicci understood thatthe force of the flow would shatter any repairs as quickly as they were put inplace.“If I had my magic,” Nathan said, “I could restore the planks, grow more wood inplace.”“Let me try,” Nicci said. It was Additive Magic, using the wood itself, buildingupon what already existed. She reached into herself, but her every fibertrembled, wrung dry. She had already used so much magic in the battle, and theinsidious poison still hadn’t worn off.Nevertheless, the ship was sinking, and she had no time to lose. Nicci squeezedher eyes shut, focused her thoughts, summoned all the magic she could find. Withher gift, she sensed the shattered hull planks, found the ragged edges, and usedmagic to draw more wood, making it grow. She pulled the smashed hole togetherlike a scab over a wound, but the ocean continued to push its way in, and hernewly formed wood broke apart, leaving her to start all over again.Nathan grasped her shoulder as if to force strength into her, but she could drawnothing from him. Instead, she thought of her anger, thought of the murderousselka, thought of Sol, Elgin, and Rom and what they had done to her—what theyhad done to the entire crew of the Wavewalker. The repercussions went far beyondtheir attempted rape, because if those fools hadn’t poisoned her, Nicci wouldhave been at her peak strength as a sorceress, and the selka would never havedefeated them.In the flash of her disgust and fury she found another tiny spark, pulled moremagic, and made the planks grow again, closing up, until she forcibly sealed thehole that the selka had smashed through the hull. When the water finally stoppedpouring in, she shuddered. “It’s fixed, but still fragile.”Bannon sighed with delight. “Now that we’re not sinking anymore, we have time tofind scraps of wood! I’ll dive down and shore up the patch. We can make itsolid.”For the next hour the young man threw himself into the task, holding his breathlike a wishpearl diver and plunging down into the flooded hold. Remnants ofcargo and crew floated all around: crates, heavy casks, bolts of sailcloth, andseveral bodies. But Bannon eventually succeeded in reinforcing the patch ofmagically repaired wood.Outside, the storm continued with full force, and when they finally climbed backto the open, tilted deck, they looked in dismay at the torn rigging, the brokenmasts, the charred spots where wizard’s fire had burned the prow.At the stern, the chart room was a shambles. The navigator’s wheel had beenknocked off its pedestal. The currents and winds pushed the wreck onward,unguided. They had no captain, no charts, no way to steer. Though the night hadalready seemed endless, the darkness remained thick, strangled with clouds.Standing at the bow, shielding his eyes, Bannon pointed ahead. “Look at thewater there. That foamy line?” Then he yelled in alarm. “It’s reefs! Morereefs!”With added fury, the storm shoved the helpless ship forward, and Nicci saw thatthey were being inevitably pushed toward the fanged rocks and the churningspray.“Brace yourselves!” Nathan shouted.Nicci tried to manipulate the wind, the waves, but the ship was an ungainly,doomed hulk. The sea had an implacable grip. The winds were ugly and capricious.With a terrible grinding roar the ship drove up on the reefs. Dark rocks brokethe keel and gouged open the lower hull. The deck boards splintered andscattered apart. The mizzenmast toppled into the water.As the night thickened through flickers of lightning, Nicci thought she saw thedark silhouette of a distant coastline. Impossible and unreachable, the landprovided only the mocking hope of safety. But only for a moment.Angry seawater rushed aboard as the great ship broke apart and sank."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 18 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch18]Having wrought sufficient havoc, the storm dissipated and fled. The scatteredclouds moved on like camp followers after a victorious army. Waves rolled andwashed up on the rock-studded sand.Nicci awoke to the shrieks of gulls fighting over some prized piece of carrion.Her entire body felt battered. Her muscles and bones ached from within, and herstomach still roiled, mostly from seawater she had swallowed in her struggle toswim ashore in the wind-blasted night. She brushed gritty sand from her face andbent over to retch repeatedly, but produced no more than a thimbleful ofsour-tasting bile. She rolled onto her back and looked up into the searing sky,trying to get her bearings in her spinning mind and memories.She heard the waves rumbling and booming as they crashed against the shore,slamming into the headlands, but here on the long crescent of a sandy beach, sheseemed safe. She propped herself up on an elbow to reassess her situation, onestep at a time. First, her own body. She felt no broken bones, only some bruisesand abrasions from being thrown overboard and hurled by waves onto the shore.Nicci inhaled again, exhaled, forced a calm on the queasiness inside her. Herheart was beating, her blood pumping. Air filled her lungs. She was restored nowand could once again touch the tapestry of magic that was a familiar part of herentire life. She had been so weak after the wishpearl divers poisoned her, andNicci did not like to feel weak.The flood of memories crashed in like a riptide—the storm, the selka attack, theshipwreck.…She climbed to her feet and stood swaying, but steadied herself. She was alive,and she was alone.The gulls shrieked and cawed, challenging one another. A flurry ofblack-and-white wings settled around several corpses washed up on the shore,broken sailors from the Wavewalker. Birds fought over the bodies, pecking at theflesh, squabbling over choice morsels, although there was feast enough to gorgea hundred gulls. One seized a loose eyeball and plucked it out, held it by theoptic nerve, and flew away while four other birds stormed after it with accusingscreams.At first Nicci thought one of the bodies might be Bannon’s, but she saw that thedead man had long blond hair. Just one of the sailors she did not know. Sincethese dead men were beyond her help or her interest, she turned to scan down thestrand for any survivors.The beach was strewn with wreckage deposited by the storm: splintered hullplanks, smashed kegs, a spar that had been strangled by ropes and tatteredsailcloth. Larger barrels lay tossed along the sand, some halfway buried by theoutgoing tide, like dice tossed by giants in a capricious game of chance.She waited motionless, like a statue, just trying to regain her mental balance.So much for their quest to find Kol Adair. She was cast on this desolate shore,with no idea where she was. She had never believed the witch woman had anysecret knowledge. Nicci stood there bedraggled and bruised, lost, and she didnot feel ready to save the world in any fashion, not for Richard Rahl, not forherself.Even with the crashing waves, the whistling wind, and the shrieking gulls, Niccifelt overcome by oppressive silence. She was alone.Then a voice called to her. “Sorceress! Nicci!”She spun to see Bannon Farmer coming toward her. He looked waterlogged, hisginger hair clumpy and tangled, his face bruised. His left cheek had beensmashed and discolored, and a long cut ran across his forehead, but his grinovershadowed those details. He bounded around a large curved section of brokenhull that had piled up against a rock outcropping.“Sweet Sea Mother! I didn’t think I’d find anyone else alive.” His homespunshirt was drying in the hot sun, leaving a sparkle of crusted salt on thefabric. “I woke up with sand in my mouth and no one around. I’d been caught insome tide pools about fifty feet from shore. I called out, but no one answered.”The young man lifted his arm to display his lackluster sword. “I somehow kept mygrip on Sturdy, though.”Nicci ran her eyes over his body, checking to make sure he hadn’t been woundedmore severely than he realized. On the battlefield, she had often witnessed howshock and fear could deceive a man about how hurt he really was. Bannon seemedintact and resilient.She asked, “Have you found Nathan?”A look of alarm crossed his face. “No, you’re the first person I’ve seen.” Hesquared his shoulders. “But I just started looking. I’m sure Nathan’s alive,though. He is a great wizard, after all.”Nicci frowned, knowing that Nathan had been unable to use magic during the selkaattack. With concern for the old wizard, she made her way down the beach,shaking off any lingering aches and dizziness. “Where did you search? Have yougone this way?”“I came from back there.” Bannon pointed. “That’s where I washed up. But most ofthe Wavewalker wreckage is scattered down here. Maybe the currents broughtNathan in this direction.”The sunlight was so bright on the sand that it hurt Nicci’s eyes. She squinted,shaded her brow so she could look down the coastline, which curved out into anelbow of headlands that drew fierce waves like a magnet. Whitecaps battered therocks, and the explosive boom could be heard even a mile away. If Nathan’s bodyhad been thrown into that cauldron, he would have been smashed into a pulp.With surprising energy Bannon ranged ahead, calling the wizard’s name. Niccihalf expected that they would find his smashed corpse sprawled on the sand underanother busy cluster of seagulls.Halfway to the loudest crashing waves, they saw yards of sailcloth draped like aburial shroud on the beach, amid the remnants of splintered crates. Bannonspotted a tumbled pile of barrels, rope, and more wadded canvas. Nicci caught upwith the young man just as he lifted a ragged swatch of sailcloth and cried out,“Here he is!”Bannon grasped the shoulders of Nathan’s ruffled shirt. The old man layfacedown, draped over a broken barrel. His long white hair hung in tanglesaround his face. When she saw him there unmoving, Nicci’s immediate impressionwas that he was dead, drowned and cast aside.Bannon rolled him off the barrel and laid the man flat on his back on the sand.Nathan’s skin was a pale gray; his eyelids didn’t even flicker. Bannon bent overhim, listened for a breath, touched the older man’s cheeks, peeled open hiseyes. With an urgent, determined look, he rolled the wizard over, wrapped hisforearms around Nathan’s waist from behind, and put his fists right up againstthe abdomen. He pulled hard with a short, sharp jerk, forcing Nathan toconvulse. Bannon clenched his arms again with enough power that Nicci thought hemight snap the wizard’s spine. Instead, a fountain of seawater spewed fromNathan’s mouth. He convulsed again and then coughed.His hands feebly swatted at Bannon, but the young man showed surprisingstrength. He laid him on his back in the sand again and began pumping his longlegs, pushing Nathan’s knees up against his chest as hard as he could. Nathancoughed and expelled more water from the side of his mouth before finallygaining enough strength to push Bannon away.“Enough, my boy! I’ve survived as much as I’m going to.” He looked miserable andshook his head, then ran his fingers through his hair.Nicci looked curiously at the young man. “He was drowned. Where did you learnthat?”“On Chiriya we knew how to rescue drowned fishermen. Often it doesn’t work, butif there is still a spark of life and we can get the water out of his lungs, theSea Mother sometimes lets a man breathe again.”“I’m not just a man,” Nathan said in a rattling voice. “I’m a wizard.” He bentover and vomited copious amounts of seawater.“Clearly the Sea Mother showed you mercy,” Nicci said.As he sat up, still wobbly, Nathan put a hand to his right temple, where a longdeep gash in his forehead still bled. “I’m pleased to find myself alive again. Agood way to start the day.” He touched the gash again and winced. He closed hiseyes, obviously concentrating, and his expression fell. When he looked up atNicci, his face was forlorn. “Alas, the gift still eludes me. Might I humblyrequest that you heal me, Sorceress? Remove at least one inconvenience.” He gaveher a sudden worried look. “Or is your power gone as well? You were havingdifficulty during the battle—”“I am fine,” she said. “Those were aftereffects of the wishpearl divers’ poison.Fortunately, I am recovering better than those men are.”Bannon turned to her with a strange expression. “The divers poisoned you?” Hewiped sand out of his reddened eye.Nicci gauged his expression carefully. “Yes, in the pot of chowder youdelivered.” She could tell by the look on his face that he hadn’t known, whichgave her a sense of relief. “That was why I felt so weak I could barely fightthe selka. I was racked by poison.”His expression turned to dismay. “In the food I brought? I poisoned you? Ididn’t know! I didn’t mean to! Sweet Sea Mother, I am so sorry, I—”In a similar circumstance, Nicci knew that Jagang would have murdered the youngman, slowly and painfully, for such an error. There were times when Death’sMistress would have killed him as well, but she was different now. Richard hadchanged her. Seeing Bannon’s abject misery, his open honesty, she was remindedagain of why she had not suspected the meal he’d brought.Nodding slowly to herself, she said, “That is why they used you, Bannon Farmer.I would never think you capable of treachery or of trying to harm me in anyway.”“I’m not! I would never poison you.”“You see, your very innocence was a weapon that others turned against me. Theyduped you.” She hardened her voice. “Don’t let it happen again.” As he stammeredand offered far too many apologies, Nicci flexed her fingers, felt the magic,felt strong again. “It no longer matters. I have recovered.” She laid her handon Nathan’s temple and easily summoned what she needed to knit the torn flesh ofhis wound.He let out a sigh of relief. “Thank you. It was not dire, but it was anannoyance.”She turned to Bannon, looked at his battered form. “And now you.”The young man took a step away, uneasy about her magic, or maybe not convincedthat she had actually forgiven him. “There’s no need, Sorceress. They are butminor injuries. I will recover by myself in time.” He touched the slash on histhigh.But Nicci, needing to reassure herself that she had full control over her powersagain, reached out to grasp his arm. “I insist.” She let the power flow, and hisbruises vanished, his cuts healed. The flicker of fear vanished from his face.“That’s wonderful! I feel like I could fight the selka all over again.” Hegripped his sword.“Let’s hope we don’t have to do that, my boy,” said Nathan.Nicci brushed sand off her black dress and tied her hair back out of her eyes.“I want you both intact. We have work to do.” She looked up and down the coast.“We need to learn where we are.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 19 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch19]After he accepted his disheveled appearance, Nathan insisted on searching thewreckage to locate his sword, as well as any other items they might find usefulfor their survival. After all the misfortunes they had suffered, he had littlehope of retrieving his precious weapon, but by a stroke of good luck he did findhis ornate blade. The sword was wedged between a splintered wine cask and acrate that had held brightly dyed fabrics for market, which were now waterloggedand ruined.The wizard pulled the blade free and raised it into the sunlight with a sigh ofsatisfaction. “That’s much better!” He winked at Bannon. “Now you and I, my boy,can defend our sorceress against any attackers.”“The gulls and crabs are surely trembling in fear.” Nicci rolled her eyes andgot down to serious business. “Before we set off, we should salvage any supplieswe can find. There’s no telling how far we are from civilization, or how long itwill take us to get back to the D’Haran Empire.” Even after their ordeals, shecontinued to think of what she needed to do for Richard and his vision for thefuture.Along with several other mangled corpses of Wavewalker sailors, they found anintact keg of drinking water, from which they drank their fill, then a crate ofsalted meat. Nathan was discouraged to have lost all the new shirts, vests, andcloaks he had purchased in Tanimura, but he did discover a sailor’s trunk thatcontained a fresh shirt that fit Bannon, a tortoiseshell comb, and a packet ofwaterlogged letters, the ink now running and smeared. The few decipherable wordsindicated they were notes from a lost sweetheart who would now never get aresponse from her beloved.“Take only what we can use.” Nicci pulled out a long fighting knife the namelesssailor had kept in the bottom of his trunk. She fastened the sheath to herwaist. The bout with the insidious poison had left her weak and incapacitated,but it had taught her a lesson. Even if she couldn’t use her magic, Nicci wouldnot let herself be unarmed. Never again.Using scraps of sailcloth, they fashioned makeshift packs to carry the salvagedsupplies. Just after the sun reached its zenith, the three set off down theexpansive beach.Around them, the headlands rose up in sheer sandy ledges dotted with tufts ofpampas grass and fleshy saltweed. They worked their way up to the point, fromwhich they paused to look out into the sparkling sea. Nicci saw no other sails,no approaching ships, not even the line of angry water that marked the reefsthat had destroyed the Wavewalker.“We must have been blown far south,” Nicci said, scanning back the way they hadcome. From Captain Eli’s maps, she thought they might be somewhere down on thePhantom Coast.In such an empty land devoid of any human markings, an artificial structurestood out like a shout. Bannon spotted it first with his sharp eyesight,pointing ahead across the windswept uplands to a promontory half a mile away onwhich stood a monolith of rocks, obviously built by people and just as obviouslyplaced there so it could be seen from afar.Squinting, Nathan said, “Without any frame of reference, it’s difficult to tellhow large the structure is.”Nicci set off. “We have to go see. It might give us our bearings, or point theway to some nearby town or military outpost.”Above the beach, the bleak, grassy emptiness played tricks on them, and thepromontory with its stone tower was much closer than it had seemed. As theyapproached, Bannon sounded disappointed. “It’s just a pile of rocks.”“A marker. A cairn—it’s to signal a waypoint,” Nathan said.The marker was a tower of neatly piled rocks, with the largest boulders aroundthe base stacked and wedged to form a solid foundation on which a thin, tallpyramid had been erected. The apex of the cairn was only a head taller thanNathan. Thick scrub grasses grew around its base, and orange and green lichenmottled the rough black surfaces of the mounded rocks. The rocks did not looklike any others in the vicinity.“Someone went to great difficulty to build this,” Nicci said. “It has obviouslybeen here a long time.”The wizard shaded his eyes and stared out into the sparkling ocean. “It might befor passing sailors. A point to mark on their maps. Or a signal tower … not thatwe could signal them anyway.” He sighed. “There isn’t enough brush to build adecent bonfire.”Nicci turned to him with a thin smile. “A ball of wizard’s fire hurled into theair might draw some attention.”Bannon circled the cairn, looking for any clues. He squatted down, brushingaside the lichen and moss. “Oh! Words are carved on these bottom stones,” hesaid, revealing chiseled letters. “It’s a message.”Nicci and Nathan came around to see the first stone, and Nicci froze. Theincised letters read, To Kol Adair.“Well.” Nathan rocked back, sounding pleased. “I suppose that is the waypoint wewere looking for.”Nicci’s chill deepened as she saw the rough, weathered words carved into thenext stone. From there, the Wizard will behold what he needs to make himselfwhole again.The words on the third stone made her throat go dry. And the Sorceress must savethe world.Nathan looked at her in astonishment. He lifted his hand, flexing his fingers.“Made whole again? Do you think it means I will be able to touch my Han again?Use magic? Red knew! She knew.”Nicci frowned, feeling a knot in her stomach. “Much as I hate to admit it, thislends credence to what the witch woman wrote.”Bannon was confused. “What? What is it? A prophecy?” He looked from one to theother.“Prophecy no longer exists,” Nicci said, but her insistence did not soundconvincing. Maybe if this prediction was old enough, burned into the fabric ofthe world before all the rules themselves changed …“I thought we were shipwrecked and lost,” Nathan said with a tone of wonder inhis voice. “Ironically, this debacle may have put us exactly where we weresupposed to go.”“I prefer to choose my own direction,” Nicci said, but she could not argue withthe evidence of her own eyes. She did not need a prophecy to help save the worldor to aid Richard Rahl in any way possible. And if she had to journey toward amysterious place called Kol Adair, then she would do it, as would Nathan.The wizard pursed his lips as he regarded the stones. “Only a fool tries toresist a clear prophecy. In doing so, the person usually brings about the samefate, but in a far worse fashion.”Nicci set off, leaving the cairn behind. “We go to Kol Adair, wherever it is,”she said.After the tall stone cairn dwindled in the distance, Nicci heard a loud crackand rumbling clatter in the windblown silence behind them. They all spun in timeto watch the spire of piled stones shifting and collapsing. The tallest rockscrumbled from the pinnacle, the center buckled, and the whole structurecollapsed into a mound of rocks. The cairn had served its purpose.* * *Leaving the high point, they descended the headlands, and came upon the bones ofa monster. A long skeleton sprawled among the rocks and weeds just above thehigh-tide line. Its head was the size of a wagon, a triangular skull withdaggerlike fangs and cavernous eye sockets. Its vertebrae draped along the rocksand down into the sand like a rope of bones as long as ten horses in a row.Innumerable curved ribs formed a long and broken tunnel that tapered to a pointat the creature’s tail.“It’s not a dragon,” Nathan observed.“Dragons are mostly extinct,” Nicci said.Bannon crossed his arms over his chest. “Sea serpent, but just a small one. Weoften saw them swimming past the Chiriya shore during mating season, when thekelp blooms.”Looking at the long skeleton, Nicci surmised that the creature had died out atsea, and the tides had cast its body up on shore, where gulls and otherscavengers picked it clean. Only a few iron-hard scraps of meat remained on thecurved bones. “If that is a small sea serpent, I’m glad the Wavewalker did notencounter one.”They walked along the beach until the tide came in with late afternoon. The sunlowered in a ruddy ball toward the expanse of water. The three trudged on,finding no path, no villages, no docks, nor even old campfire circles that wouldindicate a human presence. This land seemed wild, unsettled, unexplored.Bannon bounded off ahead, heading toward another large cliff that blocked theirway, pushing out into the sea. “Hurry, the tide is coming in, and it’ll blockour way. I’d rather walk along the beach than climb those cliffs.”They were sloshing in ankle-deep water by the time they rounded the point,climbing over seaweed-covered rocks. “This way,” Bannon said. “Be careful ofyour footing.”But when they came around the corner into a cove, the young man froze in place.He reached out to catch his balance on a tall rock.Nicci saw what had caught his attention. Another wrecked ship had been smashedlike a toy high up on the rocks. Little was left beyond a few ribs, some hullplanks, and the long keel. Time and weather had reduced it to skeletal remains.Nathan paused to catch his breath. “Now, that is interesting. What sort of shipis it?”The wreck’s curved prow was adorned by a ferocious carved serpent head—a seaserpent like the bones they had seen, Nicci realized. The hull planks wererough-hewn and lapped one over the top of the other, rather than being sealededge-to-edge as those of the more sophisticated Wavewalker had been. Several ofthe ship’s intact ribs curved up, draped with moss and seaweed. The rest of thehull had fallen apart.Nicci turned to Bannon, who looked as if he had seen an evil spirit. “Is thedesign familiar to you?”Too quickly, he shook his head. Nathan pressed, “Why are you shuddering, myboy?”“I’m just cold and tired.” He cleared his throat and trudged up on the rocks.“It’ll be dark soon. We should keep going and find a place to make camp.”Nicci looked around, made her decision. “This is a good enough spot. The cove issheltered, and that wreck is above the high-tide line. It’ll provide shelter.”“And ready firewood,” Nathan said.Bannon sounded uncertain. “But maybe if we kept going, we could find a village.”“Nonsense. This is much better than sleeping out in the windy headlands.” Nathanpicked his way closer to the ominous serpent ship. “It’ll all look better with anice roaring fire.” He began to gather shattered fragments of the planks forkindling.Nicci found a sheltered area in the curve of the ruined hull. “The sand is softhere. We can build a fire ring out of rocks.”Bannon sounded defeated. “I’ll go find us dinner. There’ll be crabs, shellfish,maybe some mussels in the tide pools.”He trotted off into the deepening twilight, while Nathan gathered scraps of woodand prepared a fire, but he had to rely on Nicci’s magic to ignite it. Soon,they had a large crackling blaze.After smoothing the sand for a decent cushion, the wizard situated himself onthe ground. Nicci dragged up a wave-polished log to use as a makeshift seat.Nathan propped his elbows on his knees and gazed into the cheerful bonfire,looking miserable. “I do not believe I’ve ever felt so weary and lost, even if Iknow we’re on our way to Kol Adair.”“We’ve endured a lot of hardship, Wizard. This is just more of it.” She poked astick into the flames.“I’m lost because my magic failed us when I needed it most. I’ve had the giftall my life. I wasted so many centuries locked in that dreadful palace,receiving prophecies and forced to write them down so that everyone couldmisinterpret them.” He snorted. “The Sisters had the best of intentions, buttheir results left much to be desired.”He shifted his position, but could not seem to find a comfortable spot to sit.“They considered me dangerous! Prophecy was integral to me, woven through myflesh and bone and blood, and when Richard sent the omen machine back to theunderworld, he unraveled that part of me.”“Richard did what was necessary,” Nicci said.“No doubt about that, Sorceress, and I’m not complaining.” He fumbled around inhis makeshift pack to withdraw the tortoiseshell comb he had claimed from theunnamed sailor’s trunk. He began to wrestle with the tangles, grimacing as hisunkempt hair fought against his efforts. “The world is a better place withoutthat damnable prophecy.”He held up his hand, concentrated, even squeezed his eyes shut, but nothinghappened. “But now I’m losing the rest of my magic. I haven’t been able to usemy gift properly since before the storm, before the selka. I have tried, but …nothing. How can that be, Sorceress?”“Are you asking if magic itself is going away, as did prophecy? I don’t see thecorrelation. My gift functions properly.” Then, as an afterthought, she added,“So long as I haven’t been poisoned.”“But I was a prophet and a wizard.” He looked at her with a flare in his azureeyes. “If the gift of prophecy unraveled within me, what if it was connected tothe rest of my gift? You can’t pluck one loose strand from a complex tapestrywithout unraveling other parts. Could it have disrupted my entire Han? Maybe byyanking out prophecy, Richard loosened other strands of interconnected magic.”He pushed his hands out toward the blaze, visibly straining. “What if I can’tcreate a light web ever again? Or manipulate water? Or make fire? Will I have toresort to doing card tricks, like a traveling charlatan? How can I be made wholeagain?”“I don’t have answers for you, Wizard,” Nicci said.He looked stung. “Maybe you won’t be able to call me that anymore.”Interrupting them, Bannon returned with an armload of misshapen oysters andmussels, which he dumped in the sand at the edge of the fire. “There were crabstoo, about the size of my hands,” the young man said. “I couldn’t carry themall, and the crabs tried to run away. I can go catch some later.”Nathan used a stick to push the shells into the coals, and the moisture hissedand spat as it steamed away. The mussels yawned open, gasping as they died.Bannon used a stick to fish them back out of the flames, rolling them onto thesand. “They cook quickly.”Nicci and Nathan each picked up one of the hot shellfish, juggling them in theirfingertips until they could pry the shells wide enough to get at the meatinside. After they devoured the entire haul, Bannon took a flaming brand fromthe fire and ventured into the darkness again. Before long, he returned withcrabs, which they also roasted.Squatting down on the smooth log near Nicci, Bannon laid his sword on his lapand ran his finger gently along the blade’s edge. He kept glancing around,deeply uneasy.At last having the chance to think and plan, Nicci gazed at the skeletalremnants of the wrecked serpent ship, then looked up into the sky to view thealtered constellations. “Tomorrow, we decide where to go.”Paying little attention to their discussion, Bannon tossed the empty shellsagainst the wooden ribs of the derelict ship.Nathan opened the leather satchel at his side, glad he still had his life book.It had mostly dried, and the blank pages suffered little enough damage. Using alead stylus he had procured in Tanimura, he began to sketch the coastline on oneof the blank pages.“I have no cartographic instruments, but I do have a good eye.” He added therocky points, the crescent-shaped beach, the site of the tall stone cairn, andnow the sheltered cove that held the wreck of the serpent ship. “It’s difficultto make an accurate map if you don’t know where you’re starting, but I’ll do mybest. After all, I am the roving ambassador, and Richard will want a map when wecome home again.” He worked his hands, concentrated, looked down at the pages,then sighed in disappointment. “A map-making spell could do a much better job,but this will serve.”Nicci said, “At least that book provides blank paper. It is not entirelyuseless.”Nathan sat up straight as a thought occurred to him. He looked at Nicci andextended a finger. “The witch woman wasn’t useless. She knew we had to be here.You had to be here.”“Yes, to save the world, to save Richard’s empire. I’m sure it will all becomeclear enough … once we find someone to ask.”Bannon looked up at them. “So if we find a place called Kol Adair, you’ll getyour magic back? And the sorceress will save the world.”“Yes!” Nathan said, then frowned. “Possibly. Or maybe it’s just a foolish, vagueprediction that has no merit at all.”Nicci added, “No one can be certain of anything a witch woman says. And prophecyno longer exists.”“Do we have another choice? We’re here anyway. You and I came to explore the OldWorld. That quest seemed pointless before, but it is more important now.”“Then we will go to Kol Adair,” Nicci said as she went to stand at the edge oftheir firelight, “as soon as we have any idea where to find it.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 20 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch20]Bannon did not sleep well, despite the shelter of the cove and the familiarlullaby of the surf. Restless, he fought against swirling thoughts of all thathad happened in the past few days, and fears of what might lie ahead.Since he was awake, he volunteered to keep watch, brooding through the darkesthours of the night. He jumped at every sound in the darkness, fearing thatburly, ruthless men would stride up the beach to seize him, to gag and bind him.But it was just his imagination … his memories.While the beautiful sorceress slept on the sand not far from Nathan, Bannoncalled upon peace, reshaped the world the way he wanted it to be, and fashioneda contented smile for himself. The wizard looked unsettling as he lay near thewaning fire, sound asleep but with his eyes open. Near dawn, though, his eyelidsfluttered closed.The young man roused his companions as morning light edged the high headlands.He was amazed at how instantly Nicci came awake without yawning or stretching.She rose to her feet, her blue eyes bright and alert, her expression clear asshe absorbed her surroundings in a flash. She brushed sand off her black dress,and despite all the ordeals, didn’t look at all rumpled; that in itself seemedlike sorcery to Bannon.He’d been infatuated with pretty girls on Chiriya, but Nicci was unlike anywoman he had ever met. She was more beautiful and intelligent than the youngisland women, but it was more than that. She seemed fascinating, but alsodangerous. Bannon flushed with embarrassment when she caught him staring ather—and she stared right back, but with an expression that carried littlewarmth.They set off into the wilderness together. After leaving the small cove behind,Bannon let out a silent sigh of relief to be away from the wreck of the ominousNorukai ship.…“The beach gets rockier farther on,” Nicci said, scanning south along the shore.“We’d better travel inland.”The wizard agreed. “That is where we’d likely encounter some settlement, sincewe haven’t seen any docks or boats on this section of the coast.”“I’ll find a way for us to climb up,” Bannon volunteered. Scouting ahead at hisown pace, he picked a feasible route, zigzagging up the crumbling sandstonecliffs. The other two followed him, hand over foot, and together they reachedthe open, windy flats above the surf.The breeze was sharp and chilly, and thin clouds scudded across the sky. Thetall pampas grass and low vegetation rippled as if some invisible stampedecharged across the flatland. Dark green cypress trees hunched against theconstant gale, their tufted branches pointed in the direction of the prevailingwinds.Nathan and Nicci discussed their plans, but the rustling breezes snatched theirwords from Bannon’s hearing as he scouted ahead. He was reluctant—or perhaps notbrave enough—to make small talk with the beautiful sorceress. He wanted to hearwhere Nicci had grown up, if she’d had a perfect life, a peaceful upbringing,loving parents. Bannon didn’t need to know—didn’t want to know, actually. Hejust made it so in his own mind.When Nathan startled a black-winged tern from a matted clump of grass, the oldwizard bent down. “Ah, look, a nest—and better yet, three eggs.” He cradled themin his palms. “This can supplement our breakfast.”Bannon came back, feeling his stomach growl. “Eggs? Are we going to make a newcook fire?” They had only been traveling for an hour.Nicci took the eggs from Nathan’s hands. “No need to stop. Let me.” She wrappedher fingers around them, and Bannon saw tendrils of steam rise up. Withinmoments she handed him one of the eggs, and the shell was so hot that he had tojuggle it in his hands. “We can eat as we walk,” Nicci said. “We have a longdistance to cover—even if we don’t know where we’re going.”Nathan finished his breakfast and tossed the crumbled eggshell to the ground. Hedry-washed his hands and rubbed them on his pants.From the outstretched headlands they could see the coastline snaking southwardfor miles. The hills inland were covered with dark pines and silver-leavedeucalyptus with peeling bark.The three maintained a steady pace, and the wizard called to Bannon, “If you seeany more signposts pointing the way to Kol Adair, my boy, be sure you let usknow.”Bannon cheerfully agreed, then realized Nathan was just teasing him. But was itsuch an unlikely possibility?He ranged ahead, foraging, and wound his way through the bent cypress trees,then explored the stands of pine and the spicy-smelling eucalyptus. Seeing nosign of human habitation, the young man wondered if they were the first humanbeings to set foot on this untamed land. It felt wonderful, and it feltterrifying at the same time.Chiriya Island had been settled for countless generations. The people grew theircabbages and set out in their fishing boats, and the only excitement was theoccasional trading ship that tied up in the small harbor. He had long pretendedthat his younger years were perfect, with every neighbor waving a hearty hello,everyone chipping in to help one another, the weather always sunny, food on thetable, a fire in the hearth on even the coldest winter nights.He had left that place … a place that never really existed.He was robbed in the dark alleys of Tanimura. He fought bloodthirsty selka andsaw his shipmates slaughtered, certain that he, too, would die that night. Buthe had survived the Wavewalker being shipwrecked on an unknown shore. He hadleft Chiriya for this, had left his father’s hard fists and drunken shouts, hadleft the blood. And the kittens …Bannon winced at the memories. He brushed aside tall, brittle blades of pampasgrass, walked around a hummock, and ducked into a rustling tangle of cypressthat offered shelter from the wind. Even with the fearful ordeals, this wasbetter than Chiriya. Far better.Exploring by himself, he entered the forest. He heard the chuckle of a creekflowing through the pines to a beautiful round pool with a smooth sandy bottom.He saw the silvery flashes of small fish darting around, evading his shadow.Bannon knelt in the weeds and flowers on the edge of the pond and scoopedhandfuls of the cold, clear water, drinking his fill. Fresh water!He studied the darting fish, but they were much too small to bother with. Ahandful would barely make a meal, even if he could catch them. The water,though, was pure and delicious. He filled his waterskin and ducked out of thepines and eucalyptus into the brisk wind again.Now that he had shaken his darker memories, Bannon felt light-footed as hecontinued to explore. Yes, he had suffered terrible hardships, but he would makethe best of his situation. He reminded himself that he had left Chiriyaintending to seek adventure—and he had found exactly that. A small, shadowedpart of him acknowledged that he had fled his island in shock and denial at whathad happened … but he drove those thoughts away again, blinking his eyes andlooking at the bright world. He drew another clean breath.“I am not running away—I am exploring!” he said aloud with enough force toconvince himself. He was in an unknown land with a great wizard as his mentor, aman who taught him history and swordplay. And there was the mysterious andbeautiful sorceress Nicci, who intruded more and more into his thoughts. Hecould not help but be attracted to her.As he roamed the grassy headlands, he headed back toward the cliff edge to watchthe white waves roll in. He wondered who Nicci was, what drove her. Did shethink about him, too? Bannon pondered what he could do to make her notice him,to consider him a worthwhile traveling companion, instead of just a coincidentalone.Bannon peered over the verge and watched rooster tails of spray leap into theair. A flash of color caught his attention, wedged into the mossy sandstone justdown the cliff, and he knelt to see a clump of unusual flowers growing withinarm’s reach. The blossoms were vibrant, the deepest and most intense violet hehad ever seen, shot through with veins of crimson and a central splash of yellowstamens. They had thick fleshy stems and swordlike green leaves.The beautiful flowers gave him an idea, a perfect idea. Beautiful flowers for abeautiful woman!Bannon stretched out, extending his arm over the edge to reach the blossoms. Hepicked four of them—a bouquet. It was a small gesture, but perhaps Nicci wouldbe grateful. Perhaps she would notice him.He bounded back through the grasses, searching for his companions, and he waspanting hard by the time he caught up with them. The breezes blew his gingerhair wildly around his head as he hurried up to Nicci.When he extended the flowers, all his suave words were snatched from his mouthas if the wind had stolen them. He could only manage to blurt, “I found thesefor you.”She frowned with a glimmer of annoyance, but when she looked at the flowers, herexpression filled with interest. She narrowed her blue eyes and reached out totake one of the flowers from his bouquet, leaving him with the other three. Sheshowed extreme care as she touched the stem with just her fingertips.Bannon waited for her to smile with delight or nod in warm appreciation. Hecouldn’t remember whether he had ever seen her respond with a genuine smile.“Where did you find these?” she demanded.“Over by the cliff.” He pointed. “Growing in a cranny in the rock.”“Such flowers are rare. I could have made use of them many times.” She lookedover at Nathan.The wizard’s eyes were wide with recognition. “Do you know what those are,Bannon Farmer?”“Pretty flowers?”“Deathrise flowers,” Nicci said, studying the one in her hand.Bannon looked at the rest of his bouquet, confused.“Deathrise flowers,” she repeated. “One of the most dangerous plants inexistence. They are extremely hard to find, and valuable. Assassins would pay aking’s ransom for these four. But this is far more than we could ever use.” Sheheld up the stem in her hand. “One will be more than sufficient.”“What—what do you mean?” Looking down at the violet-and-crimson flowers, he felthis skin crawl.“Do you expect to kill an entire city, my boy?” Nathan asked. “Or maybe just avillage?”Bannon blinked, still trying to grasp what they were telling him. “You meanthey’re … poison?”Nicci’s face smoothed in a fascinated smile as she rolled the thick stem in herfingers, careful not to touch the broken end. “The deathrise flower has manyuses. From the petals one can concoct an ink so lethal that any victim who readsa message written with such ink will die a painful, lingering death. Consumingeven one seed causes a horrible agony that has been described as swallowingmouthfuls of glass shards, then regurgitating them, and swallowing them all overagain.”Bannon’s stomach twisted into a knot. “I—I didn’t mean…”Nicci continued, “Tinctures, extracts, and potions can be made from all parts ofthe deathrise flower. Emperor Jagang had his alchemists and apothecaries testthe various mixtures on his prisoners of war.” She raised her eyebrows. “Aboutfive thousand died in those preliminary experiments. The camps for the testsubjects became known as the Places of Screaming. Emperor Jagang pitched histent nearby so he could drift off to sleep listening to that music.”Bannon felt sick. He stood trembling, looked down at the other three deathriseflowers in his hand, afraid to move his fingers.“Even touching the juice to your skin will cause rashes and boils to break out.”Nicci looked at the single flower she had kept, obviously impressed although notin the way Bannon had wanted. “I thank you very much. One never knows when suchmeasures might be required.” She wrapped the flower carefully in a scrap ofcloth and tucked it into her pack. “I am pleased with how you think.”Embarrassment—and the fear that his hands and arms were about to burst intoleper’s sores or swollen boils—rendered him speechless. He turned and boltedheadlong into the wind, running toward the pine trees, intent on reaching thepond and the stream again. When he reached the weeds of the shore he flung thedeathrise flowers as far as he could out into the water, then dropped to hisknees, plunged his hands into the pond, and dug his fingers into the sand. Hescrubbed and scrubbed his palms, his fingers, the backs of his hands, hiswrists, all the way up his arms. He frantically tried to remember any place hehad touched with the deathrise flower. He filled his cupped palms, and was aboutto splash water in his face, but he didn’t dare go near his mouth or eyes.Even when his hands looked clean, he plunged them into the sand again, scrubbingand scrubbing. He scoured his skin a third time and a fourth, until even hisfingertips were raw, his palms pink, his knuckles sore. Finally, he steppedaway, breathing hard, still afraid that the poison had gotten inside him.He swallowed. What more could he do? He would find no antidote here … if anantidote even existed.Heart pounding, pulse racing, he struggled to regain his composure. Finally, heleft the pond and ran to catch up with Nicci and Nathan.* * *At dusk, four dwarf deer crept out of the eucalyptus forest where they hadrested in the tangled shadows throughout the day. They ventured forth, theirdelicate hooves stepping on twigs while they worked their way along a faint gametrail.Though there were few large predators here on the coastal headlands, the deerpossessed natural caution on their journey to the freshwater pond where theydrank each night at sunset. The deer approached the shore, uncertain andskittish. They took several steps, then paused, their ears flickering to detectany threat, then moved forward again. One hung back as a sentinel while theother three stepped to the pond’s edge.The deer sensed something amiss. The water was smooth and clear as always, butthey noticed, without comprehension, the glimmering silver shapes that driftedon the surface of the pond. Hundreds of the small fish that had darted likesmall mirror flashes in the last sunlight now floated belly-up like a stain onthe water.The deer struggled to understand what had changed. Frozen like statues in theforest, they waited for long minutes, but nothing approached, nothing attacked.Finally, one of the deer dipped into the water and drank. The next two joinedher, drinking their fill. When it was his turn, the sentinel buck also drank,and the twilight shadows deepened around them.…By the next morning numerous fish still drifted on the surface, though some ofthe bodies had begun to sink. On the shore, four dwarf deer also lay dead."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 21 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch21]They camped in the shelter of thick cypress. During the night, the maddening,mournful breezes died down, which allowed a thick fog to settle in. The cold wetswaths made the three miserable while they huddled near a small fire, addingmore moist twigs in an attempt to keep the blaze going. Nicci used her magic tomaintain the fire, but the flames gave out too little heat.Nicci had never been overly concerned with her personal comfort, so long as shecould function. Now that they’d been shipwrecked on the unknown coast, despitethe unexpected rock cairn reaffirming their destination of Kol Adair, she couldnot guess how many miles they might need to walk before they found a settlementin this wild coastal wasteland.Despite the solitude, Nicci reminded herself that this land, bleak and untamedas it was, was now part of the D’Haran Empire. Nicci was doing what she hadpromised Lord Rahl, and she would, in fact, walk from one end of the world tothe other for him, if that proved necessary. But neither she nor Nathan couldcontinue their quest until they actually found a village or city.Finally, morning brightened the murk, and Nicci stopped wasting effort to keepthe useless fire going. “We should get moving. That will generate heat.”Nathan used the tortoiseshell comb to untangle his long white hair. “I don’tknow if even running will keep us warm enough.” He looked in disappointment athis moist and rumpled shirt. “I never realized how many ways I relied on mygift. A little internal magic could always keep me warm on a blustery, miserableday like this.”Nicci shouldered her makeshift pack. “We won’t be any colder than we are now,and at least we’ll cover distance.”Bannon squinted into the fog. “But can we see where we’re going?”“We’ll see when we get there,” Nicci said.Nathan tucked away his life book in the leather pouch and fastened the flap. “Idoubt I can add much detail to my map today.”They headed out. Guided by the rush and boom of the ocean off to their right,they walked far enough from the edge to stay safe. “I’m not so much worriedabout falling off a cliff, as I am of reaching the edge of the world,” Bannonsaid, panting. “Then we would just fall forever.”Nathan lifted his bushy eyebrows. “You believe we’ll find the actual edge of theworld, my boy?”“I’ve seen maps that cut off.…”“If we find the edge of the world, then we will know that we’ve come to theboundaries of Lord Rahl’s empire.” Nicci did not waste time or effort worryingabout such things. “Then we will turn and explore in a different direction.”“I hope we find Kol Adair before then,” Nathan said.Ever since offering her the deathrise flowers, the young man had seemed subdued.Before she rebuffed him, Nicci had noted the bright gleam in his eyes,recognizing that he was probably smitten with her—and those feelings werewoefully misplaced. His imagination was already too active.Nathan had a certain fondness for the young man. Despite the thousand-yeardifference in their ages, the two had much in common, since even the old wizardhad a flash of naiveté about him.The fog thinned for an hour as they continued, but the chill deepened. Bannonshivered. “Maybe we should go inland to the thicker forest, where at least thetrees will shelter us.”Nicci shook her head and kept going. She walked in a straight, determined line,defeating the distance as if it were an enemy. “If we follow the coastline,we’ll be more likely to discover a river outlet or a port. And we can seefarther ahead, once the fog clears.”Nathan kept his eyes to the ground, preoccupied with finding berry bushes, wildonions, or bird’s nests and breakfast eggs. Bannon ranged ahead like a dutifulscout.The wind went quiet again and the fog closed in, so that Nicci didn’t see theyoung man until he was right beside her. He looked sheepish, smiling for thefirst time since the debacle of offering her deathrise flowers. This time,Bannon held a handful of orange lilies on long stalks. “I found these for you,Sorceress. I hope you like them better than those poison blossoms.”Nicci regarded him coolly. “But I valued the deathrise flower. I told you ingreat detail about all its uses.”“These are pretty flowers, though,” Bannon said, extending them toward her.“Grass lilies. They used to grow all over Chiriya. They won’t last long afterthey’ve been picked, but I wanted you to have them.” When Nicci did not reachout to accept them, his expression faltered. “Are they not to your liking?”She recognized that Bannon Farmer was competent enough, and he had proven hismettle in fighting the selka. She would let him accompany her for as long as sheconsidered him useful, or at least not a hindrance. She could imagine far worsecompany, but she had to nip his infatuation in the bud.She realized that her response to his clumsy offering yesterday had not been asufficient rebuff. She had to set him straight, or she would have to kill himsooner or later.Nicci recalled all the times she’d been abused, forced to spend weeks withJagang’s soldiers as a plaything for their sadistic enjoyment, as well as thetimes when Jagang had taken her himself, sometimes beating her bloody. With hertwisted experience of so-called love, she had convinced herself she was in lovewith Richard Rahl. Back then, she had been a Sister of the Dark, corrupted byher service to the Keeper as well as her brutal enslavement by the emperor. Herattempt to express that misguided love for Richard—forcing him to live a falselife with her as man and wife—had only made Richard resent her more.Nicci had eventually learned her lesson. She herself had killed Jagang, and nowshe served Richard wholeheartedly, in her own way. She knew that she did loveRichard, that he was the only man she could love … but it was a different kindof love now. He had Kahlan, and he would never be satisfied with Nicci, not inthat way, no matter how much he respected and valued her. Because of heriron-hard devotion, Nicci had made up her mind to conquer the Old World forRichard Rahl—single-handedly if necessary.She had no time or patience for a young mooncalf who thought she was pretty.Bannon beamed when Nicci reached toward the flowers, but instead of acceptingthem, she wrapped her grip around his wrist. Clenching tight, she released awarning flow of magic that sent a sharp tingle into his flesh like a hailstormof steel needles.His hazel eyes widened, and his mouth gaped open in shock. Before the young mancould say anything, Nicci spoke through gritted teeth. “I am only letting youstay with us because Nathan likes you, and because you may be useful in helpingus get where we need to go. But know this”—she lowered her voice to a growl—“Iam not some fawning village girl looking for a stolen kiss.”His fingers spasmed and he let the lilies fall to the ground. Nicci didn’t evenglance at them. She maintained her tight grip on his arm.“I’m—I’m sorry, Sorceress!”She had to drive the point home, so that the problem did not occur again. Shedidn’t soften her voice at all. “We face serious problems. We are lost, and wemust find out where we are in order to continue our mission. If you ever get inmy way, I will skin you alive without a second thought.”He gawked at her with just the proper amount of terror and dismay, which wouldresolve itself into appropriate respect soon enough. She would not need to worryabout this nonsense from him again.She let go of his wrist, and Bannon flexed his hand, flapping it as if to flingaway the pain. He stammered, “But—but … I only—”She had no wish to be part of his starry-eyed view of the world or his nostalgiafor a peaceful island home. “I’ve heard the stories you tell yourself. I am notpart of your perfect boyhood. Do you understand me, child?” She used the lastword intentionally.His fearful expression suddenly darkened, as if she had torn the scab off astill-festering wound. “It wasn’t perfect. It was never perfect.” Lookingashamed, he turned away to find Nathan standing there with a concerned andcompassionate look on his face.Nicci didn’t interfere as the wizard put a comforting hand on Bannon’s shoulder.“Best you understand the way of things, my boy. Remember, she was called Death’sMistress.”Bannon walked away, his expression downcast. Heading off into the thickeningmist, he said, “No. I will never forget that.”The fog melted around him."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 22 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch22]After they traveled for three more days, the headlands shifted to forested hillsand fertile grasslands. Bannon nervously kept his distance from Nicci and spenteven more time with the wizard. Though she spoke no more of the incident, Nicciwas inwardly relieved that he had learned his lesson.She heard Nathan telling the young man tidbits of history or ruminating abouthis time locked in the Palace of the Prophets. Some of the legends soundedabsurd to Nicci, as did events in the wizard’s own life, but Bannon had nofilter to determine what might or might not be true. He lapped up each ofNathan’s tales like a cat facing a bowl of cream. At least it kept the twooccupied as they trudged along, which Nathan did his best to document on therudimentary map in his life book.On the fifth day, they came upon a path that was too wide and well traveled tobe a game trail. Ahead, they saw stumps where trees had been cut down.Bannon cried out, “That means people have been here!”The trail soon widened into a footpath, then an actual road. Coming over a rise,they could see the hills spilling down to a neat, rounded bay into which anarrow river drained. A large village of wooden homes, shops, and warehouses hadsprung up on both sides of the river. A high wooden bridge joined the two banks.Piers thrust into the water, providing docks for small boats in the bay. A pointof rocky land swooped around the far end of the harbor, punctuated with alookout tower.The hills held terraced gardens and pastures where sheep and cattle grazed. Downby the docks, people were unloading a catch from the fishing boats. Stretchednets hung on frameworks drying in the sun. High on the beach, five overturnedboats were being repaired by shipwrights.“I was beginning to think we’d have to walk around the entire world,” Nathansaid.Nicci nodded. “We’ll find out where we are, and choose our next course. We caninform them of Lord Rahl’s rule, and maybe someone here can tell us where tofind Kol Adair.”“I assume you are anxious to save the world, Sorceress,” Nathan said. “Asanxious as I am to be made whole again.”Nicci’s mouth formed a hard, straight line. “I will reserve judgment on just howseriously to take the witch woman’s words.”Nathan frowned down at his shirt, disappointed by the now limp and ruinedruffles of the garment he had purchased in Tanimura less than two weeks earlier.“At the very least, a town that size should have a tailor who can replace myclothes. I hate to feel so … scruffy.”Considering how barren the lands had been in their journey from the north, Nicciwondered how often these people saw strangers. When she noticed other roadsleading upriver, as well as the fishing boats and the substantial harbor, sherealized that they must have contact with other settled areas—just not from thewilderness up the Phantom Coast.On the outskirts of town, the road took them past a cemetery on the hillside,where grave markers covered the slopes. Names had been chiseled into the lowstone markers, while other graves were marked only by wooden posts with namescarved into the wood. These flimsier posts were arranged much too closely tomark individual burial sites. Seeing the wooden posts and stone markers, Bannonseemed very disturbed.Nathan ran his fingers down the weathered wood, where the name was all butunreadable. “I assume the two types of markers indicate a class system? Thewealthy can afford fine stone markers and a spacious grave, while those lessfortunate are simply marked with a post?”“Maybe there are no bodies at all because there were no bodies to bury,” Niccisaid. “Fishermen lost at sea, for instance.”Bannon looked gray. “I think they are memorials for people who are not dead, butare gone.”Nathan’s brow furrowed. “Gone? What do you mean by that, my boy?”“Maybe they were … taken.” The young man swallowed hard.Nicci turned to give him a hard look. “Taken by whom?”His voice came out in a whisper. “Slavers, possibly.”The idea troubled Nicci, and she led the way at a faster, more determined pace.Slavers had no place in Lord Rahl’s new rule, and Nicci looked forward toputting the matter to rest. One way or another.When they reached the outskirts of the town, children playing in the dirtstreets noticed the three travelers coming from the unexpected direction andcalled excitedly for their parents. Stout women worked at their washing, whiletwo older couples sat together mending fishing nets that were stretched acrosswooden benches. Men and women working in the vegetable patches and farm fieldslooked up to see the strangers.Nathan shook trail dust and sand from his pants and shirt, frowning at himself.“I don’t make a very formidable presence as the roving ambassador for D’Hara.”He tapped the sword in its scabbard at his hip. “But at least my fine bladeshows me to be a man of some note.”Bannon put his hand on the leather-wrapped hilt of his own sword, but couldn’tseem to think of what to say.Nicci cautioned them both. “We won’t be drawing our swords unless there’s aneed. We come bearing word that the Old World is now at peace. They will be gladto hear it.”A middle-aged woman with brown hair tied in a thick braid raised a hand inwelcome. A ten-year-old boy at her side stared at the newcomers as if they weremonsters from the sea. “They came from the north!” he said, pointing vigorously.“There’s nothing up to the north.”“Welcome to Renda Bay,” said the woman. “You look as if you’ve had a longjourney.”“We were shipwrecked,” Nicci said.“We’ve been walking for days,” Bannon interjected. “We’re glad we found yourvillage.”“Renda Bay?” Nathan said. “I’ll mark it on my map.”As more people gathered, Nicci assessed the modest homes, wooden commonbuildings, gardens and flowerbeds. The children did not look shabby, gaunt, ordesperate. Much of the activity in the town had to do with cleaning fish inlarge troughs at wooden tables down by the docks. Iron racks loaded with fishfilets hung over smoky kelp fires. Rows of broad basins were lined along thebeach under the sun, filled with seawater that would slowly evaporate to leave aresidue of valuable salt.The villagers peppered them with questions. Nathan and Bannon told disjointedparts of their story, and the noise of conversation swelled around them. Nicciinterrupted, “Call a gathering, and we will address everyone at once, so wedon’t have to repeat ourselves.”They met the town leader, a man named Holden, who was in his late thirties, withrich brown hair marked by a distinctive frosting of white at the temples. Theylearned that until recently he had owned his own fishing boat before he devotedhis days to local administration.Holden led them to the town square, where many eager people had already gatheredto hear the strangers’ tale. Nicci let Nathan speak, because the wizard wasquite comfortable with the sound of his own voice. “I am Nathan Rahl, currentlythe representative of Lord Richard Rahl of the D’Haran Empire, the man whodefeated Emperor Jagang.” He looked at them, as if expecting cheers. “You mayhave been wondering why you are no longer under the crushing boot heel of theImperial Order?”The villagers’ expressions did not show terror or even awareness. Holden said,“We’ve heard of Jagang, but it’s been three decades or more since we saw troopsor any representative from the Imperial Order.”Bannon interjected, “We were on a ship that sailed south from Tanimura—theWavewalker under Captain Eli Corwin—but we were attacked by selka. Hundreds ofthem, maybe thousands! They killed our crew, and our ship ran aground on thereefs. Only the three of us survived. You’re the first people we’ve seen since.”Many listeners stared at them in horror and fascination, while others frownedwith clear skepticism, as if they expected castaways to embellish their stories.Nicci interrupted, “The important news we bring you is that Lord Rahl hasoverthrown the evil tyrants, and that you are all free. You need not fearoppression, slavery, or tyranny. As he consolidates his empire, Lord Rahl isgathering emissaries so that all may decide a common set of laws to whicheveryone must agree. This will be a golden age for human history.” She crossedher arms over her chest. “And you are part of it.”Nathan brightened as he looked out at the villagers. “You must have maps. Youmust know the area. Choose several of your best people to travel north, makeyour way up to the New World, the heart of D’Hara and the People’s Palace, soyou can join Lord Rahl. He’ll provide the protection and support your villageneeds. Now is a very important time for the building of the new empire.”Holden had a habit of nodding sincerely, demonstrating that he listened topeople when they expressed their concerns, but he didn’t appear convinced. “Thatis heartening news, and I am proud to hear what your Lord Rahl hasaccomplished.” He gestured to the gathered audience. “Our people here trade withvillages upriver and larger cities to the south, but we have barely heard ofD’Hara or Tanimura. It’s grand for you to say that we are free of tyranny andslavery … but has everyone who would threaten us also heard this news?”“They will,” Nicci said.He spread his hands, sounding perfectly reasonable. “Your Lord Rahl is too faraway to have any real effect in our lives. How could any D’Haran help us fromthe other side of the world? We are on our own here … against whatever mightprey on us.”“He will be able to protect you,” Nicci said. She knew well enough not tounderestimate Richard.Holden gave them a conciliatory smile and did not argue further. “Still, it isgood to know, and you are welcome in Renda Bay. We will help you as we can,since you seem to have lost everything.”“We could use a good meal,” Nathan said. “And new clothes.” He pulled up hisfrayed sleeve. “Do you have a tailor? I require several new outfits.”“We would also appreciate supplies and provisions,” Nicci said, “before wecontinue our journey. We are looking for a place called Kol Adair.”The people didn’t immediately show any sign of recognition, but they offered tohelp in any way possible. As conversation buzzed in the square, Holden declared,“We’ll have a welcoming dinner tonight. Because of the season, our boats justbrought in a fine catch of redfins. We can roast enough for a banquet.”Nathan smiled. “We appreciate your hospitality, and we would dearly enjoy a goodmeal. Now, from whom might I request a new shirt?”* * *That night, the villagers set up long plank tables in an open festival area justabove the docks in the harbor. A warm, cheery glow came from the windows of thevillage dwellings, and tall torches surrounded the gathering. Candle potsflickered along the wooden bridge that crossed the narrow river.As dusk descended, people came for the welcome feast. Fat redfin fish, seasonedwith sea salt and pungent herbs, roasted over coals in fire pits. The meal wasaccompanied with tubers boiled in large cauldrons, and a salad made of bitterflowers.Nicci found the redfin to be a dark, meaty fish with a strong flavor. Bannon hada second helping as he talked with his companions at the long table. To theirgreat fascination, he described the many dishes that could be made with cabbage.Nathan had obtained a new shirt, a gray homespun tunic that laced up the front.The old wizard found the color unflattering, but he agreed that it was farsuperior to the remnants of his once fine clothes. “Thank you so much, my dearJann,” he said to a short, dark-haired woman with plain features but prettyeyes. She was one of the town’s seamstresses who spun her own cloth and madegarments for her family and others.“My last tailors in Tanimura had numerous patterns and styles to choose from,countless grades of fabric, endless cuts.” Nathan heaved a sigh. “But theyweren’t nearly as pretty or as kind as you.”Jann giggled. “You should thank my husband. That shirt was supposed to be forPhillip.” A broad-shouldered older man sat next to her. Nearly as tall asNathan, he had tightly curled dark hair and a rugged face. When Nathan asked himabout the scar across his nose, he explained that a fishhook had once cut himdown to the cartilage when a line had snapped.“I have plenty of shirts, and you obviously need that one more than I,” saidPhillip. “And now I can boast that the ambassador for Lord Rahl wears clothesmade by my wife.” His big callused hand clasped Jann’s much more delicate hand.He savored another bite of redfin. “It’s good to feast on fish I didn’t have tobring in myself. Those days are over for me.”Jann explained, “Phillip is a successful fisherman, but he prefers to be a boatbuilder. We’ve just set up a new dry dock, and he’ll be repairing fishingvessels and building a new one to sell.”Phillip smiled proudly. “A new one that I plan to name the Lady Jann.”“That is sure to increase the asking price,” said Nathan.Town leader Holden stood up in the middle of the meal, and the dinner chatterdied down. “We welcome our visitors from far-off lands. We give what we can andhope that the Sea Mother remembers our kindness to strangers.”While the villagers cheered and toasted, Nicci heard some of the villagersmuttering, as if they thought the Sea Mother had let them down many times in thepast. She realized that Renda Bay had no armed guards, no strong militarypresence, no defenses whatsoever. Nicci knew that if one relied on etherealdeities to solve problems, then those problems usually remained unsolved.Suddenly, several villagers stood up from the plank tables, gesturing toward thedark harbor. A bright warning fire sprang from the watchtower on the southernpoint of the breakwater. Someone threw a torch into a pile of dry wood, whichswelled into a blazing beacon. When Holden saw the fire, his face fell into anexpression of dread.Looking out into the harbor, Nicci could see the ominous silhouettes of fourlarge, dark ships that closed in on the bay with unnatural speed.Holden looked at Nicci with a sick expression. “Where is your Lord Rahl’sprotection now?”Nicci straightened. “I’m here.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 23 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch23]Villagers bolted in panic from the outside festival area. Some ran to theirhomes to seize knives, clubs, bows, and anything else they could use as aweapon. Nathan and Bannon both drew their swords and stood together next to theplank feasting tables, although the young man’s expression was far differentfrom what Nicci had seen on his face when he fought the selka. This time, helooked disgusted as well as terrified.The massive dark ships slid forward swiftly even though the night was withoutbreezes. Each vessel had one mast with a single broad sail dyed a deep blue, soas to be invisible at night.Nicci heard splashing sounds and the gruff shouts of men. Peering intensely intothe night, she enhanced her vision with an obscure distance spell, which let hersee that the four invading ships were propelled by long lines of oars. The oarscut into the water like axe blades and swept back to push the vessel forward,then lifted into the air dripping moonlight, and stabbed the water again.Bannon’s voice cracked. “Norukai slavers!”“Norukai slavers,” Holden echoed, then added his own shout. “Prepare to defendyourselves! It’s another raid.”“What is it, my boy?” Nathan asked. “Who are they?”“Nightmares.”The slaver ships came in fast, crushing a small fishing boat as they ground upagainst the Renda Bay piers. A chorus of guttural, challenging shouts came fromthe longboats. With a chill, Nicci saw that each of the four curved prowssported the monstrous carving of a sea serpent, and she recognized the designfrom the crumbling wreck they had found in the sheltered cove on their firstnight ashore.The four raider ships careened like rampaging bulls into the harbor. Brightorange streaks soared into the sky from the longboat decks, arced downward, andscattered upon the village, striking streets, rooftops, and unfortunatetownspeople. Several fire arrows stuck into the lapped roofs of the houses andset the buildings on fire.Water crews raced with buckets to stop the conflagration from spreading, whilethe rest of the defenders converged toward the docks, carrying whatever weaponsthey had. But even at a glance, Nicci could see that the villagers could neverdrive off such an aggressive raid. By her guess, the four Norukai ships heldnearly three hundred warriors. She turned to Nathan. “It is up to us to fightthem.”He raised his sword. “My thoughts exactly, Sorceress.”Releasing magic, Nicci ignited a bright fireball in her hand and tossed it intothe air, where it expanded, growing more diffuse until it exploded high overheadlike a wash of chain lightning. The glow illuminated the big serpent ships andthe raiders boiling off the decks. The nearest two vessels crashed against thepiers and fastened with iron hooks and heavy planks, while the raiders from theouter two vessels dropped smaller boats into the water and rowed toward theshore.Jann and her husband Phillip accompanied Nathan as they braced themselves forthe attack. Jann cried, “Spirits save us!”“I will save you,” Nicci said.The wizard turned to the retired fisherman. “Are your people at war with theNorukai? Why do they attack Renda Bay?”“We are prey to them,” said Phillip, his face haggard. “Normally, they dart inwith a single boat, snatch five to ten victims, and flee into the night. Butthis … this is a full invasion.”“Then we arrived just in time,” Nicci said.Norukai warriors thundered across the docks, rushing to the village, whileothers jumped out of landing boats and sloshed up from the shallow water toshore, carrying clubs, ropes, and nets.The sorcerous illumination dissipated overhead, but Nicci’s magic swelled. Shestretched her mind in one direction, tapping into Additive Magic and the energythere, while she also drew upon Subtractive Magic. Combining both, she conjuredjagged lashes of black lightning, which she whipped against the first threeinvaders who reached the end of the docks. Her lightning ripped their broadchests into smoking wreckage, and the burly men collapsed into a heap of bones.Despite this unexpected attack, the slavers showed no hint of fear or evencaution. They charged forward, sneering at her lightning, arrogant in theirinvincibility. A team of four left their landing boats and waded to the beach.Nicci killed the next wave of them as well.The Norukai were squat men with disproportionately broad shoulders, shavedheads, and bare arms, and they wore vests of scaled armor made of some reptileskin. Most horrific, their cheeks had been slit from the corners of their lipsback to the hinge of the jaw, then sewn up again, as if to widen their mouthslike a snake’s. Now, as they roared their fearsome battle call, their jawsopened wide, as if they were vipers about to strike. Only a few Norukai carriedswords or spears, while the rest obviously expected to subdue and capture theirvictims, not to kill. They meant to harvest the people of Renda Bay.A second rain of flaming arrows launched from the deck of a Norukai ship,pelting the village. By now several healthy fires were spreading among thewooden buildings, and when Nicci saw a blaze jump from one rooftop to the next,she flung out her hand and summoned her control of air and wind. Her directedblast swept the flames away, and as she pulled it back, she sucked away all theoxygen and extinguished the fire.Nathan looked at her and groaned. “I can no longer help you in that way,” hesaid, gripping his sword. “But I will do my part, even without magic.” He ranbeside Bannon, both of them holding their blades high as the muscular slaverscharged ashore. As he prepared to fight, the young man had a strange look in hiseyes—though not of fear. He seemed obsessed.The villagers of Renda Bay had their own swords and spears, but did not seemskilled in their use. Holden shouted orders and ran bravely to meet the surge ofattackers, although he had no tactical plan.Nicci watched the fourth raider ship grind up against another dock, splinteringwood as the invaders shouted. She did not intend to let them make it to shore.No longer crippled by poison, her command of magic was at its peak strength, andshe could do more than summon wind or lightning.She called forth a large roiling ball of wizard’s fire, a molten sphere that shehurled at the prow of the ship just as the Norukai lashed up against the damagedpier. The magical blaze incinerated the carved serpent figurehead and billowedback over the bow. Flames spilled across the deck and ignited fifteen of thearmored slavers. They shrieked as the skin boiled off their bones, and theirugly, slitted mouths yawned open in a scream so wide their jaws cracked.Wizard’s fire could not be easily extinguished, and it burned the ship’s deckboards, set the tall mast on fire, and ignited the midnight-blue sail, whichroared up in flickering orange curtains. When she had used weaker balls ofwizard’s fire during the selka attack on the Wavewalker, the storm and thewashing waves had mitigated the fire, but here at the Renda Bay docks, themagical flames burrowed through the raider deck and ate through the hull.Many Norukai leaped overboard, some with skin on fire. The ship went up like ablazing beacon. The death wails of the burning enemy satisfied Nicci. Althoughshe had changed since then, those screams reminded her of when she had burnedCommander Kardeef alive, roasting him on a spit in front of the people of anewly conquered village, just to prove how ruthless she could be.By now, hundreds of Norukai had made their way into town. Raising their clubsand nets, they met the villagers who fought back with any weapon at hand. Thehideous warriors showed no fear, and they were far more skilled with theircudgels and nets than the villagers were with their seldom-used weapons.The slavers threw weighted nets on a group of three men who harried them withpikes and swords. Entangled, the men stumbled and thrashed, trying to throw offthe strands, but the Norukai swarmed over them and clubbed them until they werestunned. It seemed to be a well-coordinated operation. Once the three men werebeaten senseless, the Norukai bound and trussed them like wild animals. Theypicked up the fresh captives, one at each man’s feet, one at each man’s arms,and hauled them back aboard the nearest raiding ship.Flaming arrows continued to soar through the air like shooting stars. Niccitried to extinguish them one by one before they could fall upon new fuel, andshe struggled to take care of other fires as well, but she could not keep up.There were hundreds of flashpoints. The Norukai seemed intent on destroying thewhole town, strictly to cause chaos so they could snatch more victims. Theslavers moved like professional hunters rather than a well-ordered army, rangingfree and looking for targets. They swarmed into the town.* * *Nathan told himself that a blade could be as deadly as an attack of magic, solong as it was wielded by a skilled swordsman. His new shirt was loose,comfortable, and clean … for the moment. He charged into the front ranks of theburly Norukai, sweeping his sword sideways.Beside him, Jann and Phillip recklessly joined the fray. Phillip carried a longhooked pike that he had used as a fisherman. He threw it like a harpoon andskewered one of the slavers through the sternum. Even though the hideouslyscarred man was dead with his heart punctured, he clawed at the shaft before hefell still.Though she was small, Phillip’s wife was nimble. Jann darted among the attackerswith a long butcher knife, hacking at the arms of one slaver, slicing open theside of another. Blood ran down his exposed ribs.Nathan swung his sword with both hands, using all his strength, and his bladewent right across the wide-open mouth of one of the grotesque Norukai, slicingoff the top of his head. Next to him, Bannon became a whirlwind, not evenwatching where he hacked and cleaved. Even the slavers backed away from theyoung man’s mad, uncontrolled attack.But the Norukai were not deterred for long. They let out a hissing growl as ifit were a strange war cry, and a new group of invaders pushed forward, carryinglong spears. Each weapon was tipped with the ivory tusk of some unknown animal,carved into serrated edges. As the front ranks of slavers swept in, holdingthick clubs, the spear throwers took their stances and identified the centers ofresistance.Town leader Holden stood on top of one of the plank tables in the festivalsquare and shouted to rally his people. “Stand up to them! Do not let them takeour wives and children! Don’t let—”One of the spear throwers cocked back his arm and flung the shaft with a mightyheave. The weapon whistled through the air and buried itself in Holden’sabdomen. The blood-smeared tusk sprouted from his back.At the front lines, Nathan slashed with his sword, first to the left and then tothe right, chopping off arms and stabbing through rib cages. He looked up justin time to see a spear hurtling toward him. He felt a ripple inside, a twingethat he thought might be a spark of magic. He reached into himself, trying tograsp it to deflect the spear. A simple, instinctive spell. Time seemed to moveso slowly … but the flicker of magic vanished, snuffed out. The magic abandonedhim again, and he was helpless.Bannon grabbed his arm and yanked him sideways, and the spear whistled past.“Watch yourself, Nathan. I need you alive to help me kill more of theseanimals.”The vitriol in his voice shocked Nathan. Something seemed to have been triggeredinside him. The young man’s eyes were wild, his lips drawn back, and hisnormally cheerful smile had now become a death’s-head grimace. Blood flecks weremore prominent than the freckles on his face.Bannon leaped forward, paying no attention to the clubs and nets and blades ofthe slavers. His ginger hair flew wild, and he howled wordlessly as he hackedthrough the neck of one squat man, then cleaved the shoulder of another.“Animals!” he shrieked.A vicious slash from Sturdy opened the guts of another attacker, who sneereddown at his snakelike entrails and reached out to grab Bannon’s sword hand. Butthe young man tore himself away and spun to chop off the slaver’s arm, and in anunthinking malicious retaliation, he cut off the other arm, so that both stumpsspouted blood onto the man’s exposed entrails.“You’ll get yourself killed, my boy,” Nathan cautioned. He ran after Bannon,trying to keep up as the Norukai closed in on this unexpectedly wild attacker.One of the enemy spear throwers hurled his weapon at the young man, but Nathanswept his sword just in time to strike the wooden shaft with a loud clack,knocking it aside. The ivory-tipped spear flew at an angle, ricocheted, andburied itself between the shoulder blades of another advancing Norukai.Closing around the seamstress Jann, the slavers threw a net over her. She tuggedat the strands, driven to the ground. She used her bloody knife to cut herselffree, peeling the net away, but two muscular Norukai stooped over her and raisedtheir clubs to beat her senseless.Nathan came up behind them and stabbed one slaver in the back. When his partnerturned to glare at Nathan, Jann freed her arm and plunged the butcher knife deepinto the slaver’s calf. Roaring, he reached down to grab at the knife, andNathan sliced off his head with one clean blow. The old wizard quickly pulledaway the remaining strands of the net, freeing Jann. The small woman crawledout, exhausted and shaking.Her husband strode up, covered with blood and filled with gratitude. “You savedher. Thank you, Wizard,” Phillip said. He reached out for his wife—just as oneof the falling fire arrows struck him in the back of the neck. The steel arrowpoint, still covered with gobs of flaming pitch, sprouted from the hollow of histhroat. Phillip reached up and grasped the arrow as if annoyed that it haddistracted him from his reunion. Jann screamed, and Phillip turned to her, hiseyes wet and longing, then collapsed, dead.Bannon howled at the sky, slashing with his sword at the falling rain of firearrows. He threw himself upon two more Norukai with such fury that theystaggered back, and Nathan was forced to help him, leaving Jann to sob over herfallen husband.* * *Blazes had begun to spread through the town. Nicci extinguished as many fires asshe could, but that was a losing battle for now. She realized that if she couldnot drive away these attackers, it wouldn’t matter if Renda Bay burned.The villagers made a good accounting of themselves, though by now at leastthirty had been beaten into unconsciousness, trussed, and dragged to the firstraider ship. Dozens of Norukai swarmed back aboard, stomping on the decks. Louddrumbeats rumbled through the hold, and the oars lifted and lowered as thegalley slaves were forced to back the ship away from the dock.Nicci summoned more black lightning and brought it down, killing six Norukai whothought themselves safe aboard the retreating ship. She didn’t think she couldstop the vessel from escaping, so instead she devoted her efforts to theremaining raiders on the shore.Well over a hundred slavers still attacked. They had seen Nicci and her powers,and a few seemed to have decided that the beautiful, powerful sorceress would bea worthy slave. They were fools.One monster-jawed slaver swung a mace tipped with a ball and chain, while twoothers held up their nets, closing in on Nicci from either side. They must havethought she would be an easy target.She didn’t have time for this. She stretched out her hand, pointing from oneslaver to the next, and the third, in quick succession, stopping their heartscold. They fell dead in a tangle of their own nets.She panted, catching her breath, flexing her fingers. She had enough strength tosummon another blast of wizard’s fire. She could ignite the retreating slavership, but that would kill everyone aboard, including the new captives. Wouldthey prefer that fate? That was not for her to decide. No, she would fight theNorukai here.Nicci called up wizard’s fire and, instead of concentrating it in a ball, flunga fan of deadly magical flames at the line of advancing slavers, spattering atleast thirty of them. The relentless inferno did not sputter out. Even a glob ofwizard’s fire no larger than her thumbnail would burn and keep burning until itburrowed its way through its victim.Writhing and screaming, the Norukai fell like trees in a forest blaze. Eventhough she felt depleted from expending so much magic, Nicci called normal fireand sent it through the air until it struck the sails and masts of two moreships, setting the dyed fabric on fire. Soon, the raider vessels were engulfedin flame.Nathan and Bannon had each killed fifteen or twenty slavers themselves. Theycontinued to attack with their swords, as did hundreds of shouting, angryvillagers. The Norukai spear throwers hurled the last of their shafts into thecrowd, indiscriminately choosing targets.With the last of her strength, Nicci sent out a wall of wind, a solid batteringram of air that knocked the burly Norukai backward. With the angry armedvillagers storming toward them, the slavers at last retreated.As the Norukai frantically tried to extinguish the burning sails on their ruinedships, the attackers piled onto the last vessel with shouts and curses.Accompanied by threatening drumbeats, the slaves at the oars began to push theserpent craft back, tearing the ships free of the piers, leaving wreckagebehind.Nicci took out her knife and saw she had more work to do. She didn’t need magicto kill the stragglers left behind when their raiding ships retreated. She andthe villagers still had a long night ahead of them."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 24 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch24]Even as the Norukai ships limped away into the night, the pain and terror oftheir raid lingered in Renda Bay. The villagers pulled together to put out thefires, tend to the wounded, and count the dead—and missing.Nathan looked down at his gore-spattered sword. His new homespun shirt—whichJann had made for her husband—was now torn and soaked with blood. The wizardfound himself staring at the fabric, picking at the sticky, crusty mess. Magicwas so much cleaner than this! When he realized he was focusing on such atrivial thing, he knew he was feeling the effects of shock.He checked over his hands and arms, ran fingers across his scalp to see if hehad been injured without realizing it. In the heat of battle a fighter couldsuffer grievous wounds and never notice until he dropped dead from blood loss.Thankfully, Nathan found only minor cuts, scratches, and a bump behind his rightear. He didn’t even remember being struck there.“I appear to be intact enough,” he muttered to himself. He looked around at theflurry of people, some standing stunned and helpless while others ran aboutfrantically trying to help. He realized with an ache in his heart that, eventhough he had briefly felt a twinge of his gift during the heat of the battle,he had no magic now and was unable to heal even his small wounds.Bannon Farmer looked lost and drained, like a rag wrung out and left to dry. Hewas covered with blood, clumps of uprooted hair, gray smears of brain tissue,even bone fragments caught in the material of his shirt. During the battle, hehad fought as if possessed by a war spirit; Nathan had never seen anything likeit. Now, though, Bannon just looked like a broken boy.But Nathan had to worry more about the injured and the dying. Without powerfullygifted healers, the people of Renda Bay needed to tend their wounded bytraditional means. They had only a few trained doctors to care for maladies orinjuries, such as when the fishhook had cut poor Phillip’s nose and left a longscar.Nathan swallowed hard, remembering the man. Jann knelt next to her husband’sbody sprawled on the ground in the festival square, the extinguished fire arrowstill protruding through his throat. He had died with a look of surprise on hisface; at least the man had suffered no pain. Jann wept, her head bowed, hershoulders hitching up and down.Moving from person to person, Nathan helped the healers bandage knife wounds andwrap cloth around cracked skulls. The victims moaned or cried out in pain asdoctors used needle and thread to bind the worst gashes. When the night breezeblew in his face, the smell of blood and smoke overpowered the salty iodinesmell of the bay. So much damage …Fortunately, Nicci had unleashed her full powers, and Nathan knew how formidablethe sorceress was. But he was a formidable wizard himself—or at least he hadbeen. If he had possessed his gift tonight, if he could have woven spells justas destructive as Nicci’s, most of these casualties wouldn’t exist. The raiderswould have been driven back before they could set foot ashore. These villagerswho lay wounded and dead would still be alive, tending crops, fixing nets, orsetting sail into the bay for the next day’s catch.He had failed. Magic had failed him—and in his own turn, he had failed thepeople of Renda Bay. Nathan Rahl had failed himself.If only he could have thrown wizard’s fire at the Norukai vessels, incineratedthe sails, kept the raiders from disembarking! He could have used a bindingspell to stop them from advancing, or even unleashed a sleep web to fell themall like stalks of harvested wheat, and then the people of Renda Bay could havetied up the slavers, seized their ships, freed the captives chained to the oarsbelow like animals in pens.…Nathan clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and shouted, “I am a wizard!” Evenif prophecy was gone from the world, he could not lose everything. He refused tobelieve that with the unraveling of prophecy, his other skills had disappearedas well, no matter what the witch woman had cryptically predicted. No, he didstill have magic. He knew it. It was part of him. He was gifted!As anger swirled within him, Nathan felt an unexpected sizzle along hisforearms, tracking back into his chest, as if some arcane lightning had shotthrough his bloodstream. Yes, he knew that spark!The magic might have gone dormant inside him, but Nathan dredged it out, pulledit kicking and struggling like one of these captives being hauled to a slavership. “I am a wizard, and I am in control of my magic!” he said to himself. Hecould use it to help these people now.He saw two matronly healers beside a man who made low gurgling sounds. Stillfeeling the rejuvenating tingle inside his fingers, inside his body, Nathanhurried over to them. He could help.The victim lay on his back with a broken Norukai spear shaft through his chest.Although the jagged ivory point had missed his heart, it had ripped through hislung. Blood streamed out of his blue lips, and he kept coughing. He spasmed, andthe two distraught tenders could do nothing for him.When Nathan approached, the women shook their heads. The victim’s face contortedwith silent pain. His eyes were round and glassy. He coughed again, and a pinkfoam of blood covered his lips.“We can only wait for the Sea Mother to take him,” said one of the women. Herface was streaked with blood and tears.Nathan looked down at the broken shaft of wood, which kept the dying man proppedupright. “We must remove the spear,” he said.The other woman shook her head. “If you do that, he will die. Let the man havepeace and dignity.”“And if you leave the spear in, he will die.” His azure eyes became steely.“There might be a chance. He is beyond your skills, but I have magic—let metry.” The two women stared at Nathan, and he encouraged them to leave. “You gotend to someone you might save.”They nodded, gently touched the dying man, and hurried off to the other injuredtownspeople.When the pair of healers had gone, Nathan grasped the slick, bloody spear. Asgently as he could, though there was no gentle way to deal with such an insultto the man’s body, he pulled the wooden shaft out. The man let out a gaspingscream. Fresh blood gushed from his mouth, and a bright flow ran out of theragged hole in his chest. As the man writhed, the wound in his lung made a loudsucking, gasping sound. He would be dead in minutes.Nathan summoned the magic within him, grasped for the tingle, the touch of hisHan, and increased it to a surge, a flow of energy. Additive Magic. He had donethis many times before—so many times. It was child’s play for one with the gift,and he knew he could control it.He pressed his hands against the open wound, pushed his palms down on thestreaming blood. He could feel the healing force, and he let the magic flowthrough him. With his restored gift, he sought out the ripped blood vessels, thetorn tissue inside the lung, the brutal hole the spear shaft had tunneledthrough his chest and back. He could reattach strands of muscle fibers, cementthe splintered fragments of bone. He would fix this! He would knit it alltogether, make this man whole again … whole, as the witch woman Red had saidNathan needed to be. Whole again! The gift wasn’t gone from him. The magic wasstill his to control, even if he hadn’t yet found Kol Adair.Nathan gritted his teeth and concentrated harder, forced this man to heal. Themagic writhed like a serpent trying to escape, but Nathan made his demands. Hecould heal. He was in control. He was strong again!But in a malicious twist, the healing magic fought back, recoiled, and didexactly the opposite of what he wanted. Instead of sealing the bleeding wound,the magic ricocheted and rebounded, becoming a monster that destroyed ratherthan repaired.Magic flowed out of Nathan as he pressed down with his hands to stop the blood.The vengeful backlash erupted—ripping the spear wound into a huge gash,splintering the man’s ribs, and turning him inside out. His heart and lungsspilled out in a horrific explosion of blood and tissue. The man didn’t evenhave time to scream, but lay back arching his neck, then collapsed.Nathan stared in revulsion and disbelief down at his blood-drenched hands. Hehad felt the magic. He had tried to heal the poor victim … but instead of justdying peacefully, the man had been split open like an overripe fruit. Nathan haddone that! The victim would have died anyway, but not like this!Nathan staggered back, opening and closing his mouth, but he had no words. Hethought he had lost his magic, but this was worse than merely being impotent.The gift had turned against him. If his ability did come back to him, what if hecouldn’t control it?He stared in dismay at the appalling, mangled corpse, sure that a crowd wouldgather to accuse him of a terrible crime. He wondered if even on her worst daysas Death’s Mistress, Nicci had done such an awful thing.When he looked up, he met Bannon’s glassy gaze. The young man seemed so filledwith horror at the events of the night that this new instance had very littleeffect on him.Bile rose in the wizard’s throat, and he turned away, his shoulders slumped. Hedidn’t want Nicci to see this either, though perhaps she could help himunderstand what had happened. How could his gift have turned so violentlyagainst him? For now, even if he sensed magic returning to him, he didn’t dareuse it. He might cause an even worse disaster.Another astonishing realization came to him. What if he had decided to hurl aball of wizard’s fire at one of the Norukai ships during the battle, and itrecoiled on him instead? If the furious white-hot flames had struck back, theycould have wiped out half the town of Renda Bay.Nathan groaned deep in his throat and lurched away from the people who were busybandaging and tending the injured, splinting broken bones, propping up woundedheads on rolled cloths. He felt ashamed and afraid.He was dangerous.Instead, he picked up a bucket and joined the firefighting crews to helpextinguish the last blazes that still spread through the town. In that, atleast, he could cause little damage."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 25 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch25]The fires in Renda Bay burned until morning, and afterward smoke continued tocurl into the gray sky, staining the dawn. Houses and boat sheds stillsmoldered, some charred all the way to blackened mismatched skeletons. A groupof fishermen had salvaged six boats from the ruined docks, while throughout thetown numb-looking people assessed the damage, talking in subdued voices.Nicci reflected on the previous day’s easy activity, the relaxed conversationsamong neighbors, the quaint town activities, the small but busy market square—away of life now struck down by swords, fire, and blood from the raid.Seemingly in a stupor, Bannon sat recovering on a splintered wooden bench nextto an overturned gutting trough. Silver fish scales spangled the wood of thetrough like miniature coins in the morning light. He gripped Sturdy’sleather-wrapped hilt with both hands, as if drawing on its strength. His shirtwas torn and stained with soot and blood.As she stepped up to him, Nicci noted at least five deep cuts on his arms,across his back, on his shoulder. The young cabbage farmer looked engrossed inthought, refighting his battles. He had aged greatly.Though Nicci was exhausted from expending so much magic during the battle andtreating the grievously wounded afterward, she found enough strength to healBannon’s cuts and wounds. He didn’t even seem aware of them.Nathan came up to them with haunted eyes, his long white hair and his borrowedshirt matted with clumps of gore. Dried blood caked his hands.When Bannon looked up at his mentor, his face showed little recognition. Thewizard said in a soft voice, “You fought like an unbelievable warrior lastnight, as if someone worked a rampaging spell on you—but I know that was nospell.”The young man’s face was drawn and pale. “Slavers were attacking the village. Ihad to fight. What else could I do?”“You did well enough,” Nicci acknowledged. “You fought even harder than you didagainst the selka.”“These were slavers,” he said, as if that were explanation enough. With anobvious effort, Bannon struggled to compose himself and even managed a false,horrid-looking smile. “It’s what I was supposed to do. I hated the thought ofall of these people being hurt … and enslaved. They … they had a very nice lifehere in Renda Bay, and I didn’t want it ruined.”Nicci glanced at Nathan, who wore a skeptical frown. Neither of them believedBannon’s explanation. Nicci said, “That is an acceptable answer, but it’s notthe complete one. Tell me the truth.”His expression filled with alarm. “I—I can’t. It’s a secret.”She knew it was time to be stern, to push him in a way that would make himrespond. His wounds were far deeper than the obvious ones, and they might becomeeither tough scars or dangerously unstable fractures. Her assessment of him hadchanged in the past week, and she suspected there was more than the naive,careless country boy. She needed to find out.Grasping Bannon’s shirt, she pulled him to his feet and pressed her face closeto his so she could capture his attention with her searing blue eyes. “I don’twant your secrets for the sake of titillation, Bannon Farmer. I ask because Ineed to know the answer. You travel as my companion, and therefore your actionsmight affect my own mission. Are you unreliable? Are you a hazard to me and whatI must accomplish for Lord Rahl?” She softened her voice. “Or are you just abrave, but reckless fighter?”Swaying, Bannon looked at the sorceress and then at Nathan with a beseechingexpression. He tore his gaze away to stare out at the burned wreck of thenearest Norukai vessel, which was half sunk in the calm bay. Nicci suddenlyremembered how oddly the young man had also behaved when they camped near themuch older hulk of a wrecked serpent ship.“You’ve seen those ships before,” she whispered. “You know about the Norukai.”Finally, he said, “It’s because of Ian … my friend Ian. The slavers…” He suckedin a long, deep breath. His hazel eyes were bloodshot from the fires and smoke,as well as his own convulsive weeping. His eyes held much deeper secrets, aclear and colorful childhood memory being stripped away to reveal the raw bonesof truth.Hauling out his words like a man surrendering precious keepsakes to amoneylender, Bannon told his tale. “Ian and I were boyhood friends on ChiriyaIsland. We would run down to the shore or race each other across the windsweptgrasses. One time, we walked all the way around the island—it took us a fullday. That was our whole world.“As boys, we pulled weeds in the fields and helped harvest the cabbage heads,but we also had time to ourselves. Ian and I had a special cove on the far sideof the island, where we would explore the tide pools. Most of the time we justplayed. We were best friends, both the same age, thirteen summers old thatyear … the last year.”His voice grew raspy and hard. “One morning, Ian and I got up early because weknew it was a low tide. We went to our special cove, climbing down the sandstonecliffs, finding footholds like only boys can. We had empty sacks stuffed in ourbelts because we knew we would bring home a good haul of shellfish and crabs forthe dinner pot. Mostly we enjoyed the peace of each other’s company, instead ofbeing back in our own homes … which weren’t very peaceful.” His voice turnedsour.Nicci said, “You always described your island home as idyllic and perfect, butdull.”He turned his bleak, empty eyes toward her. “Nothing is perfect, Sorceress.Shouldn’t you be telling me that?” He shook his head and stared out at thestill-smoldering Norukai ship.“That day Ian and I were preoccupied with the tide pools, watching hermit crabsscuttle among the sea anemones, the little fish that had been trapped thereuntil the next high tide. We didn’t see the slavers’ boat coming around thepoint. The six Norukai spotted us, rowed in, then splashed onto shore. BeforeIan and I knew it, we were surrounded.“They were burly, muscular men with shaved heads and those awful scarred andsewed mouths. They had nets, and ropes, and clubs. They were hunters … and wewere just prey.” He blinked. “I remembered when hunting parties from my villagewould march across the grassy pastures in the headlands with nets, banging potsto chase down goats and round them up for the winter slaughter. The Norukai werejust like that. They came after me and Ian.“We both screamed and ran. Ian was ahead of me. I made it to the base of thecliffs and started to climb before the first two slavers caught up to me. I wasjust out of their reach, but my foot slipped, and I fell. The men grabbed me,swung me around, and dropped me to the rocky beach. It knocked the wind out ofme, and I couldn’t make a sound. But Ian was yelling from halfway up the beach.He had almost gotten away.” Bannon sniffled. “He could have gotten away.“I fought back, but there were two of them, and the Norukai were strong. Theytried to pull my arms together so they could lash my wrists. Another slavergrabbed my feet. I couldn’t get away, couldn’t even scream. Even when I caughtmy breath, my voice was hoarse. I thrashed and kicked.“Just when they were wrapping a rope around my wrists, I heard an even loudershout. Ian had turned and come back, yelling at the slavers. They threw a net athim, but it missed. He just shrugged them off and came running toward me. In thestruggle he snatched up one of the Norukai cudgels and bounded across the rockybeach, leaping over tide pools. He came to save me.“Ian swung the club. I heard a skull crack—it was one of the men trying to tieme. Blood gushed from his eye and nose. Grunting, the other man grabbed at Ian,but my friend smashed him in the teeth, turning his lips to pulp. Ian yelled forme to run, and I tore my wrist away, sprang to my feet, and raced toward thesandstone cliff. I ran as I never had before. Tugging the ropes from my wrists,I made it there and began scrambling up, climbing for my very life.“Ian shouted again, but I didn’t turn back. I couldn’t! I found the firstfoothold and pulled myself higher. My fingers were bloody, my nails torn.”Bannon was breathing hard as he told his story. Perspiration sparkled on hisforehead. “I pulled myself up, found a foothold, climbed, and then turned backto see the slavers closing in on my friend. Two of them threw a net again. Themen he had clubbed now pounded him with their fists. They crowded around him andhe couldn’t get away. He screamed.”Bannon’s voice hitched with a sob. “Ian had come back to save me. He risked hislife to stop those men from tying me up. He made it so I could get away! Butwhen they captured him, I froze. I could only watch as they wrapped the netaround Ian and beat him again, kicking him over and over. When he cried out inpain, they laughed. I could see blood running from a gash in his face—and Ididn’t do a thing. They bound his wrists and ankles with rope—and I justwatched.“It should have been me under that net. He had helped me—and I just watched!”Bannon released his grip and let Sturdy fall with a clatter to the ground. Hepressed his palms against his eyes, as if to hide. “I was halfway up the cliffwhen the slavers came for me again, and I panicked. When I reached the higherground, I looked back down at the beach. The Norukai were dragging my friendtoward the longboat. He still struggled, but I knew he was lost. Lost! I caughta last glimpse of Ian’s face, full of despair. He knew he would never get away …and he knew I wasn’t coming back to rescue him. Even at that great distance, hiseyes met mine. I had abandoned him.“I wanted to shout that I was sorry. I wanted to promise that I would come forhim, but I had no voice. I was out of breath.” He turned away. “It would havebeen a lie anyway.“Ian stared at me with a look of shock and confusion, as if he couldn’t believeI would betray him. I saw hatred behind those eyes just before the slavers threwhim into the longboat.“And I just ran.” Bannon shook his head, sniffling. “I left my friend behind. Ididn’t help him. He came back to save me, and I … I just saved myself. I ranaway.” His voice hitched and he sobbed again. “Sweet Sea Mother, he fought tosave me, and I abandoned him.”The young man looked down at the blood on his shirt, at the cuts on his arms. Hetouched a deep wound on his neck and winced in surprise, but he clearly didn’tremember how he had gotten it. The tears in his eyes had not washed away thestinging, painful memory.“That’s why I fought so hard against the slavers here in Renda Bay, why I hatethem so much. I was a coward when the Norukai took Ian. I didn’t fight then, butI have a sword now, and I will fight to my last breath.” He snatched up Sturdyfrom where it had fallen on the ground and inspected it, satisfied that the edgestill looked sharp. “I can’t rescue Ian. I’ll never see him again … but I cankill slavers whenever I see them.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 26 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch26]After a full day of picking up the pieces, the grieving survivors of Renda Baywere exhausted. With Holden dead, a man named Thaddeus accepted the position oftown leader. Thaddeus was a beefy, square-faced fisherman with a long, frizzybeard. He was well liked among the villagers, but he looked completely out ofhis element.Nicci had been watching the people throughout the day. She had always hatedslavery, and it was her mission to stop tyranny and oppression in the name ofLord Rahl, as well as for her own soul. In a way, this was how she could helpsave the world for Richard, but she doubted this was what the witch woman’sprophecy had meant.Nathan and Bannon had washed the grime from their hands and faces, but theirhair was still tangled, and their clothes were still covered with blood that hadlong since dried.Together, the villagers made a solemn procession out to the hillside graveyard,with mules and shaggy oxen drawing a line of carts to carry the dead. Thepeople, already weary, sore, and heartsick, spread out to mark burial sites forthe thirty-nine villagers who had died in the battle. The townspeople carriedspades and shovels but seemed daunted by the task of digging all those graves.“We must also erect twenty-two wooden posts,” Thaddeus said in a wobbly voice,“to remember the good people taken by the raiders.”“Carve the names into the stone and make your wooden markers,” Nicci said. “Ican use my gift to assist with the other work.” She released a flow of magic toscoop aside the grasses and dirt on the hillside to fashion a perfect grave. Itwas easy enough once she went through the process. She made an identical graveadjacent to the first, and then a third. She had many more to go.The villagers watched, too tired to be amazed, too frightened to express theirgratitude. When she finished the thirty-ninth grave, Nicci stepped back, feelingweary. “I sincerely hope you will not need more anytime soon.”With little ceremony and acknowledging that they would all grieve later, intheir own time, the people of Renda Bay buried their dead. The men and womenspoke the names aloud as they took each body from the cart and interred thevictims, a mixed range of farmers, a carpenter, a jovial brewer, two young boyskilled in a fire after the house in which they had taken refuge burned to theground, and town leader Holden, who had given up his life on the sea to leadRenda Bay.The seamstress Jann spoke her husband’s name and wept, bowing her head over thegrave as Phillip’s body was laid to rest and covered with dirt. “He just wantedto build boats,” she said. “After the accident with the fishhook, he prefered tostay on land. He thought it would be safer.” Her shoulders shuddered. “Safer.”Nathan stood next to the small woman, his gaze somber, his head lowered.Awkwardly, the seamstress held out a folded gray garment for him. “This isanother of Phillip’s shirts, Nathan. You fought with us, you saved me, and—” Hervoice broke with a quick choking sound. She sniffled, and her lips trembled.“And your first new shirt was ruined. Phillip would want you to have this.”“I would be honored.” The wizard pressed the clean linen against his chest.Although they had fought alongside the people of Renda Bay, Nicci did not feelshe had finished her mission here. After they had filled in the graves andwoodcarvers had cut names into the fresh-cut posts, Nicci addressed thevillagers before they left the graveyard.“This is why you need Lord Rahl,” she said. “His goal is to stop such violenceand bloodshed, to crush slavers so that all people can live their lives infreedom. Yes, he is far away, but the D’Haran army will not tolerate suchlawlessness and oppression. It may take time, but the world will change—theworld has already changed. You must have noticed the stars.”The villagers muttered, listening to her with a different attitude after theirordeal.She continued in a stronger voice. “But you have to be responsible foryourselves as well. When you’ve picked up the pieces here, send an envoy on thelong journey north to the People’s Palace. In D’Hara, swear your loyalty to LordRahl and tell him what happened here. Tell him about all the lands of the oldempire that need him. He will not let you down.”Nathan said, “Before you send envoys, we will write a message for him, as wellas a summary of what we have seen. If someone could deliver that, we would bemost grateful.”Thaddeus swallowed hard. “Even though they were defeated last night, the Norukaiwill return. How soon can your Lord Rahl send his army?”Nicci wasn’t finished. “You cannot simply wait for help. All people areresponsible for their own lives, their own destinies. You must improve your owndefenses, and you will need more than a bonfire and a lookout tower. The slaversbelieve you are weak, and that is why they prey on you. The best way to insureyour peace is through strength. Maybe last night was a lesson for them. We werehere to help this time, but you would not need to be rescued if you weren’tvictims in the first place.”“You can learn how to defend yourselves,” Bannon said, looking away. “I did.”“But how?” Thaddeus said. “Erect walls along the shore? String a barrier chainacross the harbor? How are we to raise an army? Where do we get weapons? We arejust a fishing village.”Nathan suggested, “In addition to your bonfire and lookout platform, build guardtowers on either side of the harbor, and be ready to launch a rain of firearrows down on any raiders who come. Keep several longboats at the ready to goout and sink them before they enter the harbor. The raider vessels will beflaming wrecks before they ever get to shore.”Nicci said in a hard voice, “The Norukai are slavers, not conquerors. You havean advantage, because they want to capture you alive, otherwise you are no goodto them. Other attackers may just slaughter you all.”“I would be happy to kill them,” Jann growled.Nicci approved. “Let nothing hold you back. Arm your people so they can fightbetter.”“Keep boat hooks and pikes ready on the docks,” Bannon said. “Even if theslavers get through, your people could fight them off as they try to disembark.”“Make them think twice before they come back here again,” Nicci said. As shewatched determination grow like a slow-burning fire among them, she feltgratified. “When your wounds become scars and you’ve rebuilt your homes, do notforget what happened here, or it will happen again.”* * *The next day, Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon went to the small building that servedas Renda Bay’s town hall. The interior smelled of smoke. Three of the glasswindows were shattered, and the roof was partially charred, but teams ofvillagers had extinguished the fire before it caused severe damage.The beefy town leader’s posture seemed hunched with duty. “I’ll need workers tohelp rebuild this hall, but it may take time. Our first priority is tostrengthen our defenses, as you said.” Thaddeus looked at them with a hopefulexpression. “Would you stay with us, defend us? We’ve seen how powerful yourmagic is, Sorceress. And the wizard could try to use his magic, too.”Nathan looked as if he might be sick. “No … that could be dangerous.”Nicci bit her lower lip. “I have a larger purpose to serve for Lord Rahl, andnow we must move on. The storm blew the Wavewalker far off course, and we needto look at maps and determine where we are.”“We need to find a place called Kol Adair,” Nathan said. He patted the life bookin his leather pouch. “We were told that something important awaits us there.”“We do have some maps,” said Thaddeus, distracted and troubled. “They’re in heresomewhere.” He rummaged in Holden’s cabinets, shifting aside old documents thatlisted the names of registered fishing boats, a ledger for taxes, charts of landownership. Finally, he found an old and sketchy map that showed the PhantomCoast, the southern part of the Old World marked with a spiderweb of clear,straight lines that joined the open lands.“These are imperial roads that Emperor Jagang constructed to move his armies,but he spent little time this far south. All I know is that the port cities ofSerrimundi and Kherimus are up here somewhere.” He gestured vaguely off the topof the map. “And Tanimura is farther north. I’ve heard rumors of the New World,but I know nothing about it.”While Nicci studied the map, Nathan took out his life book and quickly sketchedin some details on his own map, correcting some of his crude estimates of theterrain they had seen.“Kol Adair…” Thaddeus sat heavily in the chair behind Holden’s old desk. Hisbrow furrowed as he looked at the charts, but they seemed unfamiliar to him. Hescratched his frizzy beard. “I’ve barely been beyond Renda Bay, myself. Even inmy fishing boat, I never sailed out of sight of the coast.“I’ve heard stories of distant lands, though. I believe Kol Adair is wellinland, beyond the foothills and over a mountain range, across a vast fertilevalley, and then more mountains. The place you seek lies somewhere in thosemountains … according to the stories.”He ran his hand along the easternmost part of the map as if he could drawtopography on the scarred desk. “No distant travelers have come through here insuch a long time.” He pointed to the middle of the map. “But we know of othersettlements upriver, ports, mining towns, farming villages.” He shudderedvisibly. “And in the other direction there are islands out at sea, ruggedwindswept rocks where the Norukai live.” He bit off his words, then said withhollow calmness, “I would not suggest you go there.”“We won’t,” Nathan said. “We are looking for Kol Adair.”Nicci asked, “Can you supply us with provisions, packs, garments, tools for ourjourney? We lost almost everything in the shipwreck.”“Renda Bay owes you far more than we can ever repay,” said Thaddeus.“If you send your emissaries up to D’Hara bearing our message to Lord Rahl, thatwill be all the payment I require.”* * *After resting one more day and helping the villagers collect the ragged debrisof their lives, the three set out again. They all wore clean clothes. Bannon’ssword, now sharpened and oiled, hung at his side in its plain scabbard. Nathan’sornate sword had also been cleaned, polished, and sharpened.Bannon seemed troubled as they set off on the road. “Can we make a slight detourto the graveyard? There’s something I want to do.”“We already paid our respects to the fallen, my boy,” Nathan said.“It’s more than that,” Bannon said.Nicci saw how the young man had changed after his experience here. He no longerseemed so cheerful and naive … or maybe his cheeriness had always been an act.She said, “I do not wish to delay for long.”“Thank you,” the young man said.They followed the curve of the hill until they reached the line of new graves,the fresh-packed earth that held thirty-nine resting bodies. Bannon wentstraight to the part of the burial ground crowded with wooden posts. Twenty-twonew ones had been pounded into the ground, each etched with the name of avillager taken by the slavers.Bannon clenched his fists as he walked among the posts until he chose one—aclean, bright post of freshly sanded wood. On one side, a villager had carvedthe name MERRIAM.Bannon dropped to his knees on the opposite side of the post. He pulled out hissword and held it awkwardly, using the point to gouge three letters into thefresh wood. Tears sparkled in his eyes as he looked at the name.IAN.Nathan gave him a solemn nod.Bannon stood again, and placed the sword back in its sheath. “Now I’m ready togo.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 27 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch27]They followed the river inland from the town of Renda Bay, looking forward to“Lands Unknown”—the farms, logging towns, and mining settlements that Thaddeushad described for them. Someone along the way would know more about Kol Adairand give them guidance.Occasional flatboats drifted by on the river as farmers or merchants broughtgoods down to Renda Bay. The flatboat pilots used poles to guide the loadedvessels downstream. Some of them would wave in greeting, while others juststared at the strangers walking the river path.After the ordeal with the shipwreck, Nicci felt as if they had been given afresh start. Her long black traveling dress was cleaned and mended; Nathan worethe homespun shirt from Phillip, and Bannon also had a new set of clothes.As they went farther up the river valley, Bannon seemed to recover his pleasantfantasy of life again, but now Nicci realized that his smile and his optimismwere just a veneer. She saw through it now. At least he no longer tried to flirtwith her; she had frightened that foolish attraction out of him.But the young man wasn’t entirely daunted. He approached her, striking up aconversation. “Sorceress, it occurred to me that like prophecy, wishes sometimescome about in unexpected ways. And your wish did come true.”She narrowed her blue eyes. “What wish?”“The wishpearl I gave you on the Wavewalker. Remember?”“I threw it overboard to appease the selka queen,” Nicci said.“Think of the chain of events. After you made the wish, we sailed south, theselka attacked, and that storm wrecked the ship, but we found the stone marker,which confirmed the witch woman’s prophecy. Then we made our way to Renda Bay,where we fought the slavers, and the town leader told us what he knew about KolAdair. See, that was your wish—that it would help us get to Kol Adair.” Hespread his hands. “It’s obvious.”“Your logic is as straightforward as a drunkard walking down an icy hill in awindstorm,” she said. “I make my own wishes come true, and I make my own luck.No selka magic bent the events of the world around my desires just to put ushere at this exact place. We would have found our way in any case.”“Wishes are dangerous, like prophecy,” Nathan interjected, walking close besidethem. “They often lead to unexpected results.”“Then I will be careful not to make any more frivolous wishes,” Nicci said. “Iam the one who determines my own life.”* * *They continued inland for days and found several settlements, large and small.While Nathan and Nicci gathered any information they could, they explained aboutthe D’Haran Empire and about Richard’s new rule. The isolated villagers listenedto the news, but such obscure and distant politics had little bearing on theirdaily lives. Nathan marked the names of the villages on his hand-drawn map, andthey moved on.Once, when he introduced himself as the wizard Nathan Rahl, the villagers askedfor a demonstration of his powers, and he faltered in embarrassment. “Well,magic is a special thing, my friends, not to be used for mere games andshowmanship.”When Nicci heard this, she flashed him a skeptical expression. When Nathan hadpossessed his powers, he did indeed use them for just that, whenever heconsidered it useful. Now, however, he had to pretend that such demonstrationswere beneath him. When the village children learned that Nicci was a sorceress,they pestered her instead, although one glance from her made them quicklyreconsider their requests.Bannon offered to do tricks with his sword, but they were not interested.As they left that village, Nathan quietly vowed, “I won’t mention my magicagain … not until I am made whole again after Kol Adair. For now I don’t evendare make the attempt.”“You should still try,” Nicci said as they continued along the forested road.“Can you feel your Han at all? You may have lost your gift, but you could regainit.”“Or I might cause a terrible disaster.” Nathan’s expression turned grayish. “Ididn’t tell you what happened in Renda Bay when I … I tried to heal a man.”They walked along a good path up into foothills, as the main river branched andthey took the north fork. “I saw you helping some of the injured,” Nicci said.“You didn’t see everything.” Nathan waved at a fly in front of his face. “Bannonsaw me … but we have not discussed it since.”The young man blinked. “I saw so much that night, I think my eyes were filledwith blood and I couldn’t absorb it all. I don’t remember … I don’t remembermuch at all.”“One of the Norukai spears had pierced the man’s chest, and he was dying,”Nathan said. “Even the healer women knew he couldn’t be saved. But I felt a hintof my magic. I was desperate, and I wanted to prove myself. I had seen you savethe town with your gift, Sorceress, and I knew how much I could have helped. Iwas furious and I grasped at any small spark of magic. I felt something andtried to use it.”He paused on the path, seemingly out of breath, although the route was quitelevel. He wiped sweat from the side of his neck. The weight of his tale seemedso great a burden that he couldn’t walk and speak at the same time. “I wanted toheal him … but much has changed inside me. Dear spirits, I don’t understand mygift anymore. I thought I touched my Han, and I released what small amount ofpower I could find. It should have been Additive Magic. I should have been ableto knit the man’s tissues together, repair his lungs, stop the bleeding.”Nathan’s azure eyes glistened with tears.Nicci and Bannon both paused beside him.“I tried to heal him…” Nathan’s voice cracked. “But my magic did the opposite.It ricocheted, and instead of sealing his wounds and stopping the bleeding, myspell … tore him apart. It ripped that poor man asunder, when I was only tryingto save him.”Bannon looked at the wizard, aghast. “I think I remember now. I was staringright at it, but … I didn’t see, or I didn’t trust what I was seeing.”Nicci tried to understand what he was saying. “You felt the magic come back toyou, but it did the opposite of what you intended?”“I don’t know if it was exactly the opposite … it was uncontrolled. A wildthing. My Han seemed almost vengeful, fighting against whatever I wanted. Thatpoor man…” He looked up at her. “Consider, Sorceress—if I had unleashed thatkind of magic in a fight against the Norukai, I might well have annihilated allof Renda Bay. I could have killed you and Bannon.”“Can you feel the gift inside you now?” Nicci asked.Nathan hesitated. “Maybe … I’m not certain. As I’m sure you understand, I’mafraid to try. How can I take the risk? I don’t even want to practice. What if Itry to create a simple hand light—and instead I unleash a huge forest fire?Those village children who asked to see a little trick … I could have killedthem all. Magic that I can’t control is worse than no magic at all.”Nicci said, “That depends upon the circumstances. If we are being pursued by anarmy of monster warriors, even an uncontrolled forest fire might prove useful.”As usual, Bannon tried to inspire them with his cheer. “Obviously, our bestsolution is to find Kol Adair as soon as we can. Then we will have our wizardback.”“Yes, my boy,” Nathan said. “A perfectly simple solution.” He set off down theroad at a brisk pace.* * *Three days later, while passing through wooded hills with few signs ofhabitation, they came upon a wide imperial road that cut straight through theuneven terrain, then down into a broad valley. The road headed northward like astraight spear that Jagang had hurled toward the New World.From the crest of the hill they looked down at the abandoned thoroughfare, whichhad been carved by great armies, but not in recent years. The road lookedweathered and overgrown.Nathan turned to Nicci. “When you were Death’s Mistress, did any of yourexpeditions come this far south?”She shook her head. “Jagang did not consider this wilderness to be worth theeffort, although from his ancient maps, we knew there were once great cities andtrading centers beyond the Phantom Coast.”“This road may have been a built by another emperor.” Nathan smiled. “Thehistory of the Old World is full of them. Have you heard of Emperor Kurgan? Thewarlord they called Iron Fang?”They descended to the wide, empty road. Nicci raised an eyebrow. “I remembersome of the history I learned in the Palace of the Prophets, but I’m notfamiliar with his name. Was this Iron Fang a ruler of any significance?”“I spent a thousand years reading history, dear Sorceress, and countless rulershave laid claim to historical significance, but Emperor Kurgan might well havebeen the most infamous ruler since the time of the wizard wars. At leastaccording to his chroniclers. I’m surprised you didn’t know of him.”“Jagang preferred that I help him make history, not ruminate about it,” Niccisaid. She had certainly made history when she killed Jagang herself, withoutfanfare, without spectacle, exactly as Richard had asked.“We have a long walk ahead of us, so plenty of time for the tale.” Nathanstrolled ahead, following the great empty road, which took them in the generaldirection they wished to go. “Fifteen centuries ago, Emperor Kurgan conqueredmuch of the Old World and the vast lands to the south.” He quirked a smile atBannon as the young man walked on the weed-overgrown paving stones. “Not longago at all, only five hundred years before I was born.”“Only five hundred years?” Bannon seemed unable to grasp that span of time.“Kurgan was brutal and ruthless, but he earned the name Iron Fang mostly becauseof his affectation. He had his left canine tooth replaced.” Nathan opened hismouth and tapped the corresponding tooth with a fingertip. “Replaced it with along iron point. I have no doubt that it made him look fearsome, although Ican’t imagine how it was possible for him to eat with the thing in his mouth.”He snorted. “And he had to replace it regularly, due to rust.”“Doesn’t sound very terrifying to me,” Nicci said.“Oh, he was fearsome and powerful enough. Iron Fang’s relentless armiesoverwhelmed land after land, conscripting all available young fighters, whichincreased his army … and thereby helped him conquer more lands and conscriptmore fighters. It was an unstoppable flood.“But, as I’m afraid dear Richard is now beginning to realize, conqueringterritory is one thing, while administering it is quite another. Kurgan’sdownfall was that he actually believed the praise heaped upon him by theminstrels and criers, when as far as I can tell, Iron Fang’s true genius was hismain military commander, General Utros.”“Even an emperor needs excellent military commanders to conquer and hold so manylands,” Nicci said.Nathan waxed poetic. “General Utros was the strategist who led Kurgan’s armiesto victory after victory. Utros seized all the territory of the Old World in thename of Emperor Kurgan.” Walking along the easy path of the ancient imperialroad, he kept glancing to the foothills in the east, in the supposed directionof Kol Adair. “And once Utros was gone, Iron Fang simply could not functionwithout his general.”“What happened to Utros?” Bannon asked. “Was he defeated or killed?”“Oddly enough, that is not entirely certain, but I have my ideas. The story isfar more complicated than a list of military campaigns. You see, Emperor Kurganhad married a beautiful queen from one of the largest lands he seized. Her namewas Majel. Some say she was a sorceress, because her beauty was indeedbewitching.” He gave Nicci a wry smile. “Perhaps like our own sorceress.”She frowned at him.He continued his story. “Majel’s beauty was so entrancing that General Utros wasput under its spell. She found him to be a handsome man, not to mention braveand powerful—certainly he was a mate superior to Iron Fang himself, who mightnot have been as awe-inspiring as his propaganda would suggest.” He gave adismissive wave of his hand. “Or maybe there was nothing magic about it at all.It could just be that Empress Majel and General Utros fell in love. It’s clearto me, and to many historical scholars, that Utros intended to conquer theworld, then overthrow Kurgan and take Majel for his own.”“What happened then?” Bannon asked.Nathan stopped at a shoulder-high pinnacle of weathered rock that had beenerected at the side of the road, as a mile marker, although the carved lettershad long since worn away. He removed his life book, opened to his map, andglanced at the foothills, trying to orient himself. None of the foundation rocksgave any hint about the chilling prophecy or Kol Adair, though. Nicci was almostrelieved.…“Utros took the bulk of the imperial army, nine hundred thousand of Kurgan’sbest soldiers, on a campaign to conquer the powerful city of Ildakar. And hesimply vanished—along with the entire army.“It’s generally believed that they deserted, all nine hundred thousand of them.Maybe they even joined the forces of Ildakar. Suddenly finding himself withouthis army, Emperor Kurgan was weak and utterly lost. Then he discovered evidenceof Empress Majel’s affair with Utros, and in his rage at this betrayal, Kurganstripped her naked and chained her spread-eagled in the center of the citysquare. He forced his people to watch as he used an obsidian dagger to peel awayher beautiful face in narrow ribbons of flesh, leaving her eyeballs intact soshe could watch as he skinned the rest of her body, strip by strip. He finallygouged out her eyes and made sure she was still alive before upending urns ofravenous, flesh-eating beetles onto the raw, bloody meat that remained of herbody.”Bannon looked queasy. Nicci gave a grim nod, imagining that Jagang could wellhave done something similar. “Emperors tend to be … excessive,” she said.The wizard continued, “Iron Fang did that to strike terror into the hearts ofhis people, but he only appalled them, for they had loved Empress Majel. Hispeople were so disgusted and outraged that they rose up and overthrew EmperorKurgan. He had no army to defend him and only a handful of imperial guards, manyof whom were just as outraged at the crime they had witnessed. The people killedKurgan and dragged his body through the streets until all the flesh was rippedoff his bones. They hung his corpse by the ankles from a high tower of thepalace until jackdaws picked the skeleton clean.”“That is what should happen to tyrants,” Nicci said. “Jagang himself was buriedunmarked in a mass grave.”Nathan strolled onward, smiling. “And, of course, the citizens chose anotheremperor, who was just as ruthless, just as oppressive. Some people simply don’tlearn.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 28 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch28]The foothills rose up from the river valley to form a mountain range, andaccording to the information they had been told, beyond those mountains would bea broad, fertile valley with another line of even higher mountains beyond. Andthen they would find Kol Adair.Nathan thought the journey would be quite a challenge. He corrected himself:quite an adventure. During his sedentary centuries in the Palace of theProphets, he had waited for exactly this, although he had not foreseen losinghis gift along the way.Leaving the rigidly straight imperial road, which headed north, the threetravelers wound their way into hills covered with aspens. The forest was eerilybeautiful, with tall, smooth trunks of green-gray bark and rippling leaves thatwhispered and rustled in the breeze. They walked on a carpet of mellow,sweet-smelling fallen leaves.By late afternoon, Nathan found an open spot near a creek and suggested they setup camp. Bannon went off to hunt rabbits for their supper, but came back withonly some swollen crabapples and an armful of cattails, whose pulp, he said,could be cooked up into a filling, if bland, mash. They added smoked fish fromtheir packs, given to them by the people of Renda Bay. Later, Nicci drifted offto sleep while Nathan recounted more obscure and barbaric tales from history. Atleast Bannon was interested.The next day they continued into the rolling hills, following a path that waswide enough for a horse, although they had not seen a village in days. Nathanconsulted his notes. “There should be another town up ahead. Lockridge,according to the map.” He frowned as he looked from side to side, still tryingto get his bearings. “At least, as best I can tell. We should easily reach it bynightfall.”“I’m happy just to travel with you as my companions,” Bannon said, “for as longas you’ll let me.”Nathan wondered how many days, months, or even years it would take them to findKol Adair, but once they reached that mysterious place—whether it was amountain, or a city, or some magical wellspring—he would become whole again. Inthe meantime, he felt empty and unsettled. Although he was perfectly competentwithout his gift, a decent swordsman and a true adventurer, the magic was partof him, and he did not like the idea that his own Han was a restless, rebelliousforce.Alas, the farther they got from Renda Bay, the less reliable Thaddeus’s sketchymap proved to be. “I’m sure the townspeople ahead will be able to help us out,”Nathan said aloud.When they reached an elbow in the ridge and walked out onto a clearedoutcropping that sported only a single gnarled bristlecone among the rocks,Nathan paused to take a look around him, taking advantage of the exposed view toget his bearings.Bannon pointed to a higher ridge several miles away, a large granite peak thatstood above the other hills like a citadel. “There’s a kind of tower over there.What do you suppose that is?”“Another cairn?” Nicci asked.“No, no. This is much larger. A great tower, I think.”Nathan shaded his brow. The midmorning sun was in his eyes, blocking details,but he could make out a stone watchtower topped with partially crumbledcrenellations. “Yes, yes, you’re right, my boy. But I see no movement, nopeople.” He squinted harder. “It looks empty.”“That would be a good place to erect a watchtower,” Nicci said. “A sentineloutpost.”Nathan turned in a slow circle, looking at the ridges, the trees, the unfoldinglandscape. “Yes, that’s the highest point all around. From there, a person couldsee for quite some distance.” He began to grow excited as an idea occurred tohim. “I could get over there and come back to the main road in a few hours.Getting a perspective on the land ahead would definitely be worth the detour.”Nicci shrugged. “If you feel it is necessary, Wizard, I will accompany you.”Nathan felt strangely defensive as he turned to her. Since he had lost his gift,she clearly felt she needed to be his protector, his minder. “It is notnecessary for us all to go on such a side trip. With or without magic, NathanRahl is not a child who needs a nanny.” He sniffed. “Leave it to me. I’ll makemy way over there, get the lay of the land, and update my map while you two keepfollowing the path. Once you reach that town ahead, I trust you to find lodgingsand make arrangements for a meal. I’ll certainly be hungry by the time I rejoinyou.”Bannon beamed as he stepped up. “I’ll come along with you, Nathan. You mightneed Sturdy and me to protect against any dangers. Besides, I’ll keep youcompany. You can tell me more stories.”Nathan knew that the young man was earnest—in fact, Bannon was probablyintimidated by the thought of being left alone with Nicci—but Nathan wanted todo this by himself. Ever since losing his grasp on magic, and now afraid even totry lest he trigger some unknown disaster, he had felt a need to prove his ownworth.“As tempting as that is, my boy, I don’t need your help.” He realized his voicewas unintentionally sharp, and he softened his tone. “I’ll be fine, I tell you.Let me go alone. I’ll follow that ridge—see, it looks easy enough.” He let out adisarming chuckle. “Dear spirits, if I can’t find the highest point all around,then I’m useless! There’s no need for you both to go so many miles out of yourway.”Nicci saw his determination and accepted it. “That is your decision, Wizard.”“Just make sure you two don’t need my help while I’m gone,” Nathan added with ahint of sarcasm, and he nudged Bannon’s shoulder. “Go with the sorceress. Whatif she needs the protection of your sword? Don’t abandon her.”Nicci grimaced at the suggestion, while Bannon nodded with grave dedication tohis new assignment.Without further farewell, the wizard strode off into the slatted lines ofaspens, following the crest of the ridge and marking the distance to thesentinel tower. He hurried out of sight because he didn’t want Nicci or Bannonto change their minds and insist on joining him. “I am still a wizard, damn thespirits!” he muttered. The Han was still within him, even though it now feltless like a loyal pet and more like a rabid dog chained to a post. But at leasthe had his sword and his fighting skills, and he had a thousand years ofknowledge to draw upon. He could handle a simple scouting expedition by himself.The line of the undulating hills guided him down a slope following a drainage,then up around to another high point. He caught a glimpse of the tower, whichstill seemed miles away, but he didn’t let himself grow discouraged. He wouldachieve his goal, find the tower, and learn what he could. This was allunexplored territory, and he was the first roving D’Haran ambassador to beholdit, in the name of Lord Richard Rahl.His legs ached as he bushwhacked over the rough terrain. He paused to marvel ata series of arcane symbols he found carved into the bark of a large fallenaspen—ancient and unreadable letter scars that had swelled and blurred with ageas the tree grew. The symbols were not in any language he knew, not HighD’Haran, not any of the old spell languages from the scrolls and books he hadstudied in Tanimura. The markings reminded him that he was indeed in a place farfrom his knowledge.…When he was miles away from his companions, all alone in the wilderness andsupposedly safe, Nathan let himself fully consider how his circumstances hadchanged since he and Nicci had left their lives back in D’Hara. Yes, he wascertainly in fine shape for a man his age: well muscled, physically fit, active,nimble. And very good with his sword, even if he did say so himself. But hismagic had gone astray, and that bothered him in ways he could not articulate—andNathan Rahl considered himself a very articulate man.He could never forget the horror of the backlash when he had tried to heal thewounded man in Renda Bay, how the magic had dodged and twisted when he tried touse it. He was afraid of what other consequences he might endure. Whenever hehad tried to reach for it, struggling for some touch, some grasp, he had feltonly a hint, an echo … then a sting. He didn’t want to be around his friends incase some monstrous backlash might occur. But he needed to learn more about hiscondition.Now, he decided to take his chance. Out here in the forest, walking along thewooded ridges, far from anyone else, Nathan decided to experiment.Considering his options, he decided not to dabble with any fire spell, becauseit could so easily erupt into a great conflagration that he wouldn’t be able toextinguish. Like Nicci, though, he had easily been able to manipulate air, nudgebreezes, and twist the wind. Maybe he could try that.Nathan looked around himself at the forest of dizzyingly similar aspen trunks,all the rounded leaves knit together in a crown. Winds rippled through thebranches overhead.What did he have to lose? He reached inside himself, searched for his Han, triedto pull just enough that he could create a puff of air, a bit of wind, to stirthe twigs and leaves. A gentle little twirl …At first nothing happened, but he strained harder, reached deeper, released hisHan, pushed it, to create just an outflowing breeze, a gentle gust.The leaves did stir, and suddenly the air sucked toward him. The wind swirledand twisted, wound up as a cyclone. Nathan had intended only to nudge, but theair whooshed around him in a roar and rushed upward, like a hurricane blow.He struggled, grabbed at nothing with his hands, tried to pull it in, reiningback his power—but the wind only increased as the magic fought against him.Branches overhead snapped. A thick aspen bough broke in half and came crashingto the forest floor not far from him. Leaves were torn asunder, thrown apartlike green confetti in the air. The storm kept building, pushing branches,thrashing like a furious seizure.“Stop! Dear spirits, stop!” Nathan tried to center his Han, reaching for someinner valve to turn it off, to calm himself, and finally the wind died down, thestorm abated, and he was left standing there, panting hard.His white hair was tangled, whipped around his head. Nathan steadied himselfagainst a sturdy aspen trunk. That was not at all what he had intended! And itwas an even more ominous hint of the dangerous consequences he might face if hetried to use his magic. Most of the time he couldn’t find the gift at all, butwhen he did try to work a spell, he had no idea what might actually happen.Certainly not what he wanted to happen.He was glad that Nicci and Bannon hadn’t seen this. He couldn’t be responsiblefor what might occur if he blundered again. His throat was dry, and he graduallycaught his breath. “Quite extraordinary,” he said, “but not something I wouldlike to do again. Not until I understand this more.”* * *An hour later, another high clearing showed him that he had covered half thedistance to the watchtower, and he picked up his pace. It was already past noon,and he wanted to see the view, take his notes, and make his way back to the maintrail—and a comfortable village, he hoped—before nightfall.And, no, he would not dabble with magic again.The sentinel tower sat on top of a rocky bluff dotted with stubby bristleconesthat grew among large talus boulders. The nearer side of the outcropping was asheer, impassable cliff, so Nathan worked his way around to the bluff’s moreaccommodating side, where he discovered a worn path wide enough for three men towalk abreast … or for warhorses to gallop up the slope.The breezes increased as Nathan broke out of the forest and climbed into theopen area around the base of the watchtower. The stone structure was far moreimposing than he had first thought, rising high into the open sky. The loomingtower was octagonal, its flat sides constructed of enormous quarried blocks.Such a mammoth project would have required either an inexhaustible supply oflabor or powerful magic to cut and assemble the blocks like this.He stopped to catch his breath as he looked across the open terrain. From thishigh citadel, sentinels would have been able to keep watch for miles in alldirections. He wondered if this place had perhaps been built by Emperor Kurganduring the Midwar, and he imagined General Utros himself climbing to this summitfrom which he could survey the lands he had just conquered.Nathan heard only an oppressive silence that pressed down around him. He cranedhis neck to get a view of the top of the single structure, he saw large lookoutwindows, some of them with the glass intact, while others were shattered.Several of the crenellations had fallen, and large blocks lay strewn around thebase like enormous toys.Nathan called, “Hello, is anyone there?” Any watchers would have seen himapproach for the last hour, and a lone man would have been completely vulnerableas he ascended the wide path to the summit. If someone meant to attack him, theyhad certainly had ample opportunity. He wanted at least to begin theconversation under the auspices of friendship. “Hello?” he called again, butheard only the muttering whispers of wind in and out of the broken windows. Noteven birds had taken up residence there.Despite his uneasiness, Nathan felt the reassuring presence of his sword. Hewould not try to use magic again, but he reminded himself that he wasn’thelpless if he encountered some threat. He stepped up to the broken towerentrance, where a massive wooden door had fallen off its hinges and laycollapsed just inside the main entry. He braced himself, inhaling deeply. He hadpromised his companions that he could do this, and he could hardly walk all thisway and then be afraid to climb up to see the view.“I come in peace!” he shouted at the top of his voice, then muttered to himself,“At least until you make me change my mind.”He stepped over the fallen door and passed under the archway to see another setof doors, iron bars, a portcullis—all of which had been torn asunder anddestroyed. The iron bars were uprooted from where they had been seated in theblocks, twisted as if by some supreme force.Inside the main chamber, wide stone stairs ascended the side wall, running in anoctagonal spiral up the interior faces. Five ancient skeletons in long-rottedarmor lay broken on the central floor, as if they had fallen off the stairs froma great height.Though he couldn’t find his Han, didn’t dare try to summon it, he could sense apower inside this watchtower, a throbbing energy as if this structure had beenbombarded by the magic of an attacking sorcerer … or maybe it had been saturatedwith magic by the defenders who tried to save it.Nathan climbed the stairs and found himself out of breath. Though he was a fitman with travel-conditioned muscles, he was still a thousand years old.The whistling breezes grew louder as he reached the pinnacle of the watchtower,a wide, empty lookout chamber with an iron-reinforced wooden floor. The ancientplanks were petrified. Although parts of the outer walls had broken, the damagedid not seem to be due to age. In fact, instead of merely crumbling and fallingdownward, as would have been caused by gravity, the missing stone blocks hadbeen flung far from the base of the tower … as if blasted outward.Every wall of the octagonal lookout chamber had an expansive window, which wouldallow sentinels to watch in all directions. Each such window had been filledwith a broad pane of deep red glass. Three of the eight windows had beenshattered by time or brute force, and now shards of broken glass protruded fromthe window frames like crimson daggers. The other five windows were miraculouslyintact despite their obvious age, which led Nathan to guess that the glass hadbeen enhanced by magic somehow. The wind whispered more loudly, whisking throughthe broken windows.Standing in the middle of the open platform, he turned slowly as he tried todetermine what had happened here. Sprawled on the iron-hard floor were moreskeletons, all clad in ancient armor. Dark stains on the stone wall blocksmarked a varnish of blackened blood, and long white grooves seemed to bescratches, as if desperate fingernails had gouged the quarried stone itself.Nathan walked across the wooden boards, and one plank gave an alarming crack, asif it was about to give way. He instinctively lurched back, and his boot camedown on the femur of one of the fallen warriors. Stumbling, he lost his balance,fell into the wall, and reached out to grab for balance.His hand caught on the open sill of a lookout window where broken red glassprotruded. He hissed in pain and pulled back, looking at the deep gash in hispalm. Blood oozed out, and he grimaced.Looking at the blood, he muttered, “It would be such a simple task to healmyself if I had magic.” He was embarrassed by his clumsiness even though he wasalone. Now he would have to bind the gash and wait until Nicci could take careof the wound.Just then he realized that the sound of the wind had taken on an odd character.The tower itself thrummed with a deep vibration. A bright, scarlet lightincreased inside the observation room, throbbing from the splash of blood Nathanhad left behind.The five intact red panes began to glow."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 29 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch29]Continuing down the path, Nicci moved through the forest, and Bannon hurriedafter her. “Don’t worry, Sorceress, I can keep up. A woman traveling alone on anempty trail might attract trouble, but if any dangerous men see me and my sword,they will think twice before they harass you.”She turned her cool gaze on him. “You’ve seen what I can do. Do you doubt myability to take care of any problem that might arise?”“Oh, I know about your powers, Sorceress—but others may not. Just having me herewith a sharp blade”—he patted his sword—“is sure to prevent problems. The bestway out of a difficult situation is to make sure it doesn’t arise in the firstplace.” He lowered his voice. “You taught me that yourself, after you rescued mefrom the robbers in Tanimura.”“Yes, I did.” Nicci gave him a small nod of acknowledgment. “Don’t make merescue you again.”“I won’t, I promise.”“Don’t make promises, because circumstances have a way of making you regretthem. Did you promise your friend Ian that you would always stay by his side?That you wouldn’t abandon him in times of danger?”Bannon swallowed hard, but he kept walking beside her. “I had no choice. Icouldn’t do anything about that.”“I did not accuse you, nor did I say you had a choice. I just point out that ifyou had made such a promise, it was one you could not have kept.”He pondered in silence for a dozen steps. “You know that my childhood wasn’t asperfect as I wish it had been. That doesn’t mean I can’t hope for better.” Hemoved aside an aspen branch that dangled across the path. Nicci ducked and keptmoving. “And what about you, Sorceress? Did you have a terrible childhood?Someone must have hurt you badly to give you such a hard edge. Your father?”Nicci stopped in the track. Bannon took several more steps before he realizedshe had paused behind him. He turned.“No, my father didn’t hurt me. In fact, he was rather kind. His business wasmaking armor, and he was quite well known. He taught me the constellations. Igrew up in a village that was nice enough, I suppose, before the Imperial Ordercame.” Nicci looked up, finally admitting aloud what she had known for a longtime. “It was my mother who made my childhood a nightmare. She scarred me withlessons that she called the truth, made me think that my hardworking father wasthe evil one, that his beliefs were oppressive to all people. And the ImperialOrder reinforced those beliefs.”She strode ahead at a faster pace, not caring whether Bannon kept up with her.“She made me live in terrible, dirty places. Again and again I was infested withlice, but it was all for my own good, she said. It was to build my character, tomake me understand.” Nicci sneered. “I loathe my mother for it now, but it tookme a century and a half to realize it.”“A century and a half?” Bannon asked. “But that’s not possible. You, you’re—”She turned to look at him. “I am over one hundred and eighty years old.”“You’re immortal, then?” he asked, wide-eyed.“I age normally now, but I still have a long life ahead of me, and I intend toaccomplish much.”“As do I,” Bannon said. “I’ll accompany you and do my best to help you andWizard Nathan achieve your purpose. I can prove myself.”She barely gave him a glance. “You may stay with us, so long as you don’t becomea nuisance.”“I won’t become a nuisance. I promise.” He realized what he had said and bitback his words. “I mean, I don’t promise, but I will do my best not to be anuisance anymore.”“And will you know when you become a nuisance?”He nodded. “Absolutely. There is no doubt.”Nicci was surprised at his confidence. “How will you know?”“Because you will tell me in no uncertain terms.” His face was so serious shecouldn’t help but believe him.Though the wide path implied that it had once been well traveled, the downedaspens and oaks hadn’t been cleared after several winters, and she and Bannonfrequently had to climb over or step around. If there was a village ahead, itspeople did not often come this way. She had seen no footprints, no sign of othertravelers, and she decided they would probably end up camping again in theforest.The young man broke the silence again. “Do you think anyone has the perfect lifeI imagine? Do you believe there is an idyllic place like that?”“We would have to make it for ourselves,” Nicci said. “If the people create anoppressive culture, if they allow tyrannical rulers, then they get what theydeserve.”“But shouldn’t there be a peaceful land where people can just be happy?”“It is naive to entertain a fantasy like that.” Nicci pursed her lips. “But LordRahl is trying to build a world where people live in freedom. If they wish tomake an idyllic place, they will have the chance to do so. That is what I hopefor.”The path widened into a road, and the forest thinned into an open park, anexpansive area where they could see homesteads with a patchwork of crops acrossthe cleared land. The farmhouses were built from logs and capped withshake-shingle roofs.Bannon said, “Those must be outlying farms for the village we’re looking for.See how the trees have been cut down, the land cleared? All those fences madefrom fieldstones?”“I see no one about, though,” Nicci said.Although the road remained a prominent track, it was overgrown with grass,showing no recent hoofprints or wheel marks. They passed stone walls that hadfallen into disrepair; weeds and grass protruded from the cracks. Even thefields were wild and overgrown. The area seemed entirely abandoned.Nicci grew more wary as the silence deepened. On one farm, a field of tallsunflowers drooped, their large heads sunbursts of yellow petals around acentral brown circle. Bannon pointed out, “Those fields went to seed overseveral growing seasons. Notice how disorganized they are.” He shook his head.“No cabbage farmer would be so unruly.” He stepped up to the nearest sunflower,ran his hands along its hairy stalk. “These were planted in rows several yearsago, but they grew up and went unharvested. The new ones are scatteredeverywhere. Birds spread them out, and next year after those go to seed, thepattern disappears even further.” He glanced around. “And look at the vegetablegarden. It’s entirely untended.”Nicci felt uneasy. “This homestead has been abandoned. They’re all abandoned.”“But why? The land looks fertile. See these crops? The soil is dark and rich.”Hearing an odd sound, she spun, ready to release her magic in case she had toattack, but it was only the bleat of a goat. Two gray and white animals cameforward, attracted by their conversation.Bannon grinned. “Look at you!” The goats came forward, and each one let him patit on the side of the neck. “You look like you’re eating well.” He frowned atNicci in puzzlement. “If goats run loose, they’ll ransack the vegetable garden.My mother would never let goats come close to our house.”They walked up to a log cottage, where the shake roof had fallen into disrepair.An overturned cart with a sprung wheel was covered with weeds. “No one liveshere,” Nicci said. “That much is apparent.”They went around to the side of the farmhouse, where they came upon twounexpected ornamental statues, a life-size man and woman dressed as farmers. Theexpressions on their stone faces showed abject misery. The man’s lips were drawnback in anguish, his face turned to the sky, his marble eyes staring. His mouthwas wide open in a wordless wail of grief. The woman was hunched, her hands toher face as if weeping, or maybe clawing out her eyes in despair.Bannon looked deeply unsettled, and Nicci could not help but recall the stonecarvings Emperor Jagang and Brother Narev had commissioned in Altur’Rang, makingsculptors depict the corruption and pain of humanity, rather than its majesty.Jagang and Narev had wanted all statues to reflect the most horrificexpressions, just like what Nicci saw now. Was this some other follower ofNarev’s teachings?When she had lived with Richard in Altur’Rang, he worked as a stone carver andultimately sculpted a breathtaking representation of the human spirit, a statuehe called Truth. That was when Nicci had experienced a fundamental epiphany. Shehad changed.That had been the end of her life as Death’s Mistress, as a Sister of the Dark.But whoever had carved these statues had apparently not received the sameepiphany.“We should find another farmhouse,” said Bannon. “I don’t like those statues.Who would want something like at their home?”Nicci glanced at him. “Obviously someone who does not share your vision of anidyllic world.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 30 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch30]The wind whistling around the sentinel tower took on a deeper tone, like a lostmoan. The intact panes of crimson glass in the observation windows shimmered,pulsed, awakened.Nathan held up his sliced hand, cupping the drops of blood in his palm. “Dearspirits,” he muttered. As the upper observation platform of the watchtowerthrobbed with a deep angry light, he stared at the glowing red-glass panes withmore fascination than fear. Though he couldn’t use his gift, he still felt therestless magic inside him, twitching, uncontrollable. His innate, uncertain Hanfelt attuned to what was happening.A memory tickled the back of his mind, and he smiled with recognition.“Bloodglass! Yes, I have heard of bloodglass.”The temperature around him increased, as if the glass reflected some distantvolcanic fire, but this magic was heated by blood. Curious, the wizard went toone of the intact panes as the thrumming grew louder, more powerful.Bloodglass was a wizard’s tool in war. Glass bound with blood, tempered andshaped with the spilled blood of sacrifices, so that the panes themselves wereconnected to bloodshed. In the most violent wars, the seers of militarycommanders could gaze through panes of bloodglass to monitor the progress oftheir armies—the battles, victories, massacres. Bloodglass did not reveal anactual landscape, but rather the patterns of pain and death, which allowedwarlords to map the topography of their slaughter.Nathan stood close to the nearest window and peered through the glowing crimsonglass. From the top of this watchtower, he had expected to see for greatdistances—the old imperial roads, the mountain ranges, maybe even the vastfertile valley that lay between here and Kol Adair.Instead, he viewed the inexorable march of memory armies, hundreds of thousandsof fighters who wielded swords and shields, sweeping like locusts across theland. The bloodglass was so perfectly transparent that he could look throughtime as well as distance at a panorama magnified by the impurity of blood in thecrystal.The Old World was vast and ancient, allowing him to gaze across the sweep ofinvasions and pitched battles, a succession of armies, of emperors, of countlessgenerations of bloodshed. Barbarians struck villages, killing men who tried todefend their homes and families, raping the women, beheading the children. Afterthe wild and undisciplined warriors came another type of predator: organizedmachinelike armies that moved in perfect formation and killed without passionbut with relentless precision.Nathan followed the octagonal wall of the tower and peered through a secondbloodglass window. This one blazed even brighter, and the armies in the imageseemed closer. The glass vibrated, and the whole massive tower structurethrummed as if awakened … as if afraid.Nathan spun upon hearing a sound—a rattle of hollow bones. He looked at thedismembered skeletons scattered on the iron-hard wood of the platform. Had theymoved? The light filling the watchtower seemed uncertain, a thicker crimson.Outside, the afternoon sun dipped lower, but this murderous magical light wasentirely independent of it. Nervously, he rested his hand on the hilt of hissword—his slick bloody hand. He lifted his palm to look at the scarlet dropsthat ran down his wrist.He whirled again at a louder clatter of bones, but saw nothing. Surely, theskeletons had moved. He hurried to look through two more of the intact crimsonpanes, and saw another army approaching. This one seemed more ominous than theothers, more real.The warriors had pointed steel helmets, scaled armor, and shields emblazonedwith a stylized flame. Nathan remembered that flame … the symbol of EmperorKurgan’s army. Through the sorcerous magnification, he discerned a fearsomewarlord at the vanguard, and Nathan realized that he might be seeing GeneralUtros himself, suffused through blood and time.The wind howled louder around the broken walls, as if an invisible storm sweptacross the top of the bluff. Carried along with the breezes came the shouts ofsoldiers, the clatter of steel, and the pounding thud of marching boots. The redlight grew more intense, as if it shone through a fine mist of blood.Nathan drew his sword now, clamping his fingers hard around the ornate hilt, buthis blood made the grip slippery. He turned slowly, but saw no movement from thescattered bones. He hurried over to look through another of the windows and sawthe army of General Utros marching toward the high citadel, an inexorable floodof armed men converging on the watchtower. Somehow, the magic had brought themback: these ruthless soldiers seemed absolutely real. They stormed up the widestone paths, approaching the tower from three sides. He stared at the bristling,relentless force closing in.Another clatter tore Nathan’s attention away from the bloodglass. Whirling, hedid see the bones of the long-forgotten defenders twitching, shuddering,reassembling. Bathed in red light from the eerie windows, the skeletons rose upas if they were marionettes.The wizard raised his sword to fight them, but these were only a few clumsythreats. He was much more worried about the hordes of ghost soldiers pressingtoward the tower. He could hear them below, a surging crowd of swords, armor,and muscles. A gruff voice—Utros?—shouted in an accented language that Nathansomehow understood, “Take the tower. Kill them all!”Surrounded by suffocating red light, Nathan braced himself to fight theskeletons. A thunder of pounding feet came up the tower stairs. He struggled tofind the magic within him, ready to release his recalcitrant gift, whether ornot it caused a disaster. He was all alone here. Even if a backlash from usingmagic caused terrible damage and leveled this entire watchtower, at least hewouldn’t hurt Nicci or young Bannon. He might, however, destroy these spectralsoldiers.One of the reanimated soldiers clattered toward him, bony hands outstretched asif the skeleton thought Nathan himself was an invader. The wizard swung hissword and sliced through the neck vertebrae. The skull toppled off and rolledacross the wooden floor, its jaws still clacking. The fleshless hands and armsflailed, clawing at him. He smashed them, splintering the wickerwork of bones.Then he spun to dismember another skeleton, this one wearing tatters of armor.He kicked out with a boot to knock apart the loose bones of a third rattlingopponent.Then the greater threat arrived. Armored spectral warriors with flame-emblazonedshields and wide swords pushed through the door to the tower chamber, twoabreast. They shimmered in the deep red light.Nathan backed toward a wall, hoping to find some protection with his back to thestone blocks. He had no place to hide.A flood of long-dead soldiers flowed through the door, as if they meant to takeover the sentinel tower and simply drown anyone there with their sheer numbers.The wizard faced them, mustering all his strength. “Come at me, then!” Heslashed his blade across the air, surrendering the hope that he could find theragged thread of magic within him again. The flow of Han wouldn’t come to himnow. He would have to make do with his sword.Oddly, he wished Bannon were here. He and the young man could have slain dozensbefore they fell. “I’ll just have to do it myself!” His straight white hair flewas he hurled himself at the ancient attackers.Crimson light from the bloodglass throbbed around him, and he felt as if he werein a trance. He swung his sword at one of the ancient warriors, bracing himselffor the hard impact against scaled armor, flesh, bone. But his sword passedthrough, and the enemy collapsed. Nathan didn’t slow, but slashed at another,cleaving through misty armor.He felt a sharp pain in his ankle. One of the clawed skeleton hands had graspedhis boot like a vise. With a vicious kick, he flung it aside, then ducked asanother ancient warrior charged at him. He realized he was yelling. He couldbarely see through the thick, almost palpable light around him.Nathan lost track of his movements. He was in a wild fighting fury. Somethingabout the magic of the bloodglass, the violence and the slaughter that permeatedthe history of this place, possessed him. He had no choice but to fight, to killas many of these enemies as possible before his own blood stained thefloorboards, before his own body lay here among the ancient dead, until heslowly became a skeleton just like them.He charged across the platform, seeing enemies that were no more than crimsonshadows, and he heard a shattering of glass like a crystalline scream. Hewhirled and attacked and slashed, but he couldn’t see the result. He struck andshattered, struck and shattered. His blood and his sword seemed to know what todo.The hard clang and sharp shock of his steel against stone jarred him enough todissipate the red glare around his vision. His trance was broken. The enemy wasgone.Exhausted, Nathan heaved great breaths. His arms trembled. The blood from hiscut hand ran down the hilt and onto the blade—but that was the only blood hesaw. When he blinked, the air cleared to reveal bright yellow sunlight again andopen air. The bloodglass was gone.In his fury, Nathan had shattered the remaining panes. The red windows no longerlooked out onto visions of slaughter and murder, only onto an open landscape inthe slanted afternoon light. The spectral army and the remnants fromcenturies-old wars had faded, and the spell from the bloodglass was destroyed.He had been fighting against illusions. The skeletons lay broken and strewnabout, and he couldn’t say if they had actually been reanimated, or if he hadjust been doing battle with his own nightmares.He stood for a long time, catching his breath, shaking with weariness. Then heforced a smile. “That was an adventure. Quite exciting.” With his wounded handhe wiped sweat from his forehead, not caring that it left a smear of bloodacross his face.He was alone in the tower, and the wind whispering through the broken glasssounded like the distant scream of ghosts."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 31 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch31]Leaving the abandoned and disturbing farmstead, Nicci and Bannon continued downthe weed-overgrown road past houses and farms. The lonely goats followed themfor a time, but eventually gave up and wandered off into a wild cornfield thatwas more tempting than the prospect of Bannon scratching their ears.Most of the dwellings they found were empty, and some also displayed moreunsettling, anguished statues in the yards. Why would the people feel a need toown such decorations of misery? Nicci led the way toward the main town, growingmore tense, fearing what she would find ahead. Though the land seemed fertileand the weather hospitable, these homes had clearly been vacant for years. “Itmakes no sense. Where did everyone go?”Nicci paused in front of a large home with unruly flowerbeds, a scraggly gardenpatch, and drooping apple trees with half-rotted fruit ravaged by birds. Twomore statues stood there: a boy and girl no more than nine years old, both ontheir knees, expressions full of despair, weeping stone tears.While Bannon stared at the unsettling figures, Nicci was angry that some madsculptor would revel in displaying such pain, and that these villagers hadwillingly displayed them. Nicci had felt no deep emotions when Emperor Jagangcommissioned such sculptures, because she knew what a ruthless, twisted man hewas. Only Nicci, with her heart of black ice, had been his match.But this isolated village, far from the reach of the Imperial Order, had forsome reason decided to depict a very similar misery. Nicci found it deeplydisturbing.They came upon a stream flowing down the wooded hillside, where a miller’swaterwheel caught the current and turned. Water sluiced over the paddles torotate a grinding stone, but after years without maintenance, the wheel wobbledoff center and made a loud scraping sound. Some of the wooden planks in thewalls of the mill had fallen in.She and Bannon reached the town itself, a hundred homes around a main square andmarketplace. Most dwellings had been built for single families, but others weretwo stories tall, constructed with wood from the hillsides and stones from anearby quarry. The entire town was simply deserted.The open square held a stone fountain, now dry; a smithy fallen into disrepair,its forge long cold; a silent and empty inn and tavern. There were also awarehouse, several merchant offices, an eating establishment, a livery, andbarns filled with old hay, but no horses. Around the square, wooden tables andkiosks showed the remnants of what must have been a thriving market. Shriveledhusks and rotted cores showed what remained of the produce at farmers’ stalls.Feral chickens scuttled through the town square.Although peripheral details sank into Nicci’s consciousness, her attention wasfixated on the numerous statues in the square. Countless stone figures stood inthe market, in the doorways, by the vegetable stalls, by the water well.Bannon looked sick. Each of the sculptures wore the same look of horror andanguish, smooth marble eyes open wide in appalled disbelief, or clenched shut infurious denial, stone lips drawn back in sobs.Bannon shook his head. “Sweet Sea Mother, why would someone do that? I alwaystry to imagine a nice world. Who would want to imagine this? Why would someonedo this to a town?”A deep voice rang out. “Because they were guilty.”They whirled to see a bald man emerging from a dark wooden building that lookedlike the home of an important person. Tall and thin, with an unnaturallyelongated skull, he strode down the street. A gold circlet rested on his headjust above the brow. The stranger’s long black robes flowed as he walked. Thesleeves belled out at the cuffs, and a thick gold chain served as a belt aroundhis waist. His piercing eyes were the palest blue Nicci had ever seen, as clearas water in a mountain stream. His face was so grim, he made even the Keeperlook cheerful.Bannon instinctively drew his sword to defend them, but Nicci took a stepforward. “Guilty of what? And who are you?”The gaunt man stopped before them, drawing himself even taller. He seemedsatisfied to be surrounded by numerous statues of misery. “Each was guilty ofhis own crimes, her own indiscretions. It would take far too long for me to namethem all.”Nicci faced the man’s implacable, pale stare. “I asked your name. Are you theonly one left here? Where did the others go?”“I am the Adjudicator,” he said in a deep baritone voice. “I have broughtjustice to this town of Lockridge and to many towns.”“We’re just travelers,” Bannon said. “We’re looking for food and a place tosleep, maybe to get some supplies.”Nicci focused her concentration on the strange man. “You are a wizard.” Shecould sense the gift within him, the magic he contained.“I am the Adjudicator,” he repeated. “I bear the gift and the responsibility. Ihave the tools and the power to bring justice.” He looked at them sternly, hiswater-pale eyes raking over Nicci’s form and then Bannon’s, as if he weredissecting them and looking for corruption within.“Who appointed you?” Nicci asked.“Justice appointed me,” he said, as if Nicci were the most foolish person he hadever met. “Many years ago I was just a magistrate, and I roved the districts bycommon consent, for the people required an impartial law. I would go from townto town, where they presented the accused to me, and I served as judge. I wouldhear the laws they had broken, I would look at the accused, and I woulddetermine the truth of what they had done, as well as the punishment for theircrimes.”He pressed a long-fingered hand to the center of his chest, which was covered bythe black robes. “That was my gift. I could know the truth of what someone said.Through magic I determined whether they were innocent or guilty, and then Idecreed the appropriate sentence, which the town leaders imposed. That was ourcommon agreement. That was our law.”“Like a Confessor,” Nicci said. “A male Confessor.”The strange man gave her a blank stare. “I know nothing of Confessors. I am theAdjudicator.”“But where are all the people?” Bannon asked. “If you passed sentence and thevillagers agreed to it, where are they? Why did they all leave this town?”“They did not leave,” said the grim wizard. “But my calling changed, becamestronger. I became stronger. The amulet, by which I determined truth andinnocence, became a part of me, and I grew much more powerful.”The Adjudicator pulled open the folds of the black robe to expose his bare chestand an amulet: a golden triangular plate carved with ornate loops, arcanesymbols, and spell-forms surrounding a deep red garnet. The amulet hung by athin golden chain around his neck.But the amulet was no longer just an ornament—the golden triangle had fused tohis flesh. The skin of his chest had bubbled and scarred around it, as ifsomeone had pressed hot metal hard into skin like pliable candle wax and let theflesh harden around it. Parts of the chain had cut into the Adjudicator’scollarbone and the tendons of his neck, becoming permanently bonded there. Thecentral garnet glowed with a deep simmering fire of magic.Bannon gasped. “What happened to you?”“I became the Adjudicator.” His stony, accusing stare turned toward the youngman. “For years, the crimes I judged were mostly small—assaults, thievery,arson, adultery. Sometimes there were murders or rapes, but it was here inLockridge…” He looked up, and his water-blue gaze skated past them, over theirheads, as if he was calling upon the spirits. “It was here that I changed.“There was a mother, Reva, who had three fine daughters, the oldest eight yearsold, the youngest only three. The mother was lovely in her own way, as were thelittle girls, but her husband desired another woman. Ellis was his name. Hecheated on his wife, and when Reva learned of the affair, she became convincedthat it was her fault—that she paid too much attention to their three daughtersand not enough to her husband. Reva was desperate to regain his love.” He made adisgusted sound. “She was mad.“So, Reva smothered her three daughters in their sleep, to make sure that theywould no longer come between her and Ellis. She thought he would love her more.When he came home that night, after his furtive passions with his mistress, Revaproudly showed him what she had done. She opened her arms and told him that hertime and her heart now belonged only to him again.“When Ellis saw their three dead daughters, he took a hatchet from the firewoodpile and killed his wife, chopping her sixteen times.”The Adjudicator’s expression didn’t change as he told his story. “And when Icame to judge Ellis, I touched the center of his forehead. We all thought weknew what had happened. I called upon the power in my amulet, and I learned thefull story. I learned his thoughts and his black, poisoned heart. I already knewthe horrors of his wife’s crimes, but then I discovered what this man had done.Yes, he had killed his wife after she had killed his daughters. There was noquestion as to the murder Ellis had committed, but some even sympathized withhim.“Not I. I found within Ellis a most poisonous guilt, because he had not trulykilled Reva out of horror that she had murdered their girls, as we all expected.No, I saw in Ellis’s heart that he was actually pleased to have the nuisance ofhis family gone, and he used it as an excuse to be rid of his unwanted wife aswell as his children. He thought he would get away with it.“As that guilt flooded into me, those crimes charged the amulet. The magic grewstronger, and I unleashed it with wild abandon. I was angry and sickened. I madeEllis feel the guilt. I made him experience that moment of the greatest, mostintense, horror. It rose to the front of his mind, and I froze it there. Iturned him to stone in that instant as he experienced the most intense, mostpainful guilt of his life, reliving that appalling moment.”The Adjudicator let out a long sigh. “And releasing that magic freed me.” Thewizard touched the scar where the amulet had fused to the flesh of his chest. “Ibecame not just a magistrate, not merely one who uncovered the truth of theaccused. I became the Adjudicator.” His voice grew deeper and much more ominous.“I have to protect these lands. That is my charge. I am to find anyone who isguilty. I cannot allow travelers to pass over the mountains into the fertilevalley beyond. I must stop the spread of guilt.”Bannon swallowed audibly and took a step backward, holding up his sword.Nicci didn’t move, though she remained poised to fight. “And you judged all ofthese people as well?”“All of them.” The Adjudicator turned his chilling, watery gaze on her. “Onlythose without guilt can be allowed to proceed.” He narrowed his eyes. “And whatis your guilt, Sorceress?”Nicci was defiant. “My guilt is none of your business.”For the first time she saw the Adjudicator’s thin, pale lips twitch, in whatmight have been the distant shadow of a smile. “Ah, but it is.” The garnet inhis amulet glowed.She reacted by reaching inside herself, ready to release the coiling magic, butshe suddenly found that she couldn’t. Her feet were frozen in place. Her legswere locked. Her arms refused to bend.Bannon gasped. “What’s … happening?”“I am the Adjudicator.” He took a step closer. The fused amulet throbbed in hischest. “The punishment I have decreed for all criminals is that they mustexperience their moment of greatest guilt. Continually. I will petrify you atthat exquisite point, so that you face that worst moment for as long as timeshall last.”Nicci’s legs felt cold, leaden. She couldn’t turn her head, but from the cornerof her eye she saw her arm, her black dress, everything becoming white. Becomingstone.“You have nothing to fear, if you are blameless,” said the man. “You will bejudged, and I am fair. I am the Adjudicator.”He stepped toward them, and Nicci tried to find a way to fight, to summon hermagic, but her vision dimmed. A buzzing roar built in her mind, as if her headwere filled with thousands of swarming bees.Though she could barely see him, she heard the grim wizard’s words. “Alas, inall these lands, I have yet to find someone without guilt.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 32 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch32]As the Adjudicator’s magic closed around her like a clenching fist, Niccistruggled, but her body wouldn’t move and her brain felt as if it had fossilizedfrom the core outward. She could hardly think. She was trapped.The dark wizard must have sensed her own powerful gift, because he struck in away that she could not resist, with a spell she had never previouslyencountered. Her flesh tightened, hardened, and crystallized her body. Timeitself seemed to stop. The warm tones of her skin turned to cold gray-whitemarble. She felt her lungs crush, her bones grow impossibly heavy.Vision dimmed as her eyes petrified. Her blue irises crackled, hardened … andwith the last hint of vision she saw young Bannon with his long red hair and hispale, freckled face. His expression had often been so innocent, so cheerful andunscarred by reality, that it set Nicci on edge. Now, though, his face filledwith despair and misery. His mouth dropped open, his lips curled back, and eventhough her own ears roared with the sound of encroaching silence, she thoughtshe heard him say “… kittens…” before he became completely fossilized, thesculpture of a man buried under an avalanche of unbearable grief and guilt.When Nicci’s vision faded, all she was able to see were the nightmarish remnantsof her own past actions. Her memories rose up, as if they, too, were preservedin perfectly carved stone. Horrific, tense memories.* * *Shaken from his encounter with the spectral army that manifested through thebloodglass, Nathan left the watchtower. Alone and wary, he made his way throughthe darkening, sinister forest as the sun fell below the line of hills.He hadn’t expected his side trip to take so long, but the experience had beenvaluable for what he had seen and learned, in a historical sense if nothingelse. These lands of the Old World were soaked with the blood of centuries ofwarfare, petty warlords turning against one another after the great barrier waserected to seal off the New World during the ancient wizard wars. Readinghistory was one thing; experiencing it was quite another.He picked his way through the increasing shadows, heading back in the directionof the faint road they had been following, but Nathan feared he would walk rightpast the trail in the deepening twilight.Much as he would have liked to join Nicci and Bannon in a town, hoping for afine inn and hot food, he decided to make camp where he was. He was eager totell his companions about the sentinel tower, and just as eager to sample thelocal ale. Instead, he would have to spend the night alone in the forest. “Notall parts of an adventure have to be charming and enjoyable,” he said aloud.He found a quiet clearing under a large elm tree, where he could use his pack asa pillow. As he sat under the branches and the night grew darker and colder, hepondered his lack of magic and what had happened when he had tried to practiceen route to the tower. Right now, looking at the pile of dry sticks he hadassembled, he could not help but think how it would have been so simple to makea cheery campfire, if he had magic to light the spark. He had never been good atusing flint and steel. He didn’t have the patience or the skill; when had NathanRahl ever needed it, if he could simply twitch a finger and light a fire?Resigned, he ate cold pack food and wrapped himself in his brown cape from RendaBay for warmth, then bedded down to a restless, uncomfortable sleep. Thehomespun linen shirt that had belonged to Phillip also kept him warm.He set off at first light, bushwhacking through low saplings and shrubbery,heading instinctively in the right direction, and when he finally encounteredthe main path, he felt a sudden flush of satisfaction. Now that he was back onthe road again, he could catch up with Nicci and Bannon. According to the map, asizable town—Lockridge—should be only a few miles ahead.It was late morning before he saw the first abandoned farmstead. He drank fromthe well, sure no one would complain, and chased off two pesky goats who werehungry for attention. The hideous ornamental statues seemed bizarre and out ofplace, but Nathan had seen many odd and inexplicable things before. People oftenhad questionable tastes in art, and these sculptures were indeed questionable.The road took him past other farms and dwellings, all of them just as silent,all populated with anguished statues. Maybe some petty local prince fanciedhimself a sculptor and required each of his subjects to own his hideous work.By noon, Nathan reached the town, a typical mountain village with all theexpected shops and houses, a marketplace, a square, a livery, an inn, ablacksmith, a potter, a woodworker—but it was populated with hundreds morestatues, stone people depicted at a moment of horrific nightmares.Nathan cautiously walked ahead, scratching the side of his face, steppingcarefully in his high leather boots, afraid he might awaken the eeriesculptures. He felt like an intruder here. Under normal circumstances, he shouldhave been able to sense sorcery or danger, and he dug deep within himself, foundthe writhing, sleeping magic there, the frayed tangles that remained after hisgift of prophecy had been uprooted. But his Han was restless and uncooperative,and he didn’t dare use it. He knew better.At another time, he might have raised his voice and shouted out, but the hushwas too ominous, even more so than at the ancient watchtower. The palpablehorror and despair in the faces of these sculptures made his skin crawl. He sawpeople of all sorts: tradesmen, farmers, washerwomen, children.In the Lockridge town square two fresh statues looked whiter and cleaner thanthe others, new creations made by the mad sculptor. The appalled expression madethe young man’s face unrecognizable at first, but then Nathan knew. Bannon!Next to him stood the beautiful sorceress, whose curves and fine dress wouldhave been a work of art for any imaginative sculptor. Nicci’s face showed lessmisery than the faces of the other statues, but her expression still carriedclear pain, as if her guilt and regrets had been smashed into numerous sharpshards, then imperfectly reassembled again.A deep chill shuddered through Nathan, as he slowly turned around. Some terriblemagic was at work here, and even though he could think of no spell that wouldhave caused this, he was certain these were not mere sculptures of his friends,but Nicci and Bannon themselves, transformed somehow.A powerful baritone voice cut through the crystalline silence of the town. “Areyou an innocent man? Or have you come to be judged like the others?”A tall black-robed man came striding toward him, his elongated bald head crownedwith a gold circlet. The robes were open at his chest to display bubbling scarsand waxy skin fused around a golden amulet.On guard, Nathan replied, “I have lived a thousand years. It’s hard to hold onto innocence and purity for all that time.”“A righteous man could do it.”“I haven’t been overburdened with guilt, either.” Nathan was certain this grimwizard had created the statue spell, trapping or petrifying thesevictims—including Nicci and Bannon. “I am a traveler, an emissary from theD’Haran Empire. The roving ambassador, in fact.”“And I am the Adjudicator.” The man stepped forward, and the deep red garnet onhis fused amulet began to glow.At another time, Nathan would have released his magic to attack, but he had nogift that would help him. His hand darted down to grab the hilt of his sword,but his arm moved slowly, lethargically. He realized his feet were rooted inplace. Nathan guessed what was happening.The Adjudicator closed in, his water-blue eyes fixed on him. “Only the innocentshall pass onward, and I will find your guilt, old man. I will find all of it.”* * *Nicci was frozen inside a petrified gallery of her life, the accusatory momentsof her actions. She had no choice but to face the terrible things she had done,the darkness of her life … Death’s Mistress … servant of the Keeper. Thatpsychological weight was far greater than tons of rock.She had tortured and killed many as a necessary part of her service to Jagang.She had aided the Imperial Order, falsely believing that she served all humanityby enforcing equality, helping the poor and the infirm, redistributing thewealth of greedy manipulators. She felt no guilt for that.From a long time ago, she regretted that she had missed her father’s funeral,but the Sisters had not allowed her to leave the Palace of the Prophets. Herfather, an ambitious armorer, a good manager (she realized now), a man whosework had been appreciated by his customers until the Order ruined him. Nicci hadbeen part of that downfall, as a dedicated young girl, brainwashed by hermother. She had become a believer, a wholehearted follower.When one believed and followed something that was wrong, must there be guilt?Kept inside the Palace of the Prophets for so many years, Nicci had also missedthe death of her overbearing mother. She had attended that funeral, however,although she felt no guilt over the loss of the abusive woman. In order toobtain a fine black dress for the ceremony, Nicci had surrendered her body tothe groping, lecherous embraces of a loathsome tailor, but it was the price shehad agreed to pay. She had done what was necessary. That held no guilt. And shehad preferred to wear a black dress ever since.As those preserved dark memories rose inside her mind, she felt a need to atonefor abducting Richard from his beloved Kahlan, forcing him to go away with herin a sham partnership to Altur’Rang. That had been a terrible thing, even ifNicci had been doing it to convince Richard of the correctness of her beliefs.During that time, she had fallen in love with him, but it was a twisted andbroken emotion that even Nicci didn’t understand.The worst thing she had done, perhaps, was when Richard had rebuffed heradvances, refused to make love to her, and so she had thrown herself uponanother man in the city, letting him treat her roughly, slap her and rapeher—though it hadn’t been rape, because she herself had insisted on it. And allthe while she knew that because of the maternity spell that linked them, Kahlanwould experience every physical sensation that Nicci felt … and Kahlan wouldbelieve in her heart that Richard had been unfaithful to her, that he was theone taking his pleasure on Nicci’s body, wild with lust.How that must have hurt Kahlan … and Nicci had taken great joy in it.Yes, for that she felt guilt.But Nicci had already made her peace with it. Kahlan and Richard had forgivenher. That embittered, evil person might have been who she was a long timeago—Death’s Mistress—but Nicci was different now. She did not wallow in her pastand was not haunted by the ghosts of her deeds. She had served Richard, hadfought for him, had helped overthrow the Imperial Order. She had commandedJagang to die. She had served Richard with relentless dedication and killedcountless numbers of bloodthirsty half people from the Dark Lands. She had donewhatever Richard asked, had even stopped his heart to send him into theunderworld so he could save Kahlan.She had given him everything except for her guilt. Nicci did not hold on toguilt. Even when she had committed those crimes, she had felt nothing.And now in this new journey of her life, she served an even greater purpose—notjust the man Richard Rahl, whom she loved, but the dream of Richard Rahl—and inthat service there could be no guilt. Nicci was a sorceress. She had the powerof the wizards she had killed. She had all the spells the Sisters had taughther. She had a strength in her soul that went beyond any imagined calling ofthis deluded Adjudicator.The magic was hers to control, and the punishment was not his to mete out.Her body might have turned to stone, trapping her thoughts in a suffocatingpurgatory, but Nicci’s emotions had been like stone before, and she had a heartof black ice. It was her protection. She called upon that now, releasing anyspark of magic she could summon, finding her flicker of determination and herrefusal to accept the sentence this grim wizard imposed upon her.As her fury grew, the magic kindled within her. She was not some clumsy,murderous villager, she was not a petty thief. She was a sorceress. She wasDeath’s Mistress.Inside and around her Nicci felt the stone begin to crack.…* * *The Adjudicator’s long face was sallow and dour, as if all humor had beenleached away. He showed no pleasure as he explained Nathan’s punishment andworked the spell to trap him. “They are all guilty,” he said, “every person. Ihave so much work to do…”Nathan strained, struggling to move his petrified arm. “No, you won’t.” His handhad nearly reached the sword, but even if he touched the hilt, it would do nogood. The stone spell surrounded him and was rapidly fossilizing his tissues,stopping time inside his body. Nathan could not fight, could not flee, couldbarely even move. His only recourse would have been to use magic, to lash outwith a retaliatory spell. But if he couldn’t light so much as a campfire, hecertainly couldn’t fight such a powerful wizard.Even if he summoned his wayward magic, though, Nathan knew he couldn’t controlit. He could not forget trying to heal the wounded man in Renda Bay, ripping himasunder with what should have been healing magic. Nathan had only tried to helphim.…Maybe that was the moment of great guilt the Adjudicator would force him toendure for as long as stone lasted.He heard the grinding crackle as the spell petrified even his leather pouch,along with his travel garments, and the life book. He could not breathe.Nathan felt the magic squirming within him, ducking away like a snake slitheringinto a thicket. What did it matter if he unleashed it now and the spellbackfired? What greater harm could it cause than the harm he was already facing?Even Nicci had been trapped in stone, and Bannon, poor Bannon, was alreadyparalyzed in endless anguish.Nathan had nothing to lose. No matter what unexpected backlash his magic mighttrigger, if he could release it and strike back, even in some awkward way, atleast that would be something.His lungs crushed down as the stone weight of guilt squeezed him, suffocatedhim, but he managed to gasp out some words. “I am Nathan … Nathan the prophet.”He caught one more fractional breath, one more gasp of words. “Nathan thewizard!”The magic crawled out of him like a fanged eel startled from a dark underwateralcove. Nathan released it, not knowing what it would do … not caring. It lashedout, uncontrolled.He heard and felt a white-hot sizzle building within his body. For a moment hewas sure that his own form would explode, that his skull would erupt withuncontained power.In front of him, the statue of Nicci seemed to be changing, softening, withcountless eggshell cracks all over the white stone that had captured herperfection. Nathan didn’t think he was doing it. His own magic was here …boiling out—and spraying like scalding oil on the Adjudicator.The grim wizard recoiled, staggering backward. “What are you doing?” He raised ahand and clapped the other to his amulet. “No!”The petrification spell that the Adjudicator had wrapped around Nathan like asmothering cloak now slipped off of him, ricocheted and combined with Nathan’swild magic. Reacting, backfiring.The dour man straightened, then convulsed in horror. His lantern jaw droppedopen, and his expression fell into abject despair. His water-blue eyes began toturn white, and his robe stiffened, changing to stone. “I am the Adjudicator!”he cried. “I am the judge. I see the guilt…”With a crackling, shattering sound, Nicci fought her way out of her ownfossilization, somehow using her powers. Nathan’s vision became sharper as hefelt the intrusive stone drain out of his body like sand through an hourglass.His flesh softened, his blood pumped again.Nathan’s unchecked magic likewise thrashed and curled and whipped. TheAdjudicator writhed and screamed as he gradually froze in place, even his robeturning to marble.“You. Are. Guilty!” Nathan said to the transforming Adjudicator when he couldbreathe again. “Your crime is that you judged all these people.”Stone engulfed the Adjudicator, crackling up through his skin, stiffening thelids around his wide-open eyes. “No!” It wasn’t a denial, but a horror, arealization. “What have I done?” His voice became scratchier, rougher as histhroat hardened and his chest solidified so that he couldn’t breathe. “All thosepeople!” The stone locked his face in an expression of immeasurable regret andshame, his mouth open as he uttered one last, incomplete “No!” He became thenewest statue in the town of Lockridge.Staring at the stone figure, Nathan felt his rampant magic dissipate. Just likethat, it was no longer available to his touch. He sucked in a deep breath andfelt life flow through him again."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 33 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch33]When the Adjudicator himself turned to stone, his spell shattered and dissipatedthroughout the town.No longer petrified, Nicci slowly straightened and let out a long breath, halfexpecting to see an exhalation of dust from her lungs. Her blond hair and theskin of her neck became supple again, the fabric of her black dress flowed. Shelifted her arms, looked at her hands.Through her own determination, she had broken the fossilization spell that ranthroughout herself, but Nathan had defeated the farther-reaching stranglehold ofthe twisted Adjudicator. Now, the old wizard flexed his arms and stamped hislegs to restore his circulation. He shook his head, bewildered.Nearby, the statue of Bannon, his expression locked in guilty despair, slowlysuffused with color. His pink skin, rusty freckles, and ginger hair wererestored. Instead of being amazed to find himself alive again, though, Bannondropped to his knees in the town square and let out a keening wail. Hisshoulders shook, and he bowed his head, sobbing.Nathan tried to comfort the distraught young man, patting him on the shoulder,although he did not speak. Stepping close to Bannon, Nicci softened her voice.“We are safe now. Whatever you experienced was your past. It is who you were,not who you are. You need have no guilt about who you are.” She guessed that hecontinued to suffer over losing his friend Ian to the slavers.But, why had he uttered the word “kittens” as he turned to stone?In the streets and square around them, a low crackle slowly grew to a rumbleaccompanied by a stirring of breezes that sounded like astonished whispers.Nicci turned around and saw the villagers trapped in stone by the Adjudicator’sbrutal justice: one by one, they began to move.As the gathered, tortured sculptures were restored to flesh, they remainedoverwhelmed by the nightmarish memories they had endured for so long. Then thesobbing and wailing began, rising to a cacophony of the damned. These peoplewere too caught up in their own ordeal to look around and realize they had beenreleased from the terrible spell.Bannon finally climbed back to his feet, his eyes red and puffy, his facestreaked with tears. “We’re safe now,” he said, as if he could comfort thevillagers. “It’ll be all right.”Some of the people of Lockridge heard him, but most were too stunned tounderstand. Husbands and wives found each other and embraced, clinging indesperate hugs. Wailing children ran to their parents to be swept into the warmcomfort of a stable family again.The disoriented villagers finally became aware of the three strangers amongthem. One man introduced himself as Lockridge mayor Raymond Barre. “I speak forthe people of this town.” He looked from Nicci, to Nathan, to Bannon. “Are youthe ones who saved us?”“We are,” Nathan said. “We were just travelers looking for directions and a warmmeal.”With growing anger, the townspeople noticed the grotesque, horror-struck statueof the Adjudicator. Nicci indicated the stone figure of the corrupted man. “Acivilization must have laws, but there cannot be justice when a man with noconscience metes out sentences without compassion or mercy.”Bannon said, “If each one of us carries that guilt, then we are living oursentences every day. How can I ever forget…?”“None of us will forget,” said Mayor Barre. “And none of us will forget you,strangers. You saved us.”Other townspeople came forward. An innkeeper wore an apron stained from a mealhe had served an unknown number of years before. Farmers and grocers stared atthe ramshackle appearance of the village, at their broken-down vendor stalls,the remnants of rotted fruits and vegetables, the dilapidated shutters aroundthe windows of the inn, the collapsed roof on the livery, the hay in the barnturned gray with age.“How long has it been?” asked a woman whose dark brown hair had fallen out ofits unruly bun. She wiped her hands on her skirts. “Last I remember, it wasspring. Now it seems to be summer.”“But summer of which year?” asked the blacksmith. He gestured toward the hingeson the nearby door of a dilapidated barn. “Look at the rust.”Nathan told them the year, by D’Haran reckoning, but these villagers so farsouth in the wilderness of the Old World still followed the calendar of anancient emperor, so the date meant nothing to them. They didn’t even rememberJagang or the march of the Imperial Order.Although he was as overwhelmed as the rest of his people, Mayor Barre calledeveryone into the town square, where Nicci and Nathan helped explain what hadhappened. Each victim remembered his or her own experience with the Adjudicator,and most recalled earlier times when the traveling magistrate had come to judgetheir petty criminals and impose reasonable sentences—before the magic hadengulfed him, before the amulet and his gift had turned him into a monster.One mother holding the hands of a small son and daughter walked up to thepetrified statue of the evil man. She stood silent for a moment, her expressionroiling with hate, before she spat on the white marble. Others came up and didthe same.Then the innkeeper suggested they use the blacksmith’s steel hammers and chiselsto smash the Adjudicator’s statue into fragments of stone. Nicci gave them asolemn nod. “I will not stop you from doing so.”It was like a grim, furious mob as the Lockridge villagers battered and smashedthe hated statue until the Adjudicator was nothing but rock shards and crumblingdust. When all that remained was a pile of rubble, the people were drained,though not satisfied.Mayor Barre said, “We must go back to our homes and rebuild our lives. Clean upour houses, tend our gardens. Find all of that man’s other victims and explainwhat happened.”Nathan said, “Magic has changed, and the world has changed. Even the night skyis shifted. After night falls, you will discover that the constellations aredifferent from those you remember. We don’t yet know all the ways the world hasbeen altered.”Nicci also spoke up. “In the D’Haran Empire, Lord Rahl has defeated the emperorswho oppressed both the Old World and the New. We came here to see his newterritory and to tell you all that the world can be free and at peace. We foundthis town, we freed you, we destroyed the Adjudicator.” She looked down at theunrecognizable rubble, saw a smooth curved chunk that might have been an ear.“This man is exactly the sort of monster that Lord Rahl stands against.” Shesquared her shoulders. “And we did stand against him.”As the people muttered, absorbing the knowledge, Nathan kept shaking his head,troubled. He said to Nicci, “I studied magic for many centuries, and I recallstories of how the ancient wizards of Ildakar had a way of turning human beingsinto stone. Some of them even called themselves sculptors. They did not merelyuse convicted criminals, but also warriors defeated in their great game arena.Such statues were used for decoration.”He drew his thumb and forefinger down his smooth chin. “This kind of magic didmore than transmute flesh into marble, like an alchemical reaction. No, thisspell was another form of magic that allowed the slowing and stopping of time,petrifying flesh as if thousands of centuries had passed. I need to considerthis further.”For the rest of that day, Nicci and her companions learned that there were manyother towns in the mountains connected by a network of roads, and many of thosevillages had been served by the same traveling magistrate. Nicci feared that theAdjudicator had petrified other people as well, but with the spell now brokenthose populations would also be reviving.Perhaps this entire part of the Old World had just reawakened.…“Saving the world, just as the witch woman predicted, Sorceress,” Nathan mused.“You had as much to do with that as I did,” she said.He merely shrugged. “A good deed is still a good deed, wherever the credit lies.I left the People’s Palace to go help people, and I am happy to do so.”Nicci could not disagree.The unsettled townspeople drifted apart to explore their abandoned homes andfind their lives again. Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon joined the innkeeper and hiswife for a meal of thin oat porridge made from a small sack of grain that hadremarkably not gone bad.Bannon remained extremely distraught, though, and he struggled in vain to findhis contentment and peace again. He was short-tempered, skittish, brooding, andfinally when they were alone in one of the inn’s dusty side rooms, Nicci askedhim, “I can tell you are still suffering from the ordeal. What did you see whenyou were trapped in stone? The spell is broken now.”“I’ll be fine,” Bannon said in a husky voice.She pressed him, though. “The expression of guilt on your face looked worse thanwhen you told us about Ian and the slavers.”“Yes, it was worse.”Nicci waited for him, encouraging him with her silence until he blurted out, “Itwas the kittens! I remember a man from my island. He drowned a sack of kittens.”Bannon looked away from her before continuing. “I tried to stop him, but hethrew the kittens into a stream, and they drowned. I wanted to save them but Icouldn’t. They mewed and cried out.”Nicci thought of all the terrible things she’d endured, the guilt that she hadlifted and cast away, the blood she had shed, the lives she had destroyed. “Thatis the greatest guilt you feel?” She didn’t believe him. A greater halo of painthan what had happened with Ian?His hazel eyes flashed with anger as he spun to her. “Who are you now, theAdjudicator? It’s not up to you to measure my guilt! You don’t know how much itbroke my heart, how bad I felt.” He stalked away to find one of the unoccupiedrooms where he could bed down for the night. “Leave me alone. I never want tothink about it again.” He closed the door against her continuing questions.Nicci looked at his retreating form, trying to measure the truth of what he hadsaid, but there was something wrong about Bannon’s eyes, about his expression.He was hiding the real answer, but she decided not to press him for now,although she would need to know sooner or later.Everyone here in Lockridge had been through their own ordeal. Weary, she went tofind her own bed. She hoped that they would all have a quiet sleep, untroubledby nightmares."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 34 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch34]After leaving the Lockridge villagers to pick up the pieces of their lives,Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon followed the dwindling old road deeper into themountains. Though preoccupied with helping his people, Mayor Barre had confirmedfor them that Kol Adair did indeed lie over the mountains and beyond a greatvalley. The ordeal with the Adjudicator had made Nathan even more determined torestore himself by any means necessary.What had once been a wide thoroughfare traveled by commercial caravans wasovergrown from disuse. Dark pines and thick oaks encroached with the slow intentof erasing the blemishes left by mankind.Bannon was remarkably withdrawn, showing little interest in their journey. Hisusual eager conversation and positive outlook had vanished, still festering fromwhat the Adjudicator had made him see and suffer. Nicci had faced theconsequences of her dark past, and she had overcome that guilt long ago, but theyoung man had far less experience in turning raw, bleeding wounds into hardscars.Nathan tried to cheer the young man up. “We’re making good time. Would you liketo stop for a while, my boy? Spar a little with our swords?”Bannon gave an unusually unenthusiastic reply. “No thank you. I’ve had enoughreal swordplay with the selka and the Norukai slavers.”“That’s true, my boy,” he said with forced cheer, “but in a practice sparringsession you can let yourself have fun.”Nicci stepped around a moss-covered boulder in the trail, then looked over hershoulder. “Maybe he thinks the actual killing is fun, Wizard.”Bannon looked stung. “I did what I had to do. People need to be protected. Youmight not get there in time, but when you do, you have to do your best.”They reached a fast-flowing stream that bubbled over slick rocks. Nicci gatheredher skirts and splashed across the shallow water, not worried about getting herboots wet. Nathan, though, picked his way downstream, where he found a fallenlog to use as a bridge. He carefully balanced his way across and arrived on theother side, then turned to face Bannon, who crossed the log with barely a glanceat his feet.Nicci kept watching the young man, growing more troubled at his worsening innerpain. A companion so haunted, so preoccupied and listless, might be a liabilityif they encountered some threat, and she could not allow that.She faced Bannon as he stepped off the log onto the soft mosses of the bank. “Weneed to address this, Bannon Farmer. A boil must be lanced before it festers. Iknow you’re not telling the truth—at least not the whole truth.”Bannon was immediately wary, and a flash of fear crossed his face as he drewback. “The truth about what?”“What did the Adjudicator show you? What guilt has been eating away inside you?”“I already told you.” Bannon stepped away, looking as if he wanted to run. Heturned pale. “I couldn’t stop a man from drowning a sack of kittens. Sweet SeaMother, I know that may sound childish to you, but it’s not your place to judgehow my guilt affects me!”“I am not your judge,” Nicci said, “nor do I want to be. But I need tounderstand.”Stepping up to them on the stream bank, Nathan interrupted. “You would not haveus believe that the Adjudicator considers the loss of kittens to be more damningthan losing your friend to slavers?” He gave a wistful smile, trying to becompassionate. “Although, truth be told, I do like kittens. The Sisters in thePalace of the Prophets let me have a kitten once—oh, four hundred years ago. Iraised it and loved it, but the cat wandered away, happily hunting mice and ratsin the palace, I suppose. It’s an enormous place. That was centuries ago.…” Hisvoice degenerated into a wistful sigh. “The cat must be dead by now. I haven’tthought about it in a long time.”Nicci tried to soften her stern voice, with only marginal success. “You are ourcompanion, Bannon. Are you a criminal? I do not intend to punish you, but I needto know. You are a handicap to our mission and safety in the state you are in.”He lashed out. “I’m not a criminal!” He strode away, following the stream andtrying to avoid them. Nicci went after him, but Nathan put a hand on hershoulder and shook his head slightly.She called after the young man. “Whatever it is, I would not judge you. I couldspend months describing the people I’ve hurt. I once roasted one of my owngenerals alive in the middle of a village, just to show the villagers howruthless I could be.”Bannon turned to stare at her, looking both surprised and sickened.She crossed her arms over her chest. “You failed to prevent someone else fromkilling a sack of kittens. That may be true. But I don’t believe the Adjudicatorwould condemn you forever because of that.”Bannon splashed cool water on his face, then left the stream and began climbinguphill through a patch of meadow lilies. “It’s a long story,” he sighed, withoutlooking at her.From behind, Nathan said, “Maybe it can wait until camp tonight, after we findsome food.”As Bannon moved through the brush, he startled a pair of grouse. The two plumpbirds clucked and waddled quickly for a few steps before they exploded intoflight.Nicci made an offhand gesture with her hand and released her magic. With barelya thought, she stopped the hearts of the two grouse, which dropped to theground, dead. “There, now we have dinner, and this is as good a place to camp asany. Fresh water from the stream, wood for our fire—and time for a story.”Bannon looked defeated. Without a word he began to gather dead branches, whileNathan dressed the birds and Nicci used her magic to ignite the fire. While themeal cooked, Nicci watched Bannon’s expression as he dredged through hismemories like a miner shoveling loads of rock, sifting through the rubble andtrying to decide what to keep.At last, after he had picked part of the grouse carcass clean and wandered backto the stream to wash himself, Bannon returned. He lifted his chin and swallowedhard. Nicci could see he was ready.“On Chiriya Island,” he began, and his voice cracked. He drew a deep breath,“Back home … I didn’t just run away because my life was too quiet and dull. Itwasn’t a perfect life.”“It rarely ever is, my boy,” Nathan said.Nicci was more definitive. “It never is.”“My parents weren’t as I’ve described them. Well, my mother was. I loved her,and she loved me, but my father … my father was—” His eyes darted back and forthas if searching for the right word and then daring to use it. “He was vile. Hewas reprehensible.” Bannon caught himself as if he feared the spirits mightstrike him down as he paced back and forth. Then that odd look came to his faceagain, as if he were trying to paint over the memories in his mind.“My mother had a cat, a female tabby she loved very much. The cat would sleep onthe hearth near a warm fire, but she preferred to curl up on my mother’s lap.”Bannon’s eyes narrowed. “My father was a drunken lout, a brutal man. If he had amiserable life, it was his own fault, and he made our lives miserable because hewanted us to bear the blame. He would beat me, sometimes with a stick, butusually with just his hands. I think he enjoyed the idea of hitting.“I was always his second choice, though. I could outrun him, and my father neverwanted to make much effort, so he hit my mother instead. He would corner her inour house. He would strike her whenever he lost a gambling game down at thetavern, or he would strike her when he ran out of money and couldn’t buy enoughdrink, or he would strike her because he didn’t like the food she cooked, orbecause she didn’t cook enough of it.“He made my mother scream and then he punished her for screaming and forscreaming so loudly that the neighbors might hear—although they had all knownhow he abused her for many years. But he liked it when she screamed too, and ifshe didn’t make enough sounds of pain, he would beat her some more. So she hadto walk that narrow path of terror and hurt, just so she could survive—so wecould both survive.”Bannon lowered his head. “When I was young, I was too small to stand up to him.And when I grew older, when I might have defended myself against him, I simplycouldn’t because that man had trained me to be terrified of him.” He sat soheavily on a fallen tree trunk that he seemed to collapse.“The cat was my mother’s special treasure, her refuge. She would stroke the caton her lap as she wept quietly when my father was gone. The cat seemed to absorbher pain and her sorrow. Somehow that restored her in a way that no one elsecould. It wasn’t magic,” Bannon said, “but it was its own kind of healing.”Nathan finished eating his grouse and tossed the bones aside, then leanedforward, listening intently. Nicci hadn’t moved. She watched the young man’sexpressions, his fidgeting movements, and she absorbed every word.“The cat had a litter of five kittens, all mewling and helpless, all so cute.But the mama cat died giving birth. My mother and I found the kittens in acorner the next morning, trying to suckle on the cat’s cold, stiff carcass,trying to get warmth from their mama’s fur. They were so plaintive when theymewed.” He squeezed his fists together, and his gaze was directed deep into hismemories. “When my mother picked up the dead tabby, she looked as if somethinghad broken inside her.”“How old were you then, my boy?”Bannon looked up at the old wizard, as if trying to formulate an answer to thequestion. “That was less than a year ago.”Nicci was surprised.“I wanted to save the kittens, for my mother’s sake. They were all so tiny, withthe softest fur—and needle-sharp claws. They squirmed when I held them. We hadto give them milk from a thimble to take care of them. My mother and I both drewcomfort from those kittens … but we didn’t have a chance to name them—not asingle one—before my father found them.“One night, he came home in a rage. I have no idea what had angered him. Thereasons never really mattered anyway—my mother and I didn’t need to know, but insome dark corner of his alcohol-soured mind we were to blame. He knew how tohurt us—oh, he knew how to hurt us.“My father stormed into the house, grabbed a sack full of onions hanging on thewall. He dumped the onions across the floor. Even though we tried to keep himaway from the kittens, my father grabbed them and stuffed them into the emptysack one at a time. They mewed and mewed, crying out for help, but we couldn’thelp. He wouldn’t let us.” Bannon’s face darkened, but he didn’t look at hislisteners.“I tried to hit my father, but he backhanded me. My mother begged him, but hejust wanted the kittens. He knew that would be a far more painful blow to herthan his fist. ‘Their mother’s dead,’ he growled, ‘and I won’t have you wastingany more milk.’” As he spoke, Bannon made a disgusted sound. “The idea of‘wasting’ a few thimbles of milk was such an absurd comment that I could find noanswer for it. And then he slammed open the door and stormed out into the night.“My mother wailed and sobbed. I wanted to run after him and fight him, but Istayed to comfort her instead. She wrapped her arms around me and we rocked backand forth. She sobbed into my shoulder. My father had taken away the last thingmy mother loved, the last memory of her beloved cat.” He swallowed hard.“But I decided to do something, right away. I knew where he was going. There wasa deep stream nearby, and he would throw the sack there. The kittens woulddrown, wet and cold and helpless—unless I saved them.“No matter what I did, I knew I’d get a beating, but I had suffered beatingsbefore, and I had never had a chance to save something I loved, to savesomething my mother loved. So I ran out into the night, following my father. Iwanted to chase after him, shouting and cursing, to call him a lout and amonster. But I was smart enough to remain silent. I didn’t dare let him know Iwas coming.“The cloudy night was dark, but he was drunk enough that he didn’t noticeanything else around him. He wouldn’t dream that I might stand up to him. I hadnever done it before.“He reached the streamside, and I saw the sack squirm and sway in his grip. Hedidn’t gloat, didn’t even seem to think about what he was doing. Without anyapparent remorse, he simply tossed the knotted onion sack into the swift water.He had weighted it with rocks, and after bobbing a few times as it flowed alongin the current, the sack dunked beneath the water. I thought sure I could hearthe kittens crying. Sweet Sea Mother…” His voice hitched.“I did not have much time. The kittens would drown in a minute or two. I didn’tdare let my father catch me, and if I went too close he would reach out and grabme with those awful hands. He would seize my shirt or my arm, and he would slapme until I collapsed. He might even break a bone or two—and worse, he wouldprevent me from saving the kittens! I hid in the dark for an agonized minute. Myheart was pounding.“He didn’t even pause to savor his murderous handiwork. He stood at thestreamside for a dozen breaths, then lurched away into the night, back in thedirection he had come.“I bounded as fast as I could run along the stream, stumbling and tripping onthe rocks and low willows. I followed the cold current and tried to see in thedim moonlight, searching for any sign of the bobbing sack. I scrabbled along thebanks of the stream, splashing and stumbling, but I had to hurry.“After the spring rains, the water ran high, and the current was swifter than Iremembered it. I couldn’t see how far the kittens had drifted, but up aheadaround a curve in the stream, I spotted just a flash of the onion sack bobbingup before it sank down again. I tripped on the mossy rocks and slick mud, and Ifell into the water, but I didn’t care. I splashed deeper, wading along,sweeping my hands back and forth ahead of me as I tried to grab the sack. Icaught weeds, cut myself on a tangled branch, but the sack had drifted along,still under the water. I couldn’t hear the kittens anymore, and I knew it wastoo long, but I kept trying. I sloshed forward and dove ahead until finally Icaught the sack, wrapped my fingers around the folds of rough cloth. I had it!“Laughing and crying, I yanked it out of the water and held it up, dripping. Itwas waterlogged and heavy. Rivulets of stream water ran out of it, but Istumbled to the shore and sprawled up on the bank. With my numb, bleedingfingers I couldn’t pull open the wet knot closing the sack. I tore at it with myfingernails, and finally I ripped the fabric. More water gushed out, and Idumped the kittens out onto the streamside.“I remember saying ‘No, no, no!’ over and over again. Those poor, fragilekittens flopped out, slick and wet, like fish from a net. And they weren’tmoving. Not a one of them.“I picked them up, pressed gently on them, blew on their tiny faces, trying toget them to respond. Their perfect little tongues lolled out. I couldn’t stopimagining them mewing for help, trying to breathe, dragged under the cold water.They were so young and hadn’t even known their own mama, so I knew they had beencrying out for me and my mother. And we hadn’t saved them—we hadn’t saved them!”Bannon hunched his shoulders and sobbed. “I ran as fast as I could. I tried toget the sack from the water—I really tried! But all the kittens were dead, allfive of them.”Nathan listened with a compassionate frown. He stroked his chin as he sat on hisrock next to the campfire. “You tried your best. There was nothing else youcould have done. You can’t carry that guilt around with you forever. It’ll killyou.”As Bannon wept, Nicci watched him intently. In a low voice, she said, “That’snot what he feels guilty about.”The old wizard was surprised, but Bannon looked up at Nicci with remarkably oldeyes. “No,” he said in a hoarse voice. “Not that at all.”He laced his fingers together, then unraveled them again as he found the courageto go on. “I found a soft spot under a willow near the stream, and I dug out ahole with my bare hands. I buried the kittens and placed the wet sack on top ofthem, like a blanket that might keep them warm in the cold night. I piled rockson top of the grave, so that I could show my mother where I had buried them, butI never wanted my father to find out where they were or what I had done.“I stayed there for a long time, just crying, and then I made my way home. Iknew I could never hide my tears or my wet clothes from my father. He wouldprobably beat me for it, or maybe just look at me with smug satisfaction. At thetime, with the kittens all dead, I didn’t think he could hurt me any more and Iwas tired of running.” The young man gulped. “But I came home to find somethingfar worse.”Nicci felt her shoulder muscles tense, and she braced herself. Bannon spoke in ableak voice, as if he no longer had any emotion in the memory. “After he drownedthe kittens and came back to our cottage, my mother was ready for him. She’d hadenough. After all the pain and suffering and fear he had inflicted on her, themurder of those poor innocent kittens was the last straw for her. When hestaggered through the door, my mother was waiting.“I saw the scene afterward, and I guessed what happened. As soon as he enteredthe house, she held a loose oak axe handle like a warrior’s mace. She attackedmy father, struck him in the head, screaming at him. She nearly succeeded, butit was only a glancing blow, enough to draw blood, perhaps crack his skull—andcertainly enough to make his anger erupt.“In a futile effort, she tried to hurt him, maybe even kill him. But my fathersnatched the oak handle from her hands, tore it right out of her grip, whirledaround—” Bannon swallowed. “And he beat her to death with it.” He squeezed hiseyes shut.“By the time I came home from burying the kittens, she was already dead. He hadsmashed her face so that I couldn’t recognize her, couldn’t even see the usualparts of a face at all. Her left eye had been pulped, and broken shards of skullprotruded upward, exposing brain. Her mouth was just a ragged hole, and teethlay scattered around, some of them pounded into the soft meat of her face, likedecorations.…”His voice grew softer, shakier. “My father came for me with the bloody,splintered axe handle, but I had nothing to defend myself with, not even asword. I threw myself on him nevertheless, howling. I … I don’t even rememberit. I hit him, clawed at him, pounded at his chest.“This time the neighbors had heard my mother’s screams, worse than ever before,and they rushed in only moments after I arrived. They saved me, or else myfather would have killed me, too. I was screaming, trying to fight, trying tohurt him. But they pulled me away and subdued him. By that time, most of thefight had gone out of my father. Blood covered his face, his clothes, and hishands. Some from the gash on his scalp where my mother had struck him, but mostof the blood belonged to her.“Someone had raised the alarm, and one goodwife sent her little boy running totown to get the magistrate.” Bannon sucked in a succession of breaths andkneaded his fingers as he stared like a lost soul into the small campfire beforehe could continue. Overhead, a night bird cried out and took flight from one ofthe pine trees.“I couldn’t save the sack of kittens. I couldn’t prevent my father from drowningthem, but I ran after him, nevertheless. I waded into the stream and tried tocatch them before it was too late. But I always knew it would be too late, andwhen they were dead I wasted precious time burying them and crying over them …when I could have been there to save my mother.”He looked up at his listeners, and the empty pain in his hazel eyes struck adeep chill even in Nicci’s heart.“If I had stayed with my mother, maybe I could have protected her. If I hadn’tgone chasing after the kittens, I would have been there. I would have stood upto him. I would have saved her. She and I would have faced him together. The twoof us could have driven him off somehow. After that night, my father never wouldhave hurt me again. Or her.“But I went to save the kittens instead. I left my mother behind to face thatmonster all by herself.”Bannon stood up again, brushed off his pants. He spoke as if he were merelydelivering a scout’s report. “I stayed at Chiriya long enough to see my fatherhanged for murder. By then, I had a few coins, and out of sympathy othervillagers gave me money to live on. I could have had a little cottage, started afamily, worked the cabbage fields. But the house smelled too much like blood andnightmares, and Chiriya held nothing for me.“So I signed aboard the next ship that came into our little harbor—theWavewalker. I left my home, never intending to go back. What I wanted was tofind a better place. I wanted a life the way I imagined it.”Nathan said, “So you’ve been changing your memories, covering up the darknesswith fantasies of how you thought your life should be.”“With lies,” Nicci said.“Yes, they’re lies,” Bannon said. “The real truth is … poison. I was just tryingto make everything better. Was that wrong?”Nicci was sure now that Bannon Farmer had a good heart. In his mind, and in theway he described his old lie to others, the young man was struggling to make theworld into a place it would never be.When the wizard placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder, Bannon flinched as ifin a sudden flashback of his father striking him. Nathan didn’t remove his hand,but tightened his grip, like an anchor. “You’re with us now, my boy.”Nodding, Bannon smeared the back of his hand across his face, wiping away thetears. He straightened his shoulders and responded with a weak smile. “I agree.That’s good enough.”Even Nicci rewarded him with an appreciative nod. “You may have more steel inyou than I thought.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 35 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch35]Rain and gloom set in for the next four days as they traveled higher into themountains. The mornings were filled with fog, the days saturated with drizzle,and the nights accompanied by a full downpour. Low-hanging clouds and densedripping trees kept them from seeing far into the distance, and they could notgauge the high and rugged mountains ahead of them. Eventually, Nicci knew theywould find the high point and look down into the lush valley that lay betweenthem and Kol Adair.Nicci walked along wrapped in a gray woolen cloak the Lockridge innkeeper hadgiven her, which was drenched and heavy. Bannon and Nathan were just asmiserable, and the sodden gloom weighed on them as heavily as the young man’sreticence.On the fifth night out of Lockridge, the downpour increased and the temperaturedropped to a bone-penetrating wet cold. Nicci was pleased to find a thickwayward pine, a pyramid-shaped tree with dense, drooping boughs. For thosetravelers who knew how to identify them, wayward pines formed a solid, reliableshelter in the forest. Richard had shown her how to find and use them.Nicci shook the long-needled branches to disperse the collected beads ofrainwater, then lifted the bough aside to reveal a dark and cozy hollow within.“We’ll sleep here.”The wizard found a comfortable spot inside under the low overhanging branches.“Now, if you could just find some roasted mutton and a tankard of ale,Sorceress, we’d have a fine night.”Bannon sat with his knees pulled up against his chest, still withdrawn.“Be satisfied with what I’ve already provided,” Nicci said. She did use hermagic to light a small fire inside the shelter, and the crisp greenwood smokecurled up into the slanted boughs and away from them. Because they were soakedand cold, Nicci also released more magic to dry the moisture in their clothes,so that for the first time in days they actually felt warm and comfortable.“I can tolerate unpleasant conditions,” she explained, “but not when I don’thave to. We need our strength and a good rest. There’s no telling how far wehave yet to go.”“The journey itself is part of our goal,” Nathan said. “After we find Kol Adairand I am whole again with my magic, we have the rest of the Old World toexplore.”“Let us get a good rest for tonight,” she said, “and explore the whole worldtomorrow.”They warmed water over the fire and made a fortifying soup with barley, driedmeat, and spices. Afterward, they collected enough rainwater in a pot outsidethe wayward pine that they could make hot tea.Bannon rolled up in his now-dry cloak and pretended to go to sleep, and Nathanlooked at him with concern. “Adventures rarely turn out the way one expects,” hesaid in a low voice to Nicci, but Bannon surely heard as well—as the wizard nodoubt intended.* * *The next day as they continued through the drizzle, splashing in puddles andslipping in the trail mud, Nathan exuberantly drew his sword and rounded onBannon. “You walk like a sluggard, my boy. And with your eyes so downcast, adragon could be upon you before you even noticed.” He held up his sword andstepped in front of the young man, blocking his way. “Defend yourself, or you’reuseless to us.”Though Bannon was startled, the wizard swung his sword, but without malice, andhe did so slowly enough that the confused young man had a chance to duck. “Stop,Nathan! What are you doing?”“Waking you up.” The wizard swung again, more earnestly this time.Bannon leaped out of the way. He fumbled Sturdy from its scabbard. “I don’t wantto fight you.”“Such a pity,” Nathan said, coming after him. “When bloodthirsty enemies comefor me, I always let them know whether I’m in the mood for fighting. It makesall the difference.” He swung again, and Bannon lifted his sword to meet theblow with a loud clang. Sparrows in the branches overhead were startled intoflight, swooping away to find a drier, more peaceful bough.Nicci knew exactly what Nathan was doing, although she also understood the youngman’s lethargy. After Bannon had been forced to face the fact that his nostalgiclife was nothing more than a foolish fantasy, he was like a ship cast adriftwith no rudder or sails. Nicci had spent years building shields around her mindand heart, but Bannon was still so young.Nathan cried out in happy surprise as his opponent counterattacked, whistlinghis blade through the air. The solid ringing of steel against steel echoedthrough the waterlogged forest. “That’s better, my boy! I want to know that youcan handle yourself if we’re set upon by monsters again.”They crashed through the underbrush as Nathan chased him. Bannon wheeled todefend himself and press an attack, sending the wizard into full retreat; then,in a furious volley of blows, they brought each other to a standstill. His faceanimated now, Bannon pressed forward, pushing Nathan, who slipped in the slimymud of the trail. The wizard tumbled flat on his back, and then Bannon also losthis balance and sprawled beside his mentor. The two men picked themselves up,panting, and laughing. Both were covered in mud.Nicci watched them, her arms crossed, the woolen traveling cloak pulled aroundher. Meeting Nathan’s eyes, she gave him a nod of acknowledgment.The wizard reached out to take the young man’s hand, and pulled him up besidehim. “Dear spirits, that didn’t stop the rain, but it may have lifted yourgloom.”“I’m sorry,” Bannon muttered. “When I wanted to leave Chiriya Island, I think …I may have been running away. But now, I realize that isn’t the point at all.”He lifted his chin, which was smeared with mud. The rain kept coming down, fatdroplets falling from the dense branches above in a constant cold shower. “Iwant to go with you. This is the journey I’ve always dreamed about.”“Good,” Nathan said. “Then, let’s keep exploring.”Nicci set off in the lead. “If we go far enough, we may even walk out of thisrain.”The higher they climbed, the colder the nights got, but finally the rain ceased.The downpour had lasted long enough to wash the mud from their clothes.Two days later, the skies cleared of clouds, opening to a fresh blue, and Niccipicked up the pace, rejuvenated by the sunshine. By now, the path had become allbut indistinguishable from a game trail, and they had seen no one since leavingLockridge. Nicci could understand why Emperor Jagang had not bothered to sendhis armies down to these isolated lands, where there were few people to conquer.Occasionally, they came upon ruins of large stone buildings that had fallen intodisrepair, overgrown by the forest and reclaimed by time.“This land must have thrived thousands of years ago,” Nathan said. “After thegreat barrier was erected at the end of the wizard wars, Sulachan and hissuccessors were forced to push south instead, since they could no longer reachthe New World. There were cities and roads, trading posts, mining towns, greatleaders and internal wars. In fact, Emperor Kurgan devoted most of his conquestto the southern part of the Old World.”“That is why we’ve heard little of him in our history,” Nicci said. “He wasunimportant.”“He was important enough to these people,” the wizard said.“I don’t see any people,” Bannon said.“Use your imagination. They were here.”They stopped at a mossy, overgrown building foundation. Squares laid out on theground marked what must have been a large fortress, but now only crumblingremnants outlined the rubble. “The world tends to pass you by when you live yourlife in a tower.” He kept talking while Nicci and Bannon followed him away fromthe ruins. “Did I tell you about the time I foolishly tried to escape from thepalace? I was young, with little concept of how impregnable my prison was.”Nicci frowned. “The Sisters never mentioned to me that you had tried to escape.”“I was only a century old, just a boy, really. I was brash and willing to takechances … and I was also impossibly bored. Yes, I had the freedom to roamthrough the high tower rooms, to look at the wonderful books in the library, butsuch diversions can only distract a young man for so long before he begins todream. I didn’t want to be their pet prophet, so I laid my plans for months.Yes, they had placed an iron collar around my neck, and with the Rada’Han theycould control me and my magic.” His lips quirked in a smile, and he tossed hisstraight white hair behind him. “So I had to be resourceful and not just use aspell or two to get away.“When I kept telling the Sisters I was cold, they brought me more blankets, andI used just a tiny bit of the gift to unravel the fibers, which I reassembledinto a rope, a long rope, thread after thread. It was strong enough to hold myweight.“I spent a week being cheerful and attentive to my studies so as to lull theSisters into a sense of complacency, and then one moonless night I made my wayto one of the highest rooms. I barricaded the door after claiming that I meantto study spell books throughout the night. I was a curious young man and wantedto build my powers as a wizard, even though I knew they would never free me.” Heunconsciously rubbed at his neck, as if he still felt the iron collar there.“Because a prophet is too dangerous, you see.”He looked at Bannon to make sure the young man was listening. “I opened the highwindow and fastened my rope securely to an anchor. I was precluded from using alevitation spell, so I had to resort to more traditional means. When I loweredmyself over the sill and looked down, I felt as if the drop went all the way tothe underworld.” He regarded Bannon, cocking an eyebrow. “When one lives insidestone-walled rooms, it’s difficult to get a sense of the vastness of the sky orthe long drop to the ground below. But I was resolved. I wrapped the rope aroundmy waist and began to lower myself down the wall.”Nicci was skeptical of the story. “The Palace of the Prophets is guarded bywards and shields. No one could just climb through a window and escape.”He lifted a finger. “And why do you think the Sisters added all those protectivespells? Back then, the women assumed the shields blocking the lower doors wouldbe sufficient. They never thought I would be foolish enough to climb out thehighest tower.” He cleared his throat. “The important part is that I wasdangling by a rope from the tower wall—very brave, I might add. But I hadmiscalculated. When I was still nearly a hundred feet from the base of thetower, the rope ran out. I was just hanging there!”He paused for suspense, and looked at Bannon. “I did know how to use AdditiveMagic, so I made the strands of the rope grow. I should have guessed that theSisters would detect this through the Rada’Han, but what could I do? I certainlycouldn’t climb all the way back up. I extended the rope one foot at a time andeased myself down, but it took a great deal of energy. I was so exhausted Icould barely hold on to the rope by the time I reached the ground.”He let out a long, wistful sigh. “By then, the Sisters had discovered what I wasdoing, and they captured me as soon as my feet touched the paving tiles.”“Even if you did make it away from the Palace of the Prophets and over thebridge into Tanimura, your Rada’Han would have prevented you from escaping. TheSisters could have rounded you up at any time,” Nicci said. “I find your storyquestionable.”“My story is entertaining, and it also has a point.” He turned to face Bannon.“Sometimes you must be daring to accomplish a great thing, but no matter howdaring you are, your deeds will be diminished if you forget to plan properly.”They toiled higher along a steep switchbacked path. The trees thinned, leadingup to a high point ahead.Nathan stretched his arms. “After that, the Sisters kept me bottled up sotightly that I could never again plan a serious escape. Therefore, I amusedmyself by writing other adventures and secretly distributing them throughout theland. They became quite popular, enjoyed by many.”They were out of breath as they finally reached the summit of the ridge andcrossed over to take in a sprawling, breathtaking view.When asking about the way to Kol Adair, they had repeatedly been told about avast fertile valley filled with green forests, croplands, and villages. But thissight was not at all what they expected.As the three surveyed the landscape, Nicci saw only brown desolation to thehorizon. This was no verdant valley, but a dry and cracked crater, bounded tothe north by a high plateau. The heavily forested foothills spilled down to apale, fuzzy boundary of death. Dust devils skirled across the dry basin. Whiteexpanses of sparkling salt indicated where lakes had dried up, leaving onlypoisoned soil. The terrible desolation spread outward from a central point,countless miles away.And the dead zone was clearly growing.Nathan drew a deep disappointed breath. “I will have to update my map.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 36 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch36]With all the vegetation dead, the old road ahead became more plain, and theywalked down the rocky trail toward the wide desolate valley. When Nicci inhaled,the air carried a burnt, powdery smell with a hint of rot, as if vapors stirredup by thermal currents wafted into the foothills.They paused at a rocky switchback to look across the great basin. Nicci coulddiscern straight lines etched across the barren lands, man-made paths that werenow covered with blown dust. She could also see what had been small villages,larger towns, possibly even the ruins of a city.Nicci said, “This was a well-traveled and inhabited area, but something suckedit all dry.”“There are still habitable areas on the fringe of the desolation,” Nathan said,pointing to the transition zone where the green of vegetation faded into thecracked brown of death. He shaded his eyes and looked into the hazy distance,beyond the valley. “That blowing dust impairs visibility, but you can see thetowering mountains off in the distance far to the east.” He pointed. “Kol Adairmay be somewhere up on one of those mountain passes.”“But how can we cross that desolation?” Bannon asked.Nicci scanned the landscape. “We should go around, skirt the valley to thenorth, stick to the greener areas in the foothills.”“In fact, I suggest we visit one of those villages,” Nathan suggested. “I’d liketo learn what happened down there, if that was once a great fertile valley.” Hescrewed up his face in a distasteful expression. “It does not appear natural.”Nicci bit her lower lip. “Agreed. Lord Rahl will need to know.”“And the world may need saving, Sorceress,” Nathan said, without any obvioushint of humor. She did not respond.As the path descended, they worked their way into the badlands, where rockstowered like monoliths, reddish sandstone eroded by wind and water. Thevegetation transitioned from tall pines to gnarled scrub oak, mesquite, andspiky yucca that had survived as the terrain grew less hospitable.In the heat of the day, Nicci packed away her traveling cloak. Her black dresswas comfortable, but the rocks underfoot were hard through the soles of herboots. Bannon’s face quickly became sunburned.Their road took the path of least resistance, following the curves of theslickrock bluffs and winding into rocky arroyos. Pebbles pattered down fromabove, and they saw skittering movement—lizards darting from sunny rocks intoshadowy crevices.Nicci listened to the silence punctuated by stray breezes and the rustle oftwigs. She narrowed her eyes, sensing movement from something larger than alizard. She and Nathan were instantly alert, while Bannon kept plodding,distracted by the scenery. Then he also stopped. “What is it? Are we beingstalked?” He drew his sword.“I don’t know,” Nicci said. “I heard something.” She remained motionless,extending her senses, trying to pick up on some unseen threat.They waited in tense silence. Nathan frowned. “Actually, I don’t hear anything.”Suddenly, they heard a burst of bright and refreshing laughter, the high voiceof a child. All three looked at the rocks overhead, the smooth bluffs marredwith occasional blind ledges. A young girl stood up from a hiding place above.Small-statured and elfin, she looked about eleven years old.“Been watching you for a long time.” She placed her hands on her hips andgiggled again. “I wondered how long it would take for you to notice. I was goingto surprise you!”She looked like a waif dressed in rags. She had an unruly mop of dusty brownhair that was styled more in tangles than curls. Her honey-brown eyes twinkledas she regarded them. She had caramel-colored skin and a triangular face with anarrow chin and high cheekbones. Her arms were wiry, her legs spindly beneath anuneven skirt made of patchwork cloth. Four large lizards dangled by their tailsfrom a rope tied around her waist; the lizard heads were smashed and bloody.“Wait for me,” she called. “I’m coming down.”“Who are you?” Nicci said.“And why have you been spying on us?” Nathan demanded.Like a lizard herself, the girl scrambled down the rock wall, finding hand- andfootholds that were all but invisible, but she displayed no fear of falling. Herfeet were covered with moccasins made of rope, fabric, and scraps of leather.She dropped the last five feet, landing in a resilient crouch on the rocks infront of them. The lizard carcasses at her hip flopped back and forth.“I am spying on you because you’re strangers—and because you’re interesting.”She looked up. “My name is Thistle.”“Thistle?” Bannon asked. “That’s an odd name. Is it because you’re prickly?”“Or maybe I’m just hard to get rid of—like a weed. I’m from the village ofVerdun Springs. Is that where you’re going? I can take you there.”“We’re not sure where we’re going,” Nicci said. “Are you all alone here?”“Me and the lizards,” said Thistle. “And there aren’t as many lizards nowbecause I’ve had a good hunt today.” She squatted next to them and opened apouch on her other hip. “I don’t often see people. I’m usually the only one whogoes out exploring. Everyone else in Verdun Springs works all day just tosurvive.”She tugged open the pouch’s drawstring and pulled out strips of dried, grayishmeat. “These are yesterday’s lizards. Do you want some? They dried allafternoon, so the meat will be just right.” She put a strip into her mouth,seized it with her front teeth, and tore it into shreds. As she chewed andswallowed, she kept holding out her other hand to extend the offering of meat.Bannon, Nicci, and Nathan each took a small portion of dried lizard. Bannonlooked at it skeptically, but the wizard munched away without hesitation. “Myuncle Marcus and aunt Luna taught me about hospitality,” said Thistle. “They saywe should be kind to strangers because maybe they can help us.”“We might be able to help,” Nicci said, thinking about her broader quest. “Firstwe need to learn what happened here. How far is your village?”“Not far. I’ve only been out two days, and I have enough supplies for a week.Marcus and Luna won’t be expecting me back home yet.” Thistle’s grin widened.“They’ll be surprised when I bring visitors. You sure you can help us? Can youstop the Scar from growing?” She gave them a frank assessment, then sniffed. “Idon’t think you’re strong enough.”“The Scar?” Bannon asked.“She must mean the desolation,” Nathan said. “The whole valley ahead.”“We call it the Scar, because that’s what it looks like,” Thistle said. “I’veheard stories of how beautiful the valley used to be when I was just a baby.Farmlands and orchards and forests—they even had flower gardens. Can youimagine?” She snorted. “Flower gardens! Wasting water, fertilizer, and good soiljust to grow flowers!”Nicci felt sad for the girl, and her innocent comment was a poignant indicationof what sort of life the people in her village must be enduring as thedevastation expanded.She continued to chatter. “If you can save us, if you can break theLifedrinker’s spell and bring the fertile lands back, how I would love to seeit! All my life I’ve dreamed of making the land beautiful again.” She sprang toher feet, ready to go. She trotted off, calling over her shoulder, “Do youreally think you can destroy the Lifedrinker?”“Who is the Lifedrinker?” Nathan asked.Nicci cautioned, “We did not promise we could do anything.”When the girl shook her head, the tangled brown curls bobbed about like weeds.“Everyone knows about the Lifedrinker! The evil wizard at the heart of the Scarwho sucks the life out of the world to feed his own emptiness.” She lowered hervoice. “That’s what my uncle Marcus says. I don’t really know anything more.”“Won’t your uncle be worried about you alone in the wilderness for days?” Nicciasked.“I can take care of myself.” Thistle set off with a pert stride, skipping overthe stones. Without slowing, she bent to snatch rocks in her right hand and keptmoving down the wash, knowing that they would follow. “I’ve raised myself sincemy parents died when I was just a little girl. Uncle Marcus and Aunt Luna tookcare of me, but they didn’t have any extra food or water, so I have to feedmyself most of the time, and I try to bring in enough to help them.”Thistle jerked her head to the left, focused on a flash of movement she hadspotted. Quicker than even Nicci could see, the girl hurled the rocks. Theyclacked, clattered, and struck their target, and she bounded ahead and squatteddown to retrieve a small lizard she had just killed. Thistle held it up, pursingher lips. “Almost too tiny to be worth the effort.” Nevertheless, she tucked itamong the other carcasses at her waist. “Aunt Luna says never to waste food.Food is hard enough to come by these days.”The energetic girl led them along at a pace that Nicci had trouble matching.Nathan and Bannon started to slow down as they trudged over the rough rocks.Thistle scampered along, overjoyed to have company. “You’re very pretty,” shesaid to Nicci. “What is your home like? Where do you come from?”“I am from far to the north,” Nicci said. “In the New World.”“This is the only world I know. Are there trees where you live? And water?Flowers?”“Yes. And cities … and even flower gardens.”Thistle frowned. “Flower gardens? Why would you leave such a nice place to comehere?”“We didn’t know we were coming here. We’re on a long journey.”“I’m glad you came,” Thistle said. “You can fight the Lifedrinker. You’ll find away to restore the valley and the whole world.”Nicci felt a chill as she recalled Red’s words. “Maybe that’s why we’re here.”“We will do exactly that, child,” Nathan said, “if it’s within our power.”They worked their way along the widening arroyo and around the bluffs to wherethe last line of trees had died and the creeks had long since dried up. Thistlegestured proudly ahead. “This is my village.”Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon stopped to look. They were not impressed.Verdun Springs had obviously been a much larger town once, thriving at theintersection of imperial roads, forest paths, and commercial routes that ledinto the fertile farmland and trading villages deep in the valley. But thecluster of low mud-brick buildings had retracted into a squalid settlement, asif the population had dried up as well as the landscape.Dust skirled along the streets. Rocks had been dumped in piles next to abuilding. A cart with a broken wheel—and no horse to draw it—leaned against therubble mound. Countless empty buildings were covered with dust, some of themfalling apart.Nicci counted no more than twenty people toiling under the harsh sunlight. Theywore frayed clothes and floppy hats woven from dry grass. Several men wereworking around the town’s well. One man lowered himself by a rope down into thestone-walled shaft. “Keep digging! If we go deep enough, we’re sure to findclear water again.” Others tugged on a second rope attached to a pulley, drawingup a bucket that held only mud and dirt.To announce their arrival, Thistle let out a loud, shrill whistle. The man atthe well looked up, and the other haggard people stopped to stare. Thistlecalled out, “This is my uncle Marcus—I told you about him. Uncle, this woman isa sorceress, and the old man is a wizard, but he doesn’t have any magic.”“I still have my magic,” Nathan corrected. “It’s just not accessible at themoment.”“The other one is named Bannon,” Thistle continued. “I don’t know what he cando.” The young man frowned in annoyance.Marcus was a skinny man with dark brown hair going to gray and a bristly beard.His shirt was splattered with mud from helping at the well; he wore a faded,scuffed leather vest. “I welcome you to Verdun Springs, strangers, but I havelittle hospitality to offer. None of us does.”“I brought lizards!” Thistle said.“Why, then we can have a feast.” Marcus smiled. “You always bring more than yourshare, Thistle. Our family will eat well tonight—and so will our guests.”Aunt Luna also introduced herself, a dark-skinned woman in a drab skirt with ascarf of rags tied around her head. Though faded now, the scarf had once beenbright red. In front of her home Luna had been tending large clay planters,turning rich, dark dirt fertilized with human night soil. Each planter held asplash of green vegetables. Luna wiped her hands on her skirts and tousled thegirl’s mop of hair. “We may even find some vegetables that are ready. Better toeat them as soon as they’re ripe than let the Lifedrinker have them.”Thistle sniffed. “As long as the vegetables are in the pots, the Lifedrinkercan’t touch them. He can’t reach through the planters.”“Maybe he just doesn’t try hard enough,” said her aunt, adjusting the drab redhead scarf.The villagers muttered. The Lifedrinker’s name seemed to fill them with dread.“We’re glad you could come,” said Marcus, leading them down the main street. “Ifyou visited any of the other towns nearby, you’d find them all empty. VerdunSprings is all that remains. The rest of the people went away, or just …disappeared. We don’t know.” He wiped dust from his forehead.“Why didn’t you pack up and leave?” Nathan asked, gesturing around at thedesolation of the village, the drying well, the dusty streets. “Surely you couldfind a better place to live than this.”“Someday this will be a lush valley again, as it was a decade ago. We know howbeautiful it can be,” Luna said, and the few villagers next to her nodded.Thistle beamed. “I can only imagine it.”Luna said, “I’ve urged my husband to pack up and go into the mountains. We hearthere may be other towns up and over the ridge, even an ocean if you walk farenough west.” She heaved a great sigh. “An ocean! I can’t remember so muchwater. At the time when Thistle was born, there was a lake in the valley, beforethe Scar spread that far.”“We won’t leave.” Marcus brushed dried mud from his leather vest. “We will ekeout our existence day by day.” He squared his shoulders and added with greatpride, “We are hardy people.”“Hardy?” Nicci raised her eyebrows, thinking that “foolhardy” was a betterdescription."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 37 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch37]When night fell, Nicci and her companions sat around a fire pit outside ofMarcus and Luna’s home, which was built from mud bricks. The house was spaciousand cool, with a large central room, wooden beams across the open, airy ceiling,and small high windows below a clay tile roof. The large home reflected a moreprosperous time.Sitting outside in the warm dusk as they prepared for the evening meal, Nathanand Bannon told the adults the story of their journeys, and Nicci explainedabout Lord Rahl’s new golden age, though it was clear that neither Marcus norLuna took hope.“We can barely find enough water to survive,” said Marcus, “and our food israpidly dwindling. As I told you, the other towns that once filled this valleytwenty years ago are silent and dead.” He pressed his hands together, hunchedhis shoulders, and looked at Nicci. “I am glad to hear of the overthrow oftyrants, but can your Lord Rahl come to our aid? The Scar keeps growing.”Nicci narrowed her eyes. “We are here. Now. But we need to know more about theLifedrinker.”Worry lines seamed Nathan’s face. “I am not convinced how much assistance I canoffer, Sorceress—at least until we get to Kol Adair.”Thistle sat cross-legged in the dust next to Nicci as she cleaned the freshlizards for dinner. “Kol Adair? That’s far away.” The girl used her littlebloody knife to skin another of the lizards, inserted a stick through the bodycavity, and handed it to Bannon, so he could roast it over the low cook fire inthe pit. Somewhat queasy, the young man lowered the carcass over the coals, andsoon the flesh began to bubble and sizzle.Bannon wiped a hand across his mouth while turning the stick over the cook fireso the lizard didn’t burn. “How fast is the Scar growing?”“In twenty years, the entire valley died away, and the devastation continues tospread,” Luna said. “We are one of the last villages on the outskirts.”“The Scar grows faster as the Lifedrinker becomes more powerful … and hisappetite is insatiable,” Marcus added. “I remember when the heart of the valleystarted dying, just before Luna and I were married. But we’ll stay here. We’velasted this long.”The night was silent, but the breezes carried an ashy breath with bitterchemical taint. At the scattered mud-brick houses or larger quarried-stonestructures around the town, quiet villagers ate their own meals outside, keepingapart from one another. Verdun Springs had fallen into a sullen hush, as ifcaused by the mention of the Lifedrinker’s name.Luna looked sad. “Verdun Springs used to have a population of a thousand, andnow fewer than a dozen families remain.”“We are the strongest twenty,” Marcus insisted. It was clear they had had thisargument before.Bannon said, “There are forests and farmlands on the other side of themountains, plenty of places for you to settle and be happy.”“It would only delay our fate,” said Marcus, with a stubborn frown. “The Scar isspreading, and sooner or later the Lifedrinker will swallow the world.”Nicci hardened her voice. “Unless someone stops him.”Thistle retained a thread of optimism. “I want to stay until the land growsfertile and beautiful again—the way it was before my parents died. I rememberit … just a little.”“You were too young,” said Marcus.The spunky girl finished cleaning the smallest lizard, which she cooked forherself. She licked the blood off her fingers and left a smear of red on theside of her mouth. Nicci reached forward to wipe off the stain. “Your face iscovered with dust.”“We don’t have much opportunity to wash,” Marcus explained.Giggling, Thistle licked her fingers and smeared saliva over some of the dust,which did little to clean her face.The travelers had supplemented the meal by offering dried fruits and leftoversmoked fish from their pack. The smoked redfin from Renda Bay was quite anovelty to the young girl, who frowned at the taste and announced that shepreferred her fresh lizards.Nicci got back to business. “Who is the Lifedrinker? And how can he be defeated?Does he have weaknesses?” Maybe this was indeed the reason why they had beendriven here. She remembered the witch woman’s words: And the Sorceress must savethe world.Marcus ground his heel in the dust. “We don’t know the full story. We’re justsimple villagers affected by that ever-growing stain. But we know he was awizard from Cliffwall, and something went terribly wrong.” He nibbled on thelast shreds of meat on the roast lizard, picking specks of flesh from the bones,and then he crunched the bones, appreciating every morsel. “That’s where you’llfind the means to destroy him—if it can even be done.”“And what is Cliffwall?” Nathan asked.“A great archive of magical lore. We thought it was a place of legend forcenturies,” Luna said.Thistle piped up. “It’s real—I’ve seen it!”“You haven’t wandered that far, child,” chided Marcus.“I have! It was four days’ walk up into the plateau, but I made it.”“It was hidden since the time of the ancient wizard wars,” Luna said, “but itreappeared fifty years ago.”The wizard raised his eyebrows and looked over at Nicci. “A great archive? Itsounds like a place we should investigate, regardless. We may find something tohelp my … condition, even before we reach Kol Adair.” He stroked his chin. “Aswell as the background on the Lifedrinker, of course.”Thistle’s honey-brown eyes sparkled. “I can take you there. I’ve seen it with myown eyes!”“Now, girl…” Marcus gave her a scolding look.“It is said that someone broke Cliffwall’s camouflage spell decades ago,” Lunasaid. “The location is still secret, but the hidden people who guarded the placeinvited a few outside scholars from the towns in the valley. That hasn’thappened in a long time, not since the Scar started to spread and consume allthe towns and farms.”The lonely breeze picked up, carrying more dust in the wind. Nicci heard the cryof a hunting night bird and something stirring in the empty houses.Unexpectedly, she saw shadows moving in the dark alleys between the abandonedstone structures. She sat up straighter, suddenly alert, trying to penetrate thedarkness with her gaze.She also sensed magic in the air—not the usual pervasive vibration that shecould always touch. Since arriving in Verdun Springs, she had felt an odd andunsettling note that seeped out of the Scar, but now it suddenly swelled, likethe flush of heat just after an oven door was opened. Tense, she rose to herfeet and tossed the cooking stick and the last scraps of her roast lizard aside.She stepped away from the fire pit and out into the wide, dry street.Before Marcus or Luna could ask her what was wrong, the night filled withscreams."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 38 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch38]Things moved in the night beyond the quiet rustling dust. The terrified criescame from one of the few inhabited houses on the outskirts of the village, wherean old man and his wife had been brooding outside by their small fire.Nicci was already running, her black dress just a deeper shadow in the darkness.Another scream. She bounded toward the old couple’s cook fire, saw manysilhouettes as the gray-haired man and woman struggled against figures thatclosed around them.The attackers looked gaunt and skeletal, lit by the orange flickers of the smallfire. Without thinking, Bannon sprinted along beside her, drawing Sturdy fromits scabbard. Ahead, Nicci saw that the attackers were the desiccated remnantsof humans, their skin sucked dry of all moisture and baked brown like driedmeat.Running hard, Thistle caught up with Bannon and Nicci. “Dust people! They’venever come into town before.”Three shriveled reanimated corpses closed around the old couple, who fought backwith helpless terror. They had no weapons, but Nicci did. The sorceress sweptout a hand and released her magic. A hammer blow of wind knocked one of the dustpeople into the air as if he were no more than chaff. When he struck the brickside of the house, his body broke apart, crumbling like twigs and straw.The old woman battered at her attacker, raking the dried flesh with her nails,but the mummified figure wrapped its arms around her. Immediately, the dryground beneath their feet changed, becoming no more substantial than foamywater. The desiccated thing pulled the old woman down, dragging her into the pitof dust until they vanished underground.Seeing his wife disappear, the old man fought even more frantically. A strongblow from his hand knocked the mummified creature’s skull loose, but evenheadless, the thing grappled with him. The ground turned to soup beneath the oldman’s feet, and he sank in up to his knees. He gave a despairing wail, reachingout for something to hold on to.Nicci struck out with her magic again, the blow of concentrated air so sharp andforceful that it shattered the old man’s undead attacker.But four more hideous dust people boiled up out of the ground, emerging from thesoft dirt like striking vipers, and together they grabbed the old man anddragged him under. His screams were drowned in sand and dust.Nicci and Bannon arrived too late. The ground had smoothed over, the attackersgone and leaving only ripples of dry dust.Bannon crouched with his sword upraised, alert for a continued attack as heturned from side to side in search of other enemies. Nicci grabbed his shirt andpulled him back from where the ground had become dry quicksand.Then, from additional houses around the dying town, shouts echoed through thenight—more people being attacked.Nathan finally reached them, holding his sword as well. “What are the attackers?Have you seen them?”“Dust people,” Thistle said. “The Lifedrinker swallows up people wherever hecan, and then makes them into his puppets.”Nicci stood close to the girl. “Stay safe.”“Where is safe?” she asked, and Nicci had no answer for her.Darkness filled the streets of Verdun Springs, and the cook fires and lamps inthe stone houses shed far too little light for certainty, but the groundstirred. The wind picked up, carrying a choking fog of dust into the town.Nicci cautiously led her group back toward the center of town. “Stay with me.”The normally placid dirt streets squirmed, stirred, and gave birth to morehorrors. Skeletal hands rose up from the dirt, showing long clawed nails andgray-brown skin that had hardened around the knuckles. The dry ground became asfluid as water, and dust people swam to the surface to hunt the last hardysurvivors.Grasping mummified hands surged around Nathan’s feet, reaching for his darkboots. One latched on, but he swept down with his sword to sever the arm bonesbefore kicking the clutching hand loose.Bannon ran forward, using Sturdy to chop one of the reanimated corpses throughthe rib cage, scattering vertebrae, but the cadaverous creatures came on like anarmy of horrific puppets, boiling up from the ground.Nicci blasted them with magic, knocking two creatures away from Thistle beforeshe grabbed the girl’s arm.Bannon slashed apart another reanimated attacker, then cleaved one more down themiddle with his backstroke. As he lunged toward a third, though, the dirt streetturned into powdery soup beneath his feet, and he stumbled. He let out aterrified yelp as he started to sink, but the wizard was there to catch hiswrist and wrench him back out of the dust trap.In the center of town, a raised dais of bricks and tile stood empty, a stage onwhich minstrels might have performed at one time, or where town leaders gavespeeches. “Go to the stone platform!” Nicci cried.Still holding Bannon’s arm, Nathan staggered and lost his balance as the groundshifted again. They both stumbled, but struggled ahead in the direction of thestone platform. Nicci used her magic to push them, lifting them up enough thatthey could escape the slurry of dust. Once on stable ground again, the menscrambled toward the raised dais, a safe island.From the terrified screams that rang out around the town, Nicci realized thatdust people were attacking other families, destroying other homes. She had toget her companions to safety before she could try to protect anyone else.Bounding ahead on skinny legs, Thistle gasped as the dirt street collapsedbeneath her feet. She plunged in up to her waist, flailing, but Nicci grabbedher. With a great heave, she pulled the girl out and away from the graspinghands of more dust people. Nicci tossed Thistle closer to the stone platform,and the scrawny girl rolled, sprang to her feet, and ran the rest of the waythere.Extending her hand, palm out, Nicci turned in a half circle, using magic toknock the desiccated attackers back, and finally joined her companions on thedais. The tiles were stable beneath their feet, but mummified corpses keptcoming for them.Bannon and Nathan stationed themselves on opposite corners of the platform,their swords held high, and they hacked apart any of the dust people whoapproached. When the dry, shambling monsters closed in, Nicci thought of thebrittle dead wood the villagers had collected for their cook fires. Everythinghere in the Scar was dry as a tinderbox, hard, dense … flammable.She released a flow of magic to increase the temperature inside the attackers,igniting a spark. Gouts of hot orange fire burned from their chests, but even onfire, the scarecrowish cadavers lurched forward. The smell of burning sinew andbone filled the air, and greasy black smoke rose up from each staggering form.Nathan and Bannon kept hacking with their swords. A defiant Thistle had pulledout her skinning knife.Most of the screams in the outlying buildings had fallen ominously silent, butnearby shouts sounded like familiar voices. Thistle cried out, “That’s UncleMarcus and Aunt Luna. I have to get home!”From a distance, Nicci could see the girl’s protectors trying to fight off acombined onslaught from the dust people. Thistle tried to bolt toward them, butNicci grabbed her shoulder. “You can’t run. The streets will swallow you up.”“I have to. We’ve got to save them!”Nicci did indeed have to save Thistle’s aunt and uncle—or at least try.“We can fight our way through,” Bannon said, lopping off the head of a driedattacker with his sword. It bounced on the ground and rolled like a hollowgourd.“We’ll never make it,” Nathan said. “In three steps, the ground would suck usdown.”From their questionable sanctuary, they watched Marcus smash one of the dustpeople with a rock from the fire pit. Luna’s red scarf drooped as she thrashedat the attackers, one wooden cooking skewer in each hand. The woman jabbed ahardened stick straight through the empty eye socket of the closest monster, buteven with the shaft through its skull, the thing kept coming.In a flash of planning, Nicci envisioned how best to run from the stone platformall the way to Thistle’s home. “I need to make a safe path.” The open dirtstreets were deadly, unless she could change the substance of the ground itself,prevent the dust from becoming a possible conduit. She directed a flow of magicinto the dirt and sand, using Additive Magic to coalesce and create, to fuse thegrains together. The loose dust cemented into a narrow walkway, as if she hadjust frozen part of a stream. “Run! They might still break through, but itshould stop them for now and give us the time we need. Run!”The others did not question her. Together, they leaped from the safety of theraised platform. Nicci sprinted ahead, feeling the vitrified sand crunch beneathher boots. She could feel the vibrations as frustrated dust people moved underthe ground, trying to break through the barrier with bony claws. The hardsurface needed to last for only a few seconds, just long enough for them to run.They finally reached Thistle’s home. Her aunt and uncle were scratched andbloody, wounded by the claws of the dust people they had fended off. Luna’sfaded red head scarf had been knocked askew, and she pushed it back out of hereyes. Nicci loosed another flow of power to ignite the two nearest attackers asshe shouted to the other woman, “Take Thistle and get inside!”Marcus and Luna staggered to the doorway. The floor of their home was made ofclay tile; Nicci hoped it would grant enough safety against an attack frombelow.The house offered very few defenses, but this was their last shelter. Freed fromthe grasping hands of the undead creatures, Marcus and Luna retreated deeperinside.Bannon and Nathan hacked apart two more dust people at the threshold, beforethey all crowded through the door. Behind them, the pathway of fused sandcracked, then shattered apart, and the dust people emerged from underground,pushing aside the hard slabs.Marcus and Luna huddled in a corner of the home, holding each other. Lunasobbed, while Marcus opened and closed his mouth as if trying to think ofsomething defiant to say. When the two saw that Thistle was all right, theycried out with relief and gestured for her to come over.Nathan slammed the wooden door and threw the crossbar into place, but it was aflimsy barricade. Soon enough, the mummified creatures were pounding on it,scratching with their claws. The joined planks began to crack and splinter.Nicci surveyed the home, studying its possible defenses. Bannon and the oldwizard stood back-to-back with their swords ready as the thudding continuedagainst the door. It would only be moments before the dust people surged inside.Thistle’s eyes were wild, but determined as she stood next to Nicci. “Are wesafe?”Luna reached out her arms. “Come here, girl. We’ll be safe together.”Before Thistle could start to where her aunt and uncle huddled, the hard claytiles in the corner dissolved into a soup, and the floor opened up like atrapdoor into a hunter’s pit. Luna and Marcus screamed as skeletal hands grabbedthem by the legs and hauled them under.Nicci rushed to help them, but at that moment, the barricaded door shattered,and an army of dust people boiled inside. Nathan and Bannon stood to block them,sweeping their swords from side to side. Both were grimly silent as they foughtwith all their strength.Nicci felt tiles shift beneath her boots as the foundation gave way. Glancingup, looking for any way out, she spotted the iron-hard wooden crossbeams thatextended across the ceiling of the mud-brick structure. The beams led to anupper window that was open to the night and the roof. It was their only way out.“Thistle, I’m going to throw you up there. Grab the beam and work your way overto the window.” She snatched up the scrawny girl. Without arguing, Thistlereached out her hands, and Nicci tossed her high enough that she could grab thecrossbeam and nimbly swing her thin legs over it. Once she caught her balance,Thistle scooted along the beam toward the high open window.Nicci turned to the two men. “Bannon, Nathan, we’ve got to get up there.”“You’re going to throw me up there too, Sorceress?” Nathan asked, then swungback to cleave the dried skull of another attacker. “Do you think I can fly?”“Not flying, but with magic, I will control the air and change your weight. Ican move you.”Without further ado, she released her power and yanked Nathan up high enough tograsp the crossbeam; then she did the same for Bannon. Not expecting it, theyoung man flailed and nearly dropped his sword, but managed to grab on to thebeam without losing Sturdy.Thistle had scooted her way to the window. The two men, balanced on thecrossbeams overhead, reached down, and Nicci jumped, stretching out her hands asten of the staggering monsters lurched into the dwelling. Bannon and Nathandeftly caught her and swung her up.Dust people filled the confined home, reaching up toward the open ceiling, butthey could not get to their four potential victims overhead.At the open window, Thistle looked back and stared at the empty corner that hadjust swallowed her aunt and uncle. Tears streamed down her narrow face, carvingtracks through the dust there.“Climb out onto the roof,” Nicci said. “We should be safe up there.” Just then,the base of the home’s mud-brick walls shifted and started to crumble, as if thehardened structure were beginning to dissolve back into dust. “Quickly!”Thistle scampered through the window and swung herself onto the tiled roof,while Bannon and Nathan followed with as much urgency. Sliding along the woodencrossbeam behind them, Nicci looked down to see more dust people rising from thebroken floor. The walls shivered with rapidly spreading cracks.She realized that even the rooftop would not be a place of safety.The group sat gasping for breath out in the open night air and heard the hollowhiss of an army of dust people plodding through the streets of Verdun Springs.Thistle’s entire home began to collapse beneath them. One wall sank down,destabilizing the roof, and loose clay tiles clattered like broken teeth to theground. Bannon tried to keep his balance, but slipped and scrabbled as tilesbroke under him. He was able to snag a wooden anchor beam, and Nathan grabbedthe back of his shirt and hauled him back up to temporary safety.Nicci stood at the roof’s apex, searching for any possible escape. The orphangirl ran to the other end of the roof and pointed to an adjacent stonestructure, a square, flat-roofed shop building made of quarried blocks ratherthan mud bricks. “Over here! This looks safer!”The gap between the buildings was six feet wide. But with desperation, and apossible nudge of magic, the four ran across the crumbling tile roof, jumped,and all landed on the flat, open roof of the stone building.Behind them, Thistle’s home collapsed, the brick walls crumbling, the roofsagging inward. The girl watched in dismay.Standing on the roof of the much sturdier building, Bannon stomped with hisboot. “At least this roof is solid beneath our feet, made of old wood,reinforced. And these stone-block walls won’t collapse so easily.”Nathan pointed out an opening in the roof, which led down into the main shopbelow. “But those creatures could follow us, climb onto the roof.”Pursuing them, the dust people tore open the unlocked door below and burst intothe abandoned shop. They made their inexorable way upward, climbing the stairsto the open roof.“We are still trapped.” Nicci scanned toward the edge of town, the rocky bluffsand canyons on the outskirts of Verdun Springs. “If we can get out there awayfrom town, in among the bluffs, the dust people won’t be able to attack fromunderground. Maybe we can defend ourselves in the stone outcroppings.”“It’s much too far,” Bannon said from the edge of the rooftop, swallowing hard.“And those things are much too close,” Nathan added.“They are slow-moving … unless they ambush us,” Nicci said.With gasping, scratching sounds, two dust people clambered to the top of thestairs and emerged onto the shop roof, climbing through the trapdoor. With aswift kick, Nicci knocked both stick figures back down the steps, but morecadavers surged up the interior stairs.Nicci looked around into the night and realized that the rest of the town hadfallen silent. There were no more screams.“Are we the only ones left?” Thistle whispered.Nicci did not give any excuses. “Yes. But we will get out of here.”They watched in dismay as two recently inhabited brick buildings also sagged andcollapsed as the Lifedrinker’s magic turned the brick structures into dust.Angry, Nicci focused on the rugged bluffs outside of town—a place of sanctuarywhere the solid ground would protect them. Better than here.“Be ready,” she said. “I’m going to fuse the dust like I did before. I’ll makeanother path for us to run on, and it won’t last long. And the other dust peoplewill come after us as swiftly as they can. We just have to be faster.” Sheturned to the young girl. “Can you do it?”“Of course I can,” Thistle said. “Say when.”Nicci gauged the most direct path to the bluffs outside of town. She gestured.“That way. Don’t look back. Don’t stop for anything—just run. I’ll make theground hard, but we still have to jump off the roof.”“I would make a comment about my old bones,” Nathan said, “but now isn’t thetime.”Bannon pointed down. “I’m more worried about those old bones.”Nicci unleashed her magic and marked a path. With Additive Magic she created asolid structure, melding the sand and dust into flat, hard islands.Stepping-stones, since she did not have enough strength left to solidify thewhole area. This would be enough. She made one appear, then another.“Go!” she shouted. “I’ll make the rest along the way.”Without hesitation, Thistle leaped off the roof and landed in the soft dirt.Before the dust people could respond, she sprang onto the nearest hardenedstepping-stone, then jumped to the next, running ahead. Nicci dropped after her,following close behind so she could reach out and keep creating the path as fastas the girl could run.Nathan and Bannon tumbled down after them. By now, some of the dust peoplerealized what their intended victims were doing, and the sticklike mummiesstreamed around the remaining town structures. Two dry cadavers rose up to theleft of Thistle, dodging the hardened sand. Seeing this, Nicci reacted with anangry snarl and thrust with a blast of air, which smashed the dust people tosplinters of bone and dried flesh.But more came.Nicci and the girl ran toward the rock outcroppings, with Bannon and Nathanclose behind. They fled the abandoned town. When they finally reached the hardrocks, Thistle scrambled up the outcropping, finding hand- and footholds as sheclimbed higher away from the dust people. The other three followed her, crawlingup the pocked bluff walls until they reached the relative safety of a solidoutcropping.Thistle didn’t want to stop. “I know a way, follow me. If we go deeper into thecanyons, they’ll never find us.”Together, they fled into the night. Climbing higher into the rocks, Nicciglanced over her shoulder in time to see the last of the brick buildingscollapse into dust. Then even the stone buildings began to shift as the groundunderneath melted away and swallowed them. Soon enough, all sign of VerdunSprings had vanished forever."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 39 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch39]Even terrified and in shock, Thistle knew her way through the dark wilderness.Moving solely on adrenaline, she guided them by starlight along smooth slickrockledges farther into the canyons, far from the reach of the dust people. Theywere all too exhausted and shaken to engage in conversation. The girl wasobviously struggling to absorb what she had just been through, but she survivedwith a furious lightning-bolt determination that Nicci admired.Finally, the companions reached the top of the bluffs, high above any threatfrom the Lifedrinker’s minions, and Thistle squatted on a flat rock under thestars. Her thin legs and knobby knees stuck up in the air; her shouldersslumped. She rested her hands on her patchwork skirt and just stared into theempty distance.Nicci stood beside her. “I believe we are safe now. Thank you.”Thistle began trembling, and Nicci didn’t know how to comfort her.Fortunately, the wizard came up and bent down next to her. “I am terribly sorry,child. That was your home, your aunt and uncle.…”“They took care of me,” Thistle said in a quavering voice. “But I spent most ofmy time alone. I was fine—and I will be fine.” She looked up with fierydetermination, but when her honey-brown eyes met Nicci’s, they filled withtears. Her lips quivered and her shoulders began to shake. “Uncle Marcus andAunt Luna always said I was too much responsibility for them to handle. Tooprickly.” She sniffled, and Nicci could see her iron-hard strength. “I will befine.”“I know you will,” Nicci said. “Truly I do.”A moment later, the girl broke down into sobs, rubbing her eyes. Bannonawkwardly put an arm around her shoulders, like a big brother. She turned,embraced him, and cried into his chest. The young man blinked, not sure what todo in the storm of grief. Reflexively, he held her in return.“We will rest here,” Nicci announced, looking around at their high ground. “Thisplace is defensible. We can move on in the morning.”“Nowhere is safe,” Thistle said in a harder voice. She shook herself. “Exceptwith you. We’ll all be safe together.”Nicci took first watch while the others tried to sleep. They had lost theirpacks and traveling supplies during their frantic flight, but they made do.Nicci had her magic to assist them, but she suspected that Thistle’s survivalabilities would be essential to their mission, even if they headed away from thespreading desolation.Bannon and Nathan stretched out on the open rock, trying to rest. Exhausted, theold wizard slept soundly, and his eyes fell half closed, so Nicci could see onlythe whites between his lids. She was used to the fact that wizards slept withtheir eyes open, an eerie habit that unsettled those unaccustomed to seeing it.Now, though, she was more disturbed to realize that Nathan Rahl’s eyes weremostly closed. Perhaps it was another indication of how much of his magic he hadlost since the world had changed. He was no longer whole. How had Red known whatlay in store for them?Nicci sat in silence, staring up at the stars, still trying to understand thenew patterns, but she could find no message there. She listened with suspicionto every rustle of underbrush and clatter of loose pebbles in the night, but thesounds were merely caused by scurrying rodents.At last she had time to think. She pondered the D’Haran Empire, the sprawlingOld World, this mostly unknown continent that Lord Rahl needed her to explore.How was she to save the world? The very idea seemed laughable. Right now, hermost immediate concern was the Lifedrinker, whatever he was. His Scar wasspreading, encompassing a greater and greater swath of land. And he had alreadyattacked them with his dust people.That was the Lifedrinker’s first mistake, Nicci thought. It was personal now.She needed to know more about the evil wizard, what his goal was, how and why hehad sucked dry those other townspeople from the valley and turned them into hisreanimated servants. Was it just his appetite? Stealing more souls, absorbingtheir energy? The Lifedrinker’s dark magic, whatever it was, had spread like apotent poison more deadly than thousands of deathrise flowers, like the one shestill kept with her, wrapped in her dress pocket.She knew they needed to find the place called Cliffwall.Having seen the people of Verdun Springs dragged beneath the dusty ground,including Thistle’s aunt and uncle, Nicci felt a powerful resolve. She had adeep hatred for oppression, for the destruction or enslavement of good people.The Lifedrinker was the epitome of tyranny, and Nicci considered it part of hermission for Richard to put an end to the threat. Prophecy or not, that was whatshe knew she had to do.The orphan girl woke before dawn, instantly alert. Thistle looked around, sawNicci, and scuttled over to be next to her. The two sat in silence for a longmoment before the girl spoke. “I can lead us to Cliffwall—I know I can. There,you’ll meet the scholars and learn the information you need to destroy theLifedrinker. I hate him! And I will take you there.”“I believe you,” Nicci said. “And you will prove it to us soon enough. Nathanand I are both scholars of magic. If the answer is there, we will find it.” Shenarrowed her blue eyes and looked down at the lost little girl. “Regardless ofwhat is in the library, I swear to you, we will find a way to rid the world ofthe man who did this.”Thistle gave a solemn nod. Unshed tears welled in her large eyes. “And afterthat, can I stay with you? I … don’t have anyone else.” When her voice crackedat the end, the girl covered it with a loud clearing of her throat. She lookedaway, as if ashamed of her desperation.Nicci could not imagine bringing this child, however talented she might be,along on their difficult journey to Kol Adair. But Thistle had already beenbroken so badly in one night that the sorceress simply answered with, “We shallsee,” rather than dashing her hopes.* * *They were ready to move as soon as dawn broke. Thistle shook Bannon and Nathanby the shoulders to wake them. “It might take several days to get to Cliffwall,and the canyonlands up in the plateau can be a maze, but if you follow me”—shegave them a forced smile—“I’ll keep you safe and on track.”Bannon tied back his loose hair. “But we don’t have any water or food. We don’thave our packs.”The girl placed her fists on her raggedy skirt and lifted her chin. “I’ll findwhat we need.” She sprang off and led them along the top of the bluff, then intoeven higher canyonlands away from the once-fertile valley that was now the Scar.The seemingly endless expanse of slickrock rippled with upthrust fins of redrock formations, like the backbones of some mythical monster.The landscape was scored with a dizzyingly complex labyrinth of cracks andcanyons, deep gorges that spilled into oblivion with no exits that Nicci couldsee. The muted reds and tans were interspersed with dark green splashes of piñonpines, mesquite scrub, even tall cacti. Down in the sheltered canyons, a fuzz ofpale green mixed with spiky black branches showed where thick tamarisks cloggedthe channels. This was a healthy desert with natural vegetation; the spreadingstain of the Lifedrinker had not extended this far … but Nicci suspected thatwould change before long.Nathan shaded his eyes and looked out across the desert highlands. “It isbeautiful, I’ll grant you that.” He placed a hand on the leather pouch thatstill held his life book, one of the few things he had managed to keep with him.“But I despair at the thought of mapping it. How can we not get lost?”Thistle said, “I already told you, I’ll be your guide. I can show you whereCliffwall has been hidden for thousands of years. I’ve explored it all. I knowwhere I’m going.”“You explored all of this?” Bannon sounded skeptical.She huffed. “I am eleven summers old.”“I see no reason to doubt her.” Nicci followed as the girl set off, prancingfrom rock to rock, scrambling up steep slopes while Bannon and Nathan workedhard to keep up.Thistle guided them along the fingers of canyon rims, then back around again toa deeper cut. As they rested, the orphan girl stayed near Nicci, and gazed backat the barren emptiness of the Scar, many miles behind them. Thistle gave a longwistful sigh, her face a mask of sadness. “I heard people talk about howbeautiful this land was once, with forests, rivers, crops. Like a paradise, theperfect place to live. When my aunt and uncle talked about it, they would beginto cry, saying how much it had changed in just my lifetime. It sounded sowonderful.” She sniffled. “That’s why Uncle Marcus and Aunt Luna insisted onstaying here. They said our valley would come back … someday.” She looked atNicci. “You’re going to bring it back, Nicci, and I’ll help you. I will!Together we’ll fight. We’ll bring all the life back to this valley.”The girl showed such adamant hope that Nicci did not wish to disappoint her.“Perhaps we will.”Toward the end of a long day of traveling, Thistle led them to the lip of a widecanyon and found an impossible trail that took them painstakingly down towardthe bottom. “There’ll be water here and a place to camp.”Indeed, Thistle knew exactly where to find an excellent shelter under anoverhang, where they built a campfire of brittle tamarisk and mesquite wood thatburned hot with fragrant smoke. A seep of water provided all they needed todrink and to wash.As twilight closed in, the girl darted off into the winding canyon and returneda short while later with four lizards for them to eat. They roasted the reptileswhole, and Nicci crunched the crispy scaled skin, bones and all.Thistle led them onward for three days, climbing higher into the plateau throughdesert scrub, mesquite, sagebrush, creosote bush, and spiky yucca. They enteredthe uplands well above Verdun Springs, circling around the foothills thatenclosed the vast valley and up into the high plateau.Eventually, as if the ground swelled as it gained altitude, the land split intomore deep canyons. Confident in where she was going, the girl wound them throughthe maze until Nicci, Nathan, and Bannon had no idea where they were or how theycould ever retrace their steps. Even so, Nicci placed her faith in the girl.As they traveled through one bright morning where the canyons widened and therock walls broke into towering hoodoos that stood like eerie and misshapensentinels, Nicci asked, “How old were you when your parents died?”“I was very little,” Thistle said. “Back then, there were still many people inVerdun Springs. The Scar hadn’t spread to our town yet, but the Lifedrinker wasdangerous even if he was far away. I remember my mother’s face … she was verybeautiful. When I think of her, I think of green trees, wide fields, runningwater, and pretty flowers … a flower garden.” She laughed at the absurd idea ofwasting garden space on mere flowers.“As the Scar absorbed the valley, my parents would try to scavenge any cropsthey could still harvest. One time, they made an expedition to an almondorchard, because even if the trees were dead, there were still dried nuts togather. My mother and father never came back.…” Thistle walked in silence for along moment, leading the group around looming hoodoos. “The Scar might lookdead, but some creatures are connected to the Lifedrinker, and he doesn’t justkill them. He changes them, uses them.”“Like the dust people?” Nicci asked.Thistle nodded. “But not just people. Also spiders, centipedes—and lice,terrible monstrous lice.”Nicci felt a twist inside of her. “I hate lice.”“Lice drink life as well,” Bannon said. “No wonder the wizard likes them.”“What killed your mother and father?” Nathan asked.“Scorpions—big scorpions had infested the almond trees, and when my parents cameto harvest the nuts, the scorpions fell upon them, stung them. When Uncle Marcusand two other villagers went to look for them days later, they found my parents’bodies, their faces all swollen from the stings … but even though they weredead, the Lifedrinker made them into dust people too. My parents attacked UncleMarcus.”Her words tapered off, and Thistle didn’t need to continue the story of what thevillagers must have done to get away. “After that, I stayed with my aunt anduncle. They said they would take care of me, that they would watch over me.” Hervoice was bleak. “Now they’re gone. Verdun Springs is gone.” She swallowed hard.“My world is gone.”“And you are with us, child,” said Nathan. “We’ll make the best of it.”Bannon pushed ahead. “Yes, we will—if we ever get to Cliffwall.”Looking up at Nicci for reassurance, the orphan girl nodded. “We’ll be there bytomorrow.”* * *The next morning Thistle led them along the floor of a canyon whose rocky bottomlooked as if it had suffered flash floods during storms, but not for some time.The sky closed in as the canyon walls rose higher and drew together, lookingsheer and impenetrable.The wizard frowned, trying to gain his bearings as the shadows lengthened. “Areyou certain this isn’t a dead end, child?”“This is the way.” Thistle trotted ahead.The canyon narrowed, and Nicci felt uneasy and vulnerable, realizing this wouldbe a perfect place for an ambush.“It closes up,” Bannon said. “Look ahead—it’s a dead end.”“No,” the girl insisted. “Follow me.”She led them up to where the rock walls formed the end of a box canyon, leavingonly what looked like a narrow crack of two mismatched slickrock cliffs. Thistleturned to the travelers, then rotated sideways and shimmied into the crack.She vanished.Nicci stepped forward to see that the crack was a cleverly hidden passagewaythat led through a narrow elbow in the blind wall. After inching her way alongthrough the claustrophobic passage, Nicci saw light ahead.The girl squirmed out and stepped into a widening canyon. Nicci joined her, andBannon and Nathan emerged behind them. Nicci caught her breath.They all drank in the view of Cliffwall."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 40 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch40]Past the bottleneck of the closed-in stone passageway, the hidden network ofcanyons on the other side of the towering barricade wall was a whole world cutoff from the rest of the landscape. Steep-walled finger canyons spread out likeoutstretched hands cutting through the high plateau. Nicci and her companionsabsorbed the view. This place was a hidden, locked-away network of secret,sheltered canyons.The main canyon through the cracked plateau was broad and fertile, cut by thesinuous silver ribbon of a stream that collected drips from numerous overflowingsprings. Sheep grazed on the lush green grasses, and fenced fields were burstingwith tall stalks of wheat and corn. Vegetable gardens crowded with squash andbeans had been laid out in confined ledge niches that pocked the cliffs.Orchards grew along the streamside, many of the trees in blossom. Wooden hutchesheld beehives that added a faint hum to the air. Hundreds of people worked thefields, tended the flocks, climbed the canyon walls on wooden ladders. It was athriving, prosperous society.All along the cliffs that enclosed the canyons, large overhangs and alcovescreated natural sheltered caves in which buildings had been constructed, claybrick and adobe buildings. Some of the natural grottoes held only two or threedwellings, while larger overhangs held a veritable city of adobe towersconnected with walkways.The opposite side of the canyon held a singularly enormous cave grotto, ayawning alcove that held imposing stone buildings with blocky façades. Thearchitecture had an air of ancient majesty. Nicci realized this must be thelegendary wizards’ archive, only recently revealed.Cliffwall was like a fortress in its huge, defensible alcove, stone-blockstructures five and ten stories high, massive square walls with defenses. Anarrow, winding path chiseled into the cliff was augmented with knotted ropesand short ladders to grant access from the canyon floor to the yawning grottoabove.Once through the bottleneck into the canyon, Nathan tilted his head back andstared in awe, his mouth agape. “It reminds me of the Palace of the Prophets.Ah, I do miss the library there.”Bannon displayed the same wide-eyed wonder Nicci had seen on his face when hewas in the city of Tanimura. “Was the Palace of the Prophets really that big?”he asked.Nathan chuckled. “Size is a relative thing, my boy. The cliffs and the overhangdefinitely make this look imposing, but the palace was at least ten times thesize.”“Ten times?” Bannon said. “Sweet Sea Mother, that can’t be possible!”“No need for comparisons,” Nicci said. “Cliffwall is impressive enough, and ithas the advantage of being intact. Perhaps we’ll find what we need to know aboutthe Lifedrinker.”In the bright daylight, some of the local people had spotted the visitorsemerging through the hidden entrance to the canyon. Two boys working a vegetableplot halfway up a cliff whistled an alarm. The shrill sound echoed andricocheted, amplified by the angled canyon walls. Others converged, respondingto the alarm.While Nicci might have preferred to reconnoiter the canyon structures to assessthe Cliffwall defenses and any possible threat, Thistle shouted and waved at thepeople coming closer. “Hello! We are strangers from the outside. We need to lookinto your archive.”More alarm whistles echoed from the alcove settlements, and in the toweringfortress of the Cliffwall archive, dozens of people bustled to the windows anddoors. Nicci couldn’t hold Thistle back as she boldly strode forward into thecanyon, confident they would all be welcome here.A group of Cliffwall dwellers hurried toward the four travelers. Thistle put herhands on the hips of her ragged dress and raised her voice. “We are here todefeat the Lifedrinker! I brought you a sorceress, a brave swordsman, and an oldwizard.”“I don’t appear that old,” Nathan said, salvaging his pride. “And I am a prophetas well as a wizard … although at present I am unable to use either of thosefaculties.” He tapped his head. “Still, the knowledge is here.”“They are here to find out how to stop the Scar,” Thistle proclaimed.Nathan looked up at the people drawing closer. “Hello! We understand you have anarchive of knowledge? Ancient records that might prove useful in dealing withthis terrible enemy that plagues the land?”Nicci added in a harder voice, “Information that will give us the tools andweapons to defeat him? We need it.”One middle-aged farmer wore a brown tunic flecked with grass ends and chaff fromcutting wheat. “You would have to see Simon for that. He’s Cliffwall’s seniorscholar-archivist.” He indicated the towering fortress alcove up the side of thecliff, where more than a dozen people were working their way in single file downthe narrow pathway to come meet them.“And Victoria. They need to see Victoria,” added a woman whose tight bun of palehair was tied in a gray scarf. She had wide hips, stubby callused fingers, andbiceps that were larger than Nathan’s and Bannon’s combined. “She’s the one whodecides what knowledge the memmers preserve.”The farmer brushed at the fragments of wheat, then placed a stalk between histeeth. “Now, now, it all depends on the type of information they need.”“We haven’t seen strangers and outside scholars for years, not since the Scarwiped out the valley,” said a red-faced shepherd who came puffing up, catchingthe end of the conversation.“The scholars have needed new blood,” said the hefty woman. “No one here hasfound a way to stop the Lifedrinker. We need help.”“Cliffwall was hidden behind a camouflage shroud for thousands of years,” saidthe redhead. “And even though the spell is gone, the spirits of our ancestorswould torment us if we simply handed over that knowledge to any bedraggledvisitor who asks! We are very careful about how many outside scholars we allowhere.”“We’re here to help,” Nicci said.“And we’re not all that bedraggled,” Nathan said.“I’m not a stranger,” Thistle insisted. “I watched you a year ago, and you nevernoticed. I’m the only survivor from Verdun Springs.”“Never heard of it,” said the shepherd.“That’s because you’ve been locked in these canyons forever,” Thistle said. “Therest of the world has gone on while you stayed hidden here. Everything is dying,and you don’t even know it.”Nicci put a hand on the girl’s shoulder to calm her. “We have come here to help.If I have the right information, maybe I can find a way to stop your enemy.”“And bring back the green valley,” Thistle insisted. “They can do it.”They all turned as the group of robed scholars hurried toward them from thetowering fortress archive. The people began to talk at once. “Simon, thesepeople came from the outside.”“This girl led them. She says she’s from a place called Verdun Springs.”“One is a sorceress and the other is a wizard.”“And a prophet.”“Victoria, look, that one’s a sorceress!”“They want to study our information, look into our archives…”“We’ve needed some fresh scholars.”Nicci tried to sort the overlapping chatter as a man stepped forward, obviouslyin charge. “I am Simon, the senior scholar-archivist of Cliffwall. I supervisethe cataloging of the knowledge preserved here by the wisdom of the ancients.”Nathan raised his eyebrows. “Senior scholar-archivist? You seem rather young forthe job.”Simon appeared to be in his mid-thirties, with thick brown hair that stuck outin unruly spikes, since he apparently didn’t have the inclination to care forit. His chin and cheeks were covered with a wispy corn silk of beard. “I’m oldenough to do my job. And I started young, brought here twenty years ago as aprodigy from one of the valley towns.”“The camouflage shroud broke down only fifty years ago,” said a matronly womanwho took her place next to him—Victoria, Nicci presumed. She was in her sixties,with gray-brown hair tied back into a braid that she wound in a coil around herhead. Her face was smooth, showing only the beginnings of crow’s-feet around hereyes, and her rounded cheeks were flushed a healthy pink. Her warm voice soundedto Nicci like the voice of a kindly grandmother from a children’s tale, but witha hard edge.“We’ve been the guardians of Cliffwall since the old wizard wars, but we haveonly recently opened the archives to outsiders again. Simon’s scholars havecompleted barely half of the cataloging work. But my memmers can perhaps explainwhat you need to know, directly from our memories—once you convince us of yourneed.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 41 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch41]Simon, Victoria, and the other intense scholars led the visitors to the fortressarchive up the sheer cliff. As they toiled up the narrow path that zigzaggedalong the rock wall, Nicci could see the size of the towering buildingsconstructed inside the cave alcove, and she grew more impressed with the ancientlibrary. The great stone façades of the Cliffwall buildings towered higher thanshe had at first guessed.“This is imposing,” she said, trying to imagine how such a mammoth city couldhave been built in such an isolated place. “Maybe the Palace of the Prophets wasonly five times larger.”Thistle scampered ahead up the precarious path, never missing a step or ahandhold. Impatient, she stopped partway and turned. “Come on, Nicci. Don’t youwant to see the library?”As Nathan climbed the rock face, he admired the huge buildings, the tower faces,the windows and arches, and the imposing primary doors, twice as high as a man.“Look at the massive stone blocks in those walls. The only way such a fortresscould have been erected—especially in this isolated canyon—is through magic.”“Powerful magic,” Nicci agreed. “In a time before so much magic was purged fromthe Old World.”The wizard paused on the steep cliff path, resting a hand against the smoothrock at his left. He nodded. “Indeed, it must have been quite an undertaking.”After clambering to the overhang of the great alcove, Thistle waited for them infront of the imposing stone buildings. “Sweet Sea Mother,” Bannon whispered.“I’ve never seen anything like it.”The matronly Victoria looked at him, a troubled expression crossing herapple-cheeked face. “Your Sea Mother had nothing to do with it, young man. Sheis far away and did not aid in the effort. This was accomplished through humanlabor, and it cost the lives and energy of many gifted wizards.”Simon turned to look at the buildings with clear reverence. “The most powerfulwizards in the world came here in secret back at the time of the ancient wizardwars. It took them years to construct and hide this place, under the greatestcloak of secrecy, but their gamble paid off. Emperor Sulachan and his purgingarmies never discovered the wealth of knowledge those wizards placed here. Thecamouflage shroud remained in place for centuries, hiding Cliffwall completelyfrom any prying eyes. Only the villagers here in the canyons even remembered itexisted.”“Until fifty years ago,” Victoria said, with obvious pride in her voice. “Andnow the preserved knowledge is available to all again.”Nicci turned to look across the canyon as afternoon shadows closed in. Some ofthe shepherds slept in tents near their flocks in the canyon-floor pastures. Inthe numerous alcoves studding the opposite cliffs, she saw other dwellings litby cook fires and lamps, but the imposing Cliffwall complex shone brighter asthe gifted scholars used magic to illuminate the library archive.“And we are studying, and practicing, as quickly as we can.” Simon soundedenthusiastic.The farthest structure at the right side of the alcove caught Nicci’s eye. Alarge tower was damaged, melted as if the stone had become candle wax. Theslickrock overhang had folded in, reminding her of a drooping eyelid. Thewindows were sealed over like an ice sculpture that had thawed, slumped, thenfrozen in a fresh cold snap.Before Nicci could ask about the damage, though, scholars opened the toweringdoors and Simon led them through the main stone gate into the front tower. “Thisis only the outer fortress, but there’s much more to Cliffwall than what you seehere. An entire complex of tunnels runs through the heart of the plateau all theway to the cliffs on the other side.”Inside the main library building, the ceilings were high and vaulted, the thickwalls made of quarried stone. Their footsteps echoed along the blue-tiled floorof the entry portico, and bright lights glowed from perpetual lamps evenlyspaced along the walls, burning with magic. The stone halls were lined withwooden shelves crowded with mismatched volumes, an odd assortment of leatherspines or rolled scrolls, even hardened clay tablets with indented symbols thatNicci didn’t recognize.Nathan hungrily ran his gaze along the shelves. “I can’t wait to start reading.”Simon chuckled. “These? Just minor overflow volumes that scholars took outbecause they looked interesting. The main vaults of knowledge are deeper insidethe mesa—and much more extensive. All manner of knowledge is preserved here.”Three lovely young acolytes came up to join Victoria, sweet-faced and eager,none of them older than twenty. The matronly woman nodded at them with a gentlesmile. “Thank you for joining us, my dears. We can use your help and attention.”She introduced them to the visitors. “These are my most dedicated acolytesAudrey, Laurel, and Sage.”The three women wore white shifts, sashed tight around their waists with afabric belt, and each girl was strikingly beautiful in her own way. Audrey hadhigh cheekbones, full lips, and rich, dark hair, almost a blue-black. Laurel hadstrawberry-blond hair that hung loose, except for a decorative braid on theside; her eyes were green, her lips were thin, and her white teeth glinted in aready smile. Sage’s deep reddish-brown hair was thick and shining, and herbreasts were the most generous of the three.Nicci and Nathan gave them a polite acknowledgment, but Bannon made a deep bow,his face flushed with embarrassment when the girls fawned over him, paying moreattention to the young man than to the others.Victoria clucked at them. “These strangers must be tired and hungry, so let useat while we hear more of their story. Go, prepare extra plates. Everyone willbe gathering for the midday meal.” The older woman smiled. “We have roastantelope and fresh corn, along with honeyed fruits and pine nuts for dessert.”Nicci was startled to realize how hungy she was. “That would be appreciated.”The wizard grinned. “And far better than munching on roasted lizards.” WhenThistle shot him an annoyed glare, he raised a conciliatory hand. “Not that wedidn’t appreciate the food, child. I just meant I was up for a bit of variety.”The dining hall held long plank tables covered with flaxen cloths. Men and womenof all ages had gathered for the midday meal. Some were engaged in lowconversation, exchanging new revelations they had found in forgotten scrolls.Many seemed too preoccupied even to notice the strangers; they wolfed down theirmeat and vegetables, then went back to their books without waiting for dessert.After they took seats on the long benches, Simon served himself a hunk of savorymeat, then passed the platter to Nicci and Nathan. As he filled his plate,Nathan said, “Please tell us more about Cliffwall, how it was constructed, andwhat it was for.”Simon accepted his tale-spinning duties as part of his role asscholar-archivist. “Three thousand years ago, at the beginning of the great war,wizards were hunted and killed in the Old World, and all magic was consideredsuspect. Emperor Sulachan sent teams to scour the land and destroy any magic hecould not acquire for himself. He and his predecessors wanted no one else tohave the powerful knowledge that had been assembled over generations.“But the wizards did not surrender so easily, and they spread word from city tocity, archive to archive. The emperor’s armies were far superior in number, andthe wizards knew that when they eventually lost, their vital knowledge would bedestroyed. So the greatest gifted scholars gathered all books of magic andprophecy and slipped them out of known libraries, hiding any volumes that couldnot be copied in time.”Thistle sat propped up on the bench, paying little attention to theconversation. She used her fingers to take a second helping of antelope meat andcorn. It was obvious she hadn’t eaten a meal like this in some time, perhaps inher entire life.Simon shifted his gaze from Nathan to Nicci. “The renegade wizards found thisplace in the maze of canyons up on the plateau, where no one could ever trackthem down. For years as Sulachan continued his conquests, the desperate wizardssmuggled contraband books, scrolls, tablets, and magical artifacts to the newhiding place. They built Cliffwall to hold that knowledge, and many of them gavetheir lives to protect it, dying under horrible torture without revealing thelocation of this canyon.“When every last book and lexicon had been stored inside the warren of chambersand shelves, the wizards knew they couldn’t rely even on the isolation of thesecanyons to keep this knowledge safe. They needed something more powerful.”“More permanent,” Victoria added.Simon’s eyes gleamed. “And so, the wizards conjured an impenetrable shield, anundetectable camouflage shroud that walled off the cave grotto. This entirecliffside was hidden. No one could see anything but a smooth, natural cliffface.”Victoria didn’t seem to like how he was telling the story. “The shroud was morethan a hiding spell, but also a physical barrier. No one could find or enter it.Cliffwall was meant to be sealed away—permanently, until those who woulderadicate magic were themselves eradicated.”Nicci glanced at Nathan. “Like Baraccus hid the Temple of the Winds, whiskingaway the most vital magical lore by sending the whole temple to the underworld,where no one could have access to it.”“And that is how so much knowledge was preserved in a time of great turmoil,”Simon finished. “Without Cliffwall and the camouflage shroud, everything wouldhave been lost in Sulachan’s purges. Instead, it remained intact here forthousands of years.”“Not everything,” Victoria said in a crisp voice. “We had our alternative.”Reluctantly conceding, Simon let the matronly woman pick up the story while hechose an ear of roasted corn from a platter. He began to eat noisily.“The physical documents were sealed in the archives,” Victoria explained, “butthe ancient wizards had a second plan to guarantee that the knowledge wouldn’tbe lost. They insured that someone would always remember. Someone special.” Shehad a twinkle in her grandmotherly eyes.“Among the people who lived quietly here in the canyons, serving as theguardians of Cliffwall, the wizards chose a few who were gifted with specialmemory abilities, perfect retention. Memmers, magically enhanced with aperfect-recall spell, who could memorize and retain all the words of countlessdocuments.”“For what purpose?” Nathan asked.“Why, to remember, of course,” Victoria said. “Before the camouflage shroud wasimposed and sealed everything away, the memmers studied the works in thearchive, committing every word to memory.” A rich undertone of pride suffusedher voice. “We are the walking manifestation of the archives. For all the yearswhen the archive was sealed, we remembered. Only we retained the knowledge.”Nicci was reminded of how Richard had memorized the entire Book of CountedShadows, line by line, page by page, back when he was just a woods guide inWestland. George Cipher had made him learn the entire book, backward andforward, burning every page after Richard had learned it, so that the evilDarken Rahl could not have access to what it contained. Even though that bookhad ultimately been a flawed copy, Richard had used that knowledge to defeatboth Darken Rahl and Emperor Jagang.But The Book of Counted Shadows was just one book. Each of these memmers hadcommitted hundreds of volumes to memory. Nicci could not comprehend theincredible scope of the memmers’ task.Victoria tapped her fingers on the tabletop. “I am one of the memmers, as areall my acolytes.” On cue, Audrey, Laurel, and Sage came into the dining hallcarrying bowls of honeyed fruit. The three young women made a point of offeringthe dessert first to an embarrassed Bannon; then they spread the plates andbowls around so that all could partake of the fruits.Nathan chose a glistening peach slice, which he savored, then licked the honeyfrom his fingers. He looked at Victoria, his forehead furrowed. “You eachcommitted thousands upon thousands of volumes to your memory? I find thatamazing—though somewhat hard to believe, I’m afraid.”Victoria’s expression puckered. “No, one person could not hold all thatknowledge, even with memory-enhancement spells and our gift. So the wizardsdivided the task among our ancestors. Each of the original memmers took specificvolumes to study. All told, with enough memmers, our predecessors preserved mostof the archive, but the books are scattered among many different minds, andthose memmers taught the next generation and the next, dispersing all the booksfurther, depending on how many memmer acolytes were available.” She tapped theside of her head. “Nevertheless, the knowledge is there.”Nicci had no interest in the sweet fruit and passed the bowl to Thistle, whobegan to paw through the dessert with her fingers. “So you have taught andrecited all these volumes for thousands of years? Losing nothing? Without amistake?”Simon said, “An expert memmer drills and practices with several acolytes,teaching them line after line, so that their students remember every word ofevery spell. In this way, the memmers kept the knowledge alive for centuries,even though the books themselves were locked away behind the permanent barrier.The camouflage shroud kept us all safe.”He paused to drink from a goblet of spring water, then wiped his mouth. Heheaved a sigh. “Unfortunately, every wizard who was powerful enough to removethe shroud also died in the ancient wars, and no one could access the knowledgehidden here. It was lost forever, the impenetrable camouflage sealed in place.No one could break through the shroud.”Victoria interrupted him. “Until I figured out how to dissolve it, thus openingthe archives again for study. Fifty years ago.” She chose three fat strawberriesand ate them quickly, then wiped her fingers and lips on a cloth napkin. “I wasjust a young woman at the time, barely seventeen.”Simon looked at the scholars up and down the plank tables, many of whom wereburied in books, focusing on the words while they ate. “Yes, and that changedeverything. After guarding the hidden archive for millennia, the canyon dwellerssuddenly had access to the vast treasure trove of information. But what werethey to do about it? They were simple villagers with quiet untroubled ways. Theyhad known little of the outside world for all this time. And even thememmers—they could recite the words they had memorized, but they didn’tnecessarily understand what they were saying. Some tomes were in languages noone could understand.”“We understood enough.” Victoria picked up the story with an edge in her voice.“But we did recognize we needed help. The canyon dwellers occasionally tradedwith the towns in the great valley, although we were considered primitive andstrange. The wizard wars were long over, and as far as we could tell, the OldWorld was at peace.“So, when the camouflage shroud came down, we decided to bring in experts fromoutside. The best and most studious scholars from the valley, those who showedan aptitude for the gift. We were cautious. We invited only the exceptionalones, and then we guided them here through the maze of canyons, up from thevalley and into the plateau.”“All told, this archive now supports a hundred dedicated scholars,” Simoninterrupted her. “I was one of those who came here long afterward, a giftedscholar—gifted in both senses of the word—summoned when I was young and eager,so that I could devote my life to relearning all the lost knowledge. I was quiteskilled at reading and interpreting, and I learned many languages. I was sotalented, in fact, that I rose to prominence here.” His smile of wonder turnedinto a troubled frown. “I came twenty years ago, just after the Lifedrinkerescaped.”Victoria’s mood darkened, too. “For years now we have had no more new scholars.The towns in the valley are gone, swallowed by the growing Scar.” Her voicebecame bleak. “We are all that remains. The Lifedrinker’s devastation has notreached us yet, but it is only a matter of time, a few years at most.”Simon nodded somberly. “Our main work in the archive is simply to understandwhat we have. So much knowledge, but in such disarray! Even after half acentury, two-thirds of the books remain to be organized and cataloged.”“All of my memmers recall separate pieces,” Victoria said. “We have tried toexchange information so that we can at least refer one another. It is a vastpuzzle.”Simon’s voice took on a sarcastic edge. “Yes, and what the memmers say theyremember cannot always be verified with printed documentation.” He picked up ahoneyed orange slice and sucked on it. “Thankfully, we can study all of thescrolls and tomes, and specialized memmers are no longer necessary. Entire teamsof scholars have been reading tome after tome, studying and translating in orderto relearn all that knowledge … and make use of it. We will become great wizardssomeday, but it takes time. We are all self-taught, and some of us have agreater gift than others. We are searching to find a spell powerful enough tofight the Lifedrinker.” He swallowed hard and looked away. “If we dared to doso.”“Self-taught wizards?” Nicci was skeptical. “The Sisters of the Light spentyears training gifted young men to use their Han, to understand their gift, andnow you are attempting to train yourselves? Using old and possibly mistranslatedbooks?”Nathan’s brows drew together in a show of his own concern. “I’m afraid I alsohave to worry that the memmers must have garbled some lines, misrememberedcertain words from generation to generation. Such trivial errors might notamount to anything of significance in a legend or a story, but in a powerfulspell the consequences could be dire.”While Victoria took quick offense, and Simon mumbled excuses, Nicci suddenlyrecalled the damaged, half-melted tower in the Cliffwall alcove, and she drewher own conclusions. “You have already made mistakes, haven’t you? Dangerousones.”Simon and Victoria both looked embarrassed. The scholar-archivist admitted,“There was a certain … mishap. One of our ambitious students had an accident, anexperiment went wrong, and the main library vault holding our prophecy books wasforever damaged. We lost much.” He swallowed hard. “We don’t go there anymore.The walls are collapsed and hardened over.”“The memmers still recall some of those volumes that were lost,” Victoria said.“We will do our best to reproduce them.”Nathan exchanged an expression of concern with Nicci, then spoke to thescholars. “I suggest you exercise a great deal of caution. Some things are toodangerous to be dabbled with. Your one ‘accident’ destroyed a building or two.What if another error causes even greater harm?”Simon looked away as he stood up from the table. “I’m afraid you are correct.Another one of our scholars already made such a grave mistake and turned himselfinto the Lifedrinker. Now the whole world may have to bear the consequences.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 42 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch42]After the meal, Simon led the companions deeper into Cliffwall through the backof the stone-block buildings and into the warren of excavated tunnels thatpenetrated the vast plateau. The wide halls were lit with so many magicallyburning lamps that Nicci hoped this was the extent of their dabbling. Smalllight spells were one thing, but unleashing larger, uncontrolled magic was farmore dangerous.The main fortress buildings that filled the cave grotto were enormous, but thearchive vaults were even more impressive. The spacious, vaulted chambers hadwalls lined with shelves crammed with books. In room after room, students sat inreading chairs or hunched over tables next to the bright glow of oil lamps. Binsfilled with scrolls stood at the end of each long table. Ladders extended to thehighest shelves to make hard-to-reach volumes more accessible. An intensity hungin the air, a hush as so many people devoted their full energies to relearningknowledge lost to history.“Places like this were called central sites,” Nathan said, “large caches ofbooks hidden under graveyards, in the catacombs beneath the Palace of theProphets, or in ancient Caska.” He looked around, curious. “This appears to bemore extensive than anything I have previously seen.”“And you are only seeing the smallest fraction here,” Simon answered. “Remember,these archives have only been open for fifty years, and the wealth ofinformation is daunting, tens of thousands of precious volumes.” He spread hishands. “Even after decades, we are still trying to catalog what knowledge wehave. That is the first important step. We don’t even know what’s here.”Victoria added, “When the ancient wizards compiled this archive, they were in arush and under threat of extermination. They desperately needed to preserve asmuch knowledge as possible before Sulachan could destroy it. Caravans bearingmagical tomes and scrolls came into the hidden canyons to unload, and ridersarrived overland with packs of stolen books, half-scorched manuscripts rescuedfrom libraries and universities that were burned by the emperor’s hunters. Astime ran out, books of all kinds were piled up and sealed away with littleattempt at organization.”Victoria brushed a stray wisp of gray-brown hair from her forehead. “The memmerswere assigned volumes by level of importance, rather than specific categories.Therefore, certain memmers might know about weather magic and prophecy, alongwith dire warnings about Subtractive Magic. Another memmer might preserveknowledge of how to manipulate earth, clay, and stone, as well as how to controllightning, and maybe change the currents in the sea, although we are far fromthe ocean.”“That is quite a jumble,” Nathan said. “How does one locate any specificknowledge?”Simon shrugged. “By searching. That is the life of a scholar. All knowledge isuseful.”Nicci’s response was harsher. “Some knowledge is more useful than others. Rightnow we need to know about the Lifedrinker. The Scar continues to grow, and hemust be stopped.”Simon wore a troubled expression. “Let me tell you—or better yet, I’ll show you,so you can understand.”He led them through passageways like wormholes, deeper into the heart of thehuge plateau, and eventually up a winding slope until they reached the oppositeside of the mesa. A natural rock window opened out from the cliffs of theplateau’s sheer drop-off, which spilled down to hills and the sprawling valley.They stood together at the opening and looked out upon the sickening extent ofthe Scar, far away.It was late afternoon, and the sun set in a glowering red blur at the horizon.Nicci could see the spreading desolation that rippled outward from a distantcentral point. “All of this used to be beautiful,” Simon explained with a sigh.“A green, bucolic paradise. Until the Lifedrinker destroyed it.”Nicci frowned, more determined than ever. “Before we can fight him, we need toknow who the Lifedrinker is, where he gets his power. Where did he come from?”Simon sighed. “He was one of Cliffwall’s most ambitious scholars. His name wasRoland.”Bannon stared out at the desolation. “One of your own people did that?”“Not intentionally,” Victoria said, as if defending the man. “It was anaccident. I was a scholar, married, in my middle years. Roland had been studyingthe archives for a long time. He was one of the first outsiders invited in afterI brought down the camouflage shroud.”“Roland was revered among us,” Simon interjected with a sigh. “I wanted to belike him—everyone did. He was Cliffwall’s first scholar-archivist. But even thegreatest scholars suffer human frailties.” He shook his head. “Roland was not anold man, but he fell ill with a wasting disease, a terrible sickness thatweakened him, made him grow gaunt. Tumors grew inside him like snakes. And thesickness was beyond the skill of our best healers.”Victoria picked up the story. “Roland lived his life in terrible pain,weakening, and he knew he would die before long. We could all see it. His eyeswere hollow, his cheeks sunken, his hands trembled. He had such a great mind,and we were all dismayed that we would lose him. There seemed to be nothing wecould do.“But Roland did not accept his weakness. He did not surrender. He was afraid todie, in fact, and he vowed to save himself, at any cost. Roland said he had toomuch work to do here.” Victoria swallowed hard.“He asked questions, trying to find someone with the knowledge that he sought.He studied scrolls and books, searching desperately for what he needed in orderto draw energy that would let him fight the wasting disease. So, he found aspell, a dangerous spell that would allow him to absorb life energy and keephimself alive. One of my memmers recalled it, at least partially, and that gavehim a clue for his search of the uncataloged archives. He knew it was unwise,but he told no one. Knowing he would die soon, he worked the life-energy spellwithout hesitation, even though he didn’t really understand what he was doing.He bound it to himself so that he could borrow bits of life from the world andrejuvenate his ailing body.”Victoria pressed her lips together until all the color drained out of them. “Andit worked. Roland had been so weak and skeletal, clearly on the edge of death …but he grew strong again. The spell worked wonders. It brought back the flush ofhealth. I remember seeing him.” Her expression grew more troubled. “But thenRoland didn’t know how to stop. He couldn’t control it.”Simon cut her off. “I recall those days of growing fear—I had just come here asa student. Roland felt guilty, horrified at what was happening to him—and atwhat he was doing to others. He kept draining more and more of the life aroundhim, whether or not he wanted to. We tried to help him. His friends rushed tohis side, offering their assistance, promising that they would help him solvethe problem—but anyone who touched him died. Roland stole their lives andincorporated them into his own. We all began to weaken.”“He killed my husband,” Victoria said. “To protect us, to save us, Roland fledCliffwall. Unable to control the magic he himself had unleashed, he ran far fromthe archives and out into the valley wilderness, away from the towns … althoughnot far enough. He hoped to live out his days there and harm no one else. Butthe Lifedrinker spell continued, unstoppable, never satisfied. Roland was like asponge, absorbing life from the forest, from the grasslands. His very existencekilled trees, drained rivers dry. And the desolation around where he had gone toground spread wider and wider in an ever-expanding scar. He wiped out croplands.He erased entire towns.” She straightened and brushed a hand across her eyes.“Roland didn’t mean it.”Nicci thought of Thistle’s family, of Verdun Springs, how they had clung totheir hardscrabble existence, and then died. “His intentions don’t matter. Thinkof all the damage that man has done. He must be stopped, otherwise hisbottomless pit of magic will swallow the world.”Simon added, “For years our Cliffwall scholars have been scouring the books,trying any mitigation spell they could find. But no one could even get close towhat was needed.”As the night deepened out in the dead valley, Nathan stared out at the Scar,watching the shadows move. “I wouldn’t expect you to know how to stop such apowerful enemy. All of you are untrained wizards. You have read books, but youwere never trained by a wizard, and you have never proved your abilities. Ah, Iwish the Prelate Verna were here to help you. Wizardry untested cannot betrusted.”“You tried your best,” Nicci said. “Now we will do our own research. If thisarchive is as vast as you say, it must hold the key, a counterspell. We simplyneed to find it.”“We would do anything to help you save us,” Simon said. “But after the …accidents, we are afraid to try extreme measures of our own.”“That is wise,” Nathan said. “But something must be done.”“That’s why we are here,” Nicci said, then finally admitted, “to save theworld.”The orphan girl added with deep longing in her voice, “I want to see the valleythe way it’s supposed to be. I want to see the fertile land, the green fields,the tall forests.”Nicci looked at Thistle. “You will.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 43 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch43]Though Nicci wanted to begin her research in how to combat the Lifedrinker, sheknew they were all exhausted from their long journey. Deep night had set inoutside.“Let us show you to your rooms,” Victoria said. “You must rest.” She glanceddown at Thistle. “The girl needs her sleep.”“I’m still awake. I’ll help.” She looked at Nicci, determined. “And tomorrow Ican study alongside you.”“Are you able to read?” Nicci asked.“I know my letters, and I can read a lot of words. I will be much better afteryou teach me. I learn fast.”Nathan gave a good-natured chuckle. “Dear girl, I appreciate someone so willingto learn, but that is quite an ambitious goal. Some of these languages andalphabets are unknown even to me.”Nicci fixed her gaze on Thistle’s dust-smeared skin, her bright and intelligenteyes. “When the Sisters trained me in the Palace of the Prophets, I spent morethan forty-five years as an acolyte learning the basics.”The girl looked amazed. “I don’t want to wait forty-five years!”“No one does, but you’re an intelligent girl. Since you learn quickly, it mighttake only forty years.” Thistle did not at first realize Nicci was teasing her.Then Nicci continued in a more serious tone, “We need to defeat the Lifedrinkerlong before that, or there won’t be any world left.”Victoria shooed them along. “Rest now, time for a fresh start tomorrow. We haveseparate quarters for each of you. They are austere, but spacious. We will letyou unpack and rest.”“Not much to unpack, since we lost almost everything when the dust peopleattacked,” Bannon said. “We’ve been living with little more than the clothes onour backs.”With a warm smile, Victoria promised, “We will provide clean clothing from theCliffwall stores, and we will launder and mend your own garments.”The matronly woman showed them to private chambers deep within the plateau,where the temperature was cool and the air dry. Beeswax candles burned insidesmall hollows in the stone walls, adding a warm yellow glow and a faint sweetscent. Each room’s furnishings consisted of a reading desk, an open floor with asheepskin to cover the stone, a chamber pot, an urn of water, a washbasin, and anarrow pallet for sleeping. In each room, fresh, loose scholars’ clothes hadbeen laid out for them.Victoria offered the spunky orphan girl a place of her own, but Thistle followedNicci into her chamber. She bounced up and down on the pallet’s straw-filledbedding. “This is soft, but it may be prickly. I’d rather sleep on the floor.You can have the pallet. That sheepskin looks warm enough for me. I’ll stayclose if you need me.”Even though the girl seemed perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, Nicciasked, “Why don’t you want your own room? You can sleep as long as you like.”Thistle blinked her honey-brown eyes at Nicci. “I should stay nearby. What ifyou need protection?”“I do not need protection. I am a sorceress.”But the girl sat cross-legged on the sheepskin and responded with a bright grin.“It never hurts to have an extra set of eyes. I will keep you safe.”Although she would not admit it, Thistle obviously did not wish to be alone.“Very well, you can guard me if you like,” Nicci said, remembering all the girlhad been through. “But if you are to be effective in protecting me, I’ll needyou rested as well.”After they had changed into the borrowed clothes, one of the Cliffwall stewardsarrived at their door to gather the bundled-up garments to be laundered andmended. The waifish girl’s rags needed a great deal of repair, as did Nicci’sblack traveling dress. After handing over the old clothes, Nicci sorted throughthe scanty possessions she had managed to save from Verdun Springs.Eager to help, Thistle laid out the items on the writing desk—the long sharpknife, some rope, near-empty packets of food. Although exhausted, the young girlkept up a chatter. “I never had any brothers and sisters. Do you have a family?”Her elfin face was filled with questions. “Did you ever have a daughter of yourown?”Nicci arranged the bedding on her pallet, keeping her face turned away so thatshe could ponder the proper answer. A daughter of her own? Someone, perhaps,like Thistle? The idea had not occurred to her, not for a long time at least.She touched her lower lip, where she had once worn a gold ring.“No, I never had a daughter.” It should have been a simple answer, and Nicci waspuzzled as to why she had hesitated. “That was never meant to be part of mylife.”After all those times Jagang had sentenced her to serve as a whore, or when hehimself had forced himself upon her, Nicci surely had the opportunity to becomepregnant, but thanks to her skills as a sorceress, she had never needed to worryabout a child. She had always prevented herself from conceiving. Early on, Niccihad learned how not to feel anything—no passion, no love of any kind.The girl examined the items Nicci had removed from the pockets of her old traveldress, her belt, and her side pouch. She unrolled a cloth-wrapped packet amongthe paraphernalia. “Oh, a flower!” Thistle said, looking at theviolet-and-crimson petals. “You carried a flower all this way?”Nicci instantly swept up the cloth packet, whisking the dried blossom away fromthe startled girl. “Don’t touch that!” Her pulse raced.Thistle flinched. “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do anything wrong. I…” Shecleared her throat. “It must be very special to you. Is it a pretty keeepsakefrom a suitor?”Nicci narrowed her blue eyes, amused by the idea. Bannon had indeed offered theflower as a romantic gesture—a notion she had thoroughly quashed. “No, not thatat all. The deathrise flower is deadly poison—one of the most potent toxins everfound, very dangerous.” She wrapped it carefully in the cloth again, then placedit in the highest alcove above her sleeping pallet. “It would lead to a long andhorrible death. Maybe the most horrible death ever known.”Thistle looked relieved. “So you’re protecting me! And I’ll be safe, too.Because we protect each other.” The girl rearranged the sheepskin on the emptyspace on the stone floor, ready to curl up and go to sleep.Nicci blew out one of the candles, but before she could extinguish the other,Thistle asked, “If that poison is so deadly, couldn’t you use it to kill theLifedrinker?”“No, I don’t think it is potent enough for that.”Thistle nodded, then wrapped the sheepskin around her and lay down on the hardstone floor, which she insisted was perfectly comfortable. “Then we’ll have tofind a different way.”Nicci used magic to snuff out the candle on the opposite wall, plunging the roominto darkness.* * *Though he was anxious to study Cliffwall’s wondrous books and scrolls, Nathanslept for many hours that first night. He felt safe, warm, and comfortable forthe first time in a long while.After waking refreshed, he hurried to the dining hall, where he scrounged a fewscraps of breakfast, since most of the scholars had eaten much earlier andhurried to work. His borrowed scholar’s robe was comfortable, though a bit draband not at all fashionable. He supposed it would do until his more acceptableclothes came back from the washing and mending teams. For now, he would scourthe library in hopes of finding how to stop the Lifedrinker’s voracious,out-of-control spell that sucked away all life.In the first of the library chambers, he considered a wall of fat leather-boundvolumes. So many of them! Scrolls lay unfurled on tables as intent scholarsdiscussed the possible meanings of obscure lines; other readers hunched overopen tomes, writing notes with chalk on flat slates.When he looked at the dizzying number of shelved books in front of him and theother walls with an equal number of shelves—and knowing there were numerousrooms identical to this—the scope of Cliffwall’s knowledge felt as intimidatingas it was exhilarating.In the Palace of the Prophets, books had been Nathan’s quiet companions for athousand years, his source of information about the outside world. Recently,Richard Rahl had also granted him access to all of the books in the People’sPalace of D’Hara, but most of those works had dealt with prophecy, and so wereno longer relevant. Now the world’s future might depend on what he read here.And there was so much more than the witch woman’s cryptic line in his life book.Being surrounded by these works made him feel as if he had come home again—evenif it was a huge home and a cluttered mess. “Dear spirits, how can I find anyinformation here, except by accident?” He paced in front of the shelves,pondering, while acolyte archivists rolled scrolls or replaced volumes in theirproper spots.Victoria approached him, accompanied by her three lovely acolytes. “My memmersand I are here to be of assistance, Wizard Nathan. Simon’s catalog system isconfusing to most, and he is the only one who knows where the volumes are. But Ihave committed many of these works to memory, and my lovely acolytes each holdmore than a hundred volumes in their own minds. I can also bring you Gloria,Franklin, Peretta, and ten more well-trained memmers. You could sit back whilewe recite our knowledge to you.”Nathan found it amazing that these young women—or any of the memmers—were ableto commit thousands of pages of dense and precise magical lore to memory, evenif they did not organize or, perhaps, understand the words they could recite.Audrey, Laurel, and Sage looked at him with such intensity that he felt a warmflush come to his cheeks. He gave Victoria a polite, gentlemanly smile. “I amimpressed with your skill, madam, and I would certainly welcome the company ofsuch beautiful ladies, but I’m afraid they would distract me. I’ve spent yearsreading books with my own eyes, and that’s the way I should search for theinformation.”Victoria’s grandmotherly face wrinkled with disappointment. “Generations ofmemmers have well-respected skills. We possess the information you need. If youtell us what you are searching for, we can quote the relevant passages for you,if we remember.” She waved a hand dismissively. “These books are just the staticpreservation of words. We would bring those words alive for you. We could tellyou everything we know.”The woman’s determination made him uncomfortable, and he wanted to get to workin his own way. “It doesn’t seem pragmatic, I’m afraid. I can’t study so muchmagical lore if it is locked inside your heads, and I don’t have the time tolisten to your people speak aloud one book at a time.” He traced his fingersalong curious symbols on the spine of one black volume. “Some of these tomes arewritten in languages I don’t recognize, but I am fluent in numerous others. Ican read quite quickly.”“But not all the books are available to you,” Victoria said. “You saw thearchive tower that melted in the … accident. All those books were wiped out.”“Your memmers can recall the volumes that were lost there?” Nathan asked.The three young acolytes nodded. Victoria lifted her chin with a measure ofpride. “Many of them. We don’t exactly know what was lost. For the most part,they were works of prophecy, but many were miscategorized.”Nathan let out a sigh of relief. “Prophecy? Well, then, with the star shift,prophecy is gone and any such volumes would contain little of practical value.Prophecy is of no use to us—and certainly of little interest in our quest tostop the Lifedrinker.”But he did not so easily dismiss the prediction Red had made. And the Sorceressmust save the world.Victoria could not hide her indignation at his attitude. “If that is what youtruly wish, we will leave you to your studies, then. My memmers are always hereto assist. We can recall many things that Simon and his scholars have not yetbothered to read.”Nathan gave the woman his sweetest smile. “I thank you. Everyone at Cliffwallhas been so generous. If the knowledge is locked away here, we will find it, andwe will use it to defeat the Lifedrinker.” He fought back a flush ofembarrassment, as he realized that his own unfortunate lack of magic would makehim of little use in the actual battle against the evil wizard. “Nicci is apowerful sorceress. Do not underestimate her. She used to be called Death’sMistress, and she struck fear across the land.”Victoria’s expression turned sour, unimpressed. She seemed a competitive sort.“Death’s Mistress? We have no need of further death. Let us hope she can bringlife back to our fertile valley.”The woman departed with her acolytes, leaving him alone to face the disorganizedbooks, scrolls, and tomes before him. He didn’t know where to begin his searchfor the original spell that had created the Lifedrinker, or where to find anappropriate counterspell.But he had other priorities as well. If Nathan could restore his own magic, hecould fight beside Nicci against the Lifedrinker. Somewhere in the library mustbe information about how and why he had lost his gift, or perhaps an accuratemap showing how to find Kol Adair. Everything was connected.He walked along the shelves from one side of the great chamber to the other,running his finger across the spines of the leather-bound volumes. He didn’tknow where to start.So he carried a volume at random over to a table and took a seat next to anintense young scholar who didn’t even look up from her reading. Nathan openedthe book and scanned the handwritten symbols on the page, not certain what hewas searching for, but sure he would uncover useful information, nevertheless."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 44 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch44]While Nathan assessed Cliffwall’s countless volumes of preserved magical lore,Nicci decided she needed firsthand knowledge about the Lifedrinker. While shewas an accomplished scholar in her own right, she wanted to investigate the Scarwith her own eyes.Bannon was also restless, wandering the silent halls of the giant archive. Hepracticed with his sword, prancing about in the open halls, because his mentorwas too preoccupied in the library. He would dance, slash, and twirl down thecorridors, frightening a few distractible scholars as he fought his own shadow,and usually defeated it.When Nicci proposed a cautious reconnoitering of the Scar to learn about theLifedrinker, Bannon jumped at the chance. He raised his sword. “I’ll go along,Sorceress. Sturdy and I will be your protectors.”Thistle was always at her side, and she sniffed at the young man’s eagerbravado. “I am Nicci’s protector.”“I need no protector, but you are welcome to come along, Bannon Farmer. Theremay be more dust people to fight.” She turned to the orphan girl. “But you willstay here, where it is safe.”“I don’t want to be safe. I am safest when I’m with you.”Nicci shook her head. “Bannon and I will go scout, and we’ll be back in a day ortwo. You stay here.” Disappointment flashed in the girl’s eyes, but she didn’targue further. She darted off to find Nathan and see if he needed her help.Nicci once again wore her black travel dress, which had been cleaned and mended.The people of Cliffwall provided packs, water, and food for their scoutingexpedition.Before she and Bannon set off into the broad desolation, Simon joined them atthe outer wall of the plateau, from which they would climb down into thefoothills. “Most of those who go to seek the Lifedrinker never come back,” hesaid.“We don’t intend to fight him now,” Nicci said. “We are just investigating,checking to see his defenses. And when I return, armed with the intelligencewe’ve gathered, I can help Nathan look for what we need among all thosevolumes.”She and Bannon left Cliffwall in the early morning, emerging from the oppositeside of the plateau onto a steep, winding path. They picked their way down thesheer slope to the foothills, where the vegetation had begun to wither as theLifedrinker’s desolation expanded. The low mesquite trees and piñon pines hadbent over, as if in the agony of a long poisonous death. Thorny weeds tore attheir clothes as they walked along, descending through the hills. Black beetlesscuttled along the ground, while spiders hung forlorn in empty webs.Much farther out into the valley, the terrain was cracked, lifeless desert.Nicci tried to imagine that broad expanse filled with croplands, thrivingvillages, and well-traveled roads, all of which had now been swallowed in thedust over the past twenty years. From the vantage of the foothills, the waves ofoncoming desolation were as apparent as ripples in a pond.She narrowed her eyes as she gazed toward the heart of the crater. “TheLifedrinker will be there. We’ll get as close as we can for now, gatherinformation, but I will save the real fight for when I know how to kill him.”Bannon squinted toward their destination, then gave a quick nod.Before they left the last hills, Nicci heard a rustling of shrubs behind her, aloose stone kicked aside, the crack of a dry mesquite branch. Bannon spun,raising his sword, and Nicci prepared to fight.When the dry boughs of a dead piñon moved aside, Thistle pushed herself through,looking around. Spotting Nicci, the girl smiled. “I knew I would catch up withyou sooner or later. I came to help.”“I told you to stay behind,” Nicci said.“Lots of people tell me things. I make up my own mind.”Nicci placed her hands on her hips. “You should not be out here. Go back toCliffwall.”“I’m coming with you.”“No, you are not.”Thistle clearly wasn’t going to listen. “I know these lands. I’ve lived here allmy life. I led you to Cliffwall, didn’t I? You would never have been able tofind it without me. I can take care of myself—and I can take care of you.” Sheput her hands on her rag skirt, imitating Nicci’s stance. Her lips quirked in adefiant smile. “And if I wanted to keep following you, how would you stop me?”Nicci gave a quick answer. “With sorcery.”The girl huffed. “You would never use sorcery against me.”Thistle’s bold confidence brought a wry smile to Nicci’s lips. “No, I probablywouldn’t. And I’m fully aware of how useful you can be out in the wild, perhapseven more so than Bannon.”The young man flushed. “But I’ve proved my usefulness in battle. Think of howmany dust people I killed back in Verdun Springs, and all the selka beforethat.”“And you may need to fight and kill more enemies.” Nicci didn’t want to wasteany more time. “Very well. We will go together, scout the Scar, and returnquickly. But stay alert. We don’t know what other defenses the Lifedrinker mighthave.”Descending from the last foothills, they headed along cracked canyons that ledinto the Scar. The breezes swept up white, salty dust from the dry ground, andBannon coughed as he wiped bitter white powder from his face. Nicci’s eyesstung. Her black dress was also smeared with tan and white from all the blowingalkaline powder. She rationed her water, knowing they would find none in thedesolation.The ruined landscape seemed to grow angrier as they continued. The sun poundeddown as they emerged from the widening washes of dry rivers that were now justbarren, rocky beds. Salt-encrusted boulders protruded from the ground, and allthat remained of round lakes were cracked mosaics of dry mud. Dust devilsswirled ghostly curls of powder.Weary in the oppressive environment, the three engaged in little conversation,and paused to rest infrequently. When they sipped a drink, their water tastedbad from the caustic dust on their lips.Farther along, the cracks in the ground exhaled fumes where steam rose up fromunderground vents. Nicci smelled the burnt tang of brimstone. Bubbling mud potslooked like raw wounds; bursting and splattering, they emitted the foul stenchof rotten eggs. Thistle sprang from rock to rock, picking out a safe path forthem.The stirred debris in the air made the sun appear swollen in the late afternoon,and Nicci felt uneasy about the prospect of camping in the Scar. “It’s beenhours since we last saw even a dead tree,” Bannon said.“We can find shelter in the rocks,” Nicci said. “Or maybe we should just walkthrough the night. I can make a hand light to guide us.”The girl looked uneasy. “Dangerous things come out at night.”Bannon looked around warily, but the sulfurous steam from fumaroles and bubblingmud pits made the air thick with haze. The sounds would have masked any stealthymovement.Nicci said, “We can be attacked just as readily during the day.”As they considered their choices, the dry, caked dirt stirred beneath them.Reacting quickly, Nicci pushed Thistle to safety and she herself sprang back asdark, desiccated hands reached out of the dust. Cracks spread apart in theground, and dust people crawled up from below. Bannon yelled and raised hissword, running toward the attackers.Nicci let magic boil into her hand. She had battled these things before. Shereleased a surge of fire, igniting the nearest attacker before it could crawlentirely out of the cracked soil.Jumping onto a flat rock for stability, Bannon swung his sword with a vicioussweep that decapitated three mummified men clad in dirt-encrusted rags. But evenheadless, the creatures still lunged forward, blindly grasping for victims.Dodging from rock to rock, Thistle ducked under the outstretched claws, andBannon cleaved a cadaver’s torso in two, then hacked off its brittle legs at theknees.Nicci released a focused hammer blow of wind that shattered the bones and driedsinews of another emerging creature, leaving it in a pile of broken debris halfout of the ground. Another push of air knocked the unsteady dust people backwardinto the bubbling mud pits. The creatures fell into the roiling, churningcauldrons, where they thrashed and sank.Thistle sprang onto the back of a desiccated creature that advanced toward Niccifrom behind. The girl tugged at its shoulders and battered her fists onto itssticklike ribs, stabbed the dry body repeatedly with her knife. The mummifiedcreature broke and fell to the dust.As Nicci turned to thank her, another pair of dust people crawled up out of theground, lunging toward Thistle with a clearly focused intent. One was ashriveled woman with a faded red head scarf wrapped around the tufts of wiryhair on her skull. The other, a man, wore the tattered remnants of a leathervest.Thistle lifted her knife to swing at the new attack, but then she froze inhorrified recognition. The dust people stumbled toward her, much too close,hooked hands grasping for the girl. “Aunt Luna? Uncle Marcus!”Nicci recognized them as well, and she swept in, placing herself in front of thestunned girl. The creatures that had been her aunt and uncle wanted to dragThistle back with them, but Nicci stood before them. “You can’t have her!”Leathery, cadaverous hands touched her arms, her black dress—and Nicci releaseda furious surge of magic, sparking fire within the inhuman remnants of Marcusand Luna.The sudden fire burned a hot, purifying white, consuming the remains of the twoin an instant. As they reeled away from Nicci, the pair fell into fine gray ash,dropping with a rushing sound that was almost a sigh. Thistle let out adespairing cry.Panting heavily, the three stood together, poised for more attackers, but theLifedrinker sent no more dust people after them. The battle was over as swiftlyas it had begun. In the distance, they heard scuttling movement, a clatter ofpebbles … not reanimated corpses this time, but other creatures—armored thingswith many legs that kept to the shadows.Thistle clung to Nicci’s waist. “The Lifedrinker knows where we are. He isspying on us.”“Are you sure we should keep going out there in the darkness?” Bannon asked. Hecould barely keep the quaver from his voice.“It would be a waste to sacrifice ourselves now,” Nicci said. “Until we discovera way to cut off the Lifedrinker’s magic, we have seen enough. For now.”They made good time retracing their steps toward the rising land at the northend of the vast dead valley, but it was long after dark when they reached thedying forests and remnants of trees in the foothills. The dry grass, dead weeds,and gnarled, leafless trees seemed welcoming by comparison. They were exhaustedby the time they found a place to camp.“At least we have enough wood to build a fire now,” Bannon said. “A very largefire.”Still shaken from seeing the remnants of her aunt and uncle, Thistle broughtseveral armloads of dry mesquite and made a pile at their chosen campsite.“It’ll be very bright and warm, but won’t the Lifedrinker be able to see such abig fire?”Nicci used her magic to ignite the pile, and the bright fire crackled withintense flames and ribbons of aromatic smoke. “He knows full well where we are.Now at least we will be able to see any attack that comes.”Bannon and Thistle hunkered close to the comforting flames. “Both of you sleep,”Nicci said. “I will keep watch.”They bedded down, though they remained restless for many hours. As she satalone, Nicci listened for sounds beyond the pop and crackle of the burning wood.The Scar remained silent, an emptiness in the dark that seemed to swallow upsound as well as life. Nicci sensed some other presence out there, however,something prowling in the dying hills around them. Alert, she peered into theblackness beyond the firelight, but could see nothing, hear nothing. Yet shefelt it … something strong and deadly.Something hunting them."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 45 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch45]Surrounded by gifted scholars, Nathan found their dedication refreshing andinspirational. “If I had a thousand years with this grand library, I’d becomethe greatest wizard who ever lived,” he said with a good-natured but wearysmile, as Simon brought him another stack of volumes.“A thousand years…” said the scholar-archivist with a shake of his head. Hearranged the selected volumes in careful stacks on Nathan’s cluttered studytable. “I would like nothing more than to spend centuries reading, studying, andlearning … but alas, I have only a normal life span.”“That was one of the few advantages of being trapped inside the Palace of theProphets, the webs and spell-forms that prevented us from aging,” Nathan said.He looked at the mountains of books brought to him for his review, stacked bysubject, some of the passages marked with colorful strings or feathers toseparate the pages. “But if the Scar continues to grow and grow, there may notbe more than a normal life span left for any of us.”Intent on searching for any useful information about the Lifedrinker, theCliffwall students pored through book after book, scroll after scroll,highlighting any writings that might bear relevance. Nathan wanted to find theoriginal spell Roland had used to fight his wasting disease, the spell that hadtransformed him into the Lifedrinker.During his years in the palace, Nathan had become an extremely fast reader. Eventhough he’d had all the time in the world, he also had access to thousands andthousands of books, and even forever hadn’t seemed like enough time. He couldskim a document as fast as he could turn the pages, and he could absorb severalthick volumes in an hour.In only two days here in Cliffwall, he had already finished reading shelves ofbooks, but it would take so much time to learn it all. So much time … He hadlearned very little about the Lifedrinker’s draining spell.Nathan drew his fingers down his chin. “Remind me, did you say that Roland useda spell that was preserved by the memmers?”“One of the memmers remembered part of it and made certain suggestions. Theygave Roland an idea where to look.” Simon frowned at an embossed leather volumeand set it aside. “We have not yet been able to recover the original text of thespell to study it ourselves. Therefore, we must rely on Victoria’s word.” Whenhe frowned, the lines in his face made him look much older. “Memories can befaulty. I would prefer independent text verification.”As if summoned, the memmer leader came up with her three lovely acolytes. As sheheard him speak, her face darkened with annoyance. Audrey, Laurel, and Sagecrowded close behind her, looking indignant on her behalf.“The memmers are beyond reproach.” Victoria stood before the study table piledhigh with tomes. “You wouldn’t have any of these books to study at all, were itnot for me. If I had not discovered how to dissipate the camouflage shroud, noone would have access to the archive.”“Nor would Roland,” Nathan pointed out, “and we wouldn’t be in quite so muchtrouble.”Simon gathered his dignity and drew himself taller in an attempt to belittleVictoria. “All of us in Cliffwall appreciate your past service. The memmers wereimportant in their day, but you are obsolete now. Gifted and intelligent peoplehave access to the entire library now, not just selected volumes memorizedgenerations ago.”Victoria huffed. “Words written on paper are different from words held in themind.” She tapped her temple and leaned close. “It matters not what is writtendown, but what we know.”Simon plainly disagreed. “Knowledge that is not written down cannot be properlyshared. How can I study what is inside your mind? How can our scholars drawinsights and conclusions if we can’t see your thoughts? How can you shareproperly with Wizard Nathan right now?”“We will tell him whatever he needs to know,” Victoria said.Nathan raised his hands I exasperation. “Dear spirits, do not quarrel! Cliffwallis a banquet of special lore, and we have a feast before us. Why quibble over afew tidbits?”Struggling not to let the argument flare, Simon turned to depart. “I will keepgathering suitable volumes for you and let these women tell you the stories theyhold in their heads.”Victoria gave the scholar-archivist a condescending frown as he left. “Don’tworry about young Simon, Wizard Nathan. He has reached a level of responsibilitybeyond his capabilities.” She sounded sweet and maternal. “Archiving all thevolumes in the library is an immense and overwhelming task, and it will takemany generations to do properly. Memmers have dealt with the problem ofretaining our information for thousands of years, so it is understandable whySimon feels such urgency.”“But there is genuine urgency, madam,” Nathan said. “If the Lifedrinkercontinues to drain the world, none of us has much time left.” He ran his fingersthrough his shoulder-length white hair. “I do need to know what you havememorized, but, as Simon pointed out, I cannot access what is stored inside yourhead.”Victoria smiled with a patient warmth. “Then we will lead you through it. Weshall recite the books you need to read, because we know them by heart.”Nathan could skim words on paper faster than any memmer could speak, but ifVictoria and her acolytes sorted through their memorized knowledge and recitedonly the relevant portions, perhaps it would be worthwhile.He regarded Audrey, Laurel, and Sage, saw the three different types of beauty.“They are not your actual daughters, though I see how you care for them. Youmust be very close.”“These dear girls have spent their lives with me. I consider all of my acolytesto be my surrogate sons and daughters.” Sadness washed over Victoria’s face likea fog closing in. “I never had children of my own, although my husband and Itried very hard. When we wed, Bertram and I dreamed of having a large family,but…” Her expression fell further, and she turned away. “But I was barren. Wenever had children. Three times I found myself pregnant, and we had such hope. Ieven started making infant clothes … but I lost the baby each time. And thenBertram died.”She closed her eyes and heaved a great breath. She gave the three young acolytesa loving look. “So I poured all my maternal instincts into guiding my acolytes,and over the years I have trained a family larger than Bertram and I everdreamed we could have.“I have done my duty to preserve the memmers, so that knowledge is passed onfrom parent to child, independent from what is written down in the archive.” Shesounded defensive. “I refuse to let go of our heritage. It is we who kept thelore preserved for the centuries when Cliffwall remained hidden.” Audrey,Laurel, and Sage, with tears in their eyes, nodded. Victoria swept the three ofthem into a hug. “Sometimes I wish I had never remembered the spell thatdissolved the camouflage shroud.” She shook her head.“You had to,” Laurel said.“It was time,” Sage said.Intrigued, Nathan pushed the stacked books aside. “And how exactly did youreveal the hidden barrier after thousands of years? I thought no one knew how tocounter the camouflage spell.”“It was a rare mistake—for the memmers, and for me.”Nathan folded his hands together, raised his eyebrows. “I am listening.”“As we told you, the camouflage shroud was more than just a disguise. It was abarrier, a preservation spell. Cliffwall was sealed behind a barricade of time.Not just hidden—it was gone.“But the first memmers were given the knowledge of how to take down that secretbarricade when it was time. If no one remembered how to drop the shroud, thenthe knowledge might as well have been destroyed. So, the key was passed along inour collective memory, generation to generation.” She nodded to herself. “Afterthree thousand years had passed, and the wizard wars were long over, the canyondwellers considered it safe enough to try. But, alas, the release spell we hadmemorized millennia ago no longer worked.”Victoria put a hand to the center of her chest and drew a shaky breath.“Somewhere along the line, we had remembered it wrong! We truly could not recallthe nuances of phrasing. At some point when passing the knowledge from parent tochild, from teacher to student, someone must have made an error.” She lookedaway in embarrassment, as if the revelation shamed all memmers.“Dear spirits,” Nathan muttered.Victoria continued, “We could admit it to no one, though. The isolated canyonpeople had devoted their lives to keeping the secret—for millennia! They trustedthe memmers, they believed in us. We could not tell them we had forgotten! Somestalled for time, making awkward excuses and saying that it wasn’t yet time toreveal the archive. But no one knew how to do so! For more than a century, weheld out hope that someone would figure out what had gone wrong. The memmerssecretly prayed that someone would correct the spell and reveal the libraryvaults again.”Victoria looked up, met Nathan’s azure gaze. “That person was me … and it was amistake. I memorized a spell incorrectly. I uttered an improper combination ofsyllables in the ancient tongue of Ildakar.” She continued in a breathy voice,“And it worked! I was just a girl of seventeen years, being trained by myparents … and I got the spell wrong.”Nathan let out a delighted chuckle. “But, dear madam, you accidentally got itright. You made a corresponding error, mistakenly saying the sounds properly.The camouflage shroud fell, and you revealed the hidden archive. That is exactlywhat you wanted, isn’t it?”“Yes.” Victoria sounded disappointed. “For millennia, the memmers were powerfuland respected, the keepers of inaccessible knowledge. But by throwing open thefloodgates and inviting gifted scholars from the outer towns, I may have made usobsolete.”“Perhaps.” Nathan briskly rubbed his hands together. “But now everyone has thisknowledge. It may help us defeat the Lifedrinker.”Victoria’s face remained lined with concern. “Dangerous information for any foolto use! Giving it to people who were not ready, not trained—that was whatcreated the Lifedrinker in the first place.”She grumbled. “My mother was a harsh teacher. She would make me repeat her wordsover and over again until each spell became part of my soul, every wordimprinted in the marrow of my bones. She beat me with a willow switch every timeI made an error. She would shriek warnings at me about the dangers a mistakecould unleash on the world.”Victoria lifted her shoulders and let them fall. “I remember my father’s smileand his patience, but my mother did not believe he took his role seriouslyenough. She blamed him for teaching me an incorrect phrase, and he just laughed,delighted that the problem of the shroud had been solved—by his own daughter. Itwas time for celebration, he said. The camouflage shroud was at last gone.”Victoria leaned closer to Nathan, who was captivated by the story. “My motherkilled him for it. She threw him over the cliff before he could believe what shewas doing. My mother didn’t even bother to watch him fall. I heard himscream—and it stopped when he struck the ground.“My mother railed at me for making my mistake. ‘Do you not know how importantthis is? Do you not see that every word must be perfect? If you do not reverethe words, the dangers could be unimaginable!’ I was terrified. All I could hearwere shouts down on the canyon floor as people rushed to my father’s body. Butmy mother was intent on me. Her eyes were wild, and I could feel her hot breathon my face. ‘I killed your father to protect us all. What if he had misquoted afire spell? What if he mistakenly taught one of us how to breach the veil andunleash the Keeper upon the world?’ I had to nod and admit the depth of myfather’s error. We never mourned him.” Tears filled Victoria’s eyes.“But if your error corrected an error, why should you feel guilty?” Nathanasked.“Because the error itself showed everyone that our perfect memory might not beperfect.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 46 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch46]At their makeshift camp, the hot mesquite campfire died to orange coals beforedawn, but Nicci did not wake Bannon to change the watch. She needed littlesleep, so she remained alert throughout the night, studying the nightmarishoutlines of rock formations at the edge of the waning firelight. As soon asThistle awoke, the girl crawled over to sit next to her. Neither of them said aword, but both stared into the darkness waiting for sunrise.Bannon yawned, stretched, and got to his feet, brushing dirt and dried twigsfrom his clothes. Soon enough, they set off, leaving the comforting glow oftheir campfire embers behind.As they made their way back toward the sheer wall of the plateau that rose upabove the encroaching Scar, Nicci and Bannon picked their way along a wash,while Thistle scuttled ahead with the grace and agility of a darting lizard.They found a trickle of water and followed it up step after step of ocherslickrock. The trickling sounded like music after the dust devils and chemicalhaze of the desolation. The three spent long moments cupping their hands,filling their palms with drip after drip of cold water, which they splashed ontheir faces to wipe away the burning alkaline dust.“Can the Lifedrinker still be watching us?” Thistle asked. “Even here?”“He could be. There are other dangers, as well,” Nicci said. “Something in thisworld always wants to kill you. Don’t forget that.”They moved on up the canyon. Reptiles darted among the rocks overhead, andThistle glanced up at the ledges, tempted to hunt them, but she kept movinginstead.Bannon trudged through the rocks of the wash, keeping his sword in hand just incase. All night long, Nicci had sensed that predatory presence circling theircamp, but she had heard no sound, seen no flashing eyes in the firelight. Nowshe again felt that oppressive sense of being watched. Following Bannon, shelooked around, stared at the rock formations, and wondered if the evil wizardmight stage another ambush. But she saw nothing.Silent and unexpected, something heavy dropped from above and struck her in theback, an avalanche of tawny fur, slashing claws, and loud snarls. The blowknocked Nicci to the ground before she had a chance to release her magic.Bannon yelled and spun around. Thistle cried out.Hidden in the ruddy tan of the slickrock walls, two additional feline shapessprang—huge sand-colored panthers with curved saberlike fangs and claws, like afistful of sharp daggers.When the first panther crashed down on Nicci, the blow knocked the wind out ofher. She squirmed, trying to fight back. The beast was a dynamo of muscles, itsbody an engine of attack. It could kill her in mere seconds.Nicci dodged the first swipe of its paw, but the other paw raked bloody furrowsdown her back, slicing open her black dress. The panther let out a roaring yowland tried to clamp its fangs down on her head. Nicci didn’t have time or luxuryof concentration to find its heart with her magic and stop it dead.In a desperate defense, she released an unfocused wave of magic, a ripplingshock wave of compressed air in every direction. The invisible explosion flungthe feline attacker away from her, but the blast seemed oddly diminished.Bleeding badly, Nicci staggered to her feet.Bannon had pressed his back against the slickrock wall for protection while hejabbed with his sword. One of his blows scored a bloody gash in the ribs of thesecond panther. Thistle dodged and darted as the third beast tried to trap her,playing with her like a cat with a mouse. Angry at seeing the girl threatened,Nicci reached out and aimed her gift, intending to burst the heart of theattacking panther.Nothing happened.Nicci felt the flow of magic go out of her, but somehow her spell bounced offthe sand panther like a stone skimming over the surface of a pond. She triedagain, also with no effect. She had control of her gift—she had not lost it,like Nathan—but this big panther was impervious to her strike.As the beast prowled in, Nicci saw that its hide was branded with arcanedesigns, glyphs that were all angles and swooping curves. She recognized it as aspell-form of some sort, perhaps a kind of magical armor.These were not merely wild beasts.Nicci crouched to defend herself as the first panther came back to attack. Shehurled fire that should have incinerated the big cat, but the magical flamesrolled off of its fur. Undaunted, the snarling cat sprang toward her, and Niccihad no time to consider what alternative magic might be effective.She pulled the long dagger at her side, ready to fight. She realized the brandedarcane symbols might give the sand panthers a kind of protection against magic,but surely a sharp knife would cause damage. She sliced the air with her dagger,then sprang to one side as the lunging cat missed her. She did not have time forfinesse, nor did she mean to taunt these creatures. She needed them dead.Thistle ducked behind a fallen slab of slickrock and a twisted piñon. Bannondefended himself, wildly flailing with his sword, forgetting the intricate movesthat Nathan had taught him. The panther was also a flurry of feral rage.Nicci watched the big cats move together in an oddly coordinated attack. Thethree big cats moved in eerie unison. They had separated their prey, and eachpanther seemed to know what the other two were doing. Although she couldn’t readthe symbols branded on their hides, she had heard of spell-bonded animalsbefore. These three panthers were a fighting triad, a troka, their mindsconnected to one another to make them a perfect fighting force.Nicci wondered if the Lifedrinker had sent these predators to attack them, butthat didn’t seem right. Sand panthers were not part of the Scar, or the originalfertile valley here from years ago. They must have been raised and trainedsomewhere else, by someone else.Regardless of their origin, the cats were perfect killing machines. The reasonsdidn’t matter. Not now.She diverted her attention to see Thistle duck under the piñon boughs andscramble out the other side as the cat lunged into the tangled branches. Thegirl rolled on her back and came up with her own knife in her hands. She wrappedboth hands around the hilt as the panther pounced.Nicci caught her breath, knowing that she couldn’t reach the girl in time—andthen she realized that Thistle had intentionally lured the overeager predator.As the cat lunged, Thistle brought the knife up under its chin, driving theblade through its jaws, the roof of its mouth, and into its brain. The pantherconvulsed and shook, then collapsed on top of the scrawny girl, nearly crushingher.When the big cat fell dead, the other two panthers shuddered and reeled, as ifthey, too, had suffered a painful blow. They howled in eerie unison.Bannon used that moment to charge forward, thrusting his sword straight into therib cage of the second panther. The tawny predator thrashed and roared, openingits mouth wide, but the sword point had pierced the creature’s heart andprotruded from the opposite side of its chest.Nicci raked her own knife across the ribs of the last panther, which wasmomentarily stunned by the deaths of its two spell-bonded partners. The maddenedcreature slashed at her with its claws, and Nicci sliced again with her knife.The injured beast thrashed its tail and came back in a wild attack, as if readyto throw away its life. The heavy creature drove her to the ground, but Niccistabbed upward, deep into its belly.Soaked with blood, Thistle squirmed out from under the body of the panther shehad killed and flew like a demon to Nicci’s rescue. The girl stabbed the lastpanther several times with her own knife, and with a great heave, Nicci pushedthe dying beast away. She extricated herself and stood covered in blood, boththe panther’s and her own. The skin of her back had been torn to ribbons.Bannon was in shock as he slid his sword from the carcass of the panther he hadkilled. “I’m surprised the Lifedrinker didn’t send giant scorpions orcentipedes.”Nicci shook her head as she stood bleeding, beginning to feel the fiery pain ofher multiple wounds. “I am not certain the Lifedrinker is the cause of this.”The last sand panther was not dead. It lay on the ground heaving great breaths,rumbling with deep pain and bleeding from numerous wounds.Bannon stepped up behind her, gasping at the deep bloody furrows in her back.“Sorceress! Those wounds! We have to heal them.”Nicci looked down at her scratched arms. “I can heal myself.” She bent next tothe dying sand panther. “But this one is nearing its end. I should put it out ofits misery.” She looked around. “With those spell symbols shielding it frommagical attacks, I’ll have to use my knife.”The dying panther emitted a loud rumble that sounded more forlorn thanthreatening. Bannon’s face fell and his lip trembled. “Do you have to kill it?Can’t you heal it, too?”Nicci narrowed her eyes. “Why would I tend this creature? It tried to kill us.”“What if it was trained to do that? Shouldn’t we know where it came from?”Bannon asked. “We already killed the other two, and it’s…” The words caught inhis throat and he choked out the rest. “It’s such a beautiful cat.…” He couldn’tsay any more.As the adrenaline rush faded, Nicci began to feel the raging pain of her ownwounds. This panther’s claws had torn her back down to the muscle and bone. “Itis not a helpless kitten like the ones your father drowned.”“No it’s not.” Bannon shook his head. “But it is dying, and you can heal it.”Thistle squatted next to the heaving panther and looked up at Nicci with herhoney-brown eyes. “My uncle and aunt said that you shouldn’t kill unless it isabsolutely necessary.” Smeared with blood, she looked waifish and forlorn.Bannon agreed. “And this isn’t necessary. Not now. “Nicci reached out to touch the heaving female cat, cautiously extending hermagic to measure the extent of its injuries. The branded spell symbols did notstop her, so she realized the protection must be specifically designed todeflect an attack. She moved her hand to touch the knife wounds she hadinflicted. “I can heal it. I can heal her,” Nicci said, “but you need to knowthat these three sand panthers were spell-bonded. Her two sister panthers in thetroka are dead. If we save her to live entirely alone, we may be doing this oneno favors.”“Yes we are,” Thistle insisted. “Please, Nicci.”Her own wounds and blood loss were making her dizzy, making her weak. She didn’thave the strength to argue with the orphan girl.Nicci touched the panther’s deep cuts. As she did so, some of the animal’s bloodmingled with her own from the gashes in her arms and hands. The blood of twofierce creatures trained and ready to fight …Nicci called up her healing magic, released a flow through her hand into thetawny beast, while also infusing her deepest wounds.When she did so, Nicci felt a sudden jolt, like the last link being forged in amysterious chain that connected her with the panther. The chain, the bond ranfrom her heart through her nervous system and her mind, and extended into eachof the cat’s counterpart systems. Thoughts flooded through her as powerfulhealing magic surged into both of them, erasing the claw wounds, the knife cuts,the scrapes, the smallest scratches, even the sore muscles.Yanking her bloody hands away, Nicci staggered backward. Even when she stoppedtouching the panther, she could sense the animal’s presence connected to her.Like a sister. She could not deny it.“Her name is Mrra,” Nicci said in a hushed tone. “I don’t know what the wordmeans. It’s not really a name, just her self-identity.”The newly healed panther huffed a great breath and rolled over, coiling backonto her feet. The cat’s eyes were golden green. The long tail lashed back andforth, in agitation and confusion.“What just happened?” Bannon asked. “What did you do?”“My blood mingled with hers. The death of her spell-bonded sisters left a voidlike a wound inside her. When my magic healed Mrra, it filled that void withinme at the same time.” Nicci’s voice grew breathy, and she was amazed at what sheherself had experienced. “Now we are connected, but still independent. Dearspirits!”The sand panther looked up at her, thick tail thrashing. Nicci looked again atthe scarred spell symbols, but in spite of her link to Mrra, she still could notinterpret the language. She did, however, understand the residue of pain—thelumpy, waxy scars from when red-hot irons had brutally branded those symbolsinto the soft tan fur.Staring at her former prey, Mrra twitched, then dropped her gaze to the bodiesof her two sister panthers. With a low growling moan, she turned to pad away,putting distance between herself and the three humans that the troka had meantto kill.Nicci could feel the bond between them stretching, thinning. She couldn’tcommunicate directly, couldn’t understand what Mrra might be thinking. She justknew that she, Bannon, and Thistle were safe from further attack. And that Mrrawould live now … if alone.But not completely alone: there would always be a shadow of Nicci inside her.With a thrash of her tail, the sand panther loped into the desolate wilderness,bounding up into the slickrock outcroppings, ledge by ledge.Thistle stared after the sand panther, while Bannon still held his bloody sword,confused. As Nicci watched the panther go, she felt a strange sense of loss.In a flash, the beast vanished into the uneven shadows."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 47 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch47]As he began to grasp the sheer breadth of the library, Nathan believed theCliffwall archive might hold the secrets of the entire universe … if only hecould figure out what he needed and where to find it. He pondered as he nibbledon an oat biscuit that one of the acolytes had brought him from the kitchens.The problem was, no one understood the entire puzzle. Altogether, the hundredsof archivists and memmers knew only disconnected pieces. It was like trying tofind the constellations on a cloudy night when only a few flickers of starsshone through.Well, the constellations were all wrong now anyway, and everyone had to relearnthe universe from scratch.Nathan finished his biscuit and absently munched on another from the plate. Hefinished skimming the volume in front of him just as a shy young female scholardelivered more. Mia was one of the students assigned to assist him. Aboutnineteen years old, she had short mouse-brown hair and darting eyes that seemedmore accustomed to reading than making contact with other people.“I found these for you, Wizard Nathan. They might contain viable lines ofinvestigation.” She was a daughter of a canyon-dwelling family, and she hadgrown up learning to read and study. She had been born just after Roland fledCliffwall and began to drain the life out of the world.“Thank you, Mia,” he said with an appreciative smile. Whenever he asked her tofind books or scrolls on a particular subject, she would hurry off and returnwith possibilities. As he ran his fingers down the words in ancient languages,Mia would often sit quietly beside him, reading books that had captured her owninterest, hoping to help.Now he picked up the top volume and opened the scuffed cover. “Ah, a treatise onenhancing plant growth.”Mia nodded. “I thought it might offer some possible counteraction to theLifedrinker’s magic that drains life. The foundational spell-forms might havesome commonalities.”“Excellent suggestion,” Nathan said, although he thought it unlikely.The next volume in the stack was covered in letters he did not recognize, angledsymbols and swooping curves of runes. The words seemed to exude a kind of power,and he touched the writing as if he could let the foreign alphabet seep into hisfingertips. “Do you recognize this language?” he asked Mia. “It is not HighD’Haran, nor any of the languages of the Old World that I know.”The young woman pushed her short hair back from her face and tucked it behindher ears. “Some of our oldest scrolls are written in those letters, but no onecan read them anymore. Some say they were part of an ancient library stolen fromthe city of Ildakar.”Nathan set the volume aside, since the incomprehensible writing rendered ituseless to him. He was delighted to see that the next book contained maps of abroad land area, although without any frame of reference. One chart showed arange of mountains extending from rolling foothills to sharp crags. Dotted linesindicated winding, treacherous paths that led up to a summit. The exotic namesof peaks and rivers were unfamiliar—until his eyes fixed on a pair of words.Kol Adair.He caught his breath. So, his destination truly existed—in that much, at least,the witch woman had been right. He wondered if the broad valley on the maprepresented the once-fertile basin that had become the Scar.Nathan felt a desperate longing to have his magic back, if only to help in thefight against the Lifedrinker. Nicci couldn’t be required to save the world onher own. Upon beginning this journey, he had not cared overmuch about losing hisgift of prophecy, since all the forked paths and dire warnings had caused himnothing but grief. But his gift of magic was such an integral part of him thathe had taken it for granted. It made him whole.He tapped on the map, but his own needs would come later. He set aside thevolume and pondered the Lifedrinker’s spreading desolation. Nathan went back tohis books, still searching for the answer.* * *Nicci, Bannon, and Thistle reached the sheer rock wall below the mesa, glad toleave the bleak Scar behind. Thistle climbed up the steep slope, easily findinghalf-hidden trail markers and ledges on the way to the alcove opening high abovethat led back into the plateau and the archive city.As she climbed, Nicci looked back the way they had come. The powdery dustwhipped across the desolate crater like a miasma. When Bannon stopped beside herat the entry alcove high up on the plateau wall, they all stood together lookingout at the devastation. The Lifedrinker was somewhere deep at the center of thecrater.“Are you anxious to go back there, Sorceress?” he asked.“No,” she answered honestly, “but I know we must.”Nicci could still feel a tendril in her mind of a prowling feline presence—alonely presence. Mrra was out there, roaming the uninhabited wilderness. Thespell-bonded cat had spent her life as part of a troka with two sister panthers,both now gone. The healing magic had filled that void with Nicci, but she didn’tknow how to help.…When they returned to the Cliffwall gathering chambers, Nathan hurried out tojoin them, glad to see them back safe. Hearing about their battles with dustpeople and sand panthers, he gave Bannon’s shoulder a paternal pat. “Did you usethe swordcraft I taught you?”Bannon nodded. “Yes, I remembered everything you showed me.”Nicci remembered how wildly the young man had flailed with his blade, but he hadfought the enemies, as needed. She couldn’t fault Bannon for that.“I killed as many as he did,” Thistle boasted.“Of course you did, child,” Nathan replied with a wry smile. “And that isexactly what we expect of you. But Bannon is my protégé, and I wanted to makesure he acquitted himself well. As you did.”“Even though you weren’t supposed to come along,” Nicci said, though herreprimand had no sting. “I’m glad you know how to take care of yourself.”The girl looked up at her. “Am I your protégée, Nicci?”The idea surprised her. This orphan girl was certainly useful, and eager tohelp, but Thistle hadn’t shown any particular aptitude for the gift. “A protégéein what way? I cannot train you to be a sorceress.”“But my reading is better now. I can help you find books in the library. Yousaid you needed to do a lot of research.”Nicci was surprised to realize she wasn’t averse to the idea. “You can help, solong as you don’t get in the way.”“I won’t!”When the scholars gathered, Nicci gave a more detailed report of the desolation,the cracked canyons, the fumaroles and mud pots, as well as the Lifedrinker’sdefenders. She sketched out a map, as best she could remember. “I am sure therewill be more powerful guardians closer to the evil wizard’s lair. We must beready.” She raised an eyebrow at Nathan and all the eager scholars. “As soon asyou find me a weapon I can use to kill him.”Simon lifted his chin. “I am confident the answer resides here in the archives.”His fellow scholars gave intent nods and muttered among themselves. “We justhave to find the right records.”In the dining hall, they all sat down as servers brought in the evening meal.Thistle ate with her hands—both hands, since she was voraciously hungry.Victoria led her student memmers into the room, taking them to Nathan so theycould describe some of the subjects they had committed to memory.The three beautiful acolytes sat next to Bannon, leaning close and listening tohis every word. Audrey, Laurel, and Sage found excuses to feed him morsels offood from his plate: roasted vegetables, freshly baked rolls, skewers of spicedlamb. Warming to his tale, the young man talked with exaggerated gestures. Sagepicked up a cloth napkin and dabbed the side of his mouth. His cheeks turnedpink.Audrey giggled. “Look how his freckles stand out when he blushes!”The comment only made him turn brighter red. “I appreciate your attentions. Idon’t often have such a … beautiful audience.” He swallowed hard, then gulpedfrom a goblet of spring water, muttering, “Sweet Sea Mother!”Victoria stepped up behind Bannon and gave the acolytes an encouraging smile. “Iunderstand your attraction to the young man,” she said, as if Bannon weren’tthere. “I hope you three don’t turn out to be barren and childless, as I am.”Bannon blinked. “I—I don’t want to stay here and marry anyone.” He looked atNicci as if hoping that she would save him. “We’re on a mission.”Nicci regarded him coolly. “After I saved you from the cutthroats in Tanimura, Itold you to rescue yourself from then on. You will have to meet this challengeon your own.”Bannon blushed again.Victoria sounded sad as she stood like a mother hen behind the three youngwomen. “Dry, dusty scrolls cannot possibly make up for carrying a life insideyou, or holding a newborn baby. Someday you’ll know.”The three acolytes smiled.Victoria stepped over to Thistle, who was finishing a second handful of grapes.The girl still wore her dusty, raggedy clothes from the journey out into theScar. “I have good news for you, child.” She set a cloth-wrapped parcel onto thetable and began to undo the knotted twine that held the edges together. “We havevery few young children here in Cliffwall, and certainly no suitable clothes, sotherefore I asked a skilled seamstress to make this new for you.”She held up the garment, shaking the fabric to unfold a small, trim dress madeto fit Thistle’s scrawny form. It had been dyed bright pink.Thistle stopped chewing a mouthful of grapes. “A new dress?” She frowneduncertainly, not sure how to react. “I’ve never had a dress like that before.”Victoria continued to smile. “You no longer need to wear rags. You are such apretty girl, and this will make you even prettier. Do you like the pink? Itcomes from cliff roses that grow in the canyons.”The dainty dress seemed unsuited for the girl’s life of running through thedesert and hunting lizards. Thistle looked at Nicci, who responded with a hardhonesty. “In general, I dislike the color pink.” So much so, in fact, that Niccihad once used Subtractive Magic in a wildly inappropriate fashion just to erasethe pink dye from a satiny nightdress she had been made to wear in the Wizard’sKeep.“I think I like my old dress better,” Thistle said. “This one is very nice, butI wouldn’t want it to get dirty when I follow Nicci on her explorations. We’vegot the whole world to see after we kill the Lifedrinker.”Victoria chuckled. “But, child, you’re with us now, here at Cliffwall. You willstay and be one of my acolyes. I will teach you how to read and understand thespells, and soon enough you will be able to memorize hundreds of books. You willbecome our newest memmer.” She patted the girl’s arm.Nicci felt on edge. “But is that what the girl wants?” Thistle looked back andforth from the matronly memmer woman to the sorceress.“Of course it is,” Victoria said. “I will take you under my wing, child, cleanyou up, and train you.”Thistle squirmed on her bench. “I want to read better, and I want to learnthings, but I won’t just stay in Cliffwall. Nicci can teach me while we’re outexploring the world. For Lord Rahl. It’s an important mission.”Victoria gave a dismissive gesture. “Flights of fancy, child. Better to readadventures than have them for yourself. I can protect you.” She gripped thegirl’s bony shoulders, squeezing hard.Thistle ducked and slid closer to Nicci, leaving the pink dress on the table.Nicci rose to her feet, on her guard. “Enough, Victoria. The girl is with us.”The memmer woman looked angry, as if unaccustomed to anyone defying her wishes.She made a clucking sound with her tongue. “You know the child needs care and aneducation. We’ll train her how to remember.”Nicci’s voice was as hard as forged steel. “Thistle must make her own choice.Her life is her own to control.”“I want to hunt lizards and climb the canyon walls,” she interjected. “Niccipromised to take me across the Old World.”Nicci assessed the increased level of tension in the room. The scholars hadstopped eating, listening to the escalating verbal battle.Victoria fixed her gaze on the sorceress. “Are you the girl’s mother? By whatright do you make decisions for her?”“No, I am not the girl’s mother. I was never meant to be a mother. That was achoice I made.”Victoria’s mood shifted in an unexpected direction. “And have you ever thoughtit might be the wrong choice? Why would a beautiful, strong, and obviouslyfertile woman like yourself choose not to create life? I wanted so badly to havechildren but wasn’t able to!” Her voice rose as she grew more incensed. “No onehas ever denied me an acolyte before. Who are you to deny me?”Nicci thought of many answers, but chose the one with the most power. “I amDeath’s Mistress.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 48 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch48]After the satisfying meal in the warm banquet hall, Bannon could still taste thesweetness of the honeyed fruit from dessert. He patted his belly on his way backto his quarters. After sleeping outside in the dying foothills the previousnight, he found the simple stone-walled room with its sleeping palletwonderfully safe and homey. It reminded him of his own room back on Chiriya,when he’d been a young man, when he and his best friend Ian had talked abouttheir dreams … before his father had started beating him, before the Norukaislavers took Ian, before the world fell apart.Bannon closed his eyes and blocked those thoughts. He cleared his mind, breathedin and out, and repainted his memories with bright, if false, colors. Ready fora good night’s sleep, he dropped the fabric door curtain for privacy and removedhis homespun shirt, which was still encrusted with harsh white powder and driedsand-panther blood. Humming to himself, he tossed the shirt to the side of theroom; tomorrow, he would take it to the Cliffwall laundry. In the meantime, hehad a spare shirt and trousers, neatly folded on the unused writing desk.Someone had delivered a fresh basin of water for him, along with a soft rag hecould use as a washcloth. It was the sort of thing his mother would have done totake care of him. He dipped the rag in the water and used it to scrub his face.It felt refreshing and wonderful. Someone had even put herbs in the wash waterto make his skin tingle. He soaked the rag in the basin again, rinsing out thegrit and grime. He squeezed out the excess water, then looked up, startled asthe hanging cloth moved aside from the door.Audrey slipped in, her dark brown eyes glittering. She did not knock or ask toenter. Shirtless, Bannon was instantly embarrassed. He dropped the rag back intothe basin. “I’m sorry—” he said, then wondered what he was apologizing for. “Iwas just washing up.”“I’ve come to help you,” Audrey said with a smile and let the cloth hanging fallback into place.As she moved toward him, her deep brunette hair was long, loose, and lush.Unlike the white woolen gown she usually wore, her dress seemed tighter thanusual, its bodice cinched at her narrow waist and below her breasts to emphasizetheir swell. “After all you’ve been through, Bannon Farmer, you shouldn’t haveto wash yourself.”“I—I’m fine.” He felt his cheeks grow warm again. “I’ve been washing myself allmy life. It’s not … usually a job that requires more than one person.”“Maybe you don’t require it,” Audrey said, taking the wet rag and dipping itinto the herbed water, “but why turn down help? This is a much more pleasurableway to bathe.”All arguments vanished from his mind, and he realized he had no worthwhileobjections anyway.Audrey drew the moist cloth across his chest to wipe away the grit. She movedmore slowly than necessary, but her intention was not merely to clean him. Shewet the rag again and used it to caress his chest, then down along his flatstomach.Bannon realized his throat had gone entirely dry. He bent away in furtherawkwardness as he realized that he had become aroused, prominently pressing outfrom his canvas trousers.Audrey discovered it as well. She pressed her hand against his trousers, and alow groan came out of his throat without him even realizing it. He quicklytouched her wrist. “There’s no need—”“I insist. I want to make sure you’re thoroughly bathed.” She undid the rope athis waist to loosen his pants, which had become remarkably tight.Bannon squirmed. “Please, I—” He stopped and swallowed again. If anything, histhroat had become drier. He wasn’t sure whether he was asking her to pleasestop, or please continue. Audrey reached into his loose pants and used thewashcloth to stroke him with its moist softness.“I want you completely clean,” she said, then pushed him back to the pallet, butBannon’s knees were weak and he was ready to collapse anyway. As he lay therelooking up at her with shining eyes, Audrey loosened the laces of her bodice,removed it, then slipped out of her white shift, letting the soft wool slideaway from her creamy shoulders to expose her ample breasts. The dark circles ofher nipples reminded him of the berries she had fed him at the banquet table notlong before.He gasped with wonder at the sight, and she turned to him let him admire thecurve of her back, the gentle swell of her perfect buttocks. But Audrey wasn’tgoing away from him. She just wanted to snuff one of the candles, leaving only asingle orange flame flickering in its pot. It was enough light for them to see,but most of the time Bannon had his eyes closed. He gasped many more times asshe joined him on the pallet, pressing him down on his back. She slid one legover his waist and straddled him.When returning to his quarters, Bannon had been exhausted and sleepy, but nowsleep was the farthest thing from his mind.He touched Audrey’s skin, felt its warmth, then reached up as she leanedforward, inviting him to cup her breasts. When she shifted her hips to settle ontop of him and he slid inside her, he felt as if he had fallen into the embraceof paradise. And it was.Bannon lost all sense of time, hypnotized by the sensations that Audrey showedhim. And when she was done and climbed off of him, she leaned forward to kisshim long and full on the lips, then trailed her lips down his cheek, and hisneck. He let out a long, shuddering sigh of ecstasy. He was even more exhaustednow and not at all tired. His entire world had changed.As Audrey picked up the supple white shift and pulled it over her head, hisheart already ached for her. “I … I don’t know what to say.”She giggled. “At least you knew what to do.”“Does this mean that you—you’ve chosen me? I’m sure I’d be a good husband. Ididn’t know that I wanted to get married, but you’ve made me—”She laughed again. “Don’t be silly. You can’t marry all of us.”“All?” he asked, not understanding.After Audrey finished dressing, she came back to his pallet, where he laydrifting and happy, his entire body tingling. She kissed him again. “Thank you,”she said, then slipped out of his chambers, darting silently into the corridors.Bannon’s head was spinning. He was sure he would have a foolish grin on his facefor days, if not months. He closed his eyes, let out a long sigh, and tried tosleep, but his body was still on fire. He had heard many love poems before,minstrels singing about the yearning of romance, and had not quite understoodit. Of course, Bannon remembered his foolish attraction for Nicci, his ineptflirtation in giving her the deathrise flower, but he had never dreamed ofanything like Audrey. Perfect, beautiful, and hungry Audrey.He lay for an hour, wanting to sleep, but not wanting to let go of a singlemoment of these cherished memories. He relived in his mind her every touch,imagining the feel of her lips on his cheek, on his mouth, on hischest—everywhere.He heard a rustle of the fabric door hanging and didn’t at first understand whatit was, until he raised his head, blinking. Had Audrey come back?Laurel stood just inside the doorway, her strawberry-blond hair brushed andshining in the faint light of the remaining candle, adorned with a singledecorative braid. She responded with a seductive smile, and her green eyessparkled. Her tongue flicked around the corner of her mouth, and she showedperfect white teeth.“I see you’re still awake.” She glided closer to his sleeping pallet as Bannonstruggled to sit up. “I hope I’m not disturbing you.” As Laurel moved towardhim, her hands worked at the tie at her waist, and she slid out of her acolyte’sgown like a beautiful naked butterfly emerging from a chrysalis.Bannon drew in a quick breath. He was alarmed, confused—and aroused again.“Audrey was just—” he said, reaching up, but instead of being pushed away, shemet him, took his left hand, and placed it against her breast. It was smallerand firmer than Audrey’s. Her nipples were erect.“Audrey has already had her turn,” Laurel said with a smile. “I hope you’re nottoo tired.” She reached down, ran her fingers along his belly, then farther downto stroke the corn silk there. She grinned with delight. “I see you’re not tiredat all.” She started kissing him, and now that Bannon knew exactly what to do,he responded with increasing enthusiasm. Given his earlier practice, Bannondecided he might be getting good at this after all.Laurel was slower and gentler than Audrey, but more intense. She caressed himand showed him how to caress her, wanting to enjoy his entire body, and Bannonproved to be an avid student again. When he tried to rush, feeling the passionbuild within him, she held him back, strung him along, teased him. Then sherolled him over, slid beneath him on the narrow pallet, drew him down on top ofher, and wrapped her arms around his back.She whispered hotly in his ear, “It’s all right. There’s no hurry. Sage won’t behere until closer to dawn.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 49 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch49]After seeing the desolation of the Scar firsthand, Nicci immersed herself in thelore in the wizards’ archive, devoting every hour to the piles of old books. Andalthough Thistle tried to help in every way, fetching books she thought lookedinteresting, bringing food from the kitchens, she was bored.The girl wished she could offer some assistance, but her skills as a scholarwere minimal. When she had helped her friends survive in the wilderness, she’dfelt important, useful to be catching lizards, finding water. But, books …Thistle didn’t know enough about magical lore or ancient languages.Her aunt and uncle had taught her letters, so she knew how to read some basicwords. She took it upon herself to memorize certain key terms that Nicci wasinterested in—“life,” “energy,” “Han,” “diminish,” “drain”—and she would standin front of the shelves in the great reading rooms, going from spine to spine,book after book, scroll after scroll. Each time she found a likely prospect, shewould hurry with it over to Nicci, adding it to the sorceress’s reading stack.Nicci always took her offerings seriously, but so far no one had found anyrevelation about the Lifedrinker’s possible weaknesses.Thistle had always been independent, able to take care of herself. She sensedthat Nicci valued her in part because the sorceress appreciated someone whocould handle her own problems. Thistle wanted to prove that she could be avaluable member of their group, but she felt left out, without a purpose toserve.So, she explored the great stone buildings and the tunnels that ran through theheart of the plateau like the worm tracks in a rotting tree. Absorbed in theirresearch, the Cliffwall scholars paid little attention to Thistle.She avoided Victoria, not wanting to be indoctrinated as a memmer to memorizeold books. Once, she came upon one of their rote-memorization sessions, withyoung men and women sitting cross-legged on the stone floor while Victoria reada paragraph aloud and then had them all repeat it word for word. Spotting her,the matronly woman gestured for Thistle to join them, but she ducked away. Theolder woman’s intensity made her uneasy. She didn’t want to be locked up hereporing over dusty old books all her life. She wanted to stay with Nicci instead.She wanted to share in her adventures.Thistle found a restless Bannon prowling the tunnels as well, carrying hissword. He commiserated with her. “I wish we could just do something.” He swunghis sword at invisible opponents, though there was little room in the passagewayfor a satisfying imaginary battle.“We should go out and fight the evil wizard together,” Thistle said.“You’re just a girl.”Thistle scowled. “And you’re just a boy.”Bannon huffed. “I’m a man, and I’m a swordfighter. You should have seen how manyselka I killed when they attacked the Wavewalker.”“You saw me fight the sand panthers,” Thistle said, “and the dust people.”With a sigh, he rested his sword on the stone floor of the tunnel. “Neither ofus poses much of a threat to the Lifedrinker. We have to wait until someonelearns how to destroy him.”Thistle frowned. “The waiting is driving me crazy.”Bannon went off down the tunnel battling imaginary foes with his sword, but whenhe came upon Victoria’s three beautiful acolytes, he awkwardly stumbled to ahalt. As opponents, Audrey, Laurel, and Sage could have hamstrung him with aflirtatious glance. Thistle rolled her eyes.She made her way through the tunnels to the window on the outer steep slope ofthe plateau. As she gazed out on the Scar, Thistle’s heart ached to see thesweeping devastation and the distant heat shimmer. She longed to know what thisbeautiful valley must have looked like at one time.The scholar-archivist Simon found her standing there. “I stare out at it everyday,” he said. “Each morning I watch the Lifedrinker expand his terrain and suckmore and more life out of the world. If you’ve been here as long as I, you knowjust how much we’ve lost.”Thistle looked up at him. “What was it like?”Simon gestured out the opening. “From here, you could see lakes and rivers. Thehills were thick with forests, and the sky was blue, not this dusty gray. Therewere roads from one end of the valley to the other, connecting the villages.Pastures and crops dotted the countryside.” He blew a soft whistle through histeeth. “Sometimes it seems I’m just remembering a dream. But I know it wastrue.”Thistle felt a tingle of warmth and determination. “We can make it that wayagain. I know we can.”Simon’s voice took on a harder edge. “It should never have happened in the firstplace—one of our scholars unleashing a spell he couldn’t control. Now the valleyis gone, the towns dried up—including my old home. The people are all dead.” Alow groan came out of his throat. “And it’s our fault. We have to find some wayto fix it.”“I want to help,” Thistle said. “There must be something I could do.”He gave her a patronizing smile. “I’m afraid this is a problem best left to thescholars.”Stung, Thistle turned away, muttering a quiet vow that she would help make theworld right again. Even after she left, the scholar-archivist continued to stareout at the far-off wasteland.* * *Forgoing sleep, Nicci read the words of tome after tome until her eyes ached andher skull throbbed from trying to take in so much information. Although shelearned a great deal, including many derivations of spells she had used in thepast, she did not find the answers she sought. She set aside another volume inimpatient disgust.Now she had a greater grasp of just how dangerous, how devastating theLifedrinker was, and if she did not stop him, then the world was indeed atstake—she did not underestimate the threat. The Scar would grow and grow,eventually drowning the Old World, then D’Hara.Now she knew full well why she was here.During the day, sunshine streamed in through the lensed windows of the toweringstone buildings to illuminate the document rooms. During the night she read bythe warm yellow light of candles or oil lamps. Nicci turned pages, studied thecryptic ancient languages, and dismissed ten more volumes by morning.Absorbed in his own research, Nathan could skim and grasp the contents withease, and he had always been more studious than Nicci. She was a woman ofaction, trying to save the world. She had in fact saved the world by helpingRichard Rahl, and saving the world from the Lifedrinker’s debilitating spell wasexactly what she needed to do next.Her eyes burned, and her neck and shoulders ached. Needing to clear her head andbreathe the open air, Nicci left the archive rooms and emerged from the higheststone tower in the sheltered cave grotto. She looked across the narrow innercanyon, thinking of the people who had lived there undisturbed for centuries.Although it was midmorning, the sun had not yet risen high enough to remove thedark cloak of shadows in the narrow canyons.She saw sheep grazing near the central stream flanked by blossoming trees in thenut orchards. Nicci inhaled, enjoyed the cool bite of the morning air. A faintbreeze blew stray wisps of blond hair around her face.Nathan stepped out into the open to join her. “Out for a breath of fresh air,Sorceress? Ah, when you look out at the sheltered settlement here, you canalmost forget the Scar and the Lifedrinker on the other side of the plateau.”“I can’t forget.” She glanced over at him. “I need to consider what we shoulddo. I found many tangential spells, but nothing good enough. This morning I’vebeen studying how one might kill a succubus, on the off chance it might proveuseful.”Nathan stroked his hands over his white hair. “How does a succubus relate to theLifedrinker?”“Both of them drain life. A succubus is a kind of witch woman who has the powerto absorb vitality through sex. Men find her irresistible, and she tempts themwith physical pleasure, trapping them as she drains them to nothing more than ahusk.” Nicci added with skeptical sarcasm, “The men supposedly die with smileson their lips, even as their faces shrivel away.”Nathan laughed uneasily. “It would not be wise for a woman as beautiful asyourself to have such magic, Sorceress.”Nicci lifted her chin. “I already have more powerful magic than that. It is alla matter of control—and I do have control. The Lifedrinker, however, does not.He drains the vitality of his victim, and in this case his victim is the wholeworld. In that sense, he is like a succubus.”“Quite extraordinary. And how is a succubus killed, then? What did the olddocument say?”“The succubus is responsible for her own demise … in a way,” Nicci said. “Ineach of the countless times she lies with a man, there is a very small chanceshe will get pregnant. If that happens, the succubus is doomed. The childitself, always a daughter, is a powerful entity that gestates and grows, untilit absorbs the life from its own succubus mother—doing the same thing to her asshe does to men, draining the mother dry until she is nothing but a husk. Thenthe baby claws its way out of her womb … to become the next deadly succubus.”Nathan pursed his lips. “That does not sound like a practical method of killinga succubus if we were to encounter one. There is no other way?”“According to the legend, the newborn succubus is weak. If one times an attackproperly, the baby can be killed, thus terminating the line of succubi.”Nathan looked across the quiet, narrow canyon at a shepherd guiding his smallflock to a flower-strewn patch of grass. “Although that tale is delightful andfascinating, I fail to see how it can be useful in our situation.”“I don’t see how it can help either.” She sighed.Victoria emerged from the tower library with a determined look on her face.Seeing them, she hurried forward. “In our communal discussions, my memmersrecalled something important.” She focused on Nathan. For the past two days,since Nicci had refused to let her take Thistle as a new acolyte, the matronlywoman had given her a cold shoulder. “Because each of us remembers differentbooks, the memmers compared notes, made suggestions.”“And you have remembered something useful?” Nicci asked. “That would be awelcome change.”Victoria’s eyes flashed with annoyance, and the wizard quickly broke in, “Whatis it? The original Lifedrinker’s spell?”Victoria rocked back, lifting her chin. “It is a story about the originalprimeval forest that once covered the Old World, the pristine wilderness thatthrived in perfect harmony with nature. The Eldertree was the first tree in thefirst forest—a towering and titanic oak that was the most powerful living thingin the entire world. It is a story of creation.”Nicci did not try to hide her disappointment. “How does an ancient myth about atree help us against the Lifedrinker? He is a present threat, not an old fable.”Victoria’s expression darkened. “Because all strands of life are connected,Sorceress. When the primeval forest covered the land, the world had great powerand great magic.” She addressed her story to Nathan, finding him a morereceptive audience. “Even before the wizard wars three thousand years ago,devastating armies swept across the Old World, cutting down trees, razing thelast remnants of the original forests. Those evil men cut down the originalEldertree, a task so difficult that it required a hundred powerful wizards andeven more laborers. And when the great tree fell, a vital part of the worlddied.“But one acorn was saved, one last seed from the Eldertree. As the armies cutdown the sweeping forests, they drove all the energy of life back into theEldertree until at last it was condensed into this single acorn, the final sparkof the primeval forest. All the energy of the Eldertree and all its offspringconcentrated into that single acorn, stored there, where it could someday bereleased in an explosion of incomprehensibly powerful life itself.”Nathan sucked in a quick breath of air. “And you think that might be powerfulenough to kill the Lifedrinker?”“It must be,” Victoria insisted. “But the more powerful he becomes, the moredifficult the task will be. Soon it will be too late. At the moment, I believethat Roland, or what is left of Roland, will be no match for the last spark ofthe Eldertree.”“Again, how does this help us?” Nicci said. “Do you believe the acorn trulyexists? If so, where can we find it? I have read many books and found no mentionof the legend or the seed itself.”Nathan also shook his head. “Nothing in my studies either.”“But I remember,” Victoria said. “It is in one of my memorized books. The acornof the Eldertree was locked away here in Cliffwall, deep in a vault … somewhereover there.” She indicated the misshapen tower that was partially melted into aglassy lump at the side of the alcove. “It is still here.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 50 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch50]Under Simon’s guidance, workers from the other canyon settlements brought theirtools to Cliffwall and set to work trying to reach the lower levels of thedamaged tower, hoping to find where the Eldertree acorn had been stored. In thecool, dusty underground, some of the access passages had slumped, the stonemelting like wax to clog shut the openings, but the determined laborers usedhammers and chisels to penetrate the hard slickrock.A solid wall of vitreous rock had flowed over the opening, sealing off an entirebasement level. Laborers were already hard at work, hammering and hauling awaythe rubble of broken rock. A grime-streaked stonecutter groaned and turned toSimon. “It’ll take many days to carve even a small hole through that, sir.”After they followed the workers down into the deep underground passages, duckingand crawling into the damaged vaults, Nathan looked at Nicci. “Sorceress, surelya barricade of solid stone is not too great a challenge for you?”“No, it is not. Allow me—we are in a hurry.” The workers backed away, curious,and Nicci reached out to touch the smooth wall of melted rock. When she releasedher magic, the stone that had flowed once, now flowed again. She did not need toresort to Subtractive Magic, but was able to work the material like clay, notdestroying the rock but simply moving it. She lifted handfuls of fluid stonelike a ditch digger slogging through mud. Although she expended a great effort,Nicci succeeded in carving out a tunnel, widening it, lifting the ceiling, andburrowing farther ahead.After using her magic to move aside ten feet of stone blockage, Nicci began todoubt there truly was another chamber on the other side of the rock. What if theclumsy and untrained wizard had solidified the entire archive with hisdisastrous accident? Soon, though, she felt the stone grow thin in front of her,then break like an eggshell, and she pushed her way into a dark, claustrophobicvault, exactly where the plans suggested they look. Inside, the air was thickand stale, sealed away for years.Cupping her hand, Nicci ignited a light spell so she could see the walls dottedwith cubbyholes carved into the slickrock. She shone the diffuse glow around thechamber, seeing shadows dance around reverent display shelves that were filledwith valuable, mysterious objects, artifacts, sculptures, amulets, all of themcovered with dust.Nathan pushed in behind her, and he straightened, fastidiously brushing stonedust from his borrowed scholar robes. “Dear spirits, this is exactly what wewere looking for. Is the Eldertree acorn here?”Simon and Victoria followed him, and they stared in amazement. “Exactly where mymemmers said it would be.” She flashed a sharp glance at Nicci. “You should havebelieved me, Sorceress.”“I prefer to have proof,” Nicci said, not responding to the other woman’s edgytone. “Now that I have proof, I believe you.”Impatient, they moved around the museum vault, inspecting the marvelous itemsthat had been sealed away for millennia. They searched among the exoticartifacts, carved vases and small marble figurines, bright glass vials, amuletsworked in gold and jewels, fired-clay medallions covered with a jade-greenglaze—and a wooden chest no wider than Nicci’s hand. She felt drawn to it,sensing an energy in the air, a power barely contained within the small box.When she removed it from the alcove, she felt a warm pulse through her palm.“This holds something very important.”“That is it,” Victoria said, pushing closer. “I remember the descriptions fromthe original writings.”Nicci opened the lid and looked at cushioned folds of purple velvet, whichembraced a single acorn that seemed to be made of gold.Nathan grinned like a young boy. “Quite extraordinary. The Lifedrinker will beno match for that. Now we have the weapon we need.”“Yes.” Nicci closed the small chest. “I do.”* * *Nicci was impatient to leave immediately. “The Lifedrinker’s power grows everyday. This mission will be more dangerous than our last expedition, but I willgo.” The scholars could study the other artifacts down in the vault in due time;if she defeated the evil wizard, they would have all the time in the world.Nicci removed the acorn from its ornate chest, wrapping it in the scraps ofpurple velvet so she could tuck it into the pocket of her black dress.As they returned to the main buildings of the archive, Nicci considered what shewould need to do before departure. Aside from packing food and water, she didn’tneed to make other preparations. Bannon and Thistle joined her, as curiousscholars gathered around, eager to see the Eldertree acorn.Victoria looked at Nicci, both stern and uneasy. Her brow furrowed as she spoketo the rest of the scholars. “I know she is the most powerful sorceress amongus, but I am reluctant to give such a sacred treasure—the essence of lifeitself—to a woman who calls herself Death’s Mistress.”Nicci continued her preparations, ignoring the memmer woman’s objection. “Itmust be done, and I am the one to do it.”With a sidelong glance at Victoria, Simon suggested, “Every person in Cliffwallknows that this is a great battle. We can send scholars and trainee wizards toaccompany you. We can be your army against the Lifedrinker.”Nicci looked at the too-young scholar-archivist. “You would all be slaughtered.None of you here is fully trained in magic. The risk is far too great.”Thistle ran up, excited. She had stars in her honey-brown eyes. “Nicci will doit, I know she will. Do you think it will restore the valley to the way it was?”“Killing the Lifedrinker will end the spreading blight,” she said. She did notwant to give the girl unrealistic hopes. “But the wound in the world is severe.It will take some time to recover, even after he is defeated.”“I need to go with you,” the girl insisted. “I have to help restore the valley.”Nicci would hear none of it. “Too dangerous. I cannot defend myself and finishmy mission if I’m worried about you.”“But you don’t need to worry. I want to go. I want to help—just like last time.”Nicci crossed her arms. “No, and you will not slip out to follow me. I may haveNathan tie your arms and legs and lock you in a room until I’m gone.”“You wouldn’t,” the girl said.“Correct, I wouldn’t—but only if you promise me you’ll stay behind. That is whatI need you to do, because it is the only way I can complete my mission. This isdeadly serious.”The girl fumed. “But—”Nicci raised a hand, leaving no room for doubt. “Or would you rather I blanketedyou with a sleep spell, so you do not awake for days?”“No,” the girl mumbled. “I promise I’ll stay here.” Her voice was low and glum.“And do you break your promises?”Thistle seemed insulted. “Never.”Nicci looked long and hard at her, and she believed the girl. “Then I will trustyou.”“That child must stay safe, of course,” Nathan agreed, “but in a great battlelike this, you need someone to fight beside you. The Lifedrinker is an evilwizard, perhaps one of the most powerful you have ever encountered.”“I have killed wizards before,” she said.“Indeed you have, but not a wizard like this. We cannot guess how theLifedrinker will try to block you. I should come with you, for whateverassistance I can provide.”Nicci raised her eyebrows. “How could you help? Your gift is gone.”He touched the hilt of his ornate sword. “I am an adventurer as well. Magicstill resides within me, whether or not I can use it. Maybe if I encounter theLifedrinker, it will help me to release my powers again.”A chill went through Nicci. “That is what I fear, Nathan Rahl. I know howformidable a wizard you can be, but we cannot risk it.”The old man huffed. “I insist—”She shook her head. “Think about it. When you tried to heal that victim in RendaBay, what did your magic do? The wild backlash tore him apart. And when youfought the Adjudicator, the magic backfired again, but fortunately for us, itfolded that man’s own evil magic back upon himself. But the Lifedrinker isalready out of control. If he encounters your wild, chaotic power and it twistsfurther, just imagine the possible consequences.” She watched his eyes widen asthe realization struck him. She continued, “When I unleash the Eldertree acorn,with so much magic surging through the air, blasting into the Earth—what happensif there is a backlash from your powers? The repercussions could tear youapart … or tear the world apart. We dare not risk it.”Nathan gave a reluctant nod and said in a small voice, “I fear you may be right,Sorceress. If I somehow twisted the Lifedrinker’s magic and turned it against usbut a thousand times worse, there would be no way I could place it back undercontrol. Dear spirits, the damage I could cause…”Nicci squared her shoulders, straightened her back. “I must depend on my ownmagic, and I can travel quickly.” She touched the folds of cloth that wrappedthe throbbing golden acorn in her pocket. “Your sword would be welcome, Nathan,but I already have my weapon.”Setting his jaw, Bannon stepped forward. “Then I am the one to go along. If youneed a sword, you can have mine.” He gave her a cocky grin, mostly for thebenefit of Audrey, Laurel, and Sage, who also stood listening. “And you alreadyadmitted that you never worry about me at all, Sorceress.”Nicci gave him a skeptical frown. “You should not make such a brash offer simplyto impress your lovers.”He turned as red as beet soup. “But, I can help! Sweet Sea Mother, you saw how Ifought the dust people and the sand panthers. If we are attacked as we approachthe Lifedrinker’s lair, what if I can buy you the seconds you need to completeyour mission? That might mean the difference between success and failure.”Nicci pressed her lips together, assessing the young man. In their battlesagainst seemingly insurmountable enemies, he had indeed killed more than hisshare of opponents. “I admit, you can sometimes be useful. But know that if yougo with me to fight the Lifedrinker, you could face certain death. I will not beable to save you.”“I accept those terms, Sorceress.” He swallowed hard, struggling to hide hisfear, since he clearly understood the risk in what he was suggesting. “I’m readyto face the danger.”Victoria’s acolytes watched him with admiration, which only seemed to increaseBannon’s eager determination. Nicci doubted she could change his mind, and sheadmitted she might need him. “Very well. If nothing else, you may be able todistract a monster at a key moment so that I can keep going.”Audrey, Sage, and Laurel hurried to give Bannon their farewells, and Thistlethrew herself against Nicci in a furious hug. “Come back to me. I want to seethe world the way it was supposed to be, but I want to see it with you.”Nicci felt awkward, not knowing how to respond to the girl’s enthusiasticembrace. “I will restore the world if I can, and then I will come back to you.”The next words came out of her mouth before she could think better of it. “Ipromise.”Thistle looked up at her with her large eyes. “And do you break your promises?”Nicci gritted her teeth and answered, “Never.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 51 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch51]After climbing down the outer wall of the plateau on their way to the Scar,Nicci and Bannon made good time even across the rugged, dead terrain. Duringtheir earlier scouting expedition, they had cautiously picked their way,exploring, but now that she possessed the right weapon, Nicci had a clear, firmgoal. With the Eldertree acorn, she was on her way to kill the misguided wizardwho had caused such appalling damage, had sacrificed countless lives, allbecause he feared his own death.Nicci considered the Lifedrinker a monster, an enemy to be defeated at any cost;she did not think of him as a sick and frightened man, a naive scholar playingwith dangerous magic. He was not Roland in her mind. He was a toxin spreading inevery direction. He was a scourge who could destroy the world.And this was the reason Red had sent her on this journey, accompanying Nathan tofind Kol Adair. Save the world. She would do her part.Bannon kept up with her without complaint as they crossed the worseninglandscape, and Nicci was impressed with the young man’s dogged determination.After emerging from the dying foothills, they made their way on anarrow-straight path across the cracked and rocky Scar. Wind whipped the powderydust of dry lakes into a salty chemical haze in the air.Nicci focused ahead. She did not run; she simply did not rest. The barrenlandscape sparked anger and impatience in her. She picked up the pace, coveringmiles at a steady clip. Bannon kept looking from side to side, wrinkling hisnose in the bitter air. They passed under the shadow of a goblin-shapedpinnacle. Spiky branches of a dead piñon pine protruded from a crack in the rockformation.Without stopping, Bannon took a cautious sip from his waterskin. A worried frowncrossed his face. “Sorceress, is it wise to travel out in the open? Maybe weshould try to hide our path so the Lifedrinker doesn’t know we are coming forhim?”She shook her head. “He knows where we are. I’m certain he can sense my magic.Skulking in the shadows would only slow us down.”When Bannon offered the waterskin to Nicci, she realized her throat was parched.She drank. The water felt warm, flat, and slippery on her tongue. She handed thewaterskin back, and Bannon fastened it at his side, then touched his sword andturned slowly. “I sense that something is watching us.”Extending her gift, Nicci could detect that this desolate place festered withtwisted life, the few surviving creatures that had adapted to the Lifedrinker’sevil taint. “Many things are watching us, but they don’t interest me unless theyinterfere with our mission.” Her lips curled in a hard smile. “If they do, thenwe will show them their mistake.”Nicci intended to press forward without rest, without making camp, until theyreached the heart of the Scar. They had left Cliffwall with the firstglimmerings of dawn, and after they had trudged through midday and into the dryafternoon, their pace began to falter. She and Bannon perspired in therelentless heat, and white alkaline dust clung to them, making both of them lookwhite as stone.Nicci brushed the powder from her face and arms. Her black travel dress was nowcrusted with the harsh chemical residue.After the sun set, thermal currents skirled up dust devils, blowing sand andgrit into howling veils. As darkness fell, the building dust storm masked thestrange stars overhead, but the two plodded on through the night. Near midnight,the raging winds had reached such a crescendo that she could barely hear Bannonbehind her, and they grudgingly stopped in the lee of a tall rock. Nicci said,“Rest while you can. We’ll stop for no more than an hour.”“I could keep going,” he insisted. His lips were cracked, his eyes swollen andred, nearly puffed shut.“We are too vulnerable if we continue in this blowing storm,” Nicci said. “If wecan’t see, we might fall into a pit, or the Lifedrinker could send dust peopleto attack us. We will stay here until it calms. It is not my preference, butnecessary.”During the brief respite, she released some of her magic to dispel the grittyresidue from their chafed faces and burning eyes, but as she used her gift,Nicci felt the magic thrum and recoil inside her. Something else had detectedit, tried to grasp it. This deep into the Scar, the Lifedrinker’svitality-sucking power grew more oppressive. She immediately felt him strugglingto gain a hold on her, to sap her strength and draw away her powers. Her smalluse of magic had triggered his response.The howling wind and whipping sand diminished only slightly after midnight, butNicci decided they had waited long enough. “We need to go.”Bannon stumbled after her across the parched open terrain. The young man’sdetermined energy had flagged, and it was more than just weariness after theday’s long, rugged journey. Nicci could not deny what they saw. The closer theycame to the Lifedrinker, the more they both began to weaken from his dark andoppressive thirst. He was draining them as well.Hours later, the sky became a red haze as the bloated sun rose above themountains like fire from the funeral pyre of slaughtered victims. Far ahead,Nicci spotted the black center of the crater, a vortex into which theLifedrinker’s potent magic swirled.“Sweet Sea Mother, we’re almost there,” Bannon said in a raspy voice. He soundedmore relieved than frightened.“Not close enough.” Nicci tried to put on a burst of speed, which only showedher how much the wizard’s relentless drain had diminished her. If they didn’tconfront the enemy soon, she feared she wouldn’t have the strength to destroyhim, even with the powerful talisman of the Eldertree.Ahead, the ground became uneven. Slabs of rock tilted at shallow angles, as ifrestless upheavals continued to stir beneath the surface of the dead valley.Fissures sketched across the land like dark lightning bolts, and tall boulderslay strewn about as if the Lifedrinker’s rage of magic had scattered gamepieces.Nicci and Bannon climbed over the sharp rocks, tottering on unstable slabs andleaping across the fissures, from which foul fumes emanated. Even as theyjourneyed into the increasing heat of the day, the dark lair shimmered like amirage in the distance. Nicci sensed a prowling presence watching them, closingin, though not yet ready to attack. Although she remained alert, the Lifedrinkerwas her real enemy, and everything else was just a distraction.Though her irritated eyes were blurred from the dust, she saw a large shape moveacross the ground ahead of her, brown and angular. A hissing sound scratchedthrough the air, and a well-camouflaged scaly figure scuttled toward them amongthe rocks. The creature opened its mouth to reveal moist pink flesh, rows ofjagged white fangs, and a forked black tongue: a huge lizard armored withpointed scales, its back crested with a dark sawblade fin. The reptile movedforward on four legs, thrashing a long tail. The creature’s hide was mangy withoozing, red sores.Nicci backed away, and Bannon held up his sword to face the lizard. As itcharged at them with a swift skittering gait, Nicci caught more movement to herleft and her right. Three more of the giant reptiles emerged from behind rocksor beneath the broken slabs. She had seen the dust-colored lizards that Thistlehunted in the desert, but these were each the size of a warhorse. All werescarred with countless lesions and festering sores.Bracing himself for the fight, Bannon let out a low whistle. “I always wanted tosee a dragon. I’ve heard legends but—these are real!”“Not dragons,” Nicci said with scorn. “Just lizards.” But as the reptiles camecloser, flicking their forked tongues and snapping their jaws, she added, “Biglizards.”Beside Nicci, Bannon planted his boots in the dust and held Sturdy in front ofhim. Two of the lizards stampeded forward, focused on their prey, while theother two crawled on the rock formations around them, flanking Nicci and Bannon.The reptiles moved with a swift grace, warmed by the baking sun and driven bybloodlust.Nicci held out her hand, curled her fingers. She concentrated on the lizard’schest, found its heart, and as the nearest one bounded toward her, she releaseda burst of fire. In other battles, she had used her magic to increase the heatinside a tree, flash-boiling the sap and causing the entire trunk to explode.Now she did the same, heating the lizard’s heart until the blood burst intosteam. The monster staggered and collapsed forward, ploughing a furrow in therocky sand at Nicci’s feet. She knew she could make swift work of all fourlizard attackers.But after killing the first one, she felt a wave of dizziness. By releasing hergift, it was as if she had opened a floodgate to the Lifedrinker. Even fromafar, he began to steal her magic, siphoning off her strength.Long ago, Nicci herself had assimilated the powers of other wizards she hadkilled, and now the same thing was happening to her. Roland was stealing herlife. In a reflexive survival measure, she wove shields to stop the bleedingrupture of power, but she realized she could no longer fight the lizards withmagic. She reeled and slumped back against the nearby boulder.Bannon was busy blocking the second lizard and did not see her stagger. Holdingthe grip with both hands, he swung his sword with all his weight and strengthbehind it. When the edge of his blade struck the scaly hide, the sound that rangout was like the tongs and hammer in a blacksmith’s shop. He wavered as theblade ricocheted off the lizard’s armor, leaving no obvious injury.The reptile lunged back toward him. Bannon recovered and spun, clattering hissword across the scales, to little effect. When he finally pierced one of theoozing, mangy patches, the lizard did recoil and squirm, but then it keptcoming.Bannon smashed its head so hard that sparks flew. When the lizard opened wideits fang-filled mouth, he pulled back the sword and thrust forward with all ofhis strength, stabbing Sturdy’s tip into the soft pink flesh. He shoved harder,twisting the blade and digging it into the creature’s soft palate until it brokethrough the thin bone and pierced the small brain. As the monster perished,Bannon tore the sword back out, severing the black forked tongue, which fell outand flopped like a dying snake in the blood-soaked dust. The enormous beasttwitched and thrashed in a thunderstorm of last nerve impulses.Bannon spun as the third giant lizard approached from the left, climbing overone of the boulders. Sparing a glance for Nicci, he gasped to see her slumpedagainst the rock as she attempted to recover. “Sorceress!”Rallying herself, she released a small burst of magic, hoping to stop thecreature’s heart, but the moment she made the attempt, Nicci felt the voraciousLifedrinker snatch at her magic and her strength like a hunting dog clamping itsjaws around a hare. Before it was too late, she cast her protective webs againand closed off the attempt. Dark static swirled around her vision, and she fellagainst the boulder, but vowed not to give up. She slid the dagger from her sideand clutched it in a shaking hand, determined to fight with whatever weapon shehad—even teeth and nails if necessary.“I’ll take care of the other two, Sorceress.” Bannon charged toward the oncominglizard, yelling with wordless fury. Again his sword struck sparks from thearmored hide. He hammered and hammered with his blade, chipping scales anddigging into the lizard’s flesh, and he twisted into one of the crusted, patchysores. When the lizard hissed and snapped at him, Bannon responded with a primalroar of his own.Nicci had not seen him release such blind rage since battling the Norukaislavers, but something had unleashed his fighting reactions. He was morecalculating than a mindless dervish, though. Even if the edge of his bladecaused little harm, he raised the sword above his shoulder and drove the pointstraight into the lizard’s eye.With a gurgling hiss, the monster tried to squirm away, but Bannon pushedforward, driving his sword harder, pushing it in farther. He twisted and screwedthe tip so that it turned the creature’s eye into a soupy splash of gore. Itwasn’t enough.Throwing his full weight into the thrust, he slammed the sword through the boneof the lizard’s eye socket and into its head. The monster collapsed. Bannonheaved great breaths and struggled to wrench Sturdy free, but the sword wasstuck in the lizard’s cranial cavity. He grunted and cursed. “Come on!”The last of the attacking lizards crawled toward Nicci, cautious. She held outher long dagger, ready for the attack. The monster prepared to spring. She knewits weight and momentum would drive her backward. And she also knew she was tooweak to kill it.Just then she sensed a feral presence, felt the ripple of muscles like an echoinside her, experienced the anticipated joy of the attack and the kill. Beforethe giant lizard could crash down on her, a tawny feline shape bounded from theboulders above. The great cat hurled herself down in a mass of claws and curvedfangs and slammed into the distorted lizard, knocking it off balance.Nicci felt a surge of excitement and relief as she dragged herself to her feet.“Mrra!”The sand panther mauled the lizard with her long claws, ripping loose mangypatches of scales, exposing open sores. The monster writhed and bucked, but Mrrawould not let go. Saberlike fangs chomped down, working into weak spots in thereptile’s armor.Inside her mind, thanks to her connection to the spell-bonded panther, Niccicould feel the bloodlust, the energy, the need to kill this threat … this threatto Nicci. Mrra was born as a fighter, trained as a fighter, as a killer.Because she was joined to Mrra, Nicci wanted to tear this monster apart with herbare hands. A feral blood rage sang through her, as it sang through the sandpanther. She bounded forward to join the attack. She didn’t need magic, just herknife.Mrra pushed over the thrashing lizard to expose the softer scales in itsunderbelly just as Nicci reached its head. They seemed to be coordinated,synchronized. The monster clamped its fanged jaws shut, and Nicci drove hersharp dagger beneath the reptile’s chin, piercing the thinner skin of itswattled throat. She drove the blade into its head again and again while Mrratore open the thing’s belly and hauled out its flopping entrails. The lizard’sgushing blood washed away the caked white powder on Nicci’s skin and hands, butshe did not feel clean.Instead, she felt invigorated.By the time the fourth monster was dead, Nicci shook with exhaustion, but wasalso afire with the need to go on.Bannon looked ready to collapse, but he managed an odd grin, giving a respectfullook to Mrra. “Good thing I convinced you not to kill the panther, Sorceress.”“I agree.” Nicci looked down at Mrra, feeling the powerful inexplicable threadsbinding them. Her sister panther growled deep in her throat.Bannon added, “And I told you I could be useful. You need me.”“There are few things I need.” Nicci shaded her eyes as she scanned ahead,looking toward the dark vortex still miles away. “Right now, we need to get tothe Lifedrinker.” She touched the pouch at her side that held the Eldertreeacorn. “Before it’s too late.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 52 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch52]They trudged forward. The Lifedrinker’s presence dragged at their bodies liketar, making their movements sluggish, their bodies weak, but Nicci pushed aheadtoward the center of the Scar, and the wizard she needed to kill. For Thistle,for this once-fertile valley, for Richard, the D’Haran Empire, and the wholeworld …“We’re almost there, Sorceress,” Bannon said in a voice as thin as old paper.“My sword isn’t dull yet.”“He will keep trying to stop us, but we don’t know how he will attack us next,”Nicci said. “Be wary.”The young man managed a hint of cheer in his tone. “And I’ll be useful.” Whenshe made a noncommittal response, Bannon acted as if she had given him a greatcompliment.Mrra stayed with them. The sand panther loped ahead, her tan fur blending intothe dusty wasteland. The debris around them turned darker, sharper. The boulderswere made of shattered volcanic glass, with every angle as sharp as a knifeedge. Sulfurous steam made the air thick and nearly unbreathable, and each stepsapped more of their strength.But as they descended the crumbling, uncertain slope at the heart of the deadvalley, Nicci could see their destination ahead. Her target.The evil wizard’s lair resembled an amphitheater with black stelae, spires ofrock reaching upward like desperate claws that encircled a central pit. Waves ofthe Lifedrinker’s appetite had frozen into ripples preserved in the blastedstone.Overhead, thunderclouds strangled the sky, and a web of tortured lightningskittered around—electric whips that cracked across the sky, then stung the topsof the high stelae surrounding the amphitheater. The wind rose to a keeningwhistle, accompanied by a basso undercurrent of perpetual thunder.On the ground to their left, a slab of black rock split off to reveal a raw flowof lava beneath. Molten rock like the blood of the world spilled out from acracked, festering scab.Bannon staggered back from the furnace air. More obsidian rocks shattered andthrust upward, shifting, twisting. Mrra picked her steps with great caution, hermuzzle curled back in a snarl as more lightning flashed overhead. She prowledalong, close to Nicci.Bannon gasped, brushing loose ginger hair out of his eyes. “How can we go on?”Nicci chose her footsteps carefully as the ground grew more unstable. Sheclimbed over the sharp edges as she pressed toward the Lifedrinker’s pit,knowing she would find him there. “How can we not?”She felt the throbbing, desperate presence ahead, and she wrestled to buildshields around her, calling upon her knowledge to protect herself with bothAdditive and Subtractive Magic. She could not let the Lifedrinker seize hergift, her life. Nicci made use of new spells that she had learned only recentlywhile poring over volume after volume in the Cliffwall archives. It didn’t makeher entirely safe, but it let her keep moving.Plodding along in a determined trance, Bannon followed her, step by step. WhenNicci turned to encourage him, she was astonished to see his face seamed withwrinkles. His long reddish hair was shot through with streaks of gray. He lookedat her in turn, and his hazel eyes went wide with alarm. “Sorceress, you look …old!”Nicci touched her face, and felt wrinkles in her dry skin as if all the years ofher long life were catching up with her. The Lifedrinker was stealing the timethey had left. “We must hurry,” she said. She needed to use the Eldertree acornbefore it was too late, before the evil wizard grew any stronger.Dread built inside her, but it was not a fear for her own life, not despair atthe thought that she might be growing old: for Nicci, the greatest fear was thatshe might fail on a quest to which she had given her heart and soul, that shemight fail Richard’s dreams of a hopeful new order. “I am Death’s Mistress,” shemuttered in a grim whisper. “The Lifedrinker is no match for me.”Mrra hobbled along, and Nicci saw that the cat’s big paws left blood smears onthe sharp obsidian rocks as she padded forward. But Mrra remained close at hand,ready to fight alongside her surrogate sister panther.The static in the air thickened, and the background sound near the amphitheaterincreased to a crackling hiss. Nicci’s blond hair rose in a charged coronaaround her head.The obsidian rocks ground together, and a belching gasp of brimstone steamcoughed upward, nearly choking her. Nicci fixed her gaze to where the circle ofominous sharp spires cast dust-blurred shadows on the ground.Nicci knew the powerful wizard was inside there. She would stand before him, andshe would kill him, even if it cost her last spark of energy.“Lifedrinker!” she shouted, listening to the deep pervasive thunder in the air.Slashes of lightning whipped through the thunderheads. In a lower voice, shesaid, “Roland. Face me.”The ground shuddered and cracked, and scuttling forms emerged, black-armoredcreatures with multiple legs, glittering eyes, and segmented front limbs thatended in clacking pincers. Scorpions, each the size of a dog, emerged fromunderground nests to stand as guardians on top of the black boulders. Each longtail was capped with a wicked stinger that dripped venom.Beside her, Bannon gave an audible gulp. Nicci recalled that Thistle’s parentshad been killed by similar creatures.She stepped forward, remembering her main enemy. She shouted a challenge.“Lifedrinker!”Suddenly, she remembered what the witch woman had written in the life book:Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.More rocks shifted as the ground convulsed within the circle of towering stelae,and the blackness from the central pit seemed to deepen. Hulking shapes emergedfrom beneath the ground, withered and desiccated human forms, black with dust.Their sinewy bodies were covered with festering boils, sick open sores thatdotted arms and necks, bulges that pushed out the sides of their faces. Thesehorrors were worse than the previous dust people. They stood in a line, blockingNicci from going closer to the Lifedrinker’s lair.Mrra growled. Bannon raised his sword. “We can cut through them, Sorceress.”The blighted human forms lurched forward, and Nicci drew her knife, careful torestrain her magic, but knowing she might have to use it. With clacking pincers,the scorpions scuttled closer, weaving in and around the desiccated dust people.Mrra bared her long fangs, and her tail thrashed. Bannon stood at her side.“I’ll fight them so you can get close enough, Sorceress.” He gulped.Finally, with a swirl of black static and a slash of angry lightning all aroundthem, the Lifedrinker himself emerged from the darkness."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 53 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch53]The ring of distorted pillars surrounded an empty pit like the gullet of a giantburied serpent, a well that sank into the coldest depths of eternity. From thissunken hole, the Lifedrinker’s unchecked magic continued to absorb the life fromthe world.Climbing out of the inky emptiness from below, the thing that had been Rolandemerged. The evil wizard hobbled and lurched, swelled and shrank, a tangledconstruction of incredible power intertwined with desperate weakness. He hadbeen human once, but very little evidence of his humanity remained.He stepped out into the crackling air illuminated by slashes of blue-whitelightning that racked the thunderheads above. Dust swirled and howled, as if thewind itself were gasping in awe at the Lifedrinker’s presence.He wore what had been the robes of a Cliffwall scholar, but they had frayed andextended into long flapping shrouds that trailed behind him into the deep pit.Dark ripples flowed from his body as his magic stole light itself from the air,drinking, absorbing, draining everything down into the black well. It seemed asif a powerful life lodestone lay at the bottom of the depths—a magical force sogreat that even the Lifedrinker could not escape its pull.When the wizard spoke, the words were sucked out of the air along with all othersound, taking Nicci’s breath away, stealing more of her energy. “Few come to seeme,” Roland said. He loomed up, his tattered robes whipping about in the stormof his own energy.She touched the pocket of her black dress, felt the hard kernel of the Eldertreeacorn. She took a step closer, remembering many other terrible foes she hadfaced, and defeated. “I came to destroy you.”“Yes … I know,” said the wizard. “Others have tried.”Nicci heard no defiance or arrogance in his voice, just an odd undertone ofdespair.His face was long and gaunt, the cheeks sunken, his large eyes red withsickness. Roland’s neck was so thin that the tendons stood out like ropes. Asthe fabric of his flapping robes exposed his bare chest, Nicci was appalled tosee his ribs laced with a tangle of swollen growths, as if his torso werecomposed entirely of tumors. The chaotic protrusions pulsed and throbbed,reservoirs of misdirected life energy that had grown within him and keptgrowing, desperate for nourishment. The wasting disease had extinguishedeverything that had been the weak-willed wizard, and controlled him.His legs were bent, his spine twisted. The Lifedrinker lived because he was astructure of stolen life, a jumble of patched-together flesh, muscle, organs.“Please…” he said, in a much quieter voice that surged to a roar. “I hunger … Ithirst … I need!” He swayed.The dust people around the circle of obsidian pillars stood motionless.Bannon held his sword, but could not conceal that his hands were shaking.Mrra crouched, growling, but did not move.The Lifedrinker raised his hands. His fingers were mere sticks covered with afilm of skin—no matter how much life he drained from the world, it was notenough, never enough. He curled his hands in a beseeching gesture. “I did notintend this. I don’t want this.” He heaved a deep breath, and lightning skirledall around them, striking the tops of the obsidian stelae. “I cannot stop this!”the Lifedrinker moaned.Even as she felt the years and the life draining away from her in the inexorabletug of the evil wizard, Nicci stepped across the uneven ground. “Then I willstop you.” She would fight him, hurl him back into the endless pit. TheEldertree acorn might be the most powerful weapon she’d ever held.But the terrible drain wrung vitality from her muscles and made her thoughtsfuzzy.An uncanny flash flickered in the Lifedrinker’s sunken eyes. The tumors thatcomprised his body writhed like a nest of vipers ready to strike. “No,” he said,“I must survive. I have to.”An army of unwieldy but deadly marionettes, the dust people began to move. Morethan a hundred of them lurched into motion, ready to attack.Nicci forced herself to move three more steps, and the Lifedrinker did notretreat. He seemed to grow larger, swollen with dark energy, like a man-shapedpustule about to burst from its own evil.The twisted, festering dust people surged closer. Bannon threw himself betweenNicci and the mummified attackers. “I’ll clear the way!” He lopped off adesiccated arm at its elbow, then sliced off the head of a second creature. Theskin-covered skull rattled onto the blasted ground, its bared teeth stillclacking and snapping.With the oustretched palm of his other hand, the young man shoved anothergrasping creature, knocking it back into two oncoming foes. Though by now helooked like a greatly aged man himself, Bannon swung and chopped with his sword,splintering ribs, separating shoulders, cleaving body cores. “Complete yourmission, Sorceress! Kill the Lifedrinker!”Nicci could feel herself withering with age and weakness, second by second. Sheremembered an old crone she had seen long ago in Tanimura hobbling through amarket at a snail’s pace, as if each step required careful planning and then arest afterward. Now, Nicci understood how that felt. Her bones were brittle, herjoints swollen and aching, the skin on her arms dry and shriveled.With a snarl, the sand panther also threw herself upon the dust people,shredding the husks of the Lifedrinker’s victims as if they were no more thanstraw and kindling. Mrra’s curved fangs ripped the reanimated corpses intoscraps of bone and dried flesh.Behind the dust people, enlarged scorpions moved with angular arachnid speed. Ina flash of tawny fur, the big cat dodged the venomous stingers, then boundedonto a rock, leading several scorpions away. When one of the lashing stingerswas about to pierce Mrra’s hide, Bannon swung his sword to amputate thesegmented tail. Then he skewered the scorpion’s hard shell and flung the dyingcreature into two oncoming dust people.Snarling, Mrra lunged back into the fray as more desiccated corpses closed in onNicci, who was fighting her way closer to the Lifedrinker.The evil wizard jerked his hands, guiding his minions. More dust people crawledup from hiding places beneath the seared ground. For all the attackers thatBannon and Mrra had already savaged, twice as many now joined the fight.Nicci didn’t have much time.The Lifedrinker’s sunken gaze met her cold blue eyes. “Please…” he said. “I knowI have caused so much harm. I see what I have done, but I cannot make it stop! Ijust wanted to live, wanted to stop the wasting disease from stealing the lifeinside me. I never wanted this curse.”He raised both of his hands, clenched his clawlike fingers into hard, bonyfists. His body swelled with dark ripples of energy, and Nicci felt a suddenflood of debilitating weakness that nearly drove her to her knees.“I don’t know how to shut it off!”Nicci said in a hoarse voice, “If you found the power within yourself to causethis, then you can find a way to stanch the flow, tie off the wound that isbleeding the world to death. Find it within your own soul.”His voice was hollow with despair. “I drank my own soul long ago. All thatremains of me is the need!” When he surged again, Nicci knew that the magic hadentirely possessed him. The spell had become a living thing in its own right.An overwhelming army of dust people closed in. More venomous scorpions clatteredover the boulders, rushing toward Nicci.Bannon fought with wild abandon. By now he was an old man with sparse gray hair,yet he still defended her with all his strength, giving the sorceress a chanceto make her move. The sand panther also looked old, her fur showing spots ofmange, but the branded spell-forms seemed to protect Mrra from the Lifedrinker’sdeadly appetite.Nicci herself exhibited many signs of age. The backs of her hands were a tangledmap of veins marked with liver spots on skin that had been so creamy and perfectnot long ago. Each step she took felt as if she were fighting against a wind oftime, age, and weakness.Behind her, dust people closed around Bannon, but he kept fighting, hacking,chopping them to pieces, even though there were too many. Mrra dove into thefray, trying to protect the swordsman, but a new army of scorpions flowed in,stingers poised and dripping.Nicci took the final step and reached into her pocket. The Lifedrinker keptdraining her magic, and she could not unleash wizard’s fire, could not so muchas attempt any of her spells. He would only absorb them and then engulf her.Nicci pulled out the throbbing Eldertree acorn and spoke through gritted teeth.“You. Will. Stop!”The Lifedrinker swelled even more, looking at his creatures around him. Oddly,he cried as well, “It must stop!” With a surge of his magic, he stole more lifefrom the world, squeezing last drops out of the air, out of the dust—out of thedust people. As he drained his own servants, ten of the mummified corpsestwitched and then crumbled into blackened bone powder. The scorpions cracked,shattered, and fell into dust.The Lifedrinker howled, squirming in the air, raising his hands, as if bytriggering this last great call, he had accelerated a magical wildfire, and nowa cyclone began to draw down into the endless pit that formed his lair. “Saveme,” he begged.Nicci took advantage of that one second of respite. “No. No one can save you,Lifedrinker.”He whispered, “I … am … Roland.”Nicci held out her palm, cupping the last acorn of the Eldertree, and released asimple burst of magic, gathering the air around her in what would otherwise havebeen a trivial effort. Instead of manipulating the wind to create fists of solidair against an opponent, she used the air to accelerate the acorn forward. Thelife-infused projectile sped through the air like a quarrel fired from a tightlywound crossbow.The Lifedrinker screamed, and the acorn plunged into his cavernous mouth, downhis throat.Contained within its hard shell, the last seed of the Eldertree held theconcentrated life of the once vast primeval forest. Deep inside the evil wizard,the hard nut cracked and released a flood of life, like a dam bursting in anenormous reservoir. Resurgent energy flared out in an unstoppable explosion ofvitality, of renewal, of rejuvenation.Roland let loose a shriek that seemed to tear open the Scar itself. The evilwizard was an empty pit, an endless appetite that demanded all life, allenergy—and the seed from the Eldertree contained all life, all energy. Thethrashing tumor-strangled wizard was like a man dying of thirst who now foundhimself drowning in a flash flood.His evil spell tried to absorb the limitless power geysering from the acorn. Thedust storms howled around the curved black pillars; tornadoes of unleashed furywhipped the dry ground, flinging sharp obsidian projectiles in all directions.Spent, Nicci collapsed mere feet from the edge of the Lifedrinker’s pit, unableto move. The battle within the evil wizard continued to build, and he howledwith agony. The acorn that had embedded itself inside him blazed and brightenedinto an inferno of life.While the Lifedrinker attempted to smother it with ripples of hungry shadows,the remaining dust people collapsed in a rattle of bones and dried skin. Thelast of the scorpions fell dead, their segmented limbs curling up tight againsttheir armored bodies; their stingers went limp.Bannon threw the bodies off of him and climbed forward to try to rescue Nicci.He tottered like an ancient man, barely able to survive another hour. Mrra, too,pushed forward, close to the sorceress. Although Nicci was wrung dry and utterlyexhausted, she felt the touch of her sister panther in her mind.The ground shook and rumbled. Stones cracked. Huge boulders fell into theLifedrinker’s pit. The towering stelae creaked, then toppled like felled treesinto the hole. The avalanche continued, and the sinkhole slumped, filling withdebris. Lightning struck all around.The raging battle of life continued. The remnant of the Eldertree struggled toproduce new life faster than the Lifedrinker could drain it. The bright flarethat surged out from the acorn dimmed and flickered away as dark magic continuedto fight, but the shadows faded as well, grew patchier, like a mist burning offunder a morning sun.Finally, the evil wizard, the Lifedrinker—Roland—disintegrated, his body gone.All of his death and emptiness turned to dust, and a last bright echo coughedout of the Eldertree acorn, washing over them.Nicci staggered backward, feeling the warmth like a summer breeze reviving her.Life. Energy. Restoration.Her joints eased and loosened. Her throat grew less constricted, and when shegasped in a long breath, she smelled a sweetness in the air that she had notexperienced since she had first seen the Scar. Nicci raised a hand to her faceas the dazzle cleared from her vision, and her skin felt smooth and suppleagain.Bannon picked himself up, coughing and shaking. When he turned toward her, Niccisaw that his hair was again thick and red. The wrinkles that had covered hisface were gone, leaving only his usual spatter of freckles.She brushed herself off, and her eyes searched for the place where theLifedrinker had collapsed, where Roland had lost his battle with the last seedof the original forest.There, in the middle of the vast dead Scar, stood a sprig of green, the onlything left from all the exuberant power of the Eldertree acorn. A single spindlysapling."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 54 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch54]On their long return trek across the desolation, the ominous tension lifted fromthe air as if the world had heaved a nervous sigh of relief. Though the Scarstill remained bleak and desolate, the Lifedrinker’s corruption was gone, andhis blight would fade from the once-fertile soil. The valley would return, justas Nicci had promised Thistle.The haze of blown dust and salty powder dissipated, leaving a blue sky scuddedwith clouds. Bannon looked up with a smile. “I think it might even rain within aday or two, wash the valley clean again.” He walked with a jaunty step,obviously proud of himself. He was battered and bruised, with numerous cuts fromhis last battle, but none the worse for it. “I fought well, didn’t I? Mademyself worthwhile?”Though she was not one to shower unnecessary compliments, Nicci did acknowledgethe fact. “Yes, you were rather useful when I needed it most.”He beamed.Mrra stayed with them, ranging widely, wandering out of sight in the rockycanyons, exploring the foothills, and then returning as if to acknowledge herbond with Nicci. The sand panther was a wild creature, though, and as theyapproached the uplift of the Cliffwall plateau, she seemed restless, sniffingthe air. Looking up the striated cliff, Mrra growled; her long tail thrashed.Nicci gave a brusque nod, which the sand panther seemed to understand. “Youcan’t go in there with us. That is a human place.”Judging by the branded spell markings on her hide, Mrra’s previous captivityamong humans had not been a pleasant one. With a flick of her tail, the big catbounded off to vanish into the dry scrub oak and piñon pines.Nicci and Bannon began the long climb up.* * *The people of Cliffwall welcomed them as heroes, which Bannon enjoyed and Niccitolerated. With a broad grin, the young man patted the sword at his side. “Ihandled myself well enough. I saved the sorceress too many times to recount.”Nicci was sure he would recount them anyway.Bannon accepted the fawning attentions of Victoria’s three acolytes, who tookturns fussing over the scabs and scratches on his cheek, his arms, his hands.They dabbed at the wounds with wet cloths, then cleaned the dust from hisforehead, wiping his hair. Bannon touched a cut on his face. “Do you think thisone will leave a scar?” he asked, sounding hopeful.Laurel kissed it. “Maybe so.”Laughing, Thistle ran forward and threw herself on Nicci. “I knew you wouldsurvive! I knew you’d save the world.”“And I’m glad you stayed behind, as you promised,” Nicci said.Pleased to hear of their adventure, Nathan stroked his chin. “I wish I had beenthere, though. It would have been quite a tale to include in my life book.”“We will find other tales, Wizard,” Nicci said. “We have a long journey ahead ofus yet. Our work here is done.”“Yes, your work is done.” He smiled and nodded. “And now that the Lifedrinkerhas been dispatched, our focus should be on finding Kol Adair, so I can be madewhole again—it is quite inconvenient to feel useless! The Cliffwall archiveshave maps and charts of the world, and Mia will help me sort them right away.”As the ostensible leader of the Cliffwall scholars, Simon was grateful for whatNicci had accomplished. “Even from here, we could feel when the Lifedrinker wasdefeated. The weight of the world seemed lifted, as if something fundamental hadchanged.” He led the gathered scholars in a loud cheer to thank Nicci andBannon. “Before we devote our full attentions to learning and cataloging, weshould make an expedition to the site of the battle and see this new Eldertreesapling.”Victoria and her memmers nodded in grudging admiration. “Yes, we should all seewhat remains.”* * *The following day, nearly fifty people made their way down the narrow, hiddentrail from the mesa cliff into the now-quiet Scar.Full of energy, Thistle trotted along as the group worked their way through thefoothills and out into the devastation. The girl was eager to guide them alongthe easiest path, scouting ahead. “Now I know I’m going to see this valley theway it was meant to be! Someday, I can have my world back, green and growing.”“Maybe even with flower gardens,” Nicci said.She felt that the shadows were lifting from the Scar. They walked at an easypace all that day, camped for the night, and then set off again the nextmorning, heading toward the heart of the devastation. Mounds of obsidian glassstill protruded from the ground, but the stinking fumaroles had sealed over andthe exposed lava hardened. It was only the faintest, first step in the long,painful process of healing.Finally, near the end of the second day of travel from the Cliffwall plateau,the group of eager travelers gathered at what had been the lair of theLifedrinker. Nicci and her companions stood with the group, cautiouslyapproaching the crumbling debris that filled the crater.They paid no attention to the shattered remnants of dust people, the crackedscorpions. Instead, the amazed scholars gathered around the single oak sapling,a delicate tree no taller than Nicci’s waist.“If that is the sapling from the Eldertree, I don’t sense any magic from it,”Nicci said. “It seems like a normal young tree.”Nathan said, “All of its magic must have burned out in the final battle with theLifedrinker. This is all that remains, just an oak sapling, but it is alive.That is the important part.”Thistle nudged her way through the crowd so she could look at the spindly littletree that stood so defiant in the desolation.Victoria seemed disappointed. “That’s all? It was … the Eldertree!”“The acorn’s outpouring of life was just barely sufficient to win the battle,”Nicci said. “The power of life versus the power of death. It was a very closething. It gave all of its magic to destroy the Lifedrinker—another week or monthwould have been too late.”While Victoria and her memmers crowded close, the matronly woman let out a sigh.“It is a good thing our memmers recalled the story. Without us, we would nothave found the seed of the Eldertree at all, and Roland would still be alive anddangerous.”A flicker of annoyance crossed Simon’s face. “Yes, Cliffwall provided thenecessary weapon to defeat him, and now we must make up for all the suffering.”He raised his voice to address those gathered at the site. “It will be a greatdeal of work, but we can reclaim this land. The streams and rivers will flowagain. With rainfall, we can plant crops and orchards. Many of our scholars camefrom the towns in this valley, and we can rebuild and replant it.”Understanding the enormity of the problem they faced, the people muttered theiragreement.Nathan placed his hands on his hips, stretching his back. “The Scar can heal.Now that the blight has been eliminated, the natural beauty of the valley willreturn. It’ll just take time.” He smiled optimistically. “Maybe only a centuryor two.”“A century?” Thistle’s expression fell. “I’ll never see it, then!”Victoria was grim and determined. She muttered so quietly that only Nicci heard,“It will need to go faster.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 55 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch55]The land was dead and desperate. Victoria knew that the harm would take decades,maybe even centuries, to restore … if left on its own. That was unforgivable.She could not forget what the self-centered, shortsighted Roland had done, howthat pathetic man had killed the land … and murdered her dear husband.But Victoria knew magic, had memorized countless secrets of arcane lore. As themost prominent memmer, she held a wealth of magical information in her mind, andnow she searched for a faster solution to revitalize the great valley. Theanswer was within her—she knew it!Simon and his scholars could fool themselves that they were experts. They couldread books and study spells, but that didn’t mean they understood thatknowledge. Just because a starving man looked at a pantry filled with food, hedid not have the nourishment he required. The memmers, though, had all thatinformation inside them, part of their being, their heart, their soul.Ancient wizards had built this hidden archive to preserve history and lore forall future generations to use. Everything a powerful gifted person could imaginewas inside these vaults, written down in volumes, stored on shelves … and lockedin the minds of the memmers.That knowledge was part of Victoria.After the group visited the site of the final battle, the sorceress had seemedso smug, so triumphant about what she had done. Death’s Mistress! Yes, Niccimight have killed the Lifedrinker’s ravenous need, but she had not restored lifeby any means. That was a much more difficult and time-consuming task.Victoria found the spindly sapling deeply disappointing, even pathetic. Such asmall thing, without any magic? She had hoped for much more from the Eldertree.From when she was a young woman, she recalled the rolling hills covered withthick forests, the fertile basin with sweeping croplands and thriving towns.Though the isolated inhabitants of Cliffwall had only rarely left their hiddencanyons, they knew the way the real world was supposed to be.One of the first outsiders brought back to the archive after Victoria haddispelled the camouflage shroud, Roland had been an intense and nervousresearcher, an innocuous scholar who read volumes of spells and dabbled withminor magic. He had been quiet and good-natured, and Victoria’s husband hadconsidered him a friend.Early on, Bertram had noticed that Roland was growing gaunt and thin. Victorianow realized those were signs of the wasting disease devouring him from within.But Roland had refused to accept his fate; he had made a bargain with magic hedid not comprehend. Without understanding what he was about to unleash, he hadturned himself into a bottomless pit of need that siphoned away all life, notjust his own.Victoria winced as she remembered the fateful day she had come upon Roland afterhe met her husband in the corridor. Desperate, begging for help, he had claspedBertram’s hand, but was unable to control what he unleashed, and the magic keptstealing more and more from her poor husband. Bertram could not pull away, couldnot escape no matter how hard he struggled … and the monster Roland purloinedhis entire life, gorged himself on Bertram’s essence.By the time Victoria saw them, it was too late. Roland fled in terror, and sherushed forward to catch her husband as he collapsed in the corridor. She heldhim, pressing him against her breast and rocking him back and forth as he fadedswiftly. Bertram’s skin turned as gray and dry as the old parchments in thearchive. His cheeks sank into dark hollows, his eyes shriveled into puckeredknots of flesh, his hair fell out in wispy clumps. In her arms, her husbandturned into nothing more than a mummified corpse.From where he had retreated down the corridor, Roland had watched in horror andrevulsion. He held up his hands, denying his own deadly touch. “No, no, no!” hescreamed.But after draining all the life energy from Bertram, he did indeed seemstronger, invigorated by what he had stolen. Roland, fast becoming theLifedrinker, had fled Cliffwall, running into the vast valley. Only later didVictoria learn that he had killed ten other scholars in his frantic, blunderingattempts to keep himself strong, trying to get away from the isolated archive.Now the Lifedrinker was dead, but that was not enough for Victoria. She couldnot bring Bertram back, but she needed to restore the fertile valley andreawaken life, and she was sure she had the power to do so. Unlike the deluded,inept Roland, she would not make any mistakes.…By the time the expedition returned to the plateau two days later, Victoria knewwhat she had to do. Sage, Laurel, and Audrey were her three best memmers, butshe also had Franklin, Gloria, Peretta, and dozens more students, all of whomwere repositories of knowledge. Even now that she had brought down thecamouflage shroud and made the wealth of knowledge available to any student whocould read, Victoria insisted on keeping the memmer tradition alive. Maybe heracolytes would remember something even more important.Back inside the great Cliffwall library, Simon insisted on holding a celebrationfeast, but Victoria could not pretend to be as overjoyed as the others. Therewas still so much work to do, centuries of work—and that was much too long towait.Much as the researchers had scoured the archive for a way to destroy theLifedrinker, Victoria now sought a fecundity spell, some powerful magic torestore everything the evil wizard had taken. If a corrupted spell could steallife away, could not another spell bring it all flooding back? Victoria neededto find that type of magic. Surely some solution lay among all the wisdompreserved here from the ancient wizards.She spread the word among her memmers, who pondered and sifted through thecountless books they had committed to memory. They talked to additionalscholars, who combed through now-forgotten volumes from the deepest vaults anddustiest shelves, incorporating that knowledge into their own memory archives.There had to be a way!Victoria met privately with her trusted acolytes, keeping her voice low as ifthey had started a conspiracy. “You are all fertile, all throbbing with life. Ican sense it in you. You must create life.” She smiled at them, feeling thewarmth within her. “And you have gone to Bannon Farmer?”The three young women looked both eager and embarrassed. “Yes, Victoria,” Sagesaid. “Many times.”“We are trying,” Laurel said.Audrey smiled. “Trying as often as possible.”Sage said, “But none of us is pregnant. Yet.”Victoria sighed and shook her head. “The seed sometimes goes astray, but it willhappen in the normal course of things. It is not enough, though. We will have totry something else. The ancient wizards must have known a spell to restore life,magic to encourage growth and rebirth.”“Restore life?” Laurel was astonished by the idea. “You want to bring back thedead?”“I want to bring back the world,” Victoria said. “A fertility spell to removethe blight and corruption out in that desolation. I want to bring back theforests and rivers, the meadows and croplands. I want to fill the streams withfish. I want to summon flowers and then bees to pollinate them and make honey. Iwant the land to thrive again.” She drew a breath and looked at her followers.“I refuse to wait decades for that to happen.”While Cliffwall scholars as well as the other canyon villagers engaged in giddyrevelry to celebrate the end of the Lifedrinker, Victoria’s special memmersmeditated, sifting through the vital information in their perfectly preservedmemories, searching for some way to accelerate the process.Victoria spent her every waking moment wrestling with the mountains of words shehad locked inside herself. Her head pounded, as if the proper spells werestruggling to break free, but she did not have the key to release them. Not yet.Standing outside under the great cliff overhang in the gathering dusk, shewatched shadows fill the finger canyons. Evening lights glimmered from thewindows of other alcove settlements across the canyon. Insects buzzed in a lowcontented music, and she heard the whisper of wings as two night birds swoopedby. The world seemed at peace, awakening.Victoria reflected on the damaged tower that had held the prophecy library. Shecould remember the terrible day when an inadvertent spell had liquefied thestructure and drowned the hapless but foolish apprentice wizard in a flood ofstone. Such incidents, even though they were rare, frightened the other scholarsfrom attempting major spells.Now, standing in the cliff grotto, she looked at the damaged tower with scorn.She had no respect for the clumsy student who had failed to understand the powerhe unleashed. Another disaster, just like Roland.Victoria would never allow such a thing. She had higher standards.As she thought of the mistake that had been made here, something clicked in hermind and she remembered part of an old fertility spell, not just for a woman tohave children—perhaps to reawaken the womb of a barren woman, like Victoriaherself—but a creation spell, a fecundity rite tied to deeper magic that couldincrease crops, expand herds, rejuvenate forests. She felt the tickle of faintmemory, a spell buried deep among so much other knowledge. Victoria tried tosharpen the arcane thoughts at the distant edge of her mind.She remembered her stern mother, whose angular face looked like the wedge of ahatchet. While her mother had forced Victoria to memorize the lore word forword, she had never bothered to make sure young Victoria comprehended what sheknew; her mother cared only that she could accurately repeat every line, even ifit was in a language neither of them understood. The woman had repeatedlywhipped Victoria with a willow switch, raising red welts, spilling blood.Sometimes, she had cuffed her daughter across the face, boxed her ears, or madeher bleed from the nose in an attempt to make her try harder to remember, to useher gift and make no mistakes.Mistakes caused harm. People suffered when an error was made, even an innocenterror. Weeping with sincerity, young Victoria had promised her mother she wouldmake no errors. And she had watched that woman shove her good-natured father outof the cliff overhang to his death—a deserved fate, according to her mother,since he had made a mistake, a potentially dangerous mistake.Victoria could make no mistakes.…Now, once she touched the scattered, ancient spell and followed the memoriesburied in her past, Victoria could see the words unfurling in her mind. Thearcane language, the unfamiliar phrasings, couplets with pronunciations thatseemed to defy the letters with which they were written. Victoria remembered thefecundity spell, repeated from generation to generation, passed from memmer tomemmer. The thoughts were faint and wispy, frayed from disuse, but she possessedthe knowledge. She could use it.Satisfied, Victoria reentered the main library fortress and hurried to herquarters. Though she had committed everything to memory, she lit her lamp andbent over the low writing desk. On a scrap of paper she began to write,preserving the words she had brought to the forefront of her mind, rolling themover in her mouth, making sure each detail was correct. She spoke the soundscarefully aloud to be sure she got every nuance correct. After she wrote downthe fecundity spell, she read it and read it again until she was sure she wasright.Victoria braced herself. She knew what she had to do, and she understood theinstructions perfectly.The land had already been bled dry. What did a little more blood matter?"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 56 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch56]“Cliffwall served its purpose, exactly as the ancient wizards intended,” Simontold Nicci and Nathan, still looking very pleased with himself. After the defeatof the Lifedrinker he seemed more relaxed and focused in his role, back to whathe believed his true work should be, though he still looked too young to be thesenior scholar-archivist. “Now, at last, our scholars can continue theircataloging and their pure research. There is so much to learn.”The teams of dedicated researchers returned to their everyday work of listingthe countless tomes, reshelving volumes by subject, and noting the type ofknowledge contained in various disorganized sections. Obviously, decades of workstill remained.Simon looked around with giddy wonder as he tried to encompass the thousands ofbooks shelved haphazardly in the vast library rooms. “The project seemsoverwhelming, yet for some reason, I feel energized now, more hopeful than I’vebeen in twenty years.”“And well you should feel that way, truth be told,” Nathan said. “Simplyrediscovering the potential wonders in this library will be an adventure initself, however. Besides, as you know, all the rules just changed with the starshift. We don’t yet understand how much of this information is still accurate,or if everything needs to be relearned, retested, rediscovered.”Simon seemed content. “We are ready, whatever the answer. If your Lord Rahlintends to create a new golden age, then all of this magic can serve humanity.”* * *Bannon basked in the attention, although one person could handle only so muchfeasting and dancing. He took a moment to marvel at all that had happened to himin the past month. Despite the horrific ordeals he had endured, the young manrealized he now had the life he always wanted.While battling the selka or the dust people, even facing the Lifedrinkerhimself, he had been sure he would die. But afterward, the colors of thosememories shone bright and vibrant—and they were stories that he could tell untilhe was a gray-bearded old man, preferably with a wife, many children, and manymore grandchildren. In fact, he already wished he could relive some of thoseadventures.And love! Here at Cliffwall he had discovered the joys of three beautiful womenwho adored him and schooled him in the ways of physical pleasure. Though atfirst Bannon had been embarrassed and awkward, he was an eager student, and nowhis nights were filled with warm skin and sensuous caresses, whispered laughterand shining eyes. How could he choose a favorite among them? Fortunately,Audrey, Laurel, and Sage were happy to share.For so many years, he had been trapped in a nightmare, and now he lived a dreamthat he could never have imagined.After the late celebrations, Bannon wandered through the Cliffwall complex,searching for the three young women. They had rewarded him most enthusiasticallyafter his triumphant return, but now Victoria had gathered all of her memmers,giving them some very important task that took all of their attention andenergy. The lovely young women had expressed their sadness that they couldn’ttend to Bannon, claiming other urgent priorities. He hadn’t seen them in twodays.Missing Audrey, Laurel, and Sage, Bannon searched the library rooms, the dininghall, and the acolytes’ quarters, casually looking for them. He found one of theother memmers, a middle-aged man named Franklin with large, owlish eyes and asquare chin. “Victoria took them outside, somewhere in the Scar,” Franklinexplained. “I think she found the answer they were looking for, something tohelp the valley return to life.”Bannon gave a solemn nod, not wanting to seem desperate. “It must be importantwork, then. I’ll leave them to it.” He went off to his own quarters, hoping theywould come back soon.* * *Thistle was still content to sleep curled on the sheepskin on the floor inNicci’s chamber. “I was worried about you out there,” she said. “I didn’t wantto lose you. I already lost everyone else.”Nicci’s brow furrowed. “I promised I’d come back. You should have believed me.”While the seamstresses repaired her black travel dress, yet again, she hadchanged into a comfortable linen gown.“I did believe you,” the girl said, her eyes bright. “I knew you would kill theLifedrinker. And now I’m ready to go see the rest of the world with you. Will weleave soon?”Nicci considered the long journey ahead, the unknown lands and the many possiblehazards. “You have been through a lot already, and our journey will be full ofhardships. Are you sure you want to go?”On the sheepskin, Thistle sat up in alarm, drawing her scuffed knees to herchest. “Yes! I can hunt, I can help you find the trail, and you know I canfight.”“Someday, people will rebuild Verdun Springs,” Nicci said. “Don’t you want to goback there? It’s your home.”“It’s not my home. I lost my home a long time ago. I won’t live long enough tosee the valley green and lush again, so I want to see what other places arelike. You’re my new home now.” She scratched her mop of hair. “When you leave,I’m going with you again.”Amused by her determination, Nicci readied herself for bed and lay back on herown blanket. “Then I don’t think I could stop you.” She pulled the blanket overherself, released a hint of magic to snuff out the lamp, and went to sleep."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 57 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch57]After the draining, skeletal touch of the Lifedrinker, Nicci slept deeply,plunging into odd dreams.Though asleep, she ranged far … and she wasn’t herself. Her mind and her liferode in another body, traveling along on powerful, padded paws. Her musclesthrummed like braided wires as she raced through the night, her long taillashing behind her, pointed ears cocked and alert for the faintest sounds ofprey. The slitted pupils of her gold-green eyes drank in the starlight.She was Mrra. They were bonded on a deep inner level. Panther sisters. Theirblood had intermingled. Nicci had not sought this strange contact in her dreams,but neither did she fear it. She prowled the night, part sorceress, part sandpanther. And more.Lying on the hard pallet inside her chambers, Nicci stirred, twitched, thendropped into a deeper sleep.Mrra was out hunting, and Nicci hunted with her. They roamed together, and joysang through her powerful feline body. They raced along for the sheer pleasureof it, not because they were in a hurry. Although hunger gnawed at her belly,she was not starving and she knew she would find food. She always did. With herpanther senses, Mrra could catch any scent of prey on the wind, hear themovement of a rodent, see any flicker in the deepest shadows.And she was free! No longer a prisoner of the handlers. She was wild, as a sandpanther was meant to be.Mrra flowed through the night, exploring the edge of the Scar, which no longersmelled of the festering blight, sour and bitter magic, such as what she hadexperienced in the great city. This night, the Scar was quiet and Mrra senseddeath and silence, but there would also be prey as creatures ventured back intothe crumbling wasteland.Mrra clung to her connection with Nicci. Throughout her life, the sand pantherhad been spell-bonded with her two sisters, cubs from the same litter, boundinexorably together by the wizard commander, and then turned over to thehandlers for training.Now Mrra’s sister panthers were dead, slain in combat—as they were meant to die.Nicci and her companions had killed them, the girl and the young male warrior,but Mrra held no hatred for what the others had done. In the troka, thespell-bonded panthers were meant to fight, just as they were meant to eat,breathe, and mate.The big cat could not think far ahead, did not plan or envision things thatmight be. Nicci was her bonded partner now. A longing growl rumbled through herchest, and she hoped that she and Nicci could fight together again, side byside. They could tear apart many enemies, just as they had fought the giantlizards or against the Lifedrinker.Mrra bounded onto a slickrock outcropping, where she sat on her haunches underthe moonlight, staring across the landscape. Narrowing her golden eyes,twitching her tail, she sniffed the air. Her whiskers vibrated. The hunt wasjust like a battle, and every day was a battle. Her troka had escaped from thegreat city after killing their handlers, and then the three sister panthersraced into the expansive wilderness and the life they were meant to have.All three of them had been free, for a time.As Nicci stirred in her sleep, the dreams became more vivid, the memories moreprecise.…Violent experiences, razor-sharp recollections of razor-sharp pain. She had beenyoung, and her life was full of mirth and joy as she played with her sistercubs. Then the wizard commander had seized them, forcibly holding the young cubsdown while he brought out white-hot irons tipped with spell symbols. Mrra hadthrashed, and raked the handlers with her claws, but the leering wizardcommander had thrust the searing brand against her hide, burning the symbolsinto her skin, sizzling the tawny fur. The smoke of burned flesh and hair roseup in a thick cloud, stirred by her feline shriek.The agony had been unforgettable, and Mrra’s pain resonated with the pain of hersister panthers bonded to her, as the spells braided the three into a troka sothat they shared their minds, their thoughts, and their blood.That was just the beginning. Once the three panthers were linked by the firstblazing symbol, the wizard commander branded more spells into their flesh. Andbecause the three panthers were connected, each one experienced the hideous painagain and again, until their minds were as marred as their beautiful bodies.After the cats recovered, the handlers began to train them, using hard andpainful lessons that involved blood, prey, fear—and more blood. As she and hersister panthers grew stronger, though, Mrra learned to enjoy the tasks. Shebecame faster, deadlier. Her troka became the best killers the great city hadever seen.Mrra’s existence became the hunt and the kill. She learned to attack and slayhumans inside a gladiatorial coliseum. Some of the prey were terrified andhelpless: they ran, but to no avail. Others fell to their knees, weeping andshuddering as the panther claws tore them apart. Some victims were fearsomehuman warriors, and those provided the best sport, the most challenging battles.Other prey wielded magic, but the symbols branded onto Mrra and her sisterpanthers deflected the magical attacks.She remembered the roar of the crowd, the cheers, the howls of bloodlust. Withblood-spattered fur, Mrra would lift her head up to the bright sun, and glare atthe stands teeming with spectators. She flashed her long, curved fangs and letout her own victorious roar. She remembered the heat of the sun and sand, thetaste of the hot blood as it gushed out of a torn throat. Mrra rememberedkilling victims. Killing warriors. Just killing.Because if she didn’t do as she was told, the handlers would cause them pain.Now free, she prowled around the desolate valley, venturing back to where theyhad fought and killed the evil wizard. She saw human figures there in themoonlight, four of them, all females who had come out to the lone oak saplingthat had grown up at the site of the battle. Sniffing the air, Mrra recognizedthem as people from the city inside the cliff. An older woman and three youngones.They were not prey, and therefore held no interest for her.Mrra ran on into the night, hunting. She picked up the scent of a scrawnyantelope that had ventured out of the foothills. The big cat loped onward,picking up speed. Even though the antelope was nearly invisible against thedusty brown landscape, her sharp eyes detected the movement. With a burst ofspeed and fire through her muscles, she bounded forward.Even though the panicked antelope tried to run, hooves clattering over the looserocks, Mrra ran it down and knocked it into the dust. In a flash of fangs, shetore out its throat, then ripped open the antelope’s guts while the hooves andthe head kept twitching.The warm blood was delicious, magnificent! She began to feed with a contented,rumbling purr.…In bed, far away, Nicci let out a long satisfied sigh in her sleep."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 58 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch58]The great dry valley was intensely silent in the night, brittle with lingeringdeath when it should have been teeming with life. Victoria was offended just tobe here. This place should be lush with vegetation, tall grasses, thick forests,and fields of waving grain.Roland had caused this—stolen all the life, sterilized the land. Even thoughNicci had stopped him, that was only part of the solution, and Victoria wouldnot settle for half measures. The others at Cliffwall could congratulate oneanother, but there was far too much work to do. She would not rest until the jobwas done, and she could trust no one else to take the necessary measures.Accompanied by the three loyal young women, she left Cliffwall in the gatheringdarkness, and together they made their swift expedition across the wasteland outto the site of the Lifedrinker’s lair. Laurel, Audrey, and Sage were eager tohelp, their shining eyes filled with hope. Though the journey took them nearlytwo days, Victoria had revealed only part of what she intended to do, but thesewere her acolytes and they would submit to the world’s need.“Our work here is not for personal gain,” she said to them. “It will be atriumph for every living man, woman, and child.”At last, at nightfall of the second day, they reached the silent and shudderingarea surrounded by fallen obsidian blocks, cluttered with the broken carcassesof giant scorpions and the bony husks of dust people. It was a frighteningplace, and also a sacred place.Victoria led them to the lone oak sapling, the frail and fragile tree that hadgrown from the Eldertree’s last acorn.“It looks so small and weak,” Sage said.“But it has the power of the Eldertree,” Laurel said.“It has the power of the world,” Victoria corrected. “But its special magicburned away in the battle, and it seems to be just a normal tree now.Nevertheless, it is a tiny spark, a symbol—and we have the power, you three andI, to fan this small flame into a bonfire of life. Are you willing to help?” Shelooked at the acolytes in turn. “Are you willing to invoke the necessary magic?”The women nodded without hesitation. Victoria had never had any doubt.Standing under the moonlight near the thin gray sapling, Victoria loosened thelacings of her dress, then pulled open the collar so that she could remove thegarment. She pulled off the drab gown over her head and tossed it aside. Thegarment fell onto one of the jagged obsidian blocks, and she stood naked in themoonlight, smelling the dusty breezes, experiencing the chill of the darkness.She turned to her acolytes. “You three must disrobe. You are life. You are pureand fertile. And you must stand as you were born for this sacred process ofcreation.”The women did as she asked, pulling off their white woolen shifts so that theyall stood nude, regal and flawless. Creamy skin glowed in the starlight, theirbreasts full, their hips rounded. They let their hair flow loose and free.Audrey’s raven locks flowed back like a deeper part of the night, matched by thedark thatch between her legs, while Laurel’s strawberry-blond hair looked likegold burning in a slow fire. Sage’s nipples were dark and erect in the chill;her breasts were perfectly rounded, flush with the need to create new life.The power of their beauty took Victoria’s words away. These acolytes were thepurest personification of female energy, of life itself.A long time ago, Victoria herself had been just as beautiful. Men had lustedafter her, but she had given herself only to Bertram. With a long sigh, sherecalled that first time when he had taken her in an orchard on a night with nomoon, while the canyon brook made trickling music, but not loud enough to drownout her gasps of pleasure. As Bertram stole a kiss, then stole her virginity,they had lain entangled under the soft, fallen leaves, exploring each other. Ithad been perfect.After that night, Victoria had never imagined being satisfied with any otherman. She had found herself pregnant a month later, which was no surprise sinceshe and Bertram had enjoyed each other many more times. They spoke the ancientmarriage rituals to each other, reciting the words that memmers kept in theirminds. But only two months into their marriage, Victoria lost the baby afterhours of agonizing cramps and a gush of blood that produced a small fetus aboutthe size of her finger. It didn’t even look human. And there had been so muchblood.In her misery, Bertram held her, promised that they would have many morechildren. But that had never happened. Discovering that she was barren haddevastated Victoria, one of her greatest disappointments, one of her greatestfailures. She had never given birth to a single son or daughter, no matter howmuch she longed for it, no matter how often she and Bertram tried.She loved her husband very much, but eventually their physical pleasure hadbecome more of a duty, and a hopeless one at that. So Victoria became asurrogate mother to her acolytes and especially these three perfect, beautifulyoung women. Victoria claimed that she was now the true mother to so many morechildren than she could ever have had on her own, but she did not convince evenherself.After invoking tonight’s ancient, powerful spell, however, she would be motherto the entire world. Even with the price to be paid, how could Victoria have anysecond thoughts?“Male magic is the magic of conquest and death, of hunting and killing,” shesaid. Her voice sounded very loud in the silent, secret place. “Female magic isthe magic of life—and our magic is stronger.” She smiled at the three.Audrey, Laurel, and Sage were flushed as they stood naked together, breathinghard with anticipation. They moved slowly, swaying their hips, shifting from onefoot to the other. Victoria could see that they were aroused. Perhaps enhancedby magic, their own sweat, scent, and inner heat filled the air. Audrey reacheddown to touch herself and let out a small gasp. Tempted, Laurel and Sage did thesame. The night itself was charged with potential, with life. Even the oaksapling seemed to tremble.Victoria’s heart ached, and she drove away her growing dread, refusing to let itdelay her work, her vital work.As the three young women stood ready, their eyes half closed, soft groans ofpleasure came from deep in their throats. Victoria rummaged in the wadded fabricof her dress and removed the vial she had brought. It was a tincture bottlefilled with a deep blue liquid. “You must each drink of this. One swallow shouldbe enough.”Audrey reached out to take it. Her fingers were moist as she removed the cap.“What is it?”“A vital part of the spell. Drink.”Audrey took a cautious swallow, then passed the bottle on to Laurel, who lookedat it. “If you are certain, Victoria…”“I am certain. I have pondered long and hard. We must bring life back to theland, and this is the way we can do it.”Laurel drank without further question; then Sage drained the last of the darkliquid from the bottle.With a heavy heart, Victoria watched her three acolytes sway, then go limp andcollapse to the ground. They were so trusting.…Working quickly, she pulled their naked forms together, propping them up nearthe Eldertree sapling. Now she could let herself weep, because the girls wereunconscious. Hidden in folds of her dress, she had brought strong leatherbindings, and she lashed their wrists together, as well as their feet.The naked young women breathed heavily in their deep drugged sleep, but theywould awaken soon, and Victoria had many preparations to make.Copying what she had memorized in the ancient book and what she had drawn on herscrap of paper for absolute certainty, Victoria scribed a complex spell-form onthe ground, etching out the angles and curves of symbols in a long-forgottenlanguage so that the pattern surrounded her acolytes. They were her seeds now;they were the start of new life, the power of which could not be measured.But there was a cost—there was always a cost. Life required life. Blood requiredblood.Victoria shuddered as she finished the pattern, telling herself repeatedly thatthe benefit was worth the cost. The fecundity spell left no doubt: these threedroplets of life would unleash a vivifying downpour. They would restore thisverdant valley and heal the wound in the world.But, oh, Audrey, Laurel, and Sage …Victoria paused to suck in a long shaking breath, and then she let herself sob.Tears flowed down her cheeks. But it had to be done.When she looked up many minutes later, Victoria saw that the three acolytes hadawakened, sooner than expected. Their eyes were still groggy and confused, butthe spell required that they had to be conscious, had to be willing. They hadalready given Victoria their permission.“What are you doing?” asked Laurel. “What’s happening?”“You’re saving us all.” With tears pouring down her face, the matronly womantook the knife from her wadded dress and knelt beside the first acolyte.Sage’s eyes went wide, and she squirmed in fear as Victoria drew the razor edgeacross her throat, spilling a river of blood down her neck and over the swell ofher perfect breasts. Her heart kept pumping, gushing out her life’s blood ontothe achingly sterile ground.“I’m sorry,” Victoria said as she moved to Audrey. Gathering the girl’s longdark hair in one hand, she pulled back Audrey’s head and slashed her throat.Laurel looked up at her in defiance, her jaws clenched. She struggled againstthe leather bonds for just a moment, but her shoulders slumped as she felt hertwo companions sag in death against her, still bubbling blood across the ground.In a quavering voice, Laurel said, “Tell me it is necessary.”“There is no other way,” Victoria answered.Then Laurel lifted her chin, and Victoria slashed for the third and final time.When the girls had finished their long wet dying, Victoria wailed with grief.These had been like her daughters, her perfect followers … and she’d killedthem. But she had done it to bring life.Now, Victoria worked the spell. The restoration magic unleashed a flood offecundity strong enough to bring back the forests, the meadows, the grassyplains, the croplands.Rich blood poured out of the three sacrifices, and Victoria spoke theincantation that she had so perfectly memorized and practiced. The blood flowedlike runnels of melted candle wax into the spell-forms she had etched there. Theliquid glowed a deep red like lava … and then the blood changed, darkened,freshened. It turned green and bright as it seeped into the devastated soil,which began to awaken.Tiny shoots appeared in the brown dust; blades of grass, wide-leaved weeds,tangled green branches, bushes, and flowers sprang up.Victoria stood back and gasped in wonder. The Eldertree sapling grew upward andoutward, and more branches unfurled as it rose taller and spread itself. Fernsuncurled like bullwhips and expanded into fanlike fronds. Colorful mushroomsboiled out of the ground, swelled, and burst in an eruption of spores that ledto another generation of furiously growing fungi. The ground simmered andcrackled as it awakened.Newborn insects scuttled around, and the night was abuzz with flyingcreatures—moths with bright feathery wings, beetles with iridescent carapaces.Victoria stepped back and listened to the rush of life. Inhaling deeply, shesmelled moisture, pollen, the perfume of flowers, the resinous scent of freshtrees, the waxy green aroma of leaves. Vines scrambled out of the ground likeserpents, following the lines of spilled blood. Roots expanded and thrashed,knitting the broken soil together, raising woody stems and bunches of leaves.Tendrils coiled around the bloodstained bodies of the sacrifices, engulfing thethree young women as fertilizer, as trophies.Victoria stared around herself with wonder. She had never felt so much lifebefore, and she had created this! She had sparked this rebirth. Her rejuvenationspell was powerful enough to overwhelm the damage done by the Lifedrinker.The verdant forest seemed manic, exploding with life, desperate to reclaim lostterritory. Victoria stepped back, proud of what she had done. The scholars atCliffwall would see the rebirth here, and they would know that Victoria wasresponsible for it. She stood there naked and pleased, satisfied with heraccomplishment. She closed her eyes and let out a sigh of gratitude.Something seized her ankle. Her eyes flew open and she saw a writhing vinecoiling upward, touching her calf. With the speed of a striking viper, itwrapped around her knee and held tight.She cried out and tried to pull back, but the vine was as unyielding as an ironspring. It tugged in response, dragging her back. Ferns uncurled, bowing overher, closing in. Branches extended toward her, and she struggled to push themaway. A curling twig caught her wrist. Vines erupted from the ground, like aswarm of thrashing tentacles that seized her legs. More writhed up to encircleher waist and then tightened.Victoria screamed and tried to pull away. Roots grabbed her feet, anchoring her.“No! I didn’t—!”As she shouted, a leafy branch thrust into her mouth and pushed into her throat.She gagged and coughed. Fresh green fronds wrapped around her eyes, blindfoldingher. She thrashed her head from side to side, choking.Tendrils thrust into her nostrils, growing deep into her head, while otherspoked into her ears and explored deeper. She couldn’t scream, couldn’t see,couldn’t breathe. Victoria fought as the vines squeezed tighter.Then, like the arms of a mighty muscled warrior, the vines pulled her legsapart. She writhed, twisting her hips in a desperate attempt to get away. Shefelt another vine rising up along her legs, gliding against the side of herthigh, then, with only the slightest hesitation, it plunged between her legs andthrust upward, swelling there, filling her.The agony throughout her body lasted a long, long time, before the tendrilsfinally pierced her brain, and her soul was swallowed up in a green darkness."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 59 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch59]As Cliffwall stirred with morning activity, Nicci awoke with the taste of bloodin her mouth, a delicious coppery flavor that felt warm and hot, but soon fadedwith the dream memory. She blinked and sat up.Thistle was beside her, shaking her shoulders. “I was worried about you. Youwere sleeping so deeply.”Nicci brushed a hand over her eyes, stretched her arms. Her body felt strange.“I am awake now.”“You growled and twitched in your sleep. You must have been having a nightmare.”Flashes of feral memory rose up like tantalizing mist-echoes. “A nightmare, ofsorts.” She frowned as she tried to remember. “But it wasn’t all a nightmare.”In fact, the dream in which she hunted with Mrra, in which she had been part ofMrra, held a great deal of pleasure. Nicci was strong and exuberant, herinstincts singing, every muscle alive as she bounded along, free in the world.Her human lips quirked in a smile.Thistle knelt beside her pallet with a look of grave concern. “I thought maybeyou were dying. I’ve been trying to wake you up. Your eyes were open, but theywere all white, as if you weren’t there … as if you were somewhere else.”“I was somewhere else,” Nicci said. “Gone on a journey. I was with the sandpanther, and we were hunting.” She lowered her voice, quiet with wonder. “Ididn’t remember my body here at all.”She went to the low table and splashed her face with water from the basin whileshe recalled riding inside the sand panther’s mind, as if she were an animaldream walker, like Jagang. But while she had dreamed with Mrra, her body herehad remained in a deep trance, completely helpless—and that concerned her. Niccidid not like to be vulnerable. She could never allow that to happen again unlessshe was in a sheltered place, watched over by a guardian.She straightened her soft shift and combed her blond hair. “If Nathan has foundhis maps, we will prepare to leave today,” she said, hoping to distract theorphan girl. “We have done all we can at Cliffwall.”The girl nodded. “With the Lifedrinker dead, the valley is safe. Someday, I’llreturn.” She flashed a bright, optimistic smile. “The people of Cliffwall willwrite about this in legends, won’t they?”“I have no wish to be a legend,” Nicci said.They would need packs filled with supplies, fresh travel garments, mended boots.Nicci was still uneasy about having the girl accompany them into unknowndangers, but Thistle certainly was resourceful, fast, clever, independent. Herloyalty and dedication made her a worthy companion, and good companions could bean asset when traveling.Nicci thought about the great unexplored continent of the Old World, where therewere new cities and cultures … perhaps with oppressed people, enslaved lands, orruthless rulers who would need to be brought into line for Lord Rahl’s goldenage. With a twinge and a shudder, she saw the vivid images from Mrra’s mind: thesearing white-hot pain as the handlers branded spell symbols into her hide, thegreat city, the huge coliseum, the wizard commander, the bloodshed.The great city … Ildakar. The word came to her, but she couldn’t be sure. Was ita name that Mrra had heard but not understood? The sand panther did notcomprehend the handlers’ speech, only the pain they inflicted. Ildakar …She and Thistle went together to the dining hall, where breakfast was beingserved as the scholars gathered, ready to dive into another day of research.Simon consulted with two other researchers, comparing notes on an old volumewith faded letters. Nathan and Bannon were there already at the morning meal,chatting together.Seeing Nicci, the wizard gestured them over. “We have what we need, Sorceress.Mia has found ancient maps, which show the landscape as it was three thousandyears ago when the documents were hidden behind the camouflage shroud.”“The roads will have fallen away, by now,” Nicci said. “Armies swept across thelandscape, kingdoms rose and fell. Cities were abandoned, while new ones werebuilt.”Nathan shrugged. “True, but cities are cities, generally built on crossroads andwaterways, near productive mines or fertile farmlands. If there was a reason fora city thousands of years ago, the reason is likely still valid.” He reachedover to tousle Thistle’s curly nest of hair, and the girl grinned and reached upto muss his white hair in return, which startled him. He laughed and said to thegroup, “And if the cities are different and the land has changed, then that iswhat exploring is all about. Besides, I need my magic back.”“We all need you to have your magic back,” Nicci said. “We’ll leave as soon aspossible. The Lifedrinker is dead, and I have saved the world, so I havefulfilled the witch woman’s prediction. Now we go to Kol Adair.”Nathan could barely contain his eagerness. “True, true, my dear sorceress—butwhat makes you think you will be required to save the world only once?”With an embarrassed frown, Bannon ate his oat porridge. “Before we go, I reallywant to say good-bye to Audrey, Laurel, and Sage. We’ve become very goodfriends.”The wizard had a twinkle in his azure eyes. “Yes, I suspect very good friendsindeed.”Bannon flushed. “But I can’t find them. They went away somewhere with Victoria.”Nicci vaguely remembered seeing the group of women through Mrra’s eyes in thedream hunting the night before, but she had not seen them since. She said, “Ifyou find them in time, you can say your farewells. But we are leaving.” She feltrestless, determinted to find Kol Adair for Nathan, but also to continue hermission for Lord Rahl, to move on to other kingdoms, provinces, cities, andtowns, all of which needed to know they were now part of the expanded D’HaranEmpire.A mousy young woman dashed into the dining hall, her short brown hair windblownas if she had just run a great distance. Sweat glistened on her forehead. Theyoung scholar, Mia, had often helped Nathan find required tomes in his searchfor defenses against the Lifedrinker. Now she ran up to the scholar-archivist.“Master Simon, something’s happened out in the Scar! I can’t even begin toexplain it. You must come and see.” She looked around the room and also spottedNathan. “Nathan, you have to see. It’s a miracle!”Simon ran his hands through his mussed brown hair. “What is it?”In response, Mia led them all into the tunnels through the heart of the plateau,jabbering. “Who could ever have expected this? Wait until you look through thewindow alcoves. It’s remarkable.”The crowds grew larger as they moved through the corridors, following Mia. Simonasked, “Where is Victoria? If it’s so important, the memmers should see this aswell.” He seemed to be trying hard to include them, but no one could rememberseeing the matronly woman or her three acolytes. Finally, they reached thewindow wall that looked out upon the vast valley. From here, they had viewed theextent of the Lifedrinker’s spreading devastation, but now they stared out atsomething exceedingly strange.Nicci came forward, focused on the sudden, dramatic changes that had occurredovernight.In the center of the vast, dead valley where the evil wizard had dwelled, thedusty brown had changed. The sandstorms and dust devils were gone, replaced by agreen haze over an area of new growth—a burgeoning jungle that arose in theScar. The vegetation was much more than the lone and defiant Eldertree oaksapling they had left behind. It looked like a storm of plant growth.And it was clearly spreading."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 60 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch60]When the magic revived her, penetrated her, and jolted her, Victoria foundherself alive … and more than just alive. She was exploding with life, seethingwith an energy that surged through her veins like the runoff from mountainsnowmelt. Her muscles writhed, teeming with new creatures. Every droplet ofblood, every scrap of skin, every splinter of bone, each hair on her head wasalive. She felt as if thousands of swarming bees or termites were energizing herwhile countless strands of plants bound her together.Victoria drew an astonished breath. As she inhaled, a furious gale rippledthrough a dense forest, leaves rushing and rattling, thick boughs swayingagainst each other, bending in reverence … to her. She opened her eyes, andlight surged in with all the green of the forest, the power of the soil.By shedding the blood of her sacrificial acolytes, Victoria had worked thatancient spell and unleashed a magic powerful enough to counteract the deadlyblight caused by the Lifedrinker. The destructive, selfish fool had broughtuntold harm to the world, and now Victoria accepted the task of repairing thedamage he had done. She was strong enough. Roland had been an embarrassment anda failure because of his improper understanding of powerful spells that he hadno business even contemplating.Victoria could fix it. It was her duty to fix it.Precious Audrey, Laurel, and Sage had given their lives for the cause, andVictoria realized that she herself had given even more than that. When theawakening forest seized her, co-opted her, she had not understood its intent.She had struggled and screamed, terrified that the writhing explosion of lifewanted to kill her. But no, that hadn’t been correct at all.Her spell had awakened an avalanche of exuberant, uncontrollable life,replenishing all that the Lifedrinker had taken, and the magic needed Victoriaas a conduit. Even as the vines wrapped around her, plunged into her mouth, andnose, and ears … after the writhing plants held her open and assaulted her, thesurge of magic was merely trying to make her something more, to build her into awoman so filled with the energy of life that she could guide the whole world’sreawakening. She would let it flow like a flash flood of fresh growth burstingfrom the broken dam of Roland’s evil sorcery.When Victoria stood up in the heart of the primeval jungle and extended herarms, she saw that her skin was the mottled green of countless leaves. Her handswere large and powerful, the fingers like small branches. Her muscles werecoiled and twisted like sturdy wind-lashed trees. Rising taller, she could feelher limbs creaking as if she were a redwood that towered over the forest. Hervision was shattered and dizzying, as if she saw through countless eyes. Sheheard the loud hum of bees, saw the colorful flurry of birds, swarms of brightbutterflies, fresh blossoms bursting open like a magician’s celebratory trick ata wedding party.Victoria was the embodiment of all this life energy, but she still remainedherself. With the release of the fecundity spell and the sacrifices she hadmade, the price she had paid, Victoria contained the sum of fertility—green,vibrant, and feminine. Through her own body and her own soul, she had givenbirth to life everywhere. In the new forest, she could feel the trees growingand spreading, the perimeter of her reclaimed green territory expanding like abold army that meant to conquer the Scar, and much more.This was just the beginning of her work. Victoria would do more than restore theworld to the way it had been. Why stop there? Why limit herself at all? Afterthe parade of armies and warlords, after thousands of years of bloody history,mankind had caused tremendous damage.The spell she had unleashed was extremely powerful, and the magic was as wildand unpredictable as life itself, but for so great a task, Victoria requiredlieutenants. And she knew exactly where to find them.Her three acolytes had already given everything. They had believed in her dreamand had never questioned her instructions. Even though Simon had insulted hermemmers and tried to make her feel irrelevant to the work of Cliffwall, thosegirls had been utterly loyal. Victoria would reward them now. With therejuvenated gift so strong within her, she had the power to do anything.In the swarming, boiling army of life that arose from the desolation, shereached out with her mind and her magic, searching in the dense underbrush, theswelling weeds and shrubbery, the vines that tilled the soil. She foundlong-forgotten seeds and sparked them awake.The bodies of Audrey, Laurel, and Sage had become a matrix for the regrowth.Their blood had spilled into the channels Victoria carved in the barren ground,where now the thickest roots and vines swelled, building and strengthening thatspell-form. But her acolytes’ bodies were more than just fertilizer—they werecatalysts.Victoria found the remains of the young women and rebuilt them, pulling togetherthe strands of their bones, reweaving their muscles, using soft plant tissue tore-create their flesh. She did not intend just to restore the three as theywere, however. She would make Audrey, Laurel, and Sage into forest guardians aswell. They needed to be strong enough to combat those who would inevitably tryto stop her miraculous work.After she re-created the bodies of the three women as constructs of the livingforest, Victoria bent close to the figures and exhaled, blowing the tingle ofirresistible life force into the parted lips of first Sage, then Audrey, thenLaurel.The bodies roused, and moved. When their eyes opened, the irises sparkled greenas if made from the overlapped carapaces of jewel beetles. The young womenbreathed hard; they opened their new lips and flicked out pink tongues, exposingsharp white teeth. Their matted hair was lush, like Spanish moss, and theyextended their arms and flexed their muscles to show off astonishingly beautifulforms, the perfect embodiments of femininity, of life magic, of the energy oflust and creation.Awake and aware now, the acolytes looked at Victoria with wonder, admiring whatshe had become. Victoria could not see her own body, but she felt its power, itsominous beauty, and the potential she contained.“Victoria,” said Sage, but she was no longer Sage; she was but one component ofthe three-part manifestation of the unstoppable spell.“Mother,” echoed Laurel and Audrey.Yes, Victoria thought, I am the mother now. The mother of all things.“We have great work to accomplish. We have the power, the magic, and the will todo what must be done. My original intent was just to restore this valley, makeit as fertile and pristine as it once was. Now I know that my ambitions were toolimited. I have been given a gift, and I now bear a tremendous responsibility.Through me, you all have the same duty.”She looked at them. “With the acorn from the Eldertree, we have the magic andthe spark. It is time to restore the original primeval forest across the Scarand spread it throughout the land, so that the whole world can once again beperfect, as it was when the Creator first manifested his vision.”Victoria’s dark green lips curved in a smile. Her three beautiful acolytesnodded. She added, “A world lush and untouched. And without humans to sully it.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 61 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch61]After seeing the burgeoning area of growth at the heart of the Scar, a curiousand awestruck Simon led another expedition from Cliffwall, rushing out to seewhat had happened. The people were guardedly optimistic. Life was returning tothe great valley.Simon made his best effort to find Victoria and invite her to join them, butwhen no one could find her, he heaved a sigh. “We cannot wait. Let us go seethis miracle.”As the group descended the plateau wall and headed out across the still-barrenlandscape, the glimpse of green in the distance made Thistle chatter withexcitement. She walked close beside Nicci. “Maybe it won’t take so long! Maybethe valley will be green again, just like I dreamed, and I’ll have a chance tosee it in my lifetime.”“The sorceress gave you all a second chance.” Nathan tossed his straight whitehair and strode along beside Bannon, who kept his hand near the pommel of hissword, pretending to be alert for dangers.Nicci glanced back to Nathan. “I helped kill the evil wizard, but do not creditme with this rebirth. It was not my doing.”Nathan said, “Perhaps the Eldertree still had a remnant of energy that theLifedrinker did not quench after all. That might have triggered thisreawakening.”Nicci regarded the verdant haze of forest that had already spread across thedesolation. Even from a distance, she could hear a stir of plants and branches,the buzz of life. “So much growth…” She frowned at the swell of green ahead ofthem. “I am concerned unless I understand it.”Nathan raised an eyebrow. “You find fault in an overabundance of life,Sorceress? After so much desolation, this is a good thing, is it not?”Her eyes narrowed. “Is it?”Sooner than expected, they reached the edge of the lush vegetation, as if theswath of growth had moved outward at great speed to meet them. The air was humidwith vegetation, thick with the smell of grasses, leaves, pollen, and the sicklysweet odor of explosive blossoms.Thistle gaped. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”Simon stretched his arms outward to welcome the furiously insistent jungle.“It’s marvelous!” Towering ferns unfurled, and trees stretched and cracked,rising impossibly high in such a short period, as if time itself had acceleratedto let the forest catch up for all that had been lost to the Lifedrinker.Branches stretched and strained, unfurling countless leaves. Twigs rustled asthey proliferated. Vines swirled back and forth like twitching tentacles. ToNicci’s ears, the stir of rampant fertility sounded sinister, restless … evendangerous.The tree trunks enlarged as they grew at a manic pace, groaning with the agonyof too much life. The stirring branches sounded like slashing blades. The plantsspread a blur of pollen throughout the air. Shrubs and flowers spat seeds, andmushrooms flung spores in all directions. Grasses rose up whispering andhissing.As the group from Cliffwall stood marveling at the unexpected sight, more shootssprang up, grasses and weeds extending from the perimeter to reclaim more of theparched desolation. This primeval jungle expanded at a tremendous pace.“Sweet Sea Mother!” At first, Bannon grinned in amazement, but the awestruckwonder on his face shifted to an expression of concern. “Isn’t that a little toofast?”Bees and beetles hummed and whirred through the air. A dark mist of gnats roseup like a wave.Simon shouted into the forest, as if he could summon a greater presence. “Thankyou! We are grateful for the return of life.”A stirring occurred among the trees and branches, and larger shapes flittedthrough the green angled shadows: human figures, female figures—naked, shapelywomen whose mottled skin provided perfect camouflage among the leaves. Thebranches and vines parted to reveal the three women standing before the gatheredscholars.The young women were as lush as the forest itself, their breasts and hipsswollen with life, their hair a tangle of matted leaves and moss. They lookedalien, their transformed bodies more forest than human. Their features werestill recognizable, still familiar.Bannon gasped. His lips curled in an uncertain smile. “Laurel? Audrey? Sage?”When the three figures moved forward, the undergrowth flowed along with them.Their eyes flashed an iridescent green. Victoria’s acolytes throbbed withfertility, the essence of the forest and life itself. They exuded a wafting andirresistible pull of attractive scent, like an animal in heat. Even Nathanseemed affected by their presence, along with Simon and all the other men in thegroup. The sexual shimmer pervaded the air.Bannon breathed heavily. Perspiration covered his skin, and he flushed withlonging. The look on his face was one of yearning and impossible separation.“You were gone,” he said. “I didn’t know where you went. I looked for you.”Laurel said with a vibrant giggle, “We waited for you, Bannon.” The other twoyoung women echoed her sentiment.“We wanted you here.”“With us.”Simon was even more insistent. His mouth was drawn back with male need, his eyesshining, even glazed. At the front of the group, he pushed forward, blocking theothers. “So much life, so much hope,” he said. “We want you. I want you!”“Yes, come closer,” said Sage, fixing her attention on him. “We want you too. Wewant you all.”Bannon tried to join him, but the scholar-archivist pushed him aside, raisinghis hands. He didn’t even seem aware of what he was doing. “You brought back theforest,” Simon cried. “You counteracted the Lifedrinker’s curse. It iswondrous!”The three green forest women reached out to welcome him. “There is enough,enough for all,” said Audrey. Their soft and yearning fingers suddenlytransformed into pointed wooden spikes. Their nails curved and became thesharpest of thorns.Drunk on the thick, seductive scent in the air, Simon didn’t notice. His eyeswere heavy-lidded, his mouth open in a gasp of a smile. When the forest womentore him apart, he didn’t even have time to scream. They stabbed him withwooden-spike fingers, raked him open with thorn claws. They sliced and unwrappedhis flesh, peeling it away as if stripping the bark from a fallen tree.Several scholars screamed as they scrambled back. Some let out moans ofdisbelief. “Simon!” cried Mia.Releasing a burst of defensive magic, Nicci knocked the rest of her companionsaway, sweeping them out of reach of the grasping, deadly women.Bannon shouted in dismay. “Laurel, no! Audrey, Sage!”Astonishingly, when the forest women tossed Simon’s butchered corpse onto thebarren ground beyond the fringe of the expanding forest, his blood was like amagical elixir, a potent life-giving spell. As the red droplets soaked into thedead soil, new roots writhed about like earthworms. Shoots of green grass andunfurling leaves lifted upward to form a carpet in the fading shape of a man.When the young women laughed, it came as the sound of a storm in thick trees.Nathan and Bannon drew their swords. Nicci stood ready to release her magic ifthe vicious women lunged after them. “Beware, the attack could come fromanywhere.” But the three acolytes did not step beyond the edge of the growingforest.Even Nicci did not expect what they all saw next. Weeds, vines, and thornybrambles continued to erupt from the spilled blood in the pattern of Simon’sbody, but in the thicker jungle, trees rustled, and the undergrowth backed awayas if bowing to a powerful lord. The three deadly forest women respectfullymoved apart as a larger form emerged from the forest: a throbbing female titanwith skin like bark, leaves, and moss, a naked body with enormous swayingbreasts, the broad waist and hips of a gigantic oak, and hair made of vines andferns. Her face no longer carried even a hint of matronly kindness.Victoria … or, what had once been Victoria.The fearsome forest woman towered above the gathered people from Cliffwall, andher voice boomed out. “This is my forest, and you are no longer welcome here—norin this world.” She focused her startling, burning eyes on Nicci, who returnedthe gaze defiantly, not backing down. Victoria added in a mocking tone, “For Iam Life’s Mistress.”Branches cracked. Leaves and branches swelled, and the explosive outpouring ofgrowth continued to spread."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 62 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch62]Nicci did not like to retreat under any circumstances, but the insane jungle wastoo unpredictable and could easily tear the Cliffwall scholars to pieces. Aswell as Thistle.She pulled the girl to safety, away from the thrashing forest. The scholars’faces were filled with despair after the slaughter of Simon and the monstrousappearance of Victoria and her acolytes, but she shouted, driving them intoaction, “Get back!”Nathan and Bannon helped to herd the Cliffwall people away from the boundary ofthe deadly jungle, and the others needed little encouragement to run.Nicci glared at the swollen, transformed figure of Victoria. The green femalething had an uncontrolled, hungry magic similar to Roland’s—and just likeRoland, Victoria would have to be stopped. For this, Nicci suspected they mightneed a weapon even more powerful than the Eldertree acorn.And the Sorceress must save the world. Maybe she wasn’t done here yet after all.As the panicked scholars fled back to the uplift of the plateau, Bannon withdrewinto a sense of sick denial after what he had seen the three young women do toSimon. “Sweet Sea Mother, they were so beautiful, so loving and kind. I lovedthem, and they loved me.”“They loved you so much, they wanted your blood,” Nicci said. “They would havetorn you apart, but Simon paid the price for you.”Bannon shook his head. “We have to save them! They’re entangled in an evilspell, but I know their hearts are good. We can bring them back, I know it.”Nicci frowned at him. “Don’t delude yourself with unrealistic hopes, BannonFarmer. Those things are no longer the women you knew. We will certainly have tokill them.”The young man stared at her, his mouth open in disbelief. “No, it can’t be. Mylife was happy, almost perfect for once.…”With an understanding nod, the wizard squeezed his shoulder. “Sometimes outwardbeauty only masks a darkness inside.”When they finally climbed back up the slope and returned to the hidden archiveinside the plateau, Nathan strode directly toward the large library chambers,wasting no time. “Once again, we need to learn about a corrupt, uncontrolledspell,” he said, “so we can fight it.”Nicci turned Thistle about, leading her toward their quarters. “I will destroyher, just as I destroyed the Lifedrinker.”The girl hung her head, sniffling. “I just wanted to see my valley restored, butthat jungle is almost as bad as the Scar.” Her voice hitched as if her throatwere full of tears.“We must eradicate both threats and help the valley return to normal, withoutbeing crushed by evil masters,” Nicci said. “That is what Lord Rahl stands for.”She touched the girl’s curly mass of hair, and Thistle looked up at her withcomplete faith. “That is precisely why we are here.”“I know,” Thistle said.* * *With no clear leaders, the people of Cliffwall turned desperately to Nathan andNicci for answers. The old wizard buried himself in the archives again,absorbing volume after volume, scroll after scroll, so that he could counteractthe dark fecundity that “Life’s Mistress” had clumsily unleashed.Mousy, dedicated Mia hovered by Nathan’s side, reading documents with lightningspeed, tracing her fingertips over the handwritten lines. She could take in thegist of the text and cull out the important books she felt Nathan should read.Nicci, though, decided to seek information in a more direct fashion. Because thememmers held the knowledge within their minds, she interrogated Victoria’speople face-to-face.Marching into one of the classroom chambers where the memmers would recite theirlessons, she faced them with her hands planted on the curve of her hips.“Victoria commanded you to search for fertility spells, horticulture magic, evenrestorative lore that could be applied to wildfire damage in forests. One of youmust have recalled the dark spell that she used.” She narrowed her eyes, lookingfor an unexpected flush or a wary flinch among the memmers. “Someone pointed herto whatever incantation or blood magic she invoked. I need to know what it was.”“Victoria wanted to save the valley and save us all,” said Franklin, blinkinghis owlish eyes. “She had only the best of intentions. We all wanted to help.”“Best of intentions?” Nicci’s glare froze them as if she were a predator aboutto pounce. “You never learned the Wizard’s Second Rule.”Gloria, a plump and earnest young memmer, frowned. Her lower lip trembled. “TheWizard’s Second Rule? What is that? Is it in the archives?”“Any student of magical lore should know it. The greatest harm can result fromthe best intentions. Victoria proved exactly that. Rather than patiently waitingfor nature to reclaim the valley, she unleashed even more dangerous magic, andnow it is out of control. With her good intentions, Victoria may well havedoomed us all, unless we can find a way to stop her.”Gloria swallowed hard. “But how can we undo what she’s done?”“First, we must understand the magic she used, the exact spell she triggered.Did one of you help her to find it?”The memmers fidgeted uncomfortably in their memorization room. Franklin said,“She hoped one of us might recall something that we had committed to memory, butthere were so many possibilities, none of them clear. She wanted to help thevalley grow back faster.”Nicci’s voice was sharp. “I can tell when you are lying.” They feared she wasusing some rare truth-sensing magic, but she did not need that. She could seetheir nervous twitches, their averted eyes, the sweat sparkling on their skin.She raised her voice into loud command. “Which spell did Victoria use? Tell mewhat blood magic she invoked to trigger that wild growth.”Gloria flinched. “It was an ancient fecundity spell, one that could awaken theearth. It was in an obscure language we didn’t exactly know how to pronounce orinterpret.”Nicci straightened her back. “So she unleashed such a terrible spell withoutrecalling how to say the words?”“She knew,” Franklin said defensively. “We all knew. Memmers remember perfectlyfrom generation to generation.”Nicci pressed harder. “You are saying that what we saw out there in the Scar,that explosive deadly growth, was exactly what Victoria intended?”The memmers were embarrassed. Franklin finally gathered the courage to answer.“We do remember some fertility spells, but we don’t know how to counteract them.Very few ancient wizards ever wanted to stop life, growth, and prosperity.”“There were some reciprocal spells,” Gloria admitted, “but they are dim in ourminds, relegated to minutiae. The details were not considered useful, and ourancestors already had so much to remember and preserve.”“Write down whatever you remember, and I will study the information,” Niccisaid.Gloria went to a podium in their memorization room, on which an open tome restedon display. During their daily lessons, the acolytes often listened to aspeaker, committing line by line to memory. Instead of reading aloud now, Gloriapicked up a quill pen, dipped the sharpened end into an inkpot, and began toscratch out words on a scrap of paper. She paused, closed her eyes to summon thedetails, then wrote more words. She kept her hand on the paper. “This is thespell that Victoria used. I think.”Franklin came forward to study Gloria’s letters, corrected one piece ofpunctuation, altered one word. The memmers gathered around, nodding as theyproofread. Once they all agreed on the precise formula and the arcane words,they handed the paper to Nicci.As she scanned the spell, most of the words were mere gibberish to her. “Nathanmight be better informed than I.” She tucked the paper into the fold pocket ofher dress, then extended a finger, scolding the memmers. “Ransack all theknowledge inside you. Find some way that we can fix the damage Victoria hascaused.”* * *From the window alcove on the outer side of the plateau wall, Nicci gazed acrossthe tortured valley, where a crimson sunset deepened like the blood of thesacrifices Victoria had shed. She had given the written spell to Nathan, whoread with great eagerness, then deep concern.“This is every bit as bad as I anticipated. Perhaps worse. The power invokedcomes from a language even older than High D’Haran. It will be difficult for usto find a magic powerful enough to overturn it.”“Richard did not send us out to solve simple problems,” Nicci pointed out.“Of course. I just wanted you to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge.”As the red-gold rays of dusk fell over the broad valley, she concentrated on theswarming forest at its core, the primeval jungle that glowed an unhealthy green.Drawn by the view as well, Bannon joined her, gazing out with a forlornexpression. “First, all life was draining away in the world, and now there’s anunstoppable flood of life. How do we fight it?”“We will find a way,” Nicci said. “And then I myself will destroy the woman whocalls herself Life’s Mistress.”“I want to do something, too,” Bannon said. “You and Nathan can study all thebooks to look for a solution. You both understand the magic and can readmysterious languages, but I’m just waiting here, feeling useless. Like I waswhen we waited for a weapon against the Lifedrinker.” He sighed in obviousfrustration. “You admitted that I can be useful, Sorceress. Isn’t theresomething I could do?”“Help the farmers harvest crops. Tend the flocks, work the orchards,” Niccisuggested. “Learn a skill, perhaps as a carpenter.”Anger flashed across his face. “That’s not what I mean! There’s got to be someway to save Audrey, Laurel, and Sage.” His face was wrenched with helplessness.“I love them.”“And they are hungry for you. Remember what they did to Simon.”His expression grew steely. “We need to understand what is happening out there,Sorceress. You know I can handle myself. I’m going to go on a scout, and I’llcome back and tell you what I see.”“That’s a foolish risk,” Nicci said.“You’ve called me a fool before! I want to do this. Don’t try to stop me.”“I cannot stop you, Bannon Farmer, but if you are going to expose yourself tosuch great and unnecessary danger, at least make certain you return withvaluable information.”He lifted his chin, relieved that she didn’t argue with him further. “I will.”Looking long and hard at him, Nicci added in a softer voice, “And be careful.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 63 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch63]Being surrounded by so many books and so much knowledge usually exhilaratedNathan. The secrets and stories contained in those soft, well-worn volumes hadmade his centuries of captivity a little more tolerable in the Palace of theProphets. The Sisters’ huge library held countless tomes describing magic thatNathan could never use, thanks to the wards, webs, and shields woven throughoutthe palace architecture, not to mention the iron collar of his Rada’Han. Still,reading the legends, histories, even folktales had brought joy to his tediousexistence.When Lord Rahl’s star shift had made all books on prophecy useless andirrelevant, he had offered to let Nathan keep one small library for his ownentertainment, perhaps even out of nostalgia, but the wizard soon decided thatwhat he really wanted was not to bury himself in old archives but to go out andlive his life, to write his own story. And that was exactly what he did.He patted the mysterious leather-bound life book the witch woman had given him.Now he had other reading to do. Vital reading.He let out a weary sigh as dutiful Mia brought him a new stack of volumes. “Ihave no idea what these contain, Wizard Rahl, but they look interesting.” Miagot directly to work, showing him a tome at random. Many of these new bookslooked waterlogged, scuffed, or tattered. “Somewhere in our archive we’ll find away to stop Victoria. Cliffwall has every answer, if only we can find it.”Nathan chuckled. “Are you suggesting the ancient wizards in the time of Baraccusand Merritt knew all there is to know?”The studious woman’s brow furrowed as if he had questioned her reason forexistence. “Why, of course! This is Cliffwall. All knowledge was placed here forsafekeeping. All knowledge.”He drew two fingers down his chin and gave her an indulgent look. “I’m glad youhave such faith in the ancients.”Mia nodded. “They were much more powerful than anyone alive now.”“But if they had all that knowledge, then why did they fail?”She responded with a stern look. “Just because knowledge exists, doesn’t meanpeople know how to use it.”“Well, I wish I had your confidence, young woman.” Nathan peeled open the coverof the book he had chosen, frowning to see that the pages were swollen andrippled, as if they had been soaked in water and improperly dried. Some of thepages were torn, the ink smudged and unreadable. He brushed clumpy dust off thecover of the next book in the stack. “Where did these volumes come from? Did youdig them out of a hole?”Mia looked embarrassed. “After the sorceress opened the sealed vault beneath thedamaged tower, our laborers used picks and chisels to break into otherpreviously inaccessible chambers. Some of the books had been partly fused intowalls, others buried under rubble. No one has looked at them yet, but I wantedyou to see them right away, in case they were important.”He picked up a third book, trying to decipher the embossed symbols on the cover.“I thought the damaged tower contained only books on prophecy. I doubt they willhelp.”“No, the prophecy sections were in the upper levels. In the final days ofbuilding Cliffwall, the ancient wizards were in a panic to finish, being hunteddown by the forces of Emperor Sulachan. The lower vaults were piled withlast-minute additions. No one has seen them except you, Wizard Rahl.”“Then I am absolutely delighted by the opportunity, my dear.” He patted theempty chair beside him. “Would you help me study them? I only have two eyes, andtogether we could read twice as fast.”Mia beamed. “I’d like that.” She sat beside him, chose a book at random, andbegan working her way through the smudged and faded letters.* * *Deep within the resurgent forest—which was her heart, her very soul—Victoriafelt the magic of reawakened life pulsing through her … and, by extension,through everything she had made, the burgeoning life that came from thestillborn ground. The tortured Scar had been as painful to her as the stillbornbaby that she and Bertram had so wanted to have.But unlike her bloody and painful miscarriages, Victoria now had the power shehad always longed to have: a woman’s power to create and nurture life. As proof,she needed only to look out at the flourishing new jungle she had created. Thegrowth charged forth like a wild stampede, but Victoria didn’t want to controlit, not at all. She wanted it to fill the valley, roll over the mountains, andsweep across the continent, pristine, primeval, and unstoppable.Life would triumph over death. Her unquenchable victory would overtake allefforts to stop it. “Victory” … the very word was in her name. She was Victoria.She was Life’s Mistress. Within her, she had a power to rival the CreatorHimself.As she pondered her new role, thickets rose and swirled around her body. Thornyvines and flowers exuded a heady, hypnotic perfume. The trees grew so swiftlythey swelled, shattered, and toppled over. And then even the splintered trunkshosted swarming worms and beetle grubs, as well as fungi and molds that churnedthe fallen tree into mulch, which became fertilizer for more life.And yet more life.Her acolytes, who wielded the same energy of vibrant fertility, had goneseparately across the primeval jungle. They were stewards of the reawakened lifenow, nurturing the trees, the insects, the birds, and more. Victoria would seeto that. The world would once again be pristine.As Life’s Mistress, she would never be satisfied to merely return this valley toits former baseline, an exploited landscape with enslaved herds and rigidlydefined croplands. Victoria understood now what her true role in the world was.All the generations of memmers and their preserved ancient lore had led to this.Victoria could not be content with memorization for its own sake; she had tofind those powerful spell-forms, the maps of magic that would let her accomplishwhat was necessary.As her unnatural body thrived and the tendrils of her forest conquered thebarren territory, her mind unlocked more of what it remembered, revealingesoteric and deadly magic that she could use.The wizard Nathan and the sorceress Nicci had searched for a way to destroy theLifedrinker, and she had no doubt they were applying themselves with as muchdetermination to eliminate her—and Victoria would not stand for it. She felt thepower of life, the power of the Creator, and knew she was stronger than anymagic those two adversaries could hurl against her.Even so, she did not underestimate their abilities.Although Nicci claimed credit for killing the evil Lifedrinker, Victoria knewthat the Eldertree acorn was truly responsible for that triumph. The sorceresswas undeniably powerful, nevertheless, and Victoria did not want to be hinderedin her sacred work. She already knew that Nicci was a nuisance, interferingwhere she was not wanted.Although Nathan Rahl’s ability to use magic was minimal, perhaps even imaginary,he was a man with great knowledge and experience, and thus a threat to her aswell. There was something about the man, and Victoria did not wish to besanguine about him, either.They both must be stopped.In the thriving thickets, trees, vines, and mushrooms swelled around her like abubbling life spring. The buzz of swarming flies, bees, and beetles hummed anintense lullaby. As her wisdom and power expanded, Victoria recalled forgottenmethods and incantations that the ancient wizards had sealed behind thecamouflage shroud, preserved for millennia among the memmers.With that knowledge, Victoria understood how to create a weapon to eradicateboth Nicci and Nathan, perhaps a weapon strong enough to tear down Cliffwall,stone by stone. To activate the magic, Victoria didn’t even need to move,because she was the forest, all the stirrings within, all the leaves andbranches, the wings of insects, the flutter of birds. Everything belonged toher, was part of her.She released the magic to create her emissary, an assassin, a manifestation ofthe jungle’s primeval power: a shaksis. A shaksis was a creature molded entirelyof debris, the detritus of the forest.With her mind and her magic, Victoria gathered up fallen branches and gnarledtwigs to serve as the bones and framework for the shaksis. She wove themtogether, building a wooden skeleton around which, with whiplike speed, shewound grass blades and dry leaves, forest mulch, and thorny twigs. Fungiinflated to fill out the muscles.Victoria summoned an army of worms, beetles, maggots, and other crawlingcreatures to expand the creature’s body. By the time the magical constructextended its arms and took tentative steps, its entire form boiled with athousand points of life.Two iridescent beetles, each as large as a fist, scuttled along the forest floorand crawled up the thing’s body framework. Its rounded head was woven of benttwigs and supple willow, skinned with bark, thatched with dry grasses. Twohollows formed in what should have been its face, and the beetles crawled up theconstruct’s head and nestled into the sockets to serve as surrogate eyes. Asplintered branch across its lower face made a gash of a mouth. It clacked andchewed, broken spikes grinding together.Pale green vines looped around its legs, winding and weaving into its flesh,like blood vessels filled with sap. The shaksis creaked as it stepped forward.It folded and unfolded its sharp branchlet fingers, while the two beetles insideits eye sockets stared out with a faceted, malevolent gaze.Made of the jungle itself, the shaksis was Victoria’s puppet, her surrogate, herkiller, a soulless thing that was merely an extension of the primeval forest.Victoria flashed it a warm and welcoming smile, a maternal smile. She strokedthe uneven chest, feeling the life she had deposited there, a new child she hadcreated. Into its hollow mind, she placed the details of its mission—images ofthe blond sorceress and the pompous old wizard with straight white hair.“Find them and kill them,” Victoria said. “Go with my blessing.”The animated construct turned and, with a rustle of brittle limbs, stalked outof the forest toward Cliffwall."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 64 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch64]As he scouted through the gathering darkness, Bannon felt brave and important.After all his ordeals, he no longer hid from his past, no longer pretended thatthose dark memories didn’t exist. He was not just Bannon, the son of a man whodrank himself into blind violence and abused his family, a bitter man whodrowned helpless kittens and beat his own wife to death. No, Bannon was nolonger defined by his father.Standing tall, he marched into the moonlit night on his scouting mission,wending his way through the still-dead foothills. Though the grasses and scrubtrees were dry and brittle, he no longer felt the Lifedrinker’s poison oozingfrom the hillsides. This was more like a normal landscape after a long winter:not dead but dormant, waiting to reawaken with spring. Now that the evil wizardwas defeated, seeds would germinate, shoots would arise, meadows and forestswould creep back.But Victoria had been too impatient for that natural process. With a sickfeeling in the pit of his stomach, Bannon considered the harm she had done withher explosive fecundity spell. Rather than letting the Scar awaken of its ownaccord, Victoria had effectively dashed icy water into the face of a deeply illperson.He gritted his teeth as he trudged into the night, making his way toward theexpanding jungle boundary. He paused to rest near a moonlit boulder and took outhis waterskin to drink while he listened to the vast starlit darkness. He couldsense the vibrating power of the proliferating forest and could hear theinevitable sounds of cracking, straining branches, growing trunks, writhingvines, stirring leaves. Combined, it sounded like evil laughter.A sad shiver ran down his spine. He knew that Audrey, Laurel, and Sage werethere in that mass of wild growth, corrupted by Victoria’s out-of-control magic.His heart ached for them. He remembered their touch, their kisses, theirlaughter. He smiled to think of their warm breath in his ears, how he had lovedto stroke their hair, touch their bodies. They couldn’t be gone now! They werebeautiful, wonderful, loving.Then he fought back a wave of nausea as he recalled what they had done to Simon.If the scholar-archivist had not shoved him out of the way in his eagerness togo forward, Bannon would have been the one ripped into ribbons of meat, hisblood spilled onto the soil to spawn more of their awful magic.He pressed his knuckles hard into his eyes, wanting that memory to be just adream, a nightmare … but it was real, in exactly the way his mother’s murder hadbeen real, the way he had abandoned Ian to the slavers. It was not a memory hecould pretend would ever go away.Feeling the hairs tingle on the back of his neck, he stepped away from theboulder, alert, sniffing the air. He whirled and looked above him to see Mrracrouched on the rock outcropping, her feline form sandy gold in the moonlight.The big cat let out a growling purr, but Bannon did not feel threatened. Thesand panther knew who he was, possibly even understood that he was the one whohad begged Nicci to heal her wounds, rather than kill her.Mrra just sat there watching the night. As Bannon studied the powerful tawnyform and the ugly symbols branded onto her hide, he was no longer reminded ofthe helpless drowned kittens. He was glad he had saved her, and in a sense, hehad saved part of himself as well. Those limp, dead kittens had been a symbol ofgrief and guilt. The Adjudicator had found that agonizing experience inside himand dragged it to the front of Bannon’s mind as his damnation.Running away from Chiriya Island, he had sought a life for himself, not just foradventure but for self-preservation. Since then, he had found all he could havehoped for by joining Nathan and Nicci. He had discovered not just excitingadventures, but friendship, acceptance, and inner strength.He realized that he had been fooling himself with the illusion of a perfectlife, but the things he had discovered since venturing out into the world wereso much more. More than anything, he remembered the look of respect andappreciation that Nicci had given him after he helped her kill the Lifedrinker.He had risked his life, given his all, and they had been victorious together. Hedidn’t think his life could get better than that moment. Such thoughts eased hisheavy memories of the bad things that had happened to him.With a swish of her tail, Mrra vanished like a moon shadow into the night. Aftertaking another swig of water, Bannon made his way onward, still hoping againsthope that he could save the young acolytes who had so captured his heart,although he feared it might be too late.* * *The moon had set, and the night held its breath while waiting for the dawn. WhenBannon finally reached the edge of the ever-spreading jungle, the demarcationwas abrupt, with desolation on one side and a madness of foliage on the other.He could smell the leaves and the resinous wood, the potent aromas of wildvegetation.Sword raised, Bannon faced the primeval forest, hoping he would not have to goinside. The twitching branches and gnarled, spasming vines unsettled him, but heshored up his courage. Drawing a deep breath, he called out, “I’ve come foryou!” He meant to shout, but it came out as no more than a whisper. His voicecracked.The vegetation snaked and curled. In the starlight, as his pupils dilated withfear, he spotted more movement, heard a stirring that was more than freneticallygrowing plants. They had heard him.Beautiful feminine forms glided between the trunks, branches, and undulatingvines. Even with the camouflage of their mottled skin, he could make out thebeautiful bodies that were so familiar to him.He said, “I came to save you.”Though the young women were fundamentally transformed, he still recognizedAudrey, Laurel, and Sage. His breath was hot in his mouth, and his pulse raced.He had seen what these forest women could do, and he knew they were monsters …yet still he wanted them. Their enhanced scent was thick in the air, making himdizzy.“Come with me,” he begged. “We can go back to Cliffwall. We’ll find a spell tomake you normal again. Don’t you want to be with me?”They laughed in unison, a musical sound that made all the branches stir. “Don’tbe silly,” said the thing that had been Sage. “We are so much more now. Whydon’t you come with us? Think of how we could pleasure you with all of our newskills.”Bannon could barely breathe. His vision blurred. They seemed more intenselylovely than he remembered them, more than anyone he’d ever seen, any woman hecould imagine. Something about their scent …Flowers suddenly sprang up all around them, a spray of intenseviolet-and-crimson blossoms that he recognized with a shudder. The deathriseflower! The smell made him dizzy, and in the back of his mind he knew that Niccimust have been wrong about these blossoms, because surely this was the mostbeautiful, exquisite poison in the world!Unbidden, he took a step forward. The three young women extended their emeraldarms, exuding a mist of attracting chemicals. The lovely, but deadly, flowersbloomed around them.Tears filled Bannon’s eyes, because he wanted them so much. He remembered howwonderful they were, how sweet and caring, how innocent, and yet how skilledwhen they had made love to him.“We can be together,” he said, “if only you’ll just—”Laurel interrupted him. “Yes, we can be together. Always.”“We want you now more than ever,” said Audrey. “We are more fertile, more filledwith desire.”“We can be everything you want,” Sage added. “And you will give us everything weneed.”They spread their arms, and their breasts beckoned him. Their dark green nippleslooked like flower buds. Bannon yearned for them. He had meant to come andargue, to fight to take them back. The sword felt slick in his hand. Even withits leather grip, his palms were so sweaty, he could barely hold on.“Come to us, Bannon,” said Laurel.The other two echoed the invitation.He could not resist. He succumbed, gliding toward the edge of the jungle.With a great blow, a growling, furred form crashed into him. The full weight ofa sand panther knocked him off his feet and tumbled him out of the reach of thevicious forest girls.The beautiful apparitions snarled, their mouths opening to reveal long woodyfangs. Their arms stretched out, coiled with vines, corded muscles, and tendons.Their fingers reached out for him, tipped with hooked thorns. The smooth,perfect green skin on their arms became studded with deadly barbs that drippedwith milky venom.Gasping, Bannon rolled over and tried to catch his breath. The spell was broken.Mrra bounded away, then circled back, snarling. The forest women reached outwith a thorn-studded embrace, trying to catch Bannon before he got out of reach.He instinctively slashed with Sturdy, lopping off one of Audrey’s arms. Itdropped to the ground, and its severed stump twitched, extended, and grew roots,digging deep into the ground while the arm continued to grope upward for him.Howling, Audrey raised the stump of her arm, and a new limb grew from thesevered end, a tangle of vines, muscles, and blood vessels reemerging to restoreher.Bannon hacked at them, swinging his sword sideways, then up, then back down,splintering the female forms. They did not bleed red, but spilled oozing greensap.“I wanted to save you,” he cried.The three just laughed as they regrew into contorted new forms with additionalbranchlike arms that sprang from their shoulders and torsos. Their hair became awild, marshy tangle of strands.The sand panther retreated, growling to Bannon. He backed away onto the rocky,desolate ground where the forest avatars could not yet go. From their verdantrefuge, they simply glared at him, and Bannon stared back, sobbing. Tears randown his cheeks. “I thought I loved you.”“We will have you again,” the women said in a single rasping voice like dryleaves crackling in a fire. “We will have you forever.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 65 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch65]The broad grin on Nathan’s face made Nicci immediately suspicious. “I may justknow where to find the answer, Sorceress!” The old wizard stopped her in thehallway as she made her way to her chambers, where Thistle was already asleep.She allowed herself a moment of hope. “You are certain of this spell?”Nathan’s smile faltered. “‘Certainty’ is an overused term, to be sure. I amconfident, let us leave it at that. See here.” He set the thick volume on abench in one of the corridors.He opened the pages, drew his fingers down a line of archaic text. “It is just aclue, but the best clue we’ve had. You already gave me the incantation and thespell-form that the memmers think Victoria used, and that provided someexcellent parameters for a counterspell or a weapon. We knew the essence of whatwe were fighting, but not how to do so.”He tapped a stained page where tight handwriting had run together as the inkdissolved. “This gives us somewhere to look, a listing of other books that alsoshed more light about the Lifedrinker.”“He is no longer a concern,” Nicci said. “I killed him.”“Yes, yes, but think of how they are connected. Roland’s spell stole too muchfrom the world, and now Victoria’s will restore too much. It is all a matter ofcontrol, finding a way to modulate the flow of hungry magic, the power of givingand taking.”“Like a valve,” Nicci said, unconsciously biting her lower lip. “The Lifedrinkersaid he had opened up the magic with his spell, but the flow was too strong. Hecould not stop himself.”“And neither can Victoria,” Nathan said. “Both Roland and Victoria were conduitsfor the magic. When you destroyed the Lifedrinker, you shut off his flow ofdeath. Now we must destroy Victoria and stop the flow in the oppositedirection.”“I couldn’t agree more,” Nicci said. She looked up as three scholars hurriedpast them, eager for their dinner. Another middle-aged man strolled by, holdingan open book in his hands, reading as he walked. She continued, “I simply needto know how to do it.”Nathan pointed at the stained pages again. “This listing identifies a volume weneed to find, and I have reason to believe it is buried in the vault beneath thedamaged tower, where those other scattered books were hidden. It is very latenow, but we can try to excavate tomorrow.”“And you know where to look?” Nicci asked, thinking of the unexplored maze ofdamaged rooms and passages underground. “Exactly?”Nathan smiled. “Mia does.”* * *Though it had left the riotous fecundity of the primeval jungle behind, theshaksis could still feel the power of Life’s Mistress driving its mission. Asthe creature walked across the desolate ground on limbs made of twisted vinesand leaves, motivated by swarms of worms, spiders, and insects, the shaksis keptdrawing energy from a distance.It continued across the desolate Scar through the night. Though parts broke offin the dry rocks and jagged uplifts, the shaksis replenished itself with plantmatter once it reached the foothills and walked through scrub brush and tangledgrasses. The dead vegetation came alive again, whipping around its body,strengthening its limbs, winding like armor around its body core.Finally, in the darkest hour before dawn, the creature faced the sheer cliff ofthe plateau uplift. The shaksis knew that its two victims were inside the hiddenenclave high above.Because Victoria knew all about Cliffwall, the shaksis remembered how to ascendthat sheer rock, using the hidden handholds and the faint trail that hadisolated the great archive for millennia. The golem of reanimated twigs andvines turned its hollow head upward and stared at the cliff with living-beetleeyes.An agile person could climb the path to reach the hooded overhang above, but theshaksis did not need agility; it had a different kind of power. It reached outwith the splayed branches of its hands and touched the stone. With a surge ofvibrant life, the fingers grew. Vine tendrils extended and worked their way intothe rock, like the roots of a clinging windswept tree. The shaksis reached witha branchy arm, slapped its hand higher up, and fastened with root tendrils. Itsbulging wooden muscles groaned. The vermin infesting its hollow body skitteredaround, adding energy, squirming.The shaksis pulled itself upward.A wooden foot found a notch in the rocks and anchored there, while the tendrilsreleased from the first hand, and it climbed higher, stretching and cracking.The insects and grubs made a simmering, humming sound that was lost in thesilent gulf of the night.Staring through scarab eyes, the shaksis ascended. It had little room forthoughts in the dried leaves that filled its head. But it held a vivid image ofNicci, of Nathan.Its targets.* * *Shouts awakened Nicci from a deep sleep, and she rolled off her pallet into afighting crouch, instantly alert and aware. Fortunately, tonight her dreams hadnot entangled with the sand panther’s mind; otherwise she might not have beenable to extricate herself quickly enough.Thistle sprang from her warm sheepskin on the floor and pulled aside the doorhanging as more shouts echoed down the corridor, which was lined with shelves ofdisorganized books. Even where the scholars slept, wall shelves were crammedwith old volumes, stacks of scrolls, folded parchments, and documents thestudents had taken out to read, but not yet reshelved.Nathan Rahl, exhausted from his studies and eager to ransack the undergroundvaults the following morning, emerged in rumpled sleeping robes. He fumbled forhis ornate sword and drew it from its scabbard, ready to fight, but he had notfound the source of the shouting. Nicci joined him.Then they saw the thing coming toward them, an inhuman soldier made of brambles,wicker, and tangled thorns. It strode forward with a crackle of limbs and anaura of buzzing noises.One unfortunate scholar emerged from his quarters just as the creature passed.Reacting to a potential target, the thing lashed out. In an instant, its armgrew long spiky thorns, and the limb curved around and impaled the youngscholar, whose mouth opened, gaping, then gasping, and finally spurting a gushof blood as the long wooden spikes found his organs. The stalking creaturetossed the dead man aside.Other horrified scholars in the halls screamed; some remained frozen in place,while others fled.Thistle clung close to Nicci. “What is that monster?”“I believe it is a shaksis,” Nathan said. “Made from the detritus of the forest,castaway items from the underbrush.”“What does it want?” cried one of the scholars, dismayed to see the bloodycorpse of his comrade still twitching on the floor.The shaksis lurched forward. The buzzing around its body grew louder.Nicci knew. “Victoria sent the thing. It wants us.”Two bright beetles nestled in the creature’s eye sockets turned toward Nicci’svoice. Seeing her, the shaksis became animated and began to run toward them downthe hall.Turning to face the attacker, Nicci pushed the orphan girl behind her, whileNathan raised his sword. The frightened scholars ducked into their alcoves.The shaksis surged closer, extending arms like wildly growing vines. Its entirebody seemed to swarm with small moving bugs and grubs. The reanimated forestcreature drove straight toward Nathan and Nicci.The wizard hacked at the shaksis with his sword, as if he were a woodcutterfelling an unruly sapling. One of the creature’s wooden arms snapped andshattered, then dropped to the stone floor. Insects and worms spilled out like aspray of bizarre, festering blood. The shaksis drew back its stump. Twigs,vines, and grasses curled around, extending outward as the limb regrew.Nathan hacked off its other arm, again wielding his sword like an axe, but thistime the shaksis regrew even faster. The severed vegetation lashed and whipped,then sprang back into place.“This will require more than a sword, Wizard.” Nicci raised a hand and releaseda blast of air that rattled into the creature, but it anchored itself, reachingout its branchy arms. It was hollow, woven of wicker, and the breezes whippedand whistled through it. More writhing bugs scuttled across the floor.“I can’t unleash my black lightning or wizard’s fire in here,” Nicci said. “Itwould destroy all of the books and the people trapped in the corridor.”The shaksis lunged forward, extending its sharp hands. Nathan swept his swordagain, letting out a loud grunt with the effort. “There’s barely room to swingmy blade.”Nicci hammered at the thing with another fist of air. The creature staggered.Books tumbled off the shelves, their pages flapping. In response, the shaksisstretched out tangled limbs and seized another scholar who tried to slip away tosafety. Vines and thorns curled around the young man, snapped his neck, thentossed his discarded body up against the wall, knocking down an entire shelf ofbooks.Struggling to control the level of destruction, Nicci called a single bolt oflightning that struck and splintered the thing’s thick left leg, rendering itunbalanced. Even though it smoked and smoldered, the tottering creature regrewitself.Nicci and Nathan stood shoulder-to-shoulder as a barricade, refusing to let thecreature past—but it did not want to pass. It wanted to kill them. With athrashing of uncontrolled branches and dry leaves, along with a buzzing ofhungry insects, it pushed back against Nicci’s blasts of air. Nathan hackedagain, splintering the encroaching branches.From behind her, Thistle said, “I’ll get a torch to light that monster on fire.”She darted away, but she didn’t get far.The shaksis reacted to her movement, and a long whip of its thorny arm extended.Even though Nicci’s magic shoved against the thing’s body core, the deadlyelongated arm seized Thistle. Sharp finger-thorns pierced the girl’s skinny legand drew blood. She kicked and fought, trying to pull away.Rage rose within Nicci. She didn’t hesitate, did not exercise caution in theconfined corridor. This monster had to be stopped. She summoned a ball offlame—normal flame, since wizard’s fire could have been catastrophic—andexploded the blaze into the shaksis.Flames immediately caught inside its torso, raging through its skeleton of bentbranches and dried vegetation. Roasting insects burst or fled. Worms squirmedout, sizzling. Even as the shaksis burned, in a surge of desperation it ploddedforward and extended its blazing arms toward Nicci. She shoved back with a blowof solid air and knocked the living inferno against the wall. Some splintered,charred pieces of the forest golem still clattered and twitched, grasping outfor any victim.The forest construct broke into flaming ashes, finally dead. But the embersscattered among the clustered books and stacked scrolls. Because of the speed ofher attack and the rush of the air she had unleashed, the volumes quickly caughtfire, their pages blackened and curled. Flames raged along the shelves,spreading from one to the next. The fabric door hangings in front of the privatequarters also ignited.Despite her bleeding leg, Thistle ran to their quarters and yanked down the doorhanging and tried to put out the spreading fire. Nathan did the same as theyyelled for more scholars to help, and they all worked together to stop theinferno.Nicci released more magic, calling upon the air again, summoning moisture todouse the larger flames. She stole air away to starve the fire until it guttereddown to a low smolder.Cliffwall scholars rushed from other chambers and corridors to aid in quenchingthe blaze before it could spread to the larger libraries and vaults of books.Seeing their murdered comrades, some of them gasped, halted in their efforts tofight the insidious fire, but others swallowed hard, faced the crisis, andturned their attention to saving the books, the scrolls, the library itself.One woman, sniffling, struggling to control her weeping, knelt by the first deadand broken scholar. She adjusted his body, his head, and began to pick up theblood-spattered books strewn on the floor from the splintered shelf.When they had the fire under control, Nicci turned her attention to Thistle andsaw that her thigh was bleeding heavily. Without asking, Nicci pressed her palmshard against the deep wound, and released magic to heal the girl and remove thepain.Thistle laughed with relief. “I knew you’d save me.”The wizard shook his head. His face was smudged with soot. He plucked asquirming beetle grub out of his white hair and crushed it between hisfingertips.Then, just after the ruckus died down, Bannon returned to Cliffwall, gasping anddisheveled, weary from an ordeal of his own. His eyes shone with excitement ashe pushed his way through the crowded corridor.“I just got back. Sweet Sea Mother, you won’t believe the night I’ve had!” Heran his hands through his bedraggled red hair, and he finally noticed thedestruction and turmoil around him for the first time. “Oh! What happened here?”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 66 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch66]The attack of the shaksis made clear Victoria’s ruthless intent. The nextmorning, with an odd smile, Nicci nodded with satisfaction. “That means she isafraid of us.”“And well she should be, my dear sorceress,” Nathan said as they worked theirway into the tunnels beneath the damaged prophecy tower. “I would feel much moreconfident, though, if we can find the hidden volume that holds the means todestroy her.”“It’s down here,” Mia said, winding them through the twisted, claustrophobictunnels.Down in the dusty vault, where the damaged ceilings were slumped and alarminglyuneven, Mia brought them to a small room where stone walls had melted likecandle wax over stacks of books. With an intent expression, the mousy researcherpointed to one thick tome fused partway into the rock. She couldn’t hide herexcitement. “This one! See the spine? It is exactly the book we’re looking for.It matches what was on the list.”Nicci touched the volume and felt its extreme age. “The pages will be difficultto read,” she said, “since it is part of the wall.”Nathan gave a futile tug, but could not break the grip of the stone. He lookedat her. “Mia has a small amount of the gift, and I would generally encourage herto practice. In fact, under normal circumstances I would just do this myself.”He frowned at the trapped book. “But because of the importance, Sorceress, andsince you are the only one with the proper control of magic, could youmanipulate the stone and release the volume for us?”“Agreed. This is not an instance where one should resort to dabbling.” Nicci ranher fingers over the binding, touched where the pages had seamlessly blendedinto the stone, and released her magic. A small flow pushed aside the rock, butdid not separate the paper and the leather-bound cover from the stone matrix.She concentrated harder, working to extricate the fused elements. “The bond isnot easily separable.”“You never shy from difficult things,” Nathan said. “You can do it.”“Yes, I can. Just not perfectly.”She moved the fundamental grains of rock and released the locked pages, but someof the fibers remained intertwined. When she finally withdrew the damaged bookfrom its rock prison, some of the pages were still stiff and powdery, as if thelast reader had been a sloppy bricklayer with mortar on his hands. Nevertheless,Nathan took the volume from her and pored over the words with an eager Mia closebeside him, under the glow of a flickering hand light.“This is it. This is the deep life spell!” Mia grinned. “Just what we werelooking for.”“Good,” Nicci said. “Now tell me how we can neutralize Victoria.”Nathan looked at her in alarm. “Dear spirits, it is not so simple as that!”“It never is. Just tell me what to do.”“This will require some study.” Nathan and Mia conferred over the damaged wordson the brittle pages. “Ah, yes, that seems clear enough.” He looked up at Nicci,explaining, “What Victoria used was a deeply bound life spell, drawn from thebones of the world. That is where Life’s Mistress receives her energy, and thatis the only way we can stop her.” He looked up. “The only way to shut off thevalve from her uncontrollable flow of magic.”Mia pulled the book closer to herself and pointed excitedly. “Some words on thebottom of the page are damaged, but the answer is clear.” She drew a quickbreath. “It’s the way we can defeat Victoria.”“I’m pleased to have a clear answer for once.” Nicci crossed her arms over herchest. “And what is the weapon?”“A special bow,” Nathan said. “Such an enemy can be destroyed with an arrow, andthe archer must be someone with a great command of the gift, a powerful wizardor sorceress.”“That would be me,” Nicci said, already anticipating the task. “And I know howto use a bow.”The wizard shook his head. “Alas, it is not so simple as that, Sorceress. Thelife spell itself is intertwined with the most ancient creatures, the verystructure of the world. The arrow must be shot from a special bow—a bow madefrom the rib bone of a dragon.”Nicci drew in a quick breath of the dusty, still air in the newly opened vault.The magical fire in her hand light flickered. “The rib of a dragon?”Nathan’s voice became troubled as the excitement faded. “Indeed. I can see howthat poses a problem.”Mia’s disappointment was clear. “Dragons are extinct.”Now that she had a potential answer, though, Nicci refused to give up hope.“Nearly extinct.”* * *The scholars gathered in one of the large meeting rooms. A fire of mesquite woodburned in the hearth, sending a warm, savory fragrance into the chamber. Nathanhad shown the ancient volume to the intent researchers, and they were all abuzzwith the possibility.“We must take action, and soon.” The wizard spoke in a firm, serious tone. “Theshaksis was only Victoria’s first foray against us. I think she meant to catchus in our sleep, but she may also have been testing us. The next attack willcertainly be more dangerous.”“And she grows stronger with every inch of territory she claims with thatmonstrous jungle,” Nicci said.Bannon sat near the hearth, sharpening his sword and brooding. His face wasgrave. “After what I saw last night, I am convinced there is no other way. Thosepoor girls…” He swallowed hard. “There was no saving them. We have to do what’sright. If we don’t stop that rampant growth, Victoria will cause as muchdestruction as the Lifedrinker.”“We have to protect Cliffwall.” Franklin sounded alarmed. “Should we block offthe other side of the plateau? Seal the window alcoves? How do we make surenothing can get in from the Scar? Like the shaksis.”“We know she is coming for us,” Mia said.Nicci nodded. “Blocking the openings would help, but only as a temporarymeasure. Once Victoria’s jungle reaches the cliffs, her vines and heavy treeroots will crack open the mesa itself. We have to stop her before then.” Sheraked her gaze over them. “I don’t care how difficult it is. We must kill her.”“And now we know how to do that,” Nathan said, “thanks to the lost volume thatdear Mia and I found.” He smiled over at the attentive female scholar. The othermemmers and scholars muttered uncertainly. Having lost both Simon and Victoria,their two factions were adrift, leaderless. “Our powerful sorceress needs toshoot Life’s Mistress with an arrow, using a bow made out of a dragon’s rib.”His voice faltered. “We only need to find a dragon.”Most dragons had been gone for many years, especially in the Old World, and thedevastating Chainfire spell had erased even the memory of dragons from humanityfor a time, but they still existed. They had to exist.Bannon let out a sad laugh. “Of course! It’s so simple. And once we find adragon, we just have to slay it and cut a rib from its carcass.” He sat downheavily on the hearth. “Sweet Sea Mother, I don’t suppose that would take morethan a day or two. What are we waiting for?”“In the last days of the war against the Imperial Order, the witch woman Sixflew on a great red dragon in her attacks on the D’Haran army,” Nicci said. “Thedragon’s name was Gregory, but he is far away now, and we would never find him.”Thistle had taken one of the large chairs, curling her knees up on the seat inan awkward but oddly flexible position. She scoffed at the young man, teasinghim like a little sister. “We don’t need to find and kill a dragon. We just needa dragon rib.”Nathan spoke in a professorial tone. “Dear child, dragon ribs come from dragons.How do you expect us to find a rib bone without finding a dragon?”Thistle gave a groan of frustration. “I mean we don’t have to find a live dragonand kill it. We just need to find a rib bone. That means we’re looking for adragon skeleton.”Bannon looked annoyed. “Sure. That’s much easier. They must be lying all overthe place.”Nicci had a sudden memory of when she and her hostage Richard had crossed theMidlands as they made their way down to Altur’Rang. On their journey they hadfound the rotting carcass of a dragon. “I’ve seen such a skeleton, but it wasfar up in the Midlands.”“Even if we could find it again, the journey alone would take months, if notyears,” Nathan said.The girl groaned again. “That isn’t where you’d look for dragon skeletons.” Shegave an exasperated sigh.“Where would you propose we look?” Bannon asked.“Kuloth Vale, of course,” she replied, as if he were the uneducated child.“Everyone knows that.”“We are not from here,” Nicci said. “What is Kuloth Vale?”“In my village I grew up hearing stories about the great graveyard of dragons.Kuloth Vale.” Thistle looked around the room, and the scholars muttered, clearlyexpressing concern. Some of them, though, seemed familiar with the tale. Amongthe memmers, Gloria nodded.“Kuloth Vale is far away,” said Mia, “a sheltered hanging valley in themountains to the north, and it’s a dangerous place. That is where the dragons goto die.”The scholars consulted among themselves. Franklin spoke with his eyes halfclosed, reciting from memory: “‘All dragons have an instinctive bond to themagical place of Kuloth Vale. The bones of hundreds of dragons lie there atrest.’” His voice became ominous. “‘No human has ever gone there and returned totell the tale.’”“Then how was the tale ever recorded?” Nathan asked.Gloria nodded gravely. “That is a mystery yet to be explained.”Nicci said, “If you know of this graveyard of dragons, then surely we can find arib bone and come back swiftly.”Though always eager for an adventure, even Bannon looked doubtful. “Sounds likechasing mist dancers on a foggy night.”But Nicci had heard all she needed to hear. “Our alternative is to wait herewhile Victoria’s jungle keeps spreading, and hope that a dragon happens to flyby so we can kill it and take a rib.”“I see. When you frame the debate in that way, Sorceress, even Kuloth Valesounds like a preferable alternative,” Nathan said.Thistle looked up at her with an intent gaze. “Kuloth Vale is real. I’ve heardstories all my life.”Bannon rolled his eyes. “You’re not even twelve years old.”Nicci turned to the gathered scholars. “You’ve been gathering maps to help us onour journey, Wizard. Have you found any that show the location of Kuloth Vale?”“If no one has ever seen the graveyard of dragons, how could they make a map?”Bannon asked.“Another unexplained mystery,” Franklin said.Nicci did not give in to frustration. She would follow this lead, knowing it wastheir best chance. “While we are gone, the rest of you must shore up thedefenses of Cliffwall in case Victoria sends more attackers against you.”Thistle slid off the chair, stretched her legs, and moved to stand by Nicci.“The journey to Kuloth Vale will take many days,” Mia said, “across unknownterrain.”“We have done that before,” Nicci said. “The sooner we leave, the sooner we willreturn. With a dragon rib.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 67 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch67]The sketchy maps from the Cliffwall archives gave them a starting point in theirsearch for the legendary graveyard of dragons, and Nicci and her companions setoff with confidence. With full packs and fresh traveling clothes, they moved upthrough isolated canyons, climbing into the desert highlands, away from thegreat valley.Full of energy, Thistle took point as they headed north toward a distant line ofrugged gray mountains that looked volcanic in origin. The air was clear and theterrain expansive, which made the distances uncertain.“Those mountains are many days away,” Nathan said, “even if we keep up a goodpace.”Nicci kept moving. “Then we should not slow.”The wizard paused to wipe his brow. He withdrew a white kerchief that Mia hadshyly given him before their departure, and he looked at it with a curioussmile. “Let’s see if that dear girl’s spell worked.” He wiped the cloth acrosshis face, then brightened. “Ah yes, moist and cool and refreshing. She promisedme it was a simple, innocuous spell, but I find it quite effective.”Nicci had been there when the quiet young scholar had given Nathan the whiterag. Mia promised that the spell would always keep the kerchief cool and moistto ease a traveler’s burden. “Simple and innocuous,” Nicci agreed. “But nomatter how gifted the scholars may be, I am reluctant to see them dabbling withany sort of magic. They are all untrained. Think of the damage they have alreadydone, unaware of what they were doing … the melted archive tower, theLifedrinker, now Victoria and her mad jungle.”“It is just a kerchief, Sorceress…” Nathan said.“And that is how it begins.”Embarrassed, he tucked it away in his pocket, but she did see him using it oftenduring the heat of the afternoon, especially in steep terrain.They walked all day, taking only brief rests for water and a quick meal. Rangingahead, Thistle killed several plump lizards to supplement their meals, notbecause they needed the food, but because she enjoyed the hunt.By the second day, they left the high desert, and the terrain grew moreforested. In the rolling hills they found brooks to refill their waterskins andeven a grove of wild plum trees. With the simple joy of finding plentiful freshfruit, they ate far too many plums, particularly Bannon. That evening, they allsuffered from stomach cramps and knotted intestines.The following day Nicci sensed an animal presence watching them, and sherealized that Mrra had trailed them up from the valley. She caught a flash oftawny fur gliding among the low trees in the distance, staying close. Stillspell-bonded with Nicci, the big cat followed wherever her sister panthertraveled, but maintained her independence.Nicci was pleased just to know of the animal’s presence. She sensed the bigcat’s need to hunt, and with a distant thrill in her veins, she felt Mrra on thechase, the pounding heart, the taste of iron-hot blood, and the squeal andtwitch of fresh prey brought down.When Nicci led them into a small meadow in late afternoon, they found a bloodydeer carcass, freshly slaughtered. Its guts were torn open and the liver hadbeen devoured, but the rest of the meat remained intact. Nathan and Bannon wereimmediately wary that the predator was still nearby, but Nicci dropped to herknees next to the deer. “Mrra hunted for us. She’s had her fill and left therest for our supper.”The wizard brightened. “Dear spirits, now that’s a different story. Let’s have agood meal.”While Nicci prepared a fire, Thistle and Bannon worked together to carve outstrips of venison to roast over the flames. The girl admitted that it tastedbetter than her lizards. After the feast, they bedded down on the soft meadowgrass, satisfied. The next morning, they wrapped some of the steaks in freshgreen leaves, and Nicci worked a simple preservative spell to keep the meat fromgoing bad. They carried the meat in their packs.Over the next several days they wound through trackless areas and ascended sheergorges that rose into more rugged terrain, but the sharp, volcanic mountainsremained very far away.“I don’t recall hearing of Kuloth Vale in my histories,” Nathan mused. Heenjoyed talking to Bannon as they walked, although the others listened as well.“But I did read many tales of the Midwar, records of when Emperor Kurganconquered the south of the continent. General Utros and his invincible armiesswept across the land, and city after city fell. He had wizard warriors, as wellas hordes of expendable soldiers.“When he set off to lay siege to the remarkable city of Ildakar, Utros knew hewould face extraordinarily powerful magic, so he needed a special weapon.”Nathan looked down at Thistle and dropped his voice into a dramatic whisper.“They captured a dragon—a silver dragon.” The girl’s eyes widened.“I’ve never heard of a silver dragon,” Bannon said. “Are they special?”“All dragons are special, my boy—and they have always been rare. Angry reddragons, aloof green dragons, wise gray dragons, evil black dragons. But,General Utros wanted a silver dragon.”“Why?” Thistle asked.“Because silver dragons are the best fighters.” Nathan waved a persistent whitebutterfly away from his face, which fluttered off to seek flowers instead. “Butthey are not easily tamed or controlled. Utros’s warriors did manage to captureone such beast, and they kept it chained and harnessed. The army intended toturn it loose once they reached Ildakar.“But one night the dragon snapped its bonds and broke free, devouring theharness and then the handlers. It could simply have flown away, but instead thedragon took vengeance. The silver monster ripped through the army camp andslaughtered hundreds of the Iron Fang’s soldiers. General Utros barely escapedwith his life, though the side of his face was burned, scarred from dragon fire.The silver dragon flew away, leaving his army a shambles, but General Utroswould never go back to Emperor Kurgan and admit failure. So he pressed on,hoping to find some other way to conquer Ildakar.”Nathan continued his story as they moved through the forest until they reachedthe crest of a hill, where they could see the towering black mountains risingcloser at last. “But when his armies arrived at Ildakar, Utros found that theentire city had vanished! One of the greatest cities in the Old World, entirelygone.”“How? Where did it go?” Thistle asked.The wizard shrugged. “No one knows. The legend is fifteen centuries old, so itcould just be a story.”“Let’s hope that Kuloth Vale is more than just a story,” Nicci said.* * *That night they slept next to a roaring campfire as the winds picked up throughthe thin trees. Nathan agreed to stand first watch while the rest of them beddeddown. Thistle curled up in her blanket, as comfortable on the hard forest flooras she had been in the stone chamber at Cliffwall, although she missed her softsheepskin.Nicci lay near the girl. Listening to the crackle of the fire with her eyesclosed, she extended her senses, but picked up no immediate danger in the nearbyforests. Her mind touched the sand panther, however, and from a distance, Mrrafelt the bond as well. The big cat affirmed that they were safe from anythreats, so Nicci let herself fall into a deep sleep.…While her body rested, her dreams ranged far, once again inside the mind of hersister panther. Mrra was more content in this sort of terrain than in either thedesolate Scar or the unsettling primeval jungle. Here, the hills felt normal,and she experienced true freedom.As the cat loped along in the night, Mrra’s mind was attuned to the world, whilealso in touch with pristine memories, which Nicci experienced. Mrra rememberedher spell-bonded troka mates, who would romp together, biting, clawing,pretending to hurt but causing no real damage.The handlers soon forced stricter, deadlier training upon them. At first, thewild sand panthers resisted, but then they learned to enjoy the fight, the kill.In her dream state, Nicci also experienced the remembered pleasure of clawingher victims, from terrified humans who offered little fight, to horrificmonsters created by the fleshmancers for the combat arena.With singing adrenaline, Mrra remembered a particular beast she and her sisterpanthers had fought in the gladiator arena before shouting crowds, spectatorswho demanded blood, demanded death—though Mrra did not understand whose bloodthey wanted. Under the guidance of the wizard commander, the fleshmancers hadaltered, manipulated, and twisted a powerful bull into a fighting beast with arack of four sharp, curved horns, a flat armored head, and steel-hard bonyhooves that struck sparks from the arena gravel. The monster bull was far moremassive than the three cats combined, but the troka had to fight it. Mrra andher sister panthers understood that.As the demon bull charged forward with an ear-shattering bellow that overwhelmedthe giddy roar of the crowd, the sand panthers had split apart, each knowingwhat her sisters were doing. Coordinating their attack, the troka circled thegiant snorting beast.The bull lumbered forward, picking up momentum, and Mrra sprang to one sidewhile her sister panthers circled and struck from behind. One raked the beast’sleft haunch, leaving parallel bloody gouges down its hide. The other cat sprangfor the demon bull’s throat, but the creature’s muscles were like corded steel,and her curved fangs could make only shallow bites.Mrra stood her ground as the monster thundered forward, too heavy and too swiftto stop. She leaped for its head, clawed at its eyes, but the bull knocked herto the ground, nearly crushing her. She felt her ribs crack. Blood burst insideof her. Pain exploded in her mind at the same time that the bull’s hot bloodpoured down upon her from the deep wounds.Through the spell bond, she experienced her two sister panthers leaping onto thebull’s back, using claws and saber teeth to tear deep wounds. With a greatbellow, the beast threw them off, striking more sparks with its enhanced hoovesas it lashed out in search of a target.Mrra rolled in the dusty sand, listened to the roaring cheers, ignoring the painof her broken ribs. This was what the handlers wanted her to do. This was whyshe and the entire troka existed. Moving as one being, the three panthersattacked again. Even though the bull charged, even though the panthers werealready injured, eventually they wore the monster down.The fleshmancers watched from the stands, scowling with displeasure to see thatthe specialized combat monster they had created could be defeated by threepanthers.Mrra and her sisters tore the twisted bull into tatters of gore. Its entrailsdangled from its stomach, but like a great senseless machine, it still lumberedand charged until it collapsed with a grunt and a spray of dark blood. Its thickpink tongue gasped out of its mouth, and the beast died with a rattling exhale.Mrra and her sisters stood together, bloody and in pain, their tails thrashing.They looked up, waiting for the handlers to come and retrieve them. Even withthe deep-seated agony from her broken bones and gashed hide, Mrra had feltcontent. The sound that bubbled from her chest was more a purr than a growl,because she had done what the handlers had trained her to do.She had killed. She had defeated the enemy.* * *During the late part of the night, while Nathan curled up near the fire and wentto sleep, Bannon took second watch. He sat on a fallen log, his sword ready,looking out for his friends and listening for any threats out in the forest.Nicci slept soundly, lost in dreams. She twitched, and a low sound came from herthroat, something like a feline growl. The sorceress was so deep in the dream,she was vulnerable. Nicci had warned them about this, and Bannon did not intendto let her down.He sat alert, guarding her until Nicci finally awoke at dawn."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 68 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch68]After days of hard travel, they finally reached the volcanic mountains. Verylittle vegetation poked through the crumbly rust-brown soil, and the boulderswere porous pumice, honeycombed with fossilized air pockets. Lichen and mossmottled the lava boulders.Standing on a high ridge, Nathan studied the crude charts from Cliffwall so hecould get his bearings. “This way. Almost there.” No one questioned hisdefinition of “almost.” He wiped his brow with Mia’s special kerchief, thentucked it away before setting off, refreshed.“I hope you’re correct,” Nicci replied. “We have been gone for too long already,and Life’s Mistress will keep growing more powerful back there in the valley.”Seeing the breathtaking sweep of the rampant growth, she had no doubt thisscourge would grow even faster than the Lifedrinker’s desolation. Yet again, shewould have to stop an enemy that would threaten Lord Rahl, the D’Haran Empire,the Old World and the New.After pushing through the untracked mountains, they finally arrived at a saddlethat overlooked a stark and secluded hanging valley. The rocky bowl below wasguarded by sharp volcanic barricades and towering rock spires, like a walled-offpreserve skirted with glaciers and broken cliffs. The black-rock basin heldpatches of snow and a partially frozen lake among the giant boulders andpinnacles of solidified ash.Nicci recognized the place instinctively, and she could feel in her heart thatthis was where they needed to be. “Kuloth Vale,” she whispered.Thistle pointed eagerly. “Look! See the bones?”Looking closer, Nicci could discern the scattered white skeletons of enormouscreatures—dozens of them, lying stark against the desolation.The sharp breezes blew Nathan’s white hair into his face. He wore a satisfiedsmile. “Dragon bones, all right,” he said, as if he were particularly familiarwith such things.Bannon craned his head upward and peered into the sky as if expecting to see theangular silhouette of a circling dragon.“We have to get down there,” Nicci said. She paused to assess the difficultroute down into the rocky valley, but Thistle set off like a mountain goat,making her way down the loose rocks. When the scree slid beneath her, she merelyhopped to a more stable boulder, and kept descending into the bleak basin.With the goal finally in sight, Nicci picked her way down the slope withoutdwelling on the spectacular scenery. Bannon and Nathan followed close behindthem, the wizard toiling with great care and the young man offering unwantedhelp. Behind them, Mrra remained at the top of the ridge, a silhouette in theafternoon light; the panther did not go farther, refusing to enter Kuloth Vale.Nicci knew the big cat would make her own choices.Among the broken black rocks at the bottom of the bowl, they came upon the firstdragon skeleton. Its rib bones had collapsed in like the legs of a dead spider.Time and weather had twisted the vertebrae. Its skull was hollow, and many ofits long fangs had fallen loose. Its empty eye sockets stared upward ateternity.Nathan went to the skeleton and tugged on a curved rib. “Should we just take thefirst one and go?” He rapped his knuckles on the hollow-sounding ivory. “Youcould fashion one of these into a bow.”Bannon looked at the wizard in disbelief. “We can’t leave yet! We have toexplore. This is the lost graveyard of dragons—think of the stories!”“We need to choose the right bone,” Nicci said. “I want to test the size andresiliency of the ribs.”They moved among the grim clutter, exploring the wealth of ribs, vertebrae, andskulls in the final resting place of the last dragons.The wizard paused beside a towering skeleton to which some shreds of scaled hidestill clung. Nicci examined the enormous skull, which was as large as an oxcart.Its long fangs were pitted, possibly rotten with age. The rib bones that curvedmajestically up from the skeleton were twice her height. Even in this faintremnant, Nicci could feel the power still resident in this great creature. Sheunderstood the closely bonded life magic throbbing within the bones. Yes, a bowmade from such a rib could hold enough power to quench Victoria’s rampant spell.“This one looks like a black dragon,” Nathan said. Each ebony scale was the sizeof his outstretched hand. “A great dragon, possibly a king among his kind.”Nicci was more pragmatic. “Perhaps so, but this rib is far too large for me touse. We need to find a more appropriate skeleton.”Moving around the upthrust volcanic rock, Bannon paused to inspect another setof collapsed bones. Nathan came up beside him, nodding. “Look there, see theslight differences in the shape of the head and the structure of the wing bones?This was a green dragon, I believe. Note the horn protrusions on its snout? Thatis how one can identify a green dragon.”Bannon frowned. “Wouldn’t you know it’s a green dragon by the color of itsscales?”“Yes, my boy—but once you are that close, then you face troubles far morepressing than scientific classification.”As they worked their way deeper into the valley, clouds scudded across the sky.They walked among the skeletons, piles of them, as if at one time there had beena great die-off of dragons.“I wonder when the last one came here.” Bannon bent down at another skull, asmall one, perhaps that of a young dragon that had perished beside its mother.Even the young dragon was larger than a draft horse.Thistle scampered ahead to explore among the rocks. She climbed out of sight asshe found more and more cluttered bones, ancient generations of fallen dragons.“Over here, Sorceress!” Nathan called. “Perhaps this one? It’s a silver dragon,based on the configuration of its skull and the bony back ridges there.Metaphorically, at least, this one might be best for fighting.”Joining him at the skeleton he had found, Nicci assessed the length andcurvature of the rib, extended her arms as if holding an imaginary bow. “A goodpossibility.”Bannon stepped up with his sword. “If that’s the one you want, Sorceress, I cancut the bone free. We’ll shape it into a bow when we get back to Cliffwall.”Thistle screamed.Nicci moved in a flash, bounding over the pitted volcanic rock and dodging thejumbled skeletons. She reached a pumice outcropping from which she could see thegirl racing away in terror. Something stirred among the rocks andbones—something enormous.A pair of angular wings unfolded, and leathery gray skin stretched taut. With ahiss, a serpentine neck scattered the rocks and heaved itself up in a spray ofdust and gravel. The piled bones clattered and tumbled away from the half-buriedform. It was a reptilian beast with wattled skin at its throat and tendrilsdrooping from fang-filled jaws. Many of its pewter-colored scales were missing,leaving exposed sections of wrinkled skin.With the sound of blacksmith’s bellows, the dragon inhaled air into its lungs,flapped its broad wings, and lifted itself up. Fire lit its golden eyes. Thecreature seemed incredibly ancient, but not at all weak.As it rose up, the gray dragon scattered debris, looming over them. Thistlecringed, directly in its line of sight. She had nowhere to run.The beast spoke with loud thunder that caused more rocks to tumble from thesteep slopes of the vale. “I am Brom!” He flapped his wings backward, making astir of wind. “I am the guardian. I am the last.” The ancient gray dragonsnorted, inhaling again to fill his withered, wrinkled hide. “And you areintruders.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 69 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch69]As Brom heaved himself up from a pile of bones and volcanic rock, Thistle backedaway, her eyes darting, searching for shelter. Throwing herself forward to facethe gray dragon, Nicci dug within herself to find magic she could use againstthe huge beast, sure the girl would be incinerated any moment.Bannon and Nathan both drew their swords and stood ready, as if they mightterrify or intimidate Brom. The wizard seemed defiant, but Bannon was clearlyawestruck and terrified.The gray dragon kept rising from the rubble of skeletons. Dust, boulders, andbones pattered off of his wrinkled hide. Smoke and sparks curled from his mouthas his jaws yawned wide. “I thought I was at my end,” Brom rumbled, “but I amstill the protector of this place.” The great wings flapped back and forth; thethin membranes were blotchy and discolored, and small rips gave the wings atattered appearance. Nicci doubted the beast could fly anymore.Brom was unspeakably ancient. Scales fell like loose coins from his hide.Summoning a roar from a bottomless pit of great weariness, the dragon bellowedat them. “Thieves! I must guard the bones of my kind.”When Nathan raised his ornate blade in challenge, he looked laughablyinsignificant. “We meant no harm to you, dragon, but we will defend ourselves.”He swept his sword high, cutting through the air. Bannon followed his mentor’slead, waving Sturdy in an attempt to scare the huge creature.The gray dragon turned his head and squinted, as if he had trouble seeing. “Youare not like other dragon slayers I have encountered. You are much punier. Easyto kill.” His serpentine throat swelled like pumping bellows as he coughed goutsof smoke, cinders, and sparks at them.Just in time, Nicci released a wave of wind that deflected the dragon’ssputtering exhalations. She reached the terrified girl and pushed Thistle awayfrom Brom. “Run—find shelter!”The gray dragon lunged toward them on unsteady limbs.Foolishly, Bannon leaped forward, and with a great yell, swung his sword down onBrom’s foreleg. Sturdy’s keen edge cut through the loose, displaced scales andthe parchment-thin hide, sinking in to the bone, as if the reptilian leg werenothing more than a fallen log.Brom let out a roar, sparking more fire from his throat. The ancient dragonthrashed his barbed tail and knocked bones and volcanic rock aside in anexplosion of anger and pain. He thrust his long neck forward, questing andsnarling, as he squinted his slitted eyes.Nicci pushed the girl along as they ran, ducking behind pumice towers and hugebones. Even a feeble, decrepit dragon was a formidable opponent. Rattling dryivory bones around her as she climbed, Thistle reached the giant skeleton ofanother black dragon just as Brom came up behind her and Nicci.The beast heaved back his long head and inhaled, building up smoke and cinders.Knowing she had to protect the girl and herself, Nicci tossed Thistle inside thepetrified dome of the black dragon’s skull and dove in beside the girl.The gray dragon’s blast of smoke and flickering fire pelted the skull, and Niccifelt the shudder of the impact, the wave of forceful wind rocking their shelter,a throb of intense heat. Thistle curled up against her, holding tight as theyweathered the attack.As soon as Brom’s blast was over, Nicci heard Nathan call out, “Fight someoneyour own size, dragon!” He let out a rude laugh. “But since no such opponent isavailable, you will have to battle us. Today, Bannon and I will become dragonslayers after all.”The young man added his shout, deliriously and foolishly brave. “Come on, oldthing—or are you too weary? Is it time for your nap?”Snorting at the insult, Brom wheeled about, sprinting away from the blackenedskull that still sheltered Nicci and the girl. With a roar that sounded morelike a trembling sigh, the gray dragon staggered after the two swordsmen. Nathanand Bannon darted about, hacking and hammering at Brom’s hind legs and tail,gouging the scales and skin. Thick, dark blood oozed out of the wounds.Brom snapped his jaws, but Nathan rolled out of the way amid a clatter oflong-dried vertebrae. Though the ancient guardian dragon seemed intimidating,many of his teeth had fallen out. Because of his titanic size, Brom toppled rockspires and struck Bannon a glancing blow, knocking him among the debris.As soon as the dragon had turned away, Nicci pressed Thistle down. “Stay here.You’re sheltered, at least for now. You’ll be safe enough.” Then she emerged toface the ancient dragon herself.“Be careful, Nicci!” Thistle called after her.Her normal magic would not be enough against even this weak and decrepitbehemoth, and she was forced to draw upon elements of both Additive andSubtractive Magic. In the gray smear of clouds that had closed over the highvalley, thunder cracked like an explosion. Nicci pulled down skittering lashesof blue-black lightning. The jagged bolts were wild and rampant. One crashedinto the curved rib cage of a sprawling skeleton, but two other branches oflightning struck Brom, ripping through the membrane of his right wing andscoring a deep black wound along his side.The old dragon let out a smoke-filled roar and thrashed his head from side toside. “No! I am the guardian.” Brom stormed toward Nicci, though he could barelysee.Nicci held both hands out in front of her, curling her fingers. She couldunleash a ball of wizard’s fire and throw it at the dragon, but she had anotheridea. Better to summon fire within the dragon, burn it from the inside out. Shecould find Brom’s heart, and explode it.In previous battles, she would summon heat and dramatically raise the internaltemperature of an object, as she had done with the giant lizards near the lairof the Lifedrinker. Now, searching with her mind, she found the dragon’s heart.She could burn it to a cinder.Facing the giant beast, she remained calm, focused. When Brom lunged, Niccireleased her magic, filling the dragon’s heart with fire. She would give theancient beast a swift and merciful death.Her magical blaze ignited Brom’s heart into a furnace—but still the dragondidn’t stop.Instead, as the fire continued to rage within him, building inside his chestcavity, Brom actually flourished, grew, swelled. Losing control of the magic shehad triggered, Nicci realized her terrible mistake.Fire would not burn a dragon’s heart to ash. Fire was intrinsic to the verybeing of such a creature. The intense heat had reignited Brom’s heart—notkilling him, but rejuvenating him, infusing the dragon with a renewed power. Histhin skin and rows of ribs became flush again. His wing membranes crackled andhealed. His enormous reptilian body grew more threatening.Fully alive again, Brom flapped his wings to create a gale of wind that knockedNicci backward. Bannon and Nathan scrambled out of the way, diving for shelteramong the volcanic boulders.The gray dragon turned his head to the sky, spread wide his jaws, and let out ariver of bright, intense fire. When Brom swung his head around, his eyes, whichhad been previously dimmed with age, blazed with a golden intensity.“Now you have made me strong enough to defeat you!”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 70 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch70]As the dragon turned its newly bright-eyed gaze toward them and let out a blastof flames, Bannon dove for shelter behind the tall pumice boulder, dragging astartled Nathan along with him. The roar of heat slammed against the pockedvolcanic surface, blackening it.While a rejuvenated Brom attacked her companions, Nicci summoned lightningagain, a blast three times as strong as her first barrage, but now the dragon’spewter scales were like thick armor, and the lightning skittered harmlessly offhis back. Full of energy, the guardian dragon coiled his leg muscles, and spranginto the air, creating a great gust with his restored wings.“This is a sacred place to dragons! You are thieves.”He vomited a wave of fire toward Nicci, and she cast out her hands, releasingmagic in a shield of air and mist that deflected the flames. But she staggeredunder the incinerating onslaught, reinforcing her barrier, straining as theavalanche of flames pounded and pounded. That one defense nearly drained her,and when the fire subsided, she staggered back.“Grave robbers!” Brom roared from the sky. “You must die.”“No!” Thistle’s voice rang out in the odd silence that filled the gap betweenthe dragon’s bellow and the blast of his flames. “Brom, listen! That’s not whywe’re here.”Nicci whirled to see that the scrawny girl had climbed on top of the giantdragon skull and now stood waving her hands to draw Brom’s attention. “We camebecause we have to!” Thistle looked tiny and vulnerable out in the open.The gray dragon swooped above the girl and curled his serpentine neck inpreparation for another fire blast.Nicci screamed, “Thistle! Take cover!”The girl looked so waifish, so brave, so impossible, that even Brom hesitated.Thistle stood on top of the curve of the monstrous blackened skull, defiant andangry. “We’re trying to save the world! My friends and I made a long journey tocome here. It’s important!”The dragon’s eyes were bright, reflecting a sharp mind now, his full facultiesreawakened with the supercharged fire that Nicci had pumped into his heart. “Youare a strange creature, tiny one,” Brom rumbled. “Very brave and very foolish.”Thistle put her hands on her narrow hips and her raggedy skirt. “I amdetermined. And I was told that gray dragons are wise.” She shot a quick glanceover to Nathan, then back to Brom. “You should listen to reason. Don’t you wantto know why we came here? Aren’t you curious?” She huffed, then answered withoutwaiting to hear a response. “An evil woman has unleashed a terrible magic thatcould swallow up the whole land. It will destroy Kuloth Vale before long … andthere’s only one way to stop it. We need a bone—a dragon’s rib.” She glared atthe gray-scaled beast. “That’s why we came here. We’ll kill you if we have to.We don’t want to, but we mean to take what we need. We are trying to save theworld.”Intrigued, Brom backflapped his wings and settled his great bulk among thegraveyard rubble, close to Thistle. Bannon and Nathan emerged from where theyhad taken shelter. Their hair was streaked with sweat, their faces smeared withsoot and dust.Nicci held the magic within her, barely restraining herself from releasinganother barrage of lightning, though she was not sure it would do any good. Shewas still weary from her previous defense and doubted she could kill or evenstun the reenergized dragon. She realized that attacking now would only putThistle in greater danger. If gray dragons were the most intelligent of thespecies, maybe Brom would listen before he lashed out again.The dragon settled back, extending his wedge-shaped head forward. Smoke curledout of his nostrils as he regarded the spunky girl. Thistle faced him withoutflinching, even though Brom’s hot breath blew back her tangled curls of hair.“Explain yourself, tiny one.”Still standing as tall as she could on top of the scorched dragon skull, Thistlesaid, “I just want to save my land. First, the Lifedrinker killed my parents, myaunt and uncle, my village, and everything in my valley—and we destroyed him.But now there’s an even worse threat, a sorceress who unleashed an explosion oflife, and now that is taking over the valley. It will destroy everything!” Hervoice became a desperate shout. “I just want a normal world. I want thebeautiful valley back, the one everyone talks about.”Brom snorted smoke. “A sorceress created too much life?” He lifted a now-healedforelimb and used an enormous claw to scratch between his tusk-sized teeth. “Imarvel at the concept. Too much life…”He turned his blazing gaze to where Nicci, Bannon, and Nathan stood ready tofight. The dragon addressed them. “I came here to die, as all dragons do atKuloth Vale … but it has been so long. I was the guardian, and I remember theirlives. Now you have restored my life.” Smoke and cinders curled from his mouthas the gray dragon let out an odd, growling chuckle. “Although I do not believeyou meant to.” He turned back to Thistle, leaning forward. The dragon’s head wasso close that she could have reached out and touched his scaled snout. “Now,brave tiny one, what does this have to do with me?”“Not with you,” Thistle said. “But with the bones … or just one bone. The onlyway we can kill the evil woman and stop that flood of life is with a bow madefrom a dragon’s rib. That’s why we came here. We mean to take one!”Nicci carefully edged her way closer to Thistle. She wanted to be in a positionto shield the girl with magic if Brom became enraged. Nicci spoke up, in a firmbut reasonable tone. “Just one rib, noble dragon. That is all we ask—and it isalso what we require.”Bannon spoke up. “There are plenty of bones here, dragon. You won’t miss one.”Brom lifted his huge head and flexed his wide leathery wings. “These are theremains of my kind. These are my ancestors.”“The spell is very specific and powerful,” Nathan explained. “We would not havecome to Kuloth Vale unless we had no choice. Gray dragons are wise, are theynot? If we don’t stop Life’s Mistress, eventually her wave of rampant growthwill cover the world, even these high mountains.”Brom simmered for a long moment, pondering deeply. “I understand that it mustseem a small thing to you, considering all these bones here, but I must reverethe remains of the dragons and do what I have sworn to do. Dragons are honorablecreatures.” He paused, regarding them one by one with his reptilian gaze. “I aman honorable creature.”Now he faced Nicci, his eyes a molten gold. “However, I must acknowledge whatyou did for me, Sorceress. You gave me life. I was about to perish and becomethe last set of bones here, and then no dragon would have guarded Kuloth Vale.But with the fire that you placed in my heart, I am alive and powerful again.You have added centuries to my life and purpose.” He huffed and seemed to relax.“Perhaps a single rib bone is not an excessive price to ask.”* * *As dusk swallowed Kuloth Vale, the gray creature watched their every move whilethe companions searched through the graveyard of dragons. Nicci assessed eachrib for its suitability. When she found exactly the right one, she ran herfingers along the smooth, ivory surface, bent it slightly, felt it spring back.Nathan studied the head, the structure of the skull. “That skeleton belonged toa blue dragon. A medium-size one. The bones look undamaged.”Brom loomed above them. A thick membrane flickered across his golden eyes, thenslid back beneath the lids. His voice was somber. “Not just any blue dragon,that was Grimney. I remember him well. We were young together, hatched only acentury apart. He was always a reckless adventurer, wanting to fly across theseas or soar off to the frozen wastes. He would play in the updrafts of themountains, taking foolish risks.” He snorted a curl of smoke. “Once, Grimneycrashed down in a thick forest and became so tangled in tree limbs that hebellowed there for days until other dragons arrived to extricate him. I helpedburn the forest to ash so Grimney could pull himself free.”Brom shook his heavy head from side to side. “Another time he flew high, highenough that he hoped to taste the fire of the sun. He came back long afterward,spiraling and flying unevenly. He was never right in the head after that.” Thegray dragon flapped his wings, then folded them neatly against his back. “Ibelieve it fitting that you use his rib for your quest. Take what you need.Grimney would approve.”Nicci assessed the rib bone one last time to convince herself that it would makethe perfect bow to kill Life’s Mistress. She used a line of magic to cut the ribfree, and the long, curved arc came loose in her hands. “Thank you, Brom.”“Now, leave this place,” said the gray dragon. “Much as I enjoy theconversation, it breaks my rules. Take Grimney’s rib and do what you must. Honorhim—give him one last adventure.”As darkness fell, they climbed up the rocky slopes to get past the wall thatbounded the valley, so they could camp outside of Kuloth Vale. When they crossedthe pass and began the rugged descent into the thickening darkness, Niccistopped and turned back to look.The gray dragon stood on the ridge, spreading his wings. Brom called after themin a loud thrumming voice. “I am the Guardian of the Vale. Do not think we arefriends. I will kill you all if you ever intrude again.”Nicci hoped they would never need to return."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 71 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch71]It was a long journey back to Cliffwall, but the terrain and the route werefamiliar to them now. During the initial trip to Kuloth Vale, Nathan hadannotated the ancient charts, marking their way and identifying landforms, andalso updating his life book.Determined to get back to the archive, Nicci pressed them to their best possiblespeed, dreading what damage Victoria had caused while they were away from theisolated canyons. Now, she had the weapon she needed to destroy Life’s Mistress.She carried Grimney’s curved rib lashed across her shoulders, and she felt thefaint tingling power intrinsic to the bone of the magnificent creature, a powerresident in life, connected to the world itself.Leaving the volcanic mountains behind and descending into the gradually openingterrain, she could sense Mrra out in the distance again, watching over them. Thesand panther had been unwilling to enter the place of dead dragons, but now shewas there to guard them, ranging ahead and scouting, keeping them safe on theway back to Cliffwall.Knowing they had no time to lose, the companions walked for many miles until theterrain was too dark to see, and even then Nicci was not ready to stop. Shewould ignite a hand light to lead their way for a few hours longer. They sleptwhen they could, and always set off into the first light of dawn.When the hills finally gave way to high desert and red-rock canyons, the cleararid air carried the hint of a miasma. Even from a distance, Nicci could see amoist greenish haze beyond the plateau, simmering with primeval forest energy asit spread across the valley toward the cliffs.Mrra left them again when they entered the network of canyons, not wanting tocome too close to people, but Nicci could still feel the big cat out there,watching. Farmers and workers from the outlying settlements in the canyon-wallalcoves welcomed them back while sending runners to report to Cliffwall. Whenthe companions reached the overarching cave grotto that held the primary archivebuildings, anxious scholars rushed out to meet them. In the late-afternoonshadows, they gathered to welcome the weary but triumphant travelers as theyclimbed the steep cliff trail.“Look, she has the dragon rib!” Gloria called, waving down at them. Beside her,Franklin was relieved. The mousy scholar Mia happily welcomed Nathan, helpinghim as he climbed up to the cave overhang, followed by Bannon. She chatteredabout the fascinating and useful books she had read in his absence, and thewizard gave her a warm, paternal pat on the back. “By the way, I used yourkerchief while we were traveling, my dear. The spell worked quite well. It wasvery refreshing and restorative.” Mia responded with a glow of pride as he heldout the perpetually cool, moist cloth to show her. “A remarkable and useful bitof magic.”Inside the archive complex, a determined Nicci led the way into the main hall,where she unslung the large rib bone and dropped it onto the first table shefound, moving aside other books that had been piled there by distractedscholars. “We can now make the weapon we need.” She ran her hand over the smoothivory surface, studying it by the light of the magical torches burning in themain entry hall. The scholars gathered around, breathless and eager to see.Nicci straightened her shoulders and explained. “This rib belonged to a bluedragon named Grimney. With this bone, I will fashion a powerful bow, and I willbe the archer to stop Victoria. We have a chance to stop a scourge that Ibelieve is even greater than the Lifedrinker.” She saw the hope in their eyes.“I just have to get ready. Ask the hunters among the canyon dwellers to bring metheir best arrows and bowstring. I will prepare everything else here.”Nathan ran his fingers through his pale hair, looking at the scholars, and Miain particular. “Did you have any troubles while we were away? Did Victoria andher wild jungle attack Cliffwall? Another shaksis?”Franklin’s words gushed out, as if he couldn’t contain them. “We erected abarricade at the outer wall of the plateau to keep us safe, just as youinstructed. For defenses, we built wooden bars and planks across the cliffopenings to block any other attacks. We tried to make this place impregnable.”“But that horrendous jungle kept spreading,” Gloria added. “It filled thevalley, and now even the foothills are exploding with life. Some of her thornvines reached as far as the plateau wall, and they’re climbing the cliffs.”“It keeps spreading and spreading,” Franklin said. “Nothing can stop it.”Mia nodded, her forehead furrowed with concern. “All those wooden barricades andbars—we didn’t think anything could break through our defenses. But whenVictoria’s magic touched them, the wood itself burst into life again! Itsprouted, then kept growing. Soon, the chamber behind the window alcove was animpenetrable thicket. We tried to cut it back, but there was nothing we coulddo. It grew too fast.”“When wood didn’t work, we used stone bricks to wall off that passage,” saidFranklin. “It is secure now, unless Victoria can find a way to make the stonecome alive.”“That’s a good solution,” Bannon said.“But only a temporary solution,” Nicci said, shaking her head. “Given time,vines and roots can break through even the strongest stone.” She stroked thecurved dragon rib, imagining how she would use it. “But I will not give Victoriathat time.”Mia came up to the wizard, holding a charred book in her hands. The pages werecurled and blackened, the cover scorched. “Nathan, I’ve wanted to show you. Wesalvaged this volume after the fire from the shaksis. I was putting the booksaway when I found a reference in here to a dragon-bone bow, so I knew it wasrelevant to the spells we need. Would you help me study them? See if we can makeout the words, even though the pages are damaged?” She lowered her head. “Ididn’t want to use my gift to restore the ink and the paper unless you were hereto help me.”“Why, I’d be delighted to supervise, my dear,” Nathan said, turning to followthe young scholar. “Do you think we could have some tea while we read? Andsomething to eat?”Gloria shouted for food and drink to be summoned for all of them. “Where is ourhospitality? These people have had a long journey! Victoria never would have—”She cut off her words in embarrassment, realizing what she had said.Though she was tired and dirty, her black dress tattered, her boots scuffed,Nicci refused to rest. “I have to get to work. I am going back to my quarters tofashion the bow we need.”“I’ll help,” Thistle said, tagging along. “Show me what to do.”Seeing the eagerness in the girl’s eyes, Nicci gestured down the corridor. “Comewith me. This requires my magic, but you can watch and be ready to help if Ithink of anything.” Thistle readily agreed and accompanied her with a jauntystep through the stone tunnels until they reached their shared room.The girl poured water into the washbasin and let Nicci refresh herself by wipinga damp rag over her face and her tired eyes. When she was done, Nicci rinsed therag and handed it to Thistle. “Now you scrub, at least enough so I can see yourface.”“You’ve seen my face.”“I’d like to see more of it. You may well be a pretty girl, but I have yet tosee complete proof.”Thistle gave her a teasing frown. “As long as you don’t make me wear a pinkdress.”“Never.”Dutifully, Thistle washed her cheeks, forehead, eyes, and nose, scrubbing hard.“Clean enough?”Nicci saw that the girl had indeed exposed some patches of clean skin, andsmeared dust around others. The water in the washbasin was brown with grit.“Clean enough for now. You can sit on your sheepskin and watch me, but quietly.I need to concentrate.”The girl acted as if Nicci had given her a solemn mission. She found acomfortable spot on the sheepskin, tucking her knees under her. When one of thearchive workers hurried in with a tray of tea, biscuits, and fruit, Thistleserved Nicci, who ate distractedly. The girl, on the other hand, devouredeverything that remained.Laying the long bone across her lap, Nicci sat on her pallet and considered howshe would fashion the bow. She ran her palm along the curve of Grimney’s rib,found the structure of the bone, and released her magic to reshape it. Shesoftened and then hardened the marrow. She felt the great power alreadycontained in the stiff, curved rib, but added even more power to it.Working carefully, cautiously, she adjusted the arc, then fashioned a recurve oneach end, added flexibility where it was needed, reinforced cracks in the bonestructure, sealed the porosity. She concentrated tirelessly, consumed with thetask.Looking up, she saw that Thistle was sound asleep, curled up on the sheepskin.Nicci watched the sleeping girl, noting the relaxed expression on her elfinface, her smooth brow now that she felt safe and at peace.Nicci knew she needed to kill Life’s Mistress, so that she could keep the girlsafe.While Thistle dozed, Nicci finished her work. She felt the rib trembling withenergy and anger, ready to complete its mission. In his life, the blue dragonGrimney had wanted excitement, had wanted to accomplish great things. Now hewould do that.Touching the new weapon, Nicci thought of how she would bring much-needed deathback to the throbbing evil of the primeval forest.* * *Leaving the other scholars behind, Mia led Nathan into a small, well-lit studyroom. She carried the burned, damaged book she had found among the volumessalvaged from the shaksis fire.Nathan took a seat and patted the bench beside him. “Now, let’s study thoserecords you found. The more we understand, the better chance Nicci has.” He knewthey could never go back to Kuloth Vale and demand another rib bone from thegray dragon if this one failed. “We’ll only have one chance.”He and Mia sat in a small alcove lit by bright candles, leaning close to studythe blackened, curled pages of the volume. “I don’t know if this is anythingsignificant,” she said as she flattened the pages and pointed out lines writtenin an eclectic dialect. “But it does mention a bow made of a dragon’s rib.”“That can’t be a coincidence. I never heard that dragon skeletons wereparticularly useful.” He touched his lips. “Though I admit they are certainlyimpressive.”The young woman frowned at the smudged writing, the scorched paper. “No onenoticed this spell before, because we were looking for a spell to block theoutpouring of life.” She gave him a faint smile. “After you left, I searched forsuch documents, and another scholar referred me to this book. He was actuallyresearching a cure for impotence.” She lowered her voice to a conspiratorialwhisper. “It took some doing to get him to admit that.”“A cure for impotence? I suppose that fits with the restoration of life,” Nathanquipped. “And is there a counter to it?”“For his purposes, he did not find the spell he needed, so he placed the bookback in the corridor shelves to be returned to the archives in the normal courseof work. As it happens, the shaksis attacked before the book could be reshelved,and it went missing. Some of these pages are damaged, but I noticed a mention ofthe dragon-rib bow, and I knew you would want to see it.” She pointed to a deepbrown spot on the paper. “Look here.”“Indeed. We already knew the power of the bones, my dear girl. It references theweapon we want?”“Yes, the bow itself and the powerful gifted person required to be the archer.But that is only part of the spell! This section, the damaged part, mentionsrequirements for the arrow as well. We didn’t have all the information before.”Nathan’s brows pulled together in a troubled frown as a chill ran down his back.“You’re certain the arrow has to be special, too? The bow doesn’t impart therequired magic? I hadn’t considered that. How discouraging. What more do we haveto do?” He squinted, but the blackened char on the edges had destroyed the ink.He knew Nicci would certainly not want to be delayed. “It’s too damaged toread.”“I can attempt to fix that,” Mia said, smiling. “I found a trick when I wasstudying the old books, but I didn’t want to try unless you were here. I’venever done it before, but I think I understand the magic involved.” She tracedher fingers along the outside of the pages, then released a tiny trickle of herown gift. To Nathan’s delight, the edges of the paper became white again, thentan. The damaged page healed and stiffened, clarifying the ends of sentencesthat had previously been obscured.Marveling at what she had done, and how easily, Nathan let out a sigh. “I forgothow many people here are gifted, even if they are untrained.” He sniffed. “AndI’m supposedly the great wizard and prophet.”“It’s a simple spell, really,” Mia said, embarrassed. “Nothing dangerous.”“Starting a fire is also simple if you have a spark. But without the spark…” Heshook his head, and focused on the newly restored writing. “Never mind. Now,what does it say?”Mia concentrated on the words she had just restored. “Hmm, the couplet onlyrefers to a ‘properly prepared arrow.’ And this section here”—she tapped with afinger—“says, ‘Only one kind of poison is appropriate.’”“Dear spirits, a poison? What kind of poison is it?” Nathan groaned, fearingthey would be faced with some other lengthy and difficult quest before theycould fight Victoria. “And where are we supposed to find it?”Mia turned the pages and they scanned the other spells, including the mosteffective cure for impotence, though they needed the opposite sort of magic tostop Victoria. “In this next line it refers back to the original spell book, andwe didn’t read all of that, either. I thought we had all the information weneeded, but some of those pages were damaged when it was fused with the stonewall.”Nathan gave her an encouraging smile. “You’ve just demonstrated your proficiencywith the new restoration spell. Maybe you can fix those pages, too?”Mia stood from her seat, ready to do whatever he asked. “Perhaps I can.”Still weary from the journey, he sipped his tea and pondered while the younglibrarian ran into the archives. She knew where to find what she was looking forand soon returned with the damaged book that Nicci had extracted from the meltedstone wall.Together, they turned the pages, assessing the smears of dust that obscured theancient writing. Using her gift, Mia held her hands over the pages, squeezed hereyes shut in deep concentration, and worked her fingers over the smearedwriting. Some of the stone powder flaked off like dried mud and lifted free intiny specks of dust, floating away to expose words that had previously beendamaged and lumped together.“I thought we had read the whole spell before,” Nathan said, “but this sectionon the next page…” He leaned closer to read what she revealed.Mia cleared away and freshened the distorted ink, pleased to use her newfoundskill. When the letters became dark and clear, Nathan read the preciseinstruction for preparing the arrow to be shot from a dragon-rib bow, an arrowthat could kill the wielder of the uncontrolled fecundity spell.It was the key to defeating Life’s Mistress, the poison that they needed toaccomplish their task.In a long, hoarse whisper, Nathan said, “Oh no.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 72 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch72]When she was finished, Nicci considered the dragon-bone bow a work of art, awork of death. The surface of the magic-infused ivory was veined with lines offaint gold that were intrinsic to the dragon itself, threads connected to theworld and life.She couldn’t wait to use it against Victoria.In the Cliffwall canyons, the isolated settlers often hunted with bows of theirown making, and the best archers had already provided sturdy bowstrings made ofwoven sheep gut. At Nicci’s request, they had also offered a selection of longarrows fletched with crow’s feathers and tipped with splayed iron heads, theirrazor edges sharpened to a bright silver edge.After she strung the graceful recurved bow, it thrummed with the energy of oneof the world’s most magnificent creatures, a dragon tied to the source of lifedeep within the earth—likely the same source of power that the Eldertree haddrawn upon. The bow vibrated in her hand, as if Grimney’s spirit was eager to bereleased for one last quest.Nicci was ready. The arrows were ready.She took her weapon and headed through the winding tunnels until she reached agathering hall for the Cliffwall scholars, deep in the heart of the plateau. Shefound Nathan already there, his face stricken, his skin ashen. Beside him, theyoung scholar Mia looked terrified.She immediately sensed something terribly wrong. Her hand tensed around the bow.“What is it, Wizard?” Nathan opened his mouth, closed it, as if he couldn’t findthe words. “Tell me.” The sharpness in her tone startled the answer out of him.“The bow isn’t enough,” Nathan said.Just then, Bannon entered the room with a jaunty step, full of energy. Thistleaccompanied him like a little sister, washed, dressed, and rested now. Bannon’seyes sparkled in anticipation of the great battle that was to come. He seemedtoo naive to be afraid. “I am ready to fight Victoria! Just like when wedestroyed the Lifedrinker together. Will I join you, Sorceress?”Nicci raised a hand so abruptly that she cut off his words as surely as if shehad released a silencing spell.Thistle’s honey-brown eyes went wide at her reaction. Bannon looked around inconfusion and saw the expression on Nathan’s face. “W-What happened? What’s thematter?”Nathan slid one of the old, damaged books across the table toward them. “A bowmade from a dragon’s rib is an extremely potent weapon, and you are indeed apowerful sorceress to wield it, but that is only part of what the magic requiresto destroy Victoria. There is more…” He slowly shook his head. “The price ismuch greater than we knew.”He opened the stained volume to the pages that Mia had restored with magic. Hetouched the words with his extended finger. “Read the ancient text yourself,Sorceress. Draw your conclusions.” His voice grew much quieter. “The words leaveno room for interpretation.”Mia stared at the lines, as if she hoped the letters would change. She slumpedheavily into a chair.Bannon stood straight and determined. “No matter the price, we have to stopVictoria,” he blurted out. “After what she did to those poor girls…”Nathan’s azure eyes bored into Nicci as he explained. “In order to kill Life’sMistress, not only must you use a bow made of dragon bone, but the arrow itselfhas to be tipped with the necessary poison—a poison that can sap all vitalityfrom life.”“What poison?” Thistle asked.Nicci looked down at the page and read the words herself even as the wizardrecited, “The loss of a loved one.” He drew a deep breath. “No matter how sharpthe arrow is, or how strong the bow might be, in order to kill Victoria, thearrowhead must be coated with the heart’s blood of someone that the archerloves, someone the archer kills. And we have already established that you mustbe the archer, Sorceress.”Bannon and Thistle both gasped, and Mia slumped in her seat, her shouldersshaking. Nicci felt deep cold rush through her as she read the spell again,grasped what it said. “This is not acceptable.”Before she could respond, a distant crack resonated through the stone-walledchamber and rumbled through the corridors. Cliffwall scholars hurried down thehall, running to investigate. An old librarian with a long white beard scuttledpast the chamber door, his eyes wide with alarm. “The outer wall! Victoria’svines are attacking the plateau defenses.”Followed by the others, Nicci bolted out of the chamber and rushed among thepanicked scholars through passageways to the outer wall of the plateau. Thistleran faster, racing ahead to where a frantic crowd tried to barricade the openingthat had been breached by writhing, murderous vegetation. Men and womenfrantically hauled crates and stone blocks from other rooms, any obstacle toblock the passage from the intrusion.Outside, thick, thorny vines from the explosive primeval jungle had climbed thecliff like an invading army. Tendrils and tentacles thrust into cracks in therock, pushing, prying, breaking open the defenses. The vines had now burstthrough the outer chambers previously sealed with stone blocks. The wooden barsthe defenders had initially mounted in place had now grown into huge writhingthickets that shoved open the temporary barricade, and the broken stone blockslay strewn in the hall. Wild vegetation spewed into the formerly imperviousarchive complex.Mia cried out in dismay when she saw the infestation of dangerous growth.Thistle dodged and danced away from the grasping vines and branches that surgedinto the corridor. A whipping tendril scratched her skin, but she slapped itaway and scuttled out of reach.Nathan had not brought his own sword, but Bannon leaped to the attack, using hisblade to hack the whipping vines and branches. One woody appendage snapped backand slammed hard against the side of his head, stunning him. The young manreeled and his knees began to buckle.Nathan rushed in to grab his protégé, and pulled him to safety before the vinescould lunge for him. Bleeding from the side of his head, Bannon groaned anddropped his sword with a metallic clatter on the stone floor. Nathan dragged himfarther out of reach so that he could check his injury.Mia, left staring appalled at the horrific growth, did not move quickly enough.Before she could dodge out of the way, a thorn-studded vine lashed around herneck, coiled, and tightened. The sharp spikes plunged into her throat, diggingthrough flesh and blood vessels. Gouts of crimson sprayed out as she screamedand struggled.Whirling, Nathan howled, “No!” He lunged toward Mia to save her, instinctivelylashing out with his hand to summon a blast of magic … but nothing happened, noteven a flicker. He was helpless.With an additional jerk and twist, the malicious vine snapped the young woman’sneck, then discarded her body against the curved wall.Nicci knocked the frightened scholars away as she pushed forward, desperate tofind something powerful enough to block this incursion. Ignoring Bannon’s groansand the wizard’s outcry of grief and fury, Nicci thought of how she hadmanipulated the fused stone down in the vaults, reshaping and moving the rock.Now she called upon the structure of the plateau walls, reshaped the stone as ifit were soft candle wax to create an impenetrable curtain across the opening theplants had broken through. Under her guidance, the re-formed slickrock floweddown and severed the writhing vines and branches, sealing off the outer wall ofthe plateau. The stone solidified, restoring the integrity of the cliff, wallingoff the incursion of deadly plants. They were safe. For now.Sobbing, Nathan had dropped to the floor, pulling the dead young scholar againsthim. Mia bled from the brutal gashes in her neck, soaking the wizard’s borrowedrobes with red, and her head lolled. He groaned. “She was so smart, so loyal.Dear spirits, if not for Mia we wouldn’t have found the other part of the spell.Otherwise, all our efforts would have failed. It’s because of her that we have achance.” He looked up at Nicci with reddened eyes. “We have a chance.”Nicci assessed the shocked and frightened scholars. She had no illusions abouthow difficult this terrible enemy would be. “We need the necessary poison forthe arrow.” But the task seemed impossible, and dread weighed heavily in the pitof her stomach. The heart’s blood of someone she loved? Her voice was cold. “ButI love no one.”It was a bleak statement, but true. Her one true love, the only man she wouldever love, was Richard Rahl. She had given him her heart with a passion that hadnow transformed, but had never waned. At first, that love had been dark—thewrong kind of love—but Nicci had an epiphany. She had grown and learned herlesson, eventually accepting that Richard would only ever love Kahlan. Those twobelonged together in a special way and could never be separated, should never beseparated.Nicci had come to that realization long ago. She still loved Richard with allher heart, but in a different way. Nicci had gone to the Old World to serve him,to explore his new empire, to lay the groundwork for a new golden age … even ifit meant she had to be far away from him.She had not believed the words Red had written, about saving the world—forRichard—but now she saw it was true. First the Lifedrinker and now mad Victoriawould have swallowed up the world, devastated the D’Haran Empire. Nicci had todo everything necessary to defeat the enemy, but in order to do so she neededthe heart’s blood of someone she loved.And it was Richard she loved. She could think of no one else.Nicci had to be the archer. No one else had the necessary power to faceVictoria. Nathan had lost control of his gift, and none of these amateurscholars and dabblers here in Cliffwall even approached Nicci’s skill. It mustbe her.But … someone she loved? Truly loved? Richard …That solution was not possible. She couldn’t save the world for Richard, if shehad to kill Richard to do so. Oh, if he knew the situation, truly understoodwhat was at stake, Nicci was sure he would immediately agree to the terms—hewould offer himself, tear open his shirt to expose his chest so that she couldtake his heart’s blood. He would willingly give Nicci what she needed, the bloodpoison that would stop Life’s Mistress.But he was on the other side of the world.And Nicci would never kill Richard, could never kill him. The very thoughtfilled her with horror. She remembered how it had destroyed her to stop hisheart, to send him to the underworld, so he could rescue Kahlan. He had beggedher, and Nicci could not refuse him.But now … Would she sacrifice the world itself, just to keep Richard alive alittle longer? It sounded foolish, but she knew she would. Her stomach knotted.Somewhere, far up in the Dark Lands, Red must be laughing.The heart’s blood of a loved one.As she listened to the moans of the gathered scholars, she knew they were allterrified, but not as despairing as Nicci was. After the difficult quest toobtain the dragon’s rib, and with her own powers as a sorceress, she hadexpected to have the weapon to kill Victoria.But it was not enough, and now the last component simply did not seemachievable. She didn’t know what to do.Nathan sat on the floor, staring at Mia’s pale, lifeless face. He stroked themousy brown hair from her forehead. “I am so sorry, my dear.” Wearing a strickenexpression, he wiped her brow with the always moist, always cool kerchief thatshe had given him before their journey to Kuloth Vale.Nicci looked down at Thistle, who was thankfully unharmed from the attack, otherthan a scratch on her leg.Suddenly Bannon stood before Nicci, still bleeding from his forehead. He restedthe point of his lackluster sword on the floor in front of him. He reached up towipe a smear of blood from his wound, obviously drawing on his courage. Heraised his chin and looked at her. “I am the one, Sorceress.” He drew a raggedbreath. “It has to be me.”He hooked his fingers in the opening of his shirt and tore it open to expose hischest. “I know you care for me. I saw how you looked at me after we fought theLifedrinker together. You praised me for how useful I was. And I have seen whatVictoria is doing … what she already did to Audrey, Laurel, and Sage.” Saddetermination filled his eyes. “If I can save the world by giving my life, thenI’ll gladly do so. Draw your knife, take my heart’s blood.” He swallowed hard.“It belongs to you anyway.” He lifted his head back and closed his eyes, as ifbracing himself for a deathblow.Taken aback, Nicci scowled. “Don’t be a fool.” She pushed him aside. “That wouldnever work. I have no time for this.”Leaving the crestfallen Bannon behind, she stalked away to the archive chambers,hoping to find a different answer, some other way in one of the spell books. Shefelt a terrible dread inside.After all Nicci had endured in her life, what if there was no one she loved?"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 73 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch73]With the full intensity of a dedicated memmer, Nicci mulled over all theknowledge she possessed, the spells she had been taught, the powers she hadstolen from the wizards she killed. There had to be another solution.Wanting to be alone as she grappled with her thoughts, she went to stand outsideunder the great overhang of the main cliff grotto. She looked across the hidden,protected canyons to the clustered dwellings in the smaller alcoves scattered upand down the opposite cliffs. All these people had lived sheltered formillennia, guarding this secret archive. They had seemed safe, untouched by theoutside world until young Victoria had accidentally brought down the camouflageshroud and revealed the great library after thousands of years.The knowledge contained in the archive was dangerous enough, Nicci knew, but farworse were those amateur would-be wizards who did not understand the powers theyfoolishly unleashed.Now, late in the afternoon, the secluded canyons felt peaceful and quiet, as ifunaware of the monstrous flood of life that approached like a destructive wavefrom the opposite side of the plateau. Nicci had to stop Victoria, who hadtransformed herself into a monster. She knew how to accomplish the task, how todefeat Life’s Mistress, but whether or not the price was too high, Nicci didn’tknow how to pay it. The answer seemed impossible.Nicci, a gifted sorceress, had the dragon-rib bow, she had arrows, and she hadthe will. She was ready to face Life’s Mistress and kill her.But she did not have the necessary poison.Nevertheless, Nicci refused to accept the impossible. She never had.Tension filled the halls of Cliffwall as the scholars tried to find some way tohelp. Nathan mourned the death of Mia, and Nicci knew he would do anything todestroy Victoria and her rampaging fecundity, but he had no magic to offer … orif he did, the wild and uncontrolled backlash might cause even more destructionthan Victoria.There had to be something else.…Lost in thoughts, Nicci stared into the brooding canyon silence, whereshepherds, farmers, and orchard tenders went about their business as they waitedfor what came next. Sheltered, peaceful, oblivious … A grim weight pressed downon her shoulders. These people all counted on her to save them, because no oneelse had the ability.Yet Nicci wasn’t sure she had the ability either—the ability to love.It seemed laughable and tragic that, for all her knowledge, for all the greatmagic she possessed—and every skill she had learned or power she hadstolen—Nicci’s great failing was a simple human emotion that any child couldproduce at will.Her eyes stung as she looked at the secret canyon where so many people had livedundisturbed for generations. She wanted to preserve this peaceful home for theinhabitants of Cliffwall—and especially for Thistle, who had already endured somuch, lost so much.As a child, Nicci had loved her father, although she had been convincedotherwise. Without understanding the depth of his devotion to his employees, hisbusiness, his future, Nicci had watched her father work in the armory. She hadobserved the workers’ respect for him, but she gave him no credit for hisskills, thanks to her mother’s corrupt influence.Her mother had made Nicci feel worthless, feeding her the debilitatingphilosophy of the Order until Nicci choked on it, all the while believing shewas being fed a fine feast. Only after Richard pulled the blindfold from hereyes and showed her how to break those lifelong chains had Nicci understood herfather’s devotion and exactly how much harm the Order had done to him, as wellas what they had stolen from her with their twisted philosophy.But Nicci’s father was long gone and the Order defeated, Jagang dead by her ownhands, and she could not make up for the past. Instead, she had to look to thefuture. Now, as part of the new task for Richard that she had taken into herheart, she could save the world from Life’s Mistress … if only she could find away to use the weapon she had.Looking nervous, the memmer Gloria emerged from the front stone gates of themain tower, waving to Nicci. “Sorceress! We’ve been looking for you.”Nicci felt a tiny spark of hope, ready to grasp at any straw. “Did you findanother solution?”Gloria’s round cheeks puffed out as she blew air through her lips. “Why, no,Sorceress. It’s just that the orphan girl asked us to look for you, says it’sextremely important.”Nicci was instantly alert. “Is Thistle all right?”“She’s waiting in your quarters to talk with you. She said it was urgent, butwouldn’t tell any of us, only that we had to find you right away.”Leaving Gloria behind, Nicci rushed back inside the main buildings, hurryingalong the corridors. She was worried about the girl. Thistle had watched hervillage collapse, fought dust people, sand panthers, and a dragon, and if sheclaimed that something was urgent …Or maybe she had remembered some detail that they could use?Thistle was waiting for her inside their quarters, sitting on the sleepingpallet, her scuffed knees drawn up against her chest. Her body was shaking. Whenshe saw Nicci, her large honey-brown eyes filled with relief, but also fear.Before Nicci could speak, the girl said, “I’ve already eaten the seeds. I knewyou would try to stop me, but now you can’t. It was the only way I could besure, so now you have to do it.”A chill like a trickle of ice sliced down Nicci’s back. She stepped forward.“What do you mean?”Thistle clutched dried petals and leaves in her hands. Nicci instantlyrecognized the shriveled plant, the distinctive violet-and-crimson flower, thecrumbled stem. The girl held it out to show her. The deathrise flower, thepoisonous bloom that Bannon had clumsily given her, not knowing its awfulpotency. As a sorceress, Nicci had kept it because she knew that such powerfultools were not to be wasted.Thistle’s eyes flashed. Even as Nicci lunged toward her, the girl shoved therest of the dried petals into her mouth.Nicci threw herself upon the girl. “Stop!”Thistle swallowed.Nicci grabbed the girl’s chin and tugged at her jaw, trying to remove anyremnants from her mouth, but Thistle kept her teeth clenched together.“Too late,” she mumbled. She was already starting to convulse.Nicci summoned her magic. Maybe she could force the girl to purge herself. Maybeshe could find some way to neutralize the deadly substance.But Nicci knew that no healing spell could cure the deathrise poison. Sheremembered Emperor Jagang’s tortures, how he had tested variations of the deadlyplant in camps that he called Places of Screaming. This was no chilling tale tobe whispered over ale in an inn. The deathrise flower was truly the worstpossible poison in existence.If Nicci could kill Jagang all over again, she would.“There is no cure,” Thistle said defiantly. “You told me so yourself.” Her mouthwas empty now. She had swallowed every bit of the deadly flower.In anger and despair, Nicci shook the girl’s narrow shoulders. “What are youthinking? Why would you do that?”“To give you no choice,” Thistle said. A vicious shudder racked her body, andher voice came out in a gasp. “To make the valley beautiful again, so everyonecan live their lives … just like I always wished for.”Nicci wrapped her arms around Thistle, as if afraid the girl would try toescape. “That was a stupid, useless gesture. It won’t help.”An image flashed through Nicci’s mind of Jagang sitting outside his tent tolisten to the prolonged agony of the test subjects after they consumed thepoison. Some took hours to die, some took days. Even the mildest dose causedeyes to hemorrhage and made blood ooze from ears and nostrils. Some victimswrithed so wildly that their convulsions cracked their spines. They screameduntil they coughed up their vocal cords in bloody strands. Their skin wouldswell, their joints burst. Some clawed off their own faces trying to escape thepain.The orphan girl shuddered in Nicci’s arms, and she began to cough. Her skin wasalready chalky, her lips bloodless. Her mournful honey-brown eyes werebloodshot.Nicci knew what was going to happen to the poor girl. “There is no cure, child.Why would you do this to yourself?”“For you,” Thistle choked out. “To give you what you need. To make the choicefor you.” She squirmed and thrashed, and Nicci tried to hold her tight to keepher still. “What you can do—is give me a quick and painless death. End that forme.” She looked up. “Take one of the arrows, pierce me through the heart, quickand clean. Before it’s too late.”“No!” Nicci called up her magic, tried to find healing spells. She sent powerinto the girl to keep her strong, but the deathrise poison raged like a wildfirethrough her body. “I can’t!”“Take my heart’s blood. You need it against Victoria.”Nicci glanced over at the razor-sharp, iron-tipped arrows she had left on thewriting desk.“If you love me, you’ll save me from what you know is coming,” Thistle said.“Kill me. Use the arrow to stab me through the heart.”“No!”The girl continued in a hoarse voice. “You’ll have the blood you need. Thenecessary poison.” As she began convulsing, her small hands clutched Nicci’sblack dress. “Stop Victoria and save my land.”Nicci was torn, her heart broken. She held the orphan girl, felt her spasms growworse. She knew the pain was only the start of what would be long hours,possibly even days as Thistle slowly tore herself apart, screaming the wholetime.“I know you love me,” Thistle murmured, lifting a trembling hand to touchNicci’s cheek just for a moment.“No…” Nicci whispered, and she wasn’t sure the girl even heard her.Thistle coughed and shuddered, pressing her face against Nicci.Not wanting to release her hold on the dying girl, Nicci extended her other handand reached out with magic to pull one of the arrows from its resting place. Itslid through the air, across the room, and landed in Nicci’s palm. She wrappedher fingers around the shaft, saw the silver sheen of the sharpened edge, thepointed tip.Thistle could no longer hold back her pain. She convulsed and cried out.Nicci squeezed her tight, knowing the agony would only grow worse. She held thearrow in her right hand, turning Thistle just slightly with her left arm,finding a vulnerable place in the girl’s chest. As tears came to Nicci’s deepblue eyes, she drove the arrow forward, taking away the pain as gently as shecould.And when she pulled the arrow out, its tip and the end of its shaft were redwith a thick layer of blood from Thistle’s heart. The necessary poison.Nicci bowed her head and unwittingly added even more poison to the bloodyarrow—a single tear. The first tear that Nicci had shed in a long time."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 74 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch74]As she stalked through Cliffwall preparing to kill Life’s Mistress, Nicci feltlike a black shadow filled with razors. Hollow inside, her heart a bottomlesspit like what she had seen at the center of the Scar, she clutched the bloodyarrow, its sharp tip not at all blunted by the sticky coating. The necessarypoison was based on dangerous love, a love that Nicci had never admittedexisted.Now her heart was just a hot wound.The spunky orphan girl had surrendered her very life, had forced Nicci to dosuch a terrible thing in order to achieve the victory they all needed. Thistlehad seen something in Nicci’s heart that the sorceress did not even know shehad. She squeezed the arrow tighter, but she forced her muscles to relax, sothat her anger would not snap the shaft. She dared not waste this weapon she hadacquired at a great, impossible price.Thistle’s blood.Her normal reaction would have been to deny such feelings, to burn them away orwall them off, but she needed that emotion now because love was the vitalcomponent. Love was the poison. In this case, as Victoria would soon discover,love was deadly.As she prepared to make her way out into the primeval jungle, Nicci saw that shehad stained her black dress with the innocent girl’s blood. More poison.She paid no attention to other tense, frightened scholars who huddled inCliffwall, looking at her as a savior to stop Life’s Mistress. Poor Thistle hadalready paid the price.Victoria would pay a higher one.Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.Bannon met her in the wide hallway, dressed in fresh traveling clothes andcarrying his unimpressive sword. His face looked drawn and pale. “I am ready togo with you, Sorceress.”Nathan stood beside him, haggard and distraught, but he had a fire in his azureeyes. “Even if I can’t use my magic, Bannon and I are deadly fighters. You knowit. We’re going with you.”The young man swallowed hard. “Thistle made it possible. We should all do ittogether.”She looked at them for a long, silent moment, then shook her head. “No, I goalone. This is my battle. Thistle did her part. Now I will do mine.” Niccididn’t dare need them. She slung the dragon-bone bow over her shoulder, andcarried her one blood-tipped arrow. She did not bring spares. This one would bedeadly enough. It had to be. “I have everything I need.”After a long, solemn moment, Nathan seemed to understand. He reached out toclasp Bannon’s shoulder before the young man could say anything else. “It’s notabout us, my boy. You’ve proved yourself over and over. The sorceress needs todo this alone.”Bannon looked helplessly at his sword, as if it had become useless in his hands.When he glanced up and met her eyes, his expression froze at what he saw on herface. He stepped back, swallowing hard. “Our hearts go with you, Sorceress. Iknow you will succeed.”Nathan drew in a deep breath, let it out slowly. “Nicci herself is the deadliestof weapons.”Traveling through the tunnels, she reached the wall on the far side of theplateau. She had remolded the rock to seal Cliffwall’s defenses against theintrusion of the madly growing jungle, but even stone walls could not stop her.Releasing her magic, she shifted the slickrock and shoved it out of her way likesoft clay, opening the wall to the outside.She looked out upon a primeval disaster, an encroaching wall of twisted,thrashing greenery, tangled vines, fungi that grew as tall as houses beforeexploding into a blizzard of spores. Thunderheads of gnats and flies buzzedaround the fetid forest. In order to solve an extreme problem, Victoria hadunleashed an even more extreme solution.Branches stretched out, vines writhed, ferns uncoiled. A haze of pollen andspores thickened the air into a choking miasma. The rustle, crackle, and hiss ofall that growth battering against the mesa cliff sounded like an unstoppablearmy of life. Too much life.But Nicci was Death’s Mistress.“Make way,” she said. She held out both hands and released her magic in athunderclap of devastation, clearing the path. Wizard’s fire rolled out,unquenchable, unstoppable, and the flames charred the grasping branches andthorny vines into ash. Under the onslaught of heat, massive tree trunks explodedand the storm of splinters shredded adjacent monstrous plants.Once she had blasted a path, Nicci stepped out into the wreckage and made herway across blackened ground, descending the steep slope. In only moments, thescorched earth already stirred and simmered with new shoots bursting forth.Grass blades and vine tendrils whipped up to grasp at Nicci’s feet, trying tohold her back or take her prisoner. She sent a thought toward them, the meresttaste of vengeful anger, and the new growth shriveled and died.Then she went hunting.Victoria would not hide from her. The memmer sorceress, swollen with lushfertility, wanted to kill Nicci. She had already sent the shaksis to attackthem, and now Nicci would go to the heart of this primeval jungle. She knew whatlurked there.She adjusted the dragon-bone bow on her shoulders and walked forward, her blueeyes focused ahead. Dead things crunched under her boots. The writhing junglereached out to seize her with clawlike branches and lashing fronds. Niccisummoned the winds, bringing great raging storms of air that blasted thevegetation, snapped trees, stripped leaves off of branches, exploded mushrooms,uprooted ferns. She tore open a path to insure that her progress would beunhindered. Nicci was the eye of a walking storm.The distance did not matter. She knew her destination, her target.Expending so much magic should have weakened Nicci, but the anger and hurtinside her were a rejuvenating force. When she had cleared the way far ahead,she stopped the winds and continued deeper into the mad infestation of life. Theplants themselves seemed cowed after what she had inflicted upon them.In that momentary respite, the insects came, a cloud of black, biting gnats, aswarm of stinging wasps, and a thundercloud of dark beetles, tens of thousandsof them.Nicci spared them barely a glance. As the swarms descended upon her, swirling inthe air, she released a thought. She did not even need to gesture with her handsas she stopped tens of thousands of minuscule insect hearts. Gnats, wasps, andbeetles fell to the ground like a pattering black rain.Nicci stepped forward, and the jungle fell into a hush. But she knew she wasn’tfinished. She had not yet won.Ahead of her, branches and leaves stirred, and three figures emerged, figuresthat had once been lovely young women. Audrey, Laurel, and Sage. Now they hadbeen possessed and transformed by the forest. Their skin was the mottled greenof mixed leaves, their eyes fractured and glinting with many shades of emerald,their mouths filled with sharp white fangs. Their hair was a stir of moss abouttheir heads.The women closed in to stand in front of Nicci and block her way. She regardedthem with a withering stare. “Victoria sent you to stop me? She fears to face meherself?”The thing that had been Laurel chuckled. “It is not because she fears you. It’sbecause she rewards us.”When the forest women spread their arms, long thorns sprouted from their skin.Glistening sap oozed from the thorn tips as if they had become scorpion tails.“This is a chance for us to test our powers,” said Sage.“And we’ll have fun,” Audrey said.Nicci did not touch her dragon-bone bow, leaving her single poisoned arrow inits quiver as the deadly forest women approached. “I don’t have time to play,”she said.She unleashed the still-seething magic inside her, manifesting three writhingspheres of wizard’s fire. They rolled forward like miniature suns. Audrey,Laurel, and Sage had time only to reel backward and throw out their hands indesperate defensive spasms before the trio of suns exploded, one for each ofthem. Unstoppable flames engulfed their green-infested bodies, closing tight,crushing the inhuman women with incinerating fire. The female figures crumbledto ash that smelled more like burning wood than burning flesh.“Death is stronger than life,” Nicci said.She stepped over the ashes of their bones and made her way to the heart of theforest."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 75 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch75]The jungle stopped fighting back, as if it had accepted its own doom, andinstead the writhing, simmering forest welcomed her, lured her ahead. Trees bentout of the way, and vines curled aside to clear a path for her. Weeds and spikyshrubs bowed down before Nicci. She walked forward, dressed in black, her blondhair flowing behind her.She knew Victoria had not surrendered. The open way before her was a greentunnel surrounded by drooping ferns and low, twitching willows. It reminded herof a spiderweb … a trap. Nicci’s lips curved in a thin smile. Yes, it was atrap—but it was her trap, and Victoria would learn the truth soon enough.The terrain that had been the Scar was unrecognizable, but after a long journeyshe realized she had reached the center. Twisted obsidian pillars and brokenblack rock had once risen up from the Lifedrinker’s lair here, but now Nicci sawa glade of lush, suffocating green. Trees stretched high overhead, their boughsarching inward like hands clasped in prayer—a prayer directed toward the viciousgreen thing that grew at the center of the glade.Victoria was no longer the matronly woman who had instructed the memmers, amentor who took young acolytes under her wing and taught them everything sheknew. Victoria was no longer human. She still possessed the knowledge, thetangled spells, the lore that filled all the magic preserved by generations ofmemory-enhanced people, but she had become something so much more.The skin of Victoria’s naked body was encrusted with a lumpy excrescence ofbark. Her legs had planted into the ground, taking root as twin trunks, twistingand coiling with bright green vines gathered into a burgeoning nest of growthwhere the two legs fused into a single torso-trunk with rounded wooden breasts.Victoria’s arms stretched out as thick curved boughs, her fingers a myriad ofbranches. Her hair spread outward in a panoply of twigs, a thicket of tangledbrush. But Victoria’s face was still recognizable, if awful, her skin not justwood but suffused with green. Pulsing lines of dark sap ran up her cheeks andalong her ears.Seeing Nicci, Life’s Mistress preened like a bird displaying its feathers.Victoria drew strength, pulling energy from the ground where her roots hadspread throughout the primeval jungle, where the growth had built up enormousspell-forms to enhance and reinforce the magic. Her mouth opened in a loud,sharp-edged laugh.Neither showing nor feeling fear, Nicci stepped into the glade, paying no heedto the rustle and whisper of angry branches, of slithering undergrowth. Herenemy was here. Victoria had sent the three forest women to block her, but nowshe would face Nicci herself.Nicci stopped in front of Life’s Mistress and planted her boots in the softforest loam. Her black dress clung to her with perspiration, and Nicci touchedthe drying bloodstain on the fabric. Thistle’s blood. A reminder.She spoke in a haughty challenge. “For a woman who wanted to restore life andmake the land thrive, you have caused far too much pain and destruction,Victoria.”As her huge trunk body writhed, the layers of thick bark cracked. A bellow cameout of the forest woman’s mouth. “I am Life’s Mistress!”Nicci was unimpressed. “And I cannot let you live.”She unslung the ivory bow from her shoulder and calmly, without taking her eyesfrom Victoria’s monstrous face, bent the curved rib of Grimney, the blue dragon.The bone thrummed with energy, the magic of the earth, the source of creation.The string itself came from the people of Cliffwall, and although it had nomagic, it did have the power of human creation, stretched taut, ready for whatthe weapon had to do. Ready to use life to destroy life.Victoria’s laughter stirred the crouching trees and angry underbrush. “Oneinsignificant sorceress? One bow? One arrow?”“It will be sufficient,” Nicci said. “We found the spell, a magic that drawsupon the very power of life. A bone of creation … the bone of a dragon.” Sheheld the bow, grasped the tense string, and felt Grimney’s rib vibrate.“The bones of the earth,” Victoria said, her boughs creaking, her body bending.“The magic inside a dragon’s rib?” Her face folded and shifted, as if her mindsorted through all the ancient knowledge of thousands upon thousands of arcanetomes that she and many generations before her had memorized.Nicci pulled out the arrow, looked at its sharp end and the thick red coating,still sticky. Her throat had gone dry. “And I have an arrow tipped with thenecessary poison. The heart’s blood of one that I loved, one that I killed.” Sheknocked it on the string. “Thistle’s blood.”Victoria suddenly jerked back as Nicci provided the last clue. In her vastmental library of ancient lore, the other woman recalled the spell. One of hertrunklike legs ripped itself out of the ground. The boughs whipped, branchescracked.Nicci did not flinch. “You remember. I wanted you to remember. Thistle deservesthat.”A desperate Victoria rallied the primeval jungle to attack. The forest closedin, the ferns, vines, and wildly growing trees lunging toward Nicci. Thorns,branches, stinging insects swept to the attack, rushing in a desperate lastattempt to stop her.But Nicci had only one thing left to do. She drew back the string of thedragon-bone bow and aligned the arrow. She aimed its blood-dipped point directlybetween the large rounded growths of Victoria’s breasts.As branches, vines, and thorns thundered down upon her, Nicci loosed the arrow.She didn’t need to use magic to guide the shaft as it flew. The air whistled andsang like a last keening cry, and the razor-sharp point struck home with a loudthump. Poisoned with an innocent girl’s blood, the arrow sank into the flesh ofthe transformed woman.In Nicci’s hands, unable to bear the tension of the bowstring, the dragon’s ribsnapped in half. It had released its magic, the last energy, the final gift ofthe blue dragon who had sought adventure in his life long ago. As the attackingjungle froze and quivered, Nicci dropped the now-useless weapon to the ground.It had served its purpose.The Victoria thing howled with screams so loud that her mouth cracked open. Herhead splintered; her branch-limbs writhed in pain, broke, and fell like deadwood to the floor of the glade.Death spread outward from the center of the arrowhead like a blight of revenge,reclaiming the life that Victoria had stolen. The necessary poison had swiftlypenetrated her heart, and the green sorceress crumbled. The bark cracked andfestered. Smoking sap-blood oozed out of the wound, spilling in thick, stinkinggouts down her rough body.Victoria had uprooted one of her thick legs, but now the rooted leg shatteredlike a tree felled in a windstorm. She toppled in a long, slow collapse as herbranches tangled in the encroaching trees. Vines whipped up as if to cushion herfall, but instead turned brown and withered.Around the glade, the supercharged jungle that had swarmed across the openterrain began to shrivel. Trees collapsed, rotted, fell apart. All the extralife—the enforced growth and tortured fecundity that never should haveexisted—dissolved.Nicci turned away. The corpse of Life’s Mistress had already rotted into mulch,returning to the soil. The balance of magic would be restored and the unnaturalforest would die back to its former levels, its natural levels.Nicci had accomplished what she needed to. She had completed her mission, andshe had paid the price. There was no reason for her to stay any longer.She strode back toward Cliffwall as the seething jungle collapsed around her.She didn’t give it a second thought."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 76 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch76]By the time Nicci returned to the steep uplift at the edge of the plateau, theunnatural jungle had already begun to retreat, a mere shadow of itself—a properlevel of vegetation that did not strain the very foundations of life itself.She felt no joy over her victory, Thistle’s victory. Nicci had done what wasrequired. Her duty was discharged. She had paid the cost in blood and unexpectedlove.She was done.As the once-burgeoning trees sloughed into rotting vegetation, she saw a dart ofmovement ahead of her, a tawny shape. Mrra came to join her. Gliding out of thefalling trees and collapsing ferns, the sand panther paced alongside, not closeenough for Nicci to touch her fur, but she was there, and that was whatmattered. Nicci drew strength from their spell bond, and the big cat seemed toneed reassurance as well.When the two reached the sheer mesa wall, Nicci saw that the steep slope hadbroken and eroded away. The gnarled brown strands of dead vines still clung tothe rocks, but Nicci found a way up to the alcoves and the tunnels high above.At the base of the cliff, Mrra let out a low growl, a temporary farewell, andloped off into the foothills. She would be back.Nicci climbed back up the steep wall, using magic when necessary to move asidecrumbling blocks that the aggressive vegetation had broken away from the cliff.Nathan and Bannon met her as soon as she reentered the tunnels. Crowds frominside Cliffwall also came, excited and amazed. While watching from the alcovewindows, they had seen the festering jungle die away.“We must have a celebration!” someone called.Nicci didn’t see who spoke, didn’t even bother to turn in the direction of thevoice. “Celebrate among yourselves,” she said gruffly. “Do not make me a hero.”Life’s Mistress was dead, the enemy vanquished, the blight of twisted life nowdisappearing. Yes, there was good reason to cheer, but Nicci did not feel likerejoicing. Rather, she found a hard core inside her and held on to that.She would never be Death’s Mistress again. She had left that dark part of herlife in the past, and she had promised Richard. She had learned from theterrible things she’d done for Emperor Jagang. Though Thistle’s blood hadprovided the necessary poison to destroy Life’s Mistress, Nicci herself did notwant to be that vulnerable.Never again. She had saved the world, and that was enough. Even if Thistle couldnever see it, the girl would have her beautiful valley back.The Cliffwall scholars were unsettled by Nicci’s response, and Nathan looked ather with a concerned expression. He gave her a slow nod, then lowered his voice.“You don’t need to dance and sing, Sorceress, but you did defeat Victoria andstop that terrible threat. You can feel satisfied.”She looked at him for a long moment and then said, “I would rather not allowmyself to feel anything at all.”* * *At Nicci’s suggestion, although it was obvious to anyone who considered it, theyburied the girl out on the edge of the valley where the fresh vegetation, thehealthy shrubs and plants, had begun to grow again.It was a somber procession as they wrapped Thistle’s small body in the softsheepskin rug she had loved so much when she slept on the floor in Nicci’squarters. Nicci carried the body herself, and although her heart was heavy as astone, the girl seemed to weigh almost nothing.Franklin, Gloria, and many of the other remaining memmers and scholars leftCliffwall, emerging along the steep side of the plateau. They walked until theyreached a spot just on the foothills overlooking the valley, which Thistle hadso longed to see fertile again.Nicci halted. “This is the place. This the view Thistle would want. From here,she would have been able to see the restoration of life that she made possible.”As hot tears stung her eyes, Nicci caught a glimpse of Bannon and Nathan, theirfaces also flooded with grief. Bannon’s hazel eyes welled with unshed tears, andeven Nathan, who had seen so much sadness and lost so many people during hiscenturies of life, was deeply affected by the loss of this one spunky anddetermined little girl.“Her spirit can tell the Creator how she would like the valley to be,” Nathansaid. “I’m sure she will make herself heard.”Bannon nodded. “Thistle could be very convincing.” His voice cracked.Nicci could only nod. She felt so full of words, emotions, and ideas that shewanted to express, but they only simmered within her. Thistle would know. Thatwas all Nicci cared about.With a gesture from her hand, she released a flow of magic that moved the dirtand rocks on the chosen patch of ground. As she had done at the village of RendaBay, Nicci created a grave, carving out a perfect, comfortable last bed toembrace Thistle’s remains.As the scholars watched solemnly, Nicci laid the girl wrapped in the sheepskininto the open grave. “This is as far as you can go with us,” Nicci said. “I knowyou wanted to travel to see all the new lands we intend to explore, but fromhere you can watch the valley. I hope it becomes all you ever wanted to see.”Her arms and shoulders felt stiff, and it was because she had forced such tightcontrol on her muscles to keep herself from trembling. Nicci drew a deep breath.She, Bannon, and Nathan looked down at the wrapped form in the grave. With agesture, Nicci brought the soft loamy dirt back into place, filling itperfectly, leaving an open patch of naked brown earth on top.“Should we mark the grave somehow?” Gloria asked. “Is there a stone or a woodenpost you’d like us to use?”Nicci thought of what Thistle had said, how she had laughed at the frivolous butwondrous thought. The girl had grown up without seeing anything of naturalbeauty, watching her aunt and uncle eke out a living in Verdun Springs, tryingto grow stunted plants for food.“Flowers,” Nicci said. “Plant beautiful flowers. That’s what Thistle would wantto mark her grave.”* * *Before she and her companions departed again, Nicci called a gathering insideCliffwall, speaking to the workers, farmers, and canyon dwellers as well as thememmers and scholars. In a stern voice, she said, “We have only been here for afew weeks, but already we have saved the world—twice! Both times the disasterswere caused by your own clumsy ignorance. And, oh, the consequences … the pricethat had to be paid.”She swept her blue-eyed gaze over the gifted researchers, and they trembled withguilt and shame.She continued, “You are untrained. Thousands of years ago, your people wereentrusted to guard this storehouse of knowledge. Dangerous knowledge. Do notconsider it a library, but an armory—all the books and scrolls here are weapons,and you have seen how easily they can be misused.”“With disastrous results,” Nathan said. “For all my objections to the Sistersand their iron collars, at least they devoted themselves to training new wizardsback at the Palace of the Prophets. With the lore stored here, you cannot justwilly-nilly dabble with spells as if they were toys.”Franklin hung his head. “Perhaps we should devote ourselves only to the work ofcataloging, exactly as Simon wanted us to do. That is enough to keep us busy fordecades.”Gloria wiped a small tear from the side of her eye. “The memmers can help tomatch what we know with the volumes we find on the shelves.” She drew a deepbreath, let it out slowly. “But who will teach us?” She looked hopefully atNicci and Nathan. “Will you stay?”Nicci shook her head. “We will depart soon. I have my own mission for Lord Rahl,and the wizard has an important destination.” She spoke in a tone of command,the same tone she had used to send tens of thousands of Emperor Jagang’ssoldiers off to certain death. “But after we go, you must do one thing for me.An important task.”Franklin spread his hands, then gave a respectful bow. “Of course, Sorceress.Cliffwall is in your debt.”“Send emissaries north to D’Hara and tell Lord Rahl about this archive, andabout what we have done here. That is knowledge he needs. Once he learns what ishere, he will send his own wizards, scholars, experts. They will help you.”“I’m sure Verna would delight in the challenge,” Nathan said. “Dear spirits,imagine what the Prelate would do with so much unexplored lore! She needssomething to do, now that prophecy is gone. She could bring many Sisters withher.” He nodded slowly. “Yes, indeed, you would be in good hands.” He narrowedhis eyes and added in a scolding tone, “But in the meantime, no more dabblingwith spells.”Gloria agreed. “We will put in checks and balances to insure that no disasterlike Roland or Victoria ever happens again.”One of the scholars fidgeted, looking at the rest of the uneasy audience. “Buthow will we find D’Hara?” He was a thin and rabbity young man named Oliver whohad a habit of squinting, as if his eyesight had already waned from too muchreading by dim candlelight. “I will volunteer to go, to accept the quest … solong as I know where I’m going.”Nicci had little patience for the details. “Follow the old imperial roads. Headnorth. Make your way beyond the Phantom Coast to the main port cities of the OldWorld. Ask about the Lord Rahl.”“That will be an arduous expedition, Oliver.” Franklin sounded uncertain.“Yes, it will be,” Nicci said. “And we require it of you. Sometimes you must dothings even though they are hard.”“I will go with Oliver,” said a thin young memmer woman, Peretta, with tightringlets of dark hair. “Not only is it an important mission, but every personhere in Cliffwall, whether memmer or traditional scholar, has a mission togather knowledge. And what could be a better way to seek knowledge than toexplore the rest of the world?” She blinked her large brown eyes.Oliver smiled and nodded at her. “I will be happy to have you.”“You’ll both learn much. You’ll be great explorers.” Nathan patted the leatherpouch at his side, which still carried his life book. “I will also wantCliffwall scholars to copy the maps I’ve drawn along the way, and take a summaryof our expedition so far. The people of D’Hara need to know everything they canof the Old World.”Franklin looked at the memmers, then at the rest of the scholars, and he gave aconfident nod. “Do you think you can do this, Oliver and Peretta? Will you beambitious enough to undertake this quest?”Like a slowly exhaled breath, the audience began nodding and talking. Perettasniffed. “Of course we will.”Ready to go, Nathan had dressed in fine travel clothes again, his ornatescabbard belted at his waist, his brown cape from Renda Bay, a dark vest andruffled shirt taken from Cliffwall stores. “After years of reading dusty oldlegends, some of you must want to become adventurers yourselves.” He laughed.“When you return from D’Hara, you will have earned your own place in history.”* * *Before her unexpected death, Mia had found for Nathan an old chart that clearlyshowed a place marked Kol Adair on the far eastern side of the great valley,over several lines of stark mountains.Looking at the ancient map, Nathan was concerned at the prospect of crossingover such sheer and jagged crags. “Maybe it won’t be so bad. The cartographercould have exaggerated the extremity of the terrain.”“We will know when we get there,” Nicci said.“And we know where we need to go,” Bannon added.The two men bade farewell to the people of Cliffwall, but Nicci said nogood-byes; she simply set off, descending the path to the valley floor. Theyheaded eastward into the now-recovering terrain at a brisk pace. Nicci sensedMrra following them from a distance, and she acknowledged the sand panther’spresence through their tenuous bond.They headed into the unknown."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 77 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch77]Leaving Cliffwall behind them, they crossed the wide, wounded valley for daysbefore reaching the eastern foothills. The hills rose toward distant and farmore rugged mountains that looked like the ridges on a dragon’s spine.As they traveled, they found the remnants of old roads that had been all buterased by the life-absorbing Roland and by Victoria’s raging fecundity. Theycrossed terrain where once-thriving towns had been emptied and swallowed up.Now, the uninhabited wilderness was breathtaking in its sheer, empty silence.Although Nicci didn’t feel like engaging in conversation, the silence andconstant walking gave her too much time for internal reflection. There wasn’t amoment when she did not feel the loss of Thistle, but she tried to build up herinner walls and harden the scar. She had lost many people before, others shecared about, especially in the recent battles with Emperor Sulachan and hisbloodthirsty, soulless hordes. Cara … Zedd …Nicci had killed countless people herself. She was familiar with death,untroubled by blood on her hands. Her conscience was not heavy. She tried toconvince herself that the orphan girl was just another death.Just another death …Topping a sparsely wooded ridge, Nicci, Bannon, and Nathan turned to look behindthem. The vast valley now showed patches of healthy green growth and the flowingsilver ribbons of streams. But it was neither a madness of life, nor a crackeddesolation of death.Nathan drew a satisfied breath. “You see? That is what we did, Sorceress.”“It is what we set out to do. Now I’m done with the witch woman’s prediction.”Nicci turned and continued into the hills before she could think about the pricethey had paid for that achievement.“Ah, but Sorceress, on such a journey as ours, is one ever truly done withsaving the world?”When they made camp that night, Mrra dragged a mountain-goat carcass into themeadow and dropped it there for their dinner. The sand panther had already fed,and she sat on the fringes of the clearing, watching Bannon cut fresh meat whileNathan built a campfire. “I want to prove I can do this without magic, thoughthe process is certainly a lot less convenient.” He sighed. “Soon, though, Iwill be whole again.”They contoured along streams through the hills, picking the best path that wouldkeep them moving into the rising mountains. Since Bannon had grown up on anisland and sailed the ocean, he had little instinct for finding a route throughhilly terrain. Nicci led the way.She scanned the rugged landscape and picked a switchbacked path up the slopes,across open parks, then into thick pine forests. As they gained altitude, thetrees became sparser, then stunted. After thrashing through thickets ofknee-high alpine willows, the three emerged into open windswept tundra withwhistling grasses and low cushions of wildflowers. Mrra bounded on the rocks,ranging ahead to chase waddling marmots.Bannon was out of breath, panting hard. He bent over, resting his palms on hisknees. “The trail is steep, and the air is thin.”Nathan did not commiserate. “I am a thousand years old, my boy, and I’m keepingup with you. Come, Kol Adair is ahead.”“The air will grow thinner still,” said Nicci. “Our destination is much higher.”Bannon squinted as the wind whipped his ginger hair like crackling flames aroundhis head. “When I grew up on Chiriya, I never imagined this.” He looked incurious amazement at the rugged lichen-covered rocks as they picked their waytoward a steep pass ahead. “I’ve come so far from that place and from that life,not just in the miles I’ve traveled but in the things we’ve seen and done.” Hegave his mentor a wan smile. “All the things you’ve taught me and all theexperiences I’ve had, Nathan. Maybe this isn’t the perfect life that I dreamedabout, but I am happy with it.”He turned to Nicci, pressing her for a response. “Do you think I’ll ever see theD’Haran Empire for myself? You’ve told stories about those lands. Could I evenmeet Lord Rahl someday?”“D’Hara is a long way from here,” Nicci said, pushing toward the top of thesteep ridge ahead. “And we are heading in a different direction.”Nathan was more encouraging. “Maybe you’ll see it someday, my boy, but why be ina hurry? This world has many lands, many people, and many sights to see.” Hesmiled and quoted what Red had shown him in the life book: “Future and Fatedepend on both the journey and the destination.”Because the slope was so steep, they stopped to catch their breath beforereaching the summit of the pass. Nathan took out the Cliffwall charts, studiedthem again, and looked back at the mountains they had just crossed. “We shouldbe close to our destination,” he said. “Very close.”When Nicci set off again, her gaze fixed ahead, Bannon and Nathan hurried afterher. Mrra ranged among the rocks, frustrated that the fat, furry marmots alwaysmanaged to duck into shelter before the cat could catch them. Then one of theanimals let out a high-pitched squeal as Mrra killed it for a snack.The ground was hard and packed under Nicci’s boots while she worked her way upto the pass, leading the way, steeper and steeper. Finally, when she climbed herlast steps to the top, the grand vista opened up before her, and even shestopped in her tracks, awestruck.They had reached Kol Adair."},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 78 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch78]Panting and weary, Nathan came to stand at the top of the pass and inhaled adeep breath of the cold, thin air. The splendor of the view struck him like aphysical blow. “Kol Adair—dear spirits, it’s magnificent!”Since escaping from the Palace of the Prophets, he had witnessed many sights,experienced grand and dramatic events, but he had never before beheld a panoramathat inspired in him such absolute awe. From here, they could see forever.The sun shone down upon the high mountain valley through the lens of a perfectlytransparent blue sky. Regimented black crags spread out in a fiercely beautifulbarrier, their peaks capped with snow. Dramatic couloirs cradled glaciers thatdispatched pearly white ribbons of meltwater over cliffs in a chain ofthundering waterfalls. The cascades sent up a wondrous spray that spawnedrainbows. Mountain lakes in hanging valleys glittered like jewels, the purestturquoise blue, some crusted with broken white ice still unmelted in midsummer.Bannon plodded up beside him, wheezing, too weary to do anything but stare athis boots. When he lifted his head to take in the view, though, he gasped.Nathan continued to drink in the visceral beauty around him. The sweepingmeadows were lush and green, spangled with so many bright and colorful alpineflowers it looked like a meteor shower of blossoms. Even from this distance, hecould hear the soothing roar of the waterfalls that tumbled down the black clifffaces. Bluebirds darted about in the spray or swooped down to snatch insectsamong the wildflowers.On the saddle, Mrra paced around the open terrain, staying close to Nicci. Noneof the three spoke as they absorbed the sight.Nathan filled his lungs with the brisk air and extended his arms to his sides,just reveling in the beauty, the uplifting spectacle. Was this what the witchwoman Red had wanted him to see? Although he gloried in the vista, Nathanwondered if this very place was supposed to restore his gift. He stretched outhis arms, flexed his fingers, wondered if he felt whole again.Restless and not sure what they were supposed to do now that they had arrived,Nicci wandered across the open, flat area. She explored the low grasses,pincushion mounds of pink flowers, and lichen-spattered boulders.Nathan knew there had to be something more if the witch woman had sent themhere, if the command had been written in an old life book and chiseled in thestones of a cairn a continent away. He had to have come here to Kol Adair for areason.Nathan could survive just fine without his gift of prophetic misery, but livingwithout his magic was different. He had drawn great satisfaction from the spellshe could work, the magical weapons he could wield—and he could have been avaluable asset in fighting both the Lifedrinker and Victoria. When he and Niccihad begun their journey, leaving the People’s Palace and heading into the DarkLands, Nathan had believed that the two of them would be invincible, a wizardand a powerful sorceress. He needed to be able to do his part again. He neededhis magic back.And this was the place he should be. But he felt no different.“Look, another cairn!” Bannon said. To mark the top of the pass, some othertraveler had piled up a tall cairn of stones, even more imposing than the onethey had seen on the windswept Phantom Coast. He set off, but plodded slowlybecause he was out of breath.Nicci reached the rocks first. She circled slowly, searching for a message suchas what they had found before. She stopped, looked at the rocks, and frowned.“Nathan, come here.”Hurrying up to her, he felt a surge of hope, longing to feel his Han again, tocontrol his gift and become a useful wizard once more. He needed to be madewhole again!Nathan looked down at the base of the cairn. Among the stacked rocks, like agrave marker, was a flat stone tablet devoid of pervasive lichens. Words hadbeen chiseled into the flat granite surface: Wizard, behold what you need tomake yourself whole again.Nathan felt a surge of delight. He had seen that phrase before. “So the witchwoman was here. Red communicated those words. And they’re written in my lifebook … just as they were engraved on that other cairn.”“Either Red was here in person, or she foresaw it,” Nicci said. “Someone leftthese words, and the witch woman knew about this from the time before prophecywas banished from the world. Kol Adair has been waiting for you for some time,Nathan Rahl.”“But what does it mean?” Bannon asked. “How will you get your magic back?” Heturned a hopeful look to the wizard.Nathan didn’t want to admit that he had no idea of the answer. His brows knittedin concentration, and he made a grandiose gesture to indicate the astonishingvista, trying to convince himself. “Perhaps it is something about this place.Look around you, a sight so marvelous that it’s enough to wash away the darknessin the world.” He gave Nicci a meaningful look. “After killing the Lifedrinkerand Victoria, and after the tragic loss of that poor little Thistle, maybe thisis what we all need to restore ourselves.” He closed his eyes and drew inanother deep, satisfied breath of the clear air.Nicci turned from the cairn. “I need more than a pretty view to heal thedarkness inside me. I am strong enough to do that for myself. I already have astrong purpose.”Nathan swept his gaze across the waterfalls, hanging valleys, snowcapped peaks.His skin tingled, his pulse raced, and he felt a wondrous energy that he drewfrom the earth itself.“This must be a magical place, a nexus of power springing from the world, justas the bones of a dragon carry a certain kind of power,” Nathan said. “Simply bybeing here, I do feel myself restored! Yes, dear spirits, this is what I needed.It was worth the entire journey.”He stretched out his palm, cupped his fingers, and concentrated, rememberingwhat it felt like. He reached for his Han and released a flow of magic,intending to call up a ball of flame. He remembered the last time he hadattempted such a spell, on the windswept deck of the Wavewalker, manifestingonly feathery flickers that had scattered away in the breeze. Now, he meant toproduce a bright blaze cupped in his hand.He had reached Kol Adair. His powers should be back.Nothing happened.He concentrated harder. Nicci and Bannon watched him. But although he strained,he felt no response from his gift. Nothing.His heart, which had felt so uplifted in this magnificent place, now sank intodismay. His magic was gone, unraveled and untangled, stripped from him just ashis ability of prophecy had gone away.“What did I do wrong?” he demanded. “Why haven’t I been restored? I should bemade whole here—look at the words on the cairn! What else do I need to do?” Heraised his voice in desperation, knowing that neither Nicci nor Bannon wouldhave an answer for him.He hung his head. The foundations of the world had changed, and the stars hadshifted overhead. “Maybe with the loss of prophecy, Red’s prediction is nolonger true after all.”"},{"pageContent":" CHAPTER 79 [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ch79]Nicci watched the wizard withdraw into disappointment and defeat. His expressionlooked as bleak as the patches of glaciers across the mountain valley.“Nothing,” he said, flexing his fingers.Nathan Rahl had always been personable, confident, intelligent—a perfect rovingambassador for D’Hara. Nicci had accompanied him on the journey for her ownpurposes, but along the way she had come to value the wizard’s abilities andknowledge. There was more to the former prophet than was immediately obviousfrom his demeanor and his personal façade.Together, they had come a great distance and endured many hardships to find KolAdair, all based on the whim of a witch woman. Yes, this immense, virgin landmust be filled with resources, incredible wealth to whet the appetite of anyambitious ruler. But there was no magic here for Nathan. He had not found whatRed promised.Intensely weary, the old wizard folded his legs and sat on the tundra next tothe cairn’s piled stones. He opened the leather pouch at his side and sadlyremoved his new life book. “I wonder if she left me another message.” When heturned back the cover, he saw only the sketches and journal entries that hehimself had written. Hoping for answers, he skimmed the lines, but the wordsoffered no surprises.Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination.Kol Adair lies far to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard willbehold what he needs to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must savethe world.He closed the cover and tucked it away again. “What should I do and where shouldI go now? I came to Kol Adair. Why haven’t I been made whole?” Now he onlyfrowned at the spectacular view. “What more am I supposed to behold?”Nicci said, “We have the rest of the Old World to explore. Maybe someone elsecan tell you the answer.”Bannon looked down at the carved words in the granite tablet again, as if he hadsomehow misread the simple sentence. “‘Behold what you need to make yourselfwhole again.’” He stood up quickly. “Wait, listen to what it says! The witchwoman didn’t claim you would be restored just by coming to Kol Adair. She saidthis is where you would see what you need.” The young man’s freckled faceflushed with excitement. “Maybe we just haven’t seen it yet.”Nathan struggled to his feet. “That means we have to look for whatever it is Ineed, my boy.” He pursed his lips. “Maybe some magical artifact, or a spell-formlaid out in the rocks here on the pass. The witch woman wouldn’t be so obvious.”“A witch woman rarely is,” Nicci said.Nathan was grinning with renewed hope. “Dear spirits, there’s still a chance …but what are we even looking for?”Bannon bent down to the large cairn and began searching among the mottled rocks,looking for answers. “Maybe something is hidden here. It’s the most obviousthing.” He found a loose stone at the base and rolled it aside, surprised tofind a second flat slab with more engraved words. “I don’t think you’re finishedyet, Nicci.”She felt a chill as she saw the ominous statement carved years—or centuries—ago,but she already guessed what it would say. Sorceress, save the world. “I don’tneed some ancient writing to tell me what to do,” she grumbled.The cairn held no other messages, no artifacts, no clues. At a loss, standing onthe high mountain pass, the companions searched the distance. The grand viewencompassed countless miles of breathtakingly beautiful terrain, but nothing atall that might help the wizard regain his magic.The wind whistled around them, mocking. Nathan’s azure eyes sparkled with a hintof desperate tears, and he stared as if the very intensity could make his needcome true. “We’ve come a very long and difficult way to reach this place.” Heshouted, “I would appreciate instructions that are a little less obtuse!”Just then the sun shone at an angle from a precise spot up in the sky. The airshimmered on the far side of the mountains like a curtain opening, a veil pulledaway—to reveal a sudden, startling vision of a distant plain beyond themountains.Catching a quick breath, Nicci thrust out her arm. “Look there! It’s a … city!”Nathan and Bannon turned. The sand panther let out a low growl.Bannon cried, “That looks even bigger than Tanimura. It wasn’t there before!”Nathan looked giddy with excitement. “No, my boy. No, it wasn’t. Why didn’t wesee it?”Nicci drank in the unbelievable details. The far-off city was a magnificentmetropolis, perhaps greater even than Aydindril and Altur’Rang combined. Theskyline was a forest of fantastic construction, exotic architecture with hightemples and civic buildings, crowded dwellings and elaborate villas. The tallbuildings stretched upward, soaring towers built of white stone. Their roofsshone with vibrant enamel tiles; windows flashed with jewel colors of extensiveglass mosaics.The air around the whole city flickered and blurred, seen through a viewing lensthat sharpened details into amazing clarity before they grew fuzzy again. It wasas if a huge dome shielded the strange metropolis, hiding it—and for just abrief moment, the magic and the vantage from Kol Adair had revealed it to them.The dome was crumbling, fading.“We are seeing it from here, for the first time.” Nathan was breathing hard.“That must be what Red meant! We reached Kol Adair, and from this exactviewpoint, we can see that city. ‘Behold what you need to make yourself wholeagain.’” He turned to Nicci, his smile bright. “We need to go to that city. Theanswer lies there. It has to.”Nicci had spent most of her time in crowded civilization, and she much preferreda city to the austerities of life on the trail. The flickering mirage intriguedher with its possibilities. “I agree.”Before they set off, the air shimmered again—and the entire majestic metropolissimply vanished. On the other side of the mountains, the land appearedcompletely empty.Bannon yelped. “Was it just an illusion?”“Not an illusion,” Nathan insisted. “It can’t be an illusion. Maybe the city ishiding itself somehow, camouflaged by a shroud similar to the one that hidCliffwall for so many centuries.” He nodded, convincing himself as much as theothers. “But now we know it’s there. Come, Sorceress! We still have a longjourney ahead of us, but at least we realize where we have to go.”Mrra continued to rumble with an uneasy growl at the sight, but the wizard wouldnot be deterred. He set off, picking his way down the slope from the pass. Theywould have to cross many mountain valleys and work their way through the starksnowcapped crags before they reached the site of the mysterious vanishing city.As they came over the next ridge, they found a prominent trail from the south, aclear footpath that wound through the mountains. “This is not a game trail,”Nicci said. In one section, the path widened to reveal moss-covered pavingstones, an ancient thoroughfare that had been laid down for traffic. But it hadobviously been used in recent days.“A road!” Nathan could not suppress his optimism. “We are on our way now,Sorceress. That was the sign we needed.”Tall, black rocks blocked their view as they descended another convoluted ridge.When they rounded a barren swell, following the narrow road, Nicci stopped asthey beheld a startling and repulsive sight. Bannon gasped, sickened.Set upon tall spikes on either side of the path were four severed heads, thefaces partially crow-pecked, but otherwise preserved by an anti-decay spell. Theskin on the faces had slackened in death, but their mouths had been horrificallyand distinctively scarred—sliced from the corners of the lips all the way backto the hinge of the jaw, then sewn up and healed. Their cheeks were tattooedwith scales to give them the appearance of serpent men.Nicci recognized them from their attack on the poor people of Renda Bay.Bannon flushed with anger. “Norukai slavers.”“It appears they must have offended someone,” Nathan said.Nicci stepped forward to scrutinize the appalling heads. “The preservation spellmasks how long they’ve been here.”Beneath the first stake rested a blood-spattered placard written in strangesymbols that Nicci couldn’t read. She did, however, recognize the arcane lettersas similar to those branded onto Mrra’s hide.The sand panther growled again, long and low.Nicci flashed a hard smile and looked along the winding trail that led towardthe vanished city. “Yes, that place might be very interesting indeed.”"},{"pageContent":" ALSO BY TERRY GOODKIND[http://us.macmillan.com/author/terrygoodkind?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Wizard’s First Rule[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812548051?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Stone of Tears[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812548099?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Blood of the Fold[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551471?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Temple of the Winds[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551488?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Soul of the Fire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780812551495?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Faith of the Fallen[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984485?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]The Pillars of Creation[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429934893?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Naked Empire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984577?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Debt of Bones[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765351548?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Chainfire[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429984409?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Phantom[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429985093?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Confessor[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429924719?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]The Law of NinesThe Omen Machine[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429965019?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]The First Confessor[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466890817?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]The Third Kingdom[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765370679?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Severed Souls[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429948449?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]Warheart[http://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466890404?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_ebookpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]"},{"pageContent":" ABOUT THE AUTHOR [../Text/contents.xhtml#c_ata]image [../Images/author.jpg]Terry Goodkind[http://us.macmillan.com/author/terrygoodkind?utm_source=ebook&utm_medium=adcard&utm_term=ebookreaders&utm_content=terrygoodkind_authorpage_macdotcom&utm_campaign=9780765388223]is a #1 New York Times bestselling author.
