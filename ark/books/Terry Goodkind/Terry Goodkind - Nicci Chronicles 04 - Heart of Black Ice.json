The white robes he wore over his black pants and fineshirt were stained and scorched from fighting against the impossible, ancientenemy.But he would keep fighting. Though the city of Ildakar was gone, he and hisrebels were still alive.A hundred and fifty thousand reawakened warriors filled the valley below, readyto march across the Old World. Fifteen centuries ago, the legendary GeneralUtros had laid siege to Ildakar, with its shining buildings, high walls, andbeautiful gardens. Using a remarkable petrification spell, the city’s wizardshad turned the army to stone, filling the plain with statues, but now the spellhad worn off, and the invincible army renewed its attack. Desperate to savetheir fabled city, the remaining wizards had hidden Ildakar behind the shroud ofeternity . . . which stranded Nathan and his compatriots outside. Now they werethe only defenders left against an army large enough to conquer the continent.“Dear spirits . . .” He plucked dry grass from his long white hair. The immensemilitary force reminded him of when Jagang’s Imperial Order had filled theAzrith Plain beneath the People’s Palace. Nathan took heart in knowing thatJagang’s army had been defeated, although back then Richard Rahl had fought attheir side. And Nicci . . .Prelate Verna adjusted her skirts and sat on a lichen-stained boulder nearby.“When my party left Cliffwall, we didn’t expect to find an entire army blockingour way. We were just hoping to find Ildakar.”“Ildakar is gone,” groaned the wizard Renn, crunching through the underbrush ashe came up to them. He wrapped his hand around a gnarled pine branch and lookedpast the camped army to where his glorious city had been not long ago. With adistracted frown, he wiped a smear of sticky sap on the frayed fabric of hismaroon robe. “The wizards hid Ildakar from time itself. They didn’t give athought to those of us outside.” His jowls sagged into deep lines. “At leastthey’re safe now . . . I suppose.”“We’ve got to make the most of our situation out here,” Nathan said. He feltmore abandoned than the others, because he had lost more than just the city. Thescorched swath across the battlefield below was a poignant reminder of how dearElsa had sacrificed herself in an inferno of transference magic. In doing so,she had wiped out thousands of General Utros’s soldiers. Tactically speaking, itwas a victory, but at such a tremendous price. He felt dark sadness in his newheart, rather than triumph.Escaping into the hills as the enemy army reeled, Nathan and his companions hadunexpectedly encountered an expedition from Cliffwall—Prelate Verna, severalSisters of the Light, numerous scholars, and a party of D’Haran soldiers led byGeneral Zimmer. Their combined forces, though, were just a handful against atitanic army.Nathan had been fighting so hard and so long that he’d barely had a chance tothink about all they had lost. “How will Nicci get back to us now? If Ildakarhas vanished, where will she go? Where will the sliph take her when she returnsfrom Serrimundi?”Traveling through the sliph network, Nicci had rushed off to the coastal city towarn about the threat facing the Old World. With Ildakar gone, she would be cutoff on the other side of the land.“We could certainly use Nicci’s help,” Verna admitted. “But we are notpowerless. Don’t forget that.”Nathan stroked his chin. “I will not, my dear prelate, but the sorceress isn’tthe only one we have lost.” He didn’t know what had happened to Bannon either,who had been fighting inside Ildakar when the city disappeared. Nathan hoped theeager young swordsman was safe beneath the shroud. He sat beside Verna on thelarge boulder. “This is not the sort of reunion I anticipated having with you. Ispent centuries trying to get my freedom from the Sisters of the Light, and nowhere we are together again.”“Yes, here we are again.” The prelate’s smile was tired, and she tucked a lockof gray-brown hair behind her left ear. “But we need to get moving again.”“But where will we go?” Renn asked, pacing among the pines. “Do we just run? Wecan’t expect to defeat General Utros all by ourselves.”Lord Oron stepped up to them, looking haughty, his blond hair in a thick braidover one shoulder. His narrow face was speckled with fresh blood from the recentbattle. “What is our best course of action? We cannot be just a bunch of rabble.Shall we form our own council of the gifted to fight General Utros?”“It would be a small enough council,” Renn said sourly.“You forget how many gifted we have among us,” Verna said. “Don’t underestimatemy other Sisters of the Light and the Cliffwall scholars.”Lady Olgya joined Oron, her body wrapped in special camouflaged silks, toughfabric that her silkworms had produced back in Ildakar. “Don’t underestimate anyof us. But we can’t just hide in the bushes and watch that army bustle about.What plan should we pursue?”Nathan realized they were all looking to him. “Am I your leader now? Will youcall me wizard commander?” He found it ironic, since he had been unable to usehis gift at all only a short time ago. “I never asked for the job.”Uncomplaining, the former slave Rendell distributed rations of dried food to thegroup. “This is the best meal I can provide, since we don’t dare light cookfires.” The older man had fought for his city along with other freed slaves. Hehad risked his life so Elsa could mark her deadly transference rune on theground. Now Rendell, too, was stranded outside of Ildakar.Oron frowned at the meager fare the former slave offered, being accustomed tofine banquets in the nobles’ district. Nathan, though, chewed on the dried fruitand meat without complaining. He said, “I enjoy fancy meals as well as anyone,not to mention clean clothes and a soft bed, but I will endure a bit of hardshipunder the circumstances.”“Shall we develop a bold plan to defeat that gigantic army?” asked Leo, one ofthe other wizards who had been cut off from Ildakar. His eyes were bright buthis grin looked forced. “Where do we start?”“Lani would have had some unexpected ideas.” Renn stared longingly at where thegreat city had been. He sighed. “I’ll never see her again. When I left, she wasa statue, petrified by Sovrena Thora as punishment, but the spell would haveworn off. I miss her. . . .” The long hard journey had made the portly wizardlose weight. His face was thinner now, and his skin hung loose. “I wish I couldhave talked with her again. It’s been so many centuries.” He drew a hopefulbreath. “Maybe if we can get back through the shroud of eternity—”“Lani is dead, killed by the general’s twin sorceresses,” Oron said withoffhanded bluntness. “Didn’t anyone tell you?”Renn paled until his skin resembled white stone. “Dead?” It was as if Oron hadspoken to him in a different language. He turned to Nathan. “What does he mean?”Nathan wanted to ignite Oron’s hair for his heartless comment. “I’m sorry, Renn.I’m afraid she was killed. . . .” He cleared his throat and tried to sound assoothing as he could. “Lani used a pool of water to spy on the general’s camp,but Ava and Ruva turned the magic back on her. They . . . drowned her.” He shookhis head. “Elsa and I fought to save her, but there was nothing we could do.”Renn placed his face in his hands. “That was the only thread of hope I stillhad.” His shoulders shook as he sobbed. “I waited for her. I protected her. Imourned for her. . . . She . . .” He struggled to find the right word. “Shemattered a great deal to me.”“I’m sorry you didn’t get to see her again,” Nathan said. “She was brave andstrong. I’ll never forget what she did.”Olgya sounded grim and impatient. “No time for mourning any one person.Countless people have been lost, and we have suffered. Think of my son Brock,Oron’s son Jed, the thousands of fighters. They all mattered to someone.”Renn glowered at her. “It still hurts.”“It still hurts, my friend,” Nathan agreed, thinking of Elsa and what she hadbegun to mean to him. “And we need to hurt the enemy.”Sudden shouts came from the forest nearby, and Nathan lurched to his feet,reaching for the sword at his side. General Zimmer’s soldiers in the scatteredcamp grabbed their weapons and formed ranks for mutual defense. Figures sprintedout of the forest.“Get ready! Here they come!” Zimmer’s voice held a hard edge of anticipation.Three people burst through the underbrush, running at full speed. Oliver andPeretta, two young scholars from Cliffwall, dashed forward, along with Amber, anovice Sister of the Light. “They’re right behind us!”“We brought them here,” Peretta called to her startled companions. “Now it’syour turn!” Despite the flush on her narrow face, mischief sparkled in her eyes.More crashing sounds echoed through the sparse forest, followed by gruff shouts.Lured onward by the trio of runners, twenty enemy soldiers blundered into thecamp, hacking branches out of the way. They wore ancient-styled leather armorbearing the distinctive flame symbol of Emperor Kurgan. Oliver, Peretta, andAmber scampered ahead, taunting their pursuers into the trap.One of the enemy soldiers bellowed, “There’s more of them!” He held up a curvedsword. “Wipe them out.”In a blur, two fierce women rushed in from opposite sides, letting outhigh-pitched yells. They had been waiting to strike. Each morazeth wore a blackleather band around her chest and waist, and their skin was mottled with brandedsymbols.“We will let you kill a few of them,” Thorn called out to Nathan and the others.“But not every one.” She held a short sword in one hand and a dagger in theother. She plunged her sword into the stomach of the nearest soldier and laughedas he crumpled. “That’s one!”Not to be outdone, her companion Lyesse snapped a barbed whip, which wrappedaround an opponent’s thick neck. She yanked it hard, ripping open his throat.“And one for me!”Thrusting out his hand, Nathan threw a burst of wizard’s fire that struck anenemy in the chest. The man’s leather and plate armor was like paper against thedeadly fire that burned through his torso.Howling a war cry, Zimmer’s soldiers threw themselves into the fight. The enemyscouts clashed with the D’Haran soldiers in a clatter of blades, grunts of pain,and shouts of anger.With the fighters milling together, Nathan could not risk more wizard’s fire.Prelate Verna used her gift to dislodge a heavy bough from the trees above anddropped it directly onto a soldier. Oron, Olgya, Leo, and Renn summoned a ragingwind to slam more armored men into tree trunks.Finding themselves in a real fight, the enemy soldiers fell back on their rigidmilitary training. The pair of wild morazeth attacked as if they themselves werean army, and the D’Haran soldiers tried to keep up with the women, kill forkill.As the enemies fell bleeding, Nathan noticed something he had not expected.Previously, General Utros’s soldiers had been partially stone, their skin hardand chalky, but now they were real flesh again! He caught his breath. And if theenemy was fully human again, that would make them easier to kill. The D’Haransteel cut through the armor, hacked skin and bone, and the ancient enemies nowdied like normal men.The gifted fighters Leo and Perri used magic to knock soldiers off their feet,impaling them on sharp branches. Even the slave Rendell jumped in with a knife,pulling off the helmet of a stunned soldier and slitting his throat. Nathanspotted an outlying man and used wizard’s fire to burn his head entirely off hisshoulders like a grisly lantern.In short order, all twenty of the ancient scouts lay dead in the underbrush.Thorn and Lyesse stood grinning, their bronzed skin covered with blood. “Three!”said Lyesse.“Three for me as well,” Thorn responded.“And that’s twenty more dead,” Nathan said. “Twenty fighters erased from theenemy forces.”“The army will not even notice those losses,” Verna said. “Alas.”“General Utros hasn’t finished counting his dead from our last attack,” saidOron.“Dead men are dead men,” Renn said with grim satisfaction.The D’Haran soldiers wiped bloodstains from their swords and armor. Zimmernodded to each man, complimenting them. “Until we have a better plan, we willcut that army down little by little.”“If that’s the way it must be,” Lady Olgya said.Nathan sheathed his sword, which he had not needed after all. He still reveledin using magic after being without his gift for so long. “At least it’s astart.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [part0003.html#a7]The empty city towered around Nicci, silent and mysterious. She turned to gether bearings and assessed the dark buildings, the imposing stone walls, thethick pillars and ornate carvings . . . the utter bleakness. This was notIldakar, not at all.The moon spilled silver light over the ruins, but she saw no cheerful lanternsor torches lighting any of the stone structures. All the windows and doors wereblack and vacant, like the eyes of dead men. The thin air held an underlyingchill. She could see the silhouettes of black crags that ringed the city, andshe realized she must be high in the mountains.Nicci stepped away from the sliph well, angry and confused. Her body ached, asif the abortive journey had wrung her like a washrag. “Sliph!” she shouted, butthe quiet was so deep and intense that it buzzed in her ears.The spiteful silver creature had dumped her here and abandoned her.In the middle of a central plaza, a waist-high stone barrier surrounded theenigmatic well. The sliph had simply retreated down into the depths afterlashing out at Nicci, leaving her alone. She had no idea where she was.As Nicci caught her breath and her balance, she felt uncharacteristically weak,disconnected. She had never felt like this when traveling in the sliph before.She called to the deep, empty well. “Come back! This is not my destination. Iwish to travel.”Her words resonated in the deep black gullet and whispered back at her from thehigh stone buildings, but no other sound came. The silvery creature refused torespond. This particular sliph, a determined adherent of Emperor Sulachan’slong-lost cause, had finally realized that Nicci did not, in fact, serve thesame master. When Nicci had revealed that Sulachan was dead, defeated not oncebut twice, the silvery woman had broken her bonds of duty and stranded Nicci inthis forsaken place.“Sliph! Where am I?” Nicci’s voice vanished into infinity below. She could donothing to help fight General Utros if she was trapped . . . here.As her head rang and throbbed, Nicci wondered how much damage she had sufferedin the dangerous passage. She remembered that the sliph had said one otherintriguing thing before leaving: “Ildakar is gone. Ildakar is no more. I cannottake you there.” Clearly, the sliph had also been damaged when she tried toreach her destination, and failed.How could Ildakar be “no more”? Maybe the sliph well in the lower levels of thelegendary city had been destroyed or sealed somehow. What else could prevent thesliph from traveling there?Then Nicci recalled something else. Before she’d killed Kor, the Norukaicaptain, he revealed that King Grieve had launched a massive attack againstIldakar. How could the great city defend itself against the invincible army ofGeneral Utros as well as a second threat from the Norukai? Was it possible thatthe wizards’ duma had raised the shroud of eternity as their only recourse?Would they have left the rest of the world to face the scourge alone? Yes, thewizards of Ildakar would have done exactly that.And if that were the case, Nicci would be on her own.First, she had to find out where she was. Her close-cropped blond hair was dustyfrom hard travel. She still had blood on her skin and black dress from fightingthe Norukai in Serrimundi Harbor. Her body felt shaky and sore, an aftereffectof the sliph passage. Her gift was weak.Exploring her new surroundings, Nicci studied the massive pillars and stonebuildings, huge monuments, temples, or governmental halls. As she moved acrossthe plaza, her feet whispered on the uneven flagstones. The city was litteredwith looming stone towers and fallen arches, long-dry fountains, intricatedecorations weathered into indeterminate lumps.The structures were immense and ostentatious, designed to inspire awe. Theimposing grandeur reminded her of Emperor Jagang’s palace in Altur’Rang or theWizard’s Keep in Aydindril. This place had once been a large population center,a capital, or at least a major trading hub. But all the doorways and windowswere sealed or bricked up, like crypts. This was a city of the dead.She heard a rustling sound and saw a pair of wild deer wandering through theempty park, eating the shrubs and flowers. Startled to see Nicci, the deerskittered off, but halted not far away and went back to grazing.In another magnificent square, Nicci came upon the enormous statue of a man,which now lay broken on the flagstones. The raised marble base was the size of abuilding’s foundation, and originally the titan must have towered three storieshigh, but only the sturdy boots remained attached to the base. Someone hadsmashed the legs, intentionally toppling the statue.She absorbed the scene and felt an undertone of violence and destruction here.The stone arms had broken off, and now the remnants lay overgrown with vines.She stepped up to the toppled statue and regarded it, ignoring the moss anddust. The man’s haughty face had a heavy brow and hooked nose, and his hair hungin snakelike braids beneath a blocky crown. The carved mouth was open in aweathered smile, showing one prominent pointed tooth, clearly an affectation.With growing suspicion, Nicci walked around the toppled statue to the front ofthe base, where engraved letters were worn down but still readable.EMPEROR KURGANNicci turned back to the head of the fallen statue. The pointed tooth must bethe iron fang Kurgan had worn to intimidate those in his presence. He had been aviolent and capricious emperor who skinned his wife alive and fed her to fleshbeetles when he learned of her affair with General Utros. Outraged at what hehad done, Iron Fang’s own people had overthrown him and dragged his body throughthe streets. They had even smashed his statue.Even now, after fifteen centuries, Nicci took grim satisfaction at seeing thisevidence of his demise. Given the broken figure of the despised emperor, as wellas the immense buildings and monuments, Nicci had a good idea of where she was.This city must be Orogang, capital of Kurgan’s vast empire, which had collapsedafter his downfall.She turned slowly as the pieces fell into place, but she still didn’t understandwhy the city itself was a graveyard. Even with Kurgan dead and the empire tornapart by political turmoil, why would such an important metropolis have beenabandoned? Why would the population have left these impressive buildings to therats and spiders? Where would the people have gone? Had a plague wiped them out?A famine or drought?And why were the doors sealed and the windows bricked shut, as if to sealsomething inside?She passed a sunken amphitheater, a deep round bowl with circular tiers of seatsleading down to a central stage at the bottom. Kurgan must have addressed thepeople from there, his voice resounding up the walls of the deep bowl. The seatswere empty now, many of them crumbled, the stage overgrown with weeds.Beyond the amphitheater, Nicci found a second towering statue, but this onelooked barely weathered, as if someone had maintained it over the centuries. Thefigure was a muscular, broad-chested warrior wearing a helmet and ornate armoronce emblazoned with Kurgan’s stylized flame, though the symbol had beendefaced, leaving only a white scar on the stone. The handsome, broad facebeneath the helmet’s scooped cheek guards had a firm jaw, piercing eyes, strongcheekbones, a regal-looking nose.Nicci knew this man, had faced him on the battlefield. General Utros—Iron Fang’sgreatest military commander, who had been dispatched from Orogang to conquer theOld World in the name of his emperor. Utros had accepted the mission withoutquestioning the worthiness of his leader, because Utros was a man who didn’tquestion orders.Judging by the condition of the sculpture, the people of Orogang had revered thegeneral. It seemed odd to her that the Utros monument was even now clean ofdebris and stains, not dilapidated like the rest of this empty city. She frozewhen she spotted fresh flowers strewn on one corner of the base.Someone had been here, and recently.Suddenly wary, she looked around. The buildings remained silent, some of themcollapsing, but others deceptively intact. Maybe some hermit or devotee hadplaced a flower at the statue of his hero. No one here would possibly guess thatUtros could still be alive after fifteen hundred years.Nicci sensed something more than the loneliness of this place, but a presence,eyes watching her. Orogang might not be as abandoned and desolate as she hadthought. Staring into the shadows cast by the moon, she heard a rustle ofmovement. At first she thought it might just be the wandering deer, thenrealized it was a different kind of furtive sound. Footsteps.Nicci spun, reaching out with her gift, though she still felt weak and strange.“Who is there?”The hush fell again after her words faded. She turned toward the largeststructure that dominated the main plaza, a massive building with tall flutedcolumns at the grand entryway. The doors were now open, though they revealedonly darkness within. Beyond the Utros statue, she saw more movement, a shadowdarting into deeper shadows, multiple gray-clad human figures melting into themurk.Nicci turned cautiously, alert. “Reveal yourselves! Come out and face me.” Hervoice sounded as loud as a gong in the empty city. She touched the daggers ateach hip and prepared to defend herself.At last, she was able to discern human silhouettes as they emerged from hidingplaces, darkened doorways, narrow alleys. The strangers moved with trepidation,whispering among themselves. They refused to answer her.“Who are you?” Nicci turned in a slow circle and realized the figures were allaround her, but she could barely sense them, as if they were only spirits. Shesaw many more people than she expected.Looking beyond the city, she saw a faint glow of dawn outlining the mountaincrags and revealing more figures scuttling out of their stone-walled lairs andconverging on her.Nicci let her hands rest threateningly on the daggers. “I don’t want to attackyou, but I will.”The brightening dawn seemed to agitate them, and she heard urgent voices rising,but the few snatches of words made no sense to her. Nicci backed toward the baseof the Utros statue and stared up at the stone face that merely gazed ahead.Then, as if they heard a silent signal, the shadowy people lunged forward tosurround her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 [part0003.html#a7]After the wave of fire had incinerated thousands of his brave soldiers, GeneralUtros saw how the battlefield was devastated. The sour smoke of burned grass androasted flesh lingered in the air for days, and he doubted he would ever get thetaste and stink from the back of his throat. The loss of so many loyal men feltlike a hot knife through his heart.Elsa’s transference magic was far more powerful than he had ever imagined. Toolate, Ava and Ruva had realized that the defenders were marking boundary runesto unleash terrible magic. Too late, Utros had seen the individual strike forcesencompass part of the valley around his army. Too late, he had watched thegifted Elsa lay down the anchor rune at the center of camp and trigger herdevastating spell. The twins had barely shielded him in time.His thousands of soldiers hadn’t had a chance.Even with the breathtaking losses, though, his army was still more than ahundred thousand strong. His warriors were incensed, ready for blood, hungry toconquer the land from horizon to horizon, and he would lead them to victory.That was what he had vowed to Emperor Kurgan, even if his emperor was long dead.In the late afternoon of a troublesome day, Utros adjusted the golden mask thatcovered half of his face. His helmet bore the horns of an enormous bull, anIldakaran monster that he himself had killed. He stood outside the pavilion hissoldiers had erected, a replacement for his burned-down command headquarters.The fabric was a patchwork of salvaged pieces, and the wooden posts were roughlyhewn from charred trees, but General Utros did not require the ostentatioustrappings Iron Fang would have demanded. The tent provided shelter and shade,which was what he needed.Standing out in the open, he smelled ashes in the wind. Ava and Ruva stoodclose, stroking his heavily muscled arms, the copper wristbands. “We are readyto receive the Norukai king, beloved Utros,” said Ava.“And we are ready to conquer the world,” replied her twin sister.The identical sorceresses were beautiful in their blue gowns. They had shavedand scraped every trace of hair from their bodies, then painted their skin withswooping curves and angular designs that invoked arcane powers. Instead of theirusual multicolored pigments, Ava and Ruva now marked themselves with black sootand dried blood, which was more powerful than paint.“We will impress our new allies with the strength of our army,” Ava said, “butour hospitality is sorely lacking.”Her sister added, “We cannot offer King Grieve a feast.”Utros clenched his jaw, knowing their situation was far more serious than that.Once Ildakar had disappeared in front of them, his army no longer had hope ofraiding the city for food and matériel. He had counted on that for their verysurvival.He looked toward where the plain abruptly dropped down to the Killraven Riverand the extensive morass of swamps below. “King Grieve will bring provisionsfrom his raiding fleet. It will be enough for now.” Utros did not manage toconvince himself. “Keeper and spirits,” he whispered under his breath.From the river drop-off he watched a party of the Norukai raiders trudgingforward as if they meant to conquer the valley. He knew this was only a smalldelegation from the serpent ships on the river. The big raiders were hideouslyscarred, clad in vests of sharkskin leather or reptilian hides. Even from adistance he recognized King Grieve and his prancing albino shaman, the ganglyscarred man known as Chalk.Behind them came a group carrying crates, barrels, and sacks—enough supplies tofeed a small army. Unfortunately, Utros had a large army, and now that the stonespell had entirely worn off, they were a hungry army.Just after Ildakar vanished beneath the shroud, the lingering remnants of thestone spell had suddenly and inexplicably faded from his troops, and they becameentirely human again, flesh, blood, and bone. At first, the army had rejoiced atbeing able to feel again, but Utros quickly realized that their restoredhumanity also brought them vulnerabilities. When they were still half petrified,the numerous regiments had experienced no hunger or thirst; now, though, theyall felt the needs of the flesh. He had a hundred thousand mouths to feed, outhere in the middle of a vast valley with no city to raid and no supply train.First Commander Enoch arrived at the command pavilion, grim-faced with hisreport. Utros wanted his majordomo to join the discussions regarding their newalliance. The veteran pressed a fist against his heart and then looked at thesupplies carried by the Norukai. With only a glance, he made his assessment.“That stockpile will be enough to feed the officers down to the squadcommanders. We can ration carefully.”“It won’t be enough for all of us,” Utros said, keeping his voice low.King Grieve, Chalk, and six more raider captains approached the pavilion,trudging across the burned grass. Facing the general, Grieve clacked his jawstogether. His cheeks were slashed all the way back to the hinge of the jaw andsewn up again. Tattoos covered his face, symbolic scales of his serpent god. Theking’s chest was enormously broad, as if he had an extra set of lungs so hecould dive deep and wrestle sharks. Implanted bone spurs protruded from hisshoulders. Instead of a belt, an iron chain encircled his waist.“We brought food, as you requested. Let us have a celebration feast!” Grievegestured to the downtrodden slaves who served as beasts of burden. The slavespiled the supply crates, sacks, and barrels outside the pavilion, near largecook fires that had already been lit.“My hunters also provided three deer they killed in the hills,” Utros offered.“We will roast them as part of the meal.”“You can have all the fish,” Grieve grumbled. “I am sick of fish. I’ll take thevenison.”“Fish, fish!” Chalk capered about. “Suck the bones and chew the heads. I likehow the eyeballs pop.” He bent his elbows at odd angles as he hopped from onefoot to the other. “My Grieve, King Grieve! They’ll all grieve!” He wore only aloincloth of sewn-together fish skins, leaving his skin bare, as if he wanted toshow off the bite marks that covered his body, thousands of pocked holes fromtiny fanged mouths. His mangled lip made his grin horribly twisted.Ava and Ruva regarded the shaman with displeasure. In unison they lifted theirchins, haughty and beautiful, as if to emphasize the inferiority of Grieve’scompanion.“Today is more than just a celebration feast.” Utros tried to sound diplomaticas he led the Norukai party under the stretched fabric of the pavilion. He usedhis best skills of diplomacy, because he needed this large fighting force andtheir ships. “We must plan our war, together. My army needs to move, since wehave many mouths to feed.” He gestured out to where the soldiers had set uprough tents and bedding in the blackened valley. “Our numbers may be unwieldy,but we are invincible. My army will conquer any lands we encounter.”Grieve chuffed out a loud laugh. “You mean, any lands the Norukai leave foryou!”Utros spoke firmly. “The Old World is ours.”“Yes, ours. Mine and yours.”Utros remained firm, businesslike. “Together, we have to contemplate strategy.We can’t simply rampage across the continent. We must conquer and use it.”The Norukai king was impatient. “As you wish, but we can break the continentjust a little. I need the exercise.”Ava and Ruva watched Grieve and his albino with intent gazes. The Norukai kingopenly leered at the two women, but they did not respond. Utros knew the twinsdidn’t need protection. The sorceresses could kill anyone who bothered them.As the deer carcasses roasted over the fire and the fish cooked on smallerspits, First Commander Enoch oversaw the distribution of Norukai supplies amongthe army, stretching the food as far as possible.Later, while he gnawed on bloody meat from a joint, King Grieve frowned at theemptying crates. “That is the rest of our supplies from our ships.” He did notsound upset. Rather, his voice had an insulting undertone. “You worry too muchabout food.”“My soldiers must eat,” Utros said. “My challenge is managing the supplies andstockpiles.”“Then your soldiers are weak.” The Norukai king reached inside his wide mouthand used a fingertip to dig a morsel of meat from his back molar. “We don’tworry about supplies. We raid to take what we need, then we move on.”“They’ll all grieve!” Chalk said.“We will have to follow your example,” the general conceded, though the emptyfoothills and the great valley offered few resources.King Grieve leaned forward, studying the general’s half mask. “I may want one ofthose myself. I like the way it looks.”Utros peeled off the golden covering to reveal his flayed face. By now the woundhad healed, the dark muscle scabbed and hardened over the skull. “It was not mychoice. It was necessary for a spell.”The Norukai nodded appreciatively and fingered the mouth scars on his owncheeks. “Sometimes we do what is necessary.” He planted his elbows on the roughwooden table. “So tell me your plan to conquer the world.”Utros gazed beyond the pavilion toward his huge army. “I have many thousands offighters, armed and ready to march. Are any of your ships still intact afterbeing crushed in the river ice?”Chalk squirmed at the rough-hewn table. “Ships and fish, ice and fire, greatserpent ships.” He grinned. “Serpent ships! Splintered ships now!”“Not splinters!” Grieve roughly knocked the albino in the shoulder, thenapologized by sweeping his arm around Chalk, squeezing the scrawny man. He facedUtros. “When the river froze, a hundred ships were anchored in the river, manyup against the docks so we could climb the bluffs and invade Ildakar. The icecrushed some hulls, snapped the keels.” He pounded a heavy fist on the table.His knuckles, augmented with small iron plates, made the wood ring loudly fromthe blow. “But we will repair them. The Norukai are great shipbuilders.” Grieveglanced behind him toward where the land dropped abruptly to the river. “Theswamps provide all the wood we need. We have tools. We have slaves.”The general took him at his word. “We will need your vessels and your Norukaifighters for the war. You said you have many more ships back at your islands? Werequire your navy and your fighters, along with my entire army.” He grew moreserious. “Your ships will move faster down the river out to sea. Even at a hardpace, my army will take longer to travel overland to the coast.”“Some of my serpent ships are nearly repaired, and I am anxious to move, too,”Grieve said. “I will sail back to our Norukai islands, where I expect anotherhundred ships will be completed by now. My raiders are thirsty for victory andplunder. While we wait for your marching soldiers, we will attack cities on thecoast, like a storm of steel and blood.”In his calculating mind, Utros manipulated the pieces, saw the large tacticalpicture. “If the Norukai raiders attack the coast, and my army sweeps overland,we will form a pincer across the Old World.”Grieve bit down on the bone from which he had stripped the deer meat. “We willcrush the land like a grape between two fingers. It is a good plan.”“Once our fighting forces unite,” Utros added, “we will march together andsubjugate Tanimura, Altur’Rang, and then move on to the New World.”“King Grieve!” Chalk cried. “They’ll all grieve.”“Yes, they’ll all grieve,” said General Utros.The Norukai weren’t much for small talk. After they finished their feast, theraiders were anxious to get back to their ships. Like General Utros, they hadexpected to conquer Ildakar, but now that the city itself was gone, neither armyhad a reason to remain here in this empty place. King Grieve departed as if thetwo commanders had planned the entire war in detail, and Utros realized that theNorukai were not much for planning. They simply attacked, moved on, thenreturned whenever they felt like it.He suspected Grieve would be an even worse leader than Iron Fang had been, butUtros would worry about the brute later, when it became an issue. He would usethese violent Norukai to accomplish his aims. He had sworn to grind the entirecontinent under his boot heel—out of loyalty to his emperor and secretly out oflove for Majel. Now all of that had broken inside him, and so Utros would haveto do it for himself and no other reason.The Norukai returned to the bluffs above the river and climbed back down totheir damaged ships. When the ugly raiders were gone, First Commander Enochapproached Utros, deeply concerned. “All the supplies were distributed, General.They did not go far.”“I did not expect them to,” Utros said. “There was truth in what the Norukaiking said. Recently, our scouts mapped out some nearby settlements. We knowwhere there are supplies for the taking—at least a few—and we must have them.Disperse raiding parties in all directions. Find every town and strip them ofevery scrap of food.” He lowered his head. “It’s the only way our army cansurvive.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [part0003.html#a7]As the following dawn spilled across the river flatlands, Norukai taskmasterspounded on drums to rouse the groaning slaves, kicking the ones who didn’t moveswiftly enough.“Time to work!” bellowed Gara, a muscular female shipwright with gray braidsdangling like drowned vipers from her patchy scalp. “Work until your fingersbleed.” She opened her scarred mouth and snapped her teeth back together.Tied on the tilted deck of a damaged Norukai ship, Bannon squirmed to avoid avicious kick. A raider cut his bonds so he could join the others at work.The captives set about their repairs in the faint dawn light. Gara used a malletto pound boards and pegs into place, but Bannon had seen the ugly woman employthe bulky tool to bash the skull of a slave who worked too slowly.As Bannon rubbed his raw wrists where the rope had chafed him during the night,the ghostly pale shaman crept up and grasped his shoulders with spidery fingers.“Time to hammer, or time to be a nail!”Bannon shook him off, uneasy about the strange behavior of the scarred albino.At least he understood the uncouth Norukai, but Chalk was deeply unsettling. Forsome reason, the shaman found him fascinating.After days of captivity, Bannon’s body was battered and sore. He still hadhealing cuts, torn fingers, and massive bruises from fighting the Norukaiinvaders on the bluffs below Ildakar. He had nearly killed Chalk and King Grievebefore they all tumbled down the cliffside to crash in a heap of bodies andweapons.But rather than dying then, Bannon had been taken as a slave. Being captured bythe Norukai was one of his greatest nightmares, ever since the slavers tried toseize him as a boy on Chiriya Island. Back then, his best friend, Ian, had beenseized in his stead while Bannon got away, and he had regretted that moment ofcowardice ever since. Now, many years later, he found himself a slave after all.Chalk shook him by the shoulders again, and Bannon lashed out instinctively,remembering what they had done to Ian. “Don’t touch me, filthy Norukai!”The albino cackled, delighted by Bannon’s reaction. In the brightening daylight,King Grieve saw him rebuff his pale friend, and the big man strode forward, hisexpression like an angry storm rolling across the sea. “Show respect or die,slave!” Grieve grabbed Bannon by the neck and yanked him off the deck. “Are youworth the air you breathe? Are you worth the water you piss?”Bannon struggled, ready to fight back even though he knew he’d be severelybeaten or killed. He was not a coward, but he would not be an example for thesemonsters.Scowling, shipwright Gara stepped up to intervene. “Break him later, my king. Weneed the workers if you want these ships repaired. Lost three men yesterday, andwe’re not getting any more workers from the city.” The shipwright glanced at thebluffs rising above the river. The top of the cliff above, where Ildakar hadbeen, looked like a cleanly sheared tree stump, the city simply swept away. “Weneed to use the ones we have, at least until we’re done.”Grieve released his hold and let Bannon drop unceremoniously to the slanteddeck. He raised a heavy battle-axe in his hand, threatening, and that provoked adelighted reaction from Chalk. He crowed, “The axe cleaves the wood! The swordcleaves the bone!”Bannon didn’t know what the shaman meant, but his jabbering often made no sense.Chalk looked at Bannon and nodded, as if he expected the young man to agree withhim. “The axe cleaves the wood! The sword cleaves the bone!”Grieve dismissed his odd friend. “My axe can cleave bone just as well, and itwill take off this one’s head as soon as the ship repairs are done.”“Not yet, my Grieve. Not yet.” Chalk stroked Bannon’s long ginger hair, whichmade his skin crawl. “Not this one.”Slave crews got to work among the numerous damaged vessels. The Norukai fleethad consisted of a hundred serpent ships sailing up the Killraven River andclosing on Ildakar. The raiders had intended to climb the bluffs and overwhelmthe city’s defenses, but they didn’t know anything about the besieging army ofGeneral Utros on the other side of the city. Bannon and his morazeth partnerLila had fought with hundreds of other defenders on the cliffs, hurling downprojectiles, battling with spears and swords to drive the raiders away, but theNorukai had overwhelmed them.He had fallen from the cliff, been knocked unconscious and taken captive. Bannondidn’t know what had happened to Lila since then, and even if he managed toescape from the countless hundreds of watchful Norukai all around him, he didnot know how he could reunite with his friends. Nathan had been leading a hugeraid against General Utros when the city vanished beneath the shroud ofeternity, and Nicci had gone on another mission, to warn Serrimundi. Bannon hadno hope of meeting up with any of them ever again, so he would have to fend forhimself. If he ever got away.When Elsa’s transference magic had frozen the entire river, the ice-locked shipswere structurally damaged. The angry Norukai now worked like ants, makingrepairs and forcing their captives to do the hardest labor, cutting down treesin the swamps, dragging the logs back, and sawing the wood into lumber.Some of the serpent ships had sunk to the silty river bottom. Those wrecks werestripped of ropes, which were used to repair the rigging of other ships. Sheetsof midnight-blue sailcloth were moved to the intact ships and mounted as sails.Workers sawed the masts from the scuttled ships and installed them on othervessels; salvaged wood provided new hull boards where needed. Expert Norukaishipwrights like Gara moved from vessel to vessel directing the repairs,commanding slave teams.Always looking for his chance to escape, Bannon reluctantly hauled lengths ofrope from one deck to another, carrying tools and supplies. During the hot,endless work, he considered using the mallets and pry bars as weapons. He knewhe could harm several of the slavers, but it would be an impotent gestureagainst thousands of ruthless Norukai, and he would just end up dead. Hewrestled with what to do.The day before, one of the Ildakar slaves attempted to fight back and succeededin injuring one Norukai, who was taken by surprise with his back turned. ThoughBannon applauded the man’s effort, it was poorly planned, and the Norukaiinstantly subdued the rebellious slave. They were not quick about killing him.They forced Bannon and the other captives to watch as they broke the bones inthe slave’s arms one at a time, then his legs. They piled heavy weight stones onhis chest, one after another with a long pause in between, until his ribscracked, his eyes hemorrhaged, and blood spouted from his mouth. When the poorman gasped for mercy, one of the Norukai simply stepped on the weights, slowlypressing until his sternum cracked.Though Bannon wanted to murder these tormentors, he wouldn’t waste his life tono purpose. He watched and waited, knowing an opportunity would arise, and hehoped he could help the other captives as well as himself.Sullen slaves dismantled a sunken wreck, using pry bars to detach the hullboards for patching holes in other vessels. The exhausted workers were fedlittle and allowed no rest. They had only the greenish river water to drink.King Grieve bellowed from the prow of one of the nearly finished ships. “I wantto sail soon. Finish these ships so we can head back to the Norukai islands andlaunch our war.”Bannon muttered, “Since so many Norukai were killed here, you’ll need fewerships going home.” The shipwright reached over and slapped Bannon hard on theface, bloodying his lip and leaving a bright red mark on his cheek.Chalk laughed as if the young swordsman’s remark was the funniest thing he hadever heard. He squatted in front of Bannon and nodded, grinning. Unfortunately,the king also heard the comment. Grieve grabbed him again, ready to kill him,but Gara hissed her warning again. “We need him to work!”The king lifted Bannon and tossed him over the side of the ship and into theriver. “He can work at the waterline, soaking up mud and slime.”With a yelp, Bannon fell, plunging into the river. Spluttering, he struggled forsomething to hold on to. He trod water and looked up, his reddish hair hangingin muddy strands like weeds. Grieve leaned over the rail and growled from above.“Next time I’ll put weights on your ankles! Then you can repair the bottom ofthe boat until you drown.”Chalk peered over the rail, staring down at Bannon with incomprehensibleconcern.Gara threw a mallet down to him, which splashed in the water. Four other slaveswere tied to the listing ship alongside spare boards and wooden buckets filledwith nails. The river sounds hummed in the oppressive humid air around them.Norukai guards passed close in landing boats, ferrying equipment and people fromone serpent vessel to the next, while also keeping watch on the slaves workingat the waterline.Bannon realized that further resistance—today—would accomplish nothing more, sohe grudgingly took the floating mallet and followed instructions. For now.Picking up one of the patch boards, he reached into a bucket of nails that hungon a rope and joined the other slaves in pounding the wood into place,overlapping hull boards. Another slave dug his hands into a pot of warm pitchand slathered a waterproof seal across the wood.A nearby slave commiserated, “Terrible duty, but better than bilge work.”Bannon had seen other slaves going into the dark and stuffy lower decks of thedamaged ships, hauling out buckets of water so the vessels could float higher.“I guess we can always think of something worse.” Optimism had often beenBannon’s saving grace, and he clung to hope that frequently turned out to befoolish. But it was the core of his personality. He would find a way to escapethese disgusting captors, and he would make things better. He wouldn’t give up.The slave beside him let out a bitter chuckle. “This is much better than thebilge—” Suddenly, his face twisted in an expression of pain and terror. Heflailed at the rope holding him, but something yanked his body beneath the waterbefore he could scream. The rope stretched tight, then snapped, and bloodblossomed in the water.Bannon instinctively reached out to save the man, but the victim was snatchedaway. The other slaves scrambled to get out of the river as the knobby reptilianback of a swamp predator broke the surface and swam briskly away with the poorman’s broken body in its scissorlike jaws. The swamp dragon dove under thewater, taking its meal.The slaves in the water screamed, pulling on their ropes as they tried to liftthemselves to safety. Bannon grabbed the snapped cable that had held the victimand used it to climb the hull, reaching down to help the others. Norukai rushedto the rails with boat hooks and spears. They jabbed downward, knocking theslaves away. “Back in the water. Back to work!”“Monsters in the river!” one of the slaves cried. “We’ll be killed.”“You should be more afraid of us than anything down there,” Gara said.Bannon still held his wooden mallet, wishing he had his faithful sword, Sturdy.He wanted to kill these hideous people, but as he looked up at the forest ofjagged spear points, the curved swords and the angry scarred faces, he realizedhe would just be throwing his life away. Chalk was watching him, shaking hishead and wagging his finger, as if warning Bannon.Despising the Norukai more than ever, Bannon let himself slip back into theriver, alert for ripples in the water and the scaly backs of swamp monsters.Soon he knew he was going to have to kill something.*Lila kept to the thickets on the riverbank, hidden but close enough that shecould have thrown a spear and killed a Norukai warrior, right out in the open.But right now that would have wasted her element of surprise to no good purpose.She had already quietly killed nine of them under cover of darkness and fedtheir bodies to predators, and that satisfied her for a while. Now, though, shelurked in her camouflage, watching and waiting for her chance.Bannon needed her.When Ildakar had disappeared in the middle of the battle, she, too, had fallenfrom the bluff. Despite what should have been a fatal plunge, she had tumbledinto shallow water and soft river mud. Stunned, Lila had drifted down thecurrent until her body caught in the tangled bushes, where she pulled herself toshore. The Norukai hadn’t seen her.Now, days later, her short brown hair was caked with mud, and her face wassunburned. She wore only scant black leather. The branded runes on her skinprotected her from magic, but did nothing to ward off insect bites or dangerousthorns. She had a dagger, but she had lost her short sword in the fall. Sinceshe was a morazeth, though, her entire body was a weapon. She relied on hermuscles and reflexes. She would bide her time and do whatever damage she could,any time she caught one of the Norukai alone. . . .Lila and her morazeth sisters had sworn to defend Ildakar, which was now gone,but she had also accepted personal responsibility for Bannon, promising toprotect him. She had trained the boy in the combat pits, challenged him with herharshest exercises. She had even occasionally taken him as a lover to reward himwhen he did well, and as time went by, she found more and more excuses to rewardhim in such a way. Lila didn’t understand why the young swordsman failed toappreciate all that she had taught him. Her hard lessons had certainly saved hislife more than once.At one point, during an assault on the army of General Utros, Bannon had beentaken prisoner and nearly killed. That incident had shown her that she didn’twant to lose him. She realized it wasn’t just a matter of pride for her. Bannonwas cocky, believing he was a good fighter—which he was—but Lila was better. Thetwo of them fought well together, but she doubted he could survive without her.When he had plunged down the bluffside with King Grieve and Chalk, Lila thoughthe was dead, but after she survived her own fall and worked her way close enoughto spy on the slaves the Norukai had taken, she caught a glimpse of Bannon,unmistakable with his long ginger hair, his familiar body. Thus, she knew he wasstill alive, knew she still had a chance.For days after the city vanished, Lila prowled through the thickets, stayinghidden as she climbed over knobby roots and dangling vines, always watching theNorukai. She couldn’t fight thousands of them, no matter how much she mightenjoy it. She would have to be clever.Throughout the day, she crouched among the thorny shrubs as the sluggish riverlapped along the muddy shore. Bloodthirsty biting insects buzzed around herface. Even after the damage their navy had suffered, Lila could see that withall their furious work, the raiders would have several serpent ships repairedsoon. She would have to think bigger.Lila worked her way to the base of the bluffs, where she found the ruins of theIldakaran docks, splintered boards, anchoring posts, all of which had beensmashed when the Norukai warships arrived. Overhead, she saw only the remnantsof sheared-off tunnels in the cliffs that now went nowhere.She caught a glint of sunlight on steel among the dock boards and brokenbranches against the rocks. She hunched in the shadows until she was sure of hercamouflage, then slipped forward to see what the object might be.It was a plain, leather-wrapped hilt. She moved the broken dock boards aside,careful to make no noise, and found a sword, an unimpressive blade that hadfallen from the cliffs above. She pulled it loose from the mud, splashed wateron the blade and cross guard to reveal the discolored metal. This was not anornate sword, but it was serviceable. She recognized the weapon—Bannon’s sword,Sturdy.The edge was still sharp, and she knew that this was a better blade than any shecould have wished for—and appropriate, too. Now she was armed, and she wouldfind a way to save Bannon, even if she had to take on the entire Norukai fleet."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 [part0003.html#a7]Wizard Commander Maxim looked beautiful. Adessa held up his head, wrapped herfingers in his spiky dark hair. His dead face sparked a thrill of satisfactionthat flowed through Adessa like warm honey.Maxim’s decapitated body lay sprawled in the dirt in front of the cottage. Ribspoked out like broken twigs from his smashed chest. Wind rushed through theboughs of the surrounding dark spruce trees like whispered cheers. The morazethleader raised the head in front of her face in the moonlight.The wizard commander had been so handsome once, the haughty leader of Ildakar,but now his face was slack, his lids like loose fleshy flaps covering his eyes.His mouth hung open, and blood dribbled down into his goatee. Gore glistened onthe stump of his neck.After she sprang her trap, the man would have perished soon enough from hissmashed chest, but Adessa didn’t want Maxim to die on his own. The Keeper wouldhave him one way or the other, so she had hacked through his neck and lifted upthe head in triumph.“My mission is complete.” Adessa’s voice was a hard whisper, muffled by thestirring spruce trees around the cottage. “I always knew I would kill you, butyou were too arrogant to believe it yourself.”The dead wizard commander did not respond, but his slack cheek muscle twitched,startling her with the unexpected movement. Maxim’s mouth fell open wider as hisjaw muscles relaxed in death.Adessa drew a deep breath. She had done as Sovrena Thora commanded. Finally, shecould go home to Ildakar.Wizard Commander Maxim had betrayed Ildakar by creating unrest among the lowerclasses, provoking a revolt—just because he was bored! Such betrayal wasunthinkable to Adessa. She and her fellow morazeth were utterly loyal to theircity and to the wizards’ duma.On the night of the uprising, when mobs killed their masters and destroyedthousands of years of the sovrena’s perfect society, Maxim had fled the citylaughing. As the chaos continued to build, Thora had sent Adessa after thewizard commander with instructions to hunt him down and bring back his head as atrophy. For many days, weeks, she had tracked the man through the swamps, downthe Killraven River, until finally trapping him here at this isolated cottage.She recalled the delicious impact of her sword against his neck, the crunch asshe cut through his spine. A shiver went down her back as she thought of it now.With her highly attuned reflexes, she whirled at the sound of a crackle likemelting ice. Pale statues stood just at the edge of the cottage’s garden: abroad-chested man in patched clothes, and his wife with her hair bound in ascarf, her wide hips covered by a patchwork skirt. Three children were by them:a young girl of about five, a boy of eight, and an older boy of eleven ortwelve. The petrified figures began to move sluggishly, inhaling deep breaths asthey came alive again. Confused, the family bent their arms in wonder.Adessa relaxed. She should have expected this would happen once she killedMaxim. The Farrier family lived in this cottage in the forested hills above theriver town. Apparently, the kindly people had welcomed the wizard commander andoffered him shelter, but when they tried to flee, he had turned them all intostatues. Now that the wizard commander was dead, his petrification spell hadworn off.Their skin softened and flushed with color again. In the minds of theseterrified people, they had been running into the night, terrorized by Maxim,when their existence had suddenly stopped. Now, like a snapped string, it was adifferent night sometime in the future, and everything had changed. They didn’teven know how many days had passed or what had happened in the world.And there was a bloody woman standing before them with a severed head in herhand.The little girl screamed. The disoriented mother grabbed her youngest children.The father stood next to his older son, ready to defend his family.Adessa realized that she must look a horrific sight, a muscular woman clad onlyin black leather, her skin covered with branded runes. She lowered the head andspoke in raspy words: “You no longer need to fear the wizard commander. He isdead.” She looked down at the head she clutched in her left hand. “You are safenow.”The family stared at her with wide eyes, then looked at the headless bodysprawled on the ground among the dry spruce needles.She said, “I am Adessa, the morazeth leader from Ildakar. I was sent to killMaxim, and I succeeded in my task.”The parents and children clung together, afraid to move, though they clearlywanted to run like skittish deer. Adessa made no threatening gestures. “I am nodanger to you. The wizard commander can no longer hurt you.” She turned to thelittle girl, saw the fearful face soften into fascination as she fixated on thedripping head. “I need to take my trophy back to Ildakar.”Though the father was still wary, his shoulders relaxed. He put his arm aroundhis wife. “If you killed that awful man, then you saved us.”“What happened to us?” the wife asked. Her face was lined with wrinkles, thoughshe seemed rather young. “We slipped out of the house at night, hoping to getour children to safety while Maxim was sleeping. We were going to run to theriver town and beg for help.”“He turned you to stone,” Adessa said. “You had no chance against his spell.”The eleven-year-old boy said, “I remember running. I turned around and saw himcome out of the cottage. I tried to shout a warning, but—” He swallowed hard.“We were statues?” the father asked. “Just stone figures standing out here underthe trees?”“And now you are whole again,” Adessa said. “You can live your normal lives.”Unceremoniously, she kicked the headless body at her feet. “I tracked him here.I set a trap.” She turned to look at the heavy tree trunk still dangling onropes; it had swung down like a murderous pendulum to smash him in the chest. “Iused a bent sapling, that fallen log, some rope. He focused on me because hethought I alone was the threat. . . .” Her stiff face fostered a grim smile.“Now you are safe.”The Farrier family moved uncertainly around the headless body, running back totheir cottage. The father hurried his children ahead of him. The mother said,“We should thank you. Is there anything we can do for you?”Adessa stood with her feet planted in place. “I have a long journey back toIldakar so that I can deliver the trophy, as I promised.”Standing at the cottage doorway, the husband said, “Come in and eat with us.We’ll provide a meal so you will be strong for the journey.”The mother said in a harsh whisper to her husband, “Your naive heart andhospitality caused us enough trouble already!”“It’ll be fine,” he whispered back. “She killed the bad man.”Adessa just wanted to be on her way, but she realized she was in no hurry now.Maxim was dead. Suddenly she felt weary. Hunting the wizard commander had givenher a clear purpose, and she had endured so many hardships to achieve that goal.Now her guiding light had winked out. But her mission wasn’t finished until shedelivered his head to the sovrena. She would be foolish to refuse the offer ofsustenance, which would help her run farther and faster. “Yes, I accept yourfood.”Still carrying the repugnant head, she followed the family into the cottage.“Must you bring that inside?” asked the mother, horrified.“Yes. I must.”While the children looked uneasily at Adessa, the father lit candles and built afire in the stone-lined hearth. Soon, the interior was bathed in warm,comforting light.The younger children ran to their beds, huddling together. The older brotherstood uncertainly beside his father, while the mother moved about the kitchen,opening the larder to see what they had left to eat. She sighed in dismay. “Thatman ate most of our supplies. I have part of a ham, smoked catfish, and somecheese.” She scrutinized a rock-hard heel of bread. “This is old and stale.”“I will eat it,” Adessa said. “I don’t know how long Wizard Commander Maximlived here alone, but he would never deign to bake his own bread.”“I might find a chicken in the yard, wring its neck,” the father suggested.“We’ll have a proper feast, if you’re willing to wait.”Adessa considered, but shook her head. “I need to be on my way.”Though he had felt obligated to make the offer, the man seemed relieved when shedeclined.The mother set out whatever food she could scrounge and called the children fromtheir beds to the wooden table. Adessa set the severed head on the corner nextto where she would eat.The father regarded her awkwardly. “I have water from the cistern. You can washbefore you eat. You have . . . blood on you.”Adessa looked at her bare skin, at the scarred designs that had been burned byhot irons as she earned each rune of protection. Maxim’s blood covered her armsand abdomen, and rusty red flecks caked the black leather band around her chest.The speckles made mysterious patterns, drying to form a meaning, a message thatshe couldn’t understand. “The blood of my victim is a mark of honor. Why would Iwash it off?”The mother quickly sliced the ham, fish, and cheese, and they shared cups ofwater, though the conversation was awkward. Adessa ate ravenously, paying littleattention to the taste as she absorbed the nourishment she required. Now thatthe wizard commander was dead, she tried to feel the remnants of the blood magicinside her, but she had used it all. Her unborn child had given her the magicalstrength she needed to kill a powerful wizard, and now she was back to hernormal self—and her normal self was powerful indeed.The family ate in nervous silence, unable to look away from the gruesome headresting on the corner of their table. The neck stump left a rusty stain on thewood. From now on, whenever they looked at the mark, the Farrier family wouldremember her.“You can bury his body out in the yard,” she said after finishing the stale lumpof bread she had promised to eat.The father stared at her, then nodded. “We will get rid of it.”The younger children whimpered.Adessa wolfed down her food. “I must be moving now.” She gulped the last of thewater in her cup. “I have many miles to travel upriver.”“We’ll help you be on your way,” the father blurted out a little too quickly,though it was still many hours before dawn. “Can we give you supplies? What doyou need for your journey?”The mother offered, “There’s more in Gant’s Ford. Down in the town you can stockup on any provisions you require.”“I need little.” Adessa checked her weapons, the dagger and short sword she hadbrought from Ildakar, the morazeth agile knife clipped to her side, which couldbring such intense pain with just a touch. As she lifted Maxim’s head by thehair, she reconsidered. “There is one thing you could give me. I need a sack.”The mother scurried about the kitchen until she produced an empty burlap sackthat had been filled with millet. Adessa thanked her and stuffed Maxim’s headinside, twisted the end around her wrist, and turned to the door of the cottage.“I will be on my way.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [part0003.html#a7]The strange, shadowy people in Orogang closed around Nicci with outstretchedhands, as if they intended to overwhelm her by sheer force of numbers. Theyrustled as they moved, unnaturally quiet.When she reached out for her gift, she struggled with a wave of unsettlingnausea that lingered inside her from the abortive sliph journey. The silverycreature had damaged her somehow, maybe accidentally, maybe intentionally. Wherewas the sliph? Nicci needed to go!As the strange, muttering people closed in, she drew her two daggers and heldthem out in a threatening gesture. “I have no quarrel with you, but I willdefend myself.” She backed to the base of the towering Utros statue. “I don’twant to kill you.”One of the hooded figures cried out in gibberish, some dialect Nicci didn’tunderstand. More voices joined in, sounding frantic. Another spoke in slurred,deeply accented words that sounded like, “Take her! Not much time.” The peoplecarried no weapons, no swords or knives, not even sticks or clubs, but theirnumbers had doubled into an alarming force in just a few moments. They closed inon her.A third voice was more agitated. “Sun is rising! Hide.”Facing them, Nicci slashed the air with her daggers to ward them off. As dawnbrightened over the mountain crags, the strange people grew desperate. Severalmore of the shadowy people emerged, waving antique-looking swords. They howled,a sound of deep alarm. As Death’s Mistress, Nicci would have had no qualmssimply incinerating them all with a wash of wizard’s fire, but these gaunt,scuttling figures were obviously frightened of something. Right now her commandof magic seemed uncertain, yet it was her best way to drive away so many withoutmassacring them.She thrust one dagger back into its sheath and extended her arm, palm outward.Despite the throbbing in her head, she called up her gift and formed a wall ofair as a defense. The invisible battering ram knocked aside five encroachingstrangers, and they tumbled back into their fellows, but the crowd closed infrom opposite directions. Their voices became more understandable, though itremained a distorted dialect.“Take her! Inside the buildings!”“Hurry! The sunlight!”Though she reeled, weak and dizzy, Nicci found enough strength to blast with airagain, shoving more of the people away from her. Hands grabbed her shouldersfrom behind. Four of the silent strangers had climbed over the base of the Utrosstatue to attack her from an unexpected side. They jumped on her, tried to dragher down. The drab people fell upon her like wolves on a wounded deer.She spun, used her gift to form a circular whirlwind that shoved them all away.“Stay back!” Lashing out, she stabbed her dagger between the ribs of a gauntwoman, who collapsed, bleeding onto the statue general’s feet. Othersimmediately whisked the injured victim away and took her to one of thebuildings. The dark, open doorways looked like toothless mouths.Her eyes flashed from target to target as the mob hesitated but pressed in,looking for any opening. Why did they want her so badly? Nicci decided the timefor patience was over, and she couldn’t allow herself softness or sympathy. Sheconcentrated on the hardness inside her, the heart of black ice that was Nicci’sstrength when emotions were a vulnerability. It was her shield against love,although Richard had taught her that love itself could be a different kind ofstrength. Through him, Nicci had learned a new respect for helping people andfighting for a greater good, but she couldn’t forget her other strengths.As the desperate hands reached out to grab her, she called up her gift, ready torelease more destructive magic. “Leave me alone, or you will all die.”“All die!” shouted a man in the crowd. “The zhiss can’t have her!” They pushedforward as if it were a rallying cry.Nicci called a band of lightning from the sky to blast the flagstones of theplaza, a clear warning. It shattered a long furrow and hurled four of thegray-robed people aside. She whirled in her black dress, ready for the nextfoolish challenger. She would drive them all away. As the daylight brightened,she could see their expressions, which were oddly fearful and yearning, notbloodthirsty. That gave her pause again. Did she really need to kill them?“Take her!” shouted one woman. “Hurry.”The people surged forward as if they’d already forgotten the powers Nicci hadjust demonstrated, and she was forced to blast another dozen with a second boltof lightning. But the hooded people didn’t seem to care; they only wanted tocapture her.Several surprised her by throwing a crudely woven net over her from behind.Weighted with stones, the net drove Nicci to her knees, but she hunched her backand released a burst of heat that incinerated the tangled strands. She rose backto her feet, brushing off strings of ashes.Striking out with greater power, Nicci made the ground tremble, loosening theflagstones and shifting the earth. An ornamental pillar on the other side of thesquare toppled. She flung out her hand and pushed a wall of wind into the crowd,but they came at her from different sides. There were so many people. So many!When Nicci had fought Sulachan’s swarms of half people, with their blank,bloodthirsty eyes, she never once felt a flicker of doubt, never saw them asanything but inhuman. But these gray-robed strangers had a different emotion intheir eyes. It was not a hunger, but rather a need, a sadness.“I don’t want to kill you. Why are you doing this?” She held her bloody daggerin one hand, her other palm outstretched as she called up more of her gift. Shestill had plenty of fight left within her, but she was definitely feelingweaker. She needed to rest and recuperate after the disruptive journey throughthe sliph.A man tackled her from behind, but Nicci reached out to crush the man’s throatwith her gift, then cast his heavy body aside. She could no longer use a velvettouch if they were attacking her. More and more of them swarmed all around herand crowded in, unafraid. Growing more angry, Nicci blasted them, hurling bodiesin all directions. She had warned them many times, but it was as effective asstanding on the seashore kicking at the waves.Someone seized her wrist, making her drop the dagger. “We have to take you!” theshrouded man urged. “Stop fighting!”Another attacker struck Nicci on the back of the head, and a red blur flashedthrough her skull. She heard shouts and excited whispers, terrified groans.Dozens of hands grabbed her arms, her legs, picking her up and carrying heraway. Stunned, Nicci realized they were taking her toward the towering palacethat loomed over the great plaza.She struggled for consciousness, tried to reach for her gift, but her ears wereringing. With a cry, Nicci unleashed an instinctive, barely controlled surge ofmagic and seared two of her handlers. They stumbled back, their hands smoking,but others kept whisking her along. Nicci thrashed.“The sun’s cleared the horizon,” someone yelled. “Hurry!”Outside in the open square, as dawn washed away the gloom, the frenetic peopledisappeared like beetles scattering from beneath an overturned rock. They rushedto different buildings and ducked inside the dark interiors. As she fought tobreak free, she heard doors slam around the plaza, the heavy thunk of crossbarssealing them inside. The attacking mob dissipated like smoke in a heavy wind.The grip on her arms and legs was like iron as her captors rushed her throughthe arched doorway into the building. She was engulfed by shadows. Forging heranger into strength, Nicci fought with renewed vigor, scratching, punching.“Don’t make me kill you!”“Come with us!”Feeling wet blood in her hair from where she’d been struck on the head, Niccicould no longer afford mercy. She crashed the people away with a surge of magic,and dropped to the floor in the enclosed foyer, free. Lurching to her feet, shecalled a more powerful weapon, a sphere of wizard’s fire, which she tossed intothe crowded corridor just inside the entrance. She had to get these people awayfrom her. Deadly flames carved through eight attackers, and she smelled roastingflesh and burning hair. The charred corpses slammed against the wall andcrumpled onto the floor. Fires from burning bodies illuminated the shadowsinside the palace entry.Nicci tore herself free from the last clinging hands and turned to rush backinto the open plaza, but one old woman in a gray robe scuttled forward, blockingher way. Her wrinkled face held a beseeching expression. Her words were heavilyaccented, but understandable. “Stop! We’re trying to save you!” Nicci’s blueeyes flared with angry questions, but the woman urged, “Don’t go out there.You’ll die. We’ll all die. Please!”Outside, a golden sunrise lit the city of Orogang. Razor-edged shadows spreadacross the ground, and the distorted silhouette of the General Utros statuestretched over the flagstones. The ancient city again looked entirely abandoned.Nicci knew that if she got outside, these people couldn’t pursue her. For somereason, they were terrified of the sun.She faced them by the door, breathing hard from the effort she had expended. “Idon’t know who you are or what you mean to do. Why did you attack me?”“We were saving you!” The old woman clutched her hands together. “It was foryour own protection.”Other drab figures staggered forward, ignoring the still-burning corpses oftheir fallen comrades. “The zhiss are coming! You have to stay inside.”“We’ll kill you before we let them have you.”“Who am I to you?” Nicci demanded. “What are you talking about?”The old woman approached more guardedly. “Watch from the safe shadows, but wemust bolt the door. If we let the zhiss have you, if we let them feed on freshblood . . .” Her words trailed off, as if completing her sentence was tooterrifying to imagine.The pale people fell into quiet muttering, covered by a blanket of fear. Niccirealized they were not afraid of her, and she found that quite disturbing. Sheturned to face the brightening day, saw the empty city.Outside, following the golden morning light as if summoned by the rising sun, anominous black mist rolled in like a living thing. Hugging the ground, it wasmade of thousands of flecks, tiny shards of darkness, like a swarm of ebonylocusts. The black miasma flickered and sparkled with inky shadows, extendingtendrils and exploring as it crept into the ruins of Orogang.Nicci felt an evil danger that vibrated to her bones. “By the Keeper, what isthat?”“The zhiss,” said the old woman.The expanding black cloud crawled into Orogang like a deadly plague, and thehidden people shuddered in terror."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [part0003.html#a7]We can do only so much,” Nathan said, “but, dear spirits, we can do something.”The group had retreated deeper into the forest, where they continued to monitorthe enormous enemy army.Sitting on a moss-covered log, Prelate Verna looked determined, as if she hadworked a spell on herself. Her blouse and travel skirts were frayed and dirtyafter her long journey. She turned to the Sisters of the Light and the Cliffwallscholars who accompanied them. “When the enemy looks too large, focus on smallvictories, and we will defeat General Utros one step at a time.”The two morazeth flashed each other a determined grin. Thorn said, “Eachskirmish is an opportunity for us to pick off more of them.”Lyesse nodded. “A hundred at a time, then another hundred, then a thousand.Eventually we will make a difference.”“I applaud your confidence, ladies,” Nathan said. “You are as deadly as you areattractive.”“We work hard at both,” Thorn said with a sniff. She had short black hair, heavyeyebrows, and rich brown eyes. Nathan saw very little softness about her, notthat he expected to.He brushed a fly from his silk sleeve, then looked at the band of defenders.“You all saw it. The soldiers we killed were fully human, not half stone. If thepetrification spell has worn off, they will be easier for us to kill.”“And, they will be hungry,” General Zimmer pointed out. “With Ildakar gone, theycannot raid the city for supplies. More than a hundred thousand soldiers,entirely cut off. Therefore, they will have to raid every village and town theycan find.”“We can’t leave those places defenseless!” Amber said in alarm.“We have to seek out and warn any nearby villages, prepare them for what’scoming.” Nathan raised his chin and gestured to the group. “We can move fasterthan any scouting expeditions.”The wizard Renn came up to them, fidgeting. “From old records we, uh, have abasic idea of the towns in the area, though few gifted nobles ever exploredbeyond the city walls.” After so many days out in the wilderness, he looked likea horse that had been left out in the rain without being tended. “We didn’t paymuch attention to poor, primitive villages when we had all of Ildakar.”“Utros will want whatever towns he can find,” Zimmer said. “He will strip thembare. It is the obvious move.”Captain Trevor glanced at his remaining city guards, who stood together underthe tall, dark pines. Their uniforms were tattered and frayed, but they remainedloyal to a city that no longer existed. “Once the shroud of eternity came downyears ago, Wizard Commander Maxim dispatched scouting parties. He wanted to knowabout the outside world. I remember reviewing the reports. I can recall some ofthe nearest towns, so we can find them before Utros does.” Trevor bent to scrapeforest mulch from a patch of flat dirt, then used the point of his belt daggerto sketch out the general landforms around Ildakar, marking where the prominenttowns would be.Zimmer stood over the map, getting his bearings. “We should split up intoseveral parties in order to spread the word as swiftly as possible.”Verna added, “Utros has thousands of mouths to feed and no resources. Starvationmight kill more of them than swords would.”“I like killing them with my blade,” Thorn said, touching the hilt of her shortsword.“You’ll have ample opportunity, my dear,” Nathan replied. “Don’t worry.”*Once the separate groups chose which settlements to track down, the defenderssplit up and departed from their hiding place in the forest. Renn asked toaccompany Nathan, and the two gifted wizards set out in search of a town calledHanavir.Beneath his gold-trimmed white robe, Nathan still wore black travel pants, awhite ruffled shirt, and black leather boots. He considered himself both awizard and an adventurer. He carried his ornate sword, should he find himself ina more traditional battle.Renn walked beside him through the forests and over the hills. He had shaggybrown hair that he had once kept in well-maintained ringlets; his chin wascovered with stubble and his eyes were red. Despite the harrowing retreat fromIldakar, Nathan still made a point of maintaining his own appearance, using asharp knife to shave his chin and taking advantage of his gift, or just streamwater, to scrub stains from his silk robes. Renn, though, was broken and weary,no longer interested in how he looked. Sadness had knocked him off his feet.“I wanted a chance to talk to you,” Renn said as they followed a game path.Nathan lifted a low branch, and the other wizard ducked under it withoutnoticing. “When I left Ildakar to find Cliffwall, Lani was still just a statue.”He heaved a deep breath, looking down at the ground. “She was so beautiful, evenin stone. I would come into the ruling tower when it was empty just so I couldlook at her.” He held out his hand, wistfully studying it. “Sometimes I’d strokeher cold, hard face and remember kissing her.”Nathan had been impressed by Lani, too, for the brief time he had known her. “Iknow she loved you. I recall how determined she was.”Renn let out a sigh. “I wish I’d been there at her brave end. I could haveprotected her.”Nathan placed a hand on the other wizard’s shoulder. “I know you think that, myfriend, but I was there, as were Quentin and dear Elsa. Ava and Ruva turned thescrying magic against Lani so fast that she was dead before we could doanything.”Tears brimmed in Renn’s bloodshot eyes. “I still should have been there. Atleast I could have held her one last time.”Nathan felt a lump in his throat, feeling a similar pain. “Elsa used her lastmagic to fling me and the rest of us to a safe distance before she activated herspell. I couldn’t save her either.” He set his shoulders. “But there’s one thingwe can do to make up for it. We can do our part to save the rest of the world.”After hours of moving through the trackless hills, they stumbled upon a wagonroad. With a lighter step, the two wizards picked up their pace. Soon, they sawoutlying dwellings, grazing sheep, old apple orchards. A larger cluster ofhomes, barns, and shops formed a bustling town. Nathan spotted grain silos,storage sheds, smokehouses. People tended gardens in the yards; a man rode in amule-drawn wagon.“That must be Hanavir,” Renn said.The townspeople greeted them, not at all shy about strangers. Nathan called out,“We come to deliver a warning. This town is a target. A great army is coming tostrip you of all your supplies, possibly kill your people. You need to prepare.”An old man came forward, walking with a limp. He had a square face and thickgray hair matched by a thick gray beard. “That is quite an odd way to introduceyourselves, gentlemen. I am the mayor of Hanavir.”“We, uh, thought you’d appreciate the warning,” Renn said. “The army of GeneralUtros has awakened. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are about to sweep acrossthe Old World.”“And they need supplies,” Nathan continued. “They’ve dispatched raiding parties,and they will find Hanavir. They’ll take everything you have.”“But we have very little.” The mayor looked more confused than alarmed.Nathan snorted. “With full bellies and quiet lives, you may not realize how muchyou have. This town has plenty to plunder.”“But we’ve never been troubled before,” said a cartwright who stood in front ofhis shop.“There’s always a first time,” Nathan said.The mayor politely suggested they gather for a large meal to discuss the matterfurther. Though his mouth watered at the thought of well-prepared food, Nathanfelt impatient with the casual attitude. He looked around, noting the granaries,the storehouses, the butcher shop, the smokehouse. “We need to get started rightaway. Take your supplies to caches in caves or bury them in the forest where noone can find them. Move your sheep from the meadows. Otherwise the raiders willtake everything.”The mayor clucked his tongue as he hobbled along. “We need to call a meeting sowe can discuss this disruption. Do you have any proof that this great army iscoming here? We shouldn’t be too hasty.”Exasperated, Renn held his hands up in the air. “By the Keeper’s beard, Ildakaris gone, and General Utros is on the move! That’s why we came to warn you.”Nathan saw that Hanavir had been complacent for too long, never expecting anycrisis. Unfortunately, he didn’t have time to convince the people beforehoofbeats pounded along the wagon road leading into town. A raiding party ofseveral hundred soldiers came forward, raising a cloud of dust. They were cladin antique armor that bore the flame symbol of Emperor Kurgan. As the raidersgalloped into town, the mayor and his people let out a chorus of alarm. Panickedparents grabbed their children and ran to lock themselves in their houses, whileothers hurried to seize any weapon.Nathan recognized First Commander Enoch leading the soldiers. The old veteransat tall in his saddle, and one of the twin sorceresses rode on a bay marebeside him, her body covered with swirls of black and crimson paint. She wasexotic, beautiful, and deadly.As the fearful townspeople watched, Enoch raised his voice. “In the name ofGeneral Utros, we require your food and supplies. We will confiscate your grain,your flocks, your meat, your bread. We will take your wagons for transport.”“We’ll starve!” cried the mayor.“And we will not,” Enoch said. “Our soldiers need it more than you do.”Beside him the sorceress curled her lips in a thin smile.The two wizards worked their way through the crowded townspeople, coming intoview. Nathan felt his gift rising inside, ready to be released. “I’m afraidwe’ll have to stop you, First Commander.”Enoch recognized the wizard from their very first parley with General Utros.Next to him, with a look of delight and hunger, the sorceress laughed out loud.“I know you, old man. Nathan, isn’t it?”“I may have lived a thousand years, but I am not old,” he retorted. “Which oneare you, Ava or Ruva? I thought you twins were inseparable.”“We were separated by a knife when we were young,” she said, unconsciouslytouching a long scar on the outside of her bare leg, “but we are stillconnected. I am Ruva.”Renn’s face twisted in anger as he called on his gift. “You killed Lani!” Hestretched out his fingers and hurled a lightning bolt at the sorceress. Thejagged lance of energy made a searing pop, but Ruva deflected the bolt with ashield, and the whistling explosion struck the ground near her mare’s fronthooves. The horse reared, but the woman knotted her fingers in the mane to holdon.She retaliated with a rippling wave of hot air, and Nathan barely raised his ownshield in time. Her attack was ragged, and scattered fringes of heat knockeddown the limping old mayor and several townspeople. Five hundred soldiers rodeinto the town behind Enoch, and outriders chased the surprised villagers, whoscreamed and fled. The situation quickly got out of hand.Renn hurled walls of air against the ancient soldiers, but Nathan focused on hismain opponent, the sorceress. He crafted a ball of wizard’s fire and raised itto hurl at Ruva.First Commander Enoch sat tall in his saddle and bellowed, “Stop, Wizard—Icommand you!”Nathan shifted the ball of wizard’s fire and turned to the scarred veteran.“Since I can incinerate you in an instant, it is time for you to surrender. Tellyour soldiers to back off.”Enoch didn’t flinch. “On the contrary, you will cease your resistance.” Heraised his voice even louder and skewered Nathan with his steely eyes. “Or Iwill have my soldiers kill every last one of these villagers, and then we’lltake the supplies anyway. I have five hundred soldiers. You can fight us, evenkill many of us, but I’m confident we can slay every family in this town beforeyou stop us all—and you know I can do it.” His tone changed, sounding morereasonable. “Right now, we only want the supplies, but it could easily turn intoa massacre, if you force my hand.”The sounds of screams accompanied galloping hooves as the soldiers spread outamong the buildings, riding down the narrow streets. When the two wizardshesitated, looking at each other, Enoch shouted orders: “Men! Show them we meanbusiness!”The remorseless soldiers rode down mothers and their children, trampling them,hacking at shopkeepers and craftsmen who tried to defend their town. The peopleof Hanavir were not fighters, and the bloodshed was immediate and dramatic.Reacting together, Nathan and Renn bowled down the ancient warriors with wavesof wind, blocking part of the attack, but despite their efforts the widespreadslaughter continued across the town. Lightning strikes blasted five or sixsoldiers each time, but the raiders just rode harder, increased their mayhem.Hanavir was infested with enemies ransacking countless buildings. Two wizardscouldn’t possibly fight against five hundred bloodthirsty warriors dispersedamong the civilian population.“Halt!” Nathan cried, calling more wizard’s fire into his hand to threaten Enochdirectly. “I’ll incinerate you, First Commander.”The veteran just laughed at him from the saddle. “Then who will stop my men fromwreaking havoc throughout the town? Or, I can call them off now—if youcapitulate.” His words were quieter than the screams and the clashing blades.Several homes and shops were already on fire as the raiders cast torches. Hereiterated in a hard but reasonable voice, “All we want is the food. The peopledon’t need to die. But if you force us to burn the village to the ground, thatguilt is on your shoulders.”Nathan struggled to find some other solution, and a dozen more people diedduring his brief pause. A wailing young girl ran to her mother just before asoldier killed them both, and they died in each other’s arms.“Stop!” Renn wailed. “Please stop!”Ruva returned his poisonous gaze. “I can fight both of you if you like. I’d loveto pull the bones one by one from your skin.”Though he ached to save Hanavir, Nathan couldn’t battle the entire army on sucha widespread front. How many villagers would die in the meantime?The soldiers had rounded up a hundred panicked men and women, including the oldmayor, all of whom raised their hands in surrender. The soldiers lifted theirswords for a mass execution, and Enoch turned to Nathan and Renn, raising hishand, ready to give a signal.“Stop!” Nathan groaned. “Don’t kill any more of them.”“Then cease your resistance,” Enoch said. “Now.”“Give the order,” Renn cried as the screams continued. “Tell them to stopkilling!”The first commander waved his hand, and shouts went up and down the line.“Enough bloodshed for now! We need workers to load the supplies.” He snorted.“Do not make this any more difficult than it has to be.”Furious, feeling like a failure, Nathan struggled to contain his gift, knowingthat if he unleashed his magic, Enoch would retaliate with a vengeful massacre.He wanted to incinerate the old veteran the moment he saw an opportunity thatwouldn’t result in countless more deaths.“Take the wizards back with us,” Ruva said, sitting proudly on her mare.“General Utros will love having them as prisoners. My sister and I can dissectthem to find the magic inside.”Renn shouted, “I’ll kill both you and your sister. For Lani!”Nathan thought strategically, though. He whispered to Renn, “We don’t dare letthem capture us.”From the streets of Hanavir, he summoned the wind, manipulating it like a weaverwith fine silken threads. He pulled smoke from the burning buildings, dragged itcloser to them like thick and acrid curtains. Before Enoch could issue acommand, Nathan whipped the whirlwind of smoke around them, twirling it likepoisonous veils to camouflage himself and Renn. He grabbed the other man’smaroon sleeve. “Come, we have to run!”They darted through the streets as the smoke thickened, covering their retreatand leaving behind Ruva’s screams of rage at being cheated.Nathan’s heart was heavy because they had failed to save Hanavir. The twowizards themselves had barely escaped.He hoped the other parties were more successful."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [part0003.html#a7]After he endured another day of exhausting work on the river, seeing no chanceto escape, Bannon collapsed on the open deck near the bow of King Grieve’s ship.As night fell, stars began to sparkle overhead, but the new constellationsseemed very far away and unable to help him. Nevertheless, Bannon would fend forhimself and save as many of these people as he could. That was what he held onto.The other fifty or so slaves from Ildakar groaned and whimpered as they weretied or chained securely to the decks. In darkness, the swamp sounds grew louderas predators emerged from the muddy banks and thick underbrush.Though Bannon didn’t bemoan his circumstance, he felt determined and angry. Hisbeaten body was bruised, his muscles sore. Hunger clawed like a beast inside hisstomach. He knew the other slaves were in as much misery.After days of intense activity, many damaged ships had been partially repaired.The ruined hulks had been stripped bare, leaving only skeletons of wood. Mastsand yardarms were replaced, rigging ropes restrung, broken hulls patched, bilgespumped dry. Bannon had looked for opportunities to sabotage the repairs, and hehad left flaws in some of the vessels, but not enough to cause the disaster heneeded to inflict.Seven slaves had died so far during the work, and Bannon could tell that manyothers were ready to perish from sheer exhaustion. But he was in better shapethan these others. While held in the combat pits in Ildakar, Bannon had beentrained and toughened to fight; the rest of the Ildakar captives, though, hadled soft and prosperous lives. They wouldn’t last much longer as slaves of theNorukai.Impatient to launch his war, King Grieve took out his ire on his own people.That afternoon, he roared at Gara and two other shipwrights. “Faster! I needships now. We must sail back to the Norukai islands.”“Four will be ready and provisioned tonight, my king, my Grieve,” said Gara,cringing deferentially. Her braids flopped from side to side. “I promise.”Now, Bannon crouched on the deck with his wrists tied and ankles chained to ananchor bolt. Repairing the serpent ships was horrific work, but he knew hissituation would be worse once the raiding fleet set off down the river, takinghim and the other captives. After the serpent ships sailed away, Bannon couldnever find his way back to the site of Ildakar.His heart ached over the loss of the city, as well as his friends. Despite itsdark flaws and ugly secrets, Ildakar had great potential. With the overthrow ofSovrena Thora, it could have been a magnificent city again. Lila had wantedBannon to stay, but now she was gone, and his heart ached even more. He realizedhe didn’t just miss the young woman’s company as a protector and fighter. Shehad cared for him, guarded him at first out of a sense of duty, but it hadbecome more than that.Nathan was gone, too, but Bannon hoped the wizard was still alive. Now that hisgift was restored, no one would trifle with Nathan Rahl. And Nicci . . . she hadbeen cut off somewhere when Ildakar vanished.Bannon doubted he would see any of them again. He was trapped here alone,chained to the deck of a Norukai ship. “Sweet Sea Mother,” he mumbled. But hewould not surrender his optimism. There must be a way he could survive and helpdefeat the hated Norukai.As the deceptively soothing swamp noises grew louder, Bannon’s stomach growled.The slaves had to drink dirty river water from buckets. When some of them spewedthe water back up, the gruff Norukai would splash another bucket over theirfaces to wash away the vomit and keep the stink from lingering on the deck.In the thickening darkness, Bannon saw lanterns lit on the decks of the manyships lashed together in the current. Grieve’s ship and three others wereanchored together near the shore, ready to depart, and the king did not intendto wait. He would leave the rest of his fleet behind.Two Norukai men walked along the torchlit deck carrying a wooden tub betweenthem. They stopped at the first group of bound slaves and set down the heavytub. One man lifted a ladle that dripped a slurry of fish guts and river water.“Dinner!”The first slave turned his head away in disgust, but the Norukai dumped thecontents on the bound man’s face anyway. Wet entrails ran down his chin, andwhen the slave realized this was all the food he would get, he tried to slurpsome of the entrails. Learning the lesson, the next slave braced himself andopened his mouth, so the Norukai ladled the nauseating mess onto his face.Prancing behind the two men, Chalk hopped from one foot to the other.“Dinnertime, dinnertime! My fish, your fish!” He scooped a long-fingered handinto the wooden tub and rewarded himself with a fish head, which he tossed inthe air and caught with his mouth like a trained dog. Crunching down on thescales, he came closer to Bannon. “Fishes tried to eat me, and now I eat them!”In the light of the rising moon the puckered scars were prominent on his albinoskin. Bannon wondered what had happened to him, what the shaman had endured,what ordeal had created those scars and driven him to the edge of madness. “Theydidn’t eat enough of you,” Bannon said under his breath.Chalk hopped over to him and squatted down. “They ate just enough. Razorfishnibbled my arms, nibbled my legs, and nibbled between them.” He clamped a palmagainst his loincloth-covered crotch. “They took much away, but they gave mesomething, too.” He leaned so close to Bannon that the young man could smell therotting fish in his mouth. “That gave me my power! I see things. I know thefuture, the fire in the towns, the blood on the swords, so many screams. Butgood screams, I think.”“Are they the screams of dying Norukai?” Bannon asked, but the shaman seemedoblivious to his vitriol.Chalk cocked his head as if listening to whispered voices. “Yes, some of themare Norukai screams.” He sounded as if he was imparting a secret.The shaman seemed to find Bannon fascinating, as if he recognized that the youngman was different from the other Ildakaran captives. The two Norukai men settheir stinking wooden tub on the deck, and Bannon steeled himself. He raised hishead to accept the food, vowing to keep his strength for when he really neededit, but he nearly choked as they poured fish guts onto his face. He made himselfswallow.Squirming next to him, imitating Bannon, Chalk also turned his head up like ababy bird begging for a worm. The Norukai splashed the fish-gut soup across theshaman’s face, which satisfied him. He plucked a small fish head and held itbetween his thumb and forefinger. “You didn’t get a fish head. A special treat.”Before the young man could protest, Chalk popped the head between Bannon’s lips.He took it into his mouth, wincing as he swallowed the horrible morsel. Why wasthe albino paying so much attention to him?Drumbeats echoed from the stern of the serpent ship, and King Grieve stepped outinto the lantern light. All the people fell silent, slaves and Norukai. Grieve’svoice boomed out to all the nearby vessels. “These four serpent ships are readyto sail, and four is enough to spark terror as we proceed downriver. Tonight, wewill head back to the Bastion so we can begin this war.”Chalk leaped to his feet. “My Grieve, King Grieve! They’ll all grieve.”The king raised his heavy wooden baton and pounded the oar master’s drum again,louder than before. Guttural cheers resounded from hundreds of Norukai aboardthe other ships, which were in various states of repair.“We will raid villages as we make our way to the estuary and the open sea. Therest of our fleet is already gathering at the Norukai islands, and I must betheir king and warlord.” Offhandedly Grieve shouted across the water to theother vessels. “Finish repairs to the rest of the ships and sail back to us.” Heraised his iron-knuckled hand. The chain around his waist jingled as he spunabout and gave the order to raise the anchor. “These first ships will set off.Now!”Norukai sailors raised the midnight-blue sails on the four repaired ships,striking the ropes that lashed the hulls together.Bannon felt sick, knowing that once they sailed away from Ildakar with him andthis small group of slaves aboard, he would likely never escape. He gazedlongingly at the dense vegetation on the bank as he strained against his ropesand chains. He could think of no way to get off the ship, but he would keeplooking.*From her hiding place among the thorny reeds, Lila spied on the raider ships,knowing that some—including Bannon’s—were repaired and ready to depart. In thedarkness, she heard the drumbeats accompanied by distant gruff shouts, a voiceshe recognized as King Grieve’s.Lying in wait for days as the repairs continued, she had made her plans andcreated a booby trap. With all of the vines and trees along the river, shefashioned her tools, working quietly in the shadowy blanket of night. Hergreatest advantage was that the Norukai didn’t know she was here.She had dismissed dozens of different plans because they would surely end infailure. Lila could not let herself fail. If this were just for her sake, shewould have thrown caution to the wind and charged in with her weapons, confidentshe could kill a dozen or more Norukai before she died. But she had a greatercalling now. She needed to free Bannon.When the four repaired ships prepared to depart down the river, Lila vowed tostop them. Fortunately, she had worked for days, laying her trap. She used vinesto pull down the supple swamp trees, staging them, forming makeshift catapults.Her surreptitious work left her vulnerable to swamp dragons, large coiledsnakes, and hunting spiders the size of rats. Lila killed many of them, avoidedothers. Now everything was ready as she lay in wait.With the anchors raised and the dark sails set, the four serpent ships moved offinto the night. Lila knew she had only one chance.She wasn’t sure of her aim, since she’d been unable to test her crude catapults,so she had to rely on her guesses and her hope. Bannon was aboard King Grieve’sship, and she had to make sure she didn’t accidently kill him in her attack.With three resilient saplings tied down, Lila had gathered bunches of dry twigsand dead vines into flammable bales that could fly like projectiles. The benttrees were quivering and ready to launch, loaded with all the dry material. Whenthe ships began to move out, Lila struck her dagger against the flint shecarried in a pouch, lit a spark to ignite the first bale. As the flames caught,she ignited the bundle in the second catapult, then the third. She could smellthe sour odor of green wood burning.When her makeshift catapults held their blazing clumps, she slashed the ropeholding the first bent tree in place. With a groan, it sprang upright andreleased the bale of fiery wood, throwing a burning comet toward the Norukaiships. Lila cut the second rope to launch the next projectile. The ball of fireraged across the sky as the first bale struck one of the four ships—notBannon’s, she saw with some relief. The Norukai crew scrambled to extinguish theblaze before the ship could catch fire.The second bale whistled over the top of the next vessel, missing it andplunging into the river, where the flames spat as they were extinguished.The third projectile, though, crashed into the vessel just behind the flagship,and the flames spread as kindling scattered across the deck and caught in therigging. The Norukai rushed about to extinguish the flames, but the blazequickly got out of control. The vessel was engulfed in fire, a torch on theKillraven River.Fleeing the blaze before it could spread, the other three ships sailed away fromthe burning ship, while King Grieve and the Norukai shouted insults at theirunseen attacker on the riverbank.Lila emerged from the underbrush on the muddy shore to watch the mayhem she hadcaused. She smiled before ducking back into the shelter of the trees. The otherthree ships pulled away.*Neither King Grieve nor his crew could save the fiery wreck, so the flagshipraced away, gaining distance from the spreading sparks.Tied and chained onto the deck, Bannon could barely contain his joy as hewatched Norukai diving overboard to flee the burning vessel. He wondered who hadlaunched the catapults of fire that soared overhead like shooting stars. Someoneelse was fighting back! Someone else was still free out there! On the deck,several slaves laughed and cheered at this unexpected victory until theirNorukai masters cuffed them into senselessness.As they sailed away from the bluffs, Bannon kept watching the thickets, and hethought he saw a flash of skin, a lithe young woman. Could it be? Lila! Even asthe serpent ship sailed away, Bannon felt great joy just to know she was outthere."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [part0003.html#a7]From the sheltered stone doorway of the palace, Nicci watched the black cloudcreep into Orogang.“The zhiss . . .” said the old woman next to her, and a deep shiver lurked inher voice. The other shrouded people crowded together, more afraid of whateverwas out there than they were of Nicci. Some of them peeked out into thedaylight, while others retreated into the gloom of the windowless passageways.The sentient cloud swirled like a thunderstorm that had been shattered intoobsidian fragments. Each fleck was only the size of a biting black fly, andtogether they swirled in a shapeless predatory mass. A buzzing simmered in theair like a thousand beehives, and the sound grew louder as the mass driftedamong the abandoned buildings.“What are they?” Nicci whispered.“Death,” said the old woman. Behind her, in the gloom of the shuttered palace,the other people remained utterly silent.Tendrils of the black mass extended, probing, hunting. The zhiss had a purpose.From the doorway, Nicci spotted movement in the overgrown shrubs in the emptysquare. As the daylight brightened, the two foraging deer cropped tender greenvegetation. The doe pricked her ears and raised her head, while the young buckwith short velvety antlers continued to munch flowers, until he also sensed thebuzzing cloud.The zhiss moved toward the animals. Black specks tumbled, rotated, extended inan ill-defined tentacle that advanced like candle wax pouring down a slantedsurface. The uneasy animals skittered, but they didn’t understand the threat.From her sheltered overhang, Nicci wanted to shout at the deer and make themrun, but the old woman squeezed her shoulder like a vise. “Remain silent! Wedon’t dare call attention to ourselves.”The black cloud buzzed forward, expanding, then swooping down around the deer.Too late, the animals tried to bolt away, but one extension of the zhissblanketed them like countless bloodthirsty mosquitoes. Smothered, the deercollapsed on the flagstones. The poor animals twitched and thrashed, buteventually lay still.Before long, individual specks rose up like drunken bumblebees and drifted awayfrom their victims. Now, the tiny flecks were swollen globules the size ofgrapes, purplish red instead of black, engorged with blood. The rest of thecloud drifted and kept expanding, still hungry, still probing through theancient city for prey.Sickened by what she had seen, Nicci turned to the old woman, realizing whatthese strange people had done by capturing her. “You did save me.” She hadkilled so many of them! “You knew what was coming. If I had been out there whenthe sun rose . . .”“We saved you, and perhaps we saved the world,” the woman replied. “We could notlet them have you. The blood of a gifted sorceress is incredibly potent.”Nicci was frustrated that they had been unclear, that their muddled old dialectand their urgency had led to such tragedy, but they had been desperate to keepher away from the black cloud. Now their voices were loud in the silence, andthe zhiss detected the sound even from outside. Part of the swarm poured towardthe towering palace in which Nicci and the others hid. The furtive people letout a collective gasp and retreated deeper into the shadows. The old womanpushed the thick door shut, assisted by others. Nicci added the last nudge toslam the barrier in place just as the buzzing, swirling zhiss struck the blockystructure. Through the stone-hard wood, she could hear a vibrating hum as theangry force vented its frustration.With the door sealed, Nicci waited for her eyes to adjust to the light ofintermittent torches mounted on the stone walls. The people had covered everycrack and cranny, allowing no outside light and no speck of predatory blacknessto enter.The building was huge, an imposing palace with vaulted ceilings and enormouschambers larger than the torches could effectively illuminate. Hundreds of thepale people were crowded inside, far more than Nicci had expected. They all woregray, unobtrusive garments. Although they seemed healthy enough, the peoplelooked haunted.The clamor of questions became too loud in her mind. “Explain what is happeninghere,” she demanded. “What are the zhiss and who are you?”As the people muttered, the old woman pulled back her hood to reveal gray hairwith a few streaks of brown. Her skin was pale to the point of translucency,showing the faint lines of blood vessels. “I am Cora. We call ourselves theHidden People, for that is what we do—we hide.”“What do you accomplish by hiding? I rarely find that a useful strategy.”“We control the zhiss,” Cora replied. “We keep Orogang safe. We keep the worldsafe.”The people with her muttered more loudly. Nicci was glad to confirm hersuspicion. “So this is Orogang, the capital of Emperor Kurgan’s empire.”“What is left of it,” Cora said.A square-jawed man with a grim expression said, “Emperor Kurgan is long dead,destroyed by his vengeful people, but General Utros will return. That is whatthe old prophet said.” Nicci was surprised to hear the statement, but did notpoint out that the man’s desire might actually come true, though not in the wayshe expected. The man introduced himself as Cyrus.The old woman explained, “The city fell many centuries ago, after the peopleoverthrew Iron Fang. The populace longed to anoint General Utros as their nextemperor, and back then a crazed prophet insisted that Utros would come back toOrogang. But years passed, and he never returned. The empire fell into a civilwar. The people were busy fighting under different flags, breaking intofactions, paying little attention to anything but their own conflict.” She drewa deep breath. “Then the zhiss came.”“Utros will return!” Cyrus insisted.“I think we’ve waited long enough,” said a brown-haired young woman with a huff,drawing an annoyed glance from Cyrus.“What are the zhiss?” Nicci asked, interested in the true danger. “Where didthey come from?”The Hidden People stirred uneasily at hearing their own history, but let the oldwoman continue the tale. “A fiery star fell from the heavens and struck themountains. Inside, it carried the zhiss, like an egg sac filled with spiders.” Afrown settled into her deeply lined face. “They fed on the population. The zhisswere just a black wisp at first, but each time they consumed a human, the swarmmultiplied. The things used our blood to breed, and the cloud doubled anddoubled again. Some of us learned how to hide.” Cora closed her eyes, and in thedim torchlight Nicci could see tears glittering.Nicci considered. “But Kurgan fell fifteen hundred years ago. You cannot be thatold.” She remembered the preservation spells woven through the Palace of theProphets that prevented aging. Nicci herself was over one hundred and eightyyears old. “Or are you?”Cora shook her head. “No, that was generations ago, but we have stayed becausewe know our duty. We need to keep the zhiss here. If we leave, the cloud willseek out other villages, towns, cities, and then the zhiss will be unstoppable.”The young woman who had scoffed at Cyrus came closer, even managing a smile.“The swarm only comes out in daylight, so we are safe as long as we remainsealed in our buildings until dark.” The girl would have been pretty, aheartthrob for any young man, if she hadn’t been so pallid. “I am Asha. We goout at night to hunt and gather. We have stockpiles of food throughout the city,enough to last for decades, but we dare not leave Orogang.”“We wait,” Cyrus said. “We have our purpose.”“But the zhiss fed on those two deer,” Nicci said. “Won’t the swarm reproducenow?”Cora shook her head. “The zhiss sustain themselves with the blood of animals,but there is some quality in human blood that lets them reproduce.” The oldwoman lowered her voice. “And gifted blood is the most powerful of all.”Nicci realized the significance of how vulnerable she had been out in the ruins.“When you first saw me at night, how did you know I was a sorceress?”“We didn’t,” Cora said. “We just tried to save you, but when you fought backusing your gift, we knew it was imperative to get you inside, away from thezhiss, even if it cost the lives of many of our people. If the black cloud hadfed on you . . .” She let her words trail off, shuddering visibly.Nicci wondered if her gift would have been able to deflect the hungry blackswarm. She didn’t count on it.Old Cora continued her explanation. “And so we remain here and feed the swarmjust enough to keep it under control. It doesn’t wander away, but we cannotleave. Not ever.”“Unless we stop it somehow,” Asha interjected.Looking around inside the expansive foyer of the palace, Nicci frowned at theburned bodies of those she had killed with wizard’s fire while trying to avoidcapture.“I’m sorry I caused you so much harm,” she said again, tasting the regret in herthroat. “I didn’t understand what you were doing.”“We were not only doing it to save you,” Cyrus scoffed. “If the zhiss had fed onyour blood, our situation would have grown far worse.” He added an edge to hisvoice. “If we could not bring you inside the shelter in time, we would havekilled you.”Nicci faced him in the flickering torchlight. “You might have tried.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 [part0003.html#a7]Creeping through the trees, Verna and her companions searched for a smallmountain village, hoping to find it before the enemy raiders did. Thefresh-faced novice Amber accompanied her, as well as the morazeth Lyesse andfive of Zimmer’s D’Haran soldiers.Lord Oron stalked beside the prelate, hard-faced and unhappy with hiscircumstances. “I was once a respected member of the wizards’ duma, as well asthe head of the skinners’ guild. Now I am wandering through a trackless foresthoping to find a few hovels.”Ahead, they heard bleating sheep, and the trees opened up to reveal an expansivemeadow. A terrified flock was being driven down the grassy slope by thirtyarmored soldiers.Verna shot a glance at the powerful wizard from Ildakar. “And I was once theprelate of the Sisters of the Light. Now it appears we will both be shepherds.”Lyesse was already sprinting forward. “That is enough meat to feed many enemysoldiers. We cannot let them have the animals. Come, let’s stop them.”As Verna watched the aloof soldiers herding the sheep along, her voice came outin a low, husky growl. “At least we will make them pay for what they did to thatpoor shepherd’s family.”Only an hour earlier, they had smelled smoke and come upon a burning cottage ina high meadow, where they found the bodies of a woman and her daughter, bothwith their throats cut. The cottage had been stripped of supplies, all the foodeaten. Farther out in the grazing fields, they found a tent that held theshepherd and his teenage son, both also dead, along with their dog. The tent hadbeen set on fire, and the corpses were half burned. Now the ancient raiders weredriving the whole flock back to the main army.“It is only thirty soldiers,” said Lyesse, pausing to watch from the edge of thetrees. “Our swords will make quick work of them. I’d kill them all myself, butthen Thorn might not believe my score.” Her lips quirked in a smile as shelooked at the other D’Haran soldiers. “I will let my comrades have a turn aswell.”“The prelate and I also have a respectable amount of magic,” Oron pointed out.“We’ll take care of a few ourselves.”Out in the open meadow, the soldiers banged their swords on their flame-embossedshields to keep the sheep moving across the sloped grasses. They had no ideathey were being watched.The D’Haran soldiers drew their weapons and crouched, hiding in the forestcamouflage. A breeze stirred the branches, rustled the leaves. Lyesse grippedher short sword and looked over her shoulder at her companions. She raised herheavy dark eyebrows. “What are we waiting for?”Oron raised his hand and called upon his gift. “I’m not waiting.” The skydarkened over the meadow, and a sharp wind began to blow harder. The marauderslooked up, grumbling at the sudden afternoon thunderstorm. A single black cloudunleashed a downpour that fell only over the meadow, drenching them. Thebleating sheep kept moving.With a smile, Oron twisted his fingers, and a thin lightning bolt speared downinto the middle of the enemy soldiers, killing two and scattering the others. Interror, the sheep bolted in all directions.Prelate Verna and the others needed no further encouragement. Smiling, Amberused her own gift to summon a whirling whip of air that lashed out and caughtone of the enemy soldiers, knocking him over. He yelped in surprise.The D’Haran soldiers charged out of the forest, with the lean morazeth boundingahead of them. In the pelting rain and howling winds, the ancient soldiersdidn’t realize how few were attacking them.Thunder boomed from Oron’s black cloud. Another bolt of lightning shattered oneof the enemy warriors into chunks of charred flesh. Fleet as a jaguar, Lyesseleaped in among the startled soldiers. Swinging her short sword, she decapitatedone of the men, then gutted a second with her backstroke. “Two!” she cried, andfell upon more victims.Yelling, Verna ran after them. Amber followed her. “I’m at your side, Prelate.”Though Verna felt old and weary from the long journey, she was tough. She hadtrained many young wizards in the Palace of the Prophets, had even been able toenforce her will on Richard Rahl. She was a scholar, a leader, and powerfullygifted.And she had been to war before.Verna called up a pocket of air above the milling, frightened sheep, thencollapsed it, pressing her palms together. The snap of compressed air made anexplosion of sound, a harmless boom that sent the panicked sheep bolting intothe trees.She looked at Oron. “The raiders will never catch those sheep now.”The wizard gave a small nod. “Effective, Prelate, though I would rather kill theenemies, not just startle them.” He raised both hands, twisted his wrists, andchanged the magic he had released. The pouring rain froze into a wave of long,sharp ice projectiles that were like pointed arrowheads pelting the drenchedsoldiers. Then the D’Haran soldiers fell upon them.Utros’s raiding party had expected little resistance when they harassedundefended villages and an isolated shepherd’s family. Surprised, they were easytargets, and all of them were quickly and methodically dispatched.True to her word, Lyesse accounted for six of the enemy soldiers herself. ThreeD’Haran soldiers had been injured in the fray, and they all sat together undernow clear skies and bound each other’s wounds. Verna and Oron used their gift toheal the worst of their cuts.Before sunset, they made camp outside the damaged cottage. Two of the menretrieved the bodies of the shepherd and his son from their burned tent andbrought them back so the entire family could lie at rest next to one another.Verna and her companions took the time to give the poor victims a proper burial,which seemed fitting.“The Keeper took them too soon,” she said. “But at least they will all be afamily in the underworld.”In a hard voice Oron said, “The Keeper didn’t take the rest of the ancient armysoon enough. I’d like to send them all to the underworld.”It seemed fitting to leave the bodies of the ancient warriors to rot on thehillside.As night fell and the party built a fire outside to brighten the darkness,Lyesse trudged back across the meadow with one of the sheep over her shoulders,killed and gutted.“The rest of the flock is scattered,” she said. “This one will be enough for us,and Utros will get none of them.” She dropped the carcass near the fire, thenused her dagger to cut chunks of the richest meat for them to roast. “It hasbeen a good day.”“A good enough one,” Verna said. Though they had killed thirty of the enemy, sheknew there were countless more soldiers, and that thought weighed on her. Wasthis merely an exercise?But when she looked at Amber’s satisfied smile, she decided to let the noviceenjoy the victory. Verna promised herself that the war was not, in fact,insurmountable. There would be many defeats and setbacks before all was said anddone, but they had won this day, at least. . . ."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 [part0003.html#a7]The great army of General Utros consisted of as many tactical details as therewere soldiers. As the general planned the conquest of the Old World, hisgreatest challenges were administrative.In the late afternoon, he stood outside his pavilion and stared across thesweeping encampment, deep in thought as the sun lowered behind the mountains tothe west. His tactical mind was a complex series of turning wheels, one thoughtchanging another as he considered the consequences of his actions. He touchedthe gold mask that covered the left half of his face, a price he had been forcedto pay. Consequences . . .Although he understood his army’s dire situation better than any of his soldiersdid, he refused to let desperation press him into making another brash choice.He would plan his next move carefully, using his insights, experience, andstrategic knowledge. He listened to the camp sounds as his hungry troops settledfor the night. They gathered around communal bonfires to tell stories of theirlost loved ones or to play ancient gambling games.After the devastating setbacks—the mayhem of the titanic Ixax warriors, thereturn of the gray dragon, the fiery transference magic—his subcommanders hadreported the actual tally of losses only to Utros. He could not let the massesunderstand just how terrible a blow they had suffered, because his army mustnever learn that true defeat was possible.The bodies of the fallen were swiftly burned in funeral pyres to disguise thevast numbers of corpses. Also, so they would not feel the constant reminder oftheir fallen comrades, Utros reorganized his entire fighting force, reassigningthe surviving soldiers into new companies under new subcommanders, so they wouldnot immediately see how many comrades they had lost.The greatest blow, though, was the loss of Ildakar itself.Utros turned toward the end of the valley and the sheer drop-off to the riverlowlands. The whole city was gone, as if it had never existed. His explicitpurpose, burned into him by Emperor Kurgan so long ago, had been to conquerIldakar. That was the reason he and his vast army had marched through themountains down from Orogang, and now their primary goal had been snatched away.Utros knew he had little time. He pressed his mask against the hard scar of hischeek. The pain in the stripped side of his face sent twinges into his skull.For now, his men still had faith in him. They trusted their general, sworedeeper loyalty to him than they had ever felt toward Iron Fang. Utros would notlet them down, but he had to give them something to hold on to, some new hope,an attainable goal. He would rally them, fire their determination.Ava stepped out from the pavilion’s shade. She had applied black soot and darkred paint in incomprehensible designs over her breasts and flat stomach, thendonned her filmy blue gown. She was breathtakingly beautiful, like her twin, andshe was equally terrifying. She reached out to stroke his thick biceps. “Mysister is returning, beloved Utros.” Her touch lingered on the embossed designon his copper armband. “I sense her.”His gaze was drawn to the scar that ran along her outer thigh where her leg hadbeen fused with her sister’s at birth, before their father had hacked them apartas babies. Though they were physically separated, their Han remained connected.Ava gestured with her chin toward where a large party trotted out of thenorthern hills through the scorched grasses. Several hundred mounted soldiersled a train of wagons and pack mules loaded with sacks of grain and casks ofale, and they also drove sheep, cattle, goats, and a few yaxen. Even from adistance, Utros recognized First Commander Enoch and the pale, painted figure ofRuva at the front of the party.Groups at separate campfires let out cheers when they saw the supplies.Throughout the day, dozens of scattered raiding parties had returned withwhatever provisions they could liberate from villages or isolated homes in thehills. The trickle of food was enough to reassure the army, for now.Utros was confident none of his soldiers could complete the calculations of justhow many sacks of grain, how many cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, deer, or boar,were needed to feed more than a hundred thousand mouths. He had to find asolution before his army understood the magnitude of the problem.Utros retrieved his imposing helmet adorned with two curved horns from anabominable bull that the fleshmancers of Ildakar had sent against his army inthe early days.As the returning party rode through the cheering camp, Ava slipped her armthrough the general’s and strolled at his side, protecting him with her beautyas well as her powerful gift. Enoch and Ruva rode up to report to the general.His veteran subcommander had a grizzled, craggy face adorned with numerousbattle scars that gave him character. Enoch removed his helmet and wiped a palmover his bristly gray hair. “Our mission was a success, General.”“I can see that.” Utros watched the wagons move among the camped troops,distributing the commandeered supplies and meat animals to the companies. Utroslowered his voice. “The animals should all be slaughtered tonight. We don’t havethe means to feed and keep them. Give everyone a full meal.”Enoch looked grim. “This food won’t last long, sir.”“I’m aware of that. Did you have any difficulty?”Ruva answered with a strangely malicious smile. “No.”When Utros gave his first commander a curious look, Enoch explained, “The townof Hanavir had many supplies, but we encountered unexpected resistance.”“The townspeople fought back? Against five hundred armed warriors?”The old veteran shook his head. “No, there were two stray wizards. You rememberthe one with white hair known as Nathan Rahl?”Utros pressed his lips together. “Yes, he fancied himself a historian andinformed me that my name is legend.” He tasted the bitter sarcasm in his throat.“Nathan is also the one who told me of the fall of Emperor Kurgan. It was he whotold me what really happened to my dear Majel.” Bile rose in his throat everytime he thought of that sweet woman, how her own husband had skinned her aliveto get his revenge.The gold mask felt heavy on his face, and Utros adjusted it against hischeekbone. “But Nathan’s gift was gone, was it not? He seemed impotent as awizard. How did he fight you?”“His gift is back,” Ruva said. “He and one other wizard from Ildakar, a mannamed Renn, attempted to protect the town. But we defeated them.”Utros was pleased but perplexed. “You defeated two wizards? How?”“Compassion was their weakness,” Enoch said. “We couldn’t fight their giftdirectly, but we slew some innocent townspeople and threatened to kill them allif they did not relent. The two wizards escaped, and we took all the supplies.”With a haughty sniff, Ruva said, “We should have killed the townspeople anyway,just to punish them.”“Those were not my orders,” Enoch responded with a hint of anger. “My prioritywas to commandeer supplies to feed our troops, not to secure some pettyrevenge.”“It wouldn’t have taken long,” the sorceress said flippantly, but she deferred.They watched the carts being unloaded, so many soldiers dividing up thesupplies. Second Commanders Halders and Arros directed the activity.“The soldiers will follow orders until the hunger in their bellies convincesthem otherwise.” Utros shook his head. “We can’t just stay encamped in thisworthless valley. Ildakar is gone, as are all its supplies. There is no reasonto remain. Our army has to move, and soon.”“We have a continent to conquer,” Ava said.“We dare not let King Grieve have it all,” Ruva said.The thought made Utros ill. He looked across the valley. “We break camp at dawnand march westward at a swift, even brutal, pace. Our food will run out beforelong.” He lowered his voice. “When we were partly stone, our bellies were quiet.We did not appreciate the blessing that went hand in hand with that curse. Nowthis army must hold itself together long enough to cross over the mountains.”“You will hold the army together,” Ruva said.Utros couldn’t drive away the cold knot in his chest. In the past month he hadalready dispatched dozens of expeditionary armies with thousands of men to plantthe banner of Utros across the landscape. Now he would have to strip everyresource they could find just to keep the huge army moving.But he looked forward to the march."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 [part0003.html#a7]As Adessa moved up the riverbank on her long journey back to Ildakar, her onlycompany was Maxim’s severed head, which she carried in a bloody sack at herside. She traveled at a steady pace, without urgency, since the hunt was over.She had killed her prey, but her quest was not finished. She still had to bringthe trophy back home.Home. Adessa rarely let herself think such thoughts. As a morazeth, she gave herbody and her skills entirely to Ildakar. Adessa had no joys, no doubts, onlyservice. She would fight and defeat any opponent in the combat arena; she wouldkill any enemies of the city, even the wizard commander himself. She did notcount the cost in blood, nor did she celebrate the amount she spilled.Before she had killed Maxim, he’d taunted her that Ildakar might be under siegeby a Norukai war fleet. He also claimed to have broken the petrification spelland intentionally unleashed the gigantic army of General Utros. Adessa had noreason to believe this was true, since she also knew that the wizard commanderhad a habit of lying. Once she got back to the city, she would see the truth forherself, and fight if necessary.As she moved mile after mile, Adessa anticipated seeing the glorious city, thearbor-lined streets, the ruling tower and the sacrificial pyramid, the combatarena soaked with blood and glory. Adessa had trained so many fighters, andsome, like Ian, even became champions, a rare honor. She had also allowed Ian tobecome her lover, to impregnate her with her most recent child. Even thoughAdessa had killed Ian when he betrayed Ildakar, she could not deny the fondnessshe’d felt for him. If only he had not been corrupted. . . .At Gant’s Ford, after leaving the Farrier family, she considered finding ariverboat pilot who would take her upriver to Ildakar, but Adessa was in no moodfor company. She could travel swiftly enough alone, and she had been by herselfever since the sovrena sent her on this hunt. By now the uprising in Ildakarwould have been subdued, Thora and the wizards’ duma would have reestablishedtheir rule and punished the criminals. Adessa would come home triumphant.She followed a dirt road alongside the Killraven River, but as she went fartherfrom the town, the path degenerated into a faint trail among the trees. Thedangerous swamps far to the north would be much more of a challenge.After a day of hard traveling, she ate dried meat and fruit from her pack andeventually stopped to make camp. Adessa gathered dry wood in a clearing and saton a fallen tree whose bark had rotted away. The campfire of dry willow wood,grasses, and oak twigs cracked and popped, exhaling a ribbon of smoke. She drankfrom her waterskin and made a small meal of more preserved food. In a few days,she would have to hunt, but tonight she would just rest and then move on as soonas the sun rose.The nearby river curled along the banks with a whispering sound. Night birdschirped and insects muttered as they stirred in the comforting darkness.Adessa picked up the sack with its grisly burden and set Maxim’s head on a stumpacross from the campfire. She pushed the fabric down to expose the discolored,swollen skin. The wizard commander’s eyes were puffy and half open, a gelatinousmilky white. His mouth hung slack as the lips drooped to expose his teeth. Hehad once possessed a capricious trickster smile filled with more poison thanhumor. Now his skin held an oily greenish cast of decay, and rusty brown stainscovered the stump of his neck.Trying to balance the head upright, she pressed down to squish the soft tissue.“You will be my company for the evening,” Adessa said. “But you were not goodcompany in life. Sovrena Thora despised you. Now you will at least be silent andrespectful.”With his dead face across from her, Adessa squatted on the log and contemplatedas she finished her meal. Ravens squawked in the trees above the river and burstinto flight. She looked up, wondering what had disturbed them.Then a taunting voice sent splinters of ice down her spine. “You think you havewon.”Her hand flashed to the short sword at her side and she rose from her seat. Thecampfire snapped again. She looked around.“You won’t win,” the voice said, and she turned toward Maxim’s head. Thoughbloated and discolored with decomposition, his eyes were now open, with thewhites focused on her. “Ildakar has already fallen.”“By the Keeper!” she cried.“Yes, by the Keeper.” Maxim’s lips spread apart and cracked as pus leakedthrough them. His swollen tongue protruded from his teeth as the jaws moved toform words. “You haven’t finished the job, morazeth.”Sure that she was imagining this nonsense, Adessa stared. “Be silent!”When Maxim laughed, his head wobbled on the stump. “The veil is frayed, theboundaries slippery. Many souls moved through the cracks.” The head chuckledagain. “And I am slippery indeed.”“Be silent!”Gripping her short sword, she strode around the fire to loom over the severedhead. The eyes blinked at her in mocking innocence.“I hacked your head from your body,” Adessa said. “I shattered your chest with atree and burst your heart. You are dead.”“Maybe I can’t be killed so easily.” He laughed again.“I will cleave your head in two, and then I will chop those pieces into morepieces.”He merely scoffed at her. “You think that by removing this receptacle you candestroy my spirit? You are welcome to try.” His lips curled in a sneer. Hisrotting eyes squinched shut and he opened them again so that runny liquid oozedout of his eyeballs. “Did you not promise my dear Thora you would bring her myhead? If you hack me to bits, how will you explain your failure?”Adessa wavered, glaring down at him.The eerie voice continued, “Come, we will be companions on the long journey backto Ildakar! But I assure you, nothing remains of the city.” He snickered again.“How would you know? You’ve been gone so long.”“You’re lying.”“I see things as a spirit.”“You know nothing. You’re my victim. You’re dead.”“I am,” Maxim replied. “And yet I am still here.”Frustrated and disgusted, she yanked the burlap sack over the severed head,wrapping it up and tying it tightly. Now his voice was just a whisper, but stillthere. She set her burden on the other side of the fallen tree. Adessa had nofurther appetite, nor could she sleep throughout the long and noisy night."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 [part0003.html#a7]Throughout the bright daylight hours, the Hidden People busied themselves insidethe gloomy buildings of Orogang. They had plugged every chink, sealed everycrack so that no hint of sunshine could penetrate their sanctuary. The pallidmen and women struck sparks to torches, lanterns, and candles to illuminate thecorridors of the palace. Even safe and sheltered within the blocky walls, theystill moved furtively.Nicci looked up to the high arches where the stone pillars vanished into shadowsoverhead. Old Cora led her through great, dim chambers where the cool stonewalls were covered with patches of moss. “Why did you come to us?” the old womanasked. “Orogang sees almost no travelers. What brought you here?”Tagging along, young Asha added, “Did you come over the mountain road? We keepit guarded, but our night hunting parties didn’t see you.”Several others walked close, their gray garments rustling as they followed,listening. They spoke in low voices, as if their language were composed entirelyof rumors.“I did not come by road,” Nicci said. “The sliph carried me. If you have livedin this city for so long, surely you know of her well?”The Hidden People muttered nervously. Cora considered. “We have heard stories ofthe silvery woman in the well, but no one has seen her in our memory. It is saidshe fell dormant more than a thousand years before Emperor Kurgan.”“The sliph was created to transport spies and saboteurs for Emperor Sulachan,long before Iron Fang was born.” Nicci straightened. “I awakened her. I wantedher to take me to Ildakar, but instead she abandoned me here. Something strangehappened during our journey. She thinks I betrayed her.” Her heart felt heavywith the knowledge that she might not ever summon the creature again. The sliphwas gone. “But I have to get back to my friends. There is a terrible war, and Ican’t stay here.”Cora paused as she led Nicci along. “Another terrible war. There is always aterrible war.”They entered a cavernous chamber with a domed ceiling supported by giganticmarble pillars. Nicci paused to take in the size, assuming this must have been agrand throne room. Iron Fang’s?“Ildakar is many days’ ride from here.” Cyrus sounded dubious as he accompaniedthem. “And the sliph brought you all that way?”“The sliph carried me to Serrimundi on the coast and Tanimura before that. Thoseplaces are much farther away than Ildakar. Distance is not the same for such acreature.” Nicci paused. “But if I cannot summon her again, then I have no wayto get to where I need to be—not in time. Ildakar is under siege, and it mayalready have fallen.”“Our people cannot leave Orogang, or we would help you,” Cora said. “Because ofthe zhiss, we are honor-bound to remain here and keep the rest of the worldsafe.”Nicci looked around at the shadowy people, who slipped in and out of corridorsand disappeared into dark passageways. “How many of you are there?” Hundreds hadswarmed into the city square when they attempted to capture her, and she hadseen many more silhouettes hovering in the doorways and arches of the sealedbuildings. Were they a significant fighting force?“Many,” Cora said. “Our people live inside the buildings and in the catacombsthat connect the largest structures, others in caves in the mountains. We areeverywhere in Orogang, but we don’t allow ourselves to be seen.”The torches burned like fiery eyes filling the large chambers. Emperor Kurgan’sancient palace held innumerable wings and chambers, as well as undergroundlevels, but shadows disguised the magnitude of the place. The ancient capitalcity had many imposing structures. Iron Fang had built them all with heavy taxesand forced labor as he crushed citizens to prove his power. Though he had beenmurdered by his own people, Kurgan’s monuments had endured for fifteencenturies.The Hidden People went about their daily business. In large communal chambers,Nicci heard the clack of looms, the rasp of files, the rough biting sound ofsmall saws. Craftsmen were shaping wood to make chairs, building tables,creating common amenities. Others wove fabric or spun yarn, while seamstressessewed garments. The interior of the city had a hushed quality, but Nicci alsosensed a certain contentment rather than fear.“How do you feed so many people?” she asked. “I saw storehouses and granaries inthe streets. Do you really farm at night?”“We plant crops,” Cora explained. “The daylight cares for its own and the zhissdo not bother the plants. At night we till and harvest. Our hunters bring backmeat.” Her smile showed genuine satisfaction. “We produce enough to care forourselves.”Asha pulled ahead, excited. “But there’s more! Our most important crop isunderground. Come, let me show you.” The girl reached an arched doorway above adescending stone staircase. She trotted down the steps with a patter of feet,leading them to a dark lower level beneath the palace.Nicci followed Asha down claustrophobic and confined stairs into an undergroundchamber with rough rock walls. The room was illuminated by an eerie silver-bluelight emanating from fleshy growths that covered the walls. Nicci smelled alingering swampy odor in the air that was not entirely unpleasant.Ten Hidden People, including some younger children, worked among the bulbousgrowths. They carried baskets and harvested the gray-white fungus, while othersdistributed brown mulch from baskets to fertilize the growths. Asha tore a pieceof the shapeless mass from the wall and popped it into her mouth, obviouslyrelishing the taste.As stern Cyrus stood at Cora’s shoulder, the old woman spoke with a hint of awe.“We cultivate and nurture this substance, making it our greatest weapon againstthe zhiss. This is why the swarm has not swelled across the land.”Two of the children harvested the mushrooms, stuffing their baskets whilesnitching a bite or two.Cyrus also took a mouthful, as if it were his duty. “We consume the specialfungus every day so that it permeates our flesh. It . . . helps our work.”Nicci realized how hungry she was after her ordeals, and she reached out to takea sample, but Cora violently yanked her hand away. “Not for you, Sorceress! Notfor you.”Nicci backed away. “I do not understand you or your people.”The old woman seemed conciliatory. “We will explain everything. It isimportant.” She picked one of the misshapen mushrooms and crushed it in herpalm, showing the mess to Nicci, who inhaled a deeper breath. With her gift andher heightened senses, she found an ominous undertone to the slightly savorysmell, a foul chemical that she had not noticed before. Cora said, “The fungusis deadly to all who are not accustomed to it, a poison as strong as thedeathrise flower. It would kill you if you ate even a mouthful.”As they stood in the lambent glow of the chamber, Nicci watched other peoplearrive for their daily rations, plucking the fast-growing mushrooms and eatingthem as they walked back out.“This fungus makes us deadly to the zhiss,” Cora continued. “We have bredourselves to endure it. We accustom our bodies to the poison from the time weare mere infants. We expose our bodies to the chemical, building up ourresistance until our blood, our skin, every bit of us is filled with thepoison.”Cyrus frowned at Nicci. “You could not survive it, Sorceress, no matter howgreat your gift is.”Nicci had endured poisons before, but she did not wish to test this, especiallywhen she was already weak after her ordeal in the sliph. “I need to regain mystrength, not diminish it. If the sliph does not respond to my summons, then Iwill have an arduous journey ahead of me . . . if I can find my way back.”“We know where Ildakar is,” Cora said. “We can show you the mountains and thepasses and how to get there. I am even familiar with these cities on the coastthat you call Serrimundi and Tanimura, though our records are ancient.”“How can you know about the coast if you have never left this city?” Nicciasked. “Orogang has been cut off for centuries.”The old woman gave a mysterious smile. “That doesn’t mean we have forgotten.”Leaving the fungus chamber, Cora led her and the others into an enclosed wingaboveground that connected to another grand building. They entered a speakingchamber with tiers of empty benches and a great open area for lectures on thefloor. It was a place where Nicci could imagine shouting sessions and politicaldebates.On the floor stood a solid table on legs as wide as tree trunks. The table helda large, immaculately detailed relief map of the Old World sculpted out of clayand painted with natural colors. It was as if someone had shrunk down the actualmountains, valleys, and rivers of the Old World to fit there.Bright lanterns rested on the four corners of the massive table, like sunsshining down on the terrain. Previously, Nicci had seen only small swatches ofthe Old World marked on maps, but this three-dimensional representationencompassed the entirety of the Old World, from the coastline to the mountainsand beyond.Cora stretched out her arm and touched a bowl in the craggy mountains surroundedby difficult passes but connected by the fine lines of well-traveled imperialroads. “This is Orogang, the center of Iron Fang’s great empire.”The old woman traced her fingertips along mountain ridges, following the roadssouth, plunging down into drainages and wider valleys as converging streamsformed the headwaters of the Killraven River, which led south to anotherprominent city, Ildakar. From there, the river rolled along until it reached awidening estuary that spilled into the sea. Finding Ildakar, Nicci retraced thepath that she, Nathan, and Bannon had traveled over the high pass of Kol Adair,back to the desert canyons that hid Cliffwall, and westward over more ridges tothe sea and Renda Bay. She followed the coastline to the north, saw numerousshoreline cities all the way up to Serrimundi and Tanimura.“This map was created long ago by order of Emperor Kurgan. He wanted to know thewhole world, because he commanded General Utros to conquer the whole world.”“And General Utros will return someday,” said Cyrus, who stood utterlyconfident, his pale chin thrust forward. “Remember the old prophecy! We havebeen waiting for so long, though he is surely long dead. . . .”Nicci surprised them. “Oh, General Utros still lives. He and his giant army wereturned to stone for centuries by the wizards of Ildakar, but now they haveawakened.” Cyrus looked astonished by the news, but she cautioned him, “Hear me,he is no savior. Even though Iron Fang is long dead, Utros means to conquer theOld World for himself. Do not expect him to be your hero.”“We have had legends for generation after generation.” Cyrus stiffened, squaredhis shoulders. “He is a great man. The prophecy tells us he is coming back forus.”“You might have legends, but I have confronted the man myself. I know how muchdestruction his army will cause, how many people will die because of hisambition. You should fear him, not hope for his return.”Cyrus scoffed, “I will believe what I wish to believe.”Beside Nicci, Cora adjusted her gray cloak. “I would not put too much stock inlegends or supposed prophecies, Cyrus. Your people have held on to a vain hopefor too long. Remember, we also know silly tales about Iron Fang, myths thatportray Kurgan as a brave and noble emperor, and he was certainly not worthy oflegends or hope. How do you know General Utros is worthy?”“Because I know,” Cyrus said with rising defiance. His gray eyes showed nointerest in the truth. “I believe the prophecy.”Nicci had seen the same blank and intolerant expression many times in thefollowers of the Imperial Order. She, too, had believed in their teachings andrefused to consider that she herself might have been deluded, that she mighthave been wrong. Not until Richard . . .“I know the truth as well,” Nicci said, “whether or not you believe it.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 [part0003.html#a7]The huge army moved out, more than a hundred thousand soldiers along withcountless cooks, carpenters, leatherworkers, swordsmiths, horse handlers, andcraftsmen. Each man was responsible for his own armor, his own weapons, his ownboots. He had to mend his cloak, build a fire, chop wood, dig latrines. Themilitary force was an enormous city on the move in search of conquest.The first divisions moved out at sunrise. They marched across the valley awayfrom the blank space that had been Ildakar, heading toward the foothills and themountains farther west. Second Commanders Halders and Arros mounted theirwarhorses and rode at the head of large companies that fell naturally intoranks.General Utros watched from his command pavilion with Ava and Ruva hoveringbeside him. He was pleased that the war had actually begun again. “My army islike a great boulder on a hillside. It needs a push to start it rolling, butthen it will crash downhill, unstoppable, destroying everything in its way.” Thegolden mask hid half of his smile. “I will be the unstoppable force that crushesthe Old World into submission.”Ava looked up at him as if she were entranced by a glamour spell. “What aboutKing Grieve? Will you not share the land with the Norukai?”“They are barely more than animals. Let us see how many Norukai survive afterthe war is won.”With a rumble of hoofbeats, boots, and creaking wagon wheels, the army movedwest toward the foothills, raising clouds of dust and ash across the burnedvalley floor. The soldiers had eaten all the confiscated supplies, so each manwent to bed with food in his belly and few questions. They would march untilGeneral Utros told them otherwise.He had dispatched six more expeditionary armies, each with two thousand men, tohead off in different directions, seeking cities to plunder and stockpiles toraid in his name. Thus, Utros increased the size of his invasion and alsodecreased the number of mouths he had to feed by twelve thousand. Meanwhile, hisprimary force headed relentlessly over the mountains.Knowing the situation, First Commander Enoch sat grimly in his saddle as he rodeup. He looked down at General Utros and the two sorceresses, who stood togetheroutside the command pavilion. As the remaining companies formed ranks to moveout, the pavilion would be broken down and packed into supply wagons. Utros andthe twins would mount up and follow the main army.“Your soldiers are determined now, General, and they will focus on the march,”Enoch said. “But before long they will think about their sore feet and thediscomfort of a rough camp. The day after that, they will think only about howhungry they are and worse, how hungry they are going to get.” He scratched athin white scar on his cheek. “They revere you, sir, I have no doubt of that,but the pang of an empty belly for long enough may break even the greatestloyalty.”“I know the costs of loyalty.” Utros thought of what Iron Fang had told himafter discovering his affair with Empress Majel. Loyalty is greater than love.After her grisly execution in the real world, sweet Majel’s spirit had beentortured for centuries in the underworld, browbeaten and broken by her abusivehusband’s dominant spirit.Loyalty is greater than love.“I will raid any town and dispense all supplies to my soldiers,” Utros said. “Idon’t know any other way to feed them.”Ruva spoke in a whisper as they watched the army plod toward the foothills. “Mysister and I have a way to sustain them, beloved Utros. A dangerous spell. Wewill have to do it in secret, because the men will not like it, now that they’vebeen restored to flesh and blood. But without our help, your army will crumbleand the soldiers will die.”A breeze stirred the heavy fabric of the pavilion, blowing dust past them. “Howwill you do it?” Utros asked.Ava said, “My sister and I know a spell that can reduce the body’s need, slowand numb their appetites, change their metabolism so they will keep going,although it will not last. They will be digesting themselves.”“The spell will also work on the functioning of their bodies,” Ruva added. “Theywill be able to eat anything, digest anything—grasses, trees, bones, whatevernourishment they find. The army will be like a swarm of locusts, stripping theland bare.”“But surviving,” Ava pointed out.When Enoch’s brow furrowed, his many scars looked like twitching worms. “Itsounds like a demeaning thing.”“If they starve and drop dead, they are no good to my war,” the general said.“If they do collapse and fall dead on the march,” Ava said with a smile, “thenthanks to this spell, the others can eat their bodies and gain even morestrength.”Utros did not need to hear more. “They will live and they will keep fighting forme. Tonight in camp, after we have crossed the first foothills, I want you towork your spell.” He sighed. “I will take the credit and the blame, if need be,once the soldiers discover what has been done to them. I promised to keep my menalive, and in this manner they will live.” He looked to the twin sorceresses.“Save them by any means necessary.”*The army trudged into full darkness, trampling the grassy hills and rising intothickening forests. Behind them, the ground was pounded hard by countless boots,flattened and lifeless.After so many years of experience, the soldiers knew how to set up and breakdown camp with quick efficiency. Scouting parties dispersed to cut down treesand build bonfires. Second Commanders Halders and Arros distributed meagerrations, promising the ranks that they would have more to eat as soon as theyraided a city. The soldiers believed them, for now.Each man found some patch of ground for his blanket where he could lie down tosleep and look up at the stars while he and his comrades remembered being humanand all they had lost. They were fifteen centuries overdue to meet the Keeper.In front of the command pavilion as darkness settled in, Ava and Ruva laid thefoundations of their spell. The largest bonfire was a beacon of crackling flamesand smoke from the burning green wood. Utros sat outside the newly erectedpavilion where he could watch his camp and listen to the activity. Curious,First Commander Enoch joined the general as the twins made their preparationsfor the dark spell.Ava and Ruva had filled small clay pots with different powders, dried bloodmixed with salt, the ashes of bones, powdered roots, flower petals and berriesthey had collected.When the women proclaimed themselves to be ready, both were naked, their bluegowns discarded, all hair cleanly shaved from their skin, scalp, eyebrows,armpits, even the thatch between their legs. With their bodies painted withwhirling patterns of deep red, intense black, and bursts of white, Utros barelynoticed their nakedness. Each woman cradled a small pot of powder against herflat stomach. “We will begin, beloved Utros.”Ava dipped into one of the pots and held up a finger covered with a greasyyellow substance like tallow mixed with honey and sulfur. She dabbed a mark atthe center of the general’s forehead at the edge of his golden half mask.“What is this for?” he asked.“To protect you.”“Is your magic dangerous? Are my men at risk?”“It will save you,” Ruva replied.Ava smeared a dab of the substance on her own forehead, then did the same to hersister. “This will nullify the spell. The magic won’t change you. You will stayhuman.”Concerned, Enoch rose to his feet. “If we are asking the soldiers to make thissacrifice, should we not do the same?”“There was a time I would have said yes,” Utros said, “but so much is uncertain.We need to lead them, First Commander.” He gestured toward Enoch. “Give him themark as well.”When Ava stepped forward with the pot, Enoch raised his arm to ward her off. “Idon’t want it.” But when Utros gave him a steely glare, the veteran lowered hisarm with a sigh. “If you must.” As Ava marked his forehead, he asked, “Is thisspell reversible? Once you have placed it on all these soldiers, can you changethem back? After we achieve our victory and have all the supplies we need, canthey be normal again?”The twin sorceresses replied with noncommittal shrugs. “It’s what we have todo.”The soldiers bedded down around their fires, exchanging stories, comparingdreams, and boasting about how wealthy they would be from the spoils of war, howmany enemies they would kill.Ava and Ruva circled the largest bonfire, throwing powders into the embers.Sparks flared and the smoke thickened, changed color, and spread like a miasmaacross the camp. Near their own campfires, the other soldiers didn’t notice themysterious smoke.The sorceresses began a low chanting. They threw blood powder, bone ashes,flammable mineral dust, dried mushrooms, and ground-up tubers. The heady smokedispersed among the scattered soldiers, changing them, tightening theirstomachs, altering their blood flow.“I need for them to survive until we reach the big cities, and there we willtake enough supplies to feed them all again,” Utros said.“Your army will carve a swath over the mountains all the way to the coast,General,” Enoch said. “Nothing can stop them.”“Good.” Utros crossed his muscular arms over his chest and surprised the othersas he announced his unexpected decision. “For the next several days, the army isin your hands, First Commander. You will lead the continuing march, while I needto depart for another destination.” He had been considering his next move ingreat detail, but there was something else he had to do first. “I will take athousand mounted soldiers and ride hard to the north. Ava and Ruva will go withme.”Alarmed, Enoch wiped the smear of greasy yellow off his forehead now that thespell had been cast. “You leave the army under my command? Where are you going,sir? The soldiers will want to know.”Utros nodded slowly. “Emperor Kurgan is long dead, but surely some remnant ofthe empire must remain. I serve the empire.” He looked through the darkness,seeing the shadowed silhouettes of hills that blocked the vault of sky. “We willmake the long ride to the capital city of Orogang so that I can report towhoever is left there.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 [part0003.html#a7]The defenders straggled in from their separate missions and met at a sandstoneoutcropping in the forest. Some looked frightened, while some were giddy withexcitement. Nathan did a rough tally, guessing that several hundred ancientwarriors had been killed, all told, but four D’Haran soldiers had fallen in thevarious skirmishes. Most battlefield commanders would consider those acceptablelosses, but losing even four members of their ragtag band was a serious blow.The last group to return included Captain Trevor and the wizard Leo. Leo was askinny man with a narrow face, shaggy gray-black hair, and a dark goatee. He hadmanaged two yaxen slaughterhouses in Ildakar, but those days were gone. Heseemed terrified as he sat among the others beneath the sandstone overhang. Hishands were covered with drying blood. “I killed people. I used my gift, andI . . . I tore them to pieces. I watched them die.”“They were our enemies,” Zimmer said. “It is what they deserved. You alreadykilled many on the battlefield while you were helping Elsa lay down hertransference magic.”Leo nodded, though he still looked shaken.“That is how we survive,” Verna explained to him in a calm voice. “And therewill need to be much more killing.”Oliver and Peretta returned to the camp with water from a nearby stream, whileAmber and several Sisters of the Light foraged for berries and wild vegetables.Since they couldn’t risk building fires, Nathan used his gift to heat a flatslab of rock, which served as a stove, and Rendell made a decent meal by boilingdried beans along with some wild onions. They shared stories as they ate.As he listened to Renn talk about Hanavir, Nathan absently rubbed the scar onhis chest. Although his new heart beat steadily, he felt a dark vengeance tryingto gain hold of his thoughts. A foreign part of his mind, some stain of ChiefHandler Ivan that still dwelled inside the heart, chastised him about what hehad done when faced with the terrible decision. Ivan’s sour presence complainedthat Nathan and Renn should have shown no mercy, that the weak townspeople ofHanavir were a necessary sacrifice to stop the raiding party. They deserved it.How many more people would die, now that General Utros could feed his army?Nathan gritted his teeth. His heart—Ivan’s heart—beat like a loud primal druminside his chest.Trying to drown out the unwelcome thoughts, he lurched to his feet, startlingthe others as he breathed hard and heavy to drive back the pain. “Hanavir couldhave gone a different way,” he said, interrupting Renn and ignoring the alarmedexpressions around him, “but then there would have been more bloodshed. We haveto save people where we can and when we can!” His pulse calmed as he exertedcontrol over his rebellious heart. He sat back down, insisting he was all right,and quietly ate his beans.Thorn, who had accompanied General Zimmer’s group, proudly told of how they haddefeated a hundred and twenty armed soldiers outside of a mining village. Sheand her sister morazeth Lyesse compared notes about their victims. Nathan foundtheir discussion an odd mixture of boasting and technical advice on killing theenemy.With a concerned look, Verna offered him a handful of berries that Amber hadgathered. “Is this our life now, Nathan? Hiding in the forest, harassing thefringes of an overwhelming army, and then running again?”Lyesse heard the comment and made a defensive reply. “We’re more nimble than thearmy is. Our small group can strike and run, strike and run. Given severalyears, we will decimate them.”“Dear spirits . . .” Nathan shook his head. “I don’t doubt your claim, but foolscan be confident as well—and we can’t afford to be fools.”Zimmer squatted on a rock across from them, wolfing down his meal. As a militarycommander he had eaten camp food for much of his life. “General Utros is now onthe move. We saw them break camp and depart yesterday, marching across thevalley into the foothills. It’s our job to stop them.”Nathan pondered the great distances that he, Nicci, and Bannon had alreadytraveled across the Old World. He didn’t downplay the tremendous dangers theyhad faced in their journeys—the Lifedrinker, the sorceress Victoria, the deadlysecrets of Ildakar itself—but the unstoppable army of General Utros might be thegreatest threat. “We can’t just endlessly strike and run. We may hurt them, orwe may just annoy them. We need a better plan.”Oron cracked his knuckles and said sarcastically, “Yes, why not find aninvincible weapon or gather our own huge army? How do you suggest we do that,Nathan?”“I do not appreciate your attitude.” He had washed his face, cleaned hisgarments, and actually felt presentable. That made him feel like a wizard again.“As a matter of fact, I do have an idea. We can obviously move much faster thanthe huge army, and our path will take us back to Cliffwall. The scholars therecan help us find powerful magical defenses inside the archive. It may be ourbest chance. We’ll get there well ahead of General Utros.”Peretta nudged Oliver, who sat next to her. “Yes! At Cliffwall, we can alsotrain all those gifted scholars to fight.”Prelate Verna had the same thought. “And once we’re hidden at Cliffwall, we’llbe safe from the army, at least for a time. Utros will never even know to gothere.”“It’s decided then,” Zimmer said. “We will move at our best pace back toCliffwall.”Lyesse and Thorn looked at each other, and then in an oddly synchronized gesturethey removed their daggers and began to sharpen the edges on a nearby rock. “Butwe will still harass them and kill as many as possible on the way.”“Yes,” Thorn agreed. “It only makes sense.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 [part0003.html#a7]After a day sealed inside the ancient buildings, Nicci felt restless. Sheunderstood the plight of the Hidden People against the bloodthirsty zhiss, buther greatest concern was General Utros’s army and the threat to the entirecontinent. He might be marching now! She couldn’t hide inside the safety ofshadows when those soldiers might be battering down the walls of Ildakar. OrIldakar itself might be gone, if she understood the cryptic comment the sliphhad made before vanishing.The ambitious general would not rest on one victory or one failure. Conquest washis mind-set, and Nicci had to help stop him. She had left Nathan and Bannonbehind, as well as the gifted members of the wizards’ duma. She needed to find away to go back.Recovering from her strange weakness after her last sliph journey, Nicci restedin former guest quarters in the emperor’s palace. Most furnishings had longsince been removed, and the remaining tapestries and curtains were faded. TheHidden People lived a drab existence devoid of sunlight, color, and joy.Young Asha brought her water, bread, and meat, and Nicci tried to rebuild herenergy, but sleep refused to come. Too many priorities and frustrations consumedher.Her sensitive ears picked up soft footsteps in the corridor, and Cora appearedin the open doorway. The old woman said, “The sun has gone down, and it is safefor us to venture out into the darkness. If you want to go into the citystreets, now is the time for you to do so.”“I’m not your prisoner then?” Nicci asked.Cora was startled. “Not at all. We tried to keep you safe, not hold you captive!You are a powerful sorceress. If you wanted to fight your way free, we could notstop you.”“No, you could not. It is good that you won’t try.”Backlit by the hall torches, Cora adjusted her gray garments. “We hope youunderstand the danger now. The sun is down, the city is dark, and the zhiss havereturned to their lair. You can go where you wish. If you decide you must leaveOrogang, make sure you are far from the city by dawn, or the zhiss will findyou.”Nicci had crossed a continent with Nathan and Bannon, and long before that, whenshe had kidnapped Richard, the two of them traveled from Westland all the way toAltur’Rang. She had seen the sculpted map in the speaking chamber and knewgenerally how she could travel south out of the mountains back to Ildakar. Sucha trek would take planning, though, and Nicci reconsidered. “I’m not ready forthat yet. I must try another means of travel first.” Maybe she could get thesliph to listen. . . .She followed Cora through the winding corridors of the imposing palace to wherethe main wooden doors swung wide to the night. Nicci breathed deeply, lettingthe cool air bathe her face. A faint breeze ruffled her ragged blond hair.Trellises held sweet-smelling vine flowers, and fluttering moths swooped around,drinking nectar from the white blossoms.Outside, the Hidden People scoured the nearby hills. Some were already returningwith cartloads of wood, while others moved supplies from isolated storagebuildings. Silent men and women worked in garden plots or tended orchards.Except for the constant danger of the zhiss, this city seemed almost peaceful.While Cora joined a team harvesting vegetables from gardens, Nicci walkedthrough the streets of Orogang, always aware that she had to get back to shelterby sunrise. She remembered how the black cloud had swarmed around the twohapless deer and drained them dry.She explored, walking among the fallen columns, collapsed archways, and the hugesunken amphitheater. She passed the towering statue of General Utros, where thedour Cyrus bowed reverently to his long-lost military hero. Others of hisfaction had draped offerings of night-blooming lilies around the granite base.The delicate pale flowers would shrivel in the next day’s sunlight, but theHidden People who revered the ancient general would add fresh flowers, nightafter night. Though she didn’t accept the deluded prophecy that their great herowould return, Nicci did not disturb them. She had other business. She made herway to the empty sliph well.The toppled statue of Emperor Kurgan sprawled in the square, the head brokenoff, the stone arm snapped just above the elbow. The emperor’s face retained ahaughty expression. Even if she had known nothing about Iron Fang’s violenthistory, she would have disliked him just from the stone sneer.Nicci had little interest in a forgotten tyrant, though. Right now the sliph wasthe most important thing . . . the sliph who had served Emperor Sulachan anddespised anyone who did not follow that evil man’s cause.During the great war three millennia ago, this sliph had been created withterrible magic, a zealous volunteer transformed into a liquid-metal creature.That fiercely dedicated young woman had given up her life to become an inhumanbeing with the power to transport clients through a secret network. Nicci didnot know the woman’s original name, only that she considered her duty to EmperorSulachan to be greater than her own happiness, her own family, her own loves,her own life.Now, Nicci stepped up to the waist-high wall that encircled a bottomless pit.The stones had been mortared together, fitted so well that she could barely seethe cracks. A dank smell wafted up from the depths.She had traveled by sliph many times before, engulfed in the amorphous silverysubstance and hurtled along the unseen passageways. The sliph had brought herhere to Orogang because she said Ildakar was gone. They had both been damaged bythe unexpected deflection from their goal.Worse, Nicci had unwittingly revealed to the sliph the failure of Sulachan’scause, telling her that the ancient emperor was long dead. The petulant creaturehad fled, vowing never to help her.Leaning over the low wall, Nicci felt the resounding silence in that deep well.“Sliph! I wish to travel.”Her words echoed in the well, bouncing down like dropped stones that never hitbottom. Not expecting an immediate answer, she listened but did not hear thefrothy sound of the approaching creature. Nicci peered into the depths andthought of the blackness she had held in her own heart. She was stronger thanthat now, better than that.“Sliph!” she called again. “I command you. I wish to travel. You were made tocarry passengers, and you have carried me before. Take me back to Serrimundi.”She raised her voice. “Take me back! Now!”Her words were just hollow ricochets down into the emptiness. She gripped theedge of the low wall, pressing her hands hard into the cool stone. She reachedout with magic, shouting with more than just words. She touched the Subtractiveside of her gift, the darkness that had once served the Keeper, and she alsopulled with Additive Magic, stretching out to summon the sliph with the fullspectrum of her abilities. Only those with both sides of the gift could summon asliph, and now Nicci beseeched her.The silvery woman ignored her.If she could not persuade the sliph to grant her passage to one of the greatcities, Nicci would have to set off on foot. But if Ildakar had disappeared,that journey across the continent might take months or longer. Where would shego? All the way back to Serrimundi?“Sliph!” she shouted with greater desperation. Nicci had no way to force thecreature, no means to bribe her, if she could even guess what the sliph mightwant.Then Nicci realized that she did have something to offer! She had made the sliphdistraught by telling her that Sulachan was gone, but she had explained nothingmore. This woman had surrendered her humanity because she was so dedicated to anancient cause. The sliph would want to know the answers about her sacred leader,and Nicci was her only possible source for information.It was a gamble, but she thought it might work, the most tantalizing carrot shecould dangle before the sliph. Nicci leaned over the well. “If you take me backto Serrimundi, then I will tell you what happened to Sulachan. All of it. Everydetail. I’ll reveal the history of how he was defeated in his original war, butSulachan came back from the dead to lead his armies again—and that was only ayear ago. Can you exist without knowing? I will tell you about your cause.”After a pause, she spoke louder. “After three thousand years Sulachan returnedas the spirit king and almost conquered the world again—while you slept. I willtell you how you could have helped him. Don’t you want to know?”She hunched over the well and waited, listening. Surely the temptation would begreat? She heard nothing but the Hidden People stirring in the dark city.Nicci called down even louder. “This is your cause, sliph, and I am the only onewho has the answers! I can tell you. If we cannot go to Ildakar, then take meback to Serrimundi. I have much to reveal to you. Don’t you want to know?” Shefelt certain that the sliph had heard her, but no response came. “Don’t you needto know?”Throughout the night, the moon moved overhead in a slow arc across the heavens.Nicci remained there for hours, cajoling the sliph, enticing her, but to noeffect. As the night ended, the Hidden People moved back toward their shadowysanctuaries. Nicci was sure she had failed. She was stuck in the heart of anempire that no longer existed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 [part0003.html#a7]The swamp dragon’s jaws were as strong as the winches on the main gates ofIldakar. Lila strained against the monster in the midafternoon sunlight. Shecould feel sharp teeth against her skin as the monster tried to bite off herarm. The smell of decaying meat in the uneven rows of teeth made her gag.She pitted her muscles against the creature. The underbrush crashed as the scalybeast dug its clawed feet into the mud to find purchase, but Lila pushed itback. The armored tail thrashed. They were matched in strength, but the swampdragon was a primitive, stupid brute, and she was a morazeth.Lila shoved with an extra burst of energy, yanked her arm free of its jaws, andspun as it recoiled in surprise. She lunged with her dagger when the beastopened its jaws wide. She drove her arm into the open mouth, and the daggerpierced the pink flesh of its gullet. She thrust into the back of its throatuntil she severed its spine from the inside.The swamp dragon continued to twitch and snap, already dead but still deadly asits wild nerves kept firing. Panting and exhausted, Lila dragged herself out ofthe fang-filled mouth and rolled on her back into the muddy sawgrass. The swampdragon let out a belching exhalation as it quivered in death. Lila got to herfeet again, covered in blood, slime, and mud. She kicked the armored body withthe hard sole of her sandal, shoving the large beast into the muck.Tributaries and side currents curled like snakes through the vegetation. Thedead reptile floated along in the shallow water, drifting as the current tuggedit. Already, Lila could hear splashes and ripples as more swamp dragons prowledtoward the disturbance. Though eager to feast on human flesh, the scalypredators were just as happy to devour the carcass of one of their own. Meat wasmeat in the deadly Killraven swamps.Lila would have preferred to rest and eat her own meal, but she couldn’t affordthe time. The swamp dragon had already delayed her enough. She sprinted offthrough the grasses, splashing in the shallow mud and ducking under danglingvines and mosses. Her struggle had made a great deal of noise, and Lila didn’twant any Norukai scouts to investigate, though she was confident she could killthem all. And she would, when the time was right.Lila kept moving at a steady pace, jogging downriver. The three serpent shipshad already sailed out of sight, and Lila had to keep up with them. Fortunately,the raiders dropped anchor at night, so as not to crash into river hazards inthe dark. She didn’t fear the swamp predators as much as she feared losingBannon.For years she had fought combat beasts in the arena. As a young woman, when shefirst trained as a morazeth, Lila had defeated any opponent, honed her skills,and received the protective runes that her trainers burned into her smooth skin.Combat came to her as instinctively as breathing and eating. She hadsingle-handedly killed spiny wolves and a razor-tusked boar with nothing morethan a short knife. Her back still bore long scars from when a combat bear hadmauled her, but although her skin hung in tatters, Lila had killed it.When she’d become a full morazeth, Lila began to train combat slaves, some ofwhom accepted their chance to achieve glory while others resented her for it.Lila had no sympathy for any of them. Her job was to turn the trainees intoskilled warriors, whether or not they liked it. She was proud of what she hadachieved.Bannon had been one of the most difficult trainees, and she was especiallypleased with him. That was why she protected the young man, why she rewarded himwith her body, and why she felt affection for him against her better judgment.Bannon was earnest and dedicated, unlike any other slave she had seen inIldakar. His eagerness gave him a naiveté that seemed absurd, yet his optimisticfaçade covered a deep darkness inside, scars from unspeakable pain in his life.Lila had helped him find balance so that he could become the best fighter, thebest killer.At one time, her job had been to create arena fighters merely for theentertainment of the Ildakaran nobles, but now she realized there were so manymore important things she and Bannon could do together. First, though, she hadto free him.She still had his sword, which was a sufficient weapon for what she needed todo. Bannon had used Sturdy to fight against her in the training pits, so sheknew the blade was solid and sharp. She used it to hack a thorny vine out of herway.She ran into a marshy clearing at a bend in the river. On the wide channelahead, she saw the Norukai ships as specks in the distance, but she knew wherethey were going. Lila just kept running. Biting gnats flew around her face,attracted to her sweat, smelling her blood, and she swatted them away.The perils of the swamp were merely an inconvenience. She had to catch theserpent ships, and she refused to lose hope. They would not get away from her.*King Grieve and his raiding ships sailed down the river, and the small riversidevillage was in their path. Lila knew the Norukai could not resist fresh victimsand spoils.She ran through the afternoon and into the sunset. Ahead in the deepeningdarkness, she could see burning huts, smashed piers, a scatter of bodies. Evenabove the buzz of the swamp, she heard faint shouts and screams. She put on aburst of speed, but by the time she arrived at the village, there were few ofthem left alive.The three serpent ships had dropped anchor in the channel, and the ugly raidersrowed to shore in landing boats to fall upon the fishing settlement. As she rancloser, sure she was too late, Lila looked at the aftermath, inhaled the bitter,smoky air. Twenty reed-and-willow huts had been built along the bank, withrickety docks extending out into the water. Other homes were farther from theriver, in the trees. Several of their canoes had been smashed, sunk, or setadrift. Storehouses stood on higher ground above the bank. All were burning. TheNorukai had been pillaging the place for hours already.Lila approached stealthily, keeping to the underbrush. She could hear gutturalshouts from the raiders, groaning and whimpering from captives. Several outlyinghomes were ablaze, and she could hear the screams of people trapped inside.Sprinting past the flickering fires, she came upon sprawled corpses, villagershacked to pieces—old women and children who would have been considered useless,while the stronger men and women must have been dragged back to the serpentships to be sold as slaves.Set back from the riverbank, a shack had been set on fire, and she heard thewails of children inside. An overturned cart had been jammed up against the doorby the cruel Norukai, intentionally preventing anyone from escaping. A man witha splintered boat hook still clenched in his hand lay dead outside the door,gutted. Lila understood the story with just a glance. A father had tried todefend his children, his home, but the Norukai had killed him, then locked theyoung victims inside and set the walls on fire. She imagined the raiderslaughing as they did so.The screams grew more urgent, more despairing. Terrified screams continued fromdeeper in the village, but Lila couldn’t save them all. In her mind, though,Lila could hear Bannon’s voice, insisting that she try to help people howevershe could, that she save as many as possible. Without thinking, she bounded tothe overturned cart that barricaded the shack. She kicked the side of the cart,shoved it away, then yanked the rickety door open.Inside, three red-faced girls were covered with soot, fallen to their knees,coughing. Waves of smoke curled out with the gush of fresh air. The oldest girlemerged to stare at the sprawled body of her father lying facedown in front ofthe shack, but Lila grabbed her arm, swung her in the other direction, andpushed her and her two sisters away from the burning home. “To the forest!” shehissed. “Run and hide in the trees.” She had caught glimpses of other figureswho had fled the village. “You’ll find others out there. Stay with them.”Before the three girls could run, a big Norukai emerged from one of the nearbystorage sheds. He spotted the girls, saw Lila, and his scarred face twisted in ahungry grin.“Go!” she urged the girls, and they bolted, running for the trees. She remainedto face the thug. Lila pulled Sturdy free, gripped the leather-wrapped hilt, andsprang forward, surprising the raider. His slashed mouth dropped open in a roarof challenge, but before he knew what had happened, Lila had hacked sideways toslit open his belly. The Norukai man gurgled as his intestines squirmed out likea basket of escaped snakes.Lila would have liked to let him die slowly from the awful wound, but he wasmaking too much noise. Impatient, she struck off his head and prowled forward,glad she had saved the three girls, but wanting to do more.She saw four landing boats rowing back to the anchored vessels. Some of themcarried huddled prisoners, while others were loaded with sacks of grain, stacksof smoked river fish, casks of supplies stolen from the town. Lila squeezed thesword’s hilt, wanting to kill more of the Norukai.Fortunately for her, a few raiders were still ransacking homes, starting morefires. They were stragglers simply having fun, and so she would have fun, too.One male taunted a growling dog tied to a post before he finally lost patienceand lopped off the dog’s head. Two other scarred men held down and raped asobbing middle-aged woman. With a flare of fury, Lila threw caution aside andran toward them.As one Norukai man finished with the woman, he grunted with displeasure becauseshe had gone limp. Petulant, he stabbed the naked woman in the heart and yankedhis knife free before readjusting his sharkskin girdle. Her dying sigh soundedlike a blessing.It all happened before Lila could get there. She did not scream a challenge,because that would be wasted breath. Instead, she bounded ahead with Bannon’ssword raised. She could not let the man live after what he had done. As therapist turned his hideous face toward her, showing off his lips cut all the wayback to the hinge of his jaw, Lila slashed his throat so viciously she nearlysevered his head. He dropped gurgling on top of his victim.The second raider holding down the now-dead woman let out a surprised shout. Helurched backward, grabbed his battle hatchet, and drew back his arm, but hiswaist girdle had been undone so he could take his turn, and it tangled aroundhis legs. He stumbled.Lila didn’t let emotion color her need. She stabbed him in the gut and slashedsideways, as she had done with the man at the burning shack. As he fell, the manreached out for her with one hand. She kicked him down in a tangle of his ownentrails. “I will let you die at your own speed.”The shacks continued to burn, and Lila heard moans and panicked cries fromanother barricaded home. She tore loose the barrier, freeing the people inside.She kept running, letting the people stagger out, gasping and choking.As she made her way through the village, she took stock of the bloody bodiesscattered about. One old man lay near the ruins of a fish-drying rack. He hadbeen stabbed deep in his side. He reached out to Lila as she knelt beside him,but from her time in the combat arena, she knew it was a mortal wound.She gazed deep into the dark forest beyond the river, the low trees, the willowthickets. She saw more figures running deeper into the forest, survivingfamilies taking desperate shelter. Good, maybe even more of them had survived.“Norukai,” the man said, twitching his fingers.She clutched his hand, because that was what he seemed to need from her. “I knowwho they are. I will kill as many as I can.” She had already made up her mind,but it was what he wanted to hear.“Kill them all,” the man said, then died.“I will.” She set off.A landing boat remained tied to the only intact pier. A Norukai man stood at theprow, impatient to shove off. The other landing boats had already rowed back tothe serpent ships. “Finish up!” he growled to his unseen companions in theburning village. “King Grieve won’t wait for us, and I don’t want to be stuckhere with these vermin.”Lila walked out of the smoke onto the dock as the man looked up at her indisbelief. Even though she held a bloody sword and carried a dagger at her hip,the raider seemed to think she was a gift, not a threat. He stepped out of thelong landing boat and stood on the pier. “Did they send you to me?”“The Keeper sent me to you. Now I send you to him.” Using both hands, she sweptSturdy sideways.The startled man recoiled, barely avoiding the sharp tip. He lost his balance onthe dock and fell into the river. He bellowed and splashed, grabbing on to theboards to haul himself up, cursing her. Lila struck down and lopped off both ofhis hands at the wrists. As he let out a deep-throated scream and flailed hisstumps spouting blood, she thrust Sturdy through his neck. His body slid intothe shallow water and floated away in the current.Out in the middle of the channel, the three serpent ships raised anchor and settheir dark sails. She wasn’t surprised that King Grieve would take his spoilsand depart without even waiting for his last few men.She stood at the end of the pier and watched the ships move. She intended to doexactly what the nameless dying man had demanded of her. She would kill them,and she would free Bannon."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 [part0003.html#a7]As the enemy army pressed through the foothills behind Nathan and hiscompanions, they did not follow single file but spread out, trampling everythingin their wake. The mass of warriors camped for only a few hours each night andmoved again as soon as dawn suffused the sky.Nathan’s band pressed on, but they had not gained a great deal of ground fromthe relentless march of the vast army.“We’ve already killed so many of them, and they keep coming,” Renn said inuneasy awe. The two wizards stood together.Nathan thought of his own loss rather than the enemy’s. “Elsa’s transferencemagic incinerated thousands on the battlefield, but even so, they didn’t pay ahigh enough price.” He shook his head, flushing with anger. “She was worth morethan that whole damned army.”The other wizard’s eyes were red-rimmed, and his mouth sagged in a frown. “AndLani? Did she at least fight well before she died?”Nathan brightened. “Oh, yes! Dear spirits, during our first sortie againstGeneral Utros, Lani made the ground shake with her gift. All by herself sheflattened entire enemy companies. She impressed me very much.”The bedraggled wizard sighed. “Yes, my Lani was a good fighter. I wish I’d beenat her side.”Thorn and Lyesse frequently disappeared from the group, flitting back to preyupon more enemy scouts and stragglers. The morazeth women kept careful score ofthe enemies they killed. Though such losses did little to weaken the multitudes,the bodies discovered every morning caused great agitation in the large army.General Zimmer did not have enough horses for all of them to ride, so manydoubled up as the group made their way toward the hidden archive. He dispatchedone messenger ahead to ride with all possible speed, so Cliffwall could prepare,although the scholars should already have known about the threat of GeneralUtros; Zimmer had already sent word weeks ago, after they had wiped out anexpeditionary army in an avalanche below Kol Adair. By now, Nathan hoped, theimaginative scholars might have found additional defenses to suggest. . . .For his own part, Nathan had hard memories of the archive, the damage done bythe Lifedrinker and the sorceress Victoria, but also the tragic loss of the deargirl Thistle. Nathan knew how much powerful magical lore was stored inCliffwall, and he was sure that some of it could be turned against GeneralUtros, but he also knew how easy it was for that power to grow out of control.He vowed to be vigilant when they searched the dusty library for defensivespells. What could their band of defenders do against an army that had withstoodall the wizards of Ildakar?Because Cliffwall was so cleverly hidden, the ancient army might simply marchpast without any scouts discovering the isolated canyons and the archive. Hecould only hope.Crossing one forested ridge after another, they could see the rugged,snow-streaked mountains in front of them, beyond which were the canyons of thewestern slope. Zimmer and Prelate Verna rode ahead to climb into a sweepingmeadow, a lush hanging valley amid the thick forests. Before them, the widemeadow was filled with a splash of flowers, as if some ambitious painter hadused the high valley as an enormous palette. The plants had swordlike leaves andfleshy green stems; the deep violet flowers were shot through with crimsonveins.As the party emerged from the forest into the flower-filled meadow, Amber letout a cry of delight and slid down from her horse. “They’re beautiful!”Oliver and Peretta joined her. “I’ve never seen so many blooms,” Peretta said.Verna moved into the meadow. “They are indeed beautiful.” General Zimmer staredahead as if searching for a path through the sea of blossoms.“We should bring some specimens with us to Cliffwall,” suggested Oliver.Out of breath, Nathan and Renn trudged up on foot as the troops milled in placebefore the great meadow. Nathan could smell the perfume of flowers in the air.Considering so many open blossoms, he expected to hear a buzz of bees, see aflurry of butterflies, but the meadow seemed oddly silent.Laughing at the beauty, Amber and Peretta ran together toward the meadow, likechildren about to plunge into the ocean. Nathan felt a cold twist in his gut,and he shouted, “Stop! Dear spirits, don’t go there!” But the sounds of thehorses, the muttering soldiers, the rustle of armor drowned out his words.Urgent, he drew a deep breath and shouted out with his gift as well as hisvoice, making a boom of thunder in the air. “Stop!”The blow of the word was enough to bring the young people to a halt. Nathanpushed through the soldiers to reach the edge of the meadow and looked at allthe blooms, aghast. “I know these flowers. They are deathrise flowers, thegreatest poison ever discovered. A single blossom is deadly enough to kill adozen full-grown men. I’m glad I stopped you in time!”The soldiers pulled their horses back. Amber and Peretta retreated, and no oneelse ventured closer. Tossing his long white hair, Nathan cautiously approachedthe meadow, and Renn followed him, curious. “I have never heard of deathriseflowers.”Oron rode up to them, tall in his saddle. He sniffed sarcastically. “We livedinside a walled city for fifteen hundred years, Renn. How much wild plant lifewould you expect us to know?”Zimmer frowned in his saddle as he looked across the meadow. “It will take along time to ride entirely around those flowers.”Like a man approaching a poisonous spider, Nathan bent close to the nearestblossoms, studied their petals without touching them, the intense purple, theslash of deep red, the golden stamens. The mere touch of any one of theseflowers would cause an agonizing death. “Emperor Jagang would grow fields ofthese flowers and then test the poison on his prisoners. Even the smallest touchis enough to bring rashes and blisters, horrible boils. A little more will killyou.”Renn scratched the stubble on his cheek. “There must be thousands of blossoms.”Nathan hung his head, remembering the girl Thistle with her large dark eyes andher positive attitude. Thistle had eaten one of the deathrise flowers, andthereby forced Nicci to kill her to stop the agony. It had been one of the mostterrible choices Nathan had ever witnessed.“Keep the horses away,” Zimmer said, and gestured toward the edge of the meadow.“Follow the trees to the opposite side until you reach the stream, then keep tothe forest.” He shook his head. “Thanks to you, Nathan, we dodged a dangerousthing. We would all have been dead before we crossed the field.”The morazeth trotted up, wondering why the group had stopped. The two women werenot impressed with the pretty flowers, but became much more interested when theylearned about the deadly poison in the blossoms.Nathan kept staring at the meadow, stroking thumb and forefinger along his chinas he pondered. “This is the obvious route through the hills. At least part ofGeneral Utros’s army will surely come this way.” He gave Renn an intense smile.“With a little provocation, we could lure the enemy soldiers right across thismeadow.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 [part0003.html#a7]As she stayed among the Hidden People, contemplating her plans, Nicci recoveredfrom the unsettling side effects of her journey through the sliph, and at lasther gift felt strong again. Trapped inside during daylight hours, she exploredthe gloomy passageways that echoed with whispered footsteps. The silentpopulation seemed as much in a trance as the ancient city was.Asha, Cora, and other Hidden People offered only vague answers to her questionsabout their history in Orogang and how they had watched over the zhiss. As theold woman arranged drooping night lilies in a vase to add a splash of white inthe torchlit gloom, Nicci asked, “Is this all you do every day? You just waitand hide? Do you do nothing else?”“What else can we do?” Cora asked. “We don’t dare leave, or the zhiss willspread far and wide. We have to contain them, and they stay here because of us.That is our purpose.”Agitated, Nicci brushed the soft stems of the lilies. “Is that enough after somany centuries? Will it ever change?”“It will not change until the zhiss are destroyed.”“And will that ever happen?”Cora hung her head. “I do not know, and my grandmothers before me did not know.We can only hope that someday one of our children will rid the world of thisscourge.”“I can’t wait that long,” Nicci said. “I have other things I need toaccomplish.”Cora continued arranging flowers as pointless decoration. Frustrated with thewoman, Nicci returned to her room and lay back, planning how to leave thisisolated city without depending on the sliph. If Ildakar had hidden itself againbeneath the shroud of eternity, then nothing would keep General Utros fromsweeping across the continent. Meanwhile, Nicci was here locked in a building,hiding from daylight. . . .She didn’t realize she had dozed off until she found herself among powerful,feral thoughts. In her dream state, her body shifted to become a tawny felineshape. She prowled along, seeing the world through a predator’s senses. Smellsbecame a different language. Mrra!Part of the sand panther’s mind, Nicci loped along, constantly moving, but shepanted with exhaustion, and her large padded paws were sore and raw. She hadcovered countless miles, racing across the landscape toward a destination thatwas so clear in her mind: Mrra needed to find her sister panther.Nicci had been separated from the sand panther when she traveled through thesliph to Serrimundi, but through the spell bond the two remained connected. Ithad been so long since she’d felt a clear contact that she’d feared Mrra hadbroken the bond. The big cat had been an excellent spy, roaming around theperimeter of the giant army, feeding information to Nicci through her felineeyes.Now, Nicci expressed her joy through the spell bond. She felt a growing awe asshe realized that Mrra had run overland, tracking her down over the mountains.The connection was faint, but she knew that the panther was not far away. Mrracould taste her presence in her mind.“Come to me, sister panther!” Nicci whispered in her sleep.The big cat growled as she bounded through the forest. With her enhanced senses,Nicci realized that other cats were accompanying Mrra. Long ago, when the sandpanther had been raised by the handlers of Ildakar, she was trained to fight andkill in the combat arena. From the time she was just a cub, Mrra had been bondedwith a pair of sand panthers, her troka, who fought together, moved togetherwith shared hearts. But when the other two cats had been killed by Nicci and hercompanions, Mrra was bereft and mortally wounded, until Nicci became her sister.In her lonely sojourn across the landscape, Mrra had encountered other big catsand brought them along as her new pride. Though the sand panther did notunderstand numbers, Nicci sensed there were at least six or seven cats lopingalong beside her across the mountainous terrain.“Come to me,” Nicci murmured in the halfway land of sleep, and Mrra let out aroar in her mind. The other sand panthers roared as well, and Nicci fell into adeeper sleep, content that they would soon be reunited. . . .When she awoke hours later, still groggy and stiff, Nicci went to the speakingchamber to study the relief map and plan her best route over the mountains towhere Ildakar had been, or back to Serrimundi or Tanimura. She had tried to coaxthe sliph with the promise of information about Emperor Sulachan. Had the silvercreature even heard her? There had been no response whatsoever.As Nicci ran her hands over the sculpted map, finding possible routes, one ofthe gray-robed men entered the speaking chamber—dour Cyrus, who believed toomuch in the legend of General Utros. His expression shifted between anger andhope when he saw her. “Though you spoke ill of Utros, we are reassured to knowthat he is alive. He will come for us, just as the prophecy foretold.”“You believe too easily in things,” Nicci said. “If you had seen the generalattack Ildakar, you wouldn’t revere him so much.”“Emperor Kurgan commanded him to attack Ildakar. What else would he do?” A scowlcrossed Cyrus’s face beneath the fold of his gray hood. “Even if he chose thewrong leader to follow, Utros is a great military commander. Iron Fang is longdead, and Utros can be the true ruler that we have always needed. Our peoplewill be part of his new army. He needs us! The Hidden People are a great army.We have waited so long for him.”“Utros has more soldiers than you can imagine,” Nicci said. “How will you helphim? Many mobs consider themselves armies until they face a real enemy.”Cyrus looked at her defiantly. “Follow me. I will show you.”Leaving the speaking chamber, Cyrus glided through the stone corridors until hepaused before a sealed storeroom. Cyrus took a deep anticipatory breath andtugged on the door. The dark wood was so old it looked petrified, and the hingescreaked as they reluctantly swung open.When the torchlight chased away the shadows, Nicci saw a vast chamber filledwith gleaming swords in storage racks, enough weapons for an army of thousands.Spears stood in the corners like corn shocks. Curved helmets were piled onshelves. Stacked shields all bore Kurgan’s flame symbol.Cyrus lifted one of the swords. “We keep these sharpened and oiled, ready to beused the moment General Utros calls us to war. We train at night, practicing ourswordplay in front of his statue.” He looked eager. “We have waited long to becalled to our duty, but it will happen. We know it will happen! Considering thestories of General Utros, we have no doubt.”“You should have doubts,” Nicci scolded. Despite her skepticism about the man’sblind faith, she admired the blades and armor. “There is much you don’t knowabout your hero.”Cyrus cut her off. “I know all I need to know, and we are ready for him.”After showing her the weapons, he ushered her out and closed the door behindthem. She heard the Hidden People stirring inside the dim corridors of theshuttered buildings, their conversations building. Outside, the sun had gonedown, and once again the people had the freedom to roam the city."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 [part0003.html#a7]Inside the enclosed hold of the Norukai serpent ship, the air stank of sweat,fish, and fear. Bannon hunched on the wooden bench, feeling the manacles likejaws around his wrists. The jangle of the heavy chains was softer than thegroans of pain and anxiety from the nearby slaves. But he made himself staystrong. He had survived this long.The oars creaked as the slaves strained to row, driving the serpent shipdownriver. The dull heartbeat of the pace drum echoed inside the hold, where thecaptives struggled to keep up with the rhythm. They worked hard to avoid thewhip of the oar master, who was all too anxious to start the day by making anexample of someone.Open hatches in the hull were designed to let in sunshine and air, but providedlittle of either. Instead, the reminder of daylight and freedom was merelyanother aspect of the Norukai torture. Gripping the sweat-slick oars, Bannon’shands were covered with blisters. His voice was only a dry croak as he groaned.He couldn’t guess how long it would be before the hourly bucket of river waterwas passed around again, a ladleful splashed into their mouths.Bannon’s muscles throbbed from his biceps to his bones. The current of theKillraven River would pull them along, and the dark sails caught breezes, butKing Grieve insisted on greater speed, forcing the captives to sweat and bleedand die if necessary. While others begged, Bannon didn’t give the scarredraiders that satisfaction. The drumbeat pounded harder, and he strained to keepup.The oar master was a surly man named Bosko, prone to flatulence, which onlyincreased the stink in the confined space belowdecks. Tattoos and scars coveredhis face, but Bosko would have been ugly even without the mutilation.Sitting under the open hatch up to the main deck, he bellowed, “Harder, youworms! Lazy men will be hungry men. If you want your feast at noon, you’d betterwork up an appetite.” He laughed, flinging his scarred mouth wide.Bannon’s stomach recoiled at the thought of the rancid fish guts they wouldshove into his mouth. He had been starving for so many days, and he would forcehimself to swallow the nourishment, no matter the awful taste.The big miserable man chained next to him whimpered. His shoulders hunched andshook, and his hands were loose on the oar. Bannon whispered, “Please row—helpme. If they think you’re lazy, they’ll chop off your hands, and I don’t wantthat to happen to you.” The man flinched as if Bannon’s words were as sharp as aNorukai whip. “Trust me, stick with me. We’ll get through this.”Sullen, the big man gripped the oar shaft and pulled, though he couldn’tarticulate words.The man, Erik, was one of the new captives taken two nights ago when the serpentships had raided a small peaceful village. When the raid had launched, Chalkremained behind on deck, bouncing with excitement as he watched King Grieveswing his war axe and lead his fighters. “The axe cleaves the wood! The swordcleaves the bone!” the albino called out. He had looked at Bannon as if thewords had special meaning. From the deck of the main ship, Bannon had watchedthe ruthless Norukai ransack and burn. He wished he had Sturdy, or even a stick,to smash Chalk’s face, or King Grieve, or the shipwright Gara, or the oar masterBosko. Any Norukai would do.They had pillaged the settlement, seizing supplies, burning homes, slaughteringchildren, raping women. They had also captured a handful of strong, healthypeople, including Erik, to press into slavery. After the serpent ships set offagain, Bannon was glad to learn that several of the Norukai had not come back,so the villagers must have put up unexpected resistance.Now, Bannon and Erik were chained together on this bench, though they had fewopportunities to talk. The big man was drowning in grief. “You’ve got to work sothey don’t kill you,” Bannon urged him. “I know it’s terrible, and I can onlyguess at what you’ve lost, but don’t give up. Keep watching for your chance toescape. You’ll know when the time comes.”Still sobbing, Erik nodded. “They’re all dead. . . .”Bannon tried to think of a way to give the poor man strength. “Getting killedwon’t bring your family back. The Norukai won’t tolerate insubordination. We’reno more than a haul of fish to them.”“I hate them.” Erik had shaggy brown hair and a beard, a square face, broadshoulders. The raiders had killed his wife and two children, but captured himbecause he looked like a strong worker. “I hate them,” he repeated.“We have that much in common. Sweet Sea Mother, we will find some way out ofthis. Stick with me, and don’t give up.”A looming shadow appeared at the hatch above, and King Grieve shouted down intothe hold. The oar master stopped drumming so the king’s words could be heard.“You are beaten. You are slaves. You serve the Norukai. Your lives are ours, andwe can take your lives whenever we like, if you don’t work.”The chained men slumped on the benches. Bannon held his silence, though a flareof anger made his skin feel hot. Erik tried to stifle his weeping. Bannon wantedto comfort the man, but he could only offer empty hope and his own optimism. Hecomforted himself with the promise that he would kill as many of the Norukai ashe could.Bosko lifted a ladle of clean water from a wooden bucket at his side and slurpeda drink for himself as he eyed the captives who looked desperately at theliquid. Without the least bit of embarrassment, he passed gas in a loud burst.Grieve glared at the oar master from the deck above. “Why did you stop drumming?Keep the ship moving.”Bosko pounded out the beat again at an even faster pace than before.After Grieve retreated from the upper hatch, a spidery shape dropped down on thewooden ladder, peering into the smelly place. Chalk scuttled into the hold,where his bare feet splashed in the puddles of bilge that collected there.“Row, row, row! Down the river we go. You’ll all grieve!” He stopped abruptlywhen he saw Bannon chained to the bench. With mincing footsteps, he came totorment the young man, though he seemed to consider it conversation. “You liketo row? Off we go!”“I hate to row,” Bannon said, then thought of Ian as well as Erik’s family, allof the victims the raiders had left in their wake. “I hate the Norukai. Can youunderstand why?”With a grave expression, Chalk bobbed his head on his bony neck. “Some Norukaiare not nice.”Erik shrank away from the scrawny albino, but Chalk’s attention remainedentirely on Bannon. He took a seat on a sharp edge of the adjacent bench,squirming to find a comfortable spot, as if this were merely an afternoon in thepark and they were two friends chatting.“I want all Norukai to die,” Bannon said.“Even me?” Chalk said. “I’m your friend.”He paused in his rowing. “Friend? I’m chained here as a slave!”“I give you fish,” Chalk said.“You give me fish guts.”“Moist and tender fish guts.” He licked his lips. “They are good! They are whatI eat.”“Leave me alone.” Bannon bent to his rowing because that was better than thealbino’s taunting. Next to him, Erik groaned and sniffled.As if jilted, Chalk frowned. “If you don’t like my fish guts, then I’ll giveyour portion to him.” He looked indignantly at the new captive. The thought onlymade Erik moan even more.“Why do you keep pestering me?” Bannon asked. Was this creature some kind ofstrange ally? “You don’t see how cruel King Grieve is, how cruel you all are,the pain you’ve caused.”Erik found the courage to echo the words, “I hate you all.” The other slavesmuttered as well, all of them listening.Chalk was surprised and curious, as if he honestly hadn’t considered the idea.“Why? Why do you hate?” From the expression on the albino’s face, he seemed tobe expecting an answer.Bannon was surprised. “You honestly don’t know? You can’t see the terriblethings you’ve done?”“Terrible? We are Norukai. This is what we do.” He scratched his hideouslyscarred chest. “Would you have us be different?”“Yes!” Bannon wasn’t sure how he could get through to the odd man. “The Norukaitried to capture me when I was a boy, but I got away. They took my friend Ianinstead, sold him to Ildakar as a slave for the combat arena. He spent all hislife being tortured and trained.”“Ah, a champion,” Chalk said.“A slave!”The shaman remained perplexed. “If he was captured, why do you feel sorry forhim? That means he was weak. If he fought in a combat arena, he must have had aglorious life. I know about Ildakar. Yes, yes, Ildakar! Gone now.” He frowned,tugged on his scarred lip. “What did your friend expect?”“Ian expected a life!”Chalk scratched his straggly white hair. “A life? If he was a champion, whatbetter life is there? Maybe he could have been a Norukai warrior instead. Wouldthat have been a better life?”“No! He could have lived on Chiriya Island. He could have married, had a wife,children, a nice home.” Bannon sighed with the sadness of lost hopes for hisfriend.Chalk made a rude noise. “Weak. Sounds weak. I think he must have been strong.”“If he had stayed home, he would have been loved,” Bannon said. “I loved him. Hewas my friend, and the Norukai took all that away. He would have had a muchbetter life.”“Love . . .” Chalk frowned. “Not everyone has love. Not poor Chalk. Do we alldeserve love?”“Yes, we all deserve love,” Bannon said, “even if someone else takes it away.”“I have never known love. I don’t understand it.”“You don’t understand a lot of things.”The shaman found that hilariously funny and said in a singsong voice, “Love,love! Grieve, Grieve! You’ll all grieve. No love for me, I’ve seen it. No lovefor me.”Chalk seemed entirely convinced, and Bannon felt an odd moment of twistedsympathy. The countless bite marks and rough scars on the smooth white skin madethe shaman repulsive. In frustration, Bannon asked, “Why do you keep botheringme? Why am I special?”“The axe cleaves the wood. The sword cleaves the bone!” Chalk tapped his temple.“Because you’re in my head and maybe by talking to you I can get you out.” Hepaused to consider. “You’ll all grieve. Sailing, sailing, sailing!” As if heheard some hidden whistle, Chalk bounced off the bench. “Talk later. For now,row, row, row! Soon, we’ll be out on the shining sea again.”Leaving Bannon baffled, the albino scrambled along the underdeck, ducking loweven though he was much shorter than the beams. He climbed the ladder to theopen air, while the slaves looked longingly after him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 [part0003.html#a7]As Adessa continued north along the river, the channel widened to create a mazeof marshes, tall reeds interspersed with sluggish rivulets and stagnant pools.Carrying her stained sack, she splashed along, stepping on grassy hummocks orsliding into loose muck. Once, she sank up to her waist in a slurry of silt, butshe hauled herself out, disappointed in her clumsiness. If she wasn’t careful,she might lose her trophy. She had carried the wizard commander’s head for manymiles and many days. Adessa was eager to see the expression of warm gratitude onThora’s face when she opened the sack and pulled out the rotting horror.As she made her way through the marsh, she felt the bloated burden at her hip.By now, Maxim’s head was growing softer, squishier. The marsh was full ofunpleasant odors, but the sweet nauseating stench of decay hung like a cloud.She skirted several fishing towns at bends in the river, not wanting questionsor company. The closer she got to Ildakar, the more threatening the swamps wouldbe, the deadlier the predators. For now, she wanted to make good time.She pressed her fingers against the sack to feel her victim’s clumped hair, theoozing skin. Liquid seeped through the fabric, making a new stain of pus andspoiled blood.“Do you remember these marshes?” she asked aloud. “That town where you thoughtyou were safe? Tarada, I think it was called. I killed your followers there, andyou ran.” She paused, expecting his mouth to move and speak. “What? No reply?”Sure that she had not imagined it the first time, she kept trying to provoke thewizard commander’s spirit to come again. She knew for certain that Maxim’s eyeshad opened, that he had truly spoken to her. Since then, she had kept the headtied inside the sack to stifle his reanimation.But Maxim could not speak to her because he was dead! It must have been herimagination. And even if the wizard commander did utter words, he was defeated.He had nothing to say to her.That night Adessa made a solitary camp on a hummock of brown grass and peat,where she could sleep. Setting the sack in the matted grass, she found a deadswamp oak with wood rotten enough that she could break off the branches. Shepiled the twigs and dry grasses to start a fire. The orange flames were the onlylight for as far as she could see. Adessa heard the constant buzzing of marshinsects, night birds, and slithering creatures that hunted in the darkness. Shesat cross-legged on a mossy rock that was solid, if not comfortable. Adessaneeded no comfort.She peeled thick reeds and roasted the bland but edible pulp. She had foundberries during the day, even killed a small marsh hare with a thrown knife,which she now skinned and roasted. It was enough to satisfy.Maxim’s head remained wrapped in the sack, but she couldn’t tear her eyes fromit. She saw only the lumpy outline inside the fabric, but she knew that he wasstaring at her with jellied eyes. His puffy purplish lips would be twisted in amocking smile.She heard a whispered voice above the undertone of swamp sounds. “You can’t hidefrom me by keeping me in this sack.”“You cannot speak.”“Then why are you answering me?”“You’re dead.”“I don’t dispute that fact.”“Then stop talking to me!” She bit into the roasted rabbit leg so viciously thatshe broke the bone between her teeth. She spat out the hard shards.“I am still the wizard commander.” Maxim’s voice was muffled by the sack. “Youtricked me, surprised me. That was the only way you were able to kill me, but Istill have great powers you can’t understand.”Adessa lurched over to yank open the sack. She pulled out the head. “Be quiet!”His blackened skin sagged in all the wrong places, and his oozing eyes camebright and alive, turning toward her. “I merely thought you might like someconversation. No need to be rude. It’s lonely out here in the swamps, and youdon’t have any company.” His gruesome face grinned at her. One of his looseteeth fell from his gums and dropped into the grass. “My many lovers have toldme I’m very good company.”“I don’t want your conversation.”“I know what you fear, dear Adessa. You’re afraid that you might be going mad.”“I’m not mad!”Maxim’s lips parted. “Would a sane woman talk to a rotting head in the middle ofa swamp?” His smile broadened so that the decaying skin cracked and yellowishpus ran down into his goatee. “Would a sane woman hear him answer?”She carried her grisly trophy to a stagnant eddy at the edge of the hummock andsubmerged the head. “Now I don’t have to hear you.” She stood up, smug.Through the still water she could see Maxim’s eyes looking up at her, but hismouth made no sound.Satisfied, she went back to her meal, finished the rabbit with a handful ofberries, but she couldn’t stop thinking about her trophy. She worried about thedecomposing head under the water. What if the current was stronger than sheexpected? What if he drifted away?She knelt on the edge of the grasses to check on the head. She was alarmed tosee half a dozen brown fingerlings nibbling on the decaying face. The littlefish darted in to peck at the open eyes, to eat flakes of putrid flesh. If thefish devoured what was left of the wizard commander, Adessa would have nothingmore than a skull to show Sovrena Thora!In disgust she plunged her hand into the water, and the fish scattered to hidein the reeds. Grasping his hair, she lifted the head back onto the grass. Someof the stains had rinsed off, but Maxim was no more attractive.Once out of the water again, he opened his mouth and continued the conversationas if he’d never been interrupted. “You will not make it back to Ildakar.”She snorted. “You said I would never kill you either, yet I succeeded in that.”“This is different. I told you before, by now Ildakar has fallen. The wizardsraised the shroud of eternity, and the city is gone. You have no home.”“I will still go there. I don’t believe you.”Maxim continued to taunt. “Even if you complete your journey, you will neverfind Thora. Alas, my dear wife is already dead. Her spirit is in theunderworld—I have seen her myself. The Keeper is quite happy to have her. Ithink he has a lot in common with the unpleasant bitch.”“You lie!” The thought of the sovrena being dead hurt Adessa more than any ofhis other statements. “You lie!”“Poor Adessa, am I not in a position to know? After all, I’m dead, too—as youyourself reminded me.”“Then stay dead. Stop speaking.”“The dead are not the same as they were, and I have drifted back and forththrough the veil. We arrogant wizards of Ildakar caused our own damage to theorder of the universe by turning General Utros and his army to stone. We stoleall those souls from the Keeper, held them away for centuries. The shroud ofeternity also kept our nobles out of the stream of time. But the Keeper ispatient. He will claim what he is owed. He will come for you too, Adessa.”“The Keeper always does,” she said. “You don’t frighten me.”“Maybe I’ll stay here to keep you company after all. Or maybe I can call theKeeper’s attention and have him come for you now.”“Be quiet!”Maxim laughed.Her voice rose to a shout, or maybe it was a scream. “Stop laughing!” Thoughtsechoed inside her head, and a dark inner doubt made her wonder about her sanity.The wizard commander and his insidious taunts would be enough to drive anymorazeth insane.The campfire crackled and popped as the flames hit a loose knot of wet wood.Trembling with anger, Adessa stuffed the head back into its sack, hoping thatwould shut the man’s mouth. “There, you can rot in the dark.”She heard a rustle in the underbrush nearby, a splash in the water, somethinglarge approaching. Wary, Adessa grabbed her short sword and stood by thecampfire. The movement didn’t sound like a marsh deer or a bear. She had thoughtthe campfire would keep large predators away. She crouched, holding her silence,her ears attuned to any sound.A lean mud-spattered woman stepped forward into the circle of firelight as ifshe feared nothing. Adessa was astonished to recognize the scant black leatheroutfit, the protective runes on the skin just like her own, the pale brown hair.“I didn’t expect to find you,” Lila said, “but I need your help.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 [part0003.html#a7]After darkness fell like a protective blanket over the ruins of Orogang, thepalace doors opened again. The Hidden People performed the same tasks they hadundertaken for countless generations, and they were no closer to defeating thezhiss.Nicci explored the streets, looking for something she could use. She understoodthe danger of the bloodthirsty cloud, but she could not stay here. Unlike theHidden People, Nicci was not satisfied with just waiting. Since the sliphrefused to answer, she needed to take supplies and head out on her own, thoughthe journey would take many days or weeks. But it was her only option if she hadany hope of intercepting General Utros and his army.In front of the statue, a group of twenty men and women practiced with swordsfrom the armory vault. Nicci watched them with a skeptical eye. They had sparredwith one another for so long, using the same skills and moves, but they hadnever battled a real opponent. She realized that if Cyrus and his zealousfollowers actually joined Utros somehow, then they would become her enemy. Theydidn’t understand their own legends.Nicci spent the night searching the wide streets and plazas, the emptypassageways and alleys. The sliph well remained silent. The bowl-shapedamphitheater was like a deep crater in the middle of the city, and Nicci stoodon the outer rim, looking down. She imagined Kurgan down there skinning Majelalive and then planting flesh beetles in her wounds. No wonder the people hadrisen up and overthrown him, pulled down and smashed his towering statue.Suddenly, she sensed another presence nearby, powerful and dangerous. Shesnatched one of the daggers from her waist as a tan shadow leaped over acollapsed marble column. The big cat bounded toward her, and Nicci gasped,opening her arms wide. The sand panther drove her backward with momentum andexuberance, then licked her face with a raspy tongue. Laughing, Nicci wrappedher arms around Mrra’s neck. Pulling away, the cat paced around her, rubbing herfur against Nicci’s black dress, nearly knocking her over again. An ominous purrrumbled through her chest.“Mrra, you’re back!” Nicci held the big predator tight. She had lost so much,been through such ordeals, that just having her sister panther gave her greatreassurance. “Oh, Mrra! I can’t imagine how far you’ve come.” She pressed hercheek against the soft fur.When she saw more movement at the edge of the plaza, she realized that othercats had entered the city, a dozen or more. Their glowing eyes gleamed in theshadows of the ruins, but they did not venture closer, even though Mrra hadconvinced them to join her pride.“The people in this city are my friends, Mrra,” Nicci explained. “Allies. Yoursand panthers must not harm them. They are not prey.” She concentrated hard,hoping that Mrra could communicate the warning to the other panthers.Across the city Nicci heard the Hidden People raising their voices, and she sawa faint glow outlining the eastern mountains. Daybreak. Recalling what hadhappened to the two hapless deer, she felt sudden alarm. “Mrra, we have to getinside. You can shelter in the palace with me and my friends.” She tugged on thepanther’s neck. “You need to tell the others to hide, though.” She summoned animage in her mind of the deadly zhiss swarm that would appear with the sunrise.Under normal circumstances, sand panthers would bed down in a dark protectedarea during the day, but she felt a great sense of urgency. “Tell them, Mrra!This is important.”When her sister panther roared, the other cats twitched their tails, flashed alast feline glance at Nicci, and bounded off into the ruins in search of ashadowy lair. Nicci hurried with Mrra back to the palace entrance. Cora and theHidden People looked at the predator with alarm, drawing back as Nicci led Mrrainside. “She is mine. She won’t hurt you.”The drab people withdrew as she took Mrra inside the sheltered corridors beforethe sun spilled over the mountains. Throughout the ruined city, barricadesslammed into place, entryways sealed to hide from the sun. In a rush, the HiddenPeople pulled shut the palace doors.In a last glimpse, Nicci saw the swirling black cloud flowing into Orogang likea million wasps.Mrra growled, and Nicci held her sister panther as the Hidden People barred thedoor.*The wild cat did not like being trapped inside the stone walls. Mrra was hauntedby horrific memories of being tortured and trained by Chief Handler Ivan.Through her spell bond, Nicci saw memory flashes of the young cub clawing andbiting the iron bars of her cage. Back then, the only freedom Mrra and hersister panthers had experienced was when they were turned loose onto the bloodyarena sands. Now, she longed to be outside.But Nicci knew what the zhiss would do to any living creature they encountered.She stroked the panther’s tan fur, running her fingertips along the branded runescars. “I need to keep you safe. Trust me.”Today, the Hidden People seemed tense and fearful, but it had nothing to do withthe big panther locked inside with them. They were preparing to do somethingNicci had not seen before. A group of the muttering people moved to thebarricaded entrance. Young Asha caught Nicci’s eye and hurried in among thenervous gray-robed men and women.Intrigued, Nicci followed them to the closed main door, where one middle-agedman stood alone, facing the rest of them. He had a worn expression and sad browneyes. He braced himself and ate a mouthful of the fleshy, poisonous mushrooms asif for extra energy.The Hidden People looked at him with reverence. Several touched him on the arm.“Thank you, Cal.”“We appreciate you, Cal,” said another.A drab woman kissed him on the cheek. “Oh, Cal . . .” She couldn’t form anyother words.Nicci didn’t understand what was happening. Cal swallowed the poison fungus andturned to the barricade, as if in a trance. Two men lifted the crossbar as hestood at the door, trembling.Nicci realized they were going to let this man out into the sun. Mrra’s tailthrashed, and a low growl filled her throat, but Nicci rested a hand on thefurred shoulders to calm her. “What is he doing?” Nicci asked Cora. “You’reletting him out? What about the zhiss?”The old woman turned to her, and Nicci saw tears filling the wrinkle tracks inher cheeks. “We’ve had to do this every month. It is the only way we keep thezhiss under control.”The men pulled hard on the heavy doors and opened them to let an axe blade ofsunlight spill into the gloom. Cal turned to the gathered people. “Farewell. I—”His voice cracked. He dashed into the bright morning, pulling the hood over hishead like a man darting into a downpour. The Hidden People pressed closer towatch.Once away from the great building, Cal paused out in the open sunshine, filledwith wonder. Turning slowly, he pulled down his hood and lifted his face to thesky. He squinted in the blinding sun, but reveled in the warm light.“What is that man doing? Why is he sacrificing himself?” Nicci fought back theurge to push past these people and rush out to rescue him. “What will heaccomplish? The zhiss will feed on him.”Cora narrowed her eyes. “We are counting on it.”The man walked placidly to the middle of the plaza near the toppled statue ofKurgan, where he stripped off his gray robe and tossed the garment away. Hispale skin was milky, translucent, his face filled with rapture. He spread hisarms, felt the sunlight, touched his bare chest. “This is my payment! Oh, whatglory the sun is!”Inside, the muttering people fell into a hush as Nicci heard a buzzing soundthat grated her teeth, her spine. Mrra’s growl grew louder, and her earsflattened.Flowing among the high buildings like a shapeless predator, the black swarmapproached, thousands of black specks. Cal kept his eyes closed, refusing tolook at the deadly cloud as he drank in the sun. The swarm swirled and knotted,then rolled forward, picking up speed.“They’ll drain him dry,” Nicci said. “You said that if the zhiss feed on humanblood, their numbers will increase dramatically.”“Not with our blood.” Cora gestured outside. “Watch.”Obviously agitated, the black cloud was ravenous as it closed in on its victim.Cal faced it and knotted his hands into fists. He howled in defiance as thezhiss swarmed over him, covering his body like a thousand biting black flies,coalescing as they had done around the two unfortunate deer. Within moments, theman was just a vaguely human shape cloaked in black.Flailing about, Cal dropped to his knees and then collapsed face-first onto theflagstones. More zhiss pounced in to drink deep of the blood. The buzzing grewlouder, like a brewing thunderstorm.Once they had gorged themselves, the individual specks rose up from the bodylike fat raindrops. The dark red globules wavered, a cloud heavy with Cal’sblood. But instead of drifting off, as they had done after draining the deer,they became discolored. The crimson from Cal’s blood turned a sick brownishpurple. Hundreds, thousands of the floating zhiss swelled, wobbled like driftingpustules, and burst in the air, splattering dark stains across the plaza. Everyone of the zhiss that had fed upon Cal suffered, swelled up, and died.“Because we spend our lives eating the poison fungus, our flesh and blood isdeadly to them,” Cora explained. “Individually, the zhiss have no minds, onlyinstinct. This is how we keep the swarm in check. Cal just destroyed a good partof them. We choose a new sacrifice every month to curtail the growth of thecloud.” The old woman continued to stare longingly into the sunshine. “The zhisslearn their lesson for a time, and then they forget.”Nicci watched the flickering black cloud disperse, the surviving zhiss aimlesslyflying away from the desiccated body.“All of our generations have been a sacrifice,” Cora continued. “Someday, I willdraw the marked token, and I’ll go out to surrender my life just as Cal did. Weonly hope there will be enough of us in Orogang to keep the zhiss from prowlingelsewhere.”When part of the black cloud wandered toward the palace, the Hidden People swungshut the door and lowered the crossbar into place.Asha came up, her eyes sparkling. “It is our sworn duty, even if no one elseknows what we do.”“I know what you do,” Nicci said. “But you don’t know how to destroy them. Ifyou’re all committed to destroying them, why don’t you send fifty people outthere in a single sacrifice? If you each destroy as many of the zhiss as Caldid, then surely that would eradicate the whole swarm.”“We’ve tried that, many times,” the old woman said, shaking her head. “Some ofthe zhiss are fooled, but the others flit away. Many of us died, and still theblack cloud returns.”Asha pulled on Nicci’s arm, pleading. Her pale cheeks were streaked with dryingtracks of tears. “You are a great sorceress, Nicci. Can you help us? Can youfind a way to destroy the zhiss?” She hung her head. “Or will you just leaveus?”After growing impatient with these sullen, passive people, Nicci had almost madeup her mind to set off on foot. She could not ignore the threat that GeneralUtros posed, but now she also had a different perspective on the danger posed bythe zhiss. If the deadly black cloud ever left this ruined city and swarmedoverland to engulf other human settlements, doubling in size each time, theentire world could be covered in a black, blood-drinking shroud.Nicci recalled what the witch woman Red had written in Nathan’s life book, longago: And the Sorceress must save the world. She had accepted that mission forher own reasons. After Richard showed her a different way to live, a differentrole to play, her heart of black ice had melted enough to allow love and duty.And the Sorceress must save the world.Nicci saw the tentative hope on their faces. “I will find a way.” She let nodoubt creep into her voice or into her heart. When Nicci made up her mind to dothe impossible, she usually succeeded. “I will find a way.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 [part0003.html#a7]With an escort of a thousand mounted soldiers, General Utros headed north insearch of his lost capital. At the front of the expedition, he rode an imposingblack stallion fitted with a black saddle of embossed leather with polishedbrass studs.Utros maintained a brisk pace, searching for old imperial roads, which hadweathered away over time. They had crossed this terrain fifteen centuriesbefore, but the details of the landscape were fresh in his mind.“It seems like only months ago, beloved Utros.” Ava rode a bay mare beside him.The painted, hairless sorceress sat high in her saddle, her fingers woven intothe horse’s mane. Her loose blue gown rippled in the breezes.Ruva rode an identical bay mare on his other side. “But now the roads areovergrown, and forests cover the lands that we once dominated.”“We will conquer them again.” Utros ran a finger under the gold mask to wipeaway sweat. He nudged the stallion with his heels. “And this time, I will do itfor myself, not for Iron Fang.”Fifteen centuries ago, with the entire army behind him, he had led a slow marchacross the continent, subjugating town after town. Some foolish leadersresisted, and they all died. More importantly, the vanquished rulers served as alesson. Utros made sure they were executed in the most hideous and painful ways,slowly eviscerating the upstarts, burning them alive over low fires until theywere smoked like venison sausages hung for the winter. The tales of theatrocities spread swiftly, which extinguished defiance among those who mightconsider resisting.It was a careful strategic calculation. Unlike Iron Fang, Utros was not asadistic man, and he did not enjoy causing such pain, but he realized themilitary necessity of it. After he committed just a few horrific atrocities, theother leaders could not surrender fast enough, and thus he saved lives. When hisarmy rolled onward and his legend grew, he easily vanquished the next city andthe next with little bloodshed. Even large walled citadels threw open theirgates when his army marched near.Until he reached the most difficult target: Ildakar.Now the hot sun shone down on the soldiers as they rode back to their lostcapital. Many of these men were conscripts recruited from conquered towns, andthey had never seen Orogang, while others were hardened members from theimperial army, originally trained in the great capital city. They had families,sisters, wives, and mistresses back home—all long dead now, just as the soldiersthemselves should have died in the natural order of things. Those men rememberedOrogang, and Utros could sense their excitement as they rode toward the familiargray mountains, knowing they were getting closer, mile after mile.He thought of Kurgan’s enormous palace, with its towers and banners, its crystalwindows, its plazas and statues, and the sunken amphitheater from which theemperor would address throngs of his citizens. Great bronze bells would ringfanfares to celebrate Kurgan’s every announcement. Conquered cities and kingdomswould send tributes, and such new wealth would pay for all of his extravagance.The twin sorceresses couldn’t wait to see the city with their own eyes. “Mysister and I only knew our small village,” Ruva said.“Is Orogang grander than Ildakar?” Ava asked.“Orogang is Orogang, the capital of my empire.” Utros straightened. “Of courseit is grander.”Fixing his gaze on the line of mountains still many days’ ride away, Utros said,“I have often imagined what would happen when I returned to Orogang with thereport of my triumphs. I was sure Emperor Kurgan would praise me for thevictory.” His heart felt heavy, and he couldn’t speak the words. Regretfulthoughts surrounded him. “I did it for him. Loyalty is greater than love.”“You also did it for Majel,” Ava added. “Do not fool yourself, beloved Utros. Weknow you, and we know your heart.”Utros stared ahead as his black stallion toiled onward. “Yes, for her,” hewhispered. “Keeper and spirits . . .”Though he knew their passion was forbidden, even on the bloodiest battlefield hethought of her, the soft skin, her long black tresses, her brown almond-shapedeyes. Iron Fang had been his emperor, but Majel had been his love.He lifted his chin and spoke with a raw edge. “I also did it for him. I swore myloyalty, and I served my emperor.”Honor had been his armor, a shield that protected him from indecision, but hishonor had also blinded him to Iron Fang’s incompetence and petulant evil. Nowonder the man’s own wife had sought solace in the arms of another man. Majelhad truly loved him, but centuries in the underworld had changed her. Throughthe blood lens his sorceresses had created, he had seen Majel stripped of herskin, her face peeled off to expose her teeth and staring bloodshot eyes.Speaking to him through the veil, Majel’s spirit had spurned Utros andreaffirmed her devotion for the very man who had done those horrors to her.Utros knew that his dear Majel was not just dead, but dead to him.Now he couldn’t shake away the thoughts. After the last battle at Ildakar, whenhis army had suffered such devastating losses, the sour spirit of Emperor Kurganhad taunted him from the underworld, and Utros had smashed the blood lens,forever breaking contact with Iron Fang and with Majel. Now he was on his own,and his determination had not faded, merely shifted. He still intended toconquer the land, but it would no longer be for Emperor Kurgan.“I don’t know what we will find in Orogang,” Utros said as they rode into thehills. “I’m a soldier of the empire, whatever remains of it. Iron Fang was aterrible leader, but if the current emperor is worthy, then I will swear myloyalty to him. If he is not worthy . . .” Utros looked at the two women, whogazed at him with yearning expressions. “If he is not, then I will claim thethrone for myself, as I should have done all those years ago.”*That night, when the army camped in a sparse birch forest, Utros tried to sleepin his command tent. As he closed his eyes, he pondered Orogang. The capitalcity had surely grown over the centuries, but he would recognize the towers, thelooming buildings. Would anyone even remember General Utros from so manycenturies past? The wizard Nathan had said that his name was legend, but whatelse had transpired in the empire after all that time?Ava and Ruva remained outside by the fire, adding powders to the smoke, shapingand sending wisps among the sleeping soldiers to reinforce the preservationspell. Foraging hunters had killed deer, goats, rabbits, and squirrels, anythingto feed the ravenous troops. Some of the more intensely desperate soldiersstripped leaves from trees, ate the fleshy stalks of plants, even tall grasses.Once this escort army reached Orogang, they could feast and resupply. That waswhat Utros held on to.Orogang . . . In his mind the capital was breathtakingly beautiful, home to thelavish palace, the throne, banquet halls, meeting chambers, and high balconiesfrom which Iron Fang had commanded his subjects. He also remembered the hiddenrooms where he and sweet Majel had spent hours reveling in each other, touching,kissing, without fear of discovery. . . .Now, as Utros lay on his sleeping pallet, he touched the hard scar that was theleft side of his face. His gold mask rested on a nearby wooden table. Hishideous face made him think of the mangled horror Majel had become, but in hismemories, she was as beautiful as ever, and he was just as handsome.He slept, but woke in the dead of night after the moon had set and the campquieted. Outside his tent, he heard only the low rustle of sleeping soldiers andstirring horses. When he opened his eyes, he was startled to find a womanstanding before him. He could see her silhouette in the dim light of lowcampfires that penetrated the fabric of the tent. Long dark hair fell down overher shoulders. He recognized her shapely figure, the curve of her hips, thenarrow waist.He sat up instantly. “Majel?”She placed a finger to her lips and came closer. She raised her hands to herchest and undid the laces on the front of her filmy gown. She shrugged it off,letting the garment pool around her feet. Her naked breasts were full androunded with caramel-colored nipples. Somehow the light grew brighter so that hecould see her skin, the familiar mole just under the curve of her left breast,the implanted ruby in her navel.“Majel?” He kept his voice to an awed whisper.“Beloved Utros.” She leaned over him, kissing the smooth skin of his brow justabove his scarred face.He could smell her warm breath. “It can’t be you.”“I am here if you want me to be,” she said. “You should have been dead centuriesago, like me, but the rules have changed. Accept that.” She pressed her handsagainst his shoulders, forced him to lie back on the pallet. She caressed hischest, stroked the fine hair.“I saw you in the blood lens,” he said. “Your face.”“My face is beautiful, as is yours.” She kissed him on the lips, silencingfurther questions. Majel climbed on top of him, and he wrapped his large handsaround her waist, feeling the real solidity of this beautiful woman. A flood ofmemories came back, all the times they had made love, but this time heexperienced only joy and relief, rather than fear of being caught. Majel wassomehow back from the underworld, and she was here with him.He twisted his fingers through her hair so he could pull her face closer to his,and he kissed her again savagely. Majel purred into his ear, then reached downto stroke his thigh. She nudged his legs so she could settle herself on top ofhim. He groaned as he slid inside, and her smile was filled with deliciousrapture. For a moment, just a moment, Utros let himself revel in the dream, surethat it was real but unable to understand.“This is what you need, beloved Utros,” Majel said as she began rocking back andforth. He ran his hands along her back, coaxing her.Beloved Utros . . .Majel had never called him that. Her pet name for Utros had been “my commander.”When they engaged in rough play, she would instruct him to command her. Heractions now struck him as different, her movements not the familiar interchangeof bodies they had developed after pleasuring each other so many times.Beloved Utros.He grabbed her shoulders and looked intensely at her. “You are not Majel.”“I can be,” she said.He pushed her aside. “You’re not Majel!”The woman slid off of him and retreated. When she raised her hands, her bodyshifted to become a form that was still slender and shapely, but pale andcovered with splashes of color. The long hair vanished.Ava stood naked before him, tracing one of the painted spell patterns along herflat stomach. “I knew what you wanted, beloved Utros. Through me or my sister,you can have Majel again any time you like.”“I can never have her again! I do not want an imitation. My Majel was murderedby her own husband. Her spirit is locked in the underworld, and she renouncedher love for me to stand by him.”“I was just trying to give you love, love that you seem to need.” She reachedout to console him, but he pushed her hand away.“I do not need love,” Utros vowed. “I need to conquer, and I intend to do so.”He felt deep anger and disappointment, but he knew what Ava had done and why. Hecouldn’t hate her for it. “I need you and Ruva. You both are indispensable tome, but I don’t need . . . this.” He gestured to her beautiful body.“As you wish.” Ava retreated to the tent opening and stood there in the faintlight, naked and achingly beautiful. “Just remember that my sister and I willgive you whatever you need.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 [part0003.html#a7]As the main body of the ancient army pushed into the rising mountains, Nathanand the group of defenders made their plans for the field of deathrise flowers.General Zimmer’s scouts rode out to reconnoiter the enemy force, reporting ontheir progress climbing toward the meadow. Thorn and Lyesse indulged themselvesby killing stragglers from the giant army, which also provoked the vanguard tosurge after them.While waiting to spring their trap, Nathan scouted the sea of poisonous blossomsand the trees beyond. The flowers were beautiful, their colors as intense as thesilence, which was like death. On the other side of the meadow, an expansiveforest stretched into steeper terrain.He remembered when naive Bannon had come upon the deceptively pretty flowers andoffered a meager bouquet to Nicci, hoping to earn her favor. Recognizing thepoison, Nicci had calmly lectured the young man on the lethal leaves, stems, andblossoms, how even a drop of sap or a crushed blossom would kill him. Terrified,Bannon had dropped the flowers, relieved that he hadn’t accidentally touched anyof the juice. He had picked only a few of them, and this meadow containedthousands.“This will kill a lot of the enemy,” he said to Prelate Verna, “if we can trickthem into running across the meadow.”“I understand it’s a horrible death,” she said.“The most horrible imaginable,” Nathan mused, stroking his chin. “And I canimagine many horrible deaths.”“It’s what they deserve,” Renn growled. Sadness still hung heavy in his eyes. “Iwant to march them all through this meadow so that they die screaming. I hopeGeneral Utros is with them, along with his sorceresses. They killed Lani.”Zimmer stepped up to them, frowning. “General Utros and both sorceresses havegone elsewhere. According to my scouts, First Commander Enoch is in charge ofthe army right now.” He flashed a dark grin. “We know this because our twomorazeth friends enjoy asking harsh questions of any scouts they capture.”Nathan and Verna stood at the edge of the deathrise field. “The army will streamthrough this hanging valley. We can provoke the vanguard, try to get them tochase us, and lead them right through this meadow. They’ll be exposed to thepoison, cover themselves in the deadly juices.”“As will we,” said the freed slave Rendell with a deeply worried look on hisseamed face. “How will we avoid dying?” Though ungifted, the old man had doneeverything he could to assist them in their flight. Rendell was remarkablyskilled in finding edible roots and berries, even shelf mushrooms that grew ontrees. Each night he managed to make a palatable meal with whatever he hadscavenged.Oron joined them. “If we can get through to the forest on the other side, a deepswift stream runs out of the mountains. We could wash off the poison—if we canget there in time.”“The poison would penetrate,” Nathan said. “We wouldn’t last that long.”“Then we will have to wear protection on our exposed skin,” said Olgya. “Withwrappings of the special silk I brought with me from Ildakar, we can cover ourhands, faces, and any exposed part of our legs or arms. It is wispy thin andimpenetrable.”Perri looked doubtful, her face creased with a worried expression that marredher otherwise pretty features. “Why not just go around the field without riskingourselves? We know the army is coming this way, and they are sure to stumbleacross the meadow. Some of them will die anyway as they cross it.”“They might even eat the flowers,” said the wizard Leo. “The scouts say that thearmy is stripping the grasses and leaves as they march, as if they were yaxen.”He rubbed his flat stomach beneath his robe. “How I miss fresh yaxen meat. WhenI worked the slaughterhouses, I could have a fine bloody steak whenever Iliked.”The soldiers nearby mumbled wistfully with their own hunger.Verna shook her head. “Those ancient soldiers may be familiar with deathriseflowers. We can’t give them a chance to think. If they’re chasing us, they’llfall into the trap.”“They want us,” Nathan said. “We have given them more than enough reason to wantrevenge for all we have done. We need to let them see us and then run, leadingthem directly through the flowers. We are protected, and they are not. I believethe rest will take care of itself.” Riled up by the constant hit-and-runtactics, he was certain that once the ancient army spotted their harassers, theywould charge recklessly ahead into the field of poisonous flowers.As the great army marched ever closer, the two morazeth would taunt the soldiersinto pursuing them at full speed, but with so much exposed skin, Thorn andLyesse could not be allowed near the meadow. Rather, they would vanish into thesurrounding forest as soon as the enemy warriors spotted Nathan and his handfulof gifted defenders waiting at the meadow. Zimmer’s soldiers could not help withthe trap; they retreated around the meadow and into the forest beyond, wherethey would wait for the group at the fast stream, and they would help dispatchany of the enemy who happened to make it through.In preparation, Nathan put on his high boots, ruffled shirt, and black pants,with his ornate sword strapped to his side. Over those garments, he donned hiswizard’s robe, which protected more of his skin. After that, he wrapped Olgya’ssilks around both hands up to his elbows and made a scarf for his neck and face,leaving only a slit for his nose and eyes. He bound his long hair in a ponytail.Verna, Renn, Oron, Olgya, and six of the gifted scholars wrapped themselves inthe same fashion, using all of her remaining silk fabric.With the vanguard of the ancient army fast approaching, Thorn and Lyesse trottedoff, eager to provoke the enemy. Everyone was ready. Nathan regarded thesilk-covered defenders. “We look like corpses wound in linen strips and ready tobe interred in catacombs.”“We will be nightmares to them, by the Keeper’s beard,” Renn said. He plucked athis silks, adjusting them over his tattered and stained maroon robe.That afternoon, after hours of unbearable waiting, the shouts finally came, theclash of swords, the rhythmic pounding of marching feet. Running hard, Thorn andLyesse burst out of the trees to the edge of the meadow. Both women had joy ontheir faces as they bounded along like fleet deer. When they saw Nathan and hissilk-wrapped companions standing ready in front of the deathrise field, themorazeth flashed glances at each other. “We will compare scores later,” Thornsaid to her partner. They bounded off to safety, racing around the edge of themeadow and into the trees.Nathan said, “It’s our turn now.”He called upon his gift and summoned a great wind that thrashed the branches.Beside him, Verna sent dazzling flashes of light into the trees to blind thefirst line of warriors just as they surged into the clearing. Oron, Leo, Perri,and Olgya joined forces to call a storm, drawing bullwhip lightning bolts thatkilled the first twenty soldiers who thought they were chasing only two women.Oron said, “They have to believe we’re cornered and making a last stand.”“A cornered animal is the most dangerous,” Renn said.As hundreds more of the yelling enemy rushed out of the trees, Nathan created aball of wizard’s fire and splashed it sideways. More of the enemy fell dead,screaming in agony from the incinerating flames.Nevertheless, the front ranks of the marching army raced ahead like wolvessmelling blood. When they saw the vulnerable defenders standing in front of thefield of flowers, they howled with excitement.Beneath the silk wrappings, Nathan smiled and spoke quietly through grittedteeth. “Come and get us.”For days the ragtag band had preyed upon the army, murdering stragglers, wipingout scouting parties. Even if the death toll was insignificant against theenormous numbers, fear and anger had worked itself into the minds of Utros’ssoldiers. At last facing their tormentors, the front ranks rushed forward,suspecting nothing.Renn’s voice was muffled through the silk as he summoned a blazing ball in hishand. “Wizard’s fire seems too clean and swift for them, but I’ll see them deadany way I can.” He splayed his fingers as he threw the crackling ball, whichshattered into separate pieces, each fragment striking the face of a helmetedwarrior, exploding their skulls. Renn laughed wildly. His grief over Lani hadbecome a vindictive weapon.The Cliffwall scholars summoned spells that made the ground tremble or hurledhard winds into the faces of the charging soldiers. The first ranks fell dead,but the second and third lines simply trampled over the fallen corpses as theyclosed in on the silk-wrapped defenders.Nathan saw they would swiftly be overwhelmed. “Run! It’s time.” He adjusted thecoverings on his hands, then turned about to charge into the sea of poisonousflowers.The ancient soldiers flooded out of the forest, and the line of rebels retreatedacross the meadow, the beautiful blossoms all around them. The moment seemedsurreal as Nathan ran for his life, his boots trampling the leaves, the stems,the colorful petals. Verna crashed beside him, her skirts flowing behind her.Leo, Perri, Oron, and Olgya threw a last wave of storm winds and lightning, justone more provocation, and then they also bounded through the colorful field,giddy and terrified.A defiant Renn was the last, killing them with whatever spells he could summon,and then he fled just before the enemy soldiers caught up with him.The meadow seemed to go on forever, and the flowers were an endless wave offresh color and lingering death. Verna stumbled and nearly fell face-first intothe blossoms, but Nathan snatched her collar and held her up, giving her amoment to regain her feet. The enemy soldiers roared in pursuit, convinced theyhad their victims in full retreat. The first wave charged at a full run,swinging their swords as they closed in on their prey. Oddly, some of theravenous soldiers paused to scoop up the poisonous flowers and devour them likestarving animals.Nathan put on a burst of speed toward the sheltering forest. He could hear thecrushing foliage, saw the people trampling countless flowers. His boots, the hemof his wizard’s robe, even the silks covering his hands must be tainted withpoison. He would have to scrub every bit of it off in the fast stream, if hemade it that far.He and Verna finally reached the other side of the meadow. They rushed into thetrees, scrambled over rocks, and topped a rise before they worked their way downinto a drainage, where a rushing stream tumbled over mossy rocks. Before hescrambled down the steep slope, Nathan glanced back to see the enemy soldierspouring across the meadow after them. The first ones were starting to staggerand drop among the deadly blossoms. Many did not make it halfway through themeadow, while others kept on, slowing, lurching, until they collapsed into thedeceptively colorful vegetation.As countless men died inexplicably, the rest of the army hesitated, piling up ina wary crowd at the outer edge of the meadow. A few made it all the way acrossthe field of flowers and reeled into the rocky forest, where they dropped amongthe trees, writhing and vomiting, clawing at their eyes.Nathan felt a grim pleasure as he watched them die. “Those flowers will make afine bouquet for your funeral.”Verna’s shout startled him out of his reverie. “Nathan, don’t just stare! Wehave to get to the stream and wash!”Without wasting breath on further words, they ran down the steep slope to thefast-flowing water, where General Zimmer and his soldiers waited beside all thehorses, weapons drawn and ready to fight any enemy who made it through. Nathanand his companions careened down the slope, slipping and stumbling on dry leavesand pine needles until they plunged into the rushing, cold stream. The currentwas frigid with snowmelt, but Nathan dove into the water, peeling the silks fromhis hands before the poison could soak through the special silk. He unwound thefabric from his face, then dunked his head into the stream and let his longwhite hair flow loose. Next, he stripped off his white robe and let it driftdown the stream. He would never wear the contaminated garment again.Verna, Oron, and Olgya scrubbed their hands in the silty stream bottom, washedtheir faces, wrung out their clothes. Gasping, spraying water from his mouth,Nathan looked up to see Renn stumble to the stream’s edge. The other wizardmoved slowly, his face aghast.“Into the water, Renn!” Nathan called. “Wash yourself! Get the poison off.”But Renn stared at his left hand, where the silken wrappings had slipped offwhile he charged through the flowers, and now the fabric hung loose on hiswrist. He looked at his palm, his fingers, the back of his hand, where the skinwas already covered with gray blisters. His wrists were swollen and red, hisknuckles puffy.“Oh no,” Renn said.*The sad defenders carried Renn’s body with them, not willing to give the fallenwizard an unmarked grave in an empty forest. They moved swiftly away from thedeathrise field, griefstruck.Behind them, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of the enemy soldiers had fallendead from the horrible poison in the meadow. The ancient army ground to a haltin shock as First Commander Enoch sent cautious scouts to find a safe route thatavoided the meadow. Eventually, the great force pushed on toward the rocky peaksthat led to the pass of Kol Adair.When Nathan and his companions had gone a safe distance from the enemy army,they found a sheltered hollow in the high forest, where they took the time tobuild a funeral pyre for Renn.Thorn and Lyesse patrolled, watching out for surprise attacks, while the rest ofthe group paid their respects to the fallen wizard. Captain Trevor and hisIldakaran guards were especially shaken, having escorted Renn to Cliffwall andback. Together, they watched the blaze burn, purifying his mortal remains.Nathan touched the scar on his chest and felt a twinge of Ivan’s anger, but hedrove it back and concentrated only on his respect for Renn."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 [part0003.html#a7]The three serpent ships cruised down the Killraven River past sluggish sidechannels and wide marshes. When a heavy breeze stretched the blue sails, theNorukai shipped the oars and let their captives sprawl on deck, tied in place.After being confined for so long in the hot and stinking hold, Bannon relishedthe small joy of open air. His skin was caked with sweat, dried fish slime, andblood. His pale skin burned easily under the sun, and his body was mottled withbruises.King Grieve strode along the deck to remind the slaves of his intimidatingpresence. Bannon hated everything about the man—the chain around his waist, theiron plates on his knuckles, the implanted spines in his shoulders, the awfulgash that sliced his mouth to the back of his head.Chalk followed the king like a loyal dog, jabbering, grinning. “My Grieve, KingGrieve, you’ll all grieve!” The king seemed comforted by the shaman’s presence,as if he were a pet.The big captive Erik sat beside Bannon, his knees drawn up to his broadshoulders, his head hung. Though Bannon had tried to keep him strong, the largeman remained in a daze of grief, walling himself off, as if to commune with thespirits of his slaughtered family. Bannon tried talking with the sullen captive,but rarely earned a response.Several Norukai ran excitedly to the stern of the ship, looking down into themuddy river. “Get us hooks,” one man cried. “Spears with ropes!”Trying to see what they were doing, Bannon tugged against his bindings, but eachmovement made him wince. More Norukai rushed to the rail with boat hooks,harpoons, weighted nets. Leaning over the side, they took turns hurling weaponsinto the water, as if it were some kind of sports contest.Drawn to the frenetic activity, Chalk pressed among the larger warriors,elbowing through so he could peer down. “Ah, fish! Big fish, monster fish! Fishmonsters.”“Get a hook in their gills,” Gara called down.Another Norukai groaned, “That one’s dead now, but we’re drifting too fast downthe channel. The damned thing is slipping away!”“Drop anchor,” King Grieve shouted. “It’s worth the stop. That’ll be enough foodto get us back home.”Chains rattled through slots as heavy anchor stones dropped into the river,sinking to the mud. Two other raiders climbed the mast and rolled up the sails,tying them to the yardarm. The other two serpent ships dropped anchor as well.“Channel catfish,” said oar master Bosko as he let out a loud burst of smellygas. “We’ll have a feast, by the serpent god!”They jabbed hooks and spears into the water, then hauled on the ropes. It tookthree straining Norukai to pull up the first flopping body.Though Bannon had lived on Chiriya Island, where fishermen brought back theirdaily catches, he had never seen such a huge fish before. Groaning and laughing,the Norukai heaved the beast over the rail and dropped it onto the deck with aloud thud. The catfish’s body was as long as a canoe, its crescent-moon mouthgaping, the wide-set eyes small, dark, and stupid. Long whiskers were likebarbed tentacles. Watery brown blood oozed from the wounds made by barbed hooksand serrated harpoons.Chalk could barely contain his excitement as he squatted in front of thecreature. He touched the slime that covered the catfish’s body and danced back,holding up his finger and licking it. The dying catfish twitched and thrashed,and the albino shaman skittered away from the sharp spines on its fins.“Fish bite, fish nibble,” he said, poking the countless small scars that coveredhis body. He grinned at Bannon as if the two were having a private conversation.“Stay away from the fish.”The Norukai threw more harpoons into the river and pulled up a second enormousfish. Before long, the mood on the ship brightened as the Norukai hauled a thirdmonster fish onto the deck, and they fell upon the creatures with their knives,sawing through the scaly hides to pull out the entrails. The catfish oozedpuddles of slime on the deck. One Norukai man received a deep cut from athrashing spine, and he retaliated by using his battle hammer to batter thefish’s head into pulp.Bannon felt queasy with the stench of the slime and blood, but Grieve regardedthe mess with pride. He raised his heavy war axe and with a single stoke cuthalfway through the catfish’s neck. The whiplike whiskers continued to twitch.Grieve hacked twice more until the head rolled loose, and Chalk clucked histongue in disappointment. “The axe cleaves the wood, the sword cleaves the bone!And King Grieve cuts the fish, monster fish. Fish monsters.”“Did you predict we would have a feast, Chalk?” Grieve asked.The albino dropped to his knees and thrust his hands into the open cavity fromwhich the guts had already been removed. “I predict . . . dinner!”The Norukai made swift work, peeling off the tough skin, cutting up the pinkishmeat. They were happy to eat the fish raw, and Grieve took a hunk for himself,chewing with his wide-hinged jaws. Before long, the three enormous carcasseswere stripped down to the bones, and men heaved the skeletons overboard into theriver.Once he had stuffed himself, Grieve became magnanimous. “Let the slaves feast,too, so they have more energy to work.”The Norukai threw piles of the slick red intestines and frilled gill membranesonto the tied captives. The stinking slime crawled down Bannon’s chest, but hisstomach growled. The raiders hadn’t fed him all day.A flare of anger ran through him. In the past, he sometimes lost control andflew into a fighting frenzy, a reckless wild man with no thought for his ownsafety. He controlled himself now, knowing that foolish resistance would onlyget him killed. He would rather kill them.He strained at the ropes around his wrists and grabbed a fleshy blob of organmeat. He chewed, tasting the muddy burst in his mouth, but he grimaced andswallowed.Chalk squatted next to Bannon, munching handfuls of raw meat. “Revenge on thefish! Fish tried to eat me, and now I eat the fish.”Bannon again noted the pockmarks on his skin. “What really happened to you? Whydo you have all those scars?”“Fish nibbled me,” Chalk said. “Wish the fish! Wish the fish! King Stern didn’tlike me. He threw me in a pool of razorfish, and they almost ate me, but Grievepulled me out. He saved me, took me to a healer. My Grieve, King Grieve, you’llall grieve!”Bannon tried to piece together the shaman’s ordeal from his patchwork words.Chalk had been sacrificed to a pool of carnivorous fish—because he was analbino? because he was odd?—and the fish had torn his skin to shreds before hewas rescued? No wonder he was so loyal to Grieve.The thought of what had happened twisted Bannon’s stomach, even eliciting an oddsympathy for the scarred and mentally disturbed man. Considering all the Norukaihad done to him, Bannon chastised himself for feeling sorry for Chalk, but thepale man had an odd longing in his eyes.The shaman glanced over his shoulder to the bow, where the king stood. “Nibble,nibble, nibble! Fish will nibble me still. Eat my flesh and bones when I die.”Chalk jammed more raw flesh into his mouth. “Now I eat the fish. Which ones willeat me, I wonder. . . .”Bannon ate as much of the catfish entrails as he could stand. Next to him, Eriksluggishly chewed a mouthful, but he looked sick. Trying to encourage hisfriend, he forced himself to set a good example and eat a little more. Erikdidn’t seem to notice.Impatient, the king bellowed out, “Enough wasted time. Set the sails and raiseanchor. Soon, we’ll reach the estuary and the open sea. We have a war to fight.”As the serpent ships got underway again, Grieve grimaced at the slime and bloodpooled across the deck. “Have the slaves clean this up. They need to earn thefeast we just gave them.”“Scrub!” The shipwright Gara handed Bannon a bucket and bristle brush. Sheraised a threatening fist. “Scrub to make you strong enough for fighting.”Bannon knew he would be strong enough to kill any Norukai who gave him thechance. As the serpent ships sailed on, he and the other slaves got to work."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 [part0003.html#a7]After watching the sacrifice of the man named Cal, Nicci now fully understoodthe explosive threat of the zhiss. She could not just abandon these people toseek another war, hoping they would manage to keep containing the bloodthirstyblack cloud. She had to find a way to stop the destructive force before it brokeloose and swarmed across the landscape. Nicci was not one to walk away and leavea problem unsolved.And the Sorceress must save the world.While sheltered inside during the day, Nicci called some of the Hidden Peopleinto Kurgan’s cavernous throne room. Restless, Mrra brushed against Nicci’s leg.Her black travel dress was swallowed up in the stark shadows of the torchlitchamber.She announced to the group without preamble, “I will help you find a way to stopor destroy the zhiss.” The big cat let out a growl, as if to agree with hersister panther’s new mission.The Hidden People sounded relieved and excited. Young Asha grinned. “I knew youwould!”With a satisfied expression, Cora nodded. “The legends said a hero would comeback and save us.”“It should be General Utros,” said Cyrus. “That was the prophecy.”“Would you prefer to wait for him?” Nicci snapped. “Or shall I try?”Cyrus frowned. “You may try.”“I tend to succeed.” Nicci did not boast of her past victories. She had killedJagang, she had helped Richard defeat Emperor Sulachan and his hordes. She haddestroyed the Lifedrinker as well as the violently uncontrolled Victoria. Shehad fought the twisted society of Ildakar, and she had clashed with GeneralUtros. The zhiss swarm was an entirely different danger.Nicci stepped onto the cold stone dais that had once held Iron Fang’s imposingthrone. “I am a sorceress, and I was once a Sister of the Dark. I can use boththe Additive and Subtractive sides of my gift. I don’t know what the zhiss areor where they came from, but I will find a way to stop them.”The shadowy people looked at her with hopeful expressions. They pulled backtheir gray hoods to reveal faces white from living in darkness, but theirexpressions now showed a spark of hope that she had not seen earlier. Mrrathrashed her tail, and a low rumble vibrated from her throat.Cora came forward to help. “We can tell you everything we know about them. Maybeit will give you what you need to find a solution.”*The Hidden People had studied the black swarm for generations, documenting theirobservations, their extrapolations, and several failed attempts to eradicate thezhiss. For more than five hundred years, they had poisoned their bodies with thetoxic fungus, but they had tried little else, simply clinging to the status quoand keeping the threat at least marginally under control.Cora brought her scrolls and bound journals, ledgers where witnesses hadrecorded their thoughts from generations earlier. Nicci pored over the words,dismissing anything that was not relevant. She had studied for many years in thePalace of the Prophets and also learned techniques that were forbidden.While the pale old woman made suggestions and pointed out important summaries,Nicci tried to devise a tactic that might work. She skimmed another account andmulled over what she knew. “They only come out during the day. They thrive underthe light and hide or go dormant in darkness.” She looked at Cora. “Do you knowwhere they go? How I can find their lair?”The old woman shook her head. A gray-brown strand of hair dangled down the sideof her wrinkled face.Nicci tried another idea. “Can we attract them at night? Could we call themhere, under our terms?”Cora reacted with horror. “Why would you do that? It is our only time ofsafety.”An idea began to form in Nicci’s mind. “Because in daylight they can goanywhere, but what if we found a way to attract them to a dark place and trapthem there?” Her lips curved in a hard smile. “That might be what we need.”The old woman looked disturbed. “How would you hold them? What could possiblycontain the zhiss?”Nicci raised her hand to indicate the stone walls. “Your artisans bricked up thearches and windows, sealed these buildings, and the zhiss can’t penetrate thewalls. A properly constructed stone structure could hold them in just as easilyas blocking them out. We could imprison them permanently, maybe starve them.”As she developed her plan, Nicci had to convince the Hidden People, for shewould need their help. Since she was a gifted sorceress, the primary work oftrapping and holding the zhiss would fall on her shoulders, but the HiddenPeople were a skilled workforce and she would need them all to pull together tocraft a permanent prison. Or an execution chamber. It would be a swift andambitious job, if she could contain the cloud long enough.When Nicci explained her idea, Cora said, “Many of us may die.”“You sacrifice one of your number every month just to keep them contained. Yourpeople have been dying here for centuries, to no good effect. My idea may put anend to the threat forever. Isn’t that what you want?”“It’s a risk we have to take,” the old woman admitted, “and I pray you succeed.”“So do I,” Nicci said under her breath. “You have never seen someone like me.”Over the course of planning, Nicci scouted the city every night, deciding on theright place to set her trap. She and Mrra prowled outside as soon as twilightfell. She required a large space to confine the swarming cloud, and the roundsunken amphitheater seemed perfect for her purposes.During their days inside the sealed buildings, the Hidden People scoured theimperial halls and chambers to find old mirrors that could be polished to brightreflectiveness, smooth sheets of gold and brass that gleamed in the torchlight.After all the preparations were made, Nicci began building what she called her“cauldron trap.”As soon as the sun went down, the Hidden People bustled around the stage at thebottom of the crater amphitheater, installing the mirrors, the reflective metalsheets, and angled crystals, all of which sent out rainbow shards of torchlight.The work crews took advantage of every hour of darkness. They filled the centerstage where Iron Fang had once shouted his speeches to a cowed populace. Theypiled a mound of dry wood, split logs, and thin branches, enough to make ablazing bonfire. All of the reflective surfaces would increase the brilliance ahundredfold.Even so, Nicci suspected the blaze wouldn’t be sufficient. With her gift, shewould add much more to create a dazzling, irresistible beacon. It would be asbright as the sun, bright enough to call the zhiss.When the preparations for the beacon were complete, Nicci ordered all of themaster artisans, masons, and stonecutters to prepare for a furious, desperatenight of work, stacking up all the supplies so they were ready at hand. OnceNicci did her part—if it worked—they would have only one chance and very littletime.By living inside the abandoned buildings every day, the Hidden People knew thearchitecture from the inside out. They understood how stones fit together, andthey knew how to build arches and vaulted ceilings. They could cut stone withgreat precision, and they knew the mixtures for fast-drying, permanent mortarand plaster that would endure for ages.After measuring the sunken amphitheater, their architects designed supportstruts and mapped out the blocks that would be needed. Though they rushed backinside each sunrise when the zhiss returned, the shadowy people worked withtremendous energy and increasing hope.Each night Mrra ran free, reuniting with the other sand panthers that lurked inthe mountains. The big cat made fresh kills and feasted with her new pride, butshe always returned to spend the day in the shadows with Nicci. Mrra could senseher sister panther’s restlessness, wanting to attack the formless black cloud,but Nicci couldn’t allow her to be in danger.When the preparations were at last complete, a tension built among the HiddenPeople. They watched the daylight wane through chinks in the barricaded windows.Nicci scratched the big cat behind the ears and led her into her own bedchamber,blocking her thoughts. She had a heavy heart, knowing that Mrra would see heractions as a betrayal.“I have to keep you safe,” Nicci whispered. “This is my fight. I need to makesure you stay here.” Mrra growled and tried to push past her to escape thechamber, but Nicci blocked her way. “I will come back for you.” She pulled thethick door shut, locking Mrra inside.Angry at her confinement, the panther thumped against the door. Loud scratchescame from the other side, along with a frustrated yowl. Nicci suspected that bythe time she returned—if she returned—the door would be torn to splinters. Shehad to move quickly.Nicci hurried through the corridors to where Hidden People had gathered. Corawaited with dozens of eager and nervous people at the towering palace doors,while other Hidden People lurked inside many secondary buildings. They wereready.“We have to wait until the darkest hour of the night,” Nicci said.Cyrus adjusted his gray cowl, frowning. “We’ve waited long enough.”“And tonight, if we are successful, your waiting will end.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 [part0003.html#a7]At midnight, before the waning moon rose over the mountains, Nicci led theHidden People out for their attack against the zhiss. Her beacon in the darknesswould be an irresistible summons to the horrible black cloud.She would eradicate the deadly swarm that had terrorized this city since thefall of Iron Fang’s empire. Once freed, the Hidden People could rebuild thecapital and turn Orogang into a trading hub again. They could name their ownleader to become part of the D’Haran Empire. Once she knew the zhiss were nolonger a threat, she would set off overland to find the army of General Utros.But only if her plan worked against the zhiss.Five of the gray people carried torches down the steps of the sunkenamphitheater and ignited the piled wood on the central stage. The flames caughtin the kindling and flared up, sending sparks that swirled like night wisps. Thebonfire snapped as it consumed the dry branches then fed upon the split logs.The flames danced and reflected on the array of mirrors and polished metalsurfaces placed in the concentric rings of seats around the sunken stage. Smokewrithed in the air and the fire stretched higher.Nicci stood on the topmost tier, watching the blaze grow. She had wrapped herblond hair and her face with scarves and veils, which she hoped would keep thezhiss away from her bare skin. She wore gloves on her hands, fabric windingsdown her legs. After lighting the bonfire, the Hidden People tossed theirtorches and backed up the steep ramps to street level. At the bottom of thecrater, the fire was definitely the brightest light in Orogang, but she wouldmake it even brighter. Irresistible.“Go,” she called to Cora and the others. “When the swarm comes, I want you allsafe.” She hoped the cloth wrapping her body would be enough protection, wouldgive her enough time.“But we need to help you, Nicci,” Asha said. “We can lure the zhiss into thepit. This is our battle, too.”“Leave that to me. The flames will be bright enough.” Nicci looked at thedetermined young woman. “You have made enough sacrifices.” She urged them toretreat, and the group backed away but did not lock themselves inside thebuildings.She descended to the bottom of the sunken amphitheater and approached the lowstage, which held the blaze. In order to draw the zhiss out of their lair, Niccineeded to make the bonfire many times brighter, a beacon to rival the sun, andso she drew upon her gift. She could summon wizard’s fire, one of the mostdramatic and deadly spells, but she didn’t need such destructive heat now, onlythe brilliant light. So she altered her spell, removed the energy of heat, andfocused on creating wizard’s light instead of wizard’s fire.The bonfire flared as if a sun had suddenly appeared at the bottom of theamphitheater, a blinding silent explosion that made Nicci shield her blue eyes.From above, she heard a collective gasp, and the Hidden People backed fartheraway from the rim, unable to tolerate such an outpouring of artificial light.Shielding her eyes with her palm, Nicci managed to look at the blazing orb shehad created. It engulfed the speaking stage and surged like a scream ofbrilliance enhanced a thousandfold by the mirrors, crystals, and polishedprecious metals. Even from their lair, the zhiss had to see it and be drawnacross the night like moths to a flame.Continuing to release her gift, she kept the beacon shining bright and listenedfor the deadly buzz, but heard no sounds except the crackle of the central fire.The wizard’s light pulsed with a hypnotic thrum, and the city held its breath.As more minutes passed with no sign of the throbbing cloud, Nicci waited, tense,feeling a shred of doubt. What if the zhiss really did go dormant at night? Whatif they retreated to sealed lairs, like bats hanging in caves, where theycouldn’t see her beacon? What could flush them out?Using both the Additive and Subtractive sides of her gift, just as when she hadtried to summon the sliph, she sent out her thoughts to draw the zhiss. Light!Come feed on the light! Come feed on the blood!Finally, a different sort of hum penetrated the air, a thrumming that increasedto a grating buzz. She looked up, away from the dazzling beacon, and saw afeatureless black swirl blotting out the starlight. The zhiss swarm broke apartand spread over Orogang, called by the irresistible glare. She raised hercloth-wrapped arms to beckon them. She pulled the cloth away from her face sothey could smell her blood.The Hidden People fled back to their sheltered doorways, but the movementattracted the zhiss. One arm of the dark cloud extended toward the gray-cloakedpeople.With her wizard’s light still flaring, Nicci moved up the arena steps to streetlevel, intent on distracting the swarm. The mindless, bloodthirsty flecks hadalready swooped down upon two lagging people, who collapsed, covered withfeeding zhiss. Nicci couldn’t reach them in time to save them, but theirunwitting sacrifice would kill many of the swarming creatures. As the zhissgorged themselves on the tainted blood, clouds of swollen globules lumberedaway, sated with poisoned blood. As before, the fat spheres turned a sicklypurple and burst to spatter across the flagstones.The rest of the zhiss cloud, though, hurtled toward the bright light like aswarm of ten thousand bees. Nicci stood on the rim of the amphitheater. “Here!Over here.” She waved her hands, hoping that her unpoisoned and gifted bloodwould be more desirable than the blood of other victims. “Over here, by thelight!” She tore the scarves away from her face and head, shook her hair free.“Here! To me!”The black cloud swirled like a pall of greasy smoke, while the nexus of lightcontinued to crackle and shine at the bottom of the amphitheater. The zhiss werehungry, looking for prey, and she needed to lure them to the cauldron trap. Theravenous black swarm probed doorways and windows, trying to find cracks in themasterfully laid stones.When the zhiss sensed her, Nicci felt her skin tingle. At last the smell of heruntainted blood drew them, and the black cloud surged all around her, swoopingin even faster than she had expected. As if she were engulfed in thick smoke,the zhiss blanketed her body. It was like a surprising hailstorm of black ice,shapeless nuggets that moved and pulsed and bit, each one no larger than thenail on her little finger. They tried to penetrate the fabric, and they foundfolds, created small rips, worked their way to her skin. Each small thing wascovered with pointed needlelike legs that jabbed into her skin, one zhiss on topof another, blanketing her arms, her face, her neck, nesting in her hair,covering her eyelids.Suffocating, Nicci used her gift to summon a pulse of wind that blasted themaway, but it was like coughing out a breath against pollen in the air. The zhisscame back with a vengeance. She staggered to the steep steps, trying to drawthem down into the sunken amphitheater, the tantalizing fire. After feeding,hundreds of them rose from her body, swollen globules filled with dark redfluid—her blood, gifted blood. She knew that once they had drained her, theswarm would reproduce explosively. She had to stop them!Determination gave her strength, and she pushed harder with her magic. This washer blood, her blood! She called on a thread of Subtractive Magic to burst everyone of the rising globules, destroying dozens at a time.But her body was encrusted with the black things, and they kept drinking herblood. Using her deadly magic, Nicci tried to stop their hearts, but the zhisshad no hearts. They were just tiny ravenous membranes.Weakened from sudden loss of blood, she dropped to her knees on the amphitheatersteps and fought to hold on to her strength. If nothing else, she would crawldown into the crater to contain them, even if she trapped herself as well. Sheneeded to retain enough of her gift to form the shield, or the zhiss wouldescape. And for that, she had to be alive!Outside, a woman’s voice was loud enough to penetrate the buzzing clamor. “Here,take me! Feed on me, and follow me to the light!”It was Cora! The old woman ran from the palace archway, throwing aside her graycloak to expose leathery wrinkled skin.Seeing another victim, the zhiss did not need to be encouraged. Part of theswarm around Nicci shifted course, and countless thousands of the black specksrushed in to engulf Cora. The old woman kept running even as the black thingscovered her skin, plastered her face. She slowed, then staggered until shebarely plodded forward, each step taking her closer to the sunken amphitheater.Countless zhiss drifted up after sucking her tainted blood and burst in the air,but thousands more swarmed around the old woman.With her last energy, Cora reached the edge of the amphitheater and collapsed onthe sloping ramp. Her body rolled down the tiers of seats as the zhiss closedin, dead before she slid to a stop at the third tier. Zhiss blanketed hermotionless body, but now they were also drawn to the blazing beacon at thecentral stage.Nicci pawed at her face to tear away the feeding creatures, felt the countlessstinging bite marks on her skin, the loss of blood. Knowing this was her lastchance, she called up a powerful wave of her gift. She heated her skin, hardenedit, sent rippling bursts of force that scraped the bloodsucking specks away, andthen with a heavy wind she herded the entire cloud toward the shining wizard’sfire, the waves of reflected light from hundreds of polished surfaces. The glowwas irresistible.She withdrew her magic from the blazing beacon, which made the light retract,like a setting sun. In the dark and empty city, the zhiss were drawn toward thelight, following it like moths spiraling into their doom around a single flame.Though drained from expending her gift and weak from blood loss, Nicci rose toher feet again and climbed down to the bottom of the crater and the blazingstage. The zhiss cloud closed in, nearly eclipsing the shrinking globe ofwizard’s light. When the complete swarm was within the bowl of the amphitheater,she called up another wave of magic to establish a shield, a curved shimmeringbarrier like a bubble over the stage.The zhiss were bottled up, but only for as long as she could hold the shield inplace.“Hurry!” Her voice was just a croak. She hoped the Hidden People could hear her.“I need you. Builders—now! You are ready for this.” A flood of gray-robed peoplerushed out from the sealed buildings.Though her thoughts were dizzy, she shrank the shield, retracted the bubble topush the bottled zhiss farther and farther down toward the central fire, tocontain them in a controllable space. The rim of the hemispherical shielddropped to the middle levels of seats, then kept shrinking, pushing the blackswarm into a smaller and smaller confinement.Inside the palace, Mrra finally smashed through the last shreds of the woodendoor and escaped, bounding out of the building and into the streets to help herblood-spattered sister panther. Nicci fell to her knees and felt theblood-soaked fabric of her black dress. Mrra pressed against her, offeringstrength and protection, but Nicci could not let her concentration falter.The bubble was now small enough that it was only a dome over the stage at thebottom of the amphitheater, a sealed prison with the waning bonfire and thebuzzing zhiss. To maintain her strength, Nicci withdrew her energy that kept thewizard’s light glowing, and the fire died out, leaving the sealed bubble indarkness and all the frustrated zhiss trapped with no light and no blood. Theybattered against the invisible curved wall like thousands of vengeful hornets.“Now!” she gasped. “Contain them!”Architects, carpenters, stonemasons raced out, along with all the labor forcethey could need. They had drawn their plans, laid down their supplies, gatheredtheir tools, and they were prepared. Working like agitated bees, the builders ofOrogang threw long crossbars over the lower part of the amphitheater. They hadalready sealed the floor of the stage, caulked and bricked even the tiniest ofopenings. Next, they crisscrossed the beams and added a structural layer ofwooden slats, which they covered with opaque tarpaulins, sealing the dome. Moreteams slathered the thick fabric with fast-hardening plaster. On top of that,they laid layers of bricks, building up an impenetrable cap to cover theimprisoned zhiss.All the while, Nicci focused her effort into maintaining the shield that trappedthe black cloud, holding them until the permanent containment could be finished.The Hidden People moved in a coordinated flurry. They reinforced their solidbarrier, covering any open gaps, then slathered the bricks with more thickplaster and mortar, layer upon layer, to a thickness of many feet andimpenetrably black.Before dawn, hundreds of workers had entirely sealed the zhiss in a prison thatwould hold them forever. No light, no blood, no freedom. They would wither awayand die.Nicci groggily realized that Asha was shaking her shoulders. “It is finished.You can rest now.”The sorceress couldn’t even lift her head, but she slumped against the bigpanther who purred beside her. With a sigh of relief, Nicci released her hold onthe gift, letting the inner shield fade. The zhiss were forever sealed withinthe impossibly thick and opaque walls of their enclosure. The solid barrierheld, but the Hidden People would keep reinforcing it, thickening it for days.Nicci didn’t know how long it would take for the zhiss to starve, to dwindleaway to nothing, but she was certain they would never get out.She didn’t have the strength to struggle as the Hidden People picked her up andcarried her back into the shelter. She could rest with confidence now. As hereyes closed, she felt the weakness of blood loss and the utter weariness fromexpending so much of her gift. But she would recover.She had done what she’d promised. Now all she had to worry about was preventingGeneral Utros from conquering the world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 [part0003.html#a7]The smoke from moss-covered firewood had a sour smell, but the odor of decayingflesh bothered Lila more. She cautiously hunkered down across from Adessa. Theolder morazeth had an unsettling gleam in her eyes as she sat by her campfire.Lila explained, “I am pursuing the Norukai serpent ships down the river, lookingfor my chance. I need your help.”Adessa was puzzled. Her voice sounded distant and strange. “Why do you careabout Norukai?”“Much has changed since you left on the night of the revolt.” Lila frowned.“Nothing is left of Ildakar. The army of General Utros awakened and laid siegeto the city, and then a Norukai fleet attacked us from the river. Ildakarvanished under the shroud of eternity again, and I was trapped outside. We can’tgo back. No one can.”Adessa turned her gaze to look at the severed head resting on the mattedgrasses. She glowered at it. “That’s what he just told me.”Black bugs scuttled over the pus-filled flesh. The head was hideously decayed,the eyes swollen shut, the mouth sagging. It took Lila a moment to recognize thedark hair, the goatee, the distorted features. “That is Wizard Commander Maxim.”“Sovrena Thora commanded me to bring back his head, and I am doing so.” Adessaunconsciously swatted away a biting insect. “He was Mirrormask and he wanted tobring down Ildakar. He has paid for his crimes, but not enough.” Her expressiondarkened, and she suddenly yelled at the decomposing horror. “You hear me,Maxim? Not enough! I will place your head on a spike before the gates ofIldakar, where the entire population can know what you did.”Lila found her comments and mannerisms tinged with madness. In a calm, evenvoice, she explained again. “Ildakar is gone, Adessa. We can’t go back.”The other morazeth cocked her head and seemed to hear a response from therotting lump. Adessa sat up straight as if preparing to fight. Though her hardyears were showing, she had once been beautiful in a feral way, herclose-cropped dark hair shot with lines of silver. Her face was lean, her bodymuscular, but now Adessa’s dark eyes held a haunted shadow. Her gaze flickedback and forth, as if she was watching things unseen. “No, no. He was lying!Ildakar can’t be gone. I still have to bring Maxim’s head back to the sovrena.”Sitting near the fire, Lila laced her fingers together around one bare knee. “Iam your morazeth sister. You know I would not lie to you.”Adessa sagged, then glared at the severed head. “Yes, Lila, I know you speak thetruth.” She grabbed the clumps of dark hair, then carried the head to thecampfire. “Shall I roast you here? If the sovrena is gone, then I don’t need todeliver the trophy anymore. I’d like to hear you scream as the fire cooks theremaining skin off your face.”Decaying drops of fluid oozed down the chin to drip in sizzling bursts in thecoals. Lila kept her voice low and guarded. “What are you doing, Adessa?”“Making him stop his taunts!”The wizard commander’s sunken eyes were pools of gray jelly, like rotten eggwhites. With a wet sound, part of his scalp ripped from the skull, and the loosehead dropped toward the fire, but Adessa rescued it by grabbing the soft neckstump. “Not yet. Not so easy for you.”Adessa returned the wizard commander’s head to the stained sack. “Be silent!”Then she turned back to Lila. “If what you say is true, if the sovrena isdefeated and Ildakar is gone, then my quest is ended.” The disappointment on herface struck Lila’s heart. The quest, the woman’s reason for suffering so manyhardships, was all that had kept her going. “Now where do I go? What do I do?”“I have a mission of my own,” Lila said, “and it is a morazeth mission. Youcould help me. There are many Norukai to fight and kill, and it will give you achance to spill more blood. That would give us both a purpose.”“Tell me about your mission.”Lila delivered a formal report to her commander, hoping to get through toAdessa. She talked at length about Bannon, the young swordsman she had trainedin the combat pits.Adessa raised her eyebrows. “Yes, Bannon was your special pet. He corrupted mychampion Ian and forced me to kill him. If you are hunting Bannon now, I willhelp you. He should die for the damage he did to our society. For making mewaste a good champion like Ian.”Lila considered how to answer that question. “Yes, I am hunting him, but not toharm him. Bannon and I fought alongside each other to defend Ildakar, and weeven battled King Grieve himself.” Her voice dropped. “He was taken captivealong with many Ildakarans. With the city gone and me trapped outside, I took onmy own mission. I have to rescue Bannon.”“Why?”Lila felt a flare of defensive anger. “Because I choose to do so! I consider themission worthwhile, and if you are my morazeth sister, then you will accept thatreasoning.”Adessa pondered. The mossy fire was burning low, and Lila added some green twigsto it. The darkness around them remained deep, but a low mist had risen from themarshes. Adessa nodded distantly. “Sovrena Thora disliked the Norukai, calledthem brutes. She would have wanted me to kill them because they attacked thecity, but why would I do it to save a skinny arena slave? Bannon caused a greatdeal of trouble. Is he that remarkable a lover?”Lila had already thought of the answer. “Now that the shroud of eternity isback, Bannon Farmer is the only warrior who remains. In a sense, he is thechampion of Ildakar, and he could be useful.”Adessa considered that. “One should not discard useful tools or fighters.”“Then let us plan a trap together. We will fight the Norukai, and I can freeBannon, as I vowed to do.” The intensity of her gaze caught Adessa’s attention.“Will you help me, morazeth to morazeth?”Adessa snapped at the unseen head inside the sack. “I don’t care what you wish,Maxim! I make my own decision.” The flecks of madness in her eyes grew brighter.“Stop laughing, or I’ll submerge your head again and let the fish eat more ofyour face.”Composing herself, Adessa faced Lila across the campfire. “If you and I are theonly two morazeth that remain outside the shroud of eternity, then your missionis mine. I will battle the Norukai with you, but you can save the scrawnyswordsman on your own.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 [part0003.html#a7]A thousand soldiers carrying flame-symbol banners pressed toward Orogang. Asthey gained altitude and the terrain grew more rugged, General Utros recognizedthe dark crags with patches of snow on their summits. He inhaled the thin, chillair, a refreshing change from the dust of the road, the thick odor of horses,and countless sweating men.“Will we see the capital today, beloved Utros?” asked Ruva, riding beside him.He lifted his head high, a victorious military commander coming back to reporton the lands he had conquered. They were close to the city; he could taste it.“Yes, it will be today.”That dawn, while his soldiers broke camp and prepared for another long march,Utros had polished his gold half mask. He studied the burnished metal, theidealized sculpture of his features. When he entered the imperial palace, hewondered if anyone would remember the face of Utros after all these centuries.History recorded large-scale events and political consequences, but rarelypreserved the details of a man’s physical appearance. Would anyone know him atall?“They will remember your legend,” Ruva said. “History is filled with stories ofGeneral Utros. That is what the wizard Nathan said.”He gazed along the widening road shadowed by tall mountains. “We shall see forourselves. I’ll face the man who now sits on the throne in Orogang, and I willdetermine if he is worthy.”He dispatched a pair of scouts to ride ahead to announce their arrival. Heselected two men who were originally from Orogang, fighters who had left theirhomes and loved ones to follow General Utros, long ago. The two scouts proudlyshouldered their responsibility.“We will bring you news, sir,” said a man with an unfortunately large nose. “Andwe’ll make sure the people of Orogang prepare a welcome celebration for yourreturning army.”“We’re going home!” the other scout cried with such enthusiasm that his voicecracked like the voice of a boy struggling with puberty. They galloped off.Utros kept silent as he rode forward, leading his escort army. The twinsorceresses looked eagerly ahead, their bright eyes searching for the grandeurthat Utros had promised them ages ago. He was perplexed and disappointed by thesad state of the main roads. This close to the great city, he expected to seeoverburdened caravans, farmers with wagons, travelers, military patrols. WithOrogang’s population of nearly a million people, even the outlying areas shouldhave seen much activity.Dark pines rose all around, and he knew the forests should have been cut forfirewood and construction material. The rocky slopes should have shown thestair-stepped gashes of stone quarries. Why were there no fields of grain, noorchards, no grazing sheep or cattle? Where were the people?They passed only the foundation stones and crumbling walls of long-collapsedcottages. The twins picked up on his uneasy mood. Ava and Ruva kept glancing athim, wondering how they could help. The mounted army began to display an oddmixture of impatience, joy, and concern.By noon the pair of scouts galloped back to the general, and he could alreadyread the grim news on their faces. The large-nosed man had tear tracks throughthe dust on his cheeks. Both scouts lowered their voices. “We found Orogang,sir. The city . . .”“The whole city is empty and abandoned!” blurted the other scout. “Thepopulation is gone, the streets are empty.”“Was the city ransacked?” Utros demanded, trying to keep his dismay in check.“Conquered?”“I don’t know.” The scout with the big nose had lost his sincere smile. “Thebuildings don’t look burned or destroyed, just abandoned. The structures areintact, but they’re sealed up.”“I will see this myself.” Utros urged his horse forward.The scouts turned their mounts about and led the way. “It’s less than half anhour’s ride, sir. Follow us.”Utros grasped the reins and kicked the stallion into a gallop. Ava and Ruvaraced alongside their general. Behind them, the army let out a cheer and urgedtheir horses faster, rushing toward Orogang like a battlefield charge.When they reached the outskirts of the city, Utros suddenly had troublebreathing. Silence loomed like a pestilence in the air. The towering structureswere washed by the sun like bleached bones in a desert. Silent and dead.Utros trembled as he guided his stallion between imposing monoliths, stone pilesthat had once formed an awe-inspiring gate. The streets that should havecelebrated the glory of the empire were overgrown, the flagstones buckled.Twisted trees reached up from wherever seeds had found cracks or crannies.His army crowded behind their general as Utros halted to stare at the vacantgate. Ava and Ruva were silent, dismayed for the general’s sake. “It’s gone,” hesaid. “My empire is gone. Who leads it now?”“He would only be an emperor of dust,” said Ruva.Ava said, “The slate has been wiped clean, beloved Utros. This is Orogang. Itcould be your own capital, and you will rebuild the empire.”Ruva agreed, “Your empire.”He could not let the men see his crippling disappointment. Still picturinghimself as a conquering hero, he proudly rode his stallion through the remainsof the grand arch. Behind him, his army flowed into the empty capital.As he looked around, he remembered the palace, the observatory pyramid, the talllookout towers. Utros recognized the ministry building with its line of flutedcolumns and multiple entrances, all of which were now barricaded shut. Thepalace had sported myriad multicolored windows, but now he saw only a wall ofmortared bricks.“Someone turned my city into a tomb.” He had expected bustling streets, crowdedbazaars, craftsmen districts, moneylenders, temples, stonecutters. Now therewere only ominous silence and shadows, even in the bright afternoon.As his army moved through the streets, other scouts came back with good news.“We found storehouses, General! Many sacks of grain, barrels of apples,potatoes, even kegs of wine and ale. Those supplies will help our people.”“Seize everything,” Utros said, pleased. Ava and Ruva had worked their spell sothe soldiers could not feel the gnawing hunger, but now, thankfully, they hadreal supplies, enough for a well-deserved feast.The clatter of iron-shod horse hooves echoed against the stone walls, but thesound was no substitute for massed crowds and loud cheers. In the central plaza,Utros pulled his stallion to a halt and dismounted. He stood before a colossalstatue that had toppled from its base. The massive stone arms were broken, thebooted feet still secured to the marble pedestal. The figure sprawled on theground in several pieces, weathered with age. He looked down at the carved headand recognized the sneering self-important expression as well as the distinctiveiron fang. Kurgan’s statue had been brought down when his own people overthrewhim.“General!” one of the scouts shouted from the other side of the square. “Youmust see this.”The sorceresses slid from their saddles and stood next to him on the ground,ready to fight. He could sense a crackle in the air as they summoned their giftto defend him. The ominous tension around the city put them all on edge.With a brisk stride, Utros went to an adjacent plaza, where he saw a secondgreat statue, this one even taller than Kurgan’s and well maintained, the stonepolished. Fresh flowers were strewn around the base. His gaze was drawn upwardto look at the stone face, the full beard, the strong jaw, the features that soclosely matched the shape of his gold half mask. The base of the statue markedout his name in chiseled letters. utros.More soldiers filled the open areas, a full army conquering an empty city.Questions rustled among them like breezes in a brewing storm. Utros had noanswers for them, but they could draw their own conclusions. The weight ofmysteries was oppressive.The gigantic statue proved that Utros was indeed remembered, that his legend hadsurvived, but he also sensed that the city wasn’t as empty as he had firstthought. Silent threats lurked there. Hidden eyes watched them from shadowedrecesses in buildings, no doubt plotting something. All the men were tense,their guard raised.Ava and Ruva also looked uneasy. His soldiers drew their weapons, waiting forsomething to happen. The tableau seemed ready to explode.*General Utros had returned! Cyrus knew it the moment he saw the military leaderastride his black horse, wearing armor much as was depicted in the toweringstatue.Nicci had told the Hidden People that Utros still lived, and although Cyrus andhis followers had prayed for that all their lives, he had merely hoped to find aworthy successor to Utros, not the legendary general himself, in the flesh. Butthat was what the prophecy had said. It was true! Now the great commander rodeinto the city with a thousand well-disciplined soldiers, returning to Orogangjust as Cyrus had hoped.The general wore an imposing helmet adorned with the curved horns of somemassive beast, and half his face was covered with a burnished gold mask thatmade him look less human, but more terrifying. Two beautiful hairless women rodeon either side of him, and Cyrus remembered legends of the fearsome twinsorceresses that accompanied General Utros.Huddled in their shadows, the Hidden People were exhausted and battered afterhelping Nicci contain the zhiss the night before. Many of them were weak fromloss of blood, but they had survived the ordeal. Nicci was unconscious,recovering deep inside the palace.Because of her efforts to save the Hidden People, Cyrus had begun to forgiveher. She had indeed imprisoned the bloodthirsty black cloud, freeing them fromtheir oppressive obligations. But she had also declared that the legendary Utroswas an untrustworthy tyrant who meant only to conquer the Old World. Cyrusdidn’t believe Nicci. She lied, and her lies uprooted all the beliefs that heand his followers held so dear.And now Utros had returned!Cyrus looked through the open windows—open windows, even in the daylight! Hewatched the armored soldiers ride into the great plaza, saw the magnificentuniforms, banners with the flame symbol of the once-great empire. Oh, this was aglorious day in many ways!“Hurry!” Cyrus called his followers. “Take your swords and whatever armor westill have. To arms! We must show General Utros that we still remember, that weare worthy of him. Hurry!”Twenty of his followers seized weapons from the stockpiles, battered helmets,ragtag breastplates and capes, anything that would make them look impressive.They were pale from living in the shadows, and many had scabs and blood blistersfrom the attack of the zhiss. Cyrus knew they must look horrific, but they couldnot wait. Utros was here! There would never be a better chance. He had lived allhis days for this moment.Cyrus rallied his people. “Our general has returned at last. Run out to meethim!” He grabbed his own sword, raised it, and ran out at the forefront.With a triumphant roar, unable to contain their exuberance at seeing the legendproved true at last, Cyrus and his followers surged out into the square.*A door creaked open in a council building and pale figures appeared. They woresinister, hooded gray robes, and all of them carried gleaming swords, scraps ofarmor obviously scavenged from elsewhere. “It is Utros!” one of the strangerscalled.Figures rushed out of the building with furtive spiderlike movements like asmall, shouting army. They scuttled quickly, swirling their cloaks around them.Nearly a hundred of them ran forward, raising their swords. “General Utros!”As soon as the first man charged into the dazzling sunlight, though, hestaggered and shielded his eyes, swinging his blade in the air. The bright sunblinded them. The threatening army behind the first man also covered their faceswith their hands and cringed from the light, but they blundered forward, all ofthem armed.Ava and Ruva reacted without waiting for orders from Utros. Seeing the danger tothe general, they launched a burst of fire that engulfed the leading group ofpale, threatening figures. Even as the flames incinerated the front ranks, thetwin sorceresses followed with a bolt of lightning that blasted more of theintimidating figures.Ava sounded satisfied as the ominous people collapsed. “We will protect you,beloved Utros.”Utros frowned at the blackened skeletons. “I wanted to know who they were. Whydid they attack me?”From inside the ominous buildings, they heard more threatening movement,multiple doors opening. Faces pressed against hidden peepholes, and mutteringvoices rose with an undertone of anger."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 [part0003.html#a7]When Nathan’s party reached the high pass of Kol Adair, he felt a sense ofpurpose, if not triumph. With Nicci and Bannon, he had originally climbed therugged mountains above the lands of the Scar, intent on reaching this singularpass.Prelate Verna had ridden beside him up the last rocky switchbacks until theglorious top of the pass unfolded before them. Nathan breathed hard in the thinair, but he couldn’t seem to fill his lungs.General Zimmer and his soldiers gathered on the open tundra. A large rock cairnmarked the high point of the pass like a monument to fallen kings. By now, theywere quite far ahead of the enormous marching army. Zimmer called out, “We resthere for an hour. Eat your food, drink your water. There will be plenty ofstreams on the other side. We need to keep moving toward Cliffwall.”Amber and Peretta mingled with the Sisters of the Light, while Oliver shaded hiseyes and squinted into the distance, as if amazed at how far he had come.Rendell hunched his head, the expansive panorama seemingly too much for him toendure.Captain Trevor said sadly, “The first time we reached this point, Renn droppedto his knees and kissed the stones, but on our way back I don’t think he pausedto admire the view, he was so anxious to get home to Ildakar.” Trevor heaved asigh. “Now he will never go home.”The two morazeth showed no discomfort from the brisk wind. They studied thesteep route down the other side of the pass. “It looks like a rugged journeyahead,” Lyesse said.Nathan looked down the western slope to where he could see broken glaciers thathad tumbled down in a recent avalanche. “It will be a far more difficult routefor that giant army. In many places, the soldiers will have to move single file.We’ll pull even farther ahead.”He claimed a boulder for his seat and removed the life book from its pouch. Withnumb fingertips, he traced the leather cover. The book contained a chronicle ofhistory and adventure, everything he had done since leaving the Dark Lands farto the north. He had filled many of the pages, and he could hardly believe allhe had done and faced.Verna sat next to him on the large rock. “You’ve been here before, Nathan. Whatdrew you to Kol Adair in the first place? Did you know what was on the otherside? Were you looking for Ildakar?”“Kol Adair was where I hoped to regain my gift,” he said. “But it was just astep in a longer journey.” Now that he had discarded his stained wizard’s robein favor of more familiar black pants and ruffled shirt, he rested his hand onthe ornate hilt of the sword. Nathan stroked his smooth chin. “It was aprophecy, of sorts.”“A prophecy?” Verna was surprised. “You of all people know how misleading anyprophecy can be, even back when prophecy still worked. All the forked paths,true ones and false ones.”“Indeed, my dear prelate. That is why the Sisters of the Light locked me up fora thousand years.” He raised his eyebrows. “And look what good that did you! Itonly led to the ruin of the Palace of the Prophets and caused great dismay toyour entire order.” He sniffed. “Serves you right. You should know what happensto anyone who attempts to thwart prophecy.”“Yet you came here yourself following a prophecy. Weren’t you aware of thedanger?”“A desperate man will grasp at any hope, and a desperate wizard has ways tobelieve what he wishes to believe. Besides, my dear, I wasn’t attempting tothwart prophecy, but to follow it.”He opened the life book, flipped back through the pages, ignoring his neathandwriting. On the very first page he read lines in a different hand. “This iswhat the witch woman wrote. We didn’t know what it meant at the time.” He ranhis fingers along the words as he read them aloud. “ ‘Future and Fate depend onboth the journey and the destination. Kol Adair lies far to the south in the OldWorld. From there, the Wizard will behold what he needs to make himself wholeagain. And the Sorceress must save the world.’ ”He paused. “My gift had abandoned me aboard the Wavewalker, you see. I couldn’tperform even the simplest magic, not so much as a spark of flame in the palm ofmy hand. Red had written those lines while my gift was at full strength, yet sheknew somehow I would lose it.”“If you’re interpreting the words correctly,” Verna said. “You, Prophet, knowthat a reader reads the details of a premonition according to his own wishes.”“I did know that, but I didn’t remember it. I was convinced that once I reachedKol Adair, my gift would suddenly return, that I would achieve the end of myquest. But no, the words say only that I would behold what I needed.” He lookedeastward beyond the pass. “And from here, through a trick of a mirage, we sawIldakar, far away, shimmering as the shroud of eternity flickered. That is whywe headed there, and eventually I did indeed get what I needed, the heart of awizard.”Nathan suddenly winced as pain shot through his chest. Ivan’s heart beat harder,pounding as if trying to break free of his rib cage, fighting back against itsnew owner.Verna saw his grimace. “What is wrong? I’ve seen you rub your chest before. Doesyour heart still bother you?”“The heart is not entirely mine.” He gave her a wan grin. “At least that is whatChief Handler Ivan seems to think.”Loosening the laces among the ruffles of his shirt, he tugged open the front toreveal the long white scar on his breastbone. “This was where Fleshmancer Andretore out my heart and replaced it with Ivan’s to give me my gift back. Andrewasn’t sure the scheme would work, and I’m quite certain that Ivan had no wishto participate.” He tugged the laces tight against the chill breezes on thepass. “It wasn’t my choice either, but I had tried everything else. A prophetwithout prophecy and a wizard without the gift—I felt quite useless, Verna.” Hewondered whether he had ever used her first name before. “At the time, Iaccepted what I had to do, and now there is no reason to second-guess it. I dohave my gift back, and I will fight against the enemies of the land. That is allI can do.”Verna placed a comforting hand on his knee. “And what does the rest of theprophecy mean? ‘And the Sorceress must save the world.’ ”“That part is for Nicci, I believe, but she’s been doing that all along.”After a brief rest, the company moved on down the western slope. The lead horsespicked their way in single file along the rougher and more jumbled terrain. Inmany places the road had been damaged, strewn with fallen boulders or swept awayby sheets of ice and snow.Holding on to the saddle horn, Zimmer rocked back and forth as his horsetraversed the uneven ground. He glanced back over his shoulder. “Our avalanchecertainly caused a lot of damage, Prelate.”Nathan raised his eyebrows. “Your avalanche?”“You’ll see soon enough,” Verna said as the first line of horses picked theirway across an angled white field.Dislodged pebbles and ice chunks still pattered down the slopes. Though Nathanfelt uneasy about the unstable terrain, he could only imagine how difficult thispassage would be for many thousands of marching men in full armor. By the timethey reached Cliffwall, their small group should be a week or more ahead of themain army.As the party veered around the broad fan of a fresh jumbled snowfield, Nathanrealized the white blocks were studded with dark forms, a glint of polishedarmor, the sharp edge of a shield. A gauntleted hand reached out of the frozenmass. As the company approached, cawing ravens took wing from their feast offrozen meat.“Those are bodies!” Nathan realized just how many corpses there were; not justhundreds, but thousands. “Dear spirits!”“One of General Utros’s expeditionary armies,” Verna said. “We found them campedjust below Kol Adair, beneath the heavy glaciers.”Zimmer pulled up to a halt beside them. “We estimated they were ten thousand menmarching in the general direction of Cliffwall. We stopped them.”Amber, Peretta, and Oliver called out as they stopped by the edge of theavalanche field. “Some of the ice melted, but the bodies are still frozen!”“Not so frozen that the crows can’t eat them,” Peretta said. “By summer, allthese bones will be picked clean.”Nathan tried to grasp what he was seeing. “What did you do? How did you causethis?”Verna seemed quite pleased with herself. “Renn was the only wizard among us, butthere were Sisters of the Light and many gifted Cliffwall scholars. Together, weused magic to melt the ice in strategic places, which lubricated the glaciersheets. Gravity did the rest.” She shrugged as if it had been a simple exercise.At the edge of the ice field, Nathan stared at the innumerable buried bodies,the armor, helmets, and the exposed faces with pecked skin.The morazeth nodded with admiration. “Ten thousand?” Thorn asked.“An impressive score,” Lyesse added.Nathan turned to the prim prelate, seeing Verna in an entirely different light.“I had no idea you were so bloodthirsty, my dear.”“I can be, when it’s necessary.”“Yes, I suppose you can. I have seen you do many hard things over the years.”Nathan and the prelate had an often contentious relationship. She considered himdangerous due to his gift of prophecy, and after he’d escaped from the Palace ofthe Prophets, she had tried to hunt him down. Nathan had only wanted hisfreedom, living his life for the first time, even though he was already athousand years old. He had indeed found adventure and love, more than once.He sighed. “After Clarissa was killed, I was so angry at you that I broke yourjaw.”Verna hung her head. “I am sorry about that.”“You’re sorry? I’m the one who smashed you in the face.”“Many things were different then. It healed.”Nathan thought of beautiful, innocent Clarissa, and then Prelate Ann, whom hehad also loved . . . and much more recently there was Elsa, who had sacrificedherself in a blaze of glory with her transference magic. “Not everything healscompletely.”He kicked at the armored glove of a body that was buried in ice and snow.Without gloating further over the massacre, he and his companions moved ontoward Cliffwall."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31 [part0003.html#a7]Yes, she would take the head of the Norukai king. That would be her new trophy,her new quest, and Adessa considered it a worthy one.She felt alive again with a purpose, a true morazeth purpose. The sack with thewizard commander’s head bumped against her hip as she sprinted along the riverwith Lila beside her.The severed head had fallen silent, and Adessa was glad not to listen to histaunts, not to look at his rotting face. Maybe the Keeper had silenced him forgood. What worried Adessa, though, was that Lila didn’t seem to hear the wizardcommander at all.When the young woman explained what had happened to Ildakar, Adessa felt thesolid ground of her life drop out beneath her. She had asked herself repeatedlywhether killing Maxim was enough of a purpose, in and of itself. And now that hewas dead, what did she have left, other than carrying the head back to Ildakar?A city that no longer existed.Even that had been taken from her. The emptiness was a void filled only withMaxim’s mocking laughter, but now Lila had given her a new mission. Bannon meantnothing to her, but Adessa did care for her morazeth sister. Therefore, Lila’squest was her own quest. Besides, she liked the idea of killing King Grieve.The two women could run for hours with only brief rests. Lila had insisted onthe need for speed, because although the Norukai would stop to anchor atintermittent times, the serpent ships moved swiftly along the Killraven. Inorder for their plan to succeed, they had to get ahead of the three vessels sothey could lay their trap.The game trail turned into a footpath, then an actual road as they reached theoutskirts of a tiny fishing town. The two women gave it a wide berth, becauseencountering people would only delay them. But when they stumbled upon a huntertrudging back to his home with a small gutted deer over his shoulders, the manwas so startled to see the morazeth running toward him that he dropped his killand grabbed his bow. The two barely paused as they raced past him.Lila called over her shoulder, “Warn your village! Norukai ships are coming, andthey will kill your people, burn your homes. Get everyone to safety.”The man gaped at them, but they had already vanished into the forest. Adessapointed out, “This means we must be ahead of the raiders. Otherwise that villagewould have been destroyed already.”Lila pushed on with greater speed. “We have a chance to set up an ambush, if wefind the right place to do it.”By late afternoon they came upon an elbow of dry land that jutted into theriver. Lila paused and looked around with a critical eye. She smiled. “We canbuild a bonfire here where the Norukai ships are sure to see it. We will tauntthem and bring them closer.”“I will challenge them.” Adessa responded with a predatory grin. “If he is not acoward, King Grieve will face me.”As sunset approached, knowing the raider ships were coming, though they wouldanchor when night set in, the two morazeth moved through the underbrush breakingoff dead branches and hauling dry marsh grasses, which they piled out on thespit of land to prepare a big fire.Adessa found a fallen tree with a hollow interior that would make an adequatedrum. Together, they dragged the hollow log to the edge of the water, whereAdessa could sit in front of the bonfire and make loud, rhythmic pounding. Oneway or another, she would command the attention of the Norukai.The two women waited as darkness fell and the river sounds grew louder, moresinister. Adessa stared out at the empty river, penetrating the gloom with hereyes, listening intently. She smiled at her companion. “Can you hear it?”Gruff voices carried on the water, along with the creak of wood.Lila tucked her dagger into its sheath, checked the small agile knife at herside and Sturdy strapped to her back. “I will get ready. Give me the diversion Ineed, and I’ll save Bannon. That is our mission.”Adessa responded with a wolfish grin, then a glance at the sack. “We will keeptheir attention, don’t worry.”Lila sprinted off along the riverbank to take her position in the bushes, whileAdessa ignited the bonfire. The flames quickly caught the reeds and grasses,burning fast and hot. The signal blaze rose high, demanding the attention of theserpent ships.As she moved to the hollow log, a muffled voice came from the sack at her side.“The Keeper wants you.”“The Keeper will have all of us in our time. I wish he would take you now.”“Poor Adessa . . .” Maxim said in an oily mocking voice.“Silence!” Adessa’s shout echoed across the river, and she heard surprisedresponses from the Norukai vessels.She sat cross-legged next to the hollow log and hammered on the trunk with awooden branch, pounding out a loud drumbeat. When Maxim’s head continued to mockher, she just beat the stick louder, drowning him out.When the fearsome serpent ships came closer, attracted by the blazing fire andthe pounding beat, Adessa stood and went to the river’s edge. Her silhouettewould stand out clearly against the bright flames. From the ships she heardtaunting jeers, burly raiders pointing at her as if she were a fool.She shouted loudly enough to be heard over their catcalls. “I am a morazeth fromIldakar, and I challenge King Grieve to a fight. I mean to kill someonetonight.”Cloaked in the last light of dusk, the serpent ships approached closer in themain river channel. Raucous shouts came back over the water in response to herchallenge.Adessa stood her ground, calling back to them. “Is Grieve a coward to face mehimself? Very well, let him send a lesser Norukai, or two, if you think that iswhat you need to fight a morazeth.”A smaller boat dropped into the water from the lead ship. Two barrel-chestedNorukai, their faces slashed into permanent hideous grimaces, rowed to where shewaited on the spit of land by the bonfire. Each man carried ominous weapons,which Adessa ignored. She had her short sword, her dagger, and her agile knife,which was little more than a rune-marked handle that no Norukai would recognize.She also carried the bloodstained sack with the head, refusing to relinquish hertrophy. Maxim would come with her.She waded into the shallow river to meet the landing boat. Adessa glowered atthe Norukai greeting party as if their presence were an insult. “Adisappointingly small escort. The Norukai don’t fear me enough yet.”The raiders growled, as if incapable of normal human speech. She climbed intothe boat even before it came to shore, then sat imperiously at the bow while theNorukai rowed toward the serpent ship. She turned her back to the men andcradled the stained sack on her lap.Norukai crowded the rail on the upper deck, watching her with strange curiosity.From the waterline, Adessa scanned their faces, trying to determine which onewas Grieve.She saw a scarred, white-skinned man poking his head up and down, scuttlingsideways to get a better view. “My Grieve!” The albino cocked his head at theburly man beside him, who wore a thick chain around his waist and had bonespines implanted in his shoulders. “My Grieve, King Grieve! Make her grieve.”With the sack secured to her waist, Adessa left the landing boat and climbed aladder up the side of the serpent ship’s hull. She showed no fear as she stoodamong the raiders.“Death is in the air,” Maxim whispered from the sack. “Someone will die. Whowill you fight? Who will you kill, or who will kill you? Best prepare yourself,Adessa.”“Be quiet.” She climbed onto the deck and planted her feet firmly on thescrubbed wood. As the Norukai crowded around her, she drew her sword, standingdefiant. “Is King Grieve brave enough to face me? I want his blood.”The raiders guffawed. Grieve stepped forward, a truly hideous man. “Why would Iwaste my time fighting you? If I need practice, the Norukai are more worthysparring partners.”“You’ll fight me because I want to kill you,” Adessa said.The Norukai laughed at her audacity, and even Grieve chuckled. “A woman doesn’talways get what she wants. I have disappointed many who lusted after me.”The scarred sailors snickered. Adessa stared at him without answering. Grievelooked at the bloodstained sack at her side. “What is that? A gift for me?”She set the sack on top of a barrel and pulled down the cloth to reveal therotting head.The albino shaman capered in delight. “The axe cleaves the wood. The swordcleaves the bone!”“Quiet, Chalk.” As Grieve leaned closer, his scarred mouth drew down in a frown.“Who is this? Why would I want such a gift?”“It is not a gift for you. This is Wizard Commander Maxim from Ildakar. I wasordered to take his head.” She remained stony. Now that her hands were free, shetouched her short sword. “I intend to take your head as a second trophy.”The Norukai crowded closer, amused by the impending fight. As the darknessthickened, they brought lanterns to illuminate the open deck, clearing an areafor combat. Grieve held his wicked war axe in his right hand.“All right, let’s play,” he said.The two faced off."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 [part0003.html#a7]Disheartened and angry after so many soldiers had died in the meadow of deadlyflowers, General Utros’s army marched into the mountains. As their provisionalleader, First Commander Enoch rode his warhorse, donning a crimson cape toindicate his rank. His brass helmet gleamed in the sun, but his entire body feltlike iron, heavy and harder than the stone he and all the soldiers had been forcenturies.With the general himself on his way to Orogang, Enoch needed to lead more than ahundred thousand fighters, but he had never been an inspirational commander likeUtros. So many soldiers had already died since awakening from the petrificationspell, and they had all lost their families many centuries ago when they hadleft home for the last time under the banner of General Utros.Utros was the one who inspired that undying loyalty, and although Enoch tried tohold the army together, he could tell that cracks were showing in their ranks. Ahandful of stragglers from Ildakar had picked them off, one by one, and thenhundreds more died in the field of poison flowers, a trap. That had been a greatblow to their confidence in him.Enoch had not been at the forefront that day, but riding among the ranks toencourage the marching companies. His vanguard had been so easily provoked by afew gadflies, so heinously tricked. By the time Enoch had arrived to join thecharge, the broad meadow was already strewn with writhing bodies.Now, riding endlessly through the mountains, Enoch squeezed his fists, feelingthe stretch of his leather gauntlets. He wanted to bash each one of the rebelsagainst a rock. Even a thousand casualties had no significant effect on thegigantic force, but it was like a sword thrust through the heart of theirmorale.And he was in command.The soldiers were without supplies and starving, and they knew it, though keptalive thanks to the unsettling spell that altered their digestion andmetabolism. Their instinct forced them to strip the greenery off trees, grasses,and bushes, like locusts. They devoured any animal they caught. Enoch had a sicksuspicion that if the bodies of those fallen soldiers had not been impregnatedwith the deathrise poison, some of his most desperate troops might even haveeaten the human flesh. But he had rushed the thundering force up to the nextridge, away from the poisonous flowers and all that tempting meat. . . .Enoch drove the army harder as they climbed into the more rugged mountains. Hewished General Utros would come back and join them again. The army needed theirgeneral, though Enoch dreaded explaining such a failure to Utros once hereturned. . . .The marching force stretched out for half a mile, heading into the mountains, upabove the tree line and toward the highest pass ahead. Raising a gloved fist, heshouted loudly enough for the front ranks to hear his words, which would then bepassed along down the line of soldiers. “Scouts have found a large mountain lakeahead! We will camp there for the night. Just another hour, and we’ll be there.”Finally, they reached a cliff-ringed bowl below the last line of high peaks,where a clear mountain lake welcomed them. This would be their final camp beforea vigorous push up and over the pass of Kol Adair. The first ranks set up camparound the lake, finding patches of dry ground to sleep on.The pristine hanging valley looked peaceful and spectacular, and Enoch inhaleddeeply of the crisp, cold air. Though stark and forbidding, the crags werebeautiful in a wild way. Filled with snowmelt and stream runoff, the lakereflected the veils of late-afternoon clouds like a broad mirror.The sound of his soldiers setting up a camp, scrounging whatever scrub wood theycould find for campfires, created a comforting drone. Normally he would haveheard more chatter, boisterous challenges, gambling games, but the troops weresullen and exhausted.Enoch had devoted his life to serving in the army. He had marched proudlyalongside General Utros, but he had given up hope of a normal family, of thecontentment a retired veteran might expect with a small farm and an orchardoutside of Orogang. The general had handed him this responsibility now, andEnoch took satisfaction from leading this great army, although he was aware thatif Utros did not come back soon, some of these soldiers would desert the armyand go somewhere to live out their lives however they wished.As endless troops continued to march into the basin, supply sergeants filledbarrels of drinking water from the lake, and the cooks prepared scant meals withwhatever rations they had left. The rest of the fighters stripped out of theirarmor and rushed to the cold water to wash themselves. They splashed theirfaces, rinsed dirt-encrusted hair. Though the water was frigid, some swam out torocks protruding from the lake. At last, their tension began to ease, washedaway like the dust of the long march. Some soldiers even made makeshift fishingpoles from willow branches and went in search of trout.Suddenly an odd hush fell over the men on the shore, and Enoch felt somethingchange in the air. A few swimmers cried out in shock, then sank beneath thesurface, never to emerge. Others stood at the lake’s edge, wary, searching foran enemy.Far from the shore, Enoch cried, “Beware of the water!” He pushed his waythrough the troops, trying to get to the lake.The soldiers already crowding the shore peered transfixed into the deep waterand gasped. Several voluntarily dove in, still wearing armor, as if tempted byan irresistible force; they swam deep and did not resurface.More soldiers came running. One subcommander yelled at his company, grabbed theshoulder of a struggling man, and tried to drag him away from the shore, butthen he, too, stared in fascination, as if caught in a spell. He dropped to hisknees and plunged into the water, still wearing full chain mail. He drownedbefore he got far.Rather than being terrified, the soldiers at the lakeshore began calling outnames, full of yearning and wonder. “Alice! Alice, how are you here? I’ve missedyou so—!”“Jane! Oh, and our dear daughters! I’ll save you. I’ll join you!”“Ma! I can hear you. I can see you. Ma! Wait for me.”As if caught in their own bubble of obsessive focus, the soldiers didn’t heartheir own comrades right beside them. They could only see whatever had hold oftheir eyes and minds. In desperation and with no sense of self-preservation,they jumped into the water and swam away from shore. More warriors chargedforward, trying to stop their fellows, but the transfixed men fought back,refusing any rescue. In moments, the would-be saviors were also captivated bysome illusion and plunged to their own doom as well.They stretched out their arms, several of them sobbing. “I thought you weredead. How can you be here?”“I am coming for you.”Enoch had to save his men. “Retreat! Stay away from the lake.” He stormedforward, knocking soldiers aside, shoving their shoulders, pushing them to theground. “Are you fools? The water is dangerous. Get back!”He bowled men over and called for more troops to rescue their comrades, to dragthem away from the shore no matter what it took. “Don’t look in the water!” Hekicked others, heaved them aside, forced his way to the edge. It was madness,complete madness! He could not see what was attacking his troops.When Enoch looked at the lake, even though it was churned by struggling bodies,he caught sight of a patch of smooth water, and just beneath the surface he sawsubmerged faces, heard voices that tugged at his heart. Gritting his teeth, hetried to force himself to turn away . . . but the woman’s eyes caught him like arabbit in a snare. He recognized her face, the familiar smile with its endearingchipped front tooth, her wavy brown hair, her arched eyebrows that had drawn himin when she first smiled at him, so long ago.“Camille?” he whispered, and suddenly he could hear none of the commotion aroundhim. He was interested in nothing else. This was not possible!The very mention of her name strengthened the apparition. She reached up withdelicate fingers, straining toward the surface of the water from below. “Enoch,my love. I’ve waited for you, waited forever.”He felt as if his entire body had turned to stone all over again. “Camille?”“Enoch, why didn’t you join me? You left me behind. It was so long ago!”She was the closest thing to love he had ever allowed himself. Camille was abarmaid in a tavern in Orogang, and he saw her every time he returned to thecapital city. She always had a warm bed for him, but he refused to marry her,because he was a dedicated soldier. He knew he would be gone for months or yearsat a time and would likely die on a distant battlefield; he was too fond ofCamille to bind her like that.Still, she swore herself to him, said that she adored him. They had two youngsons, boys that Enoch barely knew, Aaron and Alex. As soon as he thought ofthem, the boys appeared beside Camille under the water. They had bright eyes,freckled faces, and curved noses, features that bore a hint of his own.“Father, come to us,” the boys cried in unison.Enoch gasped. He couldn’t stop himself from reaching forward. His heart ached.“Yes, I left you so many years ago. I didn’t mean to.” Although thousands ofsoldiers crowded in the basin around him, he heard nothing else, saw nothing buthis loved ones shimmering beneath the mountain tarn.“Come to us,” Camille pleaded. “The Keeper wants you. You are long overdue.”The grizzled face of his father appeared beside Enoch’s beloved woman and theirtwo sons. The old man had shown him much, taught him many hard lessons in life.His father had always retained a sense of humor along with a sense of wisdom.Enoch’s world spun, and the deep water seemed to call to him.The old man said, “You belong here in the underworld. With us.”Remembering his duty, Enoch dredged up a firm tone of command. He tried to keephis thoughts straight. “Who are you, truly? My father and family are long dead.”“Yes we are, and so should you be,” young Alex said in an eerily mature voice.“Come to us,” Camille said again.“Now that you and all your soldiers awakened, the Keeper has tasted your souls.He knows what he has been missing,” Enoch’s father said. “He knows what has beenstolen from him for all these years. You belong in the underworld. All of you.With us.”Knowing his father’s stern voice, Enoch flinched at the scolding.Aaron said, “You should have been here with us centuries ago. Now the Keeperwants you.”All of them said in unison, “He wants you all.”With a remarkable effort, Enoch broke his connection to them. He squeezed hiseyes shut and shook his head. He forced himself to lurch away and stumble backonto the shore, where he collapsed. The clamor around him returned with a rushof uncontrolled sound. Staring up at the sky, he suddenly heard all the moans,the longing outcries from his soldiers. They were dying by the hundreds,sacrificing themselves to the lake, giving themselves to the Keeper.“No!” Enoch dragged himself to his feet. His army was perishing before his eyes,countless ranks rushing into the lake. This was far worse than the meadow ofpoison flowers.The rear divisions still arriving at the lake saw that something terrible washappening, but they didn’t understand. Enoch pushed into the main encampment,bellowing commands in the voice that General Utros had taught him. “Do notlisten! Do not look into the water. Stay back!”He knew the ranks at the shore were lost, so many bodies already bobbingfacedown in the water. He wept as he turned his back on the desperate pleas ofhis beloved family, but he refused to take the easy way out. He yelled at thenearest lieutenant. “Rescue the ones you can, but do not approach the water!”The frightened soldiers passed his instructions along, spreading the warninglike wildfire. Enoch grappled with his own men, pulling as many as he could awayfrom the shore. Those who came too close looked in horror at the countlessfloating corpses, yet they did not comprehend the danger.Tears poured down Enoch’s battle-scarred face as he forced his army to skirt thelake and head directly toward the mountain pass. “Abandon camp! Keep riding! Wecannot stop here.”He mounted his horse and led them away from the trap at a full gallop. Tens ofthousands of soldiers followed him in confusion and terror, pushing on into thecold mountains. Enoch felt his heart turn to stone again as he rode highertoward the pass, wondering whether his entire army was truly alive, or if allthese soldiers had actually died long ago and just didn’t realize it yet."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33 [part0003.html#a7]Weak from blood loss and utter exhaustion, Nicci fell into a sleep as deep as acoma. Mrra remained in the cool bedchamber, protecting her sister panther fromdanger. The big cat curled up beside her, and Nicci took comfort in the dense,soft fur, the powerful feline body.The bloodthirsty zhiss were bottled up, dwindling and starving, and the HiddenPeople could at last reclaim their city and emerge into the sunlight again.In the depths of her sleep, though, loud sounds reached her. Nicci awoke toturmoil inside the stone buildings. She sat bolt upright despite her lingeringweariness. Mrra sprang to her feet and faced the splintered remnants of the doorshe had shredded with her claws in order to break free the night before. Niccislid off the bed, her head throbbing with pain, her knees shaky. Thanks tohundreds of the biting zhiss, her pale skin was mottled with maroon bloodblisters. She tried to shake off the fuzziness. “Come, Mrra. Let’s go see.”With the cat loping along beside her, Nicci ran down the torchlit corridorstoward the main entrance. The Hidden People were crowded at the high doorway,staring out into the daylight as if still fearful of the sun.Crouching in the shadows, young Asha turned to her with an expression full ofhope and desperation. “Nicci, we need your help!” When the girl clutched herarm, Nicci winced, feeling the bruises and bite wounds across her skin.She felt intensely weary. “I already saved you. Have the zhiss escaped?”A man nearby shook his head. “No, not the zhiss—an army! He’s come back!”She was surprised and confused by the statement. “What army?”“A thousand soldiers bearing the emblem of Emperor Kurgan! Cyrus said it wasGeneral Utros.” Asha hung her head. “He’s dead now.”That made no sense. “General Utros is far away. Why would he come here?”“This is his capital,” said another man, hiding in his gray robes. “He has twosorceresses with him. Cyrus and a dozen followers went out to greet him, but thesorceresses blasted them to bones and ashes.”At this news, Nicci felt her strength return in a surge, though her ears stillrang and her head throbbed. She worked her way past the drab people and stood inthe towering doorway. “Two sorceresses?”Out in the sunlight, she saw the glare reflected from countless shields, swords,chain mail, and armor plate. Hundreds of mounted troops filled the main plaza.Riding a black stallion, General Utros wore his distinctive horned helmet andgolden mask. Beside him, dismounted, stood two bald women with designs paintedon their skin.Without hesitating, Nicci strode out into the bright sunlight to challenge them.*The stench of roasting flesh wafted into the air. Utros held the reins as helooked down at the gray-clad bodies his sorceresses had blasted. Now he needednew captives he could interrogate.Ava looked downcast that she had disappointed her general. “Surely, they meantto attack.”Ruva said, “Look in the shadows. Many more are lurking here. They infest yourcity, what is left of it. We must eradicate them.”Fine swords were clutched in the blackened skeletal hands of the strangevictims. Utros wondered if the furtive, gray-clad men were the remnants of somelost army left behind in the ruins. Wary now, he looked around at the greattowers, the carved monoliths that depicted the exaggerated glories of Iron Fang.The city seemed more ominous now that the sorceresses had destroyed the firstattackers—or were they merely emissaries? Curiosity seekers? They shouldn’t havebeen killed so quickly.He shouted out to the shadows. “I am General Utros, and I have returned toOrogang. If your emperor is not worthy, then I will be your new ruler.”His words were loud enough to startle pigeons from the high eaves. His soldiersflooded into the plaza, lining up their horses in ranks. He heard the jingle oftack, the rustle of leather armor, the sliding musical note of swords beingdrawn from scabbards as they waited in the ominous silence.“Show yourselves!” Ava cried. “Bow down before General Utros.”Ruva muttered, “Like beetles hiding inside a rotted log.” In disgust, she lookedat the blackened corpses on the flagstones in front of them. “We will eradicatethem all so we can take back your city.”Since the pale figures seemed frightened of simple daylight, Utros decided theymust be mere scavengers, human leftovers who did not belong in this gloriouscapital. Utros turned to his troops. “Break into companies and move through themajor buildings. Sweep them clean. Round up those people. We will interrogatethem.”He faced the still-imposing palace that had been Iron Fang’s seat of power. Heremembered the towers that stretched toward the heavens, the supportingbuttresses, the arched windows that were now all bricked up.The main palace entrance was open, though, and figures huddled inside. They musthave seen Ava and Ruva blast the first group of emissaries, and he planned tostrike greater fear in their hearts. He would ride his black stallion throughthe gates and directly into the grand throne room like a conquering hero.Then one person strode boldly into the daylight, carrying herself with pride.Unlike the tattered gray rags that covered the others, this woman wore a blackdress that clung to her shapely form. Her blond hair was raggedly cropped, andher piercing blue eyes stared at him as if his soldiers and sorceresses simplyweren’t there. She had eyes for him, and him alone.“I was ready to defeat you at Ildakar, General Utros,” Nicci said. “Now I willdrive you from Orogang as well.”*With the bright sunlight on her blood-mottled skin, Nicci dredged up all herstrength. She didn’t dare let Utros or his sorceresses see how drained sheremained from the previous night’s battle.Ava and Ruva skewered her with their glare, and then the two raised their handsin unison, ready to attack. Nicci could sense the waves as they summoned theirgift, and she readied her shields. She had every intention of destroying thetwins, but her real enemy was the ancient general.Nicci called back to all the downtrodden Hidden People watching from shadoweddoors and windows. “Behold the man whose statue you revered, whose legends youtold. General Utros.” She glared at the blackened skeletons sprawled on theflagstones in front of his black horse. “Cyrus and his followers worshiped him,came to offer their swords to him—and he wiped them out. What will he do to therest of you? General Utros is not your hero. He wants to subdue the Old Worldfor his own gain.”“We thought you had vanished along with Ildakar,” Utros growled at her. “Who arethese people huddled in the shadows of Orogang? Why do they infest my capitalcity?”“They are the descendants of those who overthrew Emperor Kurgan and claimed thecity as their own.” Nicci took another step closer. “You are not welcome here.”Ava and Ruva called on their gift, and an angry knot of clouds appeared overtheir heads. The wind whipped up, startling the horses of the ancient army.Nicci called up an invisible shield to deflect their initial forays, though itcost her an alarming effort. Showing no weakness, though, she didn’t tear hergaze from Utros. “If the great commander needs lackeys for protection, then thelegend of General Utros has dwindled indeed.”The twins snarled, curling their fingers to build another attack.Utros halted them with a gesture. “I don’t need them to protect me, but I canlet Ava and Ruva play.” He released them.On foot, the twin women glided toward Nicci like reptiles on a hot rock. She metthem with a smile that was sharper than any sword edge. “You tried to kill meand my friends, attacked me with my own hair.” She touched her ragged blondlocks. “It’s time I repaid you for that.”With a thought and a push, she created wizard’s fire, a shimmering and searingglobe in her hand, which she hurled into the crowded soldiers in the plaza. Themolten flash incinerated five of the warriors and threw the remaining ranks intodisarray.Unexpectedly, the heavy doors of the stone buildings swung open behind her, andcrowds of Hidden People emerged, angry at what they had seen and inspired byNicci’s words. Shouting, they rushed out in a surprisingly coordinated assault,carrying weapons from the armory that Cyrus and his followers had maintained forcenturies.The general’s army swung their horses around in the plaza, and theironce-coordinated ranks faltered as they faced ghostly attackers who swarmedtoward them from every building in surprising numbers.Utros lifted his gold-masked face and shouted orders. “Eradicate them! Yououtnumber the enemy ten to one.”In a great clash across the plaza, the ancient soldiers fought the cloakedopponents, hacking them down. But more and more Hidden People emerged from thebuildings, the force growing every minute.Ava launched a wave of dazzling light at Nicci, whose shield deflected theblast. The effort made her stagger backward, though, and she shored up herdefenses, trying to find more strength in her core as she pushed herself towardthe twin sorceresses.Ruva made a whiplike gesture with her arm, and the black thunderhead overheadswirled into an ominous storm. Nicci retaliated with a curtain of air thatslammed the woman into her sister. The general fought to keep his stallion undercontrol as it reared.Facing the reckless charge of the Hidden People, the ancient soldiers brokeranks and fought in individual battles. Many wheeled their mounts and used thesharp hooves to strike down their pale attackers, while others hacked down withtheir swords.The surging Hidden People stabbed the warhorses, chopped at the soldiers’ legs,and pulled them from their saddles. The air rang with screams and the clang ofweapons.Amid the clamor, Nicci heard a primal snarl, and Mrra leaped into the fray. Thebig panther pounced on the ancient soldiers and tore out throats and ripped openchests.Pushing forward, Nicci swept her hands apart and sent waves of wind thatbuffeted the mounted soldiers as if they were game pieces on a har’kur board.The Hidden People darted into the disarray with their sharp blades, while Mrralunged in with fangs and claws.Utros kicked his horse into a gallop as he charged to the other side of theplaza. The twin sorceresses each sent searing lightning at Nicci, which shedeflected. The ricocheting bolts shattered the flagstones. With her eyes on herreal enemy, she focused on Utros.Carefully manipulating her gift, Nicci found the stone resonance in a granitemonolith that loomed thirty feet high above the general. The segmented columnshuddered and wobbled as she moved the foundation stones. When she weakened theunderpinnings of the column’s base, cracks raced up through the bottom block andcrumbled it into powder. The great pillar began to topple toward Utros.He leaped off his horse and scrambled out of the way while the terrifiedstallion galloped off. With a tremendous crash, the monolith smashed into dozensof fragments, spraying rock splinters in all directions.“You are mine, Utros,” Nicci said, stalking after him. “Why bother to run?”The general turned his golden half mask toward her and drew the long sword athis side. “Run? I will squash you.”As she focused on him, Nicci was caught unawares from behind when Ava and Ruvathrew a combined blow of magic. The fabric of her black dress smoldered andburned her skin, but she extinguished it with a thought. Even though her legsshook with the exertion, she pressed forward. The air burned in her throat andnostrils.As the increasing battle swirled across the central complex of Orogang, Niccimentally sneered at the fallen statue of Emperor Kurgan, his arms and headbroken off, the features scoured away by time. Not far away, the mysterioussliph well sat empty and silent among the other monuments, and she thought itmight be fitting to throw General Utros down the bottomless pit.Unified against her counterattack, the twins hurled more lightning at Nicci, butshe strengthened her shields and turned to face them. Utros was just a man, nomatter how powerful or legendary he might be. The two sorceresses, however, weregenuine distractions.Ava sprang onto the body of the Kurgan statue and called another flash of lightthat dazzled Nicci. Below her, Ruva stomped hard, pounding her heel to send ashock wave through the flagstones, which rippled across the plaza.At just the right moment, Nicci leaped into the air and landed on the unstableflagstones after the wave had passed. She retaliated with a bolt of lightning,pure energy called from the sky. The twin sorceresses cast desperate shieldsthat crackled and sparked against the barrage.“I am stronger than you,” Nicci said.The twins retreated into the next plaza, and Nicci followed, vowing to eradicatethem. Without his horse now, the general charged toward them, his sword drawnand ready to fight alongside his sorceresses. They gathered beneath the titanicUtros statue that loomed over the high square.Ava and Ruva faced her, building their magic to defend their commander. Nicciconcentrated the air into a single force, forged an invisible knife, and slashedsideways with a razor of air. Ruva thrust up her shield and blocked the brunt ofthe attack, though Nicci’s unseen blade sliced a long furrow down her right arm.Ruva cried out in pain, and her sister responded by hurling a shock wave wovenwith a wall of fire.Nicci dodged, and the magical hammer blow swept past her and smashed the base ofthe Utros statue, cracking its pillar legs.Ruva wailed to see fractures spread through the muscular stone legs. Both womenscreamed as the enormous statue toppled toward them. Utros and Ruva scrambledaway from the impact area, but Ava darted in the other direction. She staggeredtwo steps away as the stone figure thundered to the ground. Waves of dust androck chips flew in all directions.Ava stared, horrified, her mouth agape. “Utros!”Nicci used that moment of vulnerability to call down another bolt of lightning,braided and twisted with both the Additive and Subtractive sides of magic. Thefierce energy slammed into Ava like a bright and dark spear, piercing her chest,shattering her spine, and blowing out her back.Ruva screamed. The agony and dismay in her voice nearly tore her throat open.Nicci could barely hold herself up after expending so much energy. Her kneesbuckled.Ruva bounded over the broken statue and grabbed her fallen sister. Wailing, shedropped to her knees and clutched Ava’s body, holding her sister against herchest.Next to the sorceresses, Utros raised his long sword, ready to kill Nicci.In her last moment of life, Ava clasped her sister weakly with one hand, but herchest was burned open, and she sagged into death.Nicci climbed back to her feet and summoned her gift again, created a ball ofwizard’s fire in each hand, and prepared to throw the pair of boiling suns atUtros.Ruva was absolutely destroyed, emotionally wrecked. “No! You can’t have him!”Wrapping her arm around her dead sister, she grasped Utros and squeezed her eyesshut, invoking some spell that Nicci didn’t recognize.With her last effort, Nicci hurled both spheres of wizard’s fire, an insatiableblaze that could burn through any substance. Ruva and Utros didn’t have achance.But before the fires struck, Ruva, Ava, and General Utros simply vanished, as ifthey had winked out of existence. The fireballs smashed into the broken plaza,but they burned only emptiness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 [part0003.html#a7]As the three serpent ships prepared to drop anchor for the night, Bannoncontinued scrubbing the boards with a stiff-bristled brush, though he had longsince removed any visible remnants of catfish blood and slime. With his ankleshackled to a pin in the deck, he had been on his knees for hours, and his handswere raw and bleeding. Several other slaves, including morose Erik, were tied ondeck nearby, forced to watch him.Bannon knew that if he could get free for only a moment, he would fling himselfover the side of the ship. He could stroke across the river and hide in thethickets—if he made it to the bank. The Norukai were skilled with theirbone-tipped spears, and one of the jagged weapons might skewer him before hemade it halfway to the shore.Then he wouldn’t be able to help Erik and the other captives either. He had tofind a better way.In the thickening dusk, he saw a bright bonfire ahead. He heard a poundingdrumbeat and loud voice as someone stood out on a spit of land, challenging theserpent ships. A lone woman stood silhouetted by the flames, lean and clad inblack leather wraps. A morazeth!At first he thought, he hoped, it was Lila, but he recognized the voice ofAdessa, the cruel morazeth leader from the combat pits of Ildakar. Adessa hadtaken his best friend Ian as her lover and then killed him in front of Bannon.He would never forgive her for that.But here she was, calling out a challenge to King Grieve. He hated Adessa, butshe was certainly no worse than the Norukai.Her challenge amused the scarred raiders, but Bannon knew they were fools tounderestimate her. When the two raiders rowed a landing boat out to fetch herfrom the shore, others checked the bindings of the slaves on deck. ShipwrightGara grabbed Bannon by the hair and dragged him to the side rail. “Enoughscrubbing for now. You can spend tomorrow scouring the deck. Again.” Gara lashedBannon’s wrists together and checked the chain around his ankle, but she keptlooking toward the serpent ship’s bow, where King Grieve waited for his morazethchallenger to climb aboard.Chalk pranced back down the deck, squatting next to Bannon. “She challenges KingGrieve! She will grieve.” He whispered close to Bannon’s ear, “Blood on thedeck, scrub, scrub! You’ll see.” Then he scuttled back to the bow, where Adessafaced the Norukai king.She revealed the rotting head and set the hideous trophy on a barrel. Althoughdecay had distorted the features, Bannon recognized Wizard Commander Maxim.“Sweet Sea Mother.”Ugly raiders crowded at the rails to watch the duel as Adessa and Grieve facedoff in the flickering lamplight. The king let out an explosive laugh and liftedhis heavy war axe while Adessa drew her short sword.With their backs to him, the crowded raiders blocked Bannon’s view, so he couldsee only glimpses of the combat. All the Norukai were focused on the unexpectedamusement of the battle. Meanwhile, the slaves remained silent, huddled andtrying to stay unnoticed at the stern.Against the jeering, laughter, and catcalls from the rowdy Norukai, Bannon hearda stirring from the river, a furtive splash along the hull. He heard a softthump, and realized that someone was climbing up onto the ship!He turned away to see a lithe figure clamber over the rail and quietly roll ontothe deck—another morazeth, her skin covered with branded runes, her short brownhair plastered to her head. Lila! A surge of hope set his pulse racing. Henearly leaped to his feet, despite the chain, but her gaze swung over him likethe lash of a whip. She held up a hand to silence him.At the front of the ship, the Norukai let out a loud cheer, and the clash ofblades rang out.“What are you doing here?” Bannon whispered. Optimism flared inside him.“Don’t be a fool, boy. I’m here to save you.”*Adessa confronted the Norukai king, who looked even uglier than many of thecombat beasts she had fought in the Ildakar arena. Maybe Grieve thought hisslashed cheeks and implanted bone spurs made him more fearsome. Adessa justfound them all the more reason to kill him, which was what she had promised todo. It would give Lila a diversion to free the young swordsman, and Adessaenjoyed the task. Throwing herself upon the Norukai king, she swung her sword,letting out an explosive breath with the effort.King Grieve was an ox of a man with a broad chest, swollen muscles, and asharkskin vest. He had the strength to wield his heavy war axe as if it were nomore than a dagger. Despite his size, he showed surprising agility as he archedhimself backward to avoid the point of Adessa’s sword. The Norukai spectatorswhooped at the near miss.Adessa put so much effort into her swing that she overbalanced herself when theweapon struck only air. As she caught her balance, the king smashed the side ofher head with his iron-augmented fist. Her skull rang, but she managed to danceout of the way while he swung his axe at her.Judging by their howls and laughter, the Norukai were convinced she would lose.On top of the barrel, Maxim regarded her with jellied eyes. She could hear hismalicious taunting in her mind, but the rotting head did not speak aloud so thatothers could hear. He was too devious for that, but she heard him laughinginside her head, louder than the rowdy Norukai. She shook her head fiercely, asif to drive away annoying gnats.She blocked Grieve’s axe with her sword, and even though her blade was muchsmaller, the blow deflected the king’s weapon. After his big axe swept past,Adessa lunged with her right foot and kicked him in the abdomen hard enough toknock the wind out of him.Enraged, Grieve swung his axe like a bludgeon, without finesse, but with enoughstrength that she barely avoided it.Hooting and whistling, the Norukai taunted her by throwing slimy objects thatsplattered her skin. Fish guts. It was a common trick from desperate fighters inthe combat arena, and she refused to let herself be distracted. She had facedaltered bears, spiny wolves, and sand panthers without flinching, and Grieve wasa monster just like the others.She and the king smashed together again, attacking, neither managing to land amortal wound.The albino shaman darted in among the spectators, then flitted out of viewagain. The simpering man made her skin crawl, but she concentrated on Grievewhile keeping her peripheral vision alert for treachery. She did not trust theNorukai to fight by honorable rules.The king grunted again, straining with the weight of his heavy axe. His studdedboot stepped on a pile of slippery fish guts, and he stumbled. Thedisorientation lasted no more than a heartbeat, but Adessa seized her chance.She raised the sword in her right hand, forcing him to defend himself, and withher left hand she snatched the small engraved wooden handle from her hip. Theagile knife—the specific morazeth weapon used to cause intense pain in theirvictims.Grieve regained his balance as she plunged in. He twisted his axe to block hershort sword, exactly as Adessa had expected him to do. He wasn’t watching theinsignificant object she held in her other hand.Adessa struck with the agile knife like a stinging bee and pierced him. The tinyblade was needle-thin, no longer than a knucklebone, but that was not where itspower lay. She doubted he even felt the puncture through his sharkskin vest.Until she slid her thumb over the rune and activated the magic.An overwhelming thunderclap of pain rocked through the Norukai king. Grievesnapped back, all of his muscles contracting with seemingly enough force tocrack his spine. His scarred jaw dropped open in a yawning scream that washorrifying enough to shock the Norukai observers. They gasped in disbelief.Adessa twisted the agile knife and continued to release the litany of pain. Withthis tiny weapon, she had made her bravest, strongest warrior trainees fall totheir knees and sob for release. She pressed harder.Then Maxim’s head began to laugh. With the soft neck stump squished on thebarrelhead, the hideous jaws stretched and the hollow, mocking voice slitheredout. “You won’t beat him. Come, join me in death, dear Adessa! That is where youbelong!”The voice was shocking, jarring. The Norukai were shouting, howling, demandingblood. Their king writhed under the pulse of the agile knife, and Adessa droveit in harder.“You are weak, Adessa!” Maxim taunted. “You know it!”She flinched, flung a poisonous glare at him. “Be quiet!”In the instant she was distracted, somehow, even with the needle of the agileknife still inside him, Grieve grabbed her left hand. He squeezed her wrist withunbelievable strength, a vise enhanced by the desperation of pain, and crushedthe bones, turning Adessa’s hand and forearm to pulp.A black thunder of unbelievable pain swirled behind her vision.Somewhere in the background clamor, Maxim was laughing again.Grieve grabbed her broken hand, snatched the agile knife from her mangled wrist,and shoved her backward.Adessa tried to lift her short sword, but the big man knocked her flat to thedeck. Her head struck the wooden boards, and more pain rang through her skull.She raised her knee to push him away, but Grieve had the agile knife now. Hecould not unleash the pain spell, and as a weapon it was no more than acobbler’s awl, but he stabbed her throat, then stabbed again, puncturing herjugular. He viciously dragged the small blade across her neck.Adessa felt warm blood splashing out. In a distant part of her mind, sherealized that her struggles were growing weaker.He hammered the tiny blade down, pounding and pounding like a butchertenderizing meat. With a constant wordless roar, Grieve stabbed her countlesstimes in a fury. Hundreds of puncture wounds mangled her face, throat, and chestinto a horror of ripped flesh. He kept stabbing long after she was dead.The Norukai howled with victory.*As soon as Lila dropped onto the deck, Bannon realized that he had alwaysexpected her to come. Optimism hadn’t failed him. While Adessa and Grieve foughtat the front of the ship, Lila darted over to him. Then Bannon saw that she hada familiar sword strapped to her back—Sturdy! For the first time in many days,genuine joy filled him.Lila used her knife to slash the rope around his wrists. He twisted until thecord snapped, and she set to work on the manacle around his ankle. Bannonwhispered to her, “You have to free the others too. They are my friends.”The slaves groaned. Some were panicked, others distraught. Erik pulled againsthis chains.Lila turned her hard gaze up to Bannon. Sweat ran down the side of her face,mixed with the drying river water. “I don’t have time, boy. I did not swear toprotect these others. I came to rescue you.”Inspecting the cuff around his ankle, Lila followed the chain to the pin screwedinto the deck boards. With Sturdy still strapped to her back, she dug into thewood with the point of her dagger, trying to uproot the pin.At the bow, the Norukai roared louder than before, and Bannon saw Adessa fall.King Grieve was upon her, stabbing and stabbing. Blood flew everywhere, sprayinghigh.Bannon groaned. “Sweet Sea Mother, he just killed her!”A flicker of shock and disbelief crossed Lila’s expression. She hesitated only amoment, then she worked harder at the chain. “I thought I would have more time.”She did not look up as Grieve continued mutilating the fallen morazeth. She wasbreathing harder.Bannon reached out. “Give me Sturdy! Please, I can help.”The raucous Norukai were still celebrating Grieve’s victory, but a pale figurescampered down the deck toward them. Bannon looked up as Chalk saw him, thenspotted Lila as well. The shaman suddenly jumped up and waved his arms,shouting, “Another fish! We caught another fish.”Even with their shouts of victory, some of the Norukai heard Chalk’s shrilloutcry and turned to see what had excited him.Lila yanked at Bannon’s chain, tugging as she tried to rip the anchor boltloose. Giving up all attempt to remain quiet, she hacked at the deck board.Trying to help, Bannon strained against the manacle, gritting his teeth.Chalk capered up to them, shouting for the Norukai to come. “Here! Here! Anotherfish! Come quick!”Lunging up, Lila punched the shaman hard in the face, doing anything to silencehim. Her blow knocked him backward as if he’d been thrown from a catapult. Chalkcrashed to the deck, squealing in pain and disbelief, pressing a palm to hissplit lip. He curled up into a ball and wailed. Bannon felt an unexpected guiltat seeing the albino hurt, but he pushed it away. They had no time!At the front of the ship, under the lantern light, the rotting head of WizardCommander Maxim began to shine with a sickly greenish glow. Its jaws moved andthe gelatinous eyes gleamed, as if rejoicing in the death of Adessa. The deadman let out a chilling nauseating laugh, mocking them all and horrifying them.Even Bannon heard it, and the sound made his skin crawl. The Norukai backedaway, breathless and uncertain. They stared at the head. When Maxim finishedlaughing, his remaining skin liquefied and slid down the skull, oozing into apuddle on the barrelhead. Then even the bones crumbled into fragments.But while Chalk kept screaming, the Norukai ran down the deck, saw Lila, androared in alarm. Many scarred raiders thundered toward them, their weaponsraised.Lila drew Sturdy from its lashings on her back and held the blade in front ofher. She crouched as if facing arena monsters, ready to defend him with herlife. Bannon kept straining on the chain, planting his feet, but he couldn’t ripthe bolt free.Erik and the other slaves also pulled against their bonds, shouting, desperateto get away. Bannon thought that if they all fought back at once, some of themmight even break free. But his hope dwindled as the howling Norukai closed in.King Grieve stormed forward, his boots crashing on the deck, his skin andsharkskin vest splashed with Adessa’s blood. When he saw Chalk sprawled on thedeck, nursing his bruised face and whimpering, he let out a roar of rage.For an instant Lila was ready to face all the Norukai, refusing to admitfailure, but Bannon groaned. “You’ll die, Lila. You can’t save me.” He knew itwas the right thing to do.Lila struggled with the impossibility, but when her expression changed, Bannonrealized that she knew he was right. She growled, “Not this time.” As theNorukai charged in to kill her, she vowed, “I will be back for you, boy.” Sheflipped herself over the side of the ship, and Bannon heard the splash as sheplunged into the river.Ignoring the bound slaves, the Norukai snatched up spears and raced to the rail,looking for the ripples as she swam away. Some hurled their weapons into thewater as if Lila were a channel catfish. They missed.Seething, Bannon knew they wouldn’t kill her. Lila would get away, and she wouldreturn for him.Miserable and shaken, King Grieve bent next to a whimpering Chalk, rocking hisgangly friend back and forth. The shaman poked at where blood dripped from hissplit lip and swollen cheek. Though covered with gore, the king tenderly touchedthe albino’s smashed face. “So sorry, Chalk. I should have protected you. Ishould have known Adessa was part of a plan. They tried to trick us.”Grieve rose ominously to his feet and glared at Bannon, whose hands were freethough the chain still pinned him to the deck. The king stalked forward. “Thatwoman hurt my Chalk. Now I repay the favor.”Grieve swung his iron-plated fist like a boulder into Bannon’s face, nearlydislocating his jaw. Stars erupted through his mind as he crashed against theside of the ship and slumped to the deck, stunned.“You deserve to die,” the king growled. “But I will give you pain instead.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 [part0003.html#a7]The general’s army clashed with the Hidden People in the streets of Orogang. Theregimental commanders rallied their troops to face the ragtag inhabitants, whoput up a surprising resistance, but Utros’s well-trained soldiers needed nofurther orders to slaughter the enemy.More and more pale, gray-clad fighters rushed out of the dark buildings. Whilethe disciplined army used well-practiced battle maneuvers, the Hidden Peoplefought with a frenzy that disrupted the rigid plans. It was like twothunderheads colliding with a sound of thunder.Nicci struggled to recover after Ruva and General Utros vanished along with thebody of the dead sorceress. The clamor was deafening, and she heaved hardbreaths, looking at the shattered marble face of the toppled Utros statue. Shehad expended so much of her gift that she could barely stand. Nicci brushedstone dust from her black dress as she dredged up energy within herself. She hadto help the Hidden People in their fight before they were slaughtered. Thoughher gift was weak, she touched the daggers at her waist, knowing she couldalways fight with knives.As the battle raged in the main plaza, the ancient soldiers did not at firstrealize that their commander had disappeared. They simply kept massacring thepoorly trained refugees who threw themselves recklessly upon them. Bodies laystrewn across the plaza, but Nicci realized the Hidden People were inflictingnumerous casualties themselves. They were hardened to sacrifices, and they weredetermined to win this fight.But they stood against a thousand well-trained warriors in full armor.Sword fights swirled through the streets, between buildings, under the imposingarchways. In hand-to-hand combat, the fighters dodged the rubble of toppledmonoliths and shattered statues.An ancient soldier lurched in front of Nicci, raising his bloody sword andleering at her, as if he assumed she would be an easy kill. He slashed,intending to gut her, but she deftly avoided the strike, slipped in under hisbackstroke, and jammed one dagger between the man’s legs. She drove upward intothe soft but crippling target, and the soldier collapsed with a squeaking wail.She could have taken the time to kill him, but decided to let him lie therescreaming as she ran onward. She had to turn this battle and save the HiddenPeople.Mrra let out a roar that shattered even the din around them. Thanks to theirspell bond, Nicci felt the big cat’s joy, the hot iron taste of fresh blood inher mouth. The sand panther drove a soldier to the ground and tore open hisleather armor. With blood dripping down her muzzle, Mrra let out an even louderroar, a summoning.Sleek, powerful feline forms bounded in, more than a dozen sand panthers in anew bestial army that struck primal fear into the enemy. The ancient warriorsscreamed as the huge cats bore them to the ground and ripped them open. Thepanthers somehow knew to avoid the gray-cloaked Hidden People and attacked onlythe soldiers of General Utros.Nicci strode in among the enemy, wielding a bloody dagger in each hand.Desperate men cried out for the general, and subcommanders demanded orders, buttheir leader could not respond. The mood changed like a shifting storm wind asrumors started to spread that Utros had left them. The mounted army started tofight with an increased intensity that bordered on violent desperation.The poor Hidden People had just been released from their heavy burden with thezhiss, and now it looked as if they would all die before they could reap thebenefits of their well-deserved freedom. Nicci felt a flare of anger and sadnessas she fought her way back toward the towering palace. Somehow, she would rallythe poor people and help them fight such an overwhelming enemy. Nicci did notaccept an impossible situation.She paused to assess what remained of her gift. When she felt the magicresonating within her, she knew that even diminished she was still a powerfulsorceress. She could help the Hidden People and save as many as possible.As she passed the empty sliph well, Nicci called on a few threads of her giftand created a small sphere of wizard’s fire in her palm. She paused there andfaced the fighting, ready to make a difference, to help the Hidden People win.Pulling on her magic, she tossed the ravenous fire. The looping, twisting flamesflared, then swelled into a greater flash as the fireball engulfed three enemysoldiers before fading. She had hoped for more.She struggled to find enough of her gift to create more fire. From behind her,she heard an unexpected rushing sound of gurgling liquid that pushed upward.She whirled to face the low sliph well in the plaza, where a roiling pool ofquicksilver rose above the mouth, shaping itself into an icily beautiful humanfigure. Nicci was taken aback. “Sliph!”Looming above the well, oblivious to the clamor of battle, the silver womanglowered at Nicci.Why had the sliph come now? “I called you many times,” Nicci said.“I heard, but I am not required to heed you.” The sliph’s face pinched into anangry expression. “I accept your terms. I will know about my Emperor Sulachan.Tell me everything.”“Not now, sliph! I will summon you later.”“Now,” the sliph said. “I will take you back to Serrimundi as you demand, andyou must tell me about Sulachan. That is the bargain.”Nicci raised a shield, trying to repel the sliph, but it wasn’t enough. “No,sliph! Not now.”“Breathe!” The quicksilver wave plunged down to engulf Nicci and dragged herdown into the well."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 [part0003.html#a7]Once the group descended out of the rugged mountains beyond Kol Adair, Nathanfelt heartened. General Zimmer led the horses at a faster pace across thenow-fertile valley. “On this terrain, we can get even farther ahead of the enemyarmy.”Nathan rocked in his saddle as the horse moved alongside the prelate. “Thesooner we get to Cliffwall, the more defenses we will be able to create.”Verna mused, “The scholars have been cataloging the materials for years, and thememmers are sorting the vital missing pieces. By now they must have found manybooks containing deadly spells.”Nathan looked across the bowl-shaped valley, remembering what it had been notlong ago. Those lakes and streams, the green expanses, the lush trees, had beendevastation for as far as he could see: cracked dry terrain, volcanic glass,broken fissures, all caused by the Lifedrinker, a hapless gifted student who hadtriggered more magic than he could handle. “It’s not finding the deadly spellsI’m worried about, my dear prelate. It is controlling the awful magic that canbe released.”Verna looked doubtfully at the verdant landscape in front of her. “I know thestories about the Lifedrinker, but Victoria restored all the vegetation with arejuvenation spell she found in the archives. Wasn’t the world saved because ofher?”Nathan clucked his tongue. “Dear spirits, who told you such nonsense? Victoriawas as dangerous as the Lifedrinker, but in a different way! She also triggereda spell she didn’t understand, and her explosive vegetation would have engulfedthe world. We stopped her only at a terrible, terrible cost.” His heart suddenlybeat harder, as if Ivan’s dark remnants relished the painful memory. “The poorgirl Thistle sacrificed her heart’s blood to give Nicci the weapon she needed.”His long white hair blew about his shoulders as he stared toward the deserthighlands where they would find Cliffwall. “Even if we do find powerful spells,will we be strong enough and wise enough to use them properly? That is whatworries me the most.”*The maze of canyons had hidden Cliffwall for millennia. The young scholarsOliver and Peretta now led the way, eager to get back home. The horses clatteredalong the stony floor of the wide entry canyon. Ahead, the towering tan wallsclosed together into what looked like a dead end, but it was merely an opticalillusion, with a hidden gap wide enough for two horses to travel side by side.The party worked their way through the gap, turned left then sharply right, andemerged into a wide sheltered canyon that looked like a paradise.Captain Trevor, the leader of the remaining Ildakaran escort guards, let out adry chuckle. “I don’t know how we ever found this in the first place. Our partywas staggering, weak, starving. We thought that Renn had led us astray.”Oron looked around him in amazement. “If the knowledge here is as extensive asyou suggest, then we will find some way to defeat General Utros.”“In that case,” Leo said, “the final result justifies all sacrifices.”Lady Olgya’s face pinched in a bitter expression. “Says a man who has made nosacrifices! You didn’t even have a wife or family in Ildakar. What have youlost? My son was killed by those soldiers!”Oron grumbled, “As was mine.”Nathan didn’t comment, since those two young men, Jed and Brock, had beendespicable people who had caused Bannon great pain. But grieving parents wouldremember a child however they wished.He raised his voice as they rode into the Cliffwall canyon. “The important thingis that General Utros and his army must never find this place. Cliffwall’sgreatest defense is its camouflage. Those thousands of enemy soldiers are on aforced march, and no doubt starving. They should walk right past these canyons.”“Then we could spring a trap,” said Perri, the youngest of the gifted defendersfrom Ildakar. “If we can figure out how.” She had been a shaper back in thecity, manipulating trees and vines into interesting topiary shapes. Her gift,though powerful, was likely too subtle to be useful in any large-scale attackagainst General Utros.“The Cliffwall records may suggest dozens of new methods of attack,” Verna said.“We could create a powerful gifted army of our own.”As they proceeded forward, Nathan drank in the view. A stream ran along thecanyon floor, flanked by fruit and nut orchards. Sheep grazed in open meadows,and terraced gardens lined the steep hillsides. People tending their flocks,working in their gardens, and fishing in the stream all looked up to watch theparty enter the canyon.The high, sheer walls were pocked with natural alcoves and overhangs, some ofwhich held a personal dwelling or two. The largest overhang held a veritablecity of knowledge. High up the cliff wall, a grotto contained buildings made ofadobe and hardened brick, some structures so tall they reached to the curvedrock ceiling. Stonemasons had added beautiful ornamentation on the façades andcarved archways over the grand doors of the main archive.Oron shaded his eyes and peered at the vertical cliff with a skepticalexpression. “How do we get up there? Is that supposed to be a path?”“There are stone steps, narrow but safe,” Oliver said. “You can climb them, ifyou have no fear.”Peretta added, “And anyone who is afraid should not look in the books andscrolls stored there.”Oron let out a snort in response to the implied insult.They dismounted at the base of the cliff beneath the great alcove, and GeneralZimmer’s soldiers led the horses away to join the soldiers who had remainedcamped in the canyon to guard the archive.Nathan set off up the steep zigzagging path chiseled into the sheer stone. Headjusted his sword so that it hung on the opposite hip as he climbed theprecarious trail. Not only did he look forward to studying the ancientdocuments, but he also wanted to patch and clean his clothes, repair a crack inhis boots, and replace his frayed laces with new ones.Verna toiled up the path behind him. When they finally reached the alcove highabove the canyon floor, Nathan paused to rest, breathing hard.Several Cliffwall scholars came running out to greet the returning party.“Nathan! And Prelate Verna!”He recognized Gloria, the matronly leader of the memmers, who had committedevery word of countless written volumes to memory. She was a round-faced womanwith short dark hair in an unattractive cut. Beside her walked Scholar-ArchivistFranklin, a studious, serious man in charge of all the students insideCliffwall.The Sisters of the Light who had stayed behind also emerged from the mainbuilding. “You’ve returned,” said Mab, one of the Sisters. “You’ve been toIldakar, and now you’re back. Tell us what you saw.”Another Sister, Arabella, asked, “Was Ildakar as grand as Renn claimed? Where ishe? Did he stay behind?”Nathan drew a deep breath. “We have a tale to tell indeed, but I’m afraid it isnot good news. Once more, we must search the knowledge in Cliffwall in order todefend the whole world.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37 [part0003.html#a7]Light sizzled around General Utros, a crackling web that swallowed him and torehim away from Orogang, the fighting soldiers, the wailing Ruva and her deadsister. His body went numb, completely blinded.Buffeted, weightless, tumbling in a void. He screamed, his skull twisted likethe lid of a jar, and his thoughts howled, detached. His bones elongated,tangled, flailed like limp ribbons. The air, the world—existence itself—foldedaround him, then refolded, and he could hear a scream outside him and within,wrapping around his thoughts.Ruva had caused this—he knew it. The sorceress had released some extreme form ofmagic to save them, but it had plunged him here. The light around Utros flaredbrighter until it became a wall of molten pain that hung and then shattered.The world unfolded again, and he spilled out.Reality crystallized in front of him, a landscape of mountains and sky. Hestaggered forward two steps, then his legs simply could not support him anymore.Utros crumpled to his knees, sprawled forward, and caught himself with splayedhands. He couldn’t breathe. His chest had been squeezed as if under animpossible weight of rocks.Nearby, Ruva appeared in a slash of lightning-intense glare. She clung to thecorpse of her twin sister. Smoke and the stench of burned flesh wafted up fromthe blackened crater in the middle of Ava’s chest.Disoriented, Utros looked up. His gold half mask had slid down his face to coverone of his eyes, and he adjusted it so he could see. The horned helmet tumbledonto the ground beside him, clattering among the stones and patchy alpinetundra. In front of him he saw countless armored figures, an encamped army.Having seen the flash of light from Ruva’s spell, they turned to him andsuddenly recognized their commander.“General!” one man cried. “General Utros has returned!”He sucked in a deep breath of biting air. He glanced around, noted the mountainpeaks, and realized that his huge army had already crossed the highest mountainsand was marching down the western side of the range.This didn’t make sense. “But we were in Orogang. How did we get here?” He turnedto the grieving sorceress, whose arms were still wrapped around the limp body ofher twin. “What did you do?”Ruva made inhuman sounds of sorrow. Her sister’s pale arms dangled, her fingerscurled in death. Ruva rocked her back and forth, rubbed the markings of soot anddried blood into a muddy smear of sadness. Utros shook her shoulders with bothcompassion and command. “Ruva, tell me what happened! How did we get here?” Theyhad to be many hundreds of miles from Orogang.The sorceress let Ava’s corpse drape across her lap. The dead woman’s eyes weremerely blackened sockets. Nicci’s surge of combined Additive and Subtractivelightning had raged through Ava’s heart and blasted out of her eyes.The nearby soldiers rushed closer. As word was passed, lieutenants came running,and he recognized First Commander Enoch. Utros had only a few moments to getanswers from the sorceress. Utros shook her again. “What did you do to us? Youleft a thousand soldiers in Orogang in the middle of a battle. Speak quickly!”A growl of vengeful fury boiled in Ruva’s throat. “I couldn’t leave you there todie, beloved Utros. Nicci killed my sister. I had to get us away from there, hadto save you. Ava . . .”“But how? How long have you known how to travel like this?”“I didn’t,” she said. “I didn’t think it would work, but I had no choice. A longtime ago, Ava and I learned of a dangerous distance-eating spell that woulderase all the miles between one point and another. I knew many anchors hereamong the soldiers, their keepsakes, even the sword and tack worn by FirstCommander Enoch. I pulled us here, though I thought we might die in transit.”Tears smeared the paint she had marked on her face. “I did it for you. My sisterwas dead, and I had to save you.”He felt a pang of sympathy for Ruva. As twins, their bodies fused at birth, thetwo had shared an immeasurably intimate connection, their gift entangled, theirthoughts practically identical. Even though they had been cut apart, Ava andRuva were inextricable. And now one of them was dead.“I am sorry for you.” He knew the horrible pain of losing his beloved Majel, butthis must be far worse. “You have always been loyal. I never questioned yourservice. You and your sister were the best among us, the finest.”“I’m sorry I left the army behind,” Ruva said. “Those soldiers are without acommander in an empty city.”Utros tried to console her. “They are a thousand of my best soldiers. If theycan’t wipe out a handful of refugees living in the shadows, then they do notdeserve to be part of my army.” He smiled gently with half of his face. “Ineffect, I now have a strong military contingent in Orogang, and once my soldiershave flushed out the vermin, they can reclaim the capital in my name. It is anaccidental victory.” He stroked her cheek, used the moisture from a fallen tearto smudge the paint in a straight line. “We just inadvertently placed the firstoccupation force to rebuild the empire.”The sorceress’s expression softened. “I cannot take us back there. The distancespell was dangerous. I nearly lost us in the void, and then we would never havereturned. I even used some of Ava’s gift as her spirit dwindled.”Utros lifted Ruva to her feet. Her dead twin lay on the tundra grasses. “I don’twish to go back to Orogang. I am here where I belong, with my army. I have tolead them across the Old World.”First Commander Enoch rushed up to them, his expression a mixture of relief andunanswered questions. He dropped to his knee, pressed a fist to his heart, andbowed before his general. “You are here! How is it possible?” He looked inhorror at Ava’s corpse. “What happened, sir?”“I am back. That’s what matters,” Utros said.Other subcommanders and curious soldiers rushed up, eager to hear the story.They dropped to their knees. Utros raised Enoch to his feet. “Report, FirstCommander. Tell me what happened while I was away.”Enoch briefly looked aside, nervous and distressed, then steeled himself toreport. “Your army has crossed the mountain pass of Kol Adair, sir, and we aredescending to the foothills. The soldiers keep marching, but they are veryhungry. Even with the spell.”“They will survive.” Utros looked at Ruva, and the sorceress gave a brusque nod.“But we have suffered many losses while you were gone, General.” Enochhesitated, then explained about the field of poison flowers and then the highmountain lake where so many troops had been lured into the water by their deadloved ones.“Keeper and spirits,” Utros whispered.“I do not blame them, sir,” Enoch said. “I felt it too. I saw my Camille, ourtwo sons, even my father. I barely broke away myself. We lost more than athousand fighters before I pulled the army away.”Utros absorbed another blow to the countless soldiers who had followed him underIron Fang’s banner.Enoch continued. “The Keeper wants us, sir. He knows we’ve avoided him forfifteen centuries, and now we are marked, more than a hundred thousand souls. Weall should have gone to the underworld long ago. They are effectively dead, butstill marching.”Utros felt a flare of anger. “The Keeper can’t have us yet. I need my army, andwe still have a war to win.”*Wrestling with grief while also stoking the fires of revenge, Ruva washed thebody of her sister and used a razor-sharp knife to shave any hint of hair fromher cold body, not a strand left behind.Ruva applied herself with reverence to this last task for her sister. She placedsmall round stones in Ava’s burned eye sockets, and wrapped boiled white clotharound her sister’s breasts to cover the black hole where her heart had been.When Ava was clean and pure again, Ruva made fresh pots of paint, blood red andpitch black, and painted new designs across the pale flesh, then reproduced thesymbols across her own body.When Ruva proclaimed that she and her sister were ready, General Utros commandedtwo of his soldiers to carry the bier and place it carefully atop an unlit pileof wood that would serve as a funeral pyre. Except for the white wrapping acrossthe burned hole in her chest, the slender woman lay naked on the kindling.Letting his arms hang at his sides, Utros turned to Ruva. “You are my sorceressnow. I trust you to be strong.”“I cannot be as strong without my sister,” Ruva said. “But I would do anythingfor you.”“As would we all, General,” said First Commander Enoch.His soldiers raised their voices in a shout of affirmation. Utros absorbed itall, and when the cheers fell silent, he called for torches to light the pyre.The dead willows caught fire quickly, and the flames grew to an intense blaze.“The Keeper will have to be satisfied with Ava for now,” Utros shouted to hisarmy, “for the rest of you are needed here!”The pyre roared so bright and hot that Utros had to step back. Transfixed, Ruvastayed close to the blaze as the fires blackened her twin’s flesh and destroyedthe painted markings. Ava’s skin cracked as the fire consumed her. Her face fellaway, leaving only a skull with two pebbles inside the eye sockets. Though theintense heat reddened Ruva’s own skin, she refused to retreat. Utros grasped herarm and pulled her away, pressing the slender woman’s shoulders against hischest armor.As the orange fire devoured the remnants of Ava’s body, the pyre shifted and theflames swirled as if a whirlwind had caught the embers in a circle. The colorchanged from a bright yellow to a sickly green as Ava’s bones fell apart intothe core of the fire. A translucent green image rose from the flames,insubstantial and shimmering.The soldiers gasped in superstitious terror. Ruva let out a low moan thatsounded like surprise, not fear. The apparition sharpened, became more intense,and Utros recognized the dead sorceress.“Ava, you aren’t in the underworld!” Ruva cried.“I cannot go.” Ava’s spectral form brightened to stand out against the bonfire,where her blackened bones crumbled into the embers.Utros held on to Ruva with his powerful arms, although she struggled to breakfree and throw herself into the flames. He needed to know Ava’s purpose. “Hasyour spirit decided to remain with us? Did the Keeper allow it?”“My sister and I are twins,” said Ava’s shimmering form. “We are bound together,heart and mind and soul. We share the same Han. The Keeper marked both of us. Asinfants, after our bodies were cut apart, we two died briefly and traveledthrough the veil, but a healer brought us back to life and snatched our soulsfrom the underworld. The Keeper knows us. He is waiting for us . . . but heneeds both of us.” The shimmering spirit hovered before Ruva. “My sister mustpass through the veil with me. I cannot go alone.”Ruva looked longingly at her twin, but pressed her shoulders back hard againstthe general’s chest. “No, I must remain here. You know it.”Ava laughed. “And therefore, I must remain! You are an anchor that keeps myspirit here in this world. I am trapped between life and death.” The greenishspirit flitted directly through First Commander Enoch, shocking him, and thenshe circled the soldiers, who scattered in panic. She wafted back through thefire, entirely unharmed. “I am a spirit unfettered by physical form. I can gowherever I wish, see whatever I like.”She swooped closer to Utros. He was not afraid, but intrigued. Her spectral facewas very close to his as she hovered before him. “And then I can report backhere.” She smiled. “Beloved Utros, I will be your perfect spy!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 [part0003.html#a7]When she plunged into the river from the stern of the serpent ship, Lila swamdeep. The shouting Norukai hurled their spears into the water, but she didn’thead toward the shore as they expected. Rather, she stroked powerfully down thecurrent and moved far ahead of the three anchored ships. When her lungs wereabout to burst, she surfaced again and forced herself to exhale with only awhisper of sound. Far behind, she could still hear the raiders raging at herescape. She suspected Bannon would pay a price for her failure, but she knew hecould endure it. She had made him tough.She wrapped her arm around a floating log, and it kept her above the surface asshe drifted downstream. With the serpent ships anchored for the night, Lilarealized she would be able to cover a great distance if she simply floated onthe current all night long.Then she would be far enough ahead to make another attempt to rescue Bannon.Resting, she let her thoughts drift just like the brown water around her. Lilatried to process how she had failed, and how Adessa could have been so brutallydefeated. Lila felt dismayed and empty; although she had seen many trainees andmorazeth sisters die in combat, Adessa had been different, seemingly invincible.She had fought the Norukai king so Lila could rescue Bannon. And they both hadfailed. Adessa was dead, and the young swordsman remained a prisoner.“I will not give up on you, boy,” she muttered as river water lapped against thefloating log.Locking her arms and legs around branches, Lila dozed for an hour or two andwoke when her feet brushed against a large slimy creature beneath her. Startled,she grabbed her dagger. The sword was still strapped to her back, but shecouldn’t get it in time. As faint dawn suffused the eastern sky, she could seelarge forms swimming next to her, each smooth tan body as large as a canoe. Thechannel catfish lumbered along, not predatory, only dangerous because of theirsize. Lila drew her legs against the floating log, and the catfish swam past herinto the widening channel.In the light of sunrise, Lila looked around and saw how far she had traveledduring the night. The sight struck her with awe, then alarm.The widening river sprawled into a diverse delta of numerous channels andsandbars. Beyond the land’s end, she saw the estuary spill into the ocean, anopen expanse of blue water that extended to the horizon. Lila had never seensuch a sight in her life. The Killraven River ended here.She released the log and drifted in the water, swimming to a low sandbar coveredwith tufts of grasses. Lila had gotten a substantial head start on the serpentships, but they would come soon, on their way to the sea. Once the big shipspassed the estuary and reached the open ocean, Lila knew she would never be ableto catch them. This was her last chance to free Bannon.She had to stop them.*For half an hour after Lila escaped, King Grieve coddled Chalk, touching theshaman’s battered face, wrapping a big arm around his scrawny shoulder.Consoling his albino friend seemed to make him even angrier. “I’ll make them allgrieve.”Chained to the deck while the ships remained anchored during the night, Bannoncould not escape King Grieve’s fury. The big man strode up to him, his heavyboots ringing loud on the boards. His war axe was still stained with Adessa’sblood spray.The bolt holding Bannon’s chain remained set in place, and when the young mantugged on it, he felt the sharp scabs and bruises of the manacle around hisankle. Big Erik sat nearby in the darkness, knees drawn up to his chest,shoulders hunched with contained sobs.Bannon steeled himself, sure that Grieve meant to lop his head off, but Chalkscuttled over to them. The shaman was miserable from his smashed face, but hetouched the king’s arm to stop him. Grieve shook him off and stood over Bannon,raised the weapon. The young man glared at him, knowing he couldn’t escape, andthe Norukai king brought down the heavy weapon with a hard thunk into the woodof the deck, smashing the plank so he could uproot the anchor bolt.Chalk bobbed his head and clapped his hands in delight. “The axe cleaves thewood! The sword cleaves the bone!”Grieve uprooted the chain and dragged Bannon by the legs toward a pool of lightfrom one of the lanterns. “Scrub the blood from the deck and get rid of the deadwoman. Feed her to the catfish.”Grieve kicked at Erik. “You! Help him!” The big man shuddered and moaned,paralyzed.“I’ll do it myself,” Bannon said, climbing to his feet and grabbing the brush.“Leave my friend alone.” He realized it was the wrong thing to say as soon asthe words passed his lips.“You have no friends,” the king said.Dropping the axe, he wrapped his big hands around Erik’s head and pressed hardagainst his temples and cheeks. The captive’s eyes went wide, and his mouthdropped open in a wail. Grieve’s muscles bulged with the effort as he snappedthe other man’s head sideways in an abrupt vicious turn. The bone cracked, andErik’s feet jittered on the deck, clanking the ankle chain.Bannon felt sick, his knees weak as he forced himself to remain standing. OtherNorukai crowded close, making sure he did not try to dive over the side, butBannon was paralyzed by the sight of his dead friend.King Grieve wasn’t finished, though. With an additional grunt he twisted thehead around even more, snapping and grinding the neck bones, stretching the skinand tendons. Erik’s head faced entirely the wrong direction. With another severejerk, Grieve twisted again until the neck popped and tore, and then he wrenchedErik’s head off his shoulders, uprooting the spine with the ragged cord stilldangling down.Grieve shoved the limp body onto the deck boards. “Now you have another mess toclean up.”The remaining slaves whimpered, but Bannon refused to reward the king with anyreaction. He clenched and unclenched his fists, feeling murderous rage towardGrieve and all Norukai, as well as dismay that he had let his friend down. Ifonly he had a chance . . .With an offhand gesture the king tossed Erik’s head overboard, and Bannon heardit splash into the dark river where Lila had vanished more than an hour ago. Ifshe came back, the young man imagined he and the morazeth together could kill adozen of the ugly raiders . . . but it wouldn’t be enough.“Clean up the woman’s body,” Grieve sneered. “I’ll dispose of this garbage.”Seeming to take pleasure in the labor, he raised his axe again and brought itdown in an abrupt stroke that struck off Erik’s foot just above the iron shackleso he could drag the body from the chain.Chalk let out a high-pitched laugh. “The axe does cleave the bone!”Bannon knew that the albino had saved him, staying King Grieve, but he couldhave saved Erik, too. Chalk’s eyes were bright as he capered around, distracted.Grieve heaved the headless body over the side of the serpent ship. Eager tohelp, Chalk ran up, grabbed Erik’s severed foot, and flung it into the river,following the larger body with a smaller splash.“Feed the fish!” Chalk cried. “Make them grow big.”Bannon hardened his heart with the certainty that someday he would be free andsomeday he would kill King Grieve.Moving stiffly with pain, he went to the bow, where Adessa’s disfigured body layon the deck. Her face, throat, and chest were like pounded meat. The kingthought he was punishing Bannon by forcing him to see the bloody morazethleader, but Bannon had hated Adessa, too, although he felt no elation at seeingthe woman dead. He couldn’t understand why Adessa would have been any part ofLila’s plan to help free him, but she had provided a distraction that gave Lilaa chance, though not enough.Bannon slung the morazeth leader’s mangled body over his shoulder and grimacedwhen he felt the wet pulp of her skin, the oozing blood and tissue. She feltlight, empty, for such a fearsome warrior. The Norukai sailors watched, amused,as he rolled her overboard into the darkness.“Feed the fish!” Chalk cried. “Big fish.”With a queasy stomach, Bannon turned to Maxim’s collapsed skull and sloughed,rotten flesh. He shuddered as he remembered the unmistakable maniacal laugh, thetaunting voice of the dead. He feared the slain wizard commander’s spirit mightreturn.Bannon upended the barrel and dumped the mess overboard, where it joinedAdessa’s body in the river.Many of the Norukai lounged back and snored for the remaining hours of thenight, though edgy guards stayed close to Bannon. He concentrated on scrubbingthe blood and washing the deck clean with buckets of river water. The workwasn’t much different from cleaning fish guts and slime, but this was thesmeared remnants of human beings.As if keeping him company, Chalk pestered him for hours, even if his words wereslurred due to his split and swollen lip. Bannon did his best to ignore thebothersome shaman, though each time he saw the scars from the myriad bite markson the pale skin, he shuddered from the ordeal the outcast had endured.After sunrise, when the deck was scoured clean five times over, the Norukai tiedBannon next to the other slaves again, and Chalk found a spot beside a woodencrate, where he curled up and went to sleep.When the morning brightened enough for them to see the channel ahead, theNorukai raised their anchors and stretched the dark sails to drift down theriver again. The slaves sat quietly under the hot sun, searching for remnants ofhope. If they tried to speak to one another, the Norukai would beat them.Near noon, the crew grew visibly excited when they could see the estuary ahead,the widening mouth where the river spilled into the vast open water.“I can’t wait to be out on the ocean again,” Gara said, then let out a mournfulwhistle. “My ships were made for the open sea.”With longing in his heart, Bannon remembered spending time on sailing ships,even the doomed Wavewalker. As a boy on Chiriya Island, he had watched thegraceful vessels sail off to places he could only dream of. He had always wantedto sail the seas, and now he was a captive of the hideous raiders. He had nohope of escape, unless Chalk could help him. . . .As the raider vessels cruised into the delta, shouts of surprise came from thebow. Norukai hurried to the front of the ship. Some of the raiders guffawed andjoked, pointing over the side. Bannon strained against his bindings to see whathad drawn their attention, but too many burly bodies blocked his view.King Grieve stood by the carved serpent figurehead, and he let out an angrysnort. “I can kill her just as easily as I killed the last one. Go get her.”Out in the widening estuary where sandbars and hummocks confused the directroute to the ocean, a woman stood alone on a sandbar in the middle of the river,waiting for the serpent ships to arrive.Lila.*When Bannon watched the Norukai bring the new prisoner on board, she was trussedlike an animal killed in a hunt. Her wrists and ankles were bound, as if theraiders feared her, and with good reason. They dropped Lila heavily onto thedeck, and she smothered her grunt as her head struck the wood. She glared atthem in defiance.When she saw Bannon, her stony expression softened and her eyes lit up. Chalkcringed and scuttled away from the woman who had struck him.Grieve bent down to relieve Lila of her dagger, then—gingerly—her agile knife.“You won’t be using these again.” He threw both weapons over the side.Next, he pulled the sword that was bound to her back, holding up Sturdy.Bannon’s heart surged at seeing his trusty weapon. He had bought the discoloredblade from a swordsmith in Tanimura. Nathan had trained him in its use aboardthe Wavewalker, and Bannon had killed many enemies with it, including countlessNorukai. He strained against his bonds. If only he could get the weapon, hisfamiliar blade—“Ugly sword,” Grieve said. He unceremoniously threw it overboard into the river.Bannon bit back an outcry. Sturdy! The sword tumbled and spun in the air beforeit splashed into the deepening water. The serpent ships sailed on, past theestuary toward the open sea.Bannon slumped back. Sturdy was gone, sunk to the bottom of the river’s mouth.Lila managed to sit upright, and Chalk pranced over to her, reluctant toapproach the morazeth. His cheek and mouth were swollen, puffy with blossomingbruises, and blood from the split lip caked his pale mouth.Glancing at the shaman’s damaged face, Grieve glared down at Lila. “This is forwhat you did to my Chalk.” He slugged her face hard, knocking her to the deckwith blood pouring from her smashed nose and split lip. Though Lila didn’t makea sound, Bannon groaned in anticipation of what he knew was to come.The serpent ships left the coast and headed out to sea."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 [part0003.html#a7]After their reunion at Cliffwall, Nathan and his companions prepared to defendthe world. They didn’t have much time.Even the staunchest fighters could not hope to drive off the gigantic army,should Utros find the isolated archive, so their best defense lay in remaininghidden in the maze of canyons. On a forced march to the coast, General Utroswould have no reason to explore these side canyons, so the scholars should besafe while they planned.As he stood outside in the open alcove in front of the main building, Nathanregarded the prophecy building that now lay slumped and melted against the farwall, its windows scarred over like wet clay. It had been destroyed by a foolishstudent who accidentally released a “Weeping Stone” spell without understandinghow to control it. Nathan sighed at yet another reminder of the dangerousknowledge in the archive.A knot of dread formed in his stomach as he considered so many naive anduntrained scholars ransacking the archive for equally powerful magic. What ifanother eager but foolish scholar unleashed a dangerous spell that got out ofhand? He, Prelate Verna, and the Sisters of the Light would have to serve as acheck before anyone used such destructive magic.He stroked his chin as he gazed out to the green canyon, the orchards, theflocks of sheep. These isolated people had vanished from the world thousands ofyears ago, during the great war. When Sulachan declared that all magical lore berounded up and destroyed, many valiant wizards had secretly stockpiled old booksand scrolls, preserving the information here in the wilderness. Now, perhapsthat knowledge could be used to defend against General Utros.Nathan sighed. Every time one terrible enemy was vanquished, another appeared—adiscouraging thought. But maybe he should look at it the other way around. Forevery enemy that threatened the world, there would always be defenders likehimself, Nicci, Richard, and Kahlan to stand against tyranny, proving to bestronger than evil, again and again.This time would be no different.Inhaling another breath of fresh air and solitude, Nathan turned back to themain archive building, which contained far too many books to read. Somewhere,there would be at least one good solution.Inside the vaulted library chamber, glowing lights hovered above study tables,illuminated by simple spells that the young novices used for practice. Scholarssat at individual desks or at long tables piled with books. They all searchedfor new ideas, some unorthodox spell that could help stop the ancient army.Gloria distributed volumes for her avid memmers to peruse. Traditional scholarssearched volume after volume, categorizing the books so that the Sisters of theLight could locate relevant subjects for more careful study.Nathan was impressed by how engrossed they were in their search. The men andwomen bent over faded words, compared notes, and deciphered near-forgottenlanguages. The air in the chamber seemed to throb with the intensity of theirthoughts.Verna looked up from a long scroll spread out on the main table. Novice Amberand Sisters Mab, Sharon, and Arabella sat close to the prelate, sharing booksand indicating passages they found of interest. Seeing him in the doorway, Vernaraised her voice. “Can you read the documents by standing all the way overthere, Nathan? Your eyesight must be extraordinary.”“I was pondering, my dear prelate.” He came in and seated himself on the benchbeside Amber, and the prelate handed him a stack of books as if she were aschoolmistress. “We haven’t reviewed these yet. Of the five hundred tomes westudied today, we set aside fifteen that are worth a second look. It is hardwork.”“Well, well, fifteen are better than none.” He opened the cover of the firstbook, which was filled with nautical charts. He wondered how such a book hadever found its way so far inland, but he doubted it would contain anything theycould use against the marching army. He set the tome aside.For the next several hours, Nathan fell into a routine, studying spines andtitles, occasionally recognizing an author. Some books were written in thealphabet of Ildakar, which he had learned from Elsa during their stay in thecity. Some languages were incomprehensible to him, so he returned those books tothe stack in hopes that someone else might recognize the writing. Several bookswere written in High D’Haran, and one volume sent a tingle through his skin. Heleaned closer. “This is in the language of Creation.”“That bodes well. It must be extraordinarily powerful,” Verna said. “If you canread it?”Nathan took that as a challenge. “I am somewhat versed in the language ofCreation, but it requires a great deal of interpretation.”He spent an hour on that book alone, while the scholars and the Sisterscataloged, studied, and discarded dozens of volumes. Finally, he admitteddefeat. “Too much of a challenge, even for me.” He clucked his tongue againsthis teeth. “I was adept at constructed spells, but these words have an unknownfoundation. If only Richard were here! That boy was quite skilled in workingconstructed spells, far beyond my talents.”“Yes, Richard was the best student ever, the only war wizard born in thousandsof years.” Verna closed a green leather-bound book, which sported a prominentdried bloodstain. “But we don’t have him now. We have only ourselves. And wehave all this.” She gestured to the crowded shelves that lined the walls of thelibrary, as well as the countless tunnels and archive vaults, the satellitebuildings, even the innumerable sealed chests preserved by spells long ago.“That should be enough.”“We just need to find out how, my dear,” he said.*Alone in the small austere chamber they had assigned him, Nathan fell into adeep sleep, still exhausted from the long and arduous trek. His mind and heartfelt bruised from the loss of dear Elsa. Ildakar was gone, and he didn’t knowwhether Bannon and Nicci were alive or dead.He tossed and turned on his narrow pallet. In his dreams he went back toIldakar, but he felt a darkness around his memories. His heart pounded like adrum inside his chest, and he sank deeper into the dream. Subconsciously, herealized that he wasn’t looking through his own eyes.Nathan saw himself in the combat arena, but his body felt different, solid andmuscular. He brushed the front of his vest, finding not his usual ruffled whiteshirt, but the pelt of a sand panther . . . a sand panther he himself hadskinned after killing it. After Ivan had killed it!The chief handler’s heart thundered in his chest. Ivan had been a cruel man whoenjoyed torturing the beasts he created. He would beat them into submission, buthe valued them, if only because they served as his killing machines.Still sleeping, captured by the unwelcome dream, Nathan felt a rush ofexhilaration as he remembered harassing a huge, caged combat bear. Fleshmancershad created the beasts for the arena, and Ivan’s gift could control thecreatures’ rudimentary brains. He remembered jabbing the bear with a sharpstick, making the monster crash into the iron bars of his cage. It had clawsthat could rip a horse apart.Deeply asleep, Nathan stirred, tried to fight off the nightmare. Ivan was dead,mauled to death by his own animals. The man’s heart had restored Nathan as awizard, but it was Nathan’s gift, and Nathan’s heart now! Not Ivan’s.Some lingering part of the chief handler’s spirit brought back memories oftormenting monstrous bulls with branched horns, spiny boars with razor tusks.Ivan had wrestled each beast himself before turning them loose in the arenaagainst their victims.As Nathan dreamed, his hands flexed, and he smelled blood and dust in the air.He poked and prodded three sand panthers until they lashed out at him with fangsand claws, but Ivan just laughed and drove them away. In the dream, Nathan sawthe sand panthers turn on him, snarling. They bounded closer, ready to tear himapart—He woke up, sweating. He clenched his hands, appalled at what his heartremembered, and he realized that a part of him had enjoyed the torture. It wasnot a real part of him, though, just some leftover contamination from the chiefhandler’s heart.“Stay away from me. Get out of my head!” With an effort, he drove Ivan’spresence away, and the dead man faded to whispers in his mind and in his heart.Shaking, knowing he would never go back to sleep, Nathan went to the small deskand took out his life book. He opened it to the last few blank pages, where hewould write down his real thoughts, his real adventures. That was what he wantedto remember."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 [part0003.html#a7]The silver whirlwind of the sliph swept Nicci away from Orogang. She had been sodesperate to leave, had tried repeatedly to summon the sliph, to no avail. Butnow she couldn’t leave the city, not in the middle of the battle! If Nicciwasn’t there to help the outnumbered Hidden People, Utros’s army would conquerthe ancient capital. All of the people would be slaughtered.Yet the sliph had her, filled her, carried her along. Nicci struggled to staywhere she was, but she couldn’t break free. The molten silver rushed into hermouth and nostrils, plunged into her lungs, abducted her. She didn’t want to go!She felt as ineffective as a small child battering at an adult in frustration.Nicci lost track of time and distance. She was helpless, and not in gentlehands. This rebellious sliph was malicious. In transit, Nicci experienced theprimal fear of suffocating, drowning. She tumbled along, disembodied.Finally, after an infinite yet unknown amount of time, she hurtled back to thereal world, and there was nothing calm about their arrival. The sliph burst outof her well at the temple in Serrimundi, and the metal froth boiled up over thelip, dumping Nicci onto the ground.She sprawled onto the flagstones, retching to purge the substance from herlungs, mouth, and nose. She scrambled to her knees, glaring back at the well,and shouted, “Why did you take me? I did not wish to travel now!”Orogang was on the other side of the land. Even without General Utros to leadthem, those thousand regimented soldiers would make short work of the gray-cladrefugees. She thought of Mrra and her sand panthers against the ancientwarriors, and all those poorly trained Hidden People who fought for their lives,defending the ruins of the city that had been their home.Nicci glared up at the shifting metallic sliph that loomed up from the well. “Icalled you repeatedly, but you were silent. Why now? Why did you take me when Iwas needed in Orogang?”The creature’s expression was like a thunderstorm as it grimaced in anger, andher hair flowed and squirmed like silver lava. With high cheekbones and thinlips, she had been a beauty in life, but now she looked blank and inhuman.“Because I wished to.” The sliph sounded petulant. “I never wanted to taste youagain, nor serve you. You are a traitor. You tricked me.”Nicci rose to her feet and faced the sliph without fear. “I served my own cause,and your cause was long gone, a failure from thousands of years ago.”“So long as I exist, the cause is not dead.” The sliph’s sculpted metal garmentflickered and shifted. The molded silver of her cheeks hardened, and her mouthtwisted in a sneer. “Now you will tell me what I need to know. I fulfilled yourdemand. I brought you to Serrimundi. Tell me about Sulachan!”The sliph grew more powerful, more terrifying as she drew silvery material fromthe depths of the well to swell her form. Her metallic locks of hair thrashedlike twisted whips.Seeing her, Nicci remembered the huge carving at the entrance to SerrimundiHarbor, the Sea Mother, protector of the Old World, a hard yet benevolentgoddess that many people along the coast revered. The Sea Mother looked exactlylike the sliph. No doubt in some forgotten past a superstitious city dweller hadseen the sliph, imagined some kind of deity, and created a whole religion aroundthat misconception. But Nicci knew the sliph was just a being that had beenaltered by ancient wizards, not a goddess.Nicci kept her gaze locked on the gleaming woman. “I will tell you aboutSulachan. I fought him myself, and I helped bring about his downfall, but it wasLord Richard Rahl who finally destroyed him.”Distraught, the sliph loomed and listened as Nicci told the known history ofSulachan, how he had forged the People’s Alliance and commanded his wizards tocreate an army of subhumans to fight the New World, and how he was eventuallydefeated, bottled up behind the great barrier.As she listened, the silver woman’s expression roiled and her shoulders slumped,but then she straightened with a bitter anger. “If Sulachan was dead threethousand years ago, then how did he return? Why was he not victorious?”“He was resurrected with some of Richard Rahl’s blood, thanks to a traitor namedHannis Arc. Sulachan returned with an army of soulless half people, but theywere all wiped out. Defeated completely.” Obligated to fulfill her promise,Nicci described the last war in the Dark Lands, how the armies of D’Hara hadfought against the undead hordes, and how Richard Rahl had finally destroyedSulachan beneath the Garden of Life in the People’s Palace.Her voice had an edge of hard satisfaction as she wrapped up the tale. “Sulachanwas vanquished, hurled back into the underworld. Lord Rahl was a war wizard. Hechanged the underpinnings of the world using the language of Creation, andSulachan was too weak to beat him. He failed completely.” Her voice rose as shefound more energy, more anger and satisfaction. Nicci crossed her arms over herchest. “Sulachan is dead, never to return. Your cause, the People’s Alliance, isno more.”The devastating news was the only weapon Nicci could use to punish the sliph forwhat she had done. “Your cause is not only ended but it is useless. It wasalways useless. Sulachan’s plan was doomed to fail from the beginning. You arethe only thing that remains of it.”The sliph cringed at the information, as if the words whipped her with barbedlashes. The quicksilver face stretched, melted, twisted, and then her mouthwidened in a distorted and horrific snarl. “You are lying!”Nicci stood before the well, adamant. “You know I’m not. You hear the truth inmy words. You gave up your life for nothing all those years ago.”The metallic fluid brightened as if it had become white-hot, and the amorphousmolten shape changed as the beautiful woman transformed into a ferocious demon.Her body enlarged and her two arms elongated, stretching into tentacles thatstruck down with hooked claws. Nicci dove to the flagstones and rolled, dodgingthe blow, but the sliph shifted her entire form, forsaking her human figure.Four more quicksilver tentacles boiled out of her torso.“Yes, come travel with me and never return!” The hooked tentacles lashed atNicci. “I will drag you down and keep you within me forever. I’ll drown you andcrush your lungs so that you will be as dead as my master Sulachan.”A silvery arm wrapped around Nicci like a twisted iron bar, but she summoned hergift to flood the silver form with heat until it ran like hot liquid. She brokefree of the appendage and ducked under it, pulling herself away. Her black dresswas smoking, and the skin on her arms reddened with burns.Nicci backed away, giving herself just enough time to create wizard’s fire. Shethrew the blazing sphere at the sliph, but curtains of silver folded around thefire and swallowed the destructive flame. The metal body bubbled and twisted,but somehow absorbed the energy.Nicci retreated from the sliph well until she reached the wall of the emptytemple. The silver tentacles stretched toward her, as flexible as hot wax and ashard as steel. The tentacles slammed down, trying to crush Nicci, but she dodgedagain. The blow shattered the stones on the temple floor, and the backlash fromanother appendage struck a figurine of the Sea Mother inside the temple,smashing it into splinters of stone.The tentacles grew spines as they whipped past Nicci. She called sharp bolts oflightning and blasted the sliph, searing jagged holes through the quicksilver,which shifted and sealed again. A tentacle wrapped around Nicci’s arm andsqueezed tighter than a manacle, while another surrounded her waist, winding sotight that she couldn’t breathe. The mass of appendages pulled her back towardthe well. “I will drag you down, and you will never breathe again!”As Nicci fought, the malleable sliph could reshape herself and recover from anydamage. She had already used so much of her gift battling Ava and Ruva, andbefore that the zhiss cloud had weakened her. Nicci was spent, but she had tofind strength or she would die. She realized she had only enough power left fora single strike, but she didn’t dare waste her last chance on another failure.As the tentacles dragged her closer to the well opening, Nicci found a differenttarget and decided to gamble, hoping it would be her best chance to free herselffrom this monster. She used the destructive energy to make the ground shake andshift, then unleashed a final heavy blast of lightning—but not at the sliph.Instead, she struck the circular stone wall around the well, blocking off thedeep hole. The explosion came from several different directions, and the stoneblocks tumbled in. The barrier collapsed, and the well opening fell in onitself.The sliph shrieked as the walls crashed down like an avalanche. The fallenblocks severed the quicksilver tentacles, lopping off three of them, and themetal appendages dropped loose onto the cracked temple floor. Wailing, the mainbody of the sliph retreated by plunging down into the endless tunnels. Moreblocks fell in and closed over the top of the well. Breathing heavily, Niccicrawled forward and fused the edges to hold the stones in place.She dropped to her knees, but she wasn’t done yet. She raised her hand and usedher gift to reshape the unstable stone blocks, softening and smoothing them sothey formed an impenetrable lid to seal the sliph well forever.She slumped in utter exhaustion while her thoughts swam.Something cold and metallic seized her leg like the grasping hand of a dyingman. She kicked out to break free. The three severed tentacles flopped aboutlike headless snakes. They were discolored now, no longer bright silver, buttarnished. The twitching slowed, and the writhing tentacles finally fellmotionless, no longer metal, but an oily black mucus that oozed between thecracks in the flagstones.Nicci climbed to her feet again and heaved deep breaths. The pale yellow lightof daybreak filtered through the temple of the Sea Mother. She had gotten backto Serrimundi, as she wanted, although she had left Mrra and the Hidden Peoplebehind. And now she couldn’t ever get back to Orogang in time to help them. Thesliph well was completely sealed, and she knew she would never travel in thatmanner again. She could not say whether the sliph herself was dead.Nicci was stranded in Serrimundi. But there was another war to prepare for.She heard quiet weeping and gasps of misery behind her, and she turned, readyfor another battle. Her black travel dress was tattered, her blond hair atangled, sweaty mess, but she was Nicci, Death’s Mistress, and she could defeatanyone else who threatened her.Five terrified supplicants stood just outside the temple. They had come at dawncarrying baskets of fruit and fish as offerings, which they had dropped as theywatched Nicci battle the frightening silver apparition. Now the supplicantsstared at the shattered statue, the collapsed well.“The Sea Mother,” one of them sobbed. “You killed the Sea Mother!”“Your Sea Mother was not what you believed her to be.” Nicci hardened her voiceand strode to the entryway. “Now, take me to the harborlord.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41 [part0003.html#a7]The Cliffwall scholars worked all day, every day, poring over the wealth ofdocuments. The kitchens served the scholars their meals at the library tables soas not to interrupt their frantic searches. With the army of General Utrosmarching relentlessly over the mountains, they had little time.Cliffwall banked everything on the hope that the archive would remain hidden,since no one in the ancient military force knew it was there. But with a threatto the entire Old World, Nathan didn’t just want to hide. Somewhere in this vasttreasure trove of magical lore they would find something to stop General Utrosfrom conquering the cities and lands of the Old World.Nathan and Verna moved through the corridors that honeycombed the mesa to acavernous document storeroom. The rock-walled chamber had high shelves filledwith books, some piled haphazardly, others neatly arranged. He smelled the dust,the paper, the leather. Inside the chamber, he could hear workers sorting,shelving, discussing what they found.Stepping inside the door, he ran his fingers along the spines on the firstshelf. His nails made a clicking sound from cover to cover to cover. “The sheernumber of volumes is exhilarating, my dear prelate.” He gave her a wry smile.“Perhaps if I were imprisoned here for a thousand years, I might be able tograsp it all.”“One man for a thousand years,” Verna said, “or thousands of scholars workingtogether. We can put in the same number of hours in far less time. But if eachperson’s knowledge is separate and incomplete, how will we know which pieces toput together?”He stroked his chin. “Dear spirits, so much to organize. We know how powerfulthe right spell could be—and how dangerous.”“We don’t have the luxury of being cautious,” Verna said. “If we find somethingthat might work, we have to hope we can control it. I’m confident in myabilities, and you never had any doubts either.” She looked intently at Nathan.“In fact, the Sisters of the Light were terrified of you.”“Terrified? Prelate Ann was never fooled. She would come and keep me companyeven when I raged with my visions of prophecy. Ah, I miss her.”Just inside the doorway of the document-storage chamber, a heavyset man with afringe of hair hunched over an open volume on a tiny table. As the scholars cameto him with books, he transcribed the titles in his ledger. His quill swirledlike a bumblebee as he scribbled the letters, dipping like a stinger into theinkpot and writing another line without ever mistakenly letting a drip of blackfall onto the page.Young men and women scurried from shelf to shelf, arms laden with volumes,moving with a hush that seemed natural inside such a sacred library. The roomwas lit only by an illumination spell, since candles or torches might ignite allthe paper tomes and scrolls.One spindly man carried a load of books stacked up to his nose, while his fellowscholars removed volumes from his pile and arranged them on shelves. Aflustered, mousy woman pushed a cart past them with volumes that belonged in adifferent storeroom.Scholar-Archivist Franklin guided a team of novices along with Sisters Rhoda andArabella. Franklin’s robes were rumpled, and his eyes were bloodshot andshadowed. When he saw Nathan and Verna, he flashed a relieved smile. “I’m gladto report significant progress. We have brought the books containing powerfulspells here to this chamber.” He sighed and gestured to the creaking shelves.“This is where you start, your best bet. Once you’ve finished reading all ofthese, we will bring more.”“We will get right to it,” Nathan said.“I hear you’ve already found the Weeping Stone spell that melted the prophecyarchives,” Verna said. “The one your student couldn’t control.”“Elbert was a fool to attempt it,” Franklin said. “Not power-mad or ambitious,but untrained and not inclined to consider consequences.”“Too foolish even to know how great a fool he was,” Nathan said, clucking histongue. “That is the most dangerous kind.”The prelate was more intrigued than frightened. “We should make note of such apowerful spell. It must be based on braided magic tied to the fundamentalstructure of stone. It could allow us to melt a mountainside.”“Melt a mountainside? Against General Utros?” Nathan felt uneasy. “And what ifyou can’t stop the spell once it gets started?”Verna pulled a faded gray book off a shelf and looked at it, but she wasdistracted. “It is still worth considering, if we should need it.”Franklin showed them an ornate urn of glazed blue porcelain sitting on a shelf.“We found this in Elbert’s quarters after he accidentally melted the prophecyarchive. I decided to keep it next to the documentation of the Weeping Stonespell.” He removed the lid of the urn, and Nathan and Verna peered closer. “Thiswas a necessary component of the spell-form.”Nathan saw fine grains at the bottom of the urn, white sand with an unusualprismatic shimmer. “Dear spirits, that’s sorcerer’s sand!”Verna nodded. “I can see why that would be a key to triggering a great spell.”She looked worriedly at Nathan. “If Elbert used half an urn of sand withoutknowing what he was doing, no wonder the walls collapsed! So much power! We’relucky he didn’t destroy the whole archive.”“So this isn’t just plain sand?” the scholar-archivist asked. “We were going todump it out as we cleaned up the clutter.”Nathan gasped. “Oh no, don’t do that!”Verna relieved Franklin of his burden, protectively holding the urn. “We’ll keepthis ourselves. Sorcerer’s sand is powerful and rare, but even a few grains canact as a catalyst for releasing enormous magic.” She secured the porcelain lidin place. “This is very important.”Two scholars shelving books on the far side of the chamber cried out insurprise. Nathan heard the muffled clatter of volumes tumbling to the floor inan avalanche. A young man bolted around the end of the shelves. “A spirit! Aspirit in the archives!”Hearing more shouts, Nathan and Verna ran toward the last row of stacks, whereanother cascade of disturbed books thumped to the floor, pages strewneverywhere. The wooden shelves rattled. A second scholar tripped on the hem ofher robe and sprawled, knocking an armful of scrolls onto the floor.A shapely but insubstantial female figure flitted toward them in a shimmer ofgreen glow. She was hairless and painted with symbols, but she seemed onlypartially there, a whisper of a human being.Nathan’s boots slid on the smooth stone floor as he skittered to a stop. “You’reone of the general’s sorceresses!”Her image wavered, and her face shifted from beauty to hardened vengeance. Herflickering form became razor sharp. “Such a lovely archive. Such interestinginformation.”“Begone from this place!” Verna shouted, calling power into her voice. The otherSisters of the Light joined her, staring at the image.The spectral image just laughed. “I found you! Now I know where you hide.” Hervoice had the hollow coldness of a winter wind.“Which one are you?” Nathan demanded, stepping forward to face the green-tingedspirit. “Which sorceress? Ava or Ruva?”“I am the dead one. I am Ava.” She flitted to the ceiling before she swoopeddown, unbound by gravity or any physical form. “Nicci killed me, but I am stillhere. I will help destroy you all!”As the glowing figure lunged toward them, Nathan lashed out with his gift todefend them, though part of his mind rejoiced in the knowledge that Nicci wasstill alive and had fought the sorceress. As the spirit came closer, he called awind that blasted directly through the insubstantial form and succeeded only inrustling the piled books on the shelves behind her.“I am here, but not here!” Laughing, Ava swooped through the bookcases, but madeherself substantial enough to knock volumes loose and send them flying. Nathanand Verna ducked as Ava pelted them with a hailstorm of tomes. One sharp-edgedbook struck Franklin in the forehead, and he collided with the shelves besidehim.Ava taunted as she rose up, her green shimmer flaring brighter. “I will tellGeneral Utros about this magical archive and guide the entire army here. Mysister will help him ransack it and seize all the knowledge.” She seemed amused.“You are all doomed.”Alarmed, Verna called up a shield. “Block her, Nathan! We can trap her, bottleher up.” Sisters Rhoda and Arabella also called on their gift and joined theeffort. “We don’t dare let her escape now that she knows where Cliffwall is.”Nathan helped weave an invisible wall of magic, but Ava’s spirit was too swiftand insubstantial. She slipped through them, darting along the lines of shelvesas more young scholars scattered in panic.Sitting at his little table, the portly recorder lurched out of his unsteadyseat as the spirit blasted past. His inkpot spilled all over his ledger, and afountain of black liquid sprayed in the air as Ava swooped by. She careenedthrough the archive shelves like a phantasmal battering ram, knocking the booksinto disarray. The wooden shelves creaked and bent, on the verge of collapse.Ava’s spirit reached the stone wall and vanished directly through the rock,leaving only the chaos of settling papers and slumping books in her wake.Franklin groaned in dismay as he looked at the storm of disrupted volumes. Bookslay scattered with broken spines. Many pages had torn, the covers sheared off.Nathan looked at Verna in deep concern. “We can’t remain hidden anymore. GeneralUtros knows where we are.”*In camp after another day of marching through the foothills, the general staredat his campfire, trying to read messages in the flames. He felt the sadness ofall he had lost, the loyalty to his emperor, the illicit love of an empress, andthe fresh grief of Ava’s death. Utros shouldered the responsibility for thosemany thousands of loyal soldiers who had died in his service. Was conqueringeven a continent enough?Ruva squatted by the fire, hardened and disturbed by the loss of her twin. WhenAva’s spirit had manifested itself, Ruva’s broken heart had twisted with an evenmore intense determination, and now the painted sorceress stared into the flamesat the general’s side, both lost in their own thoughts.The flames flared, and Ava’s insubstantial figure rose from the fire, perfectlyformed as in life, identical to her sister except for the mirror-image scars ontheir outer legs. Ruva gasped and opened her arms in an embrace. Ava driftedclose and matched Ruva’s position, overlapping as if the two of them were fusingtheir auras into one united being.General Utros faced the oddly doubled figure, awaiting the report of hisspectral spy. Seeing the incorporeal image, First Commander Enoch also hurriedover from his nearby tent.When Ava spoke, Ruva’s mouth moved in tandem. Their words overlapped with aneerie resonance. “Beloved Utros, I have vital information. I searched the land,I followed connections, and I found the wizard Nathan Rahl and his infuriatingcompanions.”Her expression brightened with hungry anticipation. “They have a hidden archiveof powerful lore within a few days’ march. The countless books are filled withincredible magic, devastating spells that Ruva could use to help you subdue theland. If you conquer Cliffwall, General, we could take all that information forourselves.” Her shimmering face smiled. “It would guarantee your victory overthe land.”This was something Utros had never considered. An arsenal of forgotten magicallore? “Can you tell us where to find this archive?”“Yes, beloved Utros,” the two women said in harmony. “It is hidden in a sidecanyon, and they have almost no defenses. They rely on camouflage to protectthemselves. We would easily take the archive.”Utros smiled. Even here at night, he kept the gold mask in place as part of whohe was. He looked up at Enoch. “Cliffwall is our new target, First Commander.”He stared around at all the bright campfires like winking eyes spread across thehills where his army had camped. “Once we overwhelm the archive, we will stripit clean.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42 [part0003.html#a7]The sea was wide open around the Norukai ships as they lost sight of shore.Bannon took no joy in the expansive sight, even though it reminded him of how heand Ian had once stood on the beach at Chiriya Island, watching the ships sailby. The two had dreamed of seeing the world, though Bannon mostly just wanted toescape his father.Now he dreaded where King Grieve was taking them, to the main Norukai islands.Belowdecks, the oar master pounded on his drum, and the unfortunate slaveschained to the benches pulled at the oars to drive the serpent ships faster thanthe sluggish breeze.After being beaten unconscious at the river mouth, Lila had been tossed to thedeck near Bannon, her ankle also secured with a chain, the chain that had onceimprisoned Erik. Now the morazeth lay bruised and battered, a captive just likehim. Bannon couldn’t understand why she had allowed herself to be captured. Shehad caused it! It seemed a foolish risk.As she lay motionless under the hot sun, he studied the symbols that marked herskin. The runes protected her against magic, but they did nothing against thebrutal Norukai. Her body was mottled with bruises.Lila finally groaned, and her eyelids flickered open. She snapped awake in aninstant, fully conscious and alert. She thrashed against the ankle chain, andher wince told Bannon just how much pain she must feel. When her gaze locked onto his, she visibly relaxed. “So, I succeeded then. My memory is . . . fogged.”“You certainly drew their attention.” The words bubbled out of him, rising inintensity. “That was a foolish stunt! Why would you do that? We’re bothprisoners. Now you’re in as bad a place as I am.”“I am in the same place as you are,” Lila said, as if that were reason enough.“That was my intent.”“But why? What can you hope to achieve here?”“More than I could achieve if these ships sailed off and I never saw you again.It was the only way I could stay with you. Now we have a chance.”Bannon hung his head, and his long hair drooped over his face. “A chance? Youare maddening. I don’t understand how you think.”She frowned. “It is perfectly obvious. The Norukai ships were going out to sea,and that was my last opportunity to intercept them. If they had sailed into theocean, how else could I rescue you?”“This isn’t much of a rescue,” he said.“Obviously, I am not finished yet.” She winced again as she shifted her body toinspect her bruises. She flexed her fingers, ran her tongue over the caked bloodon her smashed lip. “I will heal.” She strained at the bindings around herwrists until blood stained the knotted rope. “I can work myself free eventually,but the ankle chain will be problematic.”He looked across the open water, but he could no longer see the coastline, onlyendless ocean. “I have no doubts about you, Lila. I know what you’re capableof.”“Of course you don’t have any doubts. I have never given you any reason to.”Now that she was helpless, he feared the Norukai would drag her across the deckand rape her, although most of the raiders seemed to prefer their own beefywomen, and their nightly lovemaking on the open deck sounded more like a brawl.Still, he had seen Norukai men ravish three of the female Ildakaran captives,treating them so brutally that two were mad and one was dead and tossedoverboard. They thought of their slaves as nothing more than “walking meat.”Lila was a beautiful woman with a lean and shapely body. He dreaded what wouldhappen to her, but he also felt a sick inevitability.The first night at sea, a sneering young Norukai with fresh red scars on hisface grabbed Lila’s leg chain, unfastened it, and dragged her away. She didn’tscream. Instead, she coiled, made herself ready. Bannon threw himself to the endof his own chain. “Leave her alone!”The Norukai laughed, but Bannon was more stung when Lila turned and snapped athim, “Be quiet, boy! You only make it worse. I can handle this.” She tugged onher own chain, pulling back against the raider, but the Norukai yanked the metallinks, nearly dislocating her shoulder.After the Norukai man dragged her into the shadows beside stacked crates ofstolen supplies, Bannon strained to hear her voice, sure that Lila wouldchallenge her attacker, but she spoke no words. He heard a scuffle, a grunt,then a scream—but it was not Lila’s scream.The Norukai man reeled back out of the gloom, drunk with agony, as he staggeredacross the deck. Holding her own chain, Lila stalked back to return to Bannon’sside. Several Norukai came running in response to their comrade’s groans. Hepressed his palms to his crotch and blood dribbled between his fingers. Theangry Norukai stared at Lila, but she faced them defiantly, holding up a fleshyhandful in her palm. “I tore off his testicles, but I stopped at that. Ifanother man tries to take me, I will make him eat them as well.”She tossed the bloody sac with a splat onto the deck. The would-be rapistwhimpered, then collapsed in a bloody mess. The Norukai prowled toward Lila,ready to tear her to pieces.Bannon hoped his leg chain would be long enough for him to fight. Lila stood herground and prepared to die.King Grieve strode over and saw the writhing, moaning man on the deck, thebloody testicle sac next to him, and he guffawed. Moments later, the otherNorukai joined the king in bellowing laughter. “Throw him overboard,” Grievesaid. “Worthless.”They tossed the moaning raider, still alive, into the sea.Lila went back to her place beside Bannon, and the angry Norukai men glowered ather before loudly declaring that she was too scrawny for their tastes.*The next day, after several captives were worked to exhaustion belowdecks, theoar master herded them back up on deck with shouts and growls and crackingwhips. Bosko released Lila and Bannon from their manacles on deck and commandedthem to go down to the benches. A foul stench wafted around him, which even thesea breezes couldn’t dissipate.During the stifling heat of the afternoon, Bannon and Lila sat side by side asthey pulled on the oars. Lila was a friend and sometimes lover, but she hadnever been much for conversation. As they pulled on the oars, Lila stared withhatred at the Norukai captors, yet with a calculating gleam in her eyes.Chalk came down to jabber, fearful of Lila, but fascinated by her as well. In aclumsy whisper that was easily audible over the creaking oars, he muttered toBannon as if it were a secret, “Pretty lady. Dangerous lady.” His pale face wasmottled purple and yellow from where she had struck him. “No love for Chalk,though. Not me. I’ll never have love.”Lila growled, “Cut me loose and I’ll love you until I break you into tinypieces.” Chalk scuttled away with a last look at Bannon and retreated up thewooden ladder to the deck above.“Pull!” the oar master scolded.The serpent ships sailed north from the estuary for days. Grieve paced the deck,and Chalk followed him like a puppy. The king placed his iron-knuckled hand onthe shaman’s bony shoulder. “We’ll be at the Bastion soon.”“The Bastion,” Chalk cried. “Home!” He ran up to Bannon, leaned close, andrepeated, “Home!”Grieve’s expression darkened as he turned to his shaman. “I hoped Ildakar wouldbe the center of my new empire. What went wrong? What didn’t you foresee? Weshould have been victorious!”Chalk’s pale eyes gleamed with a cracked edge of madness. “There will be war, abig war! I promised a war. Many ships. My Grieve, King Grieve! They’ll allgrieve!”“Soon,” the king vowed.The serpent ships sailed onward. For Bannon and Lila, the days were an endlessblur of being chained on the open deck or sweating in the miserable hold as theyworked the oars. When the wind picked up and stretched the sails, the oars werewithdrawn, and the slaves remained bound with nothing to do but fear theirfates.One afternoon, the lookout called from the top of the mast. “Selka in the water!Starboard side.” Grieve strode to the bow, where he shaded his craggy brow andstared out on the waves.Bannon raised himself up so he could scan the water. “Do you see them?” he askedLila.“What are selka?”Squinting across the choppy water, he felt a thrill of terror as he spotted fiveswimming figures. “They look human, but they are definitely not human.”Lila’s brow furrowed. “Fish people?”“That’s as good a description as any. A race of humans long ago altered to liveunder the water. They can rip sharks apart with their claws.” He shivered evenunder the hot sun. “Nathan told me that during the great war thousands of yearsago, powerful wizards manipulated captives, gave them gills and changed theirskin in order to form an undersea army. The war is long over, and the selka havebuilt an entire civilization beneath the surface. They hate humans and theystill prey on ships.” He swallowed hard as the memories washed over him.“They attacked the Wavewalker when we were traveling south. The selka swarmedover our ship at night, killed the entire crew to get revenge against thewishpearl divers that raided their reefs. Nicci, Nathan, and I were the onlyones to survive when the Wavewalker wrecked on the Phantom Coast. The selkaqueen had some connection to me, didn’t want to kill me . . . for whatever thatwas worth. But they were unstoppable.”“The odds are better now. This time you have me to fight beside you,” Lila said.“And I am a morazeth.”With her hands bound and her ankles shackled, Bannon doubted even Lila could domuch against a selka attack.At the railings, the Norukai held their bone-tipped spears, ready to hurl themat the swimming figures, but the selka kept their distance. Grieve bellowed achallenge out on the water. “Come close enough for us to kill you!” The selkaremained tauntingly out of reach.Chalk groaned with fascination. “Selka fish! Fish people!” He nervously ran hispalms over the puckered, scarred skin of his stomach. “I don’t want to begutted, King Grieve, my Grieve.”The king glowered down at him. “I won’t let them gut you, Chalk.”The shaman chanted in a singsong voice, “Wrong, wrong, wrong!”As if bored, the selka swam away, while the Norukai doubled their lookouts tokeep watch on the water.Lost in his memories, Bannon mused quietly to Lila, “I don’t know why the selkaqueen spared me the first time.” When he was much younger, he had stolen a smallfishing boat and sailed away from Chiriya Island without charts or knowledge. Hedrifted for days until he ran out of water and food, sunburned, in despair. He’dbeen sure he would die at sea.“I knew stories of the selka,” he told Lila, “but I’d never seen one. I thoughtthey were just fisherman’s tales, but that night when a sea fog closed in, Ihuddled in my boat and fell asleep. In the darkness, something pulled my boat,brought me back to the island. When I woke, I was home, and the boat was draggedup on the rocky shore. I saw only the imprint of a webbed foot in the beach.” Helooked at her. “When they attacked the Wavewalker, the selka queen seemed torecognize me.”Lila gave him a skeptical look. “I believe you overestimate your charm andattractiveness, boy.” Her voice was flat, but he thought she was teasing him.“But if the queen wishes to be your lover, I will fight her.”He shuddered at the thought. “I don’t ever want to see her again.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 43 [part0003.html#a7]After Ava’s spirit ransacked the archives, Cliffwall went on high alert. GeneralZimmer dispatched scouts out of the canyons to monitor the oncoming army thatwas already marching out of the mountains. Nathan called an emergency meeting sothat everyone could discuss how they might possibly prepare against such anoverwhelming force.As he and Verna hurried toward the gathering chamber, the prelate said with hardskepticism, “I’m not confident we have any viable options. This archive is nolonger hidden, and Utros is on his way. How can we defend Cliffwall?”Nathan clucked his tongue. “I’m sure we’ll find something, my dear, if we justthink hard enough.”She walked ahead of him into the large gathering chamber. “You sound like anaive fool.”“I prefer the term ‘optimist.’ Remember, I’ve helped save the world before.” Buthe’d had the help of Nicci, and Richard, and others. Knowing that Nicci wasstill alive did not help him, because she wasn’t there. He had no idea where sheactually was, only that she had somehow killed the sorceress Ava.The prelate responded with only a roll of her eyes.Franklin and Gloria sat at a speakers’ table before the anxious audience. Zimmershifted uncomfortably in his seat; his D’Haran armor was clean and professional,as if he were reporting to Lord Rahl himself. Nathan and Verna took theremaining seats at the front table before the gathered crowd. Intent scholarsfilled the room, sitting on the available benches while others stoodshoulder-to-shoulder. The low buzz of conversation was not the casual talkusually heard at such meetings.Thorn and Lyesse stood with weapons at their sides. Eight Sisters of the Lightsat watching the prelate, confident and waiting to learn how they could help.Oliver and Peretta remained close to Amber.Gloria nodded to her memmers as the Cliffwall inhabitants asked questions of oneanother. Scholar-Archivist Franklin folded his hands in front of him, waitingfor the crowd to quiet down. Crowded at the entrance to the chamber, some of theungifted workers listened in, deeply worried.Nathan cleared his throat. “We don’t have time to waste, and someone needs tocall this meeting to order, although I believe meetings are often a waste oftime when action is required. The enemy army knows exactly where to find us. Ahundred thousand soldiers will take over this archive, unless we figure out away to stop them.”“How can we possibly stop that many?” cried one of the memmers.“By killing them,” Thorn interjected, as if the answer were obvious.Verna looked annoyed. “An excellent suggestion, but unhelpful. We have toprevent them from capturing all the knowledge stored here. They cannot have it!”“At the pace of their march, they are maybe four days away,” Zimmer said. “Butmy scouts suggest they have picked up speed.”A wave of anxious whispers rippled through the chamber.Lyesse said, “The soldiers are gaunt and hungry, and they are stripping thelandscape clean, devouring everything in sight.”“But they continue to march nevertheless,” Thorn added. “On our lastreconnaissance, we killed six of them.”“Each,” Lyesse added. “For good measure.”Captain Trevor spoke up, frustrated. “We cannot stop them one or two at a time.”“With the maze of narrow canyons, the sheer cliffs, the mesa rising above thevalley, Cliffwall is defensible,” Zimmer explained. “A small number of fighterscan hold the bottleneck at the mouth of the canyon. With the properpreparations, we could ambush the enemy, slay thousands as they funnel into thecanyon.”“Their piled bodies form another wall of defense,” Lyesse said, relishing thethought.“You are quite ambitious, General,” Nathan said, “but with so many thousands ofwarriors who refuse to give up, Utros will overwhelm us no matter what hislosses are. The soldiers will keep coming and keep coming. Given what his deadsorceress told him, he will want to possess the knowledge stored here, and he isnot a man to give up.”“We can still try to hold them off,” said the wizard Leo. “Can’t we?”“It remains an incredible risk,” Franklin pointed out. “We must evacuate as manypeople as possible, get them to safety. I won’t let all those innocent familiesjust huddle here waiting to be slaughtered. We have to accept that Cliffwall maybe captured. We could pack up some of the most important volumes and rush themin pack trains up into the highlands above the canyon.”“I concur,” said Gloria. “If my memmers go with them, at least they will takethe knowledge they carry in their minds, and that is the equivalent of thousandsof books.”“The knowledge in the archive is too dangerous,” Verna said. “We must not letthat information fall into enemy hands. We cannot!”“It took years and years to install all those works here,” Franklin said. “Evenif we took wagonloads of books above the canyon, we could only save a tinyfraction. It’s simply not possible! We haven’t even sorted them yet.”“We can’t move the archive,” Nathan said. “That much is obvious. Who wouldchoose the volumes to save? Even if we merely hid the most dangerous books incaves, then what? With limitless enemy soldiers to search the surrounding areas,Utros would find the books. And the spirit of his sorceress can flit anywhere.”“We don’t dare let General Utros have any of those books. The knowledge is toodangerous,” Verna insisted.“My memmers are meant to preserve information,” Gloria said, “but if they werecaptured and tortured . . .” She looked at her gifted followers in their bluerobes. “What might they be forced to reveal?”Groans of dismay went through the audience. The scholars began to talk heatedly.Zimmer rose to his feet, crossed his arms over his chest armor. “We have todefend Cliffwall. Evacuate all the civilians to safety, but my defenders muststop the army from breaking through into the canyon. We will stay here and useevery possible defense to block the invasion.”“Ava knows exactly what the archive contains,” Nathan said. “Her sister Ruva islikely still alive, too, unless Nicci killed her as well.” He stroked his chin.“She is just one sorceress,” Oron said.“And a hundred thousand soldiers,” Leo pointed out.“All the wizards of Ildakar could barely scratch that giant army,” Olgya said.“We have far fewer defenses here.”Zimmer placed his fists on the table in front of him. “Let us be realistic.”Black stubble shadowed his cheeks, and his forehead glistened with perspiration.“I have about fifty D’Haran soldiers as well as a few city guards from Ildakar.We have Oron and Leo, Olgya and Perri from Ildakar, along with Nathan, PrelateVerna and her Sisters of the Light, and some gifted Cliffwall scholars who canfight with magic.” He drew a deep breath. “Even with the natural defenses of thecanyons here, I doubt we could hold against General Utros and his army.”“But we will try,” Captain Trevor said. “We will fight to the last, and makethem pay a very high price!”“Yet they will still break through,” Verna interjected. “No matter how brave anddesperate our defense is, if we don’t hold that canyon opening, then all islost. If this archive falls into enemy hands, then all is lost!” Her voice roseas her anger intensified. “General Utros could use that dangerous information tocrush the Old World.” She placed a hand on Nathan’s sleeve as if to drawstrength. “The Sisters of the Light revere knowledge, and this is a hardconclusion for me, but I believe it’s the only one.” She stared around the room,her gaze finally resting on Gloria and Franklin. “If that army breaks through,we have to destroy Cliffwall.”Franklin gasped. “But we haven’t completed our work!”Gloria cried, “Still so many volumes to memorize.”“Utros will ransack it. He will find the same deadly spells we are searchingfor, and he’ll use that magic to destroy the world.”Nathan could feel the heart beating louder in his chest, and he grimaced as atwinge of dark pain shot through him again. “I remember when Richard broughtdown the Palace of the Prophets. Such a landmark, so much information in thosevaults.” He bit his lower lip. “But the world has survived fine without thatknowledge. While I appreciate General Zimmer’s confidence and bravado, Vernapointed out to me that misplaced optimism is only a fool’s weapon.”“But think of all the sacrifices that went into creating Cliffwall!” Gloriagroaned.Peretta spoke up. “Cliffwall’s magic belongs to humanity, to someone who knowshow to use it.”“For good, not evil,” Nathan said. “We have to face facts. This archive remainedsafe behind its camouflage shroud for three thousand years, and no one used anyof the magic for good or ill. Our civilization bumbled along nevertheless. Theworld went on.” He tapped his fingernails on the wooden table surface. “Veryshortly after the archive was opened again, though, Roland the Lifedrinkerabused a spell and made himself into an insatiable monster, as did Victoriaafter him. Better that the magic had never been discovered at all. We would havebeen safer.”Gloria looked away, embarrassed at the mention of her mentor. The other memmersalso muttered.Verna picked up the discussion in a hard voice. “And then there was the studentElbert, who melted the prophecy archive by unleashing the Weeping Stone spell,which he couldn’t control. And those were merely accidents! Think how much worseit will be if Utros intentionally uses that lore to destroy anyone who opposeshim.”Zimmer was impatient. “We should still try to defend the canyon. My men areready. We can make plans, set traps, kill countless numbers of the enemy. Wewill never have a better opportunity.” He swallowed. “But if we fail, if GeneralUtros overruns the canyon, can we find a way to destroy the archive? Only then,not before?”Olgya said, “How will we do that? Burn all the books? Seal the tunnels? Howcould we do it fast enough if the enemy army has already broken through?”Verna had a distant look on her face, and Nathan frowned at her. “What are youthinking, my dear?”“The Weeping Stone spell. Maybe we just need to use it on a larger scale.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44 [part0003.html#a7]After leaving the damaged sliph temple, Nicci made her way to Serrimundi Harbor,where the aftermath of the Norukai raid was still apparent. At the mouth of thesheltered harbor, a high rock outcropping protected the entrance with a hugecarving of the Sea Mother. Sunken ships with splintered masts rose from thewater like grasping hands. Several docks were shattered, pilings uprooted andcollapsed.The harbor was an obstacle course of scuttled cargo vessels, fishing boats, anddestroyed serpent ships that had held murderous Norukai. Fishermen, foreignsailors, Serrimundi seamen, and dockworkers all labored together to help thecity recover.Out in the water, some ships had burned to the waterline, and others listed toone side, taking on water. Like flesh beetles stripping the meat off a corpseand leaving only bones, harbor workers crawled over a sunken ship that blockedthe main docks. They used saws, pry bars, and mallets to dismantle the wreck,stripping it down to its ribs and keel.“Tie this rope around the lowest rib under the waterline,” shouted abare-chested man with a deeply tanned bald pate and a voluminous black beard. Hestood at the end of the dock and threw a coil of rope into the water. “We’ll riga winch on the shore to drag that damned serpent ship out of the main channel.”In the water, four muscular young men took the rope and swam toward ahalf-sunken serpent ship just beyond the pier. Nicci recognized the swimmers asarrogant wishpearl divers, surprised to see them pitching in. The divers swamout to the wreck and plunged deep, pulling the rope along with them.Men rowing small dinghies towed floating debris to a stony beach at the far endof the harbor, where more people pulled wreckage out of the water. They stackedsalvageable planks and logs above the tide line and burned other debris in alarge garbage fire.Despite Serrimundi’s ambitious recovery, Nicci was sure the Norukai would strikehere again. She had originally come to warn them about General Utros’s army, butinstead she had faced the bloodthirsty raiders. Before she’d killed Captain Kor,he had boasted that the Norukai were also attacking Ildakar.Yes, Nicci had plenty of enemies to fight.She came upon a merchant dressed in unseasonably warm clothes, a dark woolenjacket and a vest buttoned across his ample belly. He worked alone in front ofan open warehouse near a stack of scorched wooden crates. With a pry bar hecracked open the lids to inspect the contents.Nicci stopped in front of him. “Tell me where to find Harborlord Otto.”The merchant sweated profusely in his stifling clothes. “I’m ruined. I’ve losthalf of my goods.”“At least you didn’t lose your life.”He blew air through his lips, grudgingly accepting her statement. “Theharborlord is tallying the damaged ships.” He gestured toward one of the maindocks. “Look for him aboard the Mist Maiden.”Nicci knew the ship. That was where she had fought the Norukai and killed Kor.As she walked off, the merchant pulled green and blue silks out of a crate,frowning at the blood that had soaked into the contents. “Ruined, just ruined.”It didn’t take her long to find the three-masted cargo ship. Crews continued toscrub the bloodstains from the deck of the Mist Maiden. One man hung on a highyardarm like a spider restringing the rigging.She called out as she approached. “Harborlord!”Sailors came to the rail to stare down at her. Some cheered. “It’s Nicci. We’resafe again!”“You’re not safe until you learn how to fight for yourselves,” she replied.Without being invited, she walked up the gangplank to the deck where HarborlordOtto sat on a barrel next to the Mist Maiden’s Captain Ganley, who was betrothedto Otto’s daughter.The harborlord looked at Nicci from beneath a floppy hat. His caramel-coloredeyes were heavy with the sight of too much death and blood. “Nicci! I thoughtyou went back to Ildakar.”“I tried to. How long have I been gone?”Otto scratched his beard, considering. “The Norukai attacked ten days ago.” Helet out a long sigh. “Without you, my sweet Shira and her children would havebeen killed. I would have been killed. But you made us stand strong. Serrimundiwill never forget that.”Captain Ganley stepped toward her with a relieved grin as if he meant to hugher, but he hesitated when he saw the razor edge of her demeanor. “There is somuch wreckage, it’ll take a year before the city is back to what it was.”“If the Norukai don’t attack again,” Nicci said, and both men turned pale. “Andthere is also the army of General Utros to contend with. This is no time to becomplacent.”“Will it really be that bad?” Otto asked. “Serrimundi has prospered forcenturies. We kept our independence even under the Imperial Order.”“This is different,” Nicci said. “Utros is intent on conquering the Old World,and the Norukai are wild animals. They want to raid and pillage, not engage inpeaceful trade.”At the harbor mouth, a lookout on the high promontory of rock banged on a brassgong, and a signal fire took hold, sending pale smoke curling into the air. Ottoshaded his eyes. “There’s a ship coming in.”Tension thickened like a thunderstorm in the air. People gathered along thedocks, looking to the mouth of the harbor and the giant Sea Mother, afraid itmight be more Norukai serpent ships.Ganley swallowed hard. “We are not ready to fight again so soon.”When the lookout banged twice more on the gong, Otto visibly relaxed. Nicciwaited for a report. “What does it mean?”“We know it’s not a warship,” Otto said. “That wasn’t a call to arms.”A low vessel with patched gray sails slipped past the giant cliff carving. Thehull was dark and dirty, but it seemed to be a swift ship, judging from howeasily it sailed into the harbor.“A kraken hunter,” Ganley said with distaste.“Not just any krakener,” Otto said. “That is the Chaser, my brother Jared’sship.”As the dingy ship nimbly dodged the sunken wrecks and protruding masts in theharbor, Nicci admired the captain’s skill. Captain Jared seemed to know everysail, every rigging rope, and every vagary of the winds and currents. He steeredand dodged with little room to spare. People crowded the Chaser’s deck, hundredsof bedraggled men and women, even children, packed together. Loaded with so manypassengers, the krakener rode precariously low in the water, but the captaindeftly guided the vessel to the nearest open slip. At the bow stood a man withdark hair, a gap between his front teeth, and eyes and nose similar to Otto’s.Nicci followed the harborlord to where the Chaser was tying up. Three narrowplanks were thrown down from the krakener to the dock, and the refugees began todisembark, jostling one another in their eagerness to get back on dry land. Acrying girl clutched her mother’s hand, and the mother’s head had angry redscabs from severe wounds. The people flowed off the Chaser and milled around thepier, disoriented and lost. Some dropped to their knees, praising the SeaMother. Many had bloodstained bandages, splints, slings, or obvious bruises.Nicci and Otto moved among the jabbering refugees, asking questions. Thebedraggled people looked shocked and lost. “The Norukai destroyed Effren,” saidone man with a prominent black eye. “Our city is burned to the ground. Hundredstaken captive, our women raped.”An old woman beside him groaned. “Ten serpent ships came at night, led by a mannamed Lars.”“The Norukai never attacked Effren before. They don’t come this far north,” theman said. “Some of us hid in our root cellars. Others ran into the hills. Thosewho stayed to fight—” He swallowed hard and couldn’t find the words.The old woman finished for him. “Those who fought back were all slain.”Nicci felt a flash of anger. “I killed Captain Kor, but I remember Lars too.They came to Ildakar with a load of slaves.”The refugees seemed in a hurry, though they had no place to go. Nicci and theharborlord wove their way through the milling crowd to reach the krakener. Niccicaught a foul whiff as soon as she approached. The Chaser’s hull and deck wereimpregnated with oil and long-hardened slime. She remembered kraken hunters fromher time in Tanimura with the Sisters, where the ships would come in with loadsof smelly kraken meat, oil, and leather.After all the refugees had disembarked, Captain Jared hopped down from theraised bow and came toward them. “Brother, it looks like Serrimundi has had someexcitement since I’ve been away.”“The Norukai attacked,” Otto said. “We defeated them, but not without sufferinggreat damage.”“You are better off than Effren, I guarantee you that,” Jared said, and hisexpression darkened. “The Norukai left nothing but wreckage and bodies. When theChaser arrived, I loaded as many survivors as I could and brought them here tosanctuary in Serrimundi, though some of them stayed behind to pick through therubble.”Otto looked at all the people streaming aimlessly down the docks with no placeto go. “These refugees can earn their food and keep by helping us rebuild, butwith the harbor damaged and the traders skittish, we won’t have many suppliescoming in to feed the extra mouths.”“Nevertheless, you will make do,” Nicci said, allowing no argument. “Thosepeople are all potential fighters who could fend off another Norukai attack orstand against the army of General Utros. You need them.”Jared flashed her a bright smile, revealing the gap in his front teeth. “And whois this?” Even after the harshness he’d experienced and all the miserablerefugees that had crowded aboard his ship, the captain seemed to have inordinategood cheer.“I am the one who warned Serrimundi to build up their defenses, although alittle too late.” She kept her voice neutral, taking no satisfaction in beingproved right. She was curious to hear accurate and recent information. “IfCaptain Lars attacked Effren, that means more than one Norukai raiding party isattacking the coast. More ships may well strike Serrimundi and other cities.”Jared gave a grim nod. “The Effren survivors say there’s been no word fromLarrikan Shores for several days, and that’s farther south. I expect we’ll findthat city in ruins as well.”Nicci already knew that General Utros’s great army was on the move, and now theNorukai threat had grown more severe. She turned to the harborlord. “I need togo north to Tanimura and the D’Haran garrison there. The Old World must uniteagainst this common threat.” When Otto looked at her blankly, not reacting asquickly as she wished, she snapped, “I need a fast horse so I can ride up thecoastal road to Tanimura. I want to depart within the hour.”Jared scoffed. “Why would you want to ride a smelly horse? You’ll be saddle soreand covered with dust before you get there many days from now.” He gesturedtoward the gray, patched sails of the Chaser and spoke with a heartfelt pride asif he were praising a beautiful woman. “My Chaser is ten times faster than ahorse, if we have fair winds.”Nicci realized that sailing was indeed a faster option. “With my gift, I canguarantee fair winds.”Jared laughed. “A sorceress aboard my ship. It’ll be a refreshing change.”“There’s very little refreshing about a krakener,” Otto said with a grimace.“But that is your best choice, Nicci, if you can stand the smell.”She thought of all the miserable experiences she had endured in her life. “I canstand a bad smell.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 45 [part0003.html#a7]Out on the open sea, the Norukai grew restless, boisterous. They pounded ontheir shields and stomped on the deck, as if their raid on Ildakar had somehowbeen a victory instead of a defeat. As the sun set, they began chanting,“Serpent god! Serpent god needs blood.”Chalk waved his hands in the air. “Serpent god will save us, but serpent god ishungry.” He ran to cling to King Grieve. “Serpent god needs blood, my king, myGrieve.”The king frowned down at him. “You’re sure the serpent god will save us? You’veseen it in a vision?”“Serpent god will save some of us.” Chalk cackled. “But I won’t tell which ones!A secret.”King Grieve scanned the huddling slaves chained to the deck, and his eyes lit onthe weakest, most exhausted captive. “Take that one. We’ll whet the serpentgod’s appetite.”The slave wailed and struggled while the others crouched against the sideboards,as if they could become invisible. Bannon pulled on his chain, straining tobreak free, though he had no idea how he could help the poor man. Lila glareddaggers at the king, straining against her bonds until her wrists bled.For good measure, Grieve cuffed Bannon on the side of the head, then ignoredhim. The scrawny, doomed slave struggled, but to no avail. He was shirtless, andhis sunburned back was blistered and peeling. Ages ago, it seemed, the man hadbeen a minor noble from Ildakar.The raiders went to the side of the ship and hammered on the wood with theirspear shafts, their war mallets, and the hilts of their swords in a resoundingcall to some monster beneath the surface.“Serpent god is deep,” Chalk cried. “But serpent god is hungry! Serpent god willsave us.” He suddenly whimpered and cringed. “But not all of us.”The Norukai performed no ceremony. Grieve simply dragged the captive to the railand leaned him out over the water. With a vicious slash, he drew his daggeracross the man’s throat, cutting deep. The victim’s blood fountained out, andGrieve dangled him by the waist of his pants over the waves so the blood randown the hull and into the sea.The Norukai kept pounding on the deck in anticipation, while the captivesgroaned in terror.“Serpent god is deep,” Chalk said, “but he will eat.”When the blood had drained, Grieve heaved the body overboard into the waves. Thedead man drifted behind the three ships and slowly sank, but no serpent godappeared, even though they waited in tense silence for many minutes. The Norukaigrumbled with disappointment.Bannon felt sick anger for the loss of one of his comrades, and Lila seethed insilence as she watched the sacrifice. Surreptitiously, she kept working,twisting, scraping her hands against the ropes, but even if she freed herwrists, the chain still anchored her to the deck.*The serpent ships sailed on during the night while the Norukai navigated by thestars. Bannon lay bound under the dim lantern light, unable to sleep. Lila laylike a coiled spring ready to be released, and her mere presence offered himsome comfort. The dark sails were invisible against the night sky except forwhere they blocked out the stars. He listened to the stirring waves thatcaressed the hull.Chalk curled up on the deck and slept, then woke up and scuttled to a newresting place, where he slept again. He seemed nervous.Bannon knew that even if he and Lila managed to break free, they had nowhere togo. They were in the middle of the ocean and would never survive long enough toreach land. He lay on deck grinding his teeth. Lila was so silent he couldn’ttell whether she was asleep or awake. His pulse ticked off the seconds of hiscaptivity, appreciating every moment he remained alive. Once the serpent shipsreached the Norukai islands, though, the situation would be even worse.As he listened to the breeze, the creaking canvas and wood, the whisper of wavesand the snores of the Norukai, he heard a different sound, a wet scuffling, asof something slithering up the hull. Next to him, Lila became instantly alert.She twisted herself upright and strained against the ropes around her wrists.Bannon felt an icy trickle of terror when he saw a shadow appear at the rail,slip over, and drop to the deck. Another silhouette followed a moment later.Sudden shouts of alarm erupted from the two nearby ships. From their decks heheard the ring of steel and hard blows, the clamor of fighting. Bannon lurchedto his feet and tugged on his chain. Lila stood close to him like a corneredguard dog.The Norukai roused themselves and grabbed their weapons, ready for battle.Bannon saw a third scaly figure climb over the side and land on the deck, movingas swiftly as a flash of minnows darting away in a stream. Five other creaturesappeared, their bodies glistening with water and slime. They had large eyes andwide mouths full of needle-sharp teeth, and gill slits like wet wounds alongtheir necks. Their webbed hands were tipped with powerful claws.“Selka . . .” Bannon’s stomach twisted, and then he yelled at the top of hislungs, “The selka!” The chain burned his ankle, and he wrestled with the ropeson his wrists. He snapped at the scrambling Norukai. “Free us! I don’t want todie here like a gutted fish. Let me at least fight them!” He knew what the selkawould do.Lila grimaced as she twisted her wrists and more blood flowed down her forearms.“I won’t let them kill you, boy, at least not without a fight.”Roused, the raiders grabbed battle-axes, war hammers, and curved swords as theselka swarmed the ship. The sea people were greenish gray, but their fins hadsplashes of color, some with jagged stripes, others with a tinge of blue. Theyflung themselves in among the Norukai, slashing with claws, ripping open broadchests.One selka grasped a Norukai woman’s forearm and bit down viciously. The fangscrunched through the skin and bone, severing the hand so that the woman’s swordclattered to the deck. As if she didn’t even feel the pain, the Norukai swungback her arm and punched the bloody stump into the selka’s face, gouging out itsslitted eye with the jagged end of bone.Three at a time, the selka fell upon individual raiders and ripped them topieces, slashing out throats, yanking off scarred jaws, cracking open chests tofeed on red quivering hearts. But the Norukai killed many selka as well. KingGrieve swung his war axe, decapitating two creatures in a single stroke. Thewide mouths gaped on the rolling heads like fish drying under the sun.Chalk darted about the deck, a pale scarecrow in the starlight. He flailed hishands. “Fish people. Fish people! I don’t want to be eaten by fish!”With a sweep of his massive arm, Grieve pushed the shaman back toward the waterbarrels near the bow. “Protect yourself, Chalk. Stay behind me.”The slaves ducked into shelter wherever they could find it, rattling theirchains, desperate to get free. Bannon yanked his leg, and the anchor boltwobbled in the wood, but he couldn’t pull the leg iron loose.One female selka looked more majestic than the others, with a spatter of leopardspots on her golden-green scales. She flashed her bright gaze across the Norukaias if a banquet had just been served. Bannon recognized the selka queen.A Norukai warrior ran toward her, swinging a spiked mace, but the queen hooked asharp claw under his chin like a fisherman snagging a carp. She lifted himbodily off the deck and flung him overboard as if she were discarding garbage.Closer to Bannon and Lila, one brawny male selka stalked up to the captives,extending claws in his webbed hands. Seeing them bound and struggling, the selkaclosed in to kill them.With a cry of effort, Lila at last freed her wrists and flung the rope away. Asthe male selka prowled closer, she seized the chain at her ankle and hauled withall her might. The bolt came free of the deck with a splintering crack. Sheuprooted the chain just as the selka charged at them, and that was all theweapon she needed. She swung the rattling links to smash the sharp bolted endinto the creature’s face. He clapped webbed hands against his mangled mouth,snarling and burbling. Lila whipped the chain again into the side of his head,crushing his temple. The selka fell in a pool of slime and blood at her feet.Glancing around, she dropped to her knees next to Bannon. Lila worked at thebindings at his wrists, clawing the thick knot until her fingernails werebloody, and finally the rope came free. He flexed his arms, ready to use hisfists if nothing else, but the anchor bolt still held his chain to the deck.Three more selka approached, snarling and ready to kill Lila to avenge the selkashe had just slain. Bannon jerked against the bolt, ignoring the rush of painthat raced through his ankle and up his leg. The heavy pin began to wobbleloose.With the selka closing in on her, Lila spun, holding her own chain to defendBannon. He tugged at the loose links, rocking the bolt, feeling the woodsplinter. “Almost . . . almost!”As Lila swung the chain back and forth, the bolt whistled through the air andthe selka recoiled. With a mighty heave, Bannon finally uprooted his chain, andhe was so surprised that he stumbled to his knees.Now the selka turned to him as well.Unexpectedly, the selka queen glided closer, sleek and strangely beautiful. Shelet out a scolding hiss and snapped orders to her followers. “Not this one.” Shefixed her golden eyes on Bannon and insisted, “Not this one.” She extended oneclawed forefinger toward him and added, “I remember.”The three selka warriors cowered, backing away, while the queen bounded towardthe Norukai. The rest of the selka left the bound slaves alone, satisfied withmany other victims to kill.King Grieve roared as he hacked at the attackers with his war axe. He continuedto fight, drenched with blood and slime. Dead sea people lay all around thedeck. Chalk huddled among the barrels and crates near the front of the serpentship. “My Grieve, King Grieve! I will grieve!”Gnashing her teeth, clacking her jaws, a Norukai woman bounded forward tointercept the queen. “I will gut you, bitch!” She strode past the slaves as ifthey didn’t exist at all.Bannon lashed out with his uprooted chain, caught the Norukai woman around herthick leg, and drove her to the deck. She writhed in astonishment and lunged forBannon, but he swung the chain and caught her on the side of the head, caving inher skull. She grunted, then wilted to the deck as blood leaked from her earsand mouth.The selka queen saw what he had done and let out a hiss that might have beenappreciation. Lila also noticed. “Don’t flirt with her, boy.”The selka queen chose the brawny Norukai king as her next target. She prowledforward with feral beauty, as graceful as death. When Grieve saw her, he alsorecognized his main opponent. With a heavy swing, he buried his axe in the chestof a nearby selka. The curved blade dug deep, cracked bone, and Grieve pressedhis boot on the creature’s chest to rip his weapon free.He faced the queen. Four selka warriors flanked her, pressing closer, and Grievemade his stand near the confined wedge of the bow. The serpent god figureheadstared out into the darkness.All along the deck, selka and Norukai fought and killed and died, turning thescrubbed boards into a bloody quagmire. Grieve snapped his scarred jaws andglared at the selka queen. She, in turn, splayed a webbed handful of claws, andcrouched, unafraid of his great axe. All of the selka prepared to spring at thesame time, and they would tear the king apart. Grieve cocked back his massivearm to fight to the death.Suddenly, a pale figure streaked between them. Chalk yelled, waving his hands.Tears streaked his white face. “No, no! You can’t have my Grieve. My king!” Hethrew himself in front of the selka queen, unarmed, defenseless.With a quick slash, she hooked her claws into Chalk’s abdomen below the navel,then in a flash tugged brutally upward, laying him open from his groin to hisbreastbone like a gutted fish. Chalk’s entrails and organs slithered out of thewide wound, and he dropped to his knobby knees, gurgling, “My Grieve . . .”The Norukai king’s scarred mouth dropped open in utter disbelief. “Chalk!”Bannon felt sickened and horrified. He loathed the scarred albino, but evenso . . .With a second gesture, the selka queen ripped out Chalk’s throat, and she hurledhim to the deck like a bloody white rag.“No!” The word was ripped from Grieve’s throat and heart as if his entireuniverse had just ended. “Nooo!”In a mindless blood rage, he lunged forward, and the surviving Norukai joinedhim, redoubling their efforts to fight."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 46 [part0003.html#a7]There is no more time,” Zimmer announced, and everyone in Cliffwall knew he wasright. More D’Haran scouts had returned with the expected news that the marchingarmy was already crossing the fertile valley and leaving devastation in theirwake.“No doubt about it, sir,” said the dust-covered young man who ran up to issuehis report. “General Utros is heading straight for these canyons.” He wipedsweat from his forehead. “They intend to take Cliffwall.”“Ava told them exactly where to find us,” Verna said, her nostrils flaring.Nathan had gone without sleep since the first emergency meeting, and hesuspected it would be a long time before he got a good night’s rest again. Heturned to Verna. “It’s time to evacuate the families and scholars to safety,while some of us remain to make a last stand. With our layers of new defenses,maybe we can save Cliffwall.”Throughout the sheltered canyon, the ungifted workers had packed whateverpossessions they could carry. Many complained at having to abandon everythingthey had worked so hard to create.“We can’t just leave it all behind,” said one shepherd trying to chase his flockto the end of the box canyon, where steep paths wound upward to the highplateau.Nathan shook his head. “Save your family. You will have to rebuild, but youcan’t rebuild if you’re not alive.” The shepherd stubbornly kept chasing hissheep.Nathan walked along, touching the ornate sword at his hip. From the Cliffwallstores he had found new garments, acquiring a deep blue vest that matched theazure of his eyes. He even found a fine traveling cape that he thought matchedhis demeanor as an adventurer.Men and women climbed down the stone steps or wooden ladders from the cliffalcoves, moving with a sense of urgency and sadness. Parents led their childrenup the canyon to the winding paths by which they could reach the highlands.Thorn and Lyesse accompanied them as watchful guardians.The D’Haran soldiers drilled constantly and developed pragmatic ways to hold thebottleneck opening to the canyon. General Zimmer and the wizards were stillconfident they could stop the enemy. Trenchers dug pits, erected spikedbarricades, and laid down numerous hidden traps. Soldiers scaled the cliffs andset up caches of stones that they could hurl down on the ancient army fromabove.Ava’s spirit was seen, flitting into the canyon, spying on them, but Olgya hadworked with countless gifted apprentices, teaching them distortion spells,masking spells, even raising fog banks to confuse the surveillance of the evilspirit.Perri, the gifted shaper, followed some of the agile soldiers up the cliff abovethe bottleneck opening, and she manipulated the stone to form perfect handholdsand footholds. Ten D’Haran soldiers stationed themselves in hiding places for anambush from high above, each man carrying a bow and a basket of arrows. Theywould rain down deadly projectiles as soon as the invaders approached the sheercliffs that blocked the entrance. Oron, Olgya, and Leo discussed ways in whichthey could use their magic to fight back.As she and Nathan watched the preparations, the prelate drew her mouth into atight frown. “If your handful of defenders can keep the canyon safe, then I willbe relieved.” She sighed. “And completely surprised. If you should fail, Nathan,I am fully prepared to bring down the cliffs and obliterate this dangerouslibrary. I have studied how to use the Weeping Stone spell. That will seal offthe entire archive to make sure the knowledge never, ever falls into enemyhands.”He shuddered at the metal in her gaze. “Be very careful, my dear prelate. We’veseen how powerful magic can burn like a wildfire out of control.”She gave him a skeptical frown. “You mean Elbert and the ruined prophecybuilding? We saw what happened when an untrained novice got out of his depth. Ihave a bit more experience than that.” Verna softened her expression, reachedout to touch Nathan’s shoulder. “But yes, I will be careful.”They climbed the narrow stone path to the large primary archive. Inside thebuildings and tunnels, scholars were frantically sorting the most importantdocuments, while memmers opened the chosen volumes and scanned them, impressingmore and more words upon their memories.Franklin could not decide which volumes to salvage, because there were so many.“We have to leave soon, but what am I to do? We have only cataloged a fractionof the books. How do we even know which are the best ones?” He ran both handsthrough his brown hair. “When Simon was killed, I became the scholar-archivist,but I never knew I would face a decision like this. Historical chronicles willrecord my name as the man who let Cliffwall be destroyed. What was it all for?”“We’re doing it to save the world,” Verna said. “It is not a useless gesture.”Nathan forced a bright tone in his words. “If we can deflect that gigantic army,then we won’t have to destroy the archive, and all the people can return home toa happy celebration.”Prelate Verna snorted. She joined the eight Sisters of the Light who pored overthe segregated books of dangerous magic, hoping to learn new spells they coulduse to attack General Utros. They had already discovered several techniques theywanted to try, but time was running out.Young Amber looked flushed and overwhelmed. She stared at several books spreadout in front of her, but couldn’t decide which one to read first. “Now I knowwhat my brother felt when his commander left him behind to defend Renda Bay. Heonly had fifty soldiers, too.”“He had more than that, my dear,” Nathan said, trying to calm her. “He hadingenuity, and the people of Renda Bay were motivated to fight back against theNorukai. We’re also fighting back.” He wrapped his new cape around hisshoulders, feeling the fine fabric. “Admittedly, Utros’s army is a lot largerthan any raid the Norukai ever sent against Renda Bay. . . .”Amber nodded. “If Norcross could do it, then so can I. I miss my brother. Do youthink we’ll ever see him again?”Nathan gave her a reassuring smile. “Of course we will.”“Provided we survive the next two days,” Verna corrected.“Always the pessimist.” Nathan sniffed.She was not amused. “As I’ve said many times before, I am a realist. For today,our main effort is to ensure that all of these people get to safety. Only thefighters—the soldiers and the gifted—shall remain behind.”“We will make our best defense,” Nathan said. “Do you need to study your WeepingStone spell, or are you confident you have every aspect memorized?”“I am confident, and I have the sorcerer’s sand,” Verna said. “If your defensesdo fail, then—and only then—I will use the spell to bring down the cliffside.”She gave him a hard smile. “I promise I will wait until the last moment, but ifI do need to trigger the spell, I’ll also be sure to wipe out as many of thosesoldiers as I can.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 47 [part0003.html#a7]The selka queen tore Chalk apart and discarded his body in a puddle of hisinternal organs.King Grieve went berserk.He became a glassy-eyed, rage-filled monster. He roared without words, a primalsound that would have made wolves shudder. Grieve swung his war axe in one handand yanked out his gutting knife with the other. In one blow he cleaved the headof the nearest selka, and the queen sprang back like a graceful fish, splayingclaws still dripping with Chalk’s blood. Her long hiss might have been tauntinglaughter.She landed nimbly on soft webbed feet out of the weapon’s reach. Grieve chargedat her like a mad bull, practically hurling the axe from side to side, but shedodged and slipped out of the way.Bannon sometimes slipped into a red haze on the battlefield, which turned himinto a fighting machine, a whirlwind of strength and sword. Afterward, he had nomemory of what he had done, but when he did come back to himself he would seethe bodies of his numerous victims, and he would be alive, although batteredwith a hundred injuries that he couldn’t recall.Now Grieve was in the same kind of frenzy.Three selka closed in on the king to take him down, but in a fury he chopped offtheir limbs or heads. Grieve flung his gutting knife directly at the queen, butshe bent backward in a flash. The blade slipped past, barely nicking her scaledchest, and embedded itself in the broad back of a Norukai who was fightinganother selka. The Norukai reached behind him, pawed at the dagger as ifwondering how it could possibly have appeared there, and his selka opponent usedthe opportunity to tear out his throat.Amid the shouts, screams, and clashing swords on the deck of the Norukai ship,Bannon now stood free, his wrists unbound and the leg-iron chain loose aroundhis ankle. He was ready to fight to the death, knowing he would likely notsurvive this massacre.Lila barely took a moment to catch her breath. Eager to fight, she snatched acurved sword from a severed arm on the deck, wrenching it free from clenchedfingers. She kicked the flopping limb away and raised the blade. She snapped atBannon, “Arm yourself, boy! Even if the selka queen doesn’t want to kill you,the Norukai do.”With the chain scraping behind him on the deck boards, Bannon ran to anotherdead raider in a pool of blood and relieved him of his sword. He swung theweapon to get the feel of it. “It’s not Sturdy, but it’ll do.” He liked theweight of this steel in his hand, heard the swish of its edge cutting throughthe air.Two hissing selka approached, ready to kill, but upon recognizing Bannon, theyslunk away to attack different targets.The other slaves whimpered, still tied to the deck and helpless. He made up hismind. “This isn’t our fight, Lila. Let the selka and Norukai slay each other.Guard me while I set the captives free so they can fight.”She took up her position by the slaves, holding her sword ready to fight anyenemy who came at them. Bannon bent down and used his blade to cut their wristsfree. Lila handed the slaves stout knives she had retrieved from dead Norukai onthe deck. “Use these to dig out the bolts. Chop at the wood if you need to.”King Grieve’s jaw dropped open with a roar, and his tongue flapped about like aflag of meat. “Chalk! Chalk was my protector.” Even though the selka queendodged among other fighters, Grieve closed in on her and raised his axe to hackdown. “Chalk was my friend!” She dipped and dodged, and the axe blade onlysliced her shoulder. The spotted frill on her head and back flared up like a sawblade, and blood oozed across her scaled skin.He cornered the selka queen against the side of the serpent ship, but ratherthan let herself be trapped, she leaped over the side in a graceful arc downinto the sea below, where the waves swallowed her. When the queen escaped,Grieve bellowed at the sky in a voice loud enough to crack the vault of heaven.The sounds of fighting resonated from the other two ships nearby. Bannon knewthat those slaves did not have his protection. As he swept his gaze across thedeck, he guessed that at least fifty selka already lay dead, and many morehacked bodies had gone overboard along with Norukai victims. In the dark waterbelow, countless selka swarmed in the waves. They feasted on the floatingNorukai bodies, while others closed around the serpent ships and swarmed up thehull boards.On the bloody deck, Lila turned from side to side, holding up her sword. Herface was drawn, not at all afraid, and Bannon thought she looked beautiful.Violence brought out the true nature of the morazeth. He said to her in a quiet,hoarse voice, “I’m glad you’re here.”Several selka threw themselves upon Gara the shipwright, clawing at her ropygray braids. She punched one with her massive fist, stabbed another with hersword, but two other creatures chomped on her shoulder and side, fastening theirneedle teeth like a vise. Gara kept fighting as they tore hunks of flesh fromher body. She staggered backward over the rail, and all three fell into thewater below, where more selka closed around them and stripped Gara to the bones.The bloody water looked like dark wine in the night.Unexpectedly, the sea people began to thrash in terror. Their loud hissingbecame a frantic splashing. From the waves, the selka queen let out a gratingcry of challenge.Something huge moved beneath the surface, a shadow in the dark water. It curvedfrom below, and a long jagged fin broke the surface between the two laggingserpent ships. It glided like a serrated blade through the swarming selka. Somedarted away, and flashes of scaled bodies disappeared below.“Sweet Sea Mother!” Bannon said.A huge frilled serpent head rose up, snapping its jaws, blasting out water andsteam. The sea serpent towered as high as the masts of the Norukai ships. Itsgills flared, its spiny fins flashed. It let out a thunderous bellow, darteddown like reptilian lightning, and snatched up four of the selka in the water.“Serpent god!” The Norukai began to cheer. “Serpent god!”On deck, the raiders redoubled their fighting with a sudden surge of enthusiasm,and the selka retreated in primal terror as the monster loomed above them.Bannon thought that all the spilled blood and froth in the water must have drawnthe underwater predator. Or was the blood sacrifice of the slave at sunsetresponsible?The serpent god thrashed after its prey like a fox in a henhouse, boilingthrough the selka. On deck, the raiders drove back the remaining sea people,hacking them to pieces with wild abandon. The selka could not escape by divingoverboard, where the serpent god would devour them. The desperate creatureskilled a few more Norukai before the last of them lay slain on the deck. In thesea, the other selka had scattered and streaked away in all directions, fleeingthe outraged serpent god.Still filled with their battle frenzy, the Norukai heaved selka bodiesoverboard, and the sea serpent feasted. The Norukai believed that their peoplewere also part of the serpent god, and they shared their blood with theserpent’s blood. Without ceremony, they picked up their own dead and cast theminto the waves to be devoured as well.At the bow of the ship, near the carved figurehead, King Grieve ignored thevictory. He dropped to his knees and picked up the gutted body of Chalk, holdingthe albino man against him as he sobbed, rocking back and forth. The bloodsmeared his muscular chest. “My Chalk, my friend!”Whispering, the Norukai backed away in awe as the huge sea serpent rose abovethe bow, its giant head dripping water and blood. Its huge eyes fixed down onKing Grieve, and the monster dropped open its jaws to show swordlike fangsinterspersed with scraps of flesh from the bodies it had just eaten. Recognizingthe king’s despair, it made a clear offer.Grieve clutched the dead shaman to his chest, torn with indecision. He looked upand met the eyes of the serpent god, then slowly nodded. “He is yours. Chalk isa part of you. Chalk is a part of us.”He gently laid the dead albino on the deck and stepped away. The serpent godbowed its flexible neck and dipped down to snatch Chalk’s body in its jaws, asif in reverence. With a graceful motion, the serpent tossed the broken body inthe air, caught it in a yawning mouth, and swallowed the albino whole.After a long moment, during which the serpent lorded over the three Norukaiships, the huge monster dropped beneath the waves and glided away, deep underthe surface.The night held a collective sigh of relief as the Norukai counted their dead andtended their wounds. Down in the water where many bodies floated, sharksappeared, drawn by the blood to clean up the remains, now that the serpent godhad departed.Bannon and Lila still gripped their swords among the other captives, ready todefend themselves. The slaves huddled, numb with terror, though some were readyto fight with confiscated weapons. They clearly had no chance, however. AsBannon and Lila watched, the Norukai closed in on them, battered and in no moodfor further resistance. King Grieve pushed the other raiders aside and gloweredat Bannon and Lila. Something inside Grieve seemed to have broken. His facetwisted as he spoke to Bannon. “Chalk liked you.”“I don’t know why,” Bannon said. “He told me about visions, but not what hesaw.”Wrestling with his agony, Grieve squeezed the handle of his war axe. Bannonlooked at Lila and knew she was calculating whether they would let themselves becaptured again or fight to the death here and now with a handful of frightenedslaves as their only allies. Even with so many raiders killed during the selkaattack, the Norukai still outnumbered them many times over. Lila was ready todie to defend him, to kill King Grieve, but Bannon couldn’t bear to see herthrow her life away. He said in a harsh whisper, “Not now.”Grieve growled at her. “I am in no mood for more fighting, but I will kill youand be done with it, if you give me any reason.”Still tense, Lila looked at Bannon, then laid down her sword but without showingany hint of defeat. “I don’t want them to kill you, boy. There will be anothertime.”As he surrendered his sword next to hers, shuddering with exhaustion and fear,Bannon hoped she was right."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48 [part0003.html#a7]To make her preparations before General Utros’s army arrived, Verna studied thesheer cliffs around the main alcove. She and Nathan had discussed the finepoints of the Weeping Stone spell, interpreting the complex nuances of how tosoften the rock and bury the entire archive like fossils in limestone. It wasnot surprising that the naive student Elbert had caused a disaster. Such magicwas like a viper that could strike if not held properly.“The knowledge here could change the world in countless ways.” Nathan soundedforlorn. “The wizards in ancient times knew so much more than we do, and theyhad such great powers. In the right hands, the lore in Cliffwall could make somany lives better, heal terrible diseases, prevent disasters, bring food tostarving villages. If only the right person used it for benevolentreasons . . .” He stroked his chin. “That is always the catch, isn’t it? IfGeneral Utros and his sorceresses use the archive to dominate the world, theamount of suffering they would cause is inconceivable.”Verna shared his deep concern. “I will use the spell only as a last resort, ifall our other defenses collapse. But I am glad we have this option. Either way,General Utros will never possess this archive.”Nathan awkwardly placed a paternal arm around her shoulder. “I couldn’t agreemore, my dear, but I am worried about you.”She responded with a defiant smile. “I am no bumbling novice, Nathan. I can casta protective web, and we will verify that all spell-forms are properly connectedwithin the walls and tunnels. There is enough sorcerer’s sand for us to lay downthe boundaries and through-lines I will need.”She let out a quiet sigh and let him keep his hand on her shoulder. “You and Ihave often been at odds, but trust me in this. I know you and the other gifteddefenders will do your best to block that army, and I would never underestimateyour abilities. But if you and the D’Haran soldiers have to retreat, I need tobe here to trigger the spell. Just in case.”Inside the great overhang, she and Nathan gazed out at the canyon below, whichwas now nearly empty except for Zimmer and his soldiers preparing their laststand. All the traps had been laid, the spells from the archive put in place;all the defenders had taken their positions.Verna said, “I think I have the easy part.”Dangling by ropes, agile acolytes added a few grains of the prismatic sand atappropriate places around the high, sheltered archive. They found niches in thecliff or chipped out special gouges that would hold the grains in the rightplace to anchor the complex lines of magic. Verna had specified the correctplacement deep within the tunnels as well. They had envisioned thethree-dimensional complicated connections of the spell-form that wove throughthe entire library complex. The teams used every last grain of sand thatremained in the porcelain urn.And now Verna was ready.*Astride his black stallion, General Utros stared ahead at the maze of highcanyon walls that closed in around him and his army. The late-morning sun shonedown through a dusty sky, driving the shadows against the cliffs. Next to him,Ruva smiled. Her body was covered with bright paint—black, crimson, white, allthe significant markings she needed.Following guidance from Ava’s spirit to find Cliffwall, the army moved throughthe labyrinth. The high walls amplified the sound of hooves on the rocky ground,the jingle of tack, the men adjusting their armor, shields, and weapons. Themurmur of excited voices echoed around him. They were almost to theirdestination.Utros shifted his heavy helmet. “They know we are coming.”Ruva’s smile hardened. “Even my magic cannot hide an army of so many troops,beloved Utros.”“Don’t even try. I want them to see us. I want them to fear us.”Thanks to Ava, the general knew that they would find the hidden canyon, althoughNathan Rahl or some other gifted person had cast enough distortion and confusionthat even the spirit of the dead sorceress had not been able to learn as much ashe had hoped. The details of the defenses were unknown to him.Riding ahead, his scouts had located the secret entrance, the narrow stonebottleneck that led to the Cliffwall canyon and its towering archive. Six of thescouts had never returned, presumably captured or killed, but he had plenty ofmen to spare. Two intrepid scouts had returned with a report, and that wasenough.His vanguard marched forward in a wedge, the first thousand soldiers pressingdown the canyon. They were prepared to fight through any defenses to reach thesecret archive. No matter how many of them died, Utros could keep pouring inthousands more until they overwhelmed the cliff city. Even the most determinedresistance could not stand up to that.As they rode forward, Ava’s spirit shimmered in front of Utros. “When youconquer Cliffwall, we will possess all that powerful lore, spells that no onecan resist, maybe not even the Keeper himself! We will be invincible.” Shedrifted close to her sister on the bay mare and overlapped Ruva with herinsubstantial form. Again, the twins spoke in a harmonized double voice.“Together we will eradicate the last wizards of Ildakar, and then your army willsweep across the Old World with nothing to hinder us.”“Tell me if you learn anything about their plans,” Utros said. Ava disappearedlike a wisp of greenish steam.The lead horses snorted and plodded along. Utros felt tense and excited, readyfor what was sure to be a wholesale slaughter. Weapons ready, the first footsoldiers marched ahead in organized ranks. As the main canyon narrowed towardthe bottleneck, the companies had to fall behind one another, becoming a humanbattering ram instead of a wave.Ruva fidgeted in her saddle. “Let us go closer. We are almost at the entrance tothe canyon.”Utros urged his black stallion forward. When the front ranks approached thehigh, sheer wall that was really a hidden crack leading into the main canyon,the soldiers stumbled to a halt, milling about, not sure where to go.The general waited as word came back down the line, passed from companycommander to company commander. “The wall is solid, General. There is no openingas we were told. It’s a blind end to a box canyon.”“Not possible,” he said.Ruva interjected, “My sister saw the opening. It has to be there.”He and the sorceress worked their way forward among the armored men. From whatUtros could see, the smooth stone wall did indeed look impenetrable. “Have theysealed it somehow? Closed this canyon?”“If so, then we will blast through it.” Ruva glared at the barrier. “But I sensesomething. . . .” She swept her gaze over the towering uneven surface, thenextended a finger and traced lines through the air as she amplified her focus.“The people of Cliffwall are good at hiding. There is something here other thanstone.” Then she laughed. “It is not a solid barrier, my general! Just anillusion, a camouflage field.”She flung out both hands and released her gift, sending ripples through the air.A line of distortion washed across the cliff barricade as if a thousand spiritforms had been released. The curtain of imaginary rock buckled and faded underRuva’s onslaught, no more than a simple mirage. “Now we can enter.”The soldiers cheered, raised their swords, and prepared to attack.The ground beneath them broke open and began to boil with movement. The sand androcks of the canyon floor suddenly softened, and the soldiers stumbled backward,their boots slipping on the ground. The surface wasn’t just unstable; it spewedforth innumerable scuttling creatures, an infestation of buried scorpions, eachthe size of a man’s hand. The storm of stinging arachnids rushed out with sharplegs, hooked stingers, and snipping claws.The soldiers let out a roar, colliding with one another, swatting, stomping, andslashing to get rid of the deadly bugs. The scorpions stung repeatedly andcrawled all over them as they fell.Undeterred by the distraction, Ruva continued to tear down the camouflagecurtain until it vanished to reveal an entirely different sheer cliff with anoffset opening, a crack wide enough for a flow of soldiers to enter. “There!”As the swarming scorpions continued to pour out of the ground, Utros raised hissword and yelled, “That’s the way in! Charge past the scorpions. Your boots andarmor will protect you.”Though frightened and disorganized, the first terrified soldiers rushed ahead.Belying the general’s promise, more than a hundred men already lay dead on thecanyon floor, poisoned by scorpion venom.“Ride!” Utros kicked his horse forward, with Ruva galloping beside him.Needing no excuse to run, the vanguard charged to the canyon opening. After thecamouflage fell away, the general looked up to see figures high on the cliff,several of them in wizard’s robes. Utros spotted the ambush as the invading armypressed into the bottleneck, running from the scorpions.The surviving wizards of Ildakar began their counterattack.*Just inside the canyon, the D’Haran soldiers stood ready to make their laststand, only a hundred against a hundred thousand. The odds were breathtaking,and impossible. Nathan stood beside General Zimmer, Olgya, Perri, and fiveSisters of the Light. Stationed on the outer wall were Oron and Leo for theinitial defense, in addition to all the traps they had established.Using her expertise, Olgya had woven her camouflage spell, an impenetrableillusion that caused confusion and delay, but Nathan had never expected thedisguise to fool the enemy army for long. Nevertheless, that challengedistracted the vanguard enough for the scorpion trap to be effective.Their plan would depend on numerous smaller victories instead of a singledecisive blow, and the defenders had countless small and innovative attacks.General Utros could not possibly stop them all. Still, a handful of defendersagainst such an overwhelming horde . . .Inside the main canyon from behind the towering walls, they heard the initialattack begin as Leo and Oron summoned their scorpions. Nathan turned to Zimmeras if they were having a dinner conversation. “I can’t say how many times I’vegone to battle against impossible odds, sure that I was going to die.” He gave arueful smile. “Yet here I am, still alive and still fighting.”“One of these days, Wizard, your fears are sure to come true,” Zimmer said.“I might be a thousand years old, but I still have a few things to do in mylife.” Nathan adjusted his blue cape, resplendent in his ruffled shirt and newvest. He also wore the ornate sword, just in case more traditional fightingmight be required.Oliver and Peretta fell back into the canyon, dodging the sharp spikes that hadbeen placed as a primitive but effective line of defense against chargingsoldiers. “Here they come!”Nathan smiled at the clever maliciousness. He had no doubt that the sorceressRuva could strip away Olgya’s camouflage curtain; in fact, they counted on it,because once the illusion faded, the army would plunge headlong, harried by allthe scorpions—and they wouldn’t expect a second camouflage field that hid thespiked spears.The first enemy soldiers began to pour through the bottleneck into the Cliffwallcanyon, but before they got far, the men stumbled into deep, hidden trenches. Athin layer of sand suspended by a levitation field covered the pits, lookinglike solid ground, but as soon as the soldiers stepped on the illusion, the sandand rocks collapsed. They fell screaming, impaled on buried spikes. The firsthundred died without knowing what was happening, and such a nasty surprisedemoralized the next ranks fleeing from the poisonous arachnids. They couldn’tretreat or go forward.But behind them, the invaders kept pushing ahead, running from scorpions, pilingon by the thousands. Even when the soldiers saw the exposed trenches and spikes,they couldn’t get out of the way, and more were forced forward and impaled.Sheer numbers did what caution could not. Body after body fell upon the spikes,skewered on top of the hundreds of soldiers who had died before them. Withinminutes the trenches were filled to the brim with victims, many still squirmingand groaning. The next ranks of soldiers trampled them, packing down thecountless bodies, to push into the canyon.Outside the bottleneck, from the cliffs above, D’Haran ambushers hurled rocksdown upon the soldiers below or fired a stream of arrows. It was a bloodbath.Leo, Oron, and two Sisters of the Light used their gift to call forth lightningand wind that slashed at the invaders. Though he was the former owner of yaxenslaughterhouses, Leo was skilled in winter weather magic. From his perch high upon the cliffs, he created sheets of sleet and ice, slapping down the ranks thathad survived the scorpions and the spikes.In a frenzy after she had dissolved the camouflage field, Ruva lashed out at thewizards above, retaliating with everything she had. Leo balanced on a highoutcropping near the top of the wall, and the sorceress blasted the rock beneathhis feet. The outcropping crumpled. Gaping in astonishment, Leo tumbled downwith a cascade of rock to the base of the canyon. Even as he plummeted, hiswizard’s robes flapping around him, Leo released wild bursts of magic. Hesmashed the opposite cliff and brought rocks down on the gathered soldiers,before he himself was buried in the avalanche. The raging winter winds and snowfaded away.Olgya summoned wisps of fog that built into a snarl of misty curtains thatmuffled visibility. The soldiers stumbled, running into one another, and thesmoke screen tangled about, blinding many. Shapes appeared in the fog, ominoussilhouettes, and the invaders attacked, striking down imaginary enemies, killingmany of their own. The fog was only a distraction, though, and the army movedforward, blindly attacking.Lord Oron and the Sisters continued their ambush from the outside of thebottleneck, but there was no stopping General Utros. The invaders marched overthe corpses of thousands from the front lines. Wearing his horned helmet and hisgold mask, the general looked like a demon as he urged them on.Inside the canyon on the other side of the headwall, Zimmer rallied the line ofdefenders. “Prepare yourselves! We have to hold this opening.”Nathan summoned his gift to fight against the oncoming stampede of swords andmen.Outside the bottleneck, Ruva called up more magic and hurled explosive forcethat made the rock shudder. Twisted lightning cracked fissures in the cliff,flaking boulders away. With a resounding blow, the sorceress shattered theheadwall and brought down a curtain of rock. When the roar quieted and the dustsettled, she had tripled the size of the opening.Ignoring the enormous number of casualties, thousands of howling soldiers surgedinto the hidden canyon with only Nathan and a handful of defenders poised tostand against them."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 49 [part0003.html#a7]Alone inside the evacuated main alcove, Prelate Verna watched the battle at thebottleneck mouth of the canyon where Nathan, General Zimmer, and theirdetermined force stood ready to hold off the invading army. Verna admired theirconfidence, and Nathan often proved stronger than she ever imagined. He hadescaped from the Palace of the Prophets after a thousand years, and he hadremoved his own iron collar, the Rada’Han, which should never have beenpossible. Since that time, he had done great works, achieved amazing success.As she mused about her days long ago at the palace, Verna also thought ofWarren, the studious and warmhearted scholar who had captured her heart. She hadloved him so much. She tried not to think of how he’d been killed fighting thearmies of the Imperial Order. That loss had nearly destroyed her.Once she and Warren had finally found each other, Verna wanted a lifetime withhim, but their time as real lovers was tragically cut short. It was so unfair.She chose to savor the precious memories of what they actually had, rather thangrieve for the time they didn’t. Even though years had passed, she still missedhim. How different her life would have been, if only . . .As the wind whistled along the cliffside, she stepped to the edge of the alcoveand looked down to the stream running through the canyon, saw some scatteredwhite sheep grazing aimlessly with no shepherds to tend them. Other cliffdwellings were empty, and she hoped the evacuated people would all be safe. Ifby some miracle Nathan and the defenders managed to hold the opening and driveaway the invading army, perhaps the people could return.She recalled that she, Renn, and a small group of people had succeeded intriggering the massive avalanches below Kol Adair, wiping out ten thousand ofthe ancient soldiers in a single sweep. Nathan, all the powerfully gifted menand women from Ildakar, her Sisters of the Light, as well as the trainedscholars and D’Haran soldiers could do no less! Maybe they would succeed afterall.But Verna was too pragmatic to believe that, despite Nathan’s confidence, theycould hold the wall permanently against the army’s assault. She knew what had tohappen, and she was ready.The deserted canyon was so empty and silent that Verna felt herself lulled intoa brief moment of security. Swallows flitted about, tending their mud nests insmall pockets in the rock, chirping and singing. She allowed herself a smile andrelished the calm, but knew it wouldn’t last.From outside the canyon she heard the roar and shouts, the clang of weapons asGeneral Utros slammed into the first line of defenses and traps. The D’Harantroops formed a solid barrier just inside the bottleneck. Nathan and his giftedcompanions spread out facing the wall. Even this far away, high up on the cliffface, Verna could feel the tension in the air.When the first lines of enemy soldiers broke through the bottleneck, the magicwas truly unleashed, on both sides. Shock waves rumbled through the narrowcanyon opening, and the rock shuddered and splintered, sloughing down from bothsides. The first ranks of invaders flowed through the gap like a pack of wolves.Shading her eyes, Verna watched Nathan summon balls of wizard’s fire, which hehurled into the oncoming enemy. The angry flames mowed down countless ancientwarriors. Thorn and Lyesse raced about like stinging wasps, stabbing, duckingaway, stabbing someone else.The eight Sisters of the Light raised walls of air and bowled the soldiers back,impaling them on the swords of their own comrades. The gifted Cliffwallscholars, trained in only a few spells, broke more rock shards from the cliffsabove and sent them raining down. Olgya summoned thick tendrils of mist, ashapeless mass of fog that blinded the soldiers as they charged forward, and shefollowed through with targeted lightning, wiping out dozens of the enemy. Perritransformed patches of the ground into quicksand, miring the first line ofinvaders.But for every ten they killed, a hundred more broke through. The invaders werelike an ocean wave that battered against the shore. The D’Haran soldiers metthem with furious resistance. Zimmer bellowed commands and dove into the fray,not afraid to risk himself.Isolated in the alcove high above, with all the silent archive buildings behindher, Verna clenched her fist and despaired at what she saw. The forces ofGeneral Utros kept coming, an endless stream through the blasted bottleneck,hundreds at a time. Even if most of the first wave died, they would eventuallyflood the canyon and overwhelm all resistance through sheer force of numbers.She had known this would happen. She had warned Nathan, yet they still insistedon this last stand. It was good not to give up hope, but it was also good not tobe foolish.She knew it would be her turn soon. She listened to the echoing sounds of battledown below, the shouts of command, screams of pain, explosions and rockfall, theclash of blades. With a pang, she wished Warren could be here to help her. Thetwo of them could have made a grand accounting of themselves.Verna had memorized the Weeping Stone spell. Standing in front of the imposingstructures crowded in the alcove, she looked at the ruin of the melted prophecybuilding. Now she meant to do the same to the entire cliffside and engulf theenemy army with a tidal wave of stone. But Nathan and the surviving defendershad to retreat to safety in time, as did she.She got ready to do what needed to be done. With her gift she could trace thepattern of the spell-form laid down across the cliffside and in the tunnels, anintricate cat’s cradle of connected webs, fields built upon collapsing fields,all waiting for her to tug on the first line of magic that would unravel thewhole thing and set in motion a chain reaction to destroy the dangerousknowledge stored in the archive.“You will never have this place, Utros,” Verna vowed to herself. Once shetriggered the spell, she would climb to safety at the top of the mesa above,using ladders and footholds installed for that purpose, and from there she wouldmake her way to the rendezvous point. The others would also fall back to thehighlands, where they would regroup.Greasy black smoke mixed with a camouflage fog, rising from below after Nathanimmolated more attackers with another round of wizard’s fire. Ranks of theancient army still hammered through the blasted bottleneck. Verna spotted thedistinctive horned helmet of General Utros and the pale sorceress riding besidehim as they emerged through the thick tendrils of mist. They let thousands ofshock troops surge ahead of them, and the renewed surge broke the defensivelines, pushed the gifted fighters and the D’Haran troops back.“It is time for you to go, Nathan,” Verna whispered, as if she could communicatewith him by mere thought. “Go! Now!”Reaching the same conclusion, Zimmer raised his sword and called the retreat.Fortunately, he was a wise tactical commander and had planned for theinevitable. She heard his shout ring out as clearly as a sword strike. “Fallback to the far end of the canyon!”The D’Haran soldiers fought for a few more moments, wanting to kill a last enemywarrior or two. The two morazeth each tried to increase their score of victims.But a dozen of the Cliffwall defenders had already fallen, and they couldn’tafford more losses.Giving them a chance to fall back, Nathan spread out a raging wall of wizard’sfire, smearing his spell into an incandescent swath that incinerated theadvancing enemy line. But as soon as the magical flames dissipated, the nextwave rushed in, trampling the bodies of their fallen comrades.Once the starving invaders saw the green valley enclosed by high rock walls, theorchards, the sheep, and the lush gardens, they raged forward, suddenlydesperate in a different way. Nathan, General Zimmer, and the remainingdefenders retreated in a straight line to the rear of the canyon and the steeptrails up to the highlands. With nothing to stop them now, the enemy army flowedforward and spread out like an angry swarm of bees.From her vantage, Verna watched the armed horde advance into the protectedcanyon. She knew that their last defenses had fallen, and even the faintestchance of victory was gone. It was time for her to do what she had known allalong. She drew a deep breath to calm herself, let it out slowly, inhaledanother. She imagined Warren’s warm presence with her, giving her strength.The prelate pressed her palm against the stone alcove wall. Though she had shownno hesitation in front of Nathan, she was indeed intimidated by the WeepingStone spell. Thousands of years ago, the world’s most powerful wizards hadcreated it, experts much wiser and more adept than any prelate of the Sisters ofthe Light.That spell now would be her final solution. Her gift allowed her to sense theprismatic grains of sorcerer’s sand at the proper key points. She could feel thewebs she had constructed throughout the archive, every anchor poised in the mostdelicate of balances. She didn’t dare trigger the magic too soon, because sheneeded Nathan and the others to get away, and once the spell began to work, shewould scramble up above the alcove and climb to safety.She watched the defenders race along the canyon below, running for their lives.They spread out and darted into side canyons or ran up steep fissures, makingtheir way to higher ground. They had all drilled exhaustively beforehand andknew exactly what to do. Some of the ancient soldiers pursued them, but the bulkof the attacking force swelled beneath the towering, inaccessible archive—theirmain goal. Like a conquering hero, General Utros rode on his black stallionthrough his own soldiers and turned his horned helmet to look up at the greatalcove high up on the cliff.Even from such a distance, Verna met his gaze, she was sure of it. “I will notlet you have this place.” She closed her eyes, touched her gift, tugged on theconnected webs and lines of force that ran through the cliffs. “I weep for thestone to weep.” Tears glistened in her eyes for all the knowledge that was aboutto be lost.She ignited the sorcerer’s sand, connected the nodes in her web, which sentstreaks of fire through the rock and across the open air, which connected thepoints in the elaborate spell-form that she and Nathan had designed. Once shelaunched the spell, the power surged, bounced, ricocheted like a releasedspring. She smiled: the spell would complete its work now, no matter whathappened.When the hard stone of the alcove wall softened and turned to clay against herfingertips, she knew it was time to leave. Lines of transformation shot throughthe cliff, disassembling the mineral structure. Rumbling sounds came from deeperinside the mesa as tunnels collapsed and filled, but the main reshaping of stonehappened here on the outer wall.Verna ran to the wooden ladder that had been mounted against the cliff wall,leading to handholds and ledges above the alcove mouth. She heard a dripping,rumbling sound, and the glorious buildings inside the grotto wavered. Theirfoundations liquefied, and the structures themselves toppled over like hugetrees felled by a woodcutter. The bricks and stone blocks broke apart and spatout into the air like broken teeth, tumbling into one another. The outer cliffwall began to flow like wax as the hard rock became mud, slumping down in tearsof stone. The vaulted alcove opening began to droop down like a swollen eyelid.Verna scrambled up the ladder, climbing above the overhang. The wooden rungswere still solid, unaffected by the spreading spell, but the end of the laddersank into the buttery stone, making the steps slanted and unstable. The changewas happening faster than she expected. The already-ruined prophecy buildingvanished entirely, buried as the roof of the alcove flowed over the top of it.She pulled herself higher, above the mouth of the alcove, and paused to watchthe canyon wall slump down below her. A stone wave flowed onto the first enemysoldiers, and the triumphant roar of the invading army turned into howls ofdismay. They tried to flee, but could not escape the liquid rock that washedover them.Reaching the top rung of the ladder, Verna stretched her arm and pulled herselfup with the stone handholds dug into the cliff. She found a stable place for herfoot. As she climbed toward the top of the plateau and safety, the spellcontinued building, cascading throughout the cliff. Inside the mesa, thenumerous vaults of magical lore had filled in, and all the tunnels inside wereerased. The countless shelves of books were now like ancient fossil bonesembedded in stone.Verna laughed with relief as the sloughing sound rose to a deafening roar. Shehad succeeded! It was enough. The swelling magic rang throughout her body andshe pulled on the gift to find the connected webs, ready to pull the WeepingStone spell to a halt. The sorcerer’s sand anchored the key angles of thespell-form, but as the cliff collapsed, their positions shifted and swallowedthe powerful grains, muffled by layers of stone. The precise pattern wasdisrupted.The spell was like a monster that had broken loose.Alarmed, Verna clenched her teeth and used her gift to strain against theunraveling webs like a rider trying to rein in a wild horse. In an odd displacedmoment, she remembered how Richard Rahl had taught her to use a much kinder biton her horse, which made the animal easier to control. Richard had cared aboutthe horses as much as he cared about other people. She had learned so much fromRichard. . . . But he wasn’t here to help her now.The Weeping Stone spell expanded rather than diminishing, as it was supposed to.Verna had acted as a catalyst and released the power pent up inside the ancientarchive, and now the destructive magic grew like a conflagration.As she held on and wrestled with the uncontrollable spell, a shimmering imageswooped up in the air next to her, the sickly green form of the sorceress Ava.“I see your spell!” her hollow voice cried, rising to a shriek. “You will notstop the general.”Verna held on to the cliff handholds, knowing that the intangible spirit coulddo little to harm her directly. Ava hovered closer, intimidating, trying toterrify the prelate. “I cannot let you do this!”But Verna was not easily terrified. As the spell continued to roar, bringingdown the cliffside, she thrashed the air with her free hand, trying to drive thespirit away, but Ava filled her vision, disoriented her.The Weeping Stone spell thrashed and writhed, and Verna’s attention slipped. Avadrew away her focus at a critical point.Having climbed above the alcove to the stable rock, Verna thought she was safelyaway from the destruction, but to her dismay the cliffs above her began tocollapse as well, far beyond what should have been the boundary of the spell.“No, this isn’t possible!”The cliff poured down to bury the ranks of the enemy army. A flood of stonepaved over thousands of soldiers who rode through the canyon below.Ava made one last brash attack in the prelate’s face, a mirage with only abreath of tangible form. But as the walls collapsed in a wholesale disaster, thespirit cried out in dismay and vanished, swooping down toward General Utros.Verna strained upward to reach a point where she could hold on and fight back,where she could stop the melting stone. She climbed several body lengths higher,but her foothold slipped away like a slurry of mud. The rocky knob in her handbecame as soft as butter.And she fell.She dropped down the cliff face, clawing for a handhold in a mudslide. Herfingers caught in the soft stone, and she dug in up to her knuckles, but herweight dragged her down, and she gouged long furrows in the stone.Verna attempted to use her gift to arrest her fall, still trying to dampen theoverall spell. Despite all her reassurances to Nathan about being able to handlethe power she unleashed, the connected webs and interlinked fields escaped hercontrol. She sank and rolled in the liquefied rock.With a last burst of magic, she deflected the fields and paused the spell sothat the flowing rock hardened around her lower legs. But that did no good. Shewas trapped in a fist of stone, hanging upside down just above the canyon floor,where she watched more of the armored soldiers die.She couldn’t break free, but the cliff kept melting. Stone sloshed around heruntil finally Verna was buried in a wave that petrified around her.Her last thoughts were filled with hope that her spirit would at last bereunited with Warren’s beyond the veil, and they would have all eternitytogether."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50 [part0003.html#a7]After the selka attack, the three battered serpent ships limped across the calmocean toward the scattered Norukai islands. More than forty raiders had beenkilled by the selka before the serpent god arrived. Now the survivors lickedtheir wounds, sewed up deep gashes, and admired their scars. Now they wanted togo home.By now, only ten slaves remained alive on the main vessel. As a result, therewere not enough captives to man the oars, and the Norukai were forced to workalongside the slaves, grumbling at having to row like the walking meat.Devastated by the death of Chalk, though, King Grieve refused to toleratecomplaints. He spoke little except to snarl orders, clearly in the mood to killsomething. He slammed his iron-plated fist against the head of a man whoobjected too strenuously to the menial work, cracking his skull, and the othercrew members quickly muted their complaints.“Remember your king,” Grieve roared, then lowered his voice. “Remember Chalk. Weall grieve.”Bannon and Lila pulled to the sullen beat of oar master Bosko. Bannon mutteredto Lila as they pulled the wooden oars, “We both could have died fighting thatnight. I hope the Norukai islands aren’t worse than death.”Lila’s expression darkened. “I chose to keep you alive, boy. Now we have todecide how best to spend the rest of our days.” Her chains rattled as shestrained against the oar. “I plan to make the Norukai pay a great debt of blood.We will have our chance.”Bannon agreed with her.The serpent ships sailed for two more days until the lookout sighted the firstof the islands. Stark and ominous, the hummocks of rock looked like rotten teethrising from the water. After the mourning king’s harsh discipline, the Norukaiuttered a subdued cheer upon seeing their home again.King Grieve stood at the prow, his large hand resting on the serpent godfigurehead. He stared at the main island, a rough-edged black monstrosity with anarrow protected harbor. A looming fortress occupied the pinnacle of the mainisland, its sheer walls made of perfectly fitted black stone blocks, high abovethe crashing waves.“The Bastion,” Grieve said in a hollow voice.Water foamed along hazardous reefs, but the Norukai expertly guided their threevessels toward the narrow harbor. Dozens of serpent ships were anchored in thewater of the archipelago, while others were under construction in dry docks.Lila responded to the sight with a grim frown. “Nearly a hundred ships weredestroyed at Ildakar, but he has at least as many more here.”Some of the anchored serpent ships were old and weathered, but many had new woodand fresh blue sails. Bannon’s throat went dry. “They continued building theirnavy even after King Grieve and his fleet sailed off to conquer Ildakar.” Heknew that General Utros was already leading his army overland, and now this hugeNorukai fleet looked ready to ransack the cities of the coast. He wished Nicciand Nathan were there to help them. “How will the Old World survive this, Lila?What can we do to stop them?”“We’ll find a way to break free,” Lila said, keeping her hard voice low. “We candefeat them all.”On deck, Grieve stood in silence like a figure carved out of anger. He grippedhis war axe and looked ready to cleave any person who gave him a reason to doso. The king’s dark mood could not diminish the excitement of the other Norukai,though, and they rallied when they saw the large gathering of ships.The three returning vessels pulled into the sheltered harbor of the main island.Some of the gruff raiders chattered, eager to see their wives and husbands. OneNorukai woman pointed to other distinctive serpent ships in the main harbor.“Look, Lars is back!” When she gnashed her teeth, her scarred jaw rippled.With disgust, Bannon remembered Lars, one of the three Norukai captains thatcame to Ildakar to sell their slaves. Egged on by his supposed friends Amos,Jed, and Brock, Bannon had brawled with Lars and his companions. “Sweet SeaMother, I’d like a chance to kill him. He’s the reason I was sentenced to thecombat pits.”Lila laughed. “I understand why you hate that man, boy, but think of theunexpected reward you received. If not for your foolish street fight, you wouldnever have become my trainee. Now you are skilled enough to kill many Norukai.”“I will put your training to good use, I promise,” Bannon said. “As soon as weget the chance.”Looking up at the steep hills around the Bastion, he saw garden terraces fromwhich hanging clumps of succulent weeds draped down the sheer rock. The Norukaipicked out an existence on the windswept island, growing what they could whileraiding for anything else they required.When the three ships tied up to the pier, the raiders detached the slaves’ anklechains, but kept their hands bound as they herded them off the ship. Grievesnarled, “Take them to the Bastion and add them to the workforce until they arebroken.” He grimaced with his scarred lips. “Or killed.”A woman with the physique of a bear marched toward them along the dock. Hertreelike legs were bare except for boots that rose to her knees. She wore aleather skirt studded with brass knobs. A tight sharkskin wrap around her torsowas strained to near the breaking point by her large breasts. Her square facewas as lovely as a blacksmith’s anvil, and ropy red hair was tied in five longbraids that hung like tentacles. When she opened her mouth to yell a greeting,she looked even more like a serpent. “King Grieve, I was tired of waiting foryou.” Her voice was so loud that the chatter from the disembarking crew fellinto a lull. “I am ready to be your lover again. Don’t miss your chance!”The woman stepped up to Grieve as if she intended to collide with him. SomeNorukai chuckled, but the king’s face was stormy. “Atta. I’ve given no thoughtto you since we departed.”“I haven’t wasted time on you either,” Atta barked. “I have taken other lovers,but they were inadequate. When I saw your ships return, I decided to give youanother chance.” She punched him hard on the shoulder as if it were aflirtation. When he punched her back and knocked her reeling, Atta just laughed.Bannon recalled the name. In his many unwanted soliloquies, Chalk had rambledabout someone named Atta. Now, Bannon whispered to Lila, “Once, Grieve wasinjured so badly that he had to miss a Norukai raid, and Atta mocked him for it.Grieve broke her jaw so that she had to remain behind too.”“Ah, and that is how they became lovers,” Lila concluded. She seemed to thinkthere was nothing unusual about that form of courtship.Hearing Lila speak, Atta turned to sneer at her, regarding the lean morazeth asif she were a gutted fish in the market. “And who are you?” She scowled at thescant black leather garments Lila wore. “You think you can seduce my Grieve? Hewould break you.”“If he tried, I would break something of his,” Lila said.When the other Norukai snickered at the retort, the beefy woman smashed Lila onher already bruised face. Lila reeled, but managed to keep her feet. King Grieveused the distraction to stalk away down the pier, ignoring the woman. Attahuffed and strode after him.Bannon and the slaves were marched away from the docks, dragged up steep pathsuntil they reached the imposing stone foundation of the Bastion on the steepslopes. Their way was blocked by a low barred gate that led into the massivefortress. The iron bars swung open on creaking hinges to reveal a Norukai guardglowering at the slaves. “All of you will be taken to stations to help preparethe homecoming feast.”With their hands bound in front of them, the rest of the slaves staggered behindBannon and Lila into the dank, cold passageway. Chill winds and the damp of thesea rendered the corridor miserable. Water dripped from salt encrustations onthe ceiling, and slimy algae made the floor slippery. Though her black leathercovered little of her skin, Lila showed no sign of being uncomfortable, justrazor sharp in her determination.The guard led them along, ducking under the low ceiling. Other guards followedthe line, shoving the slaves when they moved too slowly. They climbed twistingstairs and through passageways lit only by smoky torches.Without any windows or sunlight, Bannon lost all sense of direction, but Lilasilently marked and memorized every step. Finally they entered a cavernous,noisy chamber with fiery ovens, barrels of flour, large stone countertops, andgaunt workers preparing a huge meal. Fish roasted on grates over fires thatroared into multiple chimneys. Fish stew simmered in large cauldrons.The smells were as powerful as the clamor of the pots and pans. Bannon’s hungerincreased like a sudden wildfire. For many days he’d had nothing to eat but fishguts and slop, and now the aroma of baking bread and charred fish made himweak-kneed.“Food!” cried one of the captives behind him, extending his bound wrists in anattempt to grab a knot of bread left on a counter.A veteran kitchen slave lashed out, “Stop! Don’t touch.” He lifted his left armto show the stump of his wrist. “Or they’ll cut off your hand, then cook it andeat it as part of the feast.” The newcomers quailed even as they drooled at thebounty around them.An old man limped up to greet the Norukai guard. “New slaves? How many?” Hisface was so wrinkled he looked like a raisin dried in the sun. His eyes roamedover the new group. “Ten. That’ll be helpful. King Grieve hasn’t replaced theBastion staff in a long time.”The guard merely grunted and tugged Bannon in front of the wrinkled old slave,glad to be rid of his charges. This seemed to be a demeaning activity to him.The old man took a kitchen knife and sawed the ropes that bound Bannon’s wrists,then methodically lurched down the line, freeing the rest of the captives. Hemuttered to himself, “Twenty loaves of bread, three barrels of salted fish, fiveplatters of pickled cliffweed, one for each table.” As he cut the bonds of onefemale slave, she collapsed, but the old man grabbed her bloody raw wrists andhauled her to her feet again. “No time for that! All of us have work to do. IfKing Grieve is disappointed in the feast, he’ll eat you instead.”Bannon did not think it was an idle threat. The old man continued his muttering.“Salted fish, smoked fish, and fresh fish for the king.” He heaved a sigh.“Although the king hates fish. Doesn’t like goat either.” He addressed the newarrivals. “I am Emmett, and I’m here to help you—help you serve King Grieve.Most Bastion slaves do not last long, but I have been here for ten years, longerthan any other captive. If you follow my instructions, I will see to it that yousurvive.”“Why would you do that?” Lila demanded.“Because I need the help.” Emmett lowered his voice, though there was only oneNorukai near the far entrance to the kitchen, a husky woman who looked bored anddisappointed. He pulled the new arrivals together and whispered in aconspiratorial, urgent voice. “I will help you stay alive, but you must listento me. If you cause trouble, the king will break your bones and set them wrong,just so you remember.” He looked down at his badly healed leg.Lila flexed her fingers and frowned at her scabbed wrists. “My intent is to killas many Norukai as possible. That’s why I let myself be captured. I’m going tofree Bannon, then I will escape.” She looked at the other frightened slaves,thinking they were weak. “If you are useful, we may allow you all to join uswhen we leave here.”Emmett quailed. “That isn’t how you stay alive! The Norukai will kill you. Trustme, I’ve seen it happen many times.”“You have not seen me,” Lila said.“Or me,” Bannon added. “She’s a morazeth, and I was trained in the combat pitsof Ildakar. We may have a better chance than our predecessors.”Emmett groaned, deeply saddened. “Then I can’t help you to stay alive.” Back tobusiness, he snapped his head up so abruptly that his gray ponytail bounced.“Right now, there’s work to do here. Throw your lives away later, after thefeast is over. No time to clean any of you up. No fresh clothes, but you—” Helooked at Lila and her scant black leather outfit. “Yes, you in particular, Iwill give you an old, drab robe to cover yourself.”She was insulted. “I am proud of my body. This garment marks me as a morazeth.”“That garment marks you as an object of desire.” Emmett looked frantic. “Do youwant to be passed from table to table in a banquet hall full of lusty Norukaimen? And women?”“They can try,” Lila said. “They will regret it.”Bannon remembered the mangled would-be rapist aboard the serpent ships afterLila had been captured, but he didn’t want to test that again. He urged her,“Lila, it would be best not to call attention to yourself. Let’s choose our owntime to fight. Not now.” Emmett brought forth a gray, tattered wool garment shecould drape over herself, and Bannon pleaded with her. “Just wear it.”“You may have a point, boy,” she admitted, and pulled the shapeless loosegarment over her head to drape her body. “But I don’t like it.”Emmett wrung his hands. “Come, we have to start serving. Captain Lars is alreadyin the banquet hall, and King Grieve will arrive soon. You all must serve.”“I may be forced to bring them food,” Lila said, “but I will not serve.”When the old man swallowed, the wrinkles puckered on his wattled neck. He shookhis head. “It is my fervent hope that you all survive the meal.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 51 [part0003.html#a7]The kraken-hunter ship cut swiftly across the sea, heading north towardTanimura. With her gift, Nicci summoned fair winds that stretched the patchworksails, with the added advantage that the breeze diminished the foul smell thatclung to the vessel.The Chaser was mostly empty, now that the refugees had been off-loaded atSerrimundi, and the captain used the opportunity to have his crew patch andscrub the vessel. “Peel off at least a few layers of dried slime. I want to seesome of the grain in the wood.”“Slime? You called it varnish before, Captain!” one of the shirtless men calledback with a laugh. His voice whistled through missing front teeth.“Indulge me.” Jared smiled. “We’ll cover it up with more kraken slime soonenough. If we see one of the beasts, I’m up for a hunt.” The rest of the crewcheered.Nicci did not want any delay. “We must reach Tanimura with all due haste,Captain. No time for hunting.”“We’ll get there before you know it, Sorceress.” Jared chuckled dismissively.“Remember, you were going to ride a smelly horse all this way.” The rest of thecrew snickered, finding the suggestion ridiculous.That night, Nicci joined the captain in his cabin for dinner, a slab of rubberykraken meat. Jared devoured the meal with relish, and though Nicci found littleabout the food appealing, she ate anyway. “I’ve tasted worse,” she said, andJared took it as a compliment.The krakener had a crew of fifteen who had been together for years, unlike manyother ships, whose crews changed at every port. Kraken hunting was a hard,dirty, smelly job, and usually thankless. The men who worked such ships kept tothemselves even in the dockside taverns, where they were considered a lowerclass than the crews of cargo ships. Nicci could tell that the lingering aromaof the slimy creatures would not wash away even after repeated trips tobathhouses, so these men accepted their lot and enjoyed their labors.Jared was immensely proud of how many kraken kills he had made, how many cargoloads he had delivered to cities along the coast. “Those who like kraken meatlook forward to my arrival. We are greeted with resounding cheers whenever wecome to port.” He gave his rakish smile.“You are cheered by everyone who appreciates kraken meat?” she asked. “Thatcan’t be a very large number.”“They have discriminating tastes.” He cut a chunk of the gray meat and chewed onit with a look of satisfaction. He washed down his meal with a gulp of ale.Nicci found herself taking more and more drinks of the bitter beer to counteractthe taste. “I’ll be glad to get back to kraken hunting, as soon as we defeat allthese enemies you talk about.”“This war won’t be over for a long time, and it’s about to get much worse.That’s why I need to get to Tanimura and rally the D’Haran garrison.” She bither lower lip. “I only hope that by now reinforcements have arrived from LordRahl. I dispatched an important message to him the last time I came here.”Nicci felt a pang to think that she was so far away from Richard, the man shetruly loved. She and Nathan were doing this task for him, helping to spread theword of the D’Haran Empire, and now she needed Richard’s help. If he sent apowerful military force marching south to Tanimura as a defense against thedouble threat, Nicci knew their victory was assured. Richard had never let herdown.“Just get me to Tanimura, Captain,” she said, “and you will have done a greatservice for the war effort.”*When the Chaser entered Tanimura Harbor, Nicci regarded the whitewashedbuildings of the city she knew so well. Houses were crowded against one another,forming uneven lines of streets and alleys. Banners rippled from rooftops,showing the colors of D’Hara and the stylized “R” of Lord Rahl. Fishing boatsand cargo ships crowded the harbor, but most importantly she saw dozens of largevessels that had been refitted as warships for the D’Haran navy. The sightsatisfied her greatly, showing that General Linden had heeded her warning andbegun to build up serious defenses.Tanimura Harbor was much larger than Serrimundi’s enclosed, sheltered harbor.Assisted by Nicci’s directed breezes, the krakener cut a straight line towardthe docks. The Chaser cruised past the flat expanse of Halsband Island, whichwas separate from the main city although it had been connected by gracefulbridges. The island once held the towering Palace of the Prophets, where Niccihad lived for many decades as a Sister of the Light and secretly as a Sister ofthe Dark. She had trained here and served here, and she had also served theKeeper of the underworld. Now the entire island was just rubble. By triggeringthe constructed spell that ran through the palace, Richard Rahl had brought downthe gigantic structure.Jared stood next to her, holding the ship’s rail. “Ah, Tanimura! I love thesmell of that harbor.”Nicci couldn’t smell anything beyond the fishy slime of the krakener. “It isgood to be home,” she said, but her voice held no warmth. This place had toomuch darkness for her.After the Chaser docked, Nicci disembarked quickly, intent on reaching thegarrison. Captain Jared called after her as she walked down the gangplank, “Myship is at your disposal, should you ever need it again, Sorceress!”“I’ll remember that. It was a fast ship.”“With a good captain,” he said.She didn’t reply as she worked her way through the bustle of dockside activity.Mules pulled wagons loaded with heavy crates; men stacked bales of hay and sacksof grain where merchants dickered over prices. Familiar sights and soundsbrought back memories of when she had been an acolyte determined to serve theImperial Order, because her mother had beaten those teachings into her. Thatupbringing had sent her down a dark path that had only worsened until Niccifinally reached a crossroads in her life in a man named Richard Rahl. . . .Now, she moved through the streets toward the D’Haran garrison. Several weeksago, General Linden had dispatched a rider up to the People’s Palace carryingher message and her request for help. Nicci knew Richard would believe her aboutthe threat of General Utros. A large army of reinforcements might not have madethe journey yet, but she expected they were on the way. She hoped Richard had atleast sent a reply. She had not heard from him in such a long time.Approaching the garrison, she was relieved to see soldiers patrolling thestreets in chain mail and leather armor, with the officers wearing colorfulcapes. Word traveled swiftly as she walked at a deliberate pace, and by the timeshe reached the gates of the walled garrison, many soldiers had lined up,anxious to hear what she had to say.“It’s the sorceress!”“Nicci’s back.”“Death’s Mistress!”The anxious garrison soldiers parted as Nicci walked straight across thetraining yard and past the barracks to the two-story headquarters building. Ithad been built with fresh-sawn wood and only recently whitewashed to match thecommon architecture in Tanimura.At their desks in the first offices, clerks looked up from writing notations intheir ledgers, but she strode past them without a word. As she climbed thestairs to the second story, she had no doubt that General Linden would alreadybe waiting for her.Indeed, he sat at his desk, hands folded. Linden was a thin, thirtyish man,young for his high rank but promoted after so many officers had been killed inthe previous war. A port-wine birthmark was prominent on his left cheek, and hiscrooked nose had obviously been broken more than once.He gave her a serious nod of welcome. “I didn’t expect you back so soon,Sorceress. We are working hard to increase the city’s defenses. We builtwarships and refitted other vessels so we can secure the harbor. Our patrolshave doubled on the water. Troop numbers have increased substantially, and weare getting stronger every day.”“Good,” Nicci said. “General Utros is on the move, as I feared, and the Norukaiare ravaging the cities on the coast. Serrimundi was attacked not long ago, aswas Effren, and possibly Larrikan Shores. Things are about to get much worse.”“Yes, we’ve received reports.” Linden tapped his finger on the desk. He hadstraightened the papers in front of him in anticipation of her arrival. “Wedispatched aid down to Serrimundi after the last Norukai raid, and we arerecruiting widely among the city people and the hill villages. I want to expandthe army so that each large town has a well-armed defense force against otherraids.”She stepped forward to grip the edge of his desk. “Make no mistake, General,these are not just raids. The ancient army of Utros forged an alliance with KingGrieve of the Norukai. Together, they will overrun the Old World. Did my messagereach D’Hara?” she asked, realizing that was the answer she most wanted to hear.“Will Lord Rahl send the D’Haran army to defend us? If your courier traveled asswiftly as I hope, the troops should already be on the way. We will need themsoon.”Worry lines appeared on Linden’s brow. Subconsciously, he rubbed his birthmarkwith his thumb. “Lord Rahl did send a response. He says he would like to aidTanimura and the threatened cities, but . . . it is not possible at this time.He and D’Hara cannot help you.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52 [part0003.html#a7]Exhausted and soaked with blood from all the enemy soldiers he killed, Nathanhauled himself up the rocks at the end of the dwindling side canyon. He climbedhandhold after handhold, anxious to reach the highlands and the wilderness wherethey could shelter. Olgya climbed next to him, along with ten D’Haran soldierswho had retreated with their band. On General Zimmer’s instructions, thedefenders had separated into many different parties, all taking differentroutes.One of the wounded soldiers with them, a cocky card player, was bleeding badlyfrom a deep gash in his side. He spilled a trail of red as he plodded alongsidethe others, painstakingly working his way higher. Nathan wasn’t certain the manwould survive much longer. Though the wizard had little strength left, he couldhave used his gift to heal the deep cut, if they stopped for a while and rested.But that was not an option. Utros threw thousands upon thousands of warriorsafter the last surviving defenders of Cliffwall, and they kept closing in.When Nathan finally reached a high point, he turned and watched Verna’s WeepingStone spell destroy Cliffwall. The roof of the archive grotto dripped down andclosed over, sealing the tunnels and the library chambers forever. The rockwalls melted and sagged like a mudslide, pouring down onto part of the army.Even from his distant vantage, Nathan could feel the prelate’s building magicthat resonated through lines of force. The sheer walls began to run like wax,and as the destruction continued, he stared in disbelief. Verna had only plannedto collapse the alcove opening and seal the books and scrolls in stone beforeshe retreated. But the devastation continued to unfold. “Dear spirits, she isdestroying the entire canyon!”He saw Verna’s tiny figure climbing above the slumping alcove, racing to get outof the way, but the stone itself shifted beneath her. Nathan sensed the exactpoint at which she lost control of the powerful spell. It was like a vicious dogthat turned on its master.Beside him, Olgya and the soldiers watched half of the Cliffwall canyon turninto liquid, and the flood of stone rolled down to engulf the countless ancientwarriors. With a groan of dismay, Nathan watched Prelate Verna slip and plungeinto the flowing rock. She tried to pull herself out, but sank down, engulfed.The world went silent as the shock shut down his senses. His heart ached with aswell of memories. So much of his life had been bound up with the prelate. Hehad never loved Verna as he had come to love her predecessor, Prelate Ann, butnow watching her die, he felt a tremendous blow. Tears glistened in his azureeyes and spilled down his cheeks.Elsa had done a similar thing, unleashing enough magic to save them, even thoughshe knew it would destroy her. Now both of those marvelous women were gone,sacrificing their lives in order to wound the army of General Utros.After Verna died, her spell faded, and the lines of magic came untangled asfields collapsed and webs unraveled. The stone hardened again.While the refugees stared in horror, though, they lost track of their pursuers.With an outcry, one of the gaunt enemy soldiers charged toward them with anotched sword. The wounded card player had sagged down on a rock to rest,bleeding heavily from his side, but now he lurched to his feet and used the lastof his strength to deflect the attacker’s sword. He drove his own dagger intothe enemy’s throat, but in the process he suffered another deep stab wound.Dying, the card player pushed himself over the edge of the drop-off so that bothhe and the ancient soldier tumbled down the steep canyon in a bloody tangle ofarms and legs.Although Nathan’s party had finished the climb and worked their way into thehigh desert wilderness, enemy stragglers still pursued them up the canyon.Blocking off his grief, he found the strength to call up more wizard’s fire, asphere in each hand. With anger at Verna’s death driving him, he hurled thesearing fire toward the pursuers. They threw up their gauntleted arms to deflectthe fire, but they could not block the unstoppable inferno that burned them toashes.Nathan dropped to his knees and wept. His long white hair was a tangled mess.His new vest and embroidered cape dripped with blood and human cinders. Duringthe battle at the bottleneck in the headwall, he and his gifted companions hadused every desperate trick, all the spells they knew. He had even killed fivewith his sword, and now his arm was sore from ringing blows.Olgya stepped closer to him. She was compact and tough, wearing skirts and awrap of her enhanced silk, which remained unfrayed even after all the abuse.Crimson droplets spattered her face. One of her tight braids had been severed bya knife stroke, and the ragged end hung down to her ear like a decapitatedsnake. Her expression was tight, as if all the gift had been wrung out of her,but she clung to life and determination. She nodded at the blackened stains inthe wake of his wizard’s fire. “We don’t have to worry about pursuit anymore,Nathan. We can take care of any stragglers that managed to get through.”Nathan wiped his cheek and looked back down the canyon to where the flood ofrock had rehardened, leaving innumerable bodies trapped within like flies inamber. “I know. Prelate Verna did what she needed to. Neither General Utros noranyone else will get their hands on the dangerous knowledge from the archive. Itis gone forever.”“It was necessary to protect the world,” Olgya said. “We all agreed.”“That’s true, but Verna is gone . . . just as Elsa is gone. With each victorylike this, we lose a part of ourselves and a part of our heritage. What will beleft of us when all is said and done?” He turned away so he no longer had tolook at the ruins of the once peaceful canyon. He couldn’t even feel satisfiedto know how many of the enemy soldiers had been killed in the flood of stone.Thousands? Tens of thousands?Verna was still dead, and the core of Utros’s army was still out there. Evenwith Cliffwall destroyed, they would continue marching across the Old World.“Let’s get to the rendezvous point,” Nathan growled, “and take stock of who wehave left.”*They followed a tangled route through the high canyons up and beyond Cliffwall,and they met up with the other evacuating parties. Thorn and Lyesse guided sixsoldiers, Rendell, and a handful of shaken Cliffwall scholars. The two morazethwere covered with gore and soot, their rune-marked skin laced with minor wounds,but they were charged with energy, as if this were no more than an enjoyablegame of Ja’La.Thorn looked at her partner. “We killed so many that we each lost track of ourscore.”Lyesse said, “Therefore we will consider it a tie and start over. I look forwardto the challenge.”The other woman nodded. “There will be more of them to kill.”When all the groups gathered in their makeshift camp, Oron was clearly relievedto see that Nathan, Olgya, and Perri had survived. “Good, we could not afford tolose more of our gifted.”“We’ve already lost too many,” Nathan said.“Who else is gone?” Olgya asked, looking around and counting heads.Oron described how the wizard Leo had fallen from the outer cliff when Ruvablasted the stone. In addition to many D’Haran soldiers, two of Captain Trevor’sIldakaran guards had been killed. Perri hunkered down and shook her head.“Almost nothing remains of our great city of Ildakar anymore.”“We remain,” Lord Oron said.“There won’t be much left of the Old World once General Utros is through withit,” Nathan said. “Ah, Verna . . . poor Verna.”The Sisters of the Light were deeply shaken by the loss of their prelate.Sisters Rhoda and Eldine joined Nathan by the small campfire. “After the starshift eliminated prophecy, our order’s reason for existence suffered a terribleblow,” Rhoda said. “But Verna didn’t give up. She helped us try to find newpurpose.”“No, Verna did not give up,” Nathan said. “She made quite a difference for allof us, and for me in particular.”More Sisters joined him, and they all reminisced about the prelate. Nathan letout a bitter laugh, and when Mab looked at him in surprise, he said,“Considering all the resentments I held for the Sisters of the Light, the ironyis deep that you should comfort me.”Amber also joined the group. “We should all comfort one another, because we’veall been hurt, but we have to keep moving.” She looked around for reassurance.“We are going to keep moving, aren’t we? General Utros and his army willcontinue marching to the coast. My brother Norcross is at Renda Bay. He’ll helpus fight.”“Yes, my dear,” Nathan said. “We must get to Renda Bay before that army does.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 53 [part0003.html#a7]The Norukai celebration for King Grieve and Captain Lars was loud, boisterous,and violent. Bannon found it sickening.Caked with blood and covered with bruises and scabs from the selka attack, alongwith the daily abuse they suffered aboard the serpent ships, the new slaves werepressed into service in the Bastion kitchens. Overworked and terrified, oldEmmett limped about loading platters with food, including a goat that stillsizzled on the spit.The head slave barked orders to his sullen kitchen crew, occasionally pausingfor hurried explanations to the newcomers who didn’t know what to do. “Take theroast goat! There’s a rack behind the king’s throne. He will slice off the meathimself, and I pray he doesn’t complain that it’s too bloody, if he is evenwilling to eat goat tonight. I don’t dare tell him the banquet isn’t ready.”Emmett sighed, panting hard. “I have seen Grieve eat animals raw, and maybehe’ll be in that sort of mood. I wish I had something other than goat orfish. . . .”One of the kitchen slaves, a downcast man with a scar on his cheek, picked up anend of the spit while a new slave was shoved forward to take the other end. Theyshuffled off with their burden as a Norukai guard marched behind them. Wholefish were scraped from racks in the fiery ovens and placed on platters. Urns ofpickled fish were carried off by slaves who staggered under the weight. When onesuch urn was thrust into Bannon’s arms, he looked down into the hunks of graymeat preserved in salt water, vinegar, and lye. The stench reminded him of thehorribly preserved fish that was a food staple during lean years on ChiriyaIsland. As the fumes roiled up, he held the urn as far out in front of him aspossible and followed the roasted goat.Emmett gave Lila a brass pitcher of wine, and she glared daggers at him. “I haveno wish to pander to these vile creatures.” She looked uncomfortable in theformless dress that covered her slender body.“Neither do I, but my wish to live is stronger than my disgust, and if you wantto survive, then you must cooperate.” The old slave’s voice had a pleading tone.“After the banquet is over, I can explain in detail how the Bastion functionsand how you may be able to live another day, another month, and another year.”When the Norukai guards had left the kitchen to escort the servers, Lila slowlyand deliberately dripped a mouthful of spit into the open pitcher of wine. Theother slaves watched her, shocked but titillated.Emmett was horrified. “They’ll cut you into pieces and roast you in thefireplace if they find out!”The morazeth faced him, defiant. “They didn’t see me, and you aren’t going totell them.”On his way out the door with his pickled fish, Bannon saw what she had done.Mirroring her rebelliousness, he dredged up a lump of phlegm and spat it intothe urn. “Sweet Sea Mother, we have to fight in any way we can.”The corridor beyond the kitchens led into a loud banquet hall. The walls wereblack stone, and smoke-stained timbers crossed the ceiling. Desiccated headshung from hooks on the rafters, probably enemies that King Grieve had slain.The banquet hall sounded like a battlefield, with boasting Norukai, poundingfists on tables, calls for food, and shouted insults. Six long tables werecrowded with Norukai warriors who sported an array of hideous disfigurements ontheir faces, heads, and shoulders. The women raiders looked just as ugly as themen, and they growled at one another, striking and then being struck back inwhat Bannon realized was a brutal form of courtship.At the front table, King Grieve slumped in a blocky throne that looked like atorture device. The bone spurs implanted in his shoulders poked out of hissharkskin vest like upthrust teeth. He hunched, brooding and bristling, deaf tothe roar of conversation and the rowdy guests. He rested his clenched fists onthe tabletop and just stared ahead. At the empty place beside him, Grieve hadupturned a much smaller chair and smashed it on the table surface so that no onewould ever sit there again. Bannon realized that must have been Chalk’s seat.The coarse woman Atta sat on the opposite side of the throne, as if she ownedGrieve, but the king paid little attention to her. At the second table, thenewly returned raider captain Lars sat like some kind of celebrity. Bannonrecognized the man from Ildakar, and hated him. Lars was already half drunk, andBannon wondered if the disgusting raider would remember him.King Grieve suddenly sat up and pounded his fist on the table. “I gave you adeath sentence, Lars.” The conversation fell swiftly into uneven muttering.The raider captain paused in midboast, set down his tankard, and turned to hisking. “You told me to go out and die in battle, King Grieve. I launched raidafter raid and killed at least a hundred weaklings by my own hand. I will die asyou commanded, but I don’t intend to die until I’ve killed a lot more.”The other Norukai cheered at his bravado, but Grieve did not seem amused. “Youare still a coward for your failure at Renda Bay. You must atone to the serpentgod for being defeated by mere walking meat.”Lars’s cheeks flushed red with embarrassment. “I understand, my king, and I willmake them pay. I would not have returned here had I not needed provisions andcrew. Countless more serpent ships have been constructed, in preparation. If youwant me to leave the entire coast in flames, then I require more ships.” Helifted his tankard in a toast. The Norukai roared.“We have more ships,” Grieve said. “Chalk’s visions promised we would have moreships.” He stared down at his empty plate.The servants carrying the steaming goat carcass hurried forward and settled theends of the spit into the forked branches of the stand. The roasted animalwafted a savory aroma that filled the hall, briefly overwhelming the stench ofso many unwashed and bloodstained warriors. Grieve grimaced.Bannon carried his urn of preserved fish and purposely set it in front of Larswithout comment. The Norukai captain leaned forward and inhaled deeply, thenbelched. “Perfect for the next course.” He looked up at Bannon, met his eyes,and hesitated. The young man waited for him to explode with recognition, butLars said only, “You are ugly.”Lars reached into the urn with his hand and scooped out the top gobbets ofgelatinous fish. Bannon’s wad of spit was indistinguishable from the mess, andLars slurped it with a grunt of satisfaction.Platters of fish were served at the head table, but King Grieve ignored them,apparently without an appetite. Atta hungrily regarded the goat carcass whileeveryone waited for the king to make the first move. Finally, Atta took theking’s plate and stood. “It is my pleasure to serve you, Grieve. And you canservice me with pleasure later.” With her dagger, she stabbed the steaminghaunch and carved out a portion of rare meat, which she added to the plate. Sheset it in front of him before she served herself a similar amount, then sat downand fell to eating beside him.Grieve finally began eating, although he didn’t seem to taste the meat, didn’tenjoy the celebration. “Soon we go to war,” he said, and by the tone of hisvoice, that was the only thing he looked forward to.Lila entered with her pitcher of wine, unrecognizable in her loose wool dress.She walked with confidence, as if she had already defeated every single personin the room. She came stiffly forward and poured wine into Grieve’s goblet. Hedully drained half of the wine in a single gulp, ignoring her. As she turned tofill Atta’s goblet, clearly resenting the effort, Grieve lashed out in his angrysorrow, shoving Lila away. He didn’t even seem to know what he was doing in hisred misery, but Lila lurched, and half of the wine pitcher poured down on Atta.The Norukai woman exploded. Like a viper striking, she lurched to her feet,knocking her platter aside and dumping the goat meat on the floor. Lila reactedwith morazeth reflexes to defend herself. She dropped the brass pitcher, whichclanged on the flagstone floor and spilled the red wine like blood. Atta pulledback her fist, and the muscles in her meaty arm bulged.Bannon pushed forward to help, frantic to save her, but Lila needed no help.Her hand flashed up and caught Atta’s fist as it slammed toward her. The Norukaiwoman strained, her muscles bulging as Lila thwarted her blow. Atta glowered,pressed, while Lila gritted her teeth and pushed back. She whispered throughclenched teeth, “It was an accident.” She flashed a glance at Grieve, whoremained ignorant of what he had instinctively done. She turned back to Atta. “Iam . . . sorry.” It sounded as if the words were ripped from her throat.With a heave of effort, Atta snatched her fist away. “An accident!”Before Lila could move, the anvil-faced woman struck her across the cheek. Lilacaught herself, coiled, but forced herself not to hit back. She said in an icyvoice, “I am a morazeth. You have my apology, and that is all you will get.”Grieve finally took notice. He stood up and punched Lila on the side of the headso that she buckled to the floor. Atta loomed over her. “I give you a deathsentence too, but just as Grieve did with Lars, I can take a long time to killyou.”“Do your best,” Lila retorted.At the entrance to the banquet hall, Emmett and several slaves hurried in withbaskets of bread and trays of roasted and smoked fish as well as bowls ofpickled saltweed. “Next course!” the old man said, distracting them. “There’smore food to come, and countless desserts.”Emmett limped to the head table as the gathered raiders anticipated the secondround of food. Moving deftly despite his limp, the old man maneuvered among thetables and took the stunned Lila by the elbow. “Come, don’t just rest there! Youhave work to do in the kitchens.” He also hooked Bannon’s arm and escorted themboth away. “Quick! We dare not make King Grieve wait.”While Atta continued her murderous stare, Emmett ushered the two into theshadowy corridors and whatever small safety the kitchens could offer.*Over the next few days as the slave staff in the Bastion kept their heads downand continued their duties, Atta singled out Lila for torment. The Norukai womanfound ways to confront her in the corridors and slam her against the wall in anattempt to provoke her. “Go on, fight me and I will kill you!”Bannon tried to intercede. “Stop! We’re just doing our tasks.”“This one’s task is to die.” Atta pressed her face closer to Lila. “Grieve is mylover. I know you want him.”“I want him dead,” Lila said, “but if I have to kill you first, that would befine with me.”Bannon whispered quickly, “If you kill Atta, the king will murder you himself.”Lila disagreed, and loudly. “If I kill her, then the king will laugh because sheis weak.” She challenged Atta directly. “Do you wish me to fight you? Give me aweapon and we’ll see who walks away.”With a meaty hand Atta slammed her into the wall. “I will give you nothing, noteven death. Not yet.” The Norukai woman stalked off, but Lila remained standing.She plucked at her loose woolen garment as if it offended her.She and Bannon worked together whenever possible. Emmett helped them by givingthem similar assignments, but when the Norukai realized the two were closecompanions, the workmasters forcibly separated them. Still, Lila managed to meetwith Bannon often enough, and together they looked for any opportunity to escapethe Bastion. But with so many armored and angry Norukai crowding the fortress,they found no possibilities.“Old Emmett knows every corner of the Bastion,” Bannon said. “He could help usescape.”Lila was skeptical. “After so much time here, he doesn’t even remember freedom.He only remembers to be afraid for his own life.” She shook her head. “Ipromised to rescue you, and I will find a way.”“And I promised to fight at your side. You trained me to face combat bears andsand panthers. I can handle a few Norukai in a fair fight.”Lila smiled. “You have potential after all, boy.”*The next day, while Lila was tending a cauldron of boiling fish stew, Attabarged into the kitchens, raising her nose to the air. “It is midday. KingGrieve is hungry.” She stalked over to Lila at the large soup pot, sniffingloudly. “Something smells bad. I thought it was the cooking.” She sniffed again.“But it’s merely the stench of this vermin.”She grabbed the iron ladle, pulled up a brimming scoop, and slurped it whileLila glared. Then Atta purposefully poured the scalding liquid on Lila’sshoulder where the bare skin showed from her garment’s ragged neck hole. Themorazeth flinched, but let out no sound of pain as the hot soup dripped down herarm. She just glared defiantly, enduring the burn.Emmett hustled forward with his lurching gait. “Please, Atta! Don’t kill mystaff. King Grieve told you not to kill the staff.”“I didn’t promise not to damage them.” Atta looked at the healing bruises onLila’s face, the fresh red scald mark on her shoulder. Satisfied for the moment,she left the kitchens.Bannon ran over to Lila with a washrag soaked in cool water and pressed itagainst her burned skin. Now that Atta was gone, she let herself wince.Emmett shuffled his feet, and Bannon rounded on him. “This is why you must helpus escape! We’ve got to find a way.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 54 [part0003.html#a7]Nicci was devastated to hear the news from General Linden. She realized onlythen how much she had been counting on Richard and the D’Haran army. “What doyou mean he’s not sending troops? Did I not convey the threat of the ancientarmy, of the Norukai fleet?”“Yes, of course, Sorceress,” Linden said as he nervously shuffled the papers infront of him. “Lord Rahl says he can’t spare the army right now, and besides,such an army would never reach you in time.”Nicci paced off a short distance as she struggled to control her worry over howserious the situation was. She knew Richard. She knew him perhaps better thananyone other than Kahlan. Richard would know that she would ask for that kind ofhelp only if she was desperate. And, she also knew that Richard wouldn’t turnher down unless it was impossible for him to help her. Now, she had the addedconcern of what kind of problem Richard had on his hands, but she also realizedthat it was now her responsibility to defend Tanimura and the other cities inthe south. Richard was putting his trust in her.She turned back to Linden, her focus shifting. “Richard wouldn’t have left it atthat. He must have said something else.”Linden nodded as he pulled open one of the drawers in his desk. He gave her ashaky smile. From the desk drawer, he retrieved a leather-wrapped parcel. “Hedid. He sent this.” He placed the package on the desktop. “He said you wouldknow what to do with it.”Nicci cautiously unfolded the leather, worried about what message she wouldfind. To her surprise, instead of a message, she found only a bone box in theleather pouch, a cube barely an inch on a side.As she turned the cube in her fingers, studying it more thoroughly, she realizedthat, despite its size, this was an object of great importance.“We were afraid to open the box, Sorceress.” Linden was intent and curious.“What is it?”With her nail, she found a crack on the top edge and worked it open to reveal acavity inside the box. The small cube held a floating, rotating orb of light nolarger than a pea. The glowing sphere was lit from within by a network of faintlines and tiny sparks of light.She recognized what it was, which only deepened her concentration. “It is anewly constructed spell.”Probing with her gift, she was able to recognize that this compact nugget hadthe same type of power as the original magic from the design of the Wizard’sKeep, something that only Richard would understand. She realized that the spellwas somehow keyed to the actual, ancient defensive nature of the Keep itself.Linden looked on, his face full of questions.“Whatever it is, Lord Rahl must mean for it to help defend us,” Nicci said. “Tohelp me.” Still looking for answers, she felt inside the leather pouch again,but there was definitely no other message from Richard, no clue. She would haveto figure this out for herself. The message must be on the bone box itself.She closed the lid again, snapping it into place to hide the glowing pearl ofthe spell. The hard white sides of the cube bore fine etchings, lines, designs,and inscribed symbols. At first she couldn’t read them, but then she recognizedthe language of Creation—which Richard understood, and he knew that Nicci alsounderstood. Here was her message!She knew that if General Linden or the courier had opened the pouch and lookedat it, and she assumed they had, they wouldn’t have known what those symbolswere or what they could mean. Only those who could read the ancient language ofCreation would be able to read those emblems and open such a box.She also knew that only Richard could have made it, and Richard would know thatno one but Nicci would be able to decipher those symbols. Until she couldtranslate them, she could only wonder at the ancient power those symbolsprotected.Richard would not have used spells in the language of Creation unless whateverwas inside was both profoundly important and profoundly dangerous. This waspersonal, from Richard to no one else but Nicci. As she stared at the small bonebox in her hand, she had to take a steadying breath at the connection to Richardshe was holding. It was almost as if he was whispering a solution to her.But what solution?After long concentration and working through the symbols until she could readthe markings, she still did not understand the answer. Life to the living. Deathto the dead. How was she supposed to use that?Nicci was mystified. With the stakes so high, why didn’t Richard just explainclearly? She had told him about the enormous threat of the reawakened army. Shehad counted on Richard, needed Richard’s wisdom and strength, and now she wasupset that he hadn’t given her a plain answer.Linden was smiling tentatively at her, hoping for good news. Distracted by thepuzzle, she issued brusque orders for what she needed now. “I have to ignite averification web to see what sort of constructed spell Richard created. I needspace to work, an empty room where I won’t be disturbed.”Linden jumped up from his desk and called soldiers. In only a few moments, theyhad pulled and scraped chairs from a meeting room down the hall. Nicci followedthem into the empty chamber, preoccupied with her own investigation.She knew she needed to do more than a standard verification web on this bonebox, but rather an aspect analysis of a verification web from an interiorperspective. That would allow her to examine the constructed spell down to itscore element. She steeled herself, realizing that casting the web would requireher to use Subtractive Magic. She had no other choice.Nicci stood inside the large empty room in the garrison headquarters and lookedaround the whitewashed walls, the wooden floor. Linden and the soldiers waitedeagerly just outside the door. “This place will do,” she said, looking down atthe tiny box. “Make sure I am not disturbed as I work. Much depends on what Ilearn here.”Fascinated by the enigma of the constructed spell, she paid no attention to thesoldiers, who retreated farther from the door.Using one of the daggers at her hip, she slashed her palm, interested only inthe blood that welled up. She would need a lot of it.Standing in the middle of the wooden floor, she used the dripping blood to drawa careful Grace across the boards. The Grace was a powerful device, and drawn inblood under only the rarest of circumstances, but Nicci needed that power now.An inner and outer circle represented the underworld and the world of theliving, separated by a square, and then at the center an eight-pointed starindicated the Creator’s light, which radiated lines throughout the Grace. Theentire process of drawing the complex symbol took her the better part of anhour.When she was ready, Nicci stood in the center of the magic-infused emblem on thefloor. Closing her eyes, she held the bone box in her intact palm, while shelifted the small lid with the other. Then she opened herself to her power.Surrounded by her thoughts, keeping her eyes closed, Nicci felt nothing otherthan a kind of weightlessness. She drifted, searching, probing, and reached outwith a verification web in search of answers.Only when Nicci opened her eyes did she realize that she was floating uprightand frozen in midair, drifting and slowly rotating several feet off the floorabove the blood-drawn Grace. Through the open door to the room, she saw Lindenand the curious soldiers watching her, astonished, but they were as still asstatues. She heard not a whisper of air, couldn’t even hear her own heartbeat inher ears. As she floated, life itself seemed to be suspended.Extending her sight further, she saw that she was surrounded by lines of glowinggreen light that formed an intricate geometric framework tangled around her.Nicci herself was the living core of a verification web for a constructed spell.Shifting her head, she also realized that one of her feet was suspended over theGrace’s outer circle that represented the underworld.Still not understanding, Nicci used her gift to ignite the verification web, asshe had planned. She stretched out, studying all the glowing lines in the airrising from the Grace, ensnaring her own body and the glowing pearl inside thebone box.But the web offered no answers. No matter how hard Nicci tried, the magic gaveher only a blank response, and the constructed spell’s mysterious purposeremained a complete cipher. Richard’s intent was no clearer than it was before.Frustrated, she withdrew her power and shut down the web, extinguishing thelines of light. They retracted back into the glowing orb inside the bone box.Gently, she drifted back down to the floor and felt solid wood beneath her feet,but her mind still seemed disconnected. She stood still, regaining her balancefor a frozen moment.Out in the corridor, Linden and the soldiers were too hesitant to offer help.After wiping her bleeding palm on her black dress, Nicci snapped the box closedagain and pocketed it. She was profoundly heartbroken that whatever Richard hadsent seemed useless, or at least incomprehensible. She had hoped for a miracle.Now she had to solve it herself.General Linden cleared his throat. “What did you discover, Sorceress? Do youunderstand the weapon Lord Rahl sent for us?”She turned her cold blue eyes toward him. “I fear we are doomed.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 55 [part0003.html#a7]The wave of rock was like a petrified tide that buried his front ranks, allthose loyal fighters who had continued to follow him even though they had losteverything else. Utros stared at the fresh uneven rock that covered the canyonfloor, searching for words. Finally, he said, “Our destiny is permanentlywrapped in stone.”Ruva raged beside him, a roiling mass of barely constrained magic. “Those mengave their lives for you, beloved Utros. They know you will not falter. Theyknow you will conquer the world, as you swore to do.” She looked at the bodiespartially imprisoned in stone. “And their sacrifice will help you achieve thatgoal.”“How?” Utros snarled at her. “How does this help me?” He looked at thedevastation, the massacre.The fallen canyon wall had hardened like a mudslide baked in the hot sun,studded with thousands of corpses like insects caught in pitch. His soldiers hadworn the best armor; their swords were sharp, their training was excellent, andthey could fight against any enemy—but how could they prepare for this? Armsthrust upward still clutching swords, gauntlets and booted feet protruding inthe air with the rest of the bodies drowned under rock.One man’s head, his helmet askew, grimaced and gasped. The rest of his body wassubmerged in the stone; though he could still breathe, he was trapped, crushed.His mouth opened and closed, and his eyes bulged as he tried to sip air. Thedying soldier couldn’t even form words; he had no room left in his chest. Hisgaunt face turned blue as he suffocated, little by little.Utros leaned over him. “I can do nothing to help you.” His heart wrenched withvengeance and sadness. “I am grateful for your service and sorry for yoursacrifice.” He drew his sword. “This is all I can offer.” He struck off theman’s head, leaving a stump that spouted blood from the rim of stone.He would order his soldiers to do the same to any other hopelessly trappedwarriors. It was the right thing to do, but it made him sick.Only by a miracle was he still alive. When the canyon first began to melt, Ruvaand Ava had saved him, blocked him. After the defenders made their stand at thebottleneck, the general’s soldiers had still pushed past the swarm of poisonousscorpions, the spike-filled pits, the camouflage curtain that hid the canyonitself. Nathan and the other gifted fighters had battled and retreated, battledand retreated, luring them farther inside.Utros had been fooled, thinking that the rebels had only that one last line ofdefense. His army had believed in their victory as soon as they saw the cliffalcove filled with archive buildings, and Ruva had hissed with anticipation ofall the powerful knowledge stored here.His army had charged forward in a frenzy, and Utros could not have stopped themif he’d tried. They surged into the hidden canyon, like a rider giving free reinto a spirited horse. Though he wanted to be at the front of the troops, Ruvaforced him to stay back. The starving soldiers fell upon the orchards andfields. They ran down the flocks of terrified sheep and tore them to pieces,eating the creatures raw. Before he could revel in his victory, Ruva sensed theresonance of an incredibly powerful spell . . . and then the cliffs flowed in amolten avalanche.Ava’s shimmering spirit had swooped in front of him, frantic. “Away! It is notsafe! A massive spell! I tried to stop her, General!”Ruva mirrored her twin’s motions and used her gift to bowl Utros back againstthe rocks of the bottleneck as the wave of stone roared down on the front ranksof his army. Killing so many!Now as he viewed the stark aftermath, the general tried to guess how many moreof his soldiers were dead, additional numbers to add to the tally. Fortunately,the bulk of the ancient army had not even entered the hidden canyon and milledoutside in the high desert, ninety thousand or more.First Commander Enoch rode up, his face ashen as he stared across the rippledstone, countless embedded bodies, grasping hands, horrorstruck dead faces. Hecleared his throat as if to spit out the harsh words he needed to say. “TheKeeper claimed many more, sir. He knows us, and he wants us all.”“The Keeper will have to be satisfied for now,” Utros said. “This is enough!”Ava shimmered in front of them, her expression distraught. “He tugs me withgreater strength. He wants my sister. He wants me!”Ruva chimed in, “Thanks to our loyalty to you, beloved Utros, we have thestrength to resist him. Loyalty is stronger than love.” She narrowed her eyes.“Loyalty is stronger than death.”Getting down to business, Enoch said, “We killed a sheep, sir, and we will roastit to feed all the prominent commanders, but the other soldiers still feel as ifthey’re starving.”“Because they are starving,” Utros said. “Even if they still move and march.”Ruva sounded defensive. “No! Our spell maintains them. They keep going even withthe hunger inside. They will live until they are nothing more than walkingbones!”Utros watched in disgust as his soldiers spread out like scuttling beetles. Theystripped the leaves and tender branches from the orchards, gobbling any fruitthey found, ransacking gardens, breaking into the cliffside dwellings toscrounge even the smallest crumbs.Far worse, though it did not surprise him knowing how desperate the preservationspell was, he watched the gaunt warriors race across the hardened stone, findingdead or dying soldiers that had been trapped. They did not try to rescue theircomrades, did not look for survivors. Rather, they seized any hand or leg orface protruding from the rock and tore away strips of flesh, ripping the meatclean as they ate whatever remained of the bodies. They cracked the bones andsucked the marrow, lapped at the blood and gnawed any scrap of skin, muscle, ortendon, and moved on in search of more.Ava shimmered before them and watched. “They need the nourishment. They willsustain themselves in any way they can. And they will continue to be yourfighters.”Ruva explained that the preservation spell could hold the army for only so long.“Any food they find—” She paused and said in a harder voice to emphasize herpoint, “Any food will provide energy to keep them going.”Thinking of his legend, his honor, Utros felt sick. “What is becoming of myarmy? What is becoming of me?” He summoned his resolve, focused on the end goal,his reason for existence after so many centuries. “We will pay any price. Wemade that decision long ago, and it is too late to change now.” He strode pastthe mangled remnants of his lost soldiers to look up at the sheer cliff that wasnow an impenetrable barrier. The Cliffwall archive was completely gone.“They destroyed all that lore.” He looked to the spirit of Ava. “Can you salvageanything? Pass through the rock in your spectral form and find a single scroll,a lone volume? Anything at all?”Her intangible spirit flickered. “It is not possible. The books themselves areencased in stone. The scrolls are petrified.” As she folded herself on top ofRuva, both twins said, “They eradicated the knowledge rather than let us haveit.”Enoch said, “Such desperation shows how much they must fear us.”Utros nodded. “It was a wise tactical move. I would have liked for Ruva to havethat magic as a powerful weapon for my cause, but we do not need it.” He raisedhis voice so the other soldiers could hear him. “Don’t ever believe we need acrutch like that! My army is sufficient.”A few vengeful soldiers picked their way to the far end of the canyon in hopesof catching the defenders who had fled into the highland wilderness, but Utrosknew that Nathan and the others would be long gone.“Tonight we feast on what we have,” he said, “but we dare not rest for long. Wemust keep the army moving. Our goal is to reach the western sea and conquer anycities in between. The Norukai will already be ransacking the coast. King Grieveis engaged in the war.” He turned so that the sunlight flashed on his goldenhalf mask. “My war.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 56 [part0003.html#a7]The following day, the Bastion rang with excitement, and the Norukai rushed downto the sheltered harbor. “The war fleet has returned!” a guard shouted throughthe halls, causing the raiders to celebrate. The slaves received the newswithout enthusiasm.From the upper tower, Bannon and Lila looked through an open window to seedozens of serpent ships sailing in. Bannon lost count after fifty.Lila realized what they were. “They are the rest of the damaged raiding vesselsfrom the river below Ildakar. The construction crews finished repairing them.”Bannon had not forgotten the battered vessels. The Norukai shipwrights wouldhave worked the slaves day and night, until they were ready to set sail. Now inaddition to Lars’s raiding fleet and the hundred new serpent ships that had beenconstructed in King Grieve’s absence, these vessels swelled the Norukai navy toan unstoppable force. They would ravage the entire coast.“Sweet Sea Mother! We have to get away! It’s more important than ever,” Bannonsaid. “We’ve got to warn people that these attacks are coming. How will they beable to defend themselves?”“It’s now more important than ever, but our chances of escape are even worse,”Lila said. “There will be twice as many Norukai in the Bastion, watching usevery moment.”Bannon saw the newly repaired ships approach like a pack of wolves closing in ona wounded stag. Some vessels anchored at the outlying islands in thearchipelago, while others docked directly below the Bastion. Those crews wouldbe ready for wild revels and war preparations.As he thought about it, he smiled slowly. “I disagree, Lila. Our chances justgot better! Think of the drunken celebrations. The Bastion will be in completechaos, and the slaves will be ordered about on countless tasks. Who will keeptrack of it all? Who will be watching us, in particular? Would even Atta botherharassing you?”Frowning, Lila winced from her swollen bruises, the healing burn on hershoulder. “We might have our opportunity, but we don’t have the resources. Wherewould we go?”“If we could slip out of the Bastion, we will hide somewhere.”Lila was not convinced. “Then what? We would still be trapped on the island andsurrounded by serpent ships.”“Emmett has to help us.” Bannon knew it was the only answer.As new arrivals piled into the Bastion, the old kitchen servant was paralyzedwith the responsibility and fear of reprisal if the banquet wasn’t perfect. Thereturning captains barged into the great fortress, filling the reception halland throne chamber where Grieve received their reports.The king remained sullen after the loss of Chalk, but his rage had galvanizedhim. When the repaired ships returned from Ildakar, he was convinced that theonly way to purge his sorrow was to devastate the Old World.In the midst of the clamor in the kitchen, all ovens were stoked to bake bread,loaf after loaf that filled wooden handcarts. The larders were nearly emptied,but fortunately Lars had brought back supplies from his raids.Emmett and his staff still had to prepare the food. Slaves hurried about, andthe limping old veteran did his best to manage them. The well-trained slaves didtheir duties, but the newer recruits often dropped platters or spilled tureens.With Lila beside him, Bannon cornered Emmett just outside the kitchen. “This isour chance. The Norukai will be drunk, loud, and unruly. You can help usescape.”The old man’s blank stare melted into surprise, then horror. “You can’t escape.They’ll kill you!” He stuttered, “I-I can’t lose two slaves. The Norukai need tobe served. King Grieve has commanded it.”“King Grieve should not be your master,” Lila said. “You saw the warships thatjust arrived, and you know the fleet he is building. We must get away to soundthe alarm up and down the coast, and this may be our last chance.”“It isn’t only so we can save ourselves,” Bannon said. “Just get us a boat, evena small one, and we will sail away. We’ll find the mainland, get the cities andvillages to prepare their defenses. The people have to know that a war is comingtheir way. Think of how many innocents will be slaughtered.”Emmett looked distraught. “I know what King Grieve intends to do. I’ve been herefor a decade. Alas, I may be the only person from my village who remains alive.”“There will be countless villages like yours once those raids launch,” Bannonsaid. “We can save some of them, but only if you help us get away.”“I . . . I don’t know how. If I knew, I would have left here long ago.” His thinvoice cracked.“Are you sure about that?” Lila said in a low voice. “Would you have been braveenough to escape on your own?”Emmett fumbled with his ponytail, wrapping his fingers around the gray hair.“No, I-I don’t think so.”“But you can help us!” Bannon insisted, then dropped his voice to a hush again.“It will be days before they realize we’re gone, if they notice at all. KingGrieve could never connect you to our escape. Sweet Sea Mother, please!”Emmett struggled with his conscience, flexing and unflexing his fingers. Hiswrinkled face was seamed with sorrow, and as Bannon silently pleaded, he sawsomething break inside the old man. “I-I do know of a way down to the waterline.It’s steep and rarely used, a small rock jetty, but I think you’ll find a boatthere. Some of the Norukai spearfish in the narrow coves.”“That’s a start,” Bannon said without thinking.“We will make do,” Lila agreed.Perspiration sparkled on Emmett’s forehead as he looked from side to side. Hehunched his shoulders as he hobbled along a corridor, leaving the mayhem of thekitchens. “Come with me! We won’t have much time.”They took a side corridor, then worked their way down a narrow set of stonesteps that were slimy with moss. They descended steeply, running fingers alongthe wall to keep their balance. The veteran slave looked behind him often,stared longingly up the stairs as if desperate to get back to his duties. Hewinced with pain as he limped along on his poorly set leg.Bannon would not turn down any chance to escape, but he realized that if he andLila were going to sail off in a small boat, they had no water, no food, noclothing or blankets, not even any charts. They could rush back to the kitchens,grab some supplies. . . . No, he shook those thoughts away. This was their firstopportunity to escape, and if he and Lila died out on the open water, at leastthey would die with some semblance of freedom.The tortured staircase turned again and spilled them out onto a wider landingwhere daylight flooded through a small barred gate. Bannon drew in a deep breathof the fresh, salt air that replaced the dankness. Outside, he could hear wavescrashing on the rocks.He worked the gate’s metal latch. Caked with salt and rust, the hinges groanedin protest, but he and Lila managed to swing the gate open, to freedom.A stone jetty extended into the choppy surf, and two small boats were tied tothe pilings. One was rotten and half full of water from the crashing spray, butthe other was a fishing boat large enough to take two or three people and a haulof fish. It had a single mast and a roll of gray sailcloth tucked against thebow under the front gunwale. A pair of oars rested in the bottom of the boat.Bannon controlled his disappointment. “I had hoped for something better, but Iexpected nothing less.”Lila said, “We will cross the ocean in a rowboat if we need to.”“You’ll need to,” Emmett said.Bannon clung to a shred of optimism. “Two people can sail this boat. We willmake it work.”Emmett squirmed, desperate to bolt back inside before the Norukai noticed hisabsence. Bannon looked at him, thought of the innumerable years of captivity theold man had suffered. “Come with us, Emmett. Escape! We’ll all survivetogether.”The old man was taken aback by the suggestion. “N-No, I couldn’t. I don’t dare.”“You will never get away from King Grieve unless you come with us now,” Lilasaid. In disgust, she yanked at the ragged neck of her wool garment, tore it,then flung the shapeless dress away. She stood proud, clad as a morazeth again.The old slave struggled with his decision, but shook his head. “I can’t! All ofthe other slaves . . .”“All of the other slaves would also escape if they could. This is your chance!I’m begging you, Emmett,” Bannon said.But the old man was too frightened. “Go.” He waved them off. “Don’t waste youropportunity. I-I wasted mine long ago. Now I continue to serve.” He swallowedhard. “Until I die.”“Until you die,” Bannon said. It sounded like a prophecy.Lila had no further patience. “Here’s the boat, boy. The celebrations aregetting louder. The Norukai are intoxicated, and night is falling. If we are tohave any chance, it is now.”Bannon climbed aboard the battered fishing boat, giving a last glance back atthe gate, but Emmett had already limped back inside, pulled the bars closedagain, and vanished into the shadows.Lila sprang into the boat with perfect grace. “You know how to sail, boy. Takeus away from here.”Bannon undid the ropes on the piling and used one of the oars to push them awayfrom the jetty. Rowing carefully, he dodged the first line of rocks and sprayingwaves, then worked his way into the open water. He looked at the towering blackBastion behind them and shuddered as they headed out to the open sea."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57 [part0003.html#a7]Because she would stay in Tanimura to help build the city’s defenses, Niccifound temporary quarters in the main barracks at the garrison. It was only asmall room with a narrow bunk and a writing desk, but it was sufficient for herneeds.General Linden stood at the door after escorting her to the room, still nervousafter having seen her work with the Grace and the verification web. “I wish Ihad more appropriate accommodations, but the garrison has swelled with newarrivals, visiting commanders, and volunteers from the city guard.” He fidgetedat the door. “Tomorrow, I will have my adjutant secure a more spacious room foryou in one of the boardinghouses.”“I don’t require extravagance, General. I just spent several days aboard akraken-hunter ship.” She inhaled deeply, smelled the fresh wood, the cleanbedding. “This is a great improvement.”Linden wrinkled his nose. “I thought I smelled something a little off. Now Iknow what it was.”“I’ve had little rest since I first arrived in Serrimundi, and I will sleep wellhere.” She felt disappointingly washed out, her strength diluted. Nicci’s giftwas her greatest weapon, and just as a soldier needed to sharpen his swordbefore going into battle, she needed to recover her strength.General Linden gave a quick bow and closed the door, leaving her in the room.Alone and calm, Nicci allowed herself to relax, if only a little. She couldnever relax entirely, but she needed the rest and the strength.Before attempting to sleep, knowing the questions would worry her throughout thenight, Nicci again took out the small bone box from Richard. She opened the lid,probed it with her gift, but the answers still eluded her. Her sense offrustration increased. Why would Richard send such a cryptic message? Why notjust a straightforward answer? This was not a time for games! She had been clearabout the incredible threat they faced. If Utros and the Norukai raidersconquered the Old World, they would surely push northward into D’Hara.Yet Richard’s response had been . . . this?She set the open bone box on the wool blanket and bent close to the rotatingpearl of energy. She could smell the faint metallic crackle in the air. What didRichard want her to do with it? Why would he assume she could understand themessage, even if she did read the language of Creation? After so many years ofher being close to him, she and Richard were so tightly connected that Nicciknew his thoughts, his heart. She had been in love with him for a long time, butwhen she accepted his undying devotion to Kahlan, she resolved to become thesecond-most-important person in his life. Nicci believed she had achieved that.Her powers were greater than those of any other sorceress. Along with Nathan,her vital mission was to tame the Old World in the name of the D’Haran Empire.But she knew Richard. She understood how his mind worked. She could oftenanticipate his thoughts and actions, and he understood Nicci with equalalacrity.By sending this strange message, Richard knew that this was something she, andonly she, would understand. It was a solution, if she could decipher it. “Thisobject is all I need,” she reminded herself, still perplexed. “It holds the keysomehow.” He was counting on her. She stared at the bone box, trying to find themissing piece, to understand how she could use this enigmatic constructed spell.After about an hour, she gave up. Too exhausted to think about it anymore, Nicciknew her thoughts would be clearer after a good rest. She closed the box andpocketed it, then lay back on her bed, worried that her churning thoughts wouldkeep her awake. But moments after closing her blue eyes, she fell into a deepslumber.In the calm emptiness of a dream state, Nicci’s thoughts stretched over vastdistances, and she was surprised to connect with her sister panther again! Shelooked through Mrra’s sharp feline eyes. Nicci had unwillingly been whisked awayfrom the battle in Orogang, and now she was overjoyed to know the big cat wasstill alive. Considering the bloodthirsty ancient army in the abandoned capital,she feared that Mrra and the Hidden People had been massacred, though she knewthey would have fought to the last. But her sand panther had escaped somehow.Now, through her dream connection, Nicci knew that Mrra was running overland,loping along the hills and forests to get back to her. Because of the sliph,they were separated by a great distance. She could feel her sister panther’sweariness, the sore pads of her enormous paws, but Mrra kept coming.Through the animal’s predatory senses, she realized that the big cat was notalone. Other panthers from her new pride accompanied her, and Nicci wasoverjoyed to know that some of the big cats had survived the battle at Orogang.Even as Nicci slept in the Tanimura barracks, she and her sister panther ranalong, linked together. Their bond was strong, and Mrra followed it like animplacable summons. Yes, the panthers were coming! No matter how long or arduousthe journey, across the wilderness, over the mountains, Mrra would find her.With her panther senses, though, Nicci detected something else, and she realizedthat the big cats were not alone. There were other fighters coming to Tanimura,moving at their best speed. Mrra’s focus was not on them, so Nicci could nottell who or what they were, but she knew they were coming.Armies were gathering. . . .When Nicci awoke the next morning, not only was she well rested but she alsofelt a spark of hope, which refreshed her as much as the long rest had."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 58 [part0003.html#a7]While many refugees from Cliffwall scattered into the desert wilderness, Nathanand the surviving defenders headed directly westward, anxious to reach the coastin time to prepare the major cities for war. They pushed themselves hard,knowing they had to stay ahead of General Utros’s army.Their group passed small farming settlements, intrepid villagers who had comeback to reclaim all the land that had once been drained by the Lifedrinker.Nathan’s heart ached when their group paused one night to water their horses andbeg food from a group of pioneer families. The settlers had established afoothold, tilling the land, planting crops, building a few homes and even aschoolhouse near a stream. Four milk cows were penned in a stockade, and thecattle lowed as their group approached. The villagers came out, suspicious ofthe large armed party of strangers.Sitting tall on his own horse next to Nathan, Oron said in a low voice, “Theythink we are an army.”“They will not welcome the news we bring.” Nathan stroked his chin.The pioneer families gathered in the falling darkness to face the riders. Abearded farmer in a wide-brimmed leather hat stepped forward. “We have littlefor you to take, if you mean to raid our lands.”General Zimmer pulled his horse to a halt at the head of the party. “We mean youno harm, though we bring you a warning. A large enemy army is marching behindus, a hundred thousand strong. They will take everything you have, and you can’tstop them.”From his own horse, Nathan leaned forward and said, “Pack up your things and runto the hills if you value your lives.”The farmer families were dismayed. “But we can’t abandon our homes! We justbuilt this village, now that the Lifedrinker is dead.”Nathan straightened his rumpled cape. “I know. I saw what this valley was likebefore, but you can rebuild again. Please, heed what we have to say. Don’t leavea scrap of food for the enemy. Go hide in the forests for a few days.” He knewhis words were hard. “When they are gone, you can start over, but at leastyou’ll be alive.”The bearded farmer looked angry. “Who are you to tell us this? Why did you lurean army here?”General Zimmer said, “The army will come, whether we are here or not. GeneralUtros is on his way.”Thorn and Lyesse, who jogged along with the group, said, “We are killing as manyas we can, but it will take a long time to wipe them all out.”The horses drank from the stream. Nathan knelt on the soft bank, cupped therunning water, and brought it to his lips. The worried farmer families hadlittle food to spare, and the retreating defenders took nothing more than wasoffered. General Zimmer led the party onward as the alarmed settlers scurriedabout, packing what they could.As the group covered mile after mile, Nathan felt an eerie sense of familiarityto retrace his journey from when he, Bannon, and Nicci had traveled inland.Similarly, Oliver and Peretta rode together on their horse, pointing outlandmarks they remembered from their own journey to Tanimura. Next to them,Amber looked ahead, wistful. “In a week we’ll be in Renda Bay, won’t we,General? My brother will help us. I’m sure he’s made the town fully defensible.”Zimmer gave the young novice a sad look. “I don’t doubt Captain Norcross hasmade remarkable progress, but I can’t imagine what sort of defenses could stopthe army of General Utros.”Oron snorted, “If all of Ildakar couldn’t defeat them, what hope does a fishingtown have?”“What hope does any of us have?” asked Sister Rhoda. “Even after the prelate’ssacrifice, they are still coming.”“I will not abide talk like that! The hope we have is the hope we make,” Nathansaid. “Gigantic armies have been defeated before, and invincible enemies havefallen. Think of Darken Rahl. Think of the Imperial Order and Emperor Jagang.Think of Sulachan and his hordes of half people. Utros is just another one todefeat, and we will do exactly that!”Taking heart, the group rode onward.Days later, when they crested the last line of hills before descending to theriver valley that led to the ocean, the group stopped and looked back at themany miles they had traveled. Even from a distance they could see the dust andthe trampled subjugated landscape from so many thousands of Utros’s marchingsoldiers.“They are keeping up with us,” Captain Trevor said. “How can they move so fast?”“How can they be alive at all, when they should have died centuries ago?” askedSister Mab.Nathan grimaced as sharp pain shuddered through his chest. His heart pounded asif it meant to burst out of the long scar, and he pressed his palm hard againsthis breastbone. “Leave me alone,” he snapped under his breath, but Ivan’s heartcontinued to pound with the eager anticipation of violence.*As the group followed the widening river toward the coast, they encounteredtrade roads and finally reached the outskirts and pasturelands of Renda Bay. Theclear, sunny morning suggested that all was right with the world. A boy tendingsheep and playful lambs greeted them, amazed to see General Zimmer and thebattle-worn party. The shepherd boy had a mop of dark hair that looked as woollyas the sheep he tended. “Are you going to help us against the Norukai if theycome back?”Amber pushed her horse forward. “Have they come back?”“Once.” The boy’s expression was troubled, then he grinned. “But we fought andwe drove them away!”Amber beamed. “I knew it!”Nathan leaned down from his horse. “Be a good lad and run ahead. Find townleader Thaddeus and tell him we’re coming. We have urgent news.”The boy awkwardly regarded his sheep. “I can’t leave my flock. They’re myresponsibility.”“Your sheep will be fine for a little while. Now run along. Go! Fast as youcan.” The boom of command in the wizard’s voice startled the boy, and he boltedoff, racing down the road to the town.Warm memories of Renda Bay filled Nathan’s heart, enough to eclipse the shadowof Ivan for a time. He felt a fondness for this place, the first town they haddiscovered after he, Nicci, and Bannon were shipwrecked. The people of Renda Bayhad welcomed the castaways, and the three of them had helped defend against ahorrific Norukai raid.Now, riding into the busy town, they wearily raised hands in greeting. Thecurious townspeople came forward to greet them. Resplendent in his D’Haranarmor, Captain Norcross rushed through the streets and came up to presenthimself to General Zimmer. The voices and happy cheers rose to a loud clamor inthe town square. It felt like a grand homecoming.Thaddeus, a bearded, strong-backed fisherman, was soft-spoken but confident.Since the last time Nathan had seen him, the new town leader had grown into hisrole. “Welcome back after your long journey! The shepherd boy said you lookedtired and hungry, and I have already ordered the inn kitchens to prepare food.”He scratched his beard. “After all you’ve done to save this town, I won’t scrimpon our hospitality.” Thaddeus did a double take as he recognized Nathan.“Wizard! I never expected you to come back.”“Yes, I am truly a wizard again. My gift is back . . . and we are all going toneed it.”“Where is Nicci?” The town leader looked around the dusty group of travelers.“And the young swordsman Bannon? He was a whirlwind with his blade. I think hekilled twenty Norukai all by himself.”Nathan frowned. “We were separated.” He gestured back to the group. “But we haveseveral other powerfully gifted individuals with us, and we have much to tell.”No longer able to restrain herself, Amber rushed forward to embrace her brother,who seesawed between wanting to sweep her into a hug and trying to be formal infront of his commander. He managed to splutter, “I relinquish command to you,General. Renda Bay is yours.”Zimmer looked at Norcross. “And we have many preparations to make. I want to seewhat you’ve done while I was away.”Standing at rigid attention, the young officer delivered his report. “The town’sdefenses are in place, and they’ve already proved effective. Only a month ago wedefeated a significant Norukai raid. The slavers ran away from here like beatendogs.” He allowed himself a smile. “They learned their lesson. I doubt theNorukai will come back.”“We have more to worry about than just the Norukai,” said Nathan.Oron rode forward with a sour expression and spoke without introducing himself.“We don’t have much time, perhaps two or three days.”“If we are lucky,” Lady Olgya added.“Two or three days?” Thaddeus asked. “For what?” More townspeople came closer,dreading what they were about to hear.“A gigantic army is on our heels,” Nathan reported. “Nearly a hundred thousandwarriors on a forced march, and Renda Bay is right in their path.”As the people gasped, Zimmer regarded the siege towers that rose on either sideof the bay, the high walls built around the harbor, the impressive defenses thatfaced outward to protect against Norukai attacks. Out in the deeper water, threelarge sailing ships, the vessels that had delivered the D’Haran expeditionaryforce, were anchored and alert.“You have done well to prepare for Norukai raids,” he said, then lowered hisvoice, “but there’s nothing we can do to save Renda Bay from Utros and hisarmy.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 59 [part0003.html#a7]The stolen Norukai boat rocked on the open water as breezes gusted against thesail. Bannon’s hands were sore and blistered from pulling the oars, and Lilaworked just as hard while he rested, but they had both been toughened aboard theserpent ship, and now they rowed for their own salvation.They had escaped the Norukai islands the day before, and they vanished into thethickening night before anyone in the Bastion noticed their absence. The drunkenrevelry faded behind them, along with poor Emmett, who had been brave enough tohelp them escape, but not brave enough to go with them.Sailing off, Bannon didn’t begin to feel hope until full night closed in. NoNorukai ships could follow them in the pitch black. Even Bannon didn’t knowwhere they were going. Their small boat sailed off into the open ocean with nocharts, no food or water. Bannon had only a vague notion of where the mainlandmight lie, but Lila did not doubt him for a moment.When the sun rose the next morning, they searched for any sign of land, or forpursuing serpent ships. Together, they inventoried the items in the boat—a coilof rope, a net, and a bone-tipped spear for fishing. Throughout the day, Lilastabbed into the water with the spear, and after nearly a hundred attempts, sheskewered a fish and flopped it into the boat.“Now we have dinner.” She used the jagged spear to slice open the belly andcarefully removed the entrails. “We need these for the moisture. We will splitthem.”Bannon grimaced at the memories it brought up, but accepted the offering. “We’veeaten worse. Sweet Sea Mother, think of the lessons the Norukai taught us!Eating fish guts, rowing for hours on end. It may be the key to our survival.”Lila sneered as she lifted the spear. “I would show King Grieve my appreciationin person, along with that vile woman Atta.”Bannon forced a laugh. “I will not turn the boat around, even if you insist.”She gave him a perplexed frown. “I was not serious.”“Neither was I. Sometimes you are very difficult to understand.”“My thoughts are perfectly clear. You should make more of an effort.” Lila’sface was discolored with purple and yellow bruises, and Bannon suspected that helooked just as bad with his split lip and bashed eye. They had little time tolook at mirrors in the Bastion.They shared the moist raw fish, and Bannon began to row, while Lila perched withthe spear again, looking for another target to skewer.By the third day they were parched and sunburned, and they still had seen nosign of the mainland or any other island. That afternoon, the only small changeto the monotony was a spreading dark patch in the water, which Bannon recognizedas kelp fronds. He reached down to pull up some of the strands. “The bladdershave liquid inside.” He tugged hard on the slimy green ribbons. Rounded nodulesin the stems were like buoys holding up the main plant.“If you drink the salt water, it will eventually kill you,” Lila warned. “Yourthirst will only get worse.”“No, the water in the bladders is filtered through the kelp skin. It’s strongand tastes terrible, but it is drinkable.” Using his thumbnails, he pressed intothe squishy sphere, cracked open the rind, and peeled it apart. The nodulecontained only a spoonful or two of liquid, which he offered to Lila.She frowned skeptically. “Are you certain?”“Fishermen knew this on Chiriya Island.”“Then why are you giving it to me first? To see if it’s poison?”Bannon was disappointed. “No, because I was being nice.”“Thank you. Sometimes I don’t recognize that.” She drank, grimaced, thenswallowed. “It is as acceptable as the fish guts.”“High praise indeed.” Bannon pulled on the strands of kelp until he foundanother nodule, burst it open, and sucked on the liquid inside. It had a strongiodine tang, and he had to force himself to drink it, but his mouth and throatneeded the water. Using the saw edge of the fishing spear, they cut the kelpstems and loaded the boat with twenty intact nodules while they drifted amongthe seaweed.The kelp provided a habitat for fish, and Lila deftly caught six with her barehands, scooping them out of the water and dropping them into the boat. Bannonrelished the feast. “Thank you, Lila, for everything. You did promise to keep mealive.”“I have not saved you yet, boy.”“I’m alive so far. I count that as a temporary success.”When the waves grew choppy and the wind picked up, the gray clouds thickenedinto what looked like a smoke pudding. The fishing boat moved on at a swifterpace, but Bannon had no idea if they were even going in the right direction. Hehad seen many ocean storms from Chiriya Island, where he and his mother wouldhuddle together in their cottage while his father would rage at the weather,which prevented him from going to the tavern.The sail strained against the wind, and Bannon’s long hair whipped about. Whenthe clouds burst and rain sheeted down, he and Lila welcomed the firstspattering of raindrops. As the rain increased, they turned their faces up tothe sky, letting the droplets wash their salt-encrusted cheeks, opening theirmouths to catch any of the moisture.“We have no containers,” he groaned. “All this rain will be wasted.”“Drink your fill,” she said. Like a baby bird begging for a worm from itsmother, she kept her mouth open and turned her face to the sky.Bannon cupped his palms until he collected a few thimblefuls of water, which heslurped through cracked lips. He repeated the procedure again and again, but hewas frantic to capture and store more rain. Puddles filled the bottom of theboat, but it was filthy water.“We have no pots, no basins, nothing! And all this rain is coming down! SweetSea Mother.”“Your clothes,” Lila said. “Take off your shirt and trousers.”“What?” He touched his already soaked cotton shirt.“Take off your clothes now, boy.” She began tugging at the fabric.In a few moments he sat in only his smallclothes in the open boat. Lila spreadout his shirt and trousers to be soaked by the rain; then she rolled them up ina loose wad. “That will hold some water, at least a few mouthfuls that will lastfor a day or two.” She touched the black leather band across her breasts andaround her waist. “I would do the same, but my garments are inappropriate.” Shefrowned. “Maybe I shouldn’t have thrown my other robe away.”When the winds grew so strong that Bannon feared the sail would rip or thesingle mast would snap in half, they took down the canvas. By folding thefabric, they were able to form pockets that also filled with rainwater.As the storm increased, Bannon wound the rope around himself and Lila, lashingit to the gunwales. “If either of us is thrown overboard, we’re dead. This willkeep us in the boat.”“Unless we capsize,” Lila said. Her spiky brown hair was plastered to her head,and rainwater ran down her bruised face.“It’s a chance we have to take.”The storm lasted for hours, and though Bannon was queasy from the churningwaves, the stolen boat remained intact. And when the rain finally stopped,around midnight, the weather changed to a thick fog. Mist rolled in like aclammy blanket that obscured their view of the horizon, even though there wasnothing to see.He and Lila were drenched and cold, and as the temperature dropped, theirsunburned skin made the deepening chill even more miserable. Bannon saw thatLila was shivering, and he began to shiver, too. Downcast, she said, “I don’tthink we will ever make it to land, Bannon Farmer.” When she intentionally usedhis name, he knew how serious she was. “I may not save you after all, but I didtry.”They were isolated in the impenetrable fog, alone in the wilderness of waves. “Idon’t know where we are or how far we’ve come,” Bannon said, “but I will notgive up, and neither will you. Maybe it’s my turn to save you.”“Our first order of business is to keep warm,” she said, wrapping her armsaround him and pulling him down to the bottom of the boat. As the collectedrainwater sloshed around them, Bannon returned the embrace, drawing her close.Lila pressed as much of her body against his as she could, and Bannon held hertight.“We can share warmth,” he said. “I’ve heard it’s very good for people sufferingfrom extreme chills.”Lila tucked her bruised face against his bare chest. “Yes, I believe it ishelping.”As they lay together, the sound and rocking of the waves soothed them like alullaby. For a while, Bannon forgot that they were lost, and he fell asleep inLila’s arms.The next morning he awoke to hear an odd and unexpected sound, a distant rushingand roaring. He blinked and sat up, disentangling himself from Lila. Themorazeth snapped awake and sat up next to him.“What is that sound?” she asked, as if they might be under attack.The fog had thinned, leaving only a grayish veil that began to dissipate as thesun rose. Even before Bannon saw the coastline, he recognized the sound of wavescrashing against a shore. “That’s it! We found land.” He stood up so quickly herocked the boat. “I don’t know how, but we found the coast. It’s a miracle.”“It won’t be a miracle unless we make it to land,” Lila said.Together they raised the sail and tacked into the breezes that drove them closerto the shore. He remembered being similarly lost and adrift in a small boat offof Chiriya long ago, the fog bank . . .He gazed back out to sea, away from the shoreline. When he shaded his eyes inthe bright morning light, he saw a flicker of humanlike figures on the waves,smooth heads with slitted eyes and wide fang-filled mouths. A flash of fearstruck through him. If the selka attacked now, he and Lila could never fightthem off!But he realized that the selka wouldn’t attack. They had saved him and Lila.Sometime during the night, the sea people must have taken the boat and draggedit close to shore.Lila was too focused on the land to notice the selka. She sat on the gunwale andgrabbed the oars, pulling as hard as she could. When Bannon glanced back again,the selka had disappeared beneath the waves.As they approached the coast, Bannon saw the mouth of a river, a bay, and thebuildings of a large town, as well as numerous fishing boats heading out intothe morning. Bannon yelled and waved, though the harbor was still far away.“We’re saved!”Lila kept pulling on the oars. “We don’t know where we are, but those peoplewill help us. We will warn them about the Norukai fleet that is sure to comesoon.”Bannon continued to watch the boats sailing out of the harbor, then scrutinizedthe buildings in the town. He saw the bridge that crossed the river to span thesmall bay. A flash of recognition suddenly struck him. “I know where we are,Lila.”Already one of the fishing boats had spotted them, and Bannon could see tinyfigures waving. She pulled harder on the oars as the boat headed in theirdirection.“That is Renda Bay,” he said."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 60 [part0003.html#a7]The raucous festivities continued while the raiders prepared for full-scale war,but Chalk was dead. King Grieve sat on his imposing throne surrounded by wildNorukai, but he walled himself off with anger and grief.Chalk was dead!Lars kept feasting, drinking, and boasting, as if the success of his raids meantthat he had been forgiven, but Grieve was not in a forgiving mood. As therevelry continued and the feasting tables were piled high with fish, bread,cliff tubers, and even hams and sausages brought in by recent raids, Grievebarely ate a morsel. His only movement was to clench and unclench his fists,feeling the squares of iron fused onto his knuckles. The scars on his cheeksrippled as he clenched his jaws. He exhaled a long hiss like the serpent god,but no one noticed the sound amid the pounding fists, laughter, and shouts.Chalk was dead! His shaman, his advisor, his friend . . .The repaired serpent ships had returned from Ildakar, fifty-one vesselsremaining out of the hundred that had initially sailed, but they were asthreatening as ever. Those ships, along with Lars’s raiding fleet and more thanseventy new ships, gave the Norukai a powerful navy. If his ally General Utrosfulfilled his promise with his vast army marching to the coast, the two forceswould dominate the Old World. The Norukai people, having been driven off themainland by Emperor Sulachan thousands of years ago, would now have the worldagain. Grieve’s people would rip a gaping wound along the coast.In normal times, he would have relished the thought of blood and violence, butChalk was dead.When the rage reached a boiling point, he lurched to his feet and let out awordless roar that echoed across the room and brought the shouting and revelryto a stuttering halt. The rest of the Norukai looked at him, stunned; then Larsraised his fist and let out a similar roar, as did the other raiders, until thewalls of the Bastion shook with their enthusiasm.But Chalk was still dead.Grieve trudged down the stone steps from his throne to meet the shoutingNorukai. Misinterpreting his mood, some clapped him on the shoulder, pounded hisback, but the king ignored them. At another time he might have punched themsenseless, but now he did not consider them worth his time or his ire.Two slaves brought in another roast goat, a scrawny one this time, because mostof the island’s flock had already been killed. Grieve didn’t like goat anyway.He needed to find a target for his annoyance, but he didn’t know where to start.Prancing at his side, Chalk would have issued quirky and cryptic pronouncements,but why hadn’t the shaman foreseen his own death? He could have saved himself!How could he not have envisioned the attack of the selka, how could he not haveknown their slimy queen would tear him open? He was a poor shaman not to havepredicted something so vital!Or had he seen something after all? Grieve remembered Chalk chattering duringthe sacrifice of the slave on the day before the selka attack: “Serpent god willsave some of us. But I won’t tell which ones!”Had he known after all? Why hadn’t he warned anyone?Grieve wanted to smash a face. He realized that what he really wanted was to gutone of the slaves, so he could watch the victim writhe in agony in a pool ofblood, just the way Chalk had died.Looking up, he saw old Emmett, the wrinkled old man who had been a fixture atthe Bastion even before Grieve had killed his own father. Chalk had encouragedhim to slay King Stern and take the crown. The albino had foreseen it in avision, and he had helped Grieve choose the perfect timing.Why hadn’t Chalk been able to avoid his own death?The axe cleaves the wood. The sword cleaves the bone. What did hispronouncements even mean? Could anyone make sense of them?When Emmett presented a braided pastry filled with chopped nuts, Grieve realizedthat the limping old man seemed more frightened than usual, probably because heand his slaves had been bullied by so many visiting Norukai. Grieve glancedaround the dining hall, still looking for a victim who could alleviate hissadness. He saw neither Bannon nor the morazeth Lila, and he realized he hadn’tseen them for several days during the busy preparations for war.He was surprised that Atta hadn’t killed her supposed female rival by now.Grieve had no sexual interest in the scrawny morazeth, since he would certainlybreak her fragile body if he used her roughly, but now that sounded like a goodidea. Yes, he would eviscerate Bannon, then knock Lila down onto the banquettable and have her there, right in front of all of his men. He could strangleher when he was finished, and that would also please Atta. Maybe that wouldfinally cure him of his malaise.He looked around at the serving slaves, but he didn’t see them.Old Emmett obsequiously offered the nut-filled pastry for him to eat. “You willfind it delicious, my Grieve, a specialty of the kitchens for this celebrationof your impending conquest.”The king knocked the tray out of the slave’s hands and grabbed him by the longponytail as if it were a leash, yanking Emmett’s head back. “Where are Bannonand Lila? I want them here now.”The old man paled. “They are . . . they are on other duties, I’m sure, myGrieve.”Atta had been fawning over Lars, no doubt to make Grieve jealous, and now sheshoved the disgraced captain aside and took her place next to King Grieve. “Yes,where is the skinny bitch? I fancy drowning her in a piss bucket after all thesemen have filled it.” She let out a loud laugh.“Bring them,” Grieve demanded of Emmett. “Now!”The old slave limped off like an injured deer fleeing an oncoming wildfire. Hehid for the better part of an hour, but the impatient king sent several Norukaito drag him back into the banquet hall.Bannon and Lila were nowhere to be found. Guards searched the Bastion andreturned to the king with the infuriating report that they had interrogatedevery slave, but those two had not been seen in some time.“I-I know nothing about it, my Grieve,” Emmett whined, and the obvious terror onthe man’s face turned his words into a lie.Grieve threw the crippled slave down on the table, flat on his back among theplatters. Emmett’s struggles inflamed the Norukai king’s dominance, and heslammed the old man’s head against the wood. With his right hand, he snatchedthe dagger at his waist and plunged it through the tendons of Emmett’s shoulder,skewering him to the table. The wrinkled slave gasped with pain. “I don’t know,my Grieve! I don’t know.”The interrogation continued at length, and Grieve enjoyed the process, more joythan he had felt for many days. By the time he had cut off Emmett’s left ear andtwo fingers at the second knuckle, another Norukai entered the hall to report.“A fishing boat is gone from the jetty, King Grieve. Someone took it!”“No, no!” Emmett whimpered, bleeding from multiple wounds. “Maybe it broke looseand drifted away in a storm.”“Or maybe they stole it and escaped,” Grieve growled.Impatient, he slashed off the old man’s other ear. He pinched the curved rind offlesh between his thumb and forefinger, waggling the ear in front of Emmett’sface. “Tell me what I need to know, or I have many more bits I can slice off.”He waved the dripping trophy again.Finally Emmett broke down, sobbing. Grieve yanked out the knife that pinned theold slave to the table, releasing him. Emmett rolled forward, shuddering andbleeding, then babbled out a stream of words that coalesced into an explanationof how he had helped Bannon and Lila escape. The confession seemed cathartic forthe old man, and he slid off the table, dropping to his knees and begging beforeKing Grieve.Grieve’s mood hardened, and he summoned all the terrified slaves into the dininghall. “Our fleet is about to go to war! I command you to prepare an appropriatefeast to celebrate our impending victory.”The Norukai let out a deafening cheer. When Grieve bellowed his instructions,the slaves quailed, and Emmett broke down into another flood of wordless sobs.The king realized that at last he was hungry again.*Lars and five other prominent Norukai captains sat at the main table, while Attaremained at King Grieve’s side. She gave him a lascivious leer, blinking hercowlike eyes, but the king’s attention was focused on the slaves who ploddedinto the banquet hall. On their shoulders, as if they carried a stretcher with awounded warrior, they brought an enormous serving platter. The terrified slaveskept their gazes downcast as they placed the serving platter with its roastedmeat in front of Grieve.The shriveled blackened body of the old slave had curled up in a fetal positionin the fires of the ovens. Emmett had been roasted alive, because the Norukaiknew that terror and pain enhanced the flavor of the meat.“He was old and tough,” Grieve said. “I expect the meat will be stringy, barelyedible.”Atta used her dagger to poke through the crisp skin, splitting open the blackcrust to reveal juicy flesh underneath. “I’ll savor the feast just as I willsavor our victory, King Grieve.” She hacked a hunk of meat from Emmett’s thighand extended it to Grieve on the point of her knife.He took the offering and chewed it. “Yes, it’s good. This old man served theBastion for many years, and now we serve him.” He raised his armored fist.“Come, all of you—eat! This is our feast before war.”The Norukai rushed forward and tore into the roasted body of the old slave."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 61 [part0003.html#a7]The townspeople hurried to the docks to see the two castaways fished out of thesea, eager to hear their story. Nathan received the news with more joy than hehad experienced in a long time. Bannon was alive!The young man and Lila were sunburned and bedraggled from drifting alone fordays, but they were feeling stronger by the time a small fishing boat called theDaisy brought them to Renda Bay. Kenneth, the Daisy’s pilot, clanged his bell ashe arrived.As Bannon stepped off the boat, he looked tough and determined, much differentfrom the naive young man Nicci had rescued in a Tanimura alley long ago. Hishazel eyes shone as he hurried down the dock and embraced Nathan. The wizardpounded him on the back. “Dear spirits, I never expected to see you again, myboy!”Bannon stepped back, laughing. “Your wizard robes are gone! You look like anadventurer again.”“I never stopped being an adventurer, and now this war will require all of myskills, both with magic and with my sword.” He embraced Bannon for a longmoment, overjoyed. “You’re back with us. That’s the most important part for now!Dear spirits, it’s good to see you.”Thorn and Lyesse used sharp elbows to clear a path through the townspeoplecrowded at the docks, wanting to see Lila. “We heard that a morazeth had beenfound floating in the sea,” said Thorn. “It is good to have you here, Lila. Weneed more worthy fighters.”Lyesse said, “Thorn and I have been keeping score of our kills, but with thesize of the army about to hit Renda Bay, you will quickly catch up with us.”“I will make a good accounting of myself,” Lila said. Seagulls wheeled overhead,screaming like wounded victims on a battlefield.“What army?” Bannon sounded more alarmed. “We came to warn you about the Norukaifleet. King Grieve will attack soon with hundreds of ships. He’ll devastate thecoast. You need to prepare.”Nathan recoiled. “A Norukai fleet is on its way? But the army of General Utroswill be here in a day or two to ransack the town!”Bannon paled. “The Norukai and Utros formed an alliance, but I thought theancient army would take much longer to march across the land.”Lila cautioned, “We don’t even know how much time has passed, boy. I have notbeen counting the days since Ildakar vanished.”Thorn inspected the healing bruises on her morazeth sister’s face. “You aredamaged. Have you two been sparring?”“We damaged many Norukai as well,” Lila said.The people of Renda Bay crowded around, and General Zimmer strode up,accompanied by Norcross and Trevor. “I want a full debriefing of what you knowabout the Norukai and their plans. I didn’t expect to fight on two fronts sosoon.”Thaddeus raised his hands. “We will share stories in my office in the town hall.We’ll make our plans there.”Though Nathan could see how weary Bannon was, they couldn’t afford to grant himor Lila a well-earned rest. He stepped forward with a reassuring smile. “Thereis one thing I can do for you, though.” He touched the young man’s bruised face,his puffy lip. Bannon winced when Nathan released his healing gift to repair thedamage to the sunburned and freckled face, and within moments he stood wholeagain.When the wizard attempted to heal the similar bruises on Lila’s face, she shookher head. “The protective runes on my skin will block you. They guard me frommagic, but they also thwart any efforts to use a healing spell.” She drew abreath. “I will endure. It is nothing.”As they headed toward the town hall, the three morazeth walked together inperfect unison. Even after the healing spell, Bannon looked exhausted andbattered, but now he had a spring in his step, glad to be back among friends.In the town hall, Thaddeus dragged chairs around his sturdy wooden desk. Nathanshifted the ornate sword at his side and straightened his embroidered cape as hesat down. Zimmer did not sit, but paced near the wall.Thaddeus ran a callused finger along the spines of ledgers on the shelves.“These books contain the names of people lost in Norukai raids over the pasthundred years. We thought we had raised sufficient defenses, thanks to CaptainNorcross. We believed we could drive the enemy away and keep Renda Bay strong,but all our efforts were in vain.”Bannon and Lila took turns telling the story of their ordeals among the Norukai.Lila gave a crisp, bare-bones report, but the young man’s description of whathad happened was agitated and emotional. “I wish we’d killed all of them! I wishI hadn’t been captured by King Grieve. Then all of this would have beendifferent.”“Nevertheless, we are back together,” Nathan said with a wan smile. “Dearspirits, I am glad to have good news for a change. We have lost so much.”“And we’re about to lose more,” said Zimmer. “The army will be here withindays.”Norcross was flushed and restless. “All of the town’s defenses are in place,sir. The siege towers will guard the mouth of the harbor against the Norukai,and these people are determined to fight for their homes.” His eyes were largewith disbelief. “But if King Grieve has a navy of more than a hundred serpentships, we can’t possibly fight off that many. What are we going to do?”Lady Olgya pointed out, “And General Utros will soon arrive with many thousandsof soldiers. We’ll be caught between the two forces.”Thaddeus swallowed hard and said in a small voice, “Renda Bay is doomed, isn’tit?”General Zimmer said, “Under other circumstances, we might be in a position tostand against the Norukai with all our gifted fighters, the D’Haran soldiers,and the determined townspeople. The siege towers are strong, and the traps inthe harbor could sink several attacking ships. The catapults will do a greatdeal of damage.” He sounded more grim. “But it will not be enough if we arepressed by two devastating enemies at the same time.”“I’m far less concerned about the Norukai than I am about General Utros,” saidOron, sitting in his borrowed wooden chair as if it were a throne. “The Norukaiare unruly brutes, but Utros is the greater danger to our civilization.”“Both are threats,” Nathan said, “especially if they have the same goal. Wedon’t know when King Grieve’s fleet will set sail, but we know those thousandsof enemy soldiers are marching down the river road. They will be here soon. Howare we to stand against them all?”“If we had enough blood,” Olgya said, “we could raise another shroud and sealRenda Bay off from the rest of the world.”Bannon looked queasy, knowing exactly what Olgya was suggesting. Nathan said,“We can’t just hide like Ildakar. The rest of the world needs our help as well.”“My people are armed and ready to fight,” said Thaddeus. “They’ve been trainedever since Captain Norcross and his soldiers were placed here. We aren’thelpless, but we need to have some hope.”“And that is the catch,” Nathan said, and his voice cracked. “We no longer havePrelate Verna. We have been whittling away at General Utros’s forces, but notenough.” When he looked up at Zimmer, he realized how haggard the commanderlooked. “General, is there a chance we can protect Renda Bay when the armyarrives? Any chance at all?”Zimmer pondered for a long moment before answering. “I’ve tried to imagine anyrealistic scenario that might lead to victory. Even though we inflicted terriblelosses at Cliffwall, and Prelate Verna created great devastation, we still hadto fall back. Renda Bay is smaller and far more vulnerable, so I’m afraid theanswer is no. We must be realistic for our own survival.” His expression sagged.“This town has to be evacuated. Everyone must pack up their belongings andleave.”Thaddeus groaned. “But we’ve been through so much! We fought off attacks andrebuilt our homes again and again. Now, to just abandon it all . . .”“You have never faced anything like General Utros,” Oron said.“Alas, I have to agree,” Nathan said. “Many villagers have already disappearedinto the foothills because they’ve come to the same conclusion. You know ityourself, Thaddeus.”The town leader nodded somberly. “Hundreds of houses now stand empty after youbrought your news. The people know what is coming.”“We must get the rest of the population to safety,” said the sorceress Perri,“and we have to depart too. We can’t just wait here and be overwhelmed.”Nathan stroked his chin. “We need to send word north as fast as we can and soundthe alarm. The major cities have to be alerted. Nicci used the sliph to travelto Serrimundi and Tanimura, and I hope the Old World is already building upgreat defenses.” His lips quirked in a smile. “She can be very persuasive.”“But that doesn’t help Renda Bay,” Thaddeus said.Captain Norcross said, “We still have those three large sailing ships in theharbor and dozens of fishing boats. If we do abandon the town before Utrosarrives, they could carry refugees to safety, save many lives.”Thaddeus rested his elbows on his scarred wooden desktop. “How am I going totell my people? Some of them will insist on staying.”“Then they will die,” Lila said.Zimmer continued pacing with his hands locked behind his back. “There is simplyno alternative.”Nathan remembered the gaunt and pale enemy soldiers that had attacked Cliffwall.“We have to do more than just empty Renda Bay. We cannot give aid and comfort tothe enemy. They’ve been marching across the mountains and over the valleys,stripping the landscape clean in their wake, but they can’t possibly have enoughsupplies to sustain them. They are starving. We dare not leave a bushel of corn,a chicken, a dried apple, or a grain of rice. We must deny that army anyresources, any shelter.” He stroked his long white hair and adjusted his cape.“You know what we have to do. We must destroy the town of Renda Bay—burn itdown, leave nothing but scorched earth by the time General Utros arrives.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 62 [part0003.html#a7]After she inspected the Tanimura garrison, Nicci and General Linden worked fordays strengthening the city guard and pressing countless new recruits intoservice, many of them drawn from the refugees that had flooded the city afterthe Norukai attacks.Hundreds of battered survivors came up the coast road from the south, peopledisplaced from Effren and Larrikan Shores. Many were weak and saddened, seekingonly stability in their lives. Others could not forget the blood and fire, thenightmare of the ruthless raiders, and they wanted to fight back. With nothingbut threadbare clothes on their backs and the scabs of healing wounds, theydesperately needed aid, but Serrimundi could absorb only so many refugees, sincethat city had itself suffered significant damage in Kor’s raid.Up in Tanimura, Nicci listened to their stories, one after another. When shelooked at the outraged survivors, she knew they could be forged into an army,which was exactly what the Old World needed. Calling upon her own determination,she rallied them in the Tanimura square. “Soon a full-fledged war will be uponus. Will you let the Norukai hunt you down and kill your families, or will youtake up weapons and learn how to fight back?”The resounding shouts nearly deafened her. She could see Linden’s surprise as helooked at the unexpected and earnest recruits for the army. Nicci gestured tothe refugees. “The D’Haran garrison here will give you what you need, and Iintend to set up training bases in Serrimundi as well, rally the blacksmiths andarmorers in every city. We don’t have much time. Everyone needs to pulltogether. What happened in Effren must not happen again!”*She wanted to see the devastation for herself. With Linden’s permission, Niccigathered fifty soldiers and a dozen angry refugees, then set off on a swiftmilitary ship, sailing south to Effren.Two days later, reaching the black scar of the town, they anchored the swiftship offshore because all of the docks had been burned to the waterline. Nicciaccompanied her group of soldiers and pale survivors, who clung tospiderweb-thin threads of hope that they might recover something from the ruins.Others simply wanted to bury their dead or at least lay markers for fallenfriends and family members.As Nicci walked through the ruins, her boots crunched on charred wood and thecracked bones of victims. Though the fires had burned out weeks before, thesmell of soot and ash hung in the seaside air. Nicci imagined she could hear thelingering echoes of screams. The imprint of pain, violence, and suffering wouldremain here for years to come.“Sweet Sea Mother,” muttered one of the guard recruits who had come fromSerrimundi. “Those animals left nothing standing! Why would an army do this?”Soot smeared the side of his face where he had wiped away a tear. “If they meantto conquer Effren, why destroy it all? Why kill everyone? That is not how youwin a war.”“The Norukai come to pillage, not to rule,” she said. “You watched them attackSerrimundi Harbor. You know what they are.”The recruit looked around the dead, silent ruins, appalled. “If we hadn’tstopped them, would they have done this to Serrimundi, too? To my city?”“Without question. That is why we had to obliterate them. Captain Kor is dead,and not a single Norukai got away.” Warm pride filled her chest. “But Lars isstill out there. We will have to crush them again, and again, until they learntheir lesson.”Nicci walked among the haunted forest of timbers, collapsed walls, charredrooftops of what had been a thriving town. She knew what Effren must have beenlike, a community of several thousand fishermen, boatbuilders, farmers,woodcutters, smiths, shopkeepers, traders. The town would have had taverns,inns, shops, stables, a marketplace. Now only ashes remained. The site was adark stain, as if a bolt of lightning had erased the town from existence.She and the soldiers walked slowly through the streets. Warm sun beat downthrough a hazy sky. The smoke was gone, but some of the recruits and refugeeskept coughing, perhaps to hide their nausea and grief. She herself had helpeddefend the town of Renda Bay from another Norukai raid. In that instance,though, they had won.Nicci remembered the Renda Bay cemetery, with many stone markers to indicate thedead who were buried there, as well as countless wooden posts bearing the namesof those who had been taken by the Norukai. Nicci had learned to hate thescarred raiders then, and her opinion of them had not improved after sheactually met Lars, Kor, and other Norukai traders who came to Ildakar to selltheir pitiful slaves.She entered the burned-out skeleton of what had been a tavern. One wall hadcollapsed, while two stone half walls remained intact. Nicci stepped gingerlythrough the rubble, absorbing the sense of the place and filling in details withher imagination. Blackened lumps had been tables and stools, a splinteredcounter. A sealed cask of ale had exploded when its contents boiled in the fire.Six skulls were readily visible, and she didn’t doubt they could find others ifthey sifted through the ashes.“What are we going to do here, Sorceress?” asked the anxious recruit, who hadfollowed her.“I wanted to see with my own eyes.” She moved slowly, her black dress blendingin with the burned ruins. Charcoal-encrusted beams had bent under the heat,looking like the bones of long-dead dragons. “And I wanted you all to rememberthat this is what the Norukai will do if we let them win.” She inhaled deeply,smelling the death and agony around her.The recruit nodded. Now he had a smear of soot on his opposite cheek from asecond tear.“Do we rebuild?” a long-faced refugee asked. “Once we are strong again, shouldwe try? Should we start now?” He turned around in the destroyed tavern, and itwas obvious he remembered the place. “Will we have the heart to make Effren ourhome again?”“Not until after the war,” Nicci said. “You would only be giving the Norukaisomething new to burn. For now, your best chance is to become fighters.” IfUtros and his army were on the way, and if the ancient general had indeed joinedforces with the Norukai, then the Old World would be awash in blood. And soon.In burned-out homes they discovered several ghostlike squatters, villagers whohad fled into the hills and now came back to the remains of their town, shockedand numb. Two battlefield surgeons tended to their injuries. Nicci hoped totoughen and recruit them for the new military force she was building.She would have preferred that Richard lead the D’Haran army to fight at her sideand crush both Utros and King Grieve. But Richard was counting on her, and Nicciwould not let him down. He had sent her down to the Old World to pave the wayfor a new golden age of peace and prosperity, relying on Nicci to crush anyupstart dictator or ill-advised tyrant.She had never dreamed of the threat she faced now, a gigantic army fromcenturies past, and a raiding fleet of countless attack ships.How could Richard’s small bone box be everything she needed? With a soot-stainedhand, she slipped the little cube out of her pocket and looked at the etchedletters in the language of Creation, felt the tingle in her fingers. Richard wasa master of constructed spells and this one was tighter, more intricate than anyshe had seen. Through her gift, she could sense its potential, but not how itworked or what its purpose was. Nicci feared that its use was beyond herabilities, but Richard believed in her, so how could she do any less?Who else could she ask? None of the other gifted in Tanimura had her breadth ofknowledge, except perhaps some of the Sisters of the Light who remained in thecity. The Sisters had eagerly scrutinized the artifact when Nicci asked theiropinion, but despite their strong desire to help, none of the Sisters hadoffered any insight.So it would have to be her. Opening the delicate lid, she studied the shimmeringwhite sphere, the pulsing nugget of a constructed spell. “I can handle this,”she said as an affirmation to herself. She would figure it out, when the propertime came.Still, she had a hard time maintaining her confidence as she gazed across thewasteland that had been a thriving town.Before the war was over, there would be many more devastated towns. The peoplewere fighting for their lives, their homes, their families. This Norukai raidhad killed hundreds, maybe thousands, but the Effren tragedy would be like asharp stick poking a coiled rattlesnake. Nicci intended to inspire all thesurvivors to strike back with sharp fangs.Effren, Serrimundi, Larrikan Shores, and all the coastal cities would recoverand thrive again. Nicci just had to save the world first."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 63 [part0003.html#a7]With a sinking heart, Norcross followed his orders and worked to evacuate RendaBay. The need to abandon the town had struck the people like a thunderclap, buttheir angry resolve to fight for their homes had crumbled in the face ofreality. Even all of them together could never stand against nearly a hundredthousand armed warriors.“This doesn’t mean we are giving up,” the wizard Nathan had insisted, “but evenif every single person in Renda Bay killed a hundred enemies, General Utros andKing Grieve would still have enough fighters to grind your town into dust. We’llstill find a way to hurt them.”“I need to keep our people safe,” Thaddeus agreed. “We will load the threesailing ships and every fishing boat we have, and others will flee into thehills and hide. We have to get our people out of here. We have to!”Accompanied by squads of D’Haran soldiers, Norcross marched up and down thestreets, pounding on doors. Criers shouted for all citizens to pack up theirfood and run for their lives. By the time General Utros arrived, Renda Bay wouldbe a ghost town, stripped of any resources he could use.Down by the docks, lines of men and women carried satchels of their mostprecious belongings as they boarded boats to get away. Wailing children clutchedtheir mothers’ hands or tugged on their skirts; one pigtailed girl grinned as ifthis were a great adventure.In order to make more room on the Daisy, Kenneth had tossed any crates, barrels,and tools overboard. Now loaded with people, the fishing boat rode so low in thewater that Kenneth looked concerned. He pulled up the boarding plank. “Can’ttake any more people. There are other boats.”Even though the relentless army was less than a day away, according to scoutreports, the villagers remained mostly calm. They waited for more vessels toreach the docks as the Daisy set sail and moved off past the stone defensivetowers. Once the heavily laden craft reached open water, Kenneth turned north,followed by ten other equally full vessels in a civilian flotilla. They sailedaway, hoping to be far out of sight before the armies closed in.As more boats took on passengers, one old woman wrestled with two goats. Shestamped her foot on the dock boards, but the fisherman captain waved her away.“You can’t come aboard with the animals. There’s no room! We have to save thepeople.”“But Choo and Loo are like people. They’re my children.” She wrapped her bonyarms around the goats. “I won’t leave them behind.”The passengers already aboard called out from the deck, frightened andimpatient, “Leave them, Maggs! That army’s coming.”“I know! And those soldiers will eat Choo and Loo.”Sensing the tension, Norcross hurried among the people. “Take your animals deepinto the hills and hide, ma’am. Turn the goats loose, and they’ll be fine, butbe sure to go far enough away from the army. You can stay out there with them,or come back here to board a boat if you make it in time. We just don’t haveenough vessels to carry livestock!” The goats bleated pitifully, and Norcrossfrowned. “No matter how cute they are.”Old Maggs left in a huff, yanking the ropes and leading her goats through thecrowds and out of town.In small dinghies, sailors rowed load after load of people out to the threelarge cargo ships anchored outside the bay. After overseeing the evacuation,Norcross would join General Zimmer and Thaddeus, who were already aboard CaptainMills’s ship, directing the movement and retreat.Amber accompanied him, along with Sisters Rhoda and Eldine, while the otherSisters of the Light worked their way through the town with Nathan, Oron, andthe remaining gifted defenders. They were preparing a surprise for the ancientarmy.“We’ve been separate for so long,” Amber said to him with a smile. “I want tostay with you.”“I missed you, too,” he said. “When we’re aboard our ship, we’ll have plenty oftime to catch up, but for now, all these people . . .” He sighed. “There must bea thousand left to evacuate!”“I’ll help however I can,” she said, lifting her chin. “Prelate Verna was verypatient in teaching me how to use my gift. She taught me amazing things.” Shelooked away to hide her sad expression. “I really miss the prelate. She was sokind to me and so wise.”“She did meet a brave end.”Amber nodded. “Yes, but it was still an end. I’d rather she were still here.”Lila and Bannon came down to the docks, flushed from running. The young manlooked upset. “That’s a stubborn family! What do they expect to do? Throw claypots at thousands of soldiers?”Lila seemed equally annoyed. “It is a potter’s shop, not a gold mine. We couldnot convince them.” She glared at Bannon. “And you refused to let me knock themsenseless and drag them here.”Norcross let out a heavy sigh, knowing that there were many families who simplyrefused to leave. “It might not be a gold mine, but it is their home. I onlyhope they’re sensible enough to flee as soon as they see the army approaching.”Over the next hour, the last fishing vessels sailed away. The three cargo shipswere nearly full after a constant succession of rowboats carried groups out towhere the ships were anchored and came back to pick up more evacuees. When itwas time, with the town mostly empty behind them, Bannon and Lila climbed aboarda dinghy so they, too, could take a place aboard Captain Mills’s ship.“This is a great improvement over our last boat,” she remarked, and Bannonagreed.Norcross and Amber remained behind to round up the last few boatloads. Thorn andLyesse jogged down the streets, making a beeline toward the harbor as theysounded the alarm. “The first enemy soldiers are no more than an hour away!”“We killed only four before we had to retreat,” Lyesse added. “I don’t think weslowed them much. They are more wary now.”Thorn frowned. “Nathan commanded us not to fight any more of the army for now,because it puts us at unnecessary risk.” She sounded disappointed. “It seemswrong.”“Oron, Olgya, and Perri concurred.” Lyesse sounded equally downcast. “But sincethey are all that remains of the wizards’ duma from Ildakar, we must obey them.They told us to go.” The two morazeth watched the next dinghy come in, rowed bytwo muscular sailors.“We all have to obey orders,” Norcross said. Behind him, the town was empty. Hecould see the deserted wooden houses, shops, inns, town hall, and the opensquare. “There aren’t many boats left for Nathan and the others. Are they almostfinished?”“Who can know about the work of wizards?” Lyesse asked with a snort. She sprangfrom the dock into the dinghy even before the sailors had tied it up. Hermorazeth sister joined her.Amber smiled at her brother. “Let’s get out to the ships. It’s our turn.”Norcross and Amber rode with the two morazeth and several other stragglers asmore empty rowboats came to the docks for the last evacuees, which would includeNathan and his companions.The burly sailors were weary at the oars, having gone back and forth severaltimes already. Seeing this, Thorn and Lyesse moved them from their bench. “Yourequire rest. Let us row.”Surprised, the muscular men relinquished the oars. The morazeth rowed with greatvigor, pulling them toward the nearest three-masted sailing ship. As they passedbeneath the tall siege towers at the mouth of the bay, Norcross looked up with apang. He saw the catapults lined up, ready to hurl boulders at oncoming serpentships. He had worked so hard on the town’s defenses. “We were prepared to hurtthe Norukai, but we won’t get the chance.”“We’ll get a chance.” Amber clutched her brother’s arm. “This is our chance tosurvive.”When the dinghy reached the sailing ship, Norcross and the passengers climbed upa slat ladder to the deck, which was already crowded with Renda Bay evacuees.Captain Mills stood at the stern shading his eyes, deeply worried. In the smallboat below, the sailors prepared to set off again, glad for their brief restwhile the morazeth rowed.Norcross stared back at the deserted town. A gigantic army would swarm throughthose streets before long, ransacking empty buildings. He hoped Nathan and theothers would make it back soon.A lookout high on the mainmast used a spyglass peering southwest. “Confirmed,Captain! Sighting confirmed!”Mills began clanging a brass bell mounted next to the wheel. He hammered theclapper back and forth for all he was worth. “Prepare yourselves! They’recoming.”Norcross turned to look out at the open sea and saw a line of ominous ships justcoming into view, all of them with midnight-blue sails.*Nathan went from building to building in Renda Bay, scribing spell-forms on barewalls, laying down protective webs, and adding anchor points. He ferventlywished he had Prelate Verna there to help him, or Elsa with her transferencemagic. “Dear spirits, I don’t normally use my gift for so much destruction,unless I absolutely have to.”“This time you absolutely have to,” said Perri. The woman’s gift was weaker thanLeo’s had been, but as a shaper Perri could use magic to shift wood and stone.She used her finger to embed gouges and spell-forms in the walls of townbuildings, inscribing them swiftly and perfectly, whereas Nathan would have hadto carve the designs more crudely with the point of his knife.With great relish, Oron and Olgya went about setting booby traps. Lord Oron usedpaint to draw looping connective runes from one street to another, laying downwhat looked like an odd design but was actually a convoluted trap. This wouldbecome readily apparent as soon as the enemy soldiers triggered the smallconstructed spells in the doorways of major buildings and collapsed theinterconnected webs. Olgya laid down magical trip wires across the main streetsand inside the primary storehouses that were sure to attract the starving army.Though he felt a chill about preparing such a cascade of powerful magic, Nathanknew this set of spells was not the same as Verna’s Weeping Stone spell, whichhad slipped out of her control. This was far simpler, cleaner magic, and theyall knew how to use it and master it.Nathan had mapped the streets of Renda Bay and picked their targets. His giftedcomrades listened intently as he described his strategy. “We have to lure thefront ranks into the destructive zone. Only then can we let the magic betriggered, otherwise it’ll be too soon.”Oron gritted his teeth, “So long as they are dead, I don’t care where the magicstrikes.”“We’ll kill more of them if we let them reach the center of town before the trapis sprung,” Sister Sharon pointed out. “The prelate killed thousands when shebrought down the canyon wall. Let us do the same in Renda Bay.”“General Utros may be more cautious now,” Nathan said. “The important part isthat we deny them any supplies. His soldiers are already starving, marchingalong and half dead. They will drop from hunger and weariness soon.”“I’d rather they burn,” Oron said.Nathan and Perri worked together in the town hall for the last stage of theirplan. Standing inside Thaddeus’s office looking at the historic ledgers andbooks on the shelves, he felt sadness again. “More knowledge being wiped out.Again! I wonder how we will ever forgive ourselves.”Perri asked, “Would you rather keep your musty old tomes and let the world beconquered? Sacrificing a few books does not seem like such a great cost todefeat the army.”“I would rather survive and write new books.”Perri finished marking spell-forms on the walls of the town leader’s office.“There, now the lines are connected from the tower down to the foundations.Renda Bay is evacuated, and everything is set. We should get to the ships.”“Yes, the army is close.” Wearing his fine embroidered cape and vest, Nathanfelt satisfied as he emerged from the town hall to meet his gifted companions.“Time to go. Everyone down to the harbor.”They hurried toward the docks, where the calm, blue waters of Renda Bay awaitedthem. The fishing boats had loaded up and already sailed away to the north. Thethree large cargo ships remained anchored, filled with passengers and ready todepart, with just a few rowboats ready to carry Nathan and his gifted saboteurs.He glanced one last time at the vacant town. Everyone seemed to be gone. Thehomes were empty, except for the booby traps of magic they had placed instrategic places.He heard a sudden loud clamor from the sailing ships out on the water, a bellringing and ringing to sound the alarm.Perri looked up. “What is that?”“Nothing good.” Oron hurried down the street to the waiting rowboats at thedock, where anxious sailors urged them to hurry. Nathan and the others ranfaster.From the dock he could see at least a hundred serpent ships on the horizon,sailing directly toward Renda Bay."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 64 [part0003.html#a7]General Utros had not smelled the sea in fifteen centuries. Long ago, one of hismilitary marches had taken him to the coast, and he remembered how he had staredout at the sun on the open waves, observed the sailing ships and fishingsettlements, and known he wanted to conquer them.Now, the relentless march took his army along a river that flowed to the ocean.Approaching Renda Bay, he smelled the salt air again, which brought with it atang of freedom. The soldiers marched nonstop, hour after hour, though they weregaunt and starving despite the spell that numbed the gnawing hunger in theirbellies. Along the river, they grabbed fish, waterfowl, even weeds from thecurrent, devouring whatever they could find. And they kept moving.Utros, Enoch, and Ruva rode in the lead as they approached a significant town atthe mouth of the river, the largest settlement they had encountered sincecrossing the mountains. Along the way, his army had overwhelmed smallervillages, mining towns, and crossroads settlements, which had offered only leanpickings. Renda Bay at last would offer supplies and materials.“Tonight we will eat well,” said First Commander Enoch, sitting high on his darkhorse.Utros considered making this fishing port his new base, where he could meet upwith the Norukai fleet. After King Grieve and his serpent ships departed fromIldakar, the two great military forces had had no communication with each other,and their overall war plan was based on nothing more than crude maps and vaguememories. During the long days of marching, Utros had pondered strategicpossibilities about conquering the land, whether to use his army as a singlebattering ram to crush anything in the way, or to split the force into dozens ofsub-armies dispatched in all directions. He would make his final decision oncehe conquered Renda Bay.When the Norukai eventually joined with his army, the scarred raiders wouldinspire fear among their victims. Utros would let the reckless warriors bear thebrunt of any resistance, suffering casualties so that his own men remaineduninjured. That was his entire purpose for the alliance with them.“Will King Grieve be here in Renda Bay? And his vile shaman?” Ruva’s voiceturned sour.“We shall see. We don’t need the Norukai, but we can use them.” He urged hisblack stallion toward the town’s outskirts. A ripple of excitement rolledthrough the ranks, an awareness that their destination was ahead at last, andthe town would no doubt be filled with supplies and plunder.They passed empty meadows, stripped orchards, abandoned farmhouses, vacantpaddocks for goats, sheep, or cattle, but no livestock. Utros frowned. “Thepeople have fled. Where are the animals?”“That’s no surprise, sir,” Enoch said. “They must have seen our army coming fordays. Who would dare to stand against us?”Outriders broke into farmhouses and came out with blankets, some cook pots, andscraps of clothes, but they reported that the pantries were empty, every one ofthem. Even barrels in the root cellars were gone. More scouts ransacked theoutlying buildings and issued similar reports. Seeing no food at hand, anywhere,the troops began to grow anxious.Enoch’s expression hardened. “Should I make a sortie into town, General? Seewhat we can find?”Annoyed, Utros urged his mount to a faster pace. “We will all go.”With a flicker in the air, Ava’s shimmering spirit appeared. “I went ahead,beloved Utros. Renda Bay has been abandoned. The people fled.” She driftedagainst her twin sister, and the green aura brightened, as if the two drewenergy from each other. “The whole town is empty.”Ruva’s voice echoed along with her twin’s. “The wizard Nathan and his gadfliesmust have arrived first and warned them.”Ava separated. “We should have killed him and all those others at Cliffwall!That might have appeased the Keeper while we continue our war.”“Killing those people is of secondary importance,” Utros said. “Even if the townis empty, we will occupy it as our base of operations. I need to plan our nextmove, with or without the Norukai.”He pressed his stallion into a gallop, and Enoch and Ruva rode beside him as ifmaking a military charge. The soldiers in the vanguard let out a heroes’ cry andcharged ahead to attack a silent city.At the edge of town, Utros noted stables, farmhouses, a smithy, a sawmill, abrickyard, a cooper’s shop with half-finished barrels lying among piles ofstaves and iron hoops. At the center of Renda Bay they saw the main square, thelarge town hall. Everything was empty.“Find them!” Utros pointed to the left and right. “Those are warehouses, grainsilos. There must be some animals in the pens and stockyards. Report all foodstockpiles you find. Our supply sergeants will divide up the spoils to best feedour men.”The encroaching army roared with excitement. Soldiers broke ranks and rushedinto the streets, ransacking the buildings. They smashed doors and charged intowarehouses, but they came back out perplexed, angry, and empty-handed.“There’s nothing, General,” reported one of the first scout captains. “The barnsand warehouses are vacant. We didn’t find even a bale of hay for our horses.”Utros adjusted the horned helmet and stared ahead. “I have conquered anabandoned town.” He pushed his stallion toward the central square. “There mustbe more here!”Enoch gestured beyond the descending streets that led to the water and the openbay. “Down there, sir. Look at the docks—all the boats are gone.”Utros’s leather gauntlet creaked as he clenched a fist. Beyond the mouth of thebay he spotted three large ships departing under full sail. Then he caught hisbreath as he saw more than a hundred serpent ships pursuing them like a pack ofwolves. “The Norukai are coming. King Grieve hunts them down as they try toflee.”Ruva raised her fingers and traced invisible lines of magic in the air. “I wouldbe happier to kill those vermin ourselves, but I will rest easily just knowingthey are dead.”“The fleeing people aren’t our concern. They are already gone.” Utros ran afinger over the smooth surface of his half mask. “We need to find what’s left ofthis town. We need to feed our troops.”The streets were paved with cobblestones, and the horses’ hoofbeats echoedloudly as they clattered forward. On the way to the central square, hungryvanguard soldiers rushed past the general and spread out to break into shops andhomes. They smashed windows, battered down doors, and caused even more damage intheir frustration. Utros expected they would find some stragglers barricadedbehind doors, but Renda Bay was eerily silent.Ava’s spirit drifted about. “There’s nothing . . . but also something. I sensedanger here. Beware, General.”Ruva sat on her bay mare, shuddering. Gooseflesh covered her pale skin. “I canfeel deadly lines of force. This isn’t simply an empty town. Nathan and theothers left something for us here.” She sketched in the air with an extendedfingertip. Ava faced her sister, touching her spectral fingertip against Ruva’s,and together they opened a spiderweb of bright lines, identifying a pattern.“It is a trap. These buildings are more than empty. They’re waiting to be—”As the scouts broke into prominent storehouses near the town hall, theytriggered an activation web. Bright lights sizzled through the walls of thestorehouse, and the shuttered windows overhead burst open with a flood of brightlight, a flare of heat. Gouts of flame erupted through the roof. Covered withfire, soldiers staggered back out, trying to smother the flames on theirsmoldering leather armor. In seconds, the entire storehouse became an inferno,as if it had been built of straw and kindling.On the opposite side of the square, another building ignited, then a third onewith such a vigorous explosion that the wallboards shot deadly splinters in alldirections.Ruva raised both hands. “I feel the tingling everywhere, down that street, downthis street, along that alley!” She looked in horror at the cobblestones, whereshe saw painted lines that some wizard had left behind. “We are caught in themiddle of the web.”The town hall suddenly glowed with jagged cracks of orange heat, like lightningbolts within the stone blocks. A blast broke down the façade, and the debriscrumbled toward them. The general’s black stallion screamed, and he hunched overthe saddle, holding on as he galloped away. Flames raged down the street as onespell triggered another.Ava’s spirit swooped along, leading him to safety. Other horses raced for theharbor and the open water. His soldiers scattered, charging at a full run downside streets, trying to stay ahead of the flame front. In doing so, they ignitedone booby trap after another, setting off a cascade of magic.The cobblestones cracked and shuddered. Lines of magic drew down into swirlingpatterns that connected building to building and square to square. The Renda Baystreets became molten, and all the adjacent buildings ignited from the connectedtapestry of magic.“Ride!” Utros roared.The entire town became an inferno, incinerating countless soldiers. Summoningher gift, Ruva called a downpour to drench some of the fire and douse the lowerstreets. It was enough to keep Utros and the front ranks safe, but behind themthe burning town cut off the rest of his army, engulfing many of the soldiers inflames.Once he was safe by the waterfront, Utros turned away from the smoke and fireand looked angrily out to sea, where Norukai ships were approaching the fleeingcargo ships that carried the survivors of Renda Bay.*Out beyond the harbor, the two big sailing ships commanded by Captains Strakerand Donell sailed away from Renda Bay full of evacuees. As the last of thegifted defenders came aboard the third ship, Captain Mills rang the alarm bellagain and again. The serpent ships closed in on Renda Bay.Nathan took a position near the bow as they got underway, following the othertwo large vessels. A sudden ripple of dismay crossed the deck as the passengerswatched orange flames blossom in the center of town. Smoke erupted in pillars.He smiled. “Looks like General Utros found our surprise.”Oron wore a grim expression as he stroked his thick, pale braid. “There is moreto come.”Moments later, additional blazes surged, like storms of fire triggered by theunsuspecting invaders. The sky blackened as more smoke rose, and the infernobuilt upon itself. Before long, the entire town was engulfed in fire. The blazesleaped from building to building, raced down street after street.Thaddeus and other evacuees from Renda Bay stared back at their receding homes,weeping. The freed slave Rendell placed a comforting hand on the town leader’sshoulder.Olgya was more intent on the countless serpent ships racing toward them acrossthe sea. “How do we fight against the Norukai? They are closing in fast.”Captain Mills paced the deck, shouting orders to his sailors. Familiar withtheir ship, they used the complex interaction of rigging, rudder, and sails tocatch breezes and steer the ship at the greatest possible speed. Some of thegifted passengers assisted by increasing the wind in the proper direction.Norcross stood next to General Zimmer, who alternated his glare between theburning town and the fleet of pursuing serpent ships. “After attacking Utros sooften, it should be a nice change of pace to fight the Norukai.”Nathan watched the receding siege towers at the mouth of the bay and felt a pangin his heart, which twisted as Ivan’s presence plagued him, but he pushed backthe darkness. He turned his attention to the oncoming Norukai fleet.The serpent ships had the breezes at their backs, and they put on an additionalburst of speed using oars manned by strong warriors. Ten Norukai vesselscontinued after the evacuating ships, while the rest of the enemy fleet slowedand diverted toward the burning town of Renda Bay. Increasing smoke rose intothe sky.Next to Nathan, Bannon watched the inevitable approach of the dark blue sails ofthe pursuing ships, his face flushed with anger. “Looks like I’ll have anotherchance to kill some Norukai.” He touched the sword at his hip, a standard bladethat General Zimmer had provided from the D’Haran spares. “Any sword is goodenough, but I miss Sturdy.” He looked down at his unfamiliar weapon.“You’ll get practice soon enough, boy,” Lila said. She was armed with a daggerand a sword she had retrieved in Renda Bay, and she looked fierce. “Stay by me,and we will make a good accounting of ourselves.”Nathan knew how much the ungainly sword had meant to Bannon. Sturdy was a lotlike the red-haired swordsman himself, unimposing and plain, but deceptivelydeadly. Nathan pondered the more ornate sword he had carried since leavingD’Hara. He had chosen it along with fine travel clothes to be part of hisswashbuckling image. Nathan had considered the showy blade to be an importantaccessory for an adventurer, but now that he had his gift back, his realidentity was that of a wizard. He could still fight with a sword whenevernecessary, but the fancy, expensive weapon was not nearly as important tohim—not as important as it would be to Bannon.He undid the buckle and removed the scabbard. “My boy, you deserve this.”Bannon looked at him in surprise. “What do you mean?”“Take my sword. It should be the best ever forged, considering how much I paidfor it. The blade has served me well in many adventures, as you certainly know,but you would value it more than I.” He extended the sword. “It is my gift toyou.”Bannon was hesitant to accept it. “I’ve never used such a fancy blade.”“You stab with the point and cut with the edge,” Lila said. “Nothing unusualabout it.”Nathan pushed the pommel toward him. “You’d best take this before I change mymind.”Bannon accepted the sword from him. “Thank you, Nathan!” In wonder, he drew theblade out of its scabbard. Tears shone in his hazel eyes as he held the gleamingsteel up to the sunlight. “Maybe King Grieve will see it and run away.”“I would prefer that he come closer, so you can stick it in his heart,” Lilasaid.Nathan felt warm satisfaction. “Give me your borrowed blade in exchange, so I’mnot entirely unarmed.”Bannon handed over his sword, then proudly strapped on Nathan’s belt andscabbard. “It is a sword more worthy of your skills,” Lila said.“I still miss Sturdy,” he replied.“You are the weapon, Bannon Farmer. A blade is just a blade.”The hounding Norukai kept closing the distance, and it was clear they wouldconverge soon with their furious rowing. From the deck, Nathan could hear theshouts of angry warriors and the pounding beat of the oar master. “They arerelentless. And a bit foolish.”One serpent ship pulled ahead of the other four, its oars moving like theblurred legs of a centipede. Standing behind the carved serpent figurehead, oneNorukai roared out a challenge. He swung a spiked iron sphere on a chain.Bannon recognized him. “That one is named Bosko. He forced Lila and me to rowuntil we were ready to die.”“He thinks highly of himself,” Lila said with a snort. “I can smell him fromhere.”Bannon looked at her with a hard grin. “His stench could be fierce enough tokill an enemy.”The foremost serpent ship raced ahead of the others as if Bosko wanted tocapture them by himself.Amber, Oliver, and Peretta huddled together in a quick conversation. “We canhelp,” Amber said. “Watch this.”Oliver and Peretta stood beside her at the rail, shoulder-to-shoulder. Theyunleashed their gift and sent a joint wave of water and air that pushed acrossthe sea and slammed the side of Bosko’s ship. Aboard the vessel, the Norukaiscrambled to hold themselves in place as the force shoved them sideways andsnapped several oars. Some Norukai ran to the rigging, while others crowded theopposite side of the tilted ship, adding weight to bring it back level. The oarsbegan moving again, but the wounded ship cruised erratically.The three young friends cheered. “We did it. We stopped them!”Captain Mills shouted, “Steady ahead! We can gain more distance.”Scrambling to gain purchase on his buffeted ship, Bosko held the carvedfigurehead as he swirled his spiked mace. He roared a challenge, calling themcowards.Oron waited next to Nathan, his lips twisted in a frown. “It will not come tohand-to-hand fighting, not yet.” Impatient, he lifted a hand, palm outward. “Wecan strike them from here.”Nathan smiled. “Those trainees did a good job, but we can put an end to thisright now.” Together, the two wizards summoned twin lightning bolts. Both jaggedspears of energy struck at the same time, blasting the prow of the serpent shipand vaporizing Bosko in the blast of magic.“Must be all the gas pent up inside him,” Bannon said. Lila snickered.The rest of the Norukai ships pressed closer, and Captain Mills looked grave.“Good thing those other fishing boats got enough of a head start. I hope theyfound coves and other places to hide, but those Norukai will keep after us forday after day.”Behind them the smoke of Renda Bay towered like an anvil in the sky. Thepassengers stared at it, knowing their homes were now obliterated. The rest ofKing Grieve’s fleet clustered around the harbor town.“We have to get ahead of them and sound the alarm to the other cities on thecoast,” Nathan said. “They will turn around soon enough once they know theycan’t catch us.”“There’s another way I can help,” Olgya said. “A trick I learned back inIldakar, and I used it to some effect back at Cliffwall.” Using her gift, shereached out to the water all around them and manipulated the weather to raisedroplets. She summoned a fog bank as large as an island that spread out in asmoke screen behind them. White curls of vapor filled the air, hiding them fromthe Norukai captains. Soon, the evacuating ships disappeared entirely.Nathan smiled as he saw the swirling fog. Olgya seemed in a trance as shethickened the wisps, weaving it like a great silken cloth of vapor. The serpentships were quickly lost inside the smoke screen. “Most excellent. Now we can beon our way unimpeded.”Racing ahead of the wall of mist, the ships sailed under sunny skies, headingtoward the large cities in the Old World."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 65 [part0003.html#a7]Renda Bay burned uncontrolled for two days before all the fires died out,leaving nothing more than ashes and foundation stones. The main Norukai fleethad closed in outside the harbor, while several of the vessels pursued the threesailing ships that had fled the destruction. Eventually, they returned.Meanwhile, Utros ruled only ruins.During the worst of the blaze, First Commander Enoch sent scouts back up theriver, keeping to the water to make it through the fires to reconnect with themain body of the army, which was trapped on the other side of the conflagration.Thousands of troops rushed to cut firebreaks with axes and swords and formedlengthy bucket brigades from the river, but still the town burned.Despite their best efforts and inexhaustible manpower, the army saved only a fewdozen homes and shops, a pale victory since the buildings were empty anyway.Afterward, while ransacking the ruins in search of any scrap of food, theydiscovered more than two hundred charred bodies caught in the backwash of thefire, their bones mingled with ashes. More losses. . . .Ruva combined her gift with Ava’s spirit to clear some of the burned buildingsin order to fashion a command camp, and General Utros used one of the intacthouses as his base. He looked at the devastation and said in a low voice thatonly First Commander Enoch and the sorceresses could hear, “I had hoped to feedmy soldiers here. Are they supposed to eat ashes?”Ruva glided up against him. “My preservation spell will last. The soldiers cankeep marching all the way to Tanimura.”Utros rounded on her, glaring through his gold half mask. “And what if they burnTanimura to the ground, too? And every other town on the way? What if thosepeople are willing to devastate every city in the Old World just to deny me avictory? How long can we last?”Ruva gently stroked the skin on his intact cheek. “We will last as long as weneed to, beloved Utros. We are loyal to you.”Shimmering in front of them, Ava said, “I stayed with you even through death,didn’t I? Your soldiers are with you instead of in the underworld because theyhave sworn loyalty to you. This war will not end until you decide it ends.Victory is in your eyes, depending on how you define it.”Surrendering, he reached up to press Ruva’s palm against his cheek. For just amoment he let himself remember Majel’s delicate touch, the one time in his lifethat he had felt love and happiness, a time when he had believed in a perfectfuture for himself, for his lover, and for his emperor . . . a time when hehadn’t needed to choose between loyalty and love. Now Utros made all choices forhimself, to take from the Old World until there was nothing left.The core of his huge army camped up the river road on the other side of theholocaust, because there was no place for them in the soot and ash. Waiting toreceive orders from the general, Second Commanders Halders and Arros pressedEnoch for answers, and he told them to wait. The first commander presentedhimself in the general’s makeshift command structure. “The soldiers are ready,sir. You need only issue orders. Do we continue our march? Do we leave Renda Baybehind and press on? What will we do with the Norukai ships?”After a long moment, Utros said, “What I truly need are maps and scouts, andthen I can decide where to go.” He squeezed his hand into a fist.“You are a legend to us all, sir,” Enoch said. “Whatever you decide will be thecorrect tactical choice. We have lost many fighters in many skirmishes, and theenemy has proved to be far more troublesome than we expected, but your army canstill overwhelm any city. Especially if the Norukai help.”Utros stepped out of the building and looked across the blackened city, wherehis people waited for his guidance. He looked toward the bay, where he saw manyserpent ships gathered, including Grieve’s flagship, he assumed.He narrowed his eyes and nodded to himself. “Perhaps I need the Norukai morethan I thought, at least right now. We can use their charts, their supplies,their manpower. Then King Grieve and I can plan our attack on the rest of theland. I need to speak with him.”Ava’s spirit hovered in front of them. “In my spirit form, I can travel out tothe ships and tell King Grieve that you request a meeting.”“Yes,” Utros said, “but make certain he knows it is not a request.”*The serpent ships dropped anchor outside of Renda Bay beyond the stone siegetowers, as if wary that unseen defenders might still rain down projectiles andflaming arrows upon them.After Ava had communicated with the king, the Norukai dispatched a landing boatto retrieve General Utros and Ruva. They waited together while four Norukaiwarriors rowed up to the intact dock. The men gruffly acknowledged Utros whileleering at the slender, painted form of Ruva.She responded to them with a cold look. “You may want to have me, but you shouldbe afraid. The intense pleasure you would experience is bound to burst yourhearts.”Two of the Norukai grunted, but one bold warrior guffawed. “That would not be afighter’s way to die, but it is a man’s way to die.”The last of the men taunted her, “Or maybe the pleasure you receive from aNorukai would kill you first!”Utros had no patience for the banter. “Enough! Take us to King Grieve. We have awar to win.” These subhuman raiders appalled him, and he hated the fact that heneeded them—for now—to accomplish his goals.The raiders admired the burned remnants of Renda Bay. “You made your mark herealready. We have left many villages like that ourselves.”One snickered, “You may have Norukai blood in you after all.”Utros snapped, “Just row us out to the ship!”The landing boat reached the lead vessel, where a group of brash Norukai greetedthem on the deck above. King Grieve crossed his arms over his chest and receivedthem. “So, our armies have joined together after all! I am eager for this waryou promised me.”Utros climbed aboard. “We need to plan the best strategy for victory. Bring ameal, and we will talk in your cabin.”Grieve sniffed the air, relishing the stench of smoke that hung like a black fogover the harbor. “I enjoy the smell of a successful raid, and the destruction ofa weak town. I hope you plundered Renda Bay of everything those people hadbefore you burned it to the ground.”Utros was annoyed. “I did not burn it—I wouldn’t have been so foolish as todestroy such a valuable asset. The people laid traps before they evacuated andturned the town into an inferno as soon as we arrived.”The Norukai king guffawed. “Then your men must still be very hungry!”Utros clenched his fist at his side. He ground his teeth together so hard hecould feel his half mask shifting.The Norukai ships had full stores of salted and smoked fish, seaweed cakes, hardbreads, and barrels of ale they had brought from the main islands. Utros wishedhe could distribute all that food to his soldiers, but he had already made sucha request once, and if he asked King Grieve again, he would appear weak.“It is merely a setback. My army can keep moving. Tell us about the other citieswe will find up the coast. Which ones have the best plunder?” Utros said as theyentered the king’s cabin. “We need to pillage more. My soldiers must eat.”Sitting on a sturdy bench, Grieve gnawed on a haunch of some smoked meat. Theanimal didn’t seem familiar. He didn’t answer the question, preoccupied witheating.Utros and Ruva each received a block of smoked fish on a pewter plate, whichthey found satisfactory. The sorceress chewed in silence until she finallyasked, “Where is your shaman? Doesn’t Chalk guide your decisions?”“Chalk is dead.” The expression on the king’s horribly scarred face seemed tofall. “Now they all need to die. They all need to grieve.”“We still have to plan,” Utros said, impatient. How could the loss of thatsimpering albino ape come close to the pain he felt upon losing Ava, hisprecious and beautiful sorceress? “Renda Bay was a disappointment. We need tomarch and resupply.”Through the half-open door to the cabin, they could hear the boisterous shoutsand angry grumbles of the other Norukai on deck. A squarish, ugly woman namedAtta entered the cabin as if she belonged there. She carried another meaty bone,which Utros thought resembled part of a human arm. She ripped off a hunk offlesh and chewed with wet sounds.The hard bench squeaked under the big king’s weight as he shifted his position.“My warriors are more than ready. Lars has already raided several towns andvillages up there, and he can tell you which ones he left intact. There’ll belittle to scavenge from the ones he destroyed.”“The more he destroys, the more we will have to rebuild afterward. Tell him torestrain himself.”Grieve laughed as if the general had made a grand joke. “We will work togetherto conquer the Old World, but I still don’t know how we share the landafterward.”“Let us see what remains,” Utros said, “and then we divide it.”“Or we fight over it.” The Norukai king focused his attention on the bone in hishand, gnawing another scrap of red meat and gristle.Utros was glad that the gold mask hid half of his expression, and he struggledto keep his face blank. He set down his fork still bearing a hunk of smokedfish. “There is no need for that.”All the Norukai disgusted him, and he considered King Grieve to be even morefoul than Emperor Kurgan. He planned on enfolding the entire Old World into hisnew empire, and in doing so he could use the Norukai for their strength andtheir penchant for destruction, but his mind and his honor could not encompassan empire that included such subjects as these. After the war was won, he wouldfind a way to destroy King Grieve.Ruva glanced at him with a hard smile, as if she read his thoughts.“No need,” Atta said, sitting her wide hips on the bench beside Grieve, “but itmight be invigorating.” She reached over to touch the gash across the king’scheek. “I am trying to decide whether I should be your queen, Grieve, or if Ishould have an empire of my own.”“You will have whatever I give you,” he grunted.She blew softly into his face. “I can get what I want from you, my Grieve.”With his iron-plated fist he punched her in the center of the chest. The blowrocked her off the bench, but she grabbed the edge of the table and kept herbalance. She laughed and bashed him on the chin in return. Grieve lurched to hisfeet, dropping the bone as he spread his shoulders to flare the spiked spurs. Heheld Atta’s gaze for a long moment, then relaxed. “Later. When I bed down forthe night, we will continue our wrestling.”She laughed. “It will have to be in your cabin, my Grieve. We broke my bunk lastnight!” With an unsettling flirtatious glance, the Norukai woman sauntered outof the king’s cabin, still carrying her bone.Utros was impatient, grim and serious. He would make his careful plans everystep of the way, but this loathsome oaf did not seem to think ahead. “My army isready to march. Renda Bay is burned, and we must move soon. With our forcesunited, King Grieve, we could accomplish exactly what we need.”Grieve scoffed. “I have more than one hundred forty ships. That’s more than thecoast can handle. Your army can march inland along the old imperial roads, whilethe Norukai prey upon the coastal towns.”“We need more of a plan than that!” Utros said. “This is a war, not a game.”Grieve tossed down his bone, which was now stripped of meat. He drained atankard of ale while looking with displeasure at the general. “All war is agame, or else why bother?”Utros tried to control his impatience. “We must agree on a target. Our main goalshould be Tanimura, the heart of the Old World. That is the best way we candestroy the enemy.”Grieve crossed his massive arms over his chest. “Is there much to plunder inTanimura? I’ve barely heard of it.”Utros’s information was more than a thousand years out of date, but he remainedconfident. “Tanimura is filled with wealth and potential slaves, as many womenas you want. Once we capture and destroy that city, we will have won the war.”King Grieve grunted. “That is all the plan I need. We will each make our waynorth. After we strike Tanimura, we can take our time and pick clean the carcassof the Old World.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 66 [part0003.html#a7]When Nicci left the ruins of Effren, she directed the fast military ship to stopat Serrimundi so she could check on their defense preparations. From the tensionin the air, she knew they all took the threat seriously. Harborlord Otto haddispatched swift patrol ships beyond the rocky mouth of the harbor, and lookoutsremained on top of the bluff above the Sea Mother carving. Inside its shelteredharbor, the city remained watchful and safe.The lookouts had developed a simple but effective means of signaling at greatdistance, to spread any warning more swiftly. If any patrol ship spotted theNorukai fleet, they could drop and ignite rafts piled high with kindling, pitch,and green wood. The floating fires would produce greasy smoke visible from faraway, and the watchers on the bluff could sound the alarm to the city. Norukairaiders would never surprise Serrimundi again.When her expedition returned from Effren, they brought more refugees to join thecrowds that already strained Serrimundi’s resources. Nicci intended to head backup to Tanimura as soon as possible, but she would verify that Serrimundi wassecure before she left.The sheltered harbor remained a blur of activity. By now many of the sunkenwrecks had been dismantled to clear a passage for larger trading ships. Rowboatsand fishing vessels dodged the burned masts that still protruded from the water.Salvage crews continued to restore the docks while also building up the city’sdefenses.Nicci walked along the harborside in a new black dress, since her old one hadbeen patched and cleaned so many times it had fallen to tatters. The dress fither well, and she drew the attention of observers as she walked past. Now thather blond hair was growing out again, the strands tickled her neck.On the new wharf, she found Otto talking with Captain Ganley of the Mist Maiden,which had been too large to sail out safely through the sunken ships. Five otherlarge ships remained at anchor, waiting for their chance to leave, but they werenot idle. Salvage crews affixed sheets of beaten metal to the hulls as armor.The harborlord and Ganley stood beside a stack of crates taller than theirheads. Both men turned as Nicci approached. “Thanks to you, Sorceress, my MistMaiden will be a warship now,” said Ganley, “though I prefer peaceful tradingfrom port to port.”“Every ship needs to be a warship until the war is over,” Nicci said.Otto tugged on his wide-brimmed hat, shading his eyes. “By the end of the day,we’ll have a passage clear so the larger ships can leave the harbor.” He sighed.“Part of me just wants Ganley to take my daughter and her children away tosafety, so I can focus on guarding my city.”“They might be safe, but the rest of you wouldn’t be,” Ganley said. “I have mypart to play, as do we all.”“The Mist Maiden is too useful as a warship,” Nicci said. “It will serve as animportant defense at the mouth of the harbor if the Norukai make their way pastthe protective reefs.”She was pleased to see that hundreds of the initial Effren refugees were nowarmed and practicing maneuvers in an open area where two warehouses had burneddown during Kor’s raid. The men and women, still dressed in rags, worehodgepodge armor, chain mail, leather, even some plate. They fumbled throughtheir training, clumsily wielding swords, but getting better, hour by hour.Nicci nodded toward the recruits. “Their sheer numbers will help build a defenseforce if the Norukai come ashore here again.”“I intend to stop that from happening in the first place,” Harborlord Otto said.“With our new armored warships we will block the mouth of the harbor. They willnever get past the Sea Mother into the city proper.”Ganley set his jaw. “A line of five large vessels will prevent any invaders fromentering the harbor.”Nicci was impressed. “A significant improvement from how lax you were when Ibrought my first warning.”Leaving the two men, she walked to the next pier, where she saw an old man in aloincloth, his head shaved clean and his skin so tanned it looked like hardenedleather. With unexpected flexibility, he sat cross-legged on the end of thedock. Four young men dove underwater in front of him. Stone weights of varioussizes rested on the dock beside the old man, and the young divers each took oneand plunged deep, as if they were intentionally drowning themselves. After aremarkably long time, they would swim back up to the surface, struggling tocarry the weights. The old man gave a nod of appreciation when they returned thestones to the dock, but he offered little praise as their teacher.Nicci saw that his bare chest was covered with line after line of tattooedcircles, more than she could count. Her lips twisted in an instinctive frown.“You are wishpearl divers.”When he raised his head, ropelike tendons stood out on the old man’s neck. “I amthe best wishpearl diver. My name is Loren, and it is my burden to train thesewhelps and find out which ones have the lungs to follow in my path. Some of themdie.” He shrugged. “Then I have to go down to retrieve the stone weights myselfso the next trainees can use them. It’s quite a bother.”With an outburst of exhaled air, a young diver splashed back to the surface andslammed the stone weight on the boards in front of the old teacher. Loren said,“Obviously that was too easy. Try a heavy one next.” He handed the young diveran impossibly large stone, which instantly dragged him under.Nicci frowned at the rippling water. “I have had dealings with wishpearl diversbefore, not all of them positive. I am Nicci.”Loren snorted. “Everyone in Serrimundi knows who you are, Sorceress. Not all ofmy dealings with the divers are pleasant either. None of the trainees comesclose to my ability yet, so they have no reason to be arrogant.”“You sound overly proud of your own achievements,” she said.“Pride is perfectly acceptable when it is based on true accomplishment.”All five divers pulled themselves to the surface and hung on the end of thedock, looking at their trainer. “We did every task you set for us, Loren,” saida broad-faced young man. He looked up at Nicci with a predatory grin thatreminded her of a shark. She gave him a similar grin in return, and he flinched.“Then I will set you more tasks,” Loren said. “You aren’t exhausted enough.”Nicci turned to the old trainer. “Why don’t you tell them to work on the sunkenwrecks? Have them do something useful for their city.”One of the young men treading water said, “Wishpearl divers don’t do meniallabor!”Loren’s darkening expression instantly showed that the young man had given thewrong answer. “You will do whatever labor I tell you!” He pointed to histattooed chest. “You are not wishpearl divers until I say you are. You stillhave baby lungs! Inhale a bit of humility.”During the previous Norukai attack on Serrimundi, Nicci had shamed fourwishpearl divers into helping her. They had carried shielded bottles of wizard’sfire, which sank several serpent ships. It almost made up for her despicablefirst encounter with the arrogant men aboard the Wavewalker, when they hadpoisoned her and tried to rape her.Loren leaned over the end of the pier and barked down at his students, “Listento the sorceress. Go help with the work in the harbor. You will serveSerrimundi.”“Why should we do that?” sneered the arrogant diver. He kept glancing hungrilyat Nicci.She said, “Because you will receive something better than riches. You will proveyou are useful.” The trainees scowled at her as if that were the last thing thatinterested them. “And if the Norukai overwhelm Serrimundi, they will not beinclined to buy wishpearls . . . if any of you survive.”“Go, clear the sunken wrecks!” Loren commanded. “And when you are finished, Imay let you have women again.”Treading water, the divers scoffed at their trainer, “We are wishpearl divers!Women throw themselves at us.”Loren glared back. “Not if I spread the word that you all have the scabbydisease.”Appalled, the divers swam off toward the nearest sunken wreck in a rush to jointhe dismantling crews.The brass alarm gong rang out from the bluff above the Sea Mother, cuttingthrough the harbor activity. Even with the pounding of wooden mallets and theclang of armor plate, a hush fell across the waterfront. Nicci stared toward thelookout on the top of the bluff, who was waving his arms. “Is it the Norukai? Dowe have to fight again?”“No, not Norukai.” Loren cocked his head to listen. A percussive beat rang outthree times, then paused, then three times more. “Just cargo ships. Three ofthem.”“Three? Why would merchants sail together?” Nicci asked. “They are competitors.”Loren still sat cross-legged on the dock, baking in the sun. “I have not seen itbefore. This must be something unusual.”Before long, as the ships sailed through the narrow mouth into the shelteredharbor, Nicci learned that they had come up the Phantom Coast all the way fromRenda Bay.And that they carried Nathan, Bannon, and others from Ildakar.*Captains Mills, Straker, and Donell anchored the ships near the tall carving ofthe Sea Mother and dispatched rowboats to bring representatives to the docks.Though she covered it well, Nicci felt as astonished as a little girl when shesaw the erudite wizard with long white hair aboard the first boat. He wore aruffled shirt, long cape, and vest. Behind him sat the ginger-haired swordsmanBannon Farmer and the morazeth Lila in her distinctive black leather. Nicci hadnever expected to see them again. She couldn’t guess how they had come toSerrimundi, on the other side of the Old World from where she had last seenthem.Nicci could see that Nathan had never expected to see her either. As the rowboatpulled up to the dock, Bannon lurched to his feet, rocking the boat and wavingvigorously. “Nicci! I can’t believe you’re here.”Lila grabbed the young man’s wrist to steady him. “I would be angry if you felloverboard and drowned now, boy. I’ve worked too hard to keep you alive.”When the boat was tied up, Bannon sprang onto the dock, unable to stop himselffrom giving her an enthusiastic hug. “I missed you, Nicci! We’ve been through somuch. I know you were worried about me.”“Not overmuch.” Despite her words, Nicci was glad to see him, too. Her voicecaught in her throat, and then she let herself embrace him, a hug that he gladlyreturned. “I am pleased that you’re alive, but I’ve been otherwise occupiedbuilding defenses, fighting Norukai, even clashing with General Utros.”She extricated herself from the hug, but had only a moment of relief beforeNathan also swept her into an embrace. “So have we!” the wizard said. “Much hashappened, and the war is right on our heels! I am so glad we’re reunited. Wehave a world to save.”“And with all of us together again, we have a much better chance of doing it!”Bannon said.Nicci’s stern resolve melted with relief, and she stopped fighting it. “I wasindeed concerned about you both. I thought we were separated forever. I was sureyou must be dead by now, or at least trapped beneath the shroud of eternity.”“We thought you might be dead, too. I’m so glad you’re alive!” Bannon grinned ather, and Lila gave him an annoyed sidelong glance.“I see we have many stories to tell,” Nathan said. “Renda Bay is destroyed, andso is Cliffwall. General Utros and his army marched across the land fromIldakar, and we couldn’t stop them.”Bannon blurted out, “The Norukai fleet struck Renda Bay at the same time, morethan a hundred ships. They are sailing northward to ransack the coast, andGeneral Utros will be marching along the imperial roads. I’d wager they allintend to strike Tanimura.”The observers crowded around them reacted with alarm and dismay. “How can wepossibly fight them?” asked Harborlord Otto.Nicci realized that Nathan, with his scholarly experience and his knowledge ofthe language of Creation, might be able to help her with Richard’s mysteriousbone box. She felt the cold grow more intense in her heart. “This is what I’vebeen waiting for all along.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 67 [part0003.html#a7]Rowboats brought the gifted passengers from the three ships to the Serrimundidocks, but the Renda Bay refugees remained aboard, waiting to find a new home.Harborlord Otto sent boats loaded with supplies, water barrels, and provisions,but his city simply couldn’t absorb thousands more refugees.While Nicci and Otto planned a public meeting to discuss the alarming newinformation, Bannon took Lila to explore the edge of the harbor and theheadlands. Past the docks, they walked along a gravel path toward the high bluffat the mouth of the harbor. He stared at the towering stone carving of the SeaMother that loomed high above the sea at the mouth of the sheltered harbor.“This figure is famous even on Chiriya Island,” Bannon said to her with a grin.“I never thought I would see the great Sea Mother of Serrimundi with my owneyes.”He turned to Lila, hoping she would share his sense of wonder. Her facialbruises had faded now and she looked beautiful . . . in the way a finely honedknife was beautiful. Ever since their escape from the Bastion, she had remainedclose to him, never letting the young man out of her sight. She insisted onprotecting Bannon even as they slept together in a narrow cabin aboard CaptainMills’s ship, although when he held her, Lila was hard rather than soft.Regardless, he would not have wanted any other companion.“You often speak of the Sea Mother, usually when you intend to swear,” Lilasaid.Standing beneath the imposing carved figure, Bannon craned his neck up thebluffside. He tried to imagine sculptors hammering away at the dark sea rock toreshape the natural formation into the beautiful and intimidating woman. “I’venever seen the actual Sea Mother myself, but it was said in times long past thatshe appeared like a goddess in a silvery form.”“She is beautiful,” Lila admitted grudgingly. Her tone carried more resentmentthan admiration.The giant feminine face looked benevolent, and the huge blank eyes stared beyondthe harbor toward the sea. The Sea Mother was there to protect Serrimundiagainst all enemies, although she had not batted an eyelash when the Norukaicame. Bannon knew that Nicci was the one who had saved the city.Walking along, he was pleased to rest his hand on the finely tooled leatherscabbard and the ornate sword that Nathan had given him. Never in his life hadhe imagined owning such a magnificent weapon. He had been so proud of Sturdy,which he’d purchased with his own coins. He had trained hard, holding theleather-wrapped hilt in his hand. He doubted that any other weapon would everfeel so natural, but he had to admit that Nathan’s sword seemed nearly asperfect.Happy for this respite before the next horrific battle, whenever it might come,he was glad to walk with lovely Lila. He felt like a different person, no longera young cabbage farmer who had escaped from a dreary existence on a backwaterisland, someone whose father had beaten him and murdered hismother . . . someone whose best friend had been abducted by Norukai slavers.No, that was the old Bannon. Now he had traveled widely and fought in greatbattles; he was filled with wonder and hardened by experience. Now he had cleanclothes, a full stomach, a fine sword that was worth a fortune, and a beautifulwoman, his trainer, his lover, who refused to leave his side. He could barelybelieve it himself. Bannon looked up at the majestic carving and muttered,“Sweet Sea Mother.” He smiled at his own words.Lila interrupted him with a bitter undertone, “You consider her too beautiful,boy, just like you fawn over Nicci.”“What?” Bannon blinked at her. “I fawn over Nicci?”“I have seen you. Your heart beats faster when you look at her. She isattractive, I admit, but so am I. Is my hair not blond enough? Her breasts arelarger than mine. Is that what you desire?” She tensed as if ready to attackhim.Bannon didn’t know what to say. A long time ago, he had indeed been smitten withNicci. He flirted with her, even brought her flowers in hopes of winning herheart—only to learn that those flowers were poisonous. Nicci had scoffed at hisintentions, and when he didn’t forget his silly crush, she had threatened tokill him. He chuckled at the memory. “Nicci? She terrifies me!”Lila drew the sword from her hip and with her other hand she took out the agileknife. Bannon knew full well how it could deliver surges of impossible pain. “DoI not terrify you, boy? Defend yourself, and maybe you’ll learn your lesson.”She lunged with her long blade, and it was all he could do to yank Nathan’sornate sword out of its scabbard in time to counteract her blow. Steel crashedagainst steel. Previously, Bannon had practiced with the new sword, fought in ashadow dance against imaginary opponents, but now Lila was serious. She struckagain, backed away, then slashed hard across his abdomen. She would have guttedhim, but he leaped back at the last instant. The swish of the blade’s pointkissed the fabric of his shirt. “Lila! What are you doing?”He defended himself with every bit of his skill. The fancy sword felt differentin his hand, and the balance was a little off. He adjusted his grip and broughtthe blade up in time to catch the shorter sword that Lila wielded. His wristvibrated with the blow.They continued to fight beneath the looming Sea Mother. Bannon’s boots slippedon the gravel path, and Lila pounced. She snapped, “You make me angry when youlust after other women.”“I wasn’t!” Bannon cried. She hacked at him twice more, but he successfullyblocked her. The sword felt better now, and his movements were smoother. “I’vethought of no one but you!”“Prove it,” she said, and struck again.Bannon barely blocked severe injuries, and Lila was relentless. He didn’t knowwhat she meant. As he continued fighting, however, the sword became a naturalextension of his arm. He studied Lila’s fighting technique, but he already knewher so well. He anticipated her strikes and counterstrikes. He panted heavilyand his arm was sore, although she had barely broken a sweat.He pushed himself harder until he finally saw the tiniest opening as her bladedipped. Bannon raised his sword to strike her head, but he turned the flat ofthe blade just enough to land a resounding blow on her skull.Lila staggered back and pressed her palm against the stinging pain. At a safedistance, she lowered her sword and turned to face him. Instead of seeing theexpected flash of anger in her eyes, Bannon saw admiration. “You fought well,boy, because I taught you well. I wanted you to prove yourself with that newsword. You need to realize that a weapon is just a weapon. You keep mopingbecause you lost Sturdy, but this blade will kill an enemy just as well. Now youknow it in your bones.”Bannon looked down at the sword. “You were doing that for practice? Justpretending to be jealous?”“I do not pretend,” Lila said. “Our bodies moved perfectly together while wesparred, though I prefer how our bodies move when we are in bed. You have nowconvinced me that I am the center of your attention. That is enough fightingbetween the two of us.” She turned him away from the stone Sea Mother and ledhim back down the gravel path away from the headlands. “I want to leave thiswoman who watches us. We will not need to fight like that again.”*The public meeting with ship captains, guard commanders, and city leaders tookplace that afternoon in a vacant warehouse. The wood and brick walls werescorched from Kor’s recent Norukai raid. Benches were brought in for seats, andcrates were lined up to provide a makeshift speaking platform.As representatives gathered to discuss the situation, Nathan took stock of thecrowd. General Zimmer and Captain Norcross represented the D’Haran expeditionaryforce that had originally marched down from Tanimura. Sisters Eldine, Rhoda, andMab jointly represented the Sisters of the Light, since they had not yet chosena new prelate. Nathan doubted they would ever find a woman who could replaceVerna.As she stood on the raised platform waiting for the audience to settle down,Nicci crackled with power and confidence. Perri, Olgya, and Oron, the giftedfighters from Ildakar, were also a force to be reckoned with. Townspeople fromSerrimundi gathered in the doorways and lined the walls of the warehouse,listening to what might be the most important meeting of their lives.Otto pounded a mallet against the wooden wall, and the resounding boom droppedthe crowd into silence. When they spoke to the audience, Nathan, Nicci, andGeneral Zimmer described the situation as they saw it. Oron and Olgyainterjected with their own experiences, and Bannon also joined in, talking atlength about the awful Norukai. As misery dripped from his voice, town leaderThaddeus told how Renda Bay had been burned to the ground in order to stallGeneral Utros and kill as many of his soldiers as possible.Jared, the cocky krakener captain, called out, “So how soon will the Norukaicome for us? If they followed you after Renda Bay, they could be here any daynow.”“The pursuit broke off swiftly,” said Captain Mills, sounding proud. “Thewizards sank their lead ship, and Olgya hid our ships in a fog bank. The rest ofthe serpent ships withdrew to Renda Bay, as far as we could tell. Our fishingboats found refuge in coves and smaller towns up the coast, but we sailed hereat top speed to sound a warning.”Zimmer scratched the side of his cheek. “The Norukai are in no hurry. They willattack and ransack other villages along the coast as they make their way north,and General Utros’s army will take some time to march across the land.”Otto said, “If the army travels along the old imperial roads to reach Tanimura,they may well bypass Serrimundi, because the roads swing inland. That’s onereason why our city remained mostly independent from the Imperial Order. We wereout of the way. Maybe we don’t need to worry about General Utros.”“Oh, good,” Jared chimed in sarcastically. “More than a hundred serpent shipsshould give us no trouble at all.”“We have enough to worry about,” Nicci said. “I believe Tanimura is theirprimary target. Up there General Linden is building defenses with the D’Haranarmy, the Tanimura militia, and countless vengeful refugees. He has formed asignificant navy to guard the harbor as well as a large army. Tanimura isprepared to put up a strong resistance.”Zimmer nodded. “Linden is a good commander, but I’m still anxious to get back tomy garrison and consolidate our armed forces.”Captain Donell said, “My ship is full of people from Renda Bay, and supplieswon’t last forever. If we can’t unload the refugees here in Serrimundi, I’llneed to move on to Tanimura, and soon.”Captain Mills said, “I’ll take my ship up there as well.”“The Mist Maiden is armored and I can use it to guard the mouth of SerrimundiHarbor,” said Captain Ganley. “We have several vessels in place, but we coulduse another large ship to form a blockade and hold off an invasion if it comes.”Captain Straker said, “I’ll stay here. My sister lives in Serrimundi.”Oron and Perri looked at each other, and then Oron called out, “The two of uswill ride with Captain Mills and join the defense of Tanimura.”“Then I will stay here and help protect Serrimundi,” Olgya offered. “This is notIldakar, but it seems a fine city.”Nervous, Harborlord Otto looked to Nicci. “You are a powerful ally, Sorceress.Please stay. Serrimundi needs you.”“That’s not why I’m staying,” Nicci said. “I want to intercept King Grieve assoon as possible. I’m ready to fight.”Bannon piped up, “I’ll be with Nicci.” He blushed and glanced quickly at Lila.“Both of us will.”The morazeth woman said in a firm voice, “I am staying with Bannon Farmer.”“I would hate to break up our group of companions again,” Nathan said. “Butbefore we can truly prepare, we have to know where the Norukai fleet is, howfast they are coming, how far they have sailed.”Nicci called to all the gathered captains and townspeople. “I want to sail southin the swiftest ship until we encounter the raiders. Who will take me directlyto the Norukai fleet? We need to know where they are.” Her smile became hard.“We will harass them, provoke them, and get them to bypass Serrimundi, maybelure them all the way to Tanimura where the real defenses lie. We can crushthem, once and for all.”The people from Serrimundi let out sighs of relief and hope.The krakener captain stood up from his bench. “The Chaser is at your disposal,Sorceress. You know how fast my ship is, and my crew knows those waters well. Weoften hunt krakens there. We can sail from Serrimundi as soon as you wish.” Hegrinned. “Or as soon as we clean up a little for our guests.”“That won’t help a bit,” Otto muttered."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 68 [part0003.html#a7]Thousands upon thousands of weary soldiers marched onward, creating a low rumbleacross the land. The army’s progress did not pause, mile after desperate mile.Individual men faltered, but the main group, the single-minded ancient fightingforce, moved on. After crossing the continent, the soles of their boots wereworn to ribbons, their feet bloody. Their skin was sunburned and stretched tightagainst their bones from malnourishment. They stripped the land of any edibleshred.General Utros looked back at the dust cloud raised by the endless ranks. He sawthe hollow yet stony expressions on their faces, sunken eyes staring ahead,intent on their goal, intent on their leader. They did not complain, partlybecause of the numbing preservation spell, but primarily because they stillbelieved in Utros. They would march all the way to Tanimura and capture thegreat city, which would allow him to anchor his empire from Orogang across thecontinent and up to the New World.Utros held his head high even under the weight of the helmet. He would not lethis men down. Fifteen centuries ago, they had laid siege to Ildakar, and afterreawakening they had battled their way over the mountains, across the valleys,and all the way to the sea. That in itself was a victory, but General Utroswanted more. They marched north along the imperial road toward their real prize.Ruva rode beside Utros on her bay mare, but she seemed in a trance. Although heinsisted that she eat well, the sorceress seemed gaunt, even wasted. Her voicewas quiet above the plodding hooves of the horses. “Do you think Ava will be inTanimura? I miss my sister.”Utros frowned. “Ava’s spirit appears whenever she wishes.”“I haven’t seen her in so long.” The vibrant paint that marked Ruva’s body wassmeared and flaked off in patches, which disrupted the arcane loops of thespell-forms the twins had so carefully painted on each other.More disturbingly, he saw a faint fuzz of hair, tufts of stubble that showed howRuva had not maintained the exquisitely careful shaving of her body. Her eyeshad a distant and disturbing hint of madness. “Will Emperor Kurgan be inTanimura, I wonder? I will help you defeat him, beloved Utros.”“Iron Fang is no longer our enemy. We have others to conquer,” Utros said, thenadded an edge to his voice. “I need you, Ruva. You are my sorceress, the onlyone left.”Her disturbed eyes flicked back and forth. “No . . . no. We are both here. Avawill come back. The Keeper doesn’t have her yet.”He clenched his jaw, grinding his molars together as if to crush any unwisewords before they came out. The scarred half of his face stretched tight. “Ineed your focus. I need your magic.” He softened his tone. “And I need yourcompanionship.”Ruva blinked and came back to herself. She shook her head. “You shall have it. Ifeel stretched thin without my sister. She is here and yet not here. Part of myHan is frayed, but she will make me whole again if she comes back.” Ruva liftedher head and shouted out in a raw voice, beseeching the sky, “Ava, where areyou? The Keeper cannot have you yet. He can’t have either of us.”After finding no respite in Renda Bay, the ancient soldiers had leveled whatremained of the town, sifted fruitlessly through the ashes, and then watched thefleet of serpent ships gather again and set off. The Norukai could offer littleassistance to the landbound troops, nor did they have much interest in doing so.King Grieve would revel in his newfound war, raiding town after town as he movednorthward. Utros’s soldiers would take much longer to reach Tanimura. Theyneeded to move at a forced march and hope to reach that great city by the timethe Norukai raiders arrived.Rather than working their way along the rugged coast, they moved inland, wherethey found a direct but long-abandoned imperial road. Utros was glad to find itstill existed. Such roads were not meant to be trade routes, but straight-linethoroughfares by which Sulachan had led his armies up to the New World and hiswar with the wizards there.The old roads were overgrown, the paving stones buckled and shifted with time,but the route was plain, a direct way to Tanimura. “It has been a long timesince a conquering army passed this way,” he mused.Behind him the army trampled everything in their path as they moved on and on.Finally, in response to Ruva’s summons, a flickering shape appeared in the air.The green-limned spirit of Ava drifted in front of the horses. “I am here,” shesaid in her hollow voice, “but it grows more difficult to hang on each day.”Ruva opened her arms to her twin as she sat in the saddle. The spectral formintensified even as Ruva weakened; then Ava’s form dimmed and Ruva drew strengthin return. “We are connected, sweet sister.”“We are being torn apart,” Ava said. “The Keeper wants us both, and the more Ideny him, the harder he pulls.”“The Keeper wants us all,” Ruva said.The spirit separated again and hovered before Utros. She extended a slender armand pointed back toward the endless lines of troops. “The Keeper calls them. Heknows them. They can’t forget that their place is in the underworld.”“Their place is with their general. And they will keep marching.”Behind them the troops plodded onward in uneven ranks. Weak and exhausted, someof them collapsed, falling to the flattened road. The dazed comrades behind themtrampled the bodies, while others, ravenous, fell upon them, tearing off theancient leather armor and devouring the flesh down to the bones.Ruva laughed with an irrational edge in her voice. “See, the Keeper claims hisown!”“The Keeper will have to be satisfied for now.” Utros lowered his voice. “Healready has Emperor Kurgan, and he has Majel, but I have this world for now, andI swore to conquer it. I need my army. My place is here.” He raised a fist tothe sky. “I will hold on until I have accomplished my task!”Ava’s spirit let out a strained laugh that was eerily echoed by her twin sister.“The Keeper pulls us all closer to the veil. He will wait, but he will not bedenied forever.” Her faint spirit stretched and pulled, and she reached ayearning arm toward Ruva. Her twin tried to grasp her, tried to hold on, but Avawavered like an image imprinted on smoke. Her spirit vanished.Utros and Ruva rode on alone. Under his breath, he promised the Keeper, “I willbring you many more souls, if you will just wait . . . wait.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 69 [part0003.html#a7]True to his word, Captain Jared readied the Chaser for departure within thehour. In recent weeks, the ship had ferried many refugees up to Tanimura,rescuing survivors from ruined towns, and delivering emergency supplies. Thistime, Jared would sail south on a reconnaissance mission until they encounteredthe Norukai fleet, and then the Chaser would race back with a report.While docked in Serrimundi Harbor, the captain had added armor plating to hisship. The krakener was dirty and stained, nothing much to look at, but the newcopper plates made the ship look gaudy.As they sailed out of the harbor and past the line of reefs, Nicci remained ondeck, letting the evening breezes ruffle her hair. Even brisk winds didn’tentirely drive away the ever-present fishy smell. Nathan, Bannon, and Lilajoined her, staring into the deepening darkness.Nathan, always confident and pleased with himself, was even more so now that hewas back with his companions. Even aboard the dingy ship, he wore a fine shirt,new vest, and embroidered cape. His long white hair drifted about as he facedthe breeze. “Though the future is dire, I am glad to be with you again,Sorceress. Richard made me promise to take care of you, and I would hate todisappoint him.”Nicci raised her eyebrows. “He sent me to keep you out of trouble, and now we’vegot an entire war on our hands.”“It is not a war that we started, dear Sorceress, but it is a war we willfinish.”Bannon patted the scabbard at his hip. “And I’ll fight at your side. They willbe no match for us.”Nicci recognized the ornate blade that Nathan had carried from D’Hara. “You gavehim your sword?”“The boy needed a new weapon, so I accommodated him.”Bannon’s expression sagged. “King Grieve threw Sturdy overboard. I loved thatsword, and now it’s at the bottom of a river.” He drew his new blade and lookeddown at the gleaming steel. “But I love this one just as much! It is a wizard’ssword.”“The boy has earned a decent weapon after all he’s done,” Nathan said. “Now thatI have my gift back, I can make do with an ordinary sword.” He patted thestandard military blade at his side.Lila managed to place herself between Bannon and Nicci. “The blade is what killsthe enemy, not its appearance.” She glanced at Nathan. “Nor its cost.”When full darkness set in and the Chaser cruised through open water, CaptainJared rang the bell to get the attention of the crew. “We will serve dinner,fine kraken meat to impress our esteemed guests!”One of the crew members joked, “I thought we were going to use that meat to killthe Norukai when we found them.”Jared took mock offense, and the rest of the crew laughed. He presented plattersof the meat in grayish puddles of “special” sauce, which he explained was arecipe that his mother had concocted to make the kraken meat taste delicious.“You mean palatable,” yelled another one of the crewmen. They laughed again.Nathan tasted the dish with trepidation, while Lila and Nicci ate their mealswithout comment. “Better than fish guts,” Bannon observed, as if it were acompliment, and then he spoke at length about how his mother used to cook krakenmeat with cabbage on Chiriya Island.Jared sat on a crate on the open deck and grew serious as he leaned forward,meeting Nicci’s eyes. “My crew and I are glad to have this important mission.Krakeners put up with a lot of ribbing from other sailors. We know that our shipsmells. We know that fancy cargo vessels are cleaner and more comfortable, andwe even know that some people don’t like the taste of kraken meat. But we areloyal citizens, and we will fight to defend our land.”Later that night, after the crew had quieted, Nicci took Nathan aside. “On myprevious visit, I did dispatch a message up to the People’s Palace to informRichard about this terrible war. I asked him to send help, but apparently he’sinvolved in some crisis of his own up in D’Hara. He didn’t explain.” Herexpression darkened. “He is, however, confident that I can handle any problemshere in the Old World.”Nathan’s nostrils flared. “You mean that we can handle any problems.”Nicci produced the small bone box and extended it to him. “Richard told me thisis all I would need. I cast a verification web, poked and prodded with my gift,but I still don’t know what it is. Maybe you can help me figure it out.”Curious, the wizard took the bone box and inspected each side. “These markingsare the language of Creation. ‘Life to the living. Death to the dead.’ ”Cautiously, he pried open the lid and let out a whistle of amazement when he sawthe glowing pearl of magic that twisted and rolled and rippled. “Itis . . . hmmm, I believe it’s a constructed spell.”Nicci nodded. “But I don’t know what it does or how to trigger it. I am missingthe key. Richard thinks I will understand what I’m supposed to do.”“Given time, I might be able to decipher it. I have some familiarity withconstructed spells.”“As do I, but so far this has baffled me.”Nathan turned the bone box back and forth in his hand, then handed it back toher. “We can work on the puzzle together, but if Richard says this is all youneed, then I’m sure you are up to the task. Meanwhile, we have other ways tofight the enemy.” He gazed ahead of them across the dark sea. “As soon as wefind those serpent ships.”*For the next few days, Nicci and Nathan augmented the southerly winds, whichdoubled the speed of the Chaser. Jared’s crew kept a sharp lookout for theraider fleet, but the ocean remained quiet. Nicci and Nathan scrutinizedRichard’s complex constructed spell, but came up empty-handed.By the third day, the crew aboard the ship became anxious, and the captain’saloof demeanor grew tense. To burn off their restlessness, Lila and Bannonsparred across the deck, while Nathan stared toward the watery horizon.Nicci stepped up to him. “I’m anxious to find the Norukai, but every mile we gowithout encountering them means they are that much farther away. Serrimundi andTanimura have extra time to build their defenses.”“Sweet Sea Mother, we’re ready to fight!” Bannon said, resting his sword tip onthe deck. “Right now.”The shirtless lookout dangled from high on the mainmast. He called out, “Smoothwater ahead, Captain! Mirror water!” The crew suddenly became energized, and thecaptain grinned with anticipation.Nicci followed the lookout’s urgently pointing hand, where an unusual andunnatural smooth patch of water looked like glass. “What does it mean, Captain?”“That’s a sure sign a kraken is just below the surface!” He barked orders to thecrew while he himself ran to the captain’s wheel, altering course. “We can’tmiss an opportunity like this. It’s right in front of us.” His chest swelled ashe inhaled a deep breath. “It’s time we remembered we’re krakeners!”The crew gathered ropes, harpoons, and weighted nets, moving with the efficiencyof long practice. Excited, they shifted their weapons from one hand to anotherand flexed their muscles.As the Chaser approached the oddly smooth water, a smooth green tentacle brokethe surface and curled upward, then sank again, cresting barely a ripple. Thekraken hunters howled out a challenge. One overeager man hurled his harpoon,which fell far short, and he promptly reeled in the rope hand over hand to gethis weapon back.The tentacle was smooth and covered with slime, mottled with leopard spots.Another tentacle glided out of the water, and then four more tentacles arose,each one covered with suckers. Their movements were languid, as if the creaturewere merely stretching in the ocean air.“Will it attack?” Nathan asked.The crew laughed at the suggestion, and Jared rolled his eyes. “Krakens aredocile beasts that graze on seaweed. They squirm a lot when you kill them, butthey’re not the monsters people think they are.”As the Chaser closed in, the crew gathered at the rail, cocking their arms andreadying their harpoons. Other crew members held ropes and nets. It was acoordinated effort, as if they were soldiers about to go into battle.“I count seven tentacles,” Bannon said. “How many does a kraken have?”Jared waved his hand. “However many it likes, and the more tentacles they have,the more meat we can harvest.”“We’re in range, Captain!” the lookout called.The sailors needed no more encouragement. Like archers launching a volley ofarrows, they hurled their harpoons into the glassy water. Seven of the jaggedspears splashed uselessly in the sea, while four sank into tentacles.The thing was like a spider startled in the center of its web. One of thelaughing sailors wrapped his rope around his waist, and the kraken’s reflexivejerk nearly pulled him overboard, but two of the man’s friends grabbed him intime and pulled him back.More harpoons struck as the Chaser closed the distance. The sailors pulled onthe ropes, while the struggling kraken yanked back. The ship’s hull strained andcreaked against the monster’s mighty tug. Two of the new armor sheets poppedloose with a clang.A forest of tentacles flailed upward, dripping slime. As it rose to the surface,Nicci could see that the kraken’s body core was a sphere with a hard shell likea crab’s, and the tentacles extended outward like the spokes of a wheel. Severalharpoons struck the shell and bounced off.One tentacle quested forward, trying to grasp the people on deck. Bannon duckedas the sucker-rimmed tip barely missed him. Nathan chuckled, but didn’t notice asecond tentacle that slashed sideways. The rubbery arm caught him a resoundingblow and sent him sprawling. He smashed against a large crate and cracked hishead, leaving him stunned. The wizard’s long white hair was matted with krakenslime as well as a blossom of blood.Bannon hurried over to help. Nathan groaned and picked himself up, pressing apalm to his head. “I assure you I’m all right. Just a little rattled.” Hestruggled to his hands and knees on the deck, barely conscious. “I think I’llrest a bit.”The tentacles writhed around the ship, and the hunters continued to disabletheir prey. They hacked off any appendages that came close, leaving the creaturewith several stumps.Jared grinned at Nicci. “Feel free to use your gift, Sorceress. Couldn’t youstop its heart with a blast of magic?”“I would not wish to deprive you of your amusement,” Nicci said in a dry voice.“I will save my magic for fighting the real enemy.”The harpoon hooks embedded themselves in the rubbery hide. The sailors strainedagainst the ropes, pulling the wounded beast closer to the Chaser. They lashedthe ends around stanchions, holding the kraken in place. It struggled in itsdeath throes, flailing amputated tentacles. The crew would soon haul the carcassaboard and spend hours butchering it and storing the meat.Suddenly, the kraken jerked hard and vanished beneath the surface, straining theropes and the hooks as it submerged.“It’s getting away!” one of the sailors bellowed.“That’s not possible,” Jared said. “Something is pulling it down!”The men doubled up to haul harder on the ropes, but the kraken was dragged underas if caught in a tug of war. “There’s something deep underwater.”Bannon held his sword, looking over the side, with Lila beside him ready tofight. Nathan huddled on deck, groaning as he held his bleeding head.Jared ordered, “More harpoons! I don’t want to lose our prize!”The hunters grabbed spears, but the kraken sank out of view with an even sharperjerk. Harpoon hooks tore free, ripping out chunks of the slimy hide. Ropessnapped and spun loose of the stanchions. A gush of blood blossomed around thesubmerged kraken, and the mirror water began to churn. The crew cried out inunison as the waves exploded.The frilled head of an enormous sea serpent rose up, as large as a dinghy and asfearsome as a dragon. Its giant jaws clamped down on the squirming kraken, andtentacles flopped about like worms in its mouth. When the sea serpent cruncheddown on the armored body core, green fluid spurted out.Bannon backed away, bumping into Lila. “It’s the serpent god!”Lila drew her short sword and stood next to him, ready to fight. “Perhaps KingGrieve sent it here.”The monster opened its jaws, tossed the dying kraken up into the air, thengulped the morsel down before turning its slitted eyes down toward the Chaser.The krakener crew scrambled about, but they had no place to hide.The monster flared its spiked frills and let out a bellowing hiss. The spraydrenched everyone on the ship, and the lookout tumbled from his perch on themast, barely catching himself on a rigging rope.“I’ve fought dragons before,” Nicci said, looking up at the enormous seaserpent. “This is no different.”Nathan struggled to his feet, bleeding from the blow to his head. “I’ll offerwhat assistance I can, Sorceress.”The serpent god wheezed out as it loomed over the Chaser. Nicci summoned alightning bolt that scorched a smoking line down its sinuous body. With a roar,the serpent god lunged down and bit the side of the ship, splintering wood. Thecrew threw their harpoons, but their spears did little damage to the scaledhide.Nicci recalled when she had fought the dragon Brom, using the Subtractive sideof magic. Now she extended her gift and easily found the serpent god’s heartnear the top of its long neck. The heart was as large as a barrel, beating hard.She unleashed her gift, caused the muscle to swell and darken . . . then burst.The serpent writhed backward, arching its jaws toward the sky in agony.But even after Nicci had exploded its heart, the monster struck again, sweepingits great neck sideways to snatch a panicked crewman in its jaws. With onechomp, it bit the man in two and tossed the pieces into the water.Nicci couldn’t believe the creature still lived. “I stopped its heart!” Shereached out with her magic again, then realized to her surprise that thiscreature had more than one heart.Once she concentrated, she discovered six hearts down the length of its body,each one independent, each beating to keep the underwater monster alive. “Thenmy work has just begun.” She lashed out with her destructive magic, findinganother heart and stopping it. She burned a third heart to a lump of internalcharcoal.Each time Nicci hurt it, the creature recoiled and smashed into the ship,causing even more damage. The Chaser would not last long.Groaning and still dazed, Nathan managed to summon a ball of wizard’s fire andhurl it at the serpent god’s head. The searing magic flames burned between thecreature’s jaws and roasted its tongue.Nicci didn’t stop her attack. With methodical intensity, she destroyed all ofthe monster’s remaining hearts, one by one. At last, the giant serpent collapsedonto the water, causing waves that rocked the kraken-hunter ship. The deadserpent god floated in the sea, longer than two or three ships.Jared and his crew stared in dismay. The captain dropped to his knees andtouched the bloodstain on the deck where his crewman had been killed. Bannon andLila stood shaken, holding their swords ready as if some other monster mightemerge from the deep.Unsteady on his feet, Nathan placed a hand on Nicci’s shoulder. She knew it wasmeant to be reassuring, but he seemed to be steadying himself. “Sorry I couldn’tbe more assistance.”“The serpent god is dead, Nathan. We killed it.”High up on the mast, the bedraggled lookout squawked, “Ships! Norukai ships onthe horizon!”Far out on the water, Nicci saw more than a hundred ominous vessels sailingtoward them. From afar, the raiders had seen Nicci kill their serpent god, andeven at a distance she could hear their howls of outrage. All the oars wereextended, churning the water, so the serpent ships approached at great speed.Nicci crossed her arms over her chest. “We have found them at last.” She felt adeep chill upon seeing the size of the fleet. “Turn your ship about, Captain.Quickly! Back to Serrimundi with all possible speed.”Still unsteady, Jared shouted for the crew to reset the sails as he spun thewheel to turn the rudder. Though exhausted from battling the sea serpent, Niccicalled up her gift, and Nathan assisted her as best he could. Together, theycreated a wind as strong as a storm to help the ship flee. The Chaser raced awaywith the Norukai fleet in pursuit."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 70 [part0003.html#a7]When his ships came upon the floating carcass of the serpent god, King Grievestared down into the water, sickened and enraged. This fresh agony felt asstrong as the pain he had experienced upon seeing his beloved Chalk murdered.From the prow of his flagship, Grieve had watched the ugly kraken-hunter vesselwith its gray sails and metal-plated hull, and he would never forget that ship.He had seen the sorceress strike down their serpent god. He would hunt it to theend of the world, if necessary.But he could not simply sail past the body of their fallen serpent god. “Dropanchor! All ships. We halt here.”Drums pounded, and shouted orders ricocheted across the water. The Norukai shipssailed close enough together that the staccato commands passed from ship toship. With oars extended, Grieve’s ship maneuvered close to the drifting deadmonster, where they dropped anchor stones and tied up the sails to keep thevessels in position.Grieve had sacrificed to the serpent god many times. Now, he squeezed hismassive hands against the rail until the wood creaked with the strain. Thespikes in his shoulders protruded. He opened his jaws wide and roared with allthe air in his lungs, all the power in his voice, a loud inhuman cry, much likethe sound made by the serpent god.The rest of the Norukai did the same, and the din was like a thunderclap thatwent on and on as one crew after another took up the howl. Grieve wanted blood,needed blood. He would find the sorceress and tear out her throat with his ownteeth. First, though, he and his raiders would repay the serpent god for thegrace and strength it had given them.The monster’s body floated motionless just off the bow. Grieve looked down atits magnificent head, the frilled fin, the triangular jaw that was now a burnedhorror from wizard’s fire. One milky eye stared upward, half closed.“The serpent god is dead,” moaned one of the raiders beside Grieve.The king bashed him on the side of the head, and the man reeled away, clutchingthe blood that streamed down his face. Grieve snarled, “The serpent god isalways here. The serpent god is us.”He drew the long gutting knife from its sheath, swung himself overboard, anddropped down into the water. He plunged into the waves near the dead seaserpent.As the raiders peered down from above with dismay and curiosity, the king swamto the scaled form and wrapped his muscular arm around it, holding on like alover’s embrace. The pale underbelly turned upward as the body drifted on thesloshing waves.Grieve hauled himself along its length, using the scales and fins for handholds.In all of history, no one else had been so close, so intimate with the serpentgod except for the blessed victims whose flesh it incorporated. But he wasGrieve, King Grieve of the Norukai! He was part of the serpent god, just as theserpent god was part of all of them.He pressed down on the scales, then rested his scarred cheek against the wetform. He closed his eyes and tried to draw the power into himself, absorbingwhat he could from the magnificent creature. “I am the serpent god. We all arethe serpent god,” he whispered to the dead form.The countless serpent ships had fallen eerily silent as the raiders watched him.Grieve plunged his long knife into the belly of the sea serpent. Aboard theships, the Norukai gasped and groaned, but he glared up at them. “This is whatwe must do!” He sawed farther, cutting a long incision. Entrails spilled out inwet ropes that drifted in the water. With so much blood, he knew that sharkswould come soon to feed, but Grieve and the Norukai would take what theyrequired first.He kept cutting until he found the first of the reptilian hearts. It was large,round, and purplish red. He hacked a chunk of the tough heart meat, which hestuffed into his mouth. He opened his scarred jaws wide to take in as much as hecould. Chewing, he tasted the tar of burned blood. The flavor was exquisite, butthe power was even more remarkable.He knew that Chalk was a part of the serpent god, too. The serpent god had fedon the shaman, and now that strength was flowing into the Norukai king.“I am the heart of the serpent god,” he yelled. “All my people must join me.” Hecut off another piece of the meat and raised it out of the water. “All Norukaimust be the heart of the serpent god.”Three raiders leaped overboard without further encouragement. Once theyunderstood what Grieve meant, others also jumped into the water and swam to theserpent god. With their own knives, they sliced the belly down its length tofind the other hearts.Atta was the first. The hefty woman swam up to Grieve and hacked off a piece ofthe heart for herself. After she chewed and swallowed, she turned herblood-smeared face to him and offered him another piece, which he accepted.More Norukai swarmed around the floating body, butchering the creature. Theyremoved the multiple hearts, some of which were charred and blackened, othersstill fresh and filled with blood. Every morsel contained the essence of thegreat deity. When the hearts were consumed, the raiders stripped the meat fromthe serpent’s bones. This was a feast unlike any they had ever experienced. TheNorukai had pillaged towns, stolen their food, raped their women, but nothingcould compare to this thrill.The water became a froth of red. The circling sharks were wary, unwilling toapproach the fierce Norukai.As the feast continued, Grieve’s shock was replaced with an intense confidence.The great serpent god might have been slain, but it was not a cause for sadness.This was a transformation, and he felt it swell within him. Around him, hundredsof raiders stripped the carcass and squabbled over the last morsels. EveryNorukai wanted to partake, though he knew that was not possible with the tens ofthousands of bloodthirsty warriors aboard their fleet.“You have eaten the heart of the serpent god,” Atta said as she floated next tohim, caressing the scar on his cheek with one bloody finger. “You are KingGrieve. You are all of us.”“Yes, I am all of the Norukai. I have fed on the heart of our god, and now Imyself am its living manifestation.”He and Atta swam back to their ship as the Norukai continued to work on thecarcass like seagulls tearing apart a bloated whale. When he climbed aboard hisship again, he caressed the carved figurehead. He raised his fists into the airand shouted, “I am the serpent god now. We are the serpent god, and we willstrike and kill.”He inhaled until his lungs were so full he felt his chest would burst, and thenhe exhaled a gigantic roar that rippled across the masts. All the Norukairesounded with their response.One serpent god might be dead, Grieve knew, but now there were many more serpentgods—elsewhere in the sea, and also in human form—and they were far more deadly.Yes, the world would grieve."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 71 [part0003.html#a7]Driven by the enhanced wind, the Chaser practically flew across the waves towardSerrimundi. The krakener pulled far ahead of the Norukai fleet, and the crewmade makeshift repairs from the sea serpent attack along the way.They could not reach Serrimundi fast enough to please Nicci. After seeing thenumber of serpent ships, she was convinced that even Serrimundi’s new defensescould not withstand such an attack. The much larger city of Tanimura might standa chance, with its full navy and strengthened army, but not Serrimundi. Effrenand Larrikan Shores had already been wiped out by a much smaller Norukai raidingfleet.Serrimundi was more than ten times larger than Renda Bay, however, and such acity simply could not be evacuated in only a few days. It seemed an impossiblesituation.She stood at the bow of the Chaser with Nathan, Bannon, and Lila, discussingoptions. Even with their speed and significant head start, Nicci doubted theywould have enough time to make the necessary preparations—whatever those mightbe. Together, they tried to develop a plan that would give Serrimundi the bestchance of survival.Just before the Chaser approached the line of reefs beyond the harbor mouth,they encountered one of the patrol boats. As they raced past, Nicci cupped herhands around her mouth and shouted, “Light your signal rafts. The Norukai are ontheir way!”The patrol boat’s crew dropped the floating platform overboard and lit the pileof green kindling to raise a column of smoke that could be seen for many miles.Other widely separated scout boats spotted the signal and replied in kind,lighting their own rafts to pass the message along and notify everyone in thecity. The lookout on top of the Sea Mother bluff hammered on her gong to soundthe alarm.Serrimundi was on full alert by the time the Chaser sailed past the Mist Maidenand four other armored cargo ships that defended the mouth of the harbor, justbeyond the towering stone carving. When the krakener pulled up to one of therepaired piers, Harborlord Otto, Lady Olgya, Captains Ganley and Straker, andother city representatives hurried to meet them.“The Norukai are maybe two days behind us,” Bannon blurted out. “We have to getthe whole city on high alert.”Otto nodded soberly. “We are as ready as can be. Everyone is armed and trained,the ships are reinforced with metal plates. We knew this might happen.”“You have made an admirable effort here, but alas we are convinced it will notbe enough to save Serrimundi,” Nathan said.Captain Ganley looked indignant. “Don’t underestimate us. Our people know thisis their only chance to save their homes. They will not give up without afight.”“It will be a battle such as the Norukai have never seen.” The harborlordcrossed his arms over his chest.“But you will still lose. Even if you inflict numerous casualties on theraiders, they will still burn your city to the ground,” Nicci said. “Tanimura’sdefenses are ten times stronger. They have built up a whole fleet of warshipsready to defend the sea, and their standing army includes a garrison fromD’Hara, thousands from the city guard, and countless refugee recruits. Oron,Perri, and the other gifted are already there with General Zimmer. Our bestchance is to lure the Norukai fleet directly to Tanimura, where they will bewiped out.”“But what about Serrimundi?” Otto asked, his voice cracking. “What are we todo?”“You may not need to fight at all,” Nathan said, touching a finger to his chin.“We have an idea to protect your city. Lady Olgya’s actions gave us the idea, infact.”The gifted woman from Ildakar was surprised. Her hair hung loose now, ratherthan in the familiar braids, with a ragged hunk where an enemy soldier had cutone off. “I inspired you? I am intrigued.”Otto looked from Nathan to Nicci. “I like the sound of that, but I don’tunderstand what you mean.”Leaving the krakener, Nicci walked down the dock, all business. She regarded therolling hills, the sections of the city that spread inland from the neat,protected bowl of the harbor. Her memory and her imagination had not failed her.“Yes, it is possible.”Otto and the others followed her as she walked the length of the pier, anxiousto hear what she would suggest. In front of the first line of warehouses Nicciturned and looked back at the harbor, the headlands, and the opening to the sea.“The Norukai islands are far to the south, and this is new territory for them.Before Captain Kor’s raid, Serrimundi had never before been attacked, so theNorukai know very little about your distant city. None of Kor’s raiders escapedalive, so no one was able to bring a report to King Grieve. He isn’t aware ofthe exact location of Serrimundi.”Nathan brushed the front of his new vest and adjusted his embroidered cape, asif he were about to step onto a stage. “If fate treats us favorably, we may beable to distract the Norukai and trick them into sailing right past Serrimundi.”“We want to hide your city,” Lila said, with as much inflection as if she weremerely remarking on the weather.Ganley gasped. “Hide Serrimundi? Where would you put it?”Nicci lifted her chin. “If we time it right, the Norukai might not see theharbor at all. Because we killed their serpent god, King Grieve is pursuing theChaser. He wants his vengeance on us. If we can provoke them, taunt them, andmake them keep chasing us, we might get the entire fleet to sail pastSerrimundi . . . if they don’t see the harbor in the night.”“How could they not see an entire city?” Otto removed his wide-brimmed hat andwiped perspiration from his brow. “I still don’t understand this.”But Olgya began to smile. Nicci looked to Captains Ganley and Straker, both ofwhom stood ready to follow her instructions. “If other armored ships join us aswe race away, King Grieve will keep following us.”“He wants to kill me, too,” Bannon said. “And Lila. We just have to keep theNorukai too preoccupied to look for Serrimundi. That’s why we can’t let them seethe city.”“We must camouflage it,” Lila said, as if impatient for the discussion to cometo the point.Amid the surprised gasps, Nathan held up a finger. “A sufficiently gifted personsuch as yourself, my dear”—he turned toward Olgya—“could summon a thick mist toblanket the mouth of the harbor, just as you hid our ships from the Norukaiafter Renda Bay, and outside the Cliffwall canyon before that. If the raidersdon’t know to look for Serrimundi, then the diversion should be straightforwardenough. Before that, we need to stall and harass the raider fleet, make surethey arrive at night and sail past this part of the coast. . . .”Nicci turned to Otto. “Harborlord, you’ll need to darken the city tomorrow andeach night until the Norukai pass. No one can light fires or lanterns aftersunset. Serrimundi must be pitch black when the serpent ships come after us.”“But my city wants to fight too!” Otto said. “Are you suggesting that we hidehere in the fog and let Tanimura handle the war for us?” The lines in his facedeepened. “Sorceress, you gave a grand speech that all the cities of the OldWorld must pull together against our overwhelming enemy. Serrimundi can’t justsit by and let Tanimura face it themselves! We are not cowards.”“I’m not suggesting that you do nothing.” Nicci’s lips took on a hard smile.Bannon rested a hand on the ornate pommel of his new sword, and his grin wasenthusiastic. “After the Norukai chase after us in the dark, the rest ofSerrimundi’s warships can follow all the way to Tanimura. When the battle beginsthere, you can strike them from behind.”Lila added with a grim smile, “If you stay far enough back, King Grieve willnever expect you.”“A large curtain of mist . . .” Olgya twisted her long hair in her fingers.“While you lead them away like a fox on a hunt, I can create a thick fog bank tohide Serrimundi.” She looked out to the towering figure of the Sea Mother on thebluff. “And that is just to start. . . .”*The following day, knowing the Norukai fleet was fast approaching, the krakenhunter sailed away from Serrimundi followed by four armored cargo ships.Serrimundi scout boats ranged farther south, prepared to light their signalrafts as soon as they spotted King Grieve and his raiders.Left behind, Olgya watched them go, vowing to do her part to save the city.Harborlord Otto had dispatched runners throughout the city, issuing a completeban on fires, lanterns, not even a candle behind a shutter for the coming night.When darkness fell, Serrimundi had to be invisible, swallowed up in darkness andfog. Olgya had practiced her spell to call up the mists in the sea.Near sunset, the lookout on the bluff spotted a curl of signal smoke to thesouth, which meant the raiders would be here within hours. Ready to intercept,the Chaser and the four sailing ships angled swiftly toward the smoke to provokethe oncoming Norukai fleet. They would taunt the serpent ships and bolt away,sailing north, leading them toward Tanimura for the final battle.More than an hour later, near full darkness, the provocateurs sailed back pastthe harbor, pushed by magically enhanced winds. As deepening night blanketed theharbor and city with gloom, Olgya got to work before the Norukai could heaveinto view in hot pursuit. Waiting beneath the Sea Mother carving at theheadlands, she used her gift to touch countless droplets of water, raising amist from the calm waves beyond the mouth of the harbor. At first it was likefaint steam rising from a pot of water about to boil, then it thickened intolacy wisps of fog that coalesced with other strands into a low-lying blanket.The mist rolled up and into the harbor, blanketing the hills, flowing along thecoast, and extending out to sea. Even as the darkness thickened, no lightstwinkled from any homes in the crowded city. Olgya thought of families huddledtogether in the dark, comforting one another. The night had an unnatural hush.Back at Ildakar, she had watched her glorious city vanish behind the shroud ofeternity; now she had to make another city disappear, but in a different way.Olgya thickened the mist around the mouth of the harbor so the Norukai would seenothing but a blurred coastline, if they could make out anything in thedarkness. As the last gloom faded into deep night, she spotted the blue sails ofmore than a hundred serpent ships racing after the Chaser and the four armoredcargo ships. The enemy fleet was dizzying in its size, but Olgya had seen itbefore, at Renda Bay. She now saw the sense in Nicci’s plan; no matter how hardthe people might fight back, these ships would have destroyed all ofSerrimundi’s defenses, filled the harbor, and burned the city to the ground.Even if the trick worked, however, Olgya intended to make her mark here.As the thick fog spread and settled, Olgya took a dinghy and rowed out of themouth of the harbor. The currents were erratic, but she used her gift to steadythe boat as she made her way out to the long line of dangerous reefs beyond theharbor.Rowing hard, she picked her way along the foamy line until she chose a place tolay down another deadly trap. She created a small shimmering ball of light,flickering cold flames that were tightly layered like the petals in a rosebud.She laid the glowing kernel among the reef rocks, ducking from the spray hittingthe rocks. Her little spark glimmered there, immune to the water that tried todouse it. This wasn’t normal fire, but would become a beacon bright enough thatshe hoped it would lure some of the oncoming Norukai ships right to the Keeper.Finished, she rowed back to the sheltered harbor, confident the trick wouldwork.Out on the reefs, her enigmatic light grew brighter in the fog.*Lars stood at the bow and howled into the night, shouting a challenge at thefleeing ships. The Chaser sailed ahead into the darkness.He remembered Nicci from Ildakar. Now the blond sorceress kept provoking theraider fleet by lashing out at them with bolts of lightning. King Grieve drovehis fleet after them in a headlong charge. Groaning at the benches, the muscularNorukai pulled on the oars, driving the serpent ships faster than any wind.The small krakener and four large warships fled north with all possible speed,which told Lars that the sorceress could not sustain her attacks. She and othergifted provocateurs had struck and harassed the serpent ships at sunset, butthen they turned and fled. Obviously, they feared King Grieve’s mighty navy!Nicci’s lightning had been nothing more than a sting to enrage the wild bear ofthe Norukai fleet, and the serpent ships swooped after her, closing in for thekill.Lars commanded his crew, “Pull at the oars. You are not weaklings!” The muscularraiders, both men and women, sat at the benches and gritted their teeth,groaning with the effort. The oars dipped into the water, cut deep, and pulledback. He did not want his ships to lose their quarry in the darkness asthickening fog rose all around them.While Grieve and his fleet sailed forward like a battering ram, Lars and his tenships hugged closer to the shore. This was farther north than he had everexplored, even on their recent destructive raids. Just like his comrade Kor hadbeen, Lars was under a death sentence, obligated to fight until he died. Hewould keep attacking these scared little people for as long as he could, but hedidn’t expect they would manage to kill him anytime soon.Now his raiding ships sailed through the black night and suffocating fog, butLars could hear waves rushing against the nearby coast. “Row faster! Thesorceress is out there somewhere. We must be the first to catch her.”“Will King Grieve feed her to the serpent god?” asked one of the warriors.“There is no serpent god,” said Ura, a muscular woman who was too ugly even forLars. She’d shaved her head to make herself nearly indistinguishable from amale, although she could not hide her heavy breasts. “We are the serpent god,and we take the sacrifices ourselves.”Lars said, “First we have to catch them.”The oar master pounded on the drums, and the serpent ships plunged into theimpenetrable fog. Near the serpent figurehead, one sailor cried out in surpriseand pointed forward. “Lars, look! Some kind of beacon.”A bright light sparked upward from the veils of white mist, like a full moon. Itglowed and pulsed at the waterline, tempting, dazzling.“What could it be?” asked Ura.“It is magic,” one of the raiders muttered.“Of course it is magic—we are hunting a sorceress!” Lars said. “That is whereshe must be! Adjust course. We will follow that light and run it down.”The sailors pulled hard on the oars, and the serpent ships cut through the waterlike vipers ready to strike. The tantalizing beacon glowed through the fog,calling them. It lifted higher in the sky then dropped low again.“Prepare your weapons,” Lars said.The Norukai seized their assortment of blades and clubs and rushed to the frontof the ship, ready to swing themselves overboard as soon as they cornered theirprey. The glow brightened, and Lars had to shade his eyes. He still didn’t knowwhat it was, but the beacon seemed to be retreating. “Faster!”Just as the first serpent ships approached the dazzling orb, he heard the crashof breakers—far too close. He had only a moment to think before his ship ranaground.“Reefs!” Ura screamed just before she was hurled overboard by the impact. Jaggedrocks ripped open the lower hull, smashed the keel.Lars slammed against the rail. Many of his sailors bowled into one another andtumbled over the side, yelling in rage. Hulls cracked and crunched as more ofhis serpent ships smashed against unseen reefs. The glowing beacon hoveredmockingly overhead, brightened to a flare, then winked out, leaving them inmist-shrouded darkness.Another serpent ship careened into Lars’s vessel from the starboard side,crushing the hull, snapping off the oars like twigs. The impact shattered hisribs and his left arm, and Lars fell over the side as his ship tilted. Watergushed into the open gap in its hull.He plunged into the roiling water and flailed with his useless broken arm. Hisbare chest scraped against the sharp reef rocks. He saw dozens of his crewscrambling for purchase against the heavy waves, holding on to the wreckage.At least seven of his vessels had run up onto the reefs, and Lars realized thatthe glowing orb had lured them into treacherous waters. A trick! Hundreds ofwounded Norukai were swept out to sea or caught up in the churning foam andpulped against the rocks.The fog grew even thicker, hiding them from the rest of the receding fleet. Larscould only hear the resounding crashes as more serpent ships plowed into thereefs and other vessels. When he tried to shout, a curl of seawater gushed intohis mouth. He coughed, his shattered ribs stabbing like knives. He tried to pullhimself onto the questionable safety of the reef.Ura climbed up on the rocks that were slick with green seaweed, reaching for ahandhold. She cried out as something grabbed her. She clawed at her leg, tryingto break free, but she was jerked into the water. Nearby, Lars heard morescreams, not just anger and surprise from the wrecks. His people were beingattacked! The Norukai clawed for shelter on the reefs, but more were sweptunder, seized by something beneath the water.Lars squirmed about, looking for an enemy. “Who are you?” He had lost his swordduring the fall, and his arm was broken, but he bunched his other first. “Whereare you?”Humanlike forms glided up out of the water, sleek and gray, covered with scalesand with mouths full of needle teeth. They slithered onto the reef rocks to fallupon their helpless prey.The selka had pursued the Norukai fleet, waiting for their chance, and now theyrose from the foamy water. Three of them grabbed Lars. He struggled, but theytore him to shreds before dragging his body in pieces under the waves."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 72 [part0003.html#a7]The imperial road rolled ahead of them, mile after mile, unwinding in lazycurves along the foothills. Tens of thousands of trampling boots left a muchwider swath behind them as they crossed the land.Utros dispatched scout parties and procurement armies along offshoot tracks, butonly a few of the parties were successful in bringing back enough food for him,Ruva, and his primary commanders. Meanwhile, the main body of his army pushedonward like a slow stampede.The general shaded his eyes to look ahead down the endless road that eventuallyled to Tanimura—or so he hoped. Hovering nearby, Ava’s spirit let out a brittlelaugh. “We have only to walk forever, beloved Utros, and then we will be there!”He tried to squeeze greater speed from his stallion, but the animal wasexhausted and hungry, plodding along with no more energy than the shamblingsoldiers behind them.Utros had conquered many cities in the past, and he remembered every victory.Numerous town leaders or self-proclaimed kings had fallen under his sword. Backthen, his army was invincible, and his success was guaranteed in eachengagement. He had never imagined that Iron Fang’s entire empire would fall, butUtros still intended to complete his mission.The endless string of soldiers marched through the low hills until they formed asprawling camp that stretched throughout the woods. The soldiers didn’t botherwith cook fires, for they had nothing to eat except a few rabbits, squirrels, orother wild game they had scrounged. By now, his warriors were so ferociouslyhungry that they devoured any animals they killed without bothering to cook theraw meat, while their starving comrades licked any smears of blood left behind.As darkness fell in the sparse forest, Utros lay back on the ground and drowsedwhile listening to the rustle of the camp. He had vowed to conquer the OldWorld, and his men had followed him for so long. He would not let it all be afool’s chase.Ruva lay beside him, curling her naked body against his, but not in an eroticway. She drew strength and comfort and gave it back to him. Without speaking,she just pressed her back and shoulders against his chest. He wrapped hismuscular arm around her. “Tell me you can keep them alive, Ruva. Tell me yourspell is strong enough.”“Strong enough?” Her body shook, and he realized she was laughing. “You think Iam stronger than the Keeper?”“Keep him at bay for a little while longer. It is to his advantage to let mecontinue my war, because we will send him many more souls.” Utros felt a shiverand opened his eyes to see Ava’s glimmering form above them, as if jealous thather sister could touch his solid form and she could not.“The Keeper wants what he wants. The Keeper wants me.” Ava drifted closer,extended her flickering arms. “He wants Ruva, both of us.” Her image strainedlike a flame in a wind. When her sister reached out for her, Ava vanished. Ruvaslumped back down, sobbing, curled up in a fetal ball.When sleep still eluded Utros after an hour, he rose and walked among hissoldiers, speaking quiet encouragement to anyone who remained awake. He walkedto the perimeter of the camp, where the forest grew darker and thicker. He heardrustling in the underbrush, saw shadows of movement, and he tensed, ready tofight whatever might be out there. When he dropped a hand to his side, herealized he had left his sword back with Ruva.Tawny shapes drifted among the shadowy trees. For a moment he thought they werestags, in which case he would send out hunters to shoot them down, but whenseveral of the wild forms glided toward him, Utros saw they were not deer, butfeline, predatory.Sand panthers whispered through the woods, their large paws barely crackling theforest debris. Catching him alone, easy prey, a massive female bounded towardhim and let out a roar. The other cats streaked forward into the camp.Though unarmed, Utros swung his fists as the panther crashed into his chest andbore him down. With a grunt of effort, he heaved the big cat aside, onlyperipherally noticing that the tan hide was covered with branded runes such ashe had seen on the combat beasts from Ildakar. Claws raked across his upper arm,cutting deep into the thick muscle before his metal bracer caught the claws. Inthe brawl, he punched the snarling panther under the chin.Roused by the noise, other soldiers came running, and more big cats fell uponthem. The lead female, though, targeted Utros specifically. Something wasdriving the animal; this was not just some mindless predator making a convenientkill.As more soldiers rushed to defend the general, he heard another round of shoutedalarms in the extended camp. A clash of swords rang out into the damp night air.As he battled the sand panther, he couldn’t let his attention waver, but he sawhuman forms darting in, barely visible in the forest gloom. With a swift,dispersed strike, they attacked the groggy soldiers, killing hundreds beforethey melted back into the trees, never becoming fully visible.Utros continued to wrestle with the panther. Her claws ripped through hisleather armor and tore open his side. The cat’s eyes shone in the starlight,full of murder, and when she roared, he could feel her hot breath on his face.“Utros! No!” Running up, Ruva raised her hands and summoned her gift. A crackleof magic swept through the air, flames that licked out to slam the panther, butto the general’s astonishment, Ruva’s fire merely rippled around the spellmarkings on the tan hide, causing no harm.The bright flash of impotent fire was enough to startle the cat, though. Theanimal leaped back, snarled, then pounced on Utros again. With the sweep of apaw, she knocked off the gold mask, which clattered to the ground. Ruva struckout again with her magic, buffeting the panther, and as Utros rallied, the bigcat retreated, snarled one more time, and melted back into the trees.With their general under attack, hundreds of his soldiers grabbed their weaponsand came running to the rescue. More than a dozen sand panthers were attackinghis army in a concerted effort, but when so many soldiers rallied against them,the cats snarled, slashed a few more times, and bolted into the forest. Theyvanished into the night.Hungry for revenge, some soldiers rushed into the forest in pursuit of themysterious attackers, but their battle cries turned into screams as they diedout in the darkness.Utros stood, bleeding from where the panther had mauled him. Sobbing, Ruvapressed herself against him. “You’re hurt. You’re bleeding, so much blood!” Thenshe smiled oddly at him. “Blood . . . has magic.”The sorceress clasped the deep cut in his biceps, squeezed, and unleashed hergift. He felt a tingling warmth as his muscles and skin knitted under herhealing spell. He had rarely asked either of the twins to heal him, becausebattle injuries were worth savoring. Even the pain counted for something.But Utros could not afford to be weak. He needed the full use of his body. AsRuva patched his worst wounds, he stared into the forest where the panthers haddisappeared. What had driven them here? What guided them?Now alert and on edge, the soldiers in the camp gathered up the bodies of themen who had been slain by the panthers and the mysterious attackers in theforest. Under normal circumstances, his warriors would prepare the fallen for arespectful burial or funeral pyres, but these were not normal circumstances.Utros did not want to think about what they did with the corpses.*Sleeping on the Chaser’s deck as it raced away from Serrimundi with the Norukaifleet in hot pursuit, Nicci fell deeper into herself, and her dream presenceconnected with her sister panther.Mrra moved with twenty other sand panthers, pacing the army of General Utros.The panthers had no maps, but Nicci had a clear sense of where they were fromthe strength of her connection. The spell bond was growing stronger as they cametogether after being widely separated. Mrra continued to lope toward Nicci, dayafter day, closing the distance and trying to help.Nicci tasted blood as she dreamed. Seeing through feline eyes and feeling herclaws and muscles, she crashed out of the forest and attacked the enemysoldiers. Connected to Mrra, Nicci guided the cat to find a singular target, themost important victim in the entire army. General Utros.She and Mrra attacked the commander, wounded him, tore off his golden mask, buteven though the branded runes protected her from direct damage by magic, Ruva’spowers were dangerous. And the general and his soldiers could kill the panthers.Nicci urged them to withdraw.Licking blood from her whiskers, Mrra bounded off into the forest, and Niccismiled in her sleep.The ships sailed into the night, heading toward Tanimura with the serpent shipsbehind them. Knowing that Mrra was on her way with a new pride of sand panthersbrought joy to Nicci’s heart.But now she also knew that General Utros and his army were marching closer andcloser."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 73 [part0003.html#a7]While waiting for Nicci to return with her reconnaissance of the Norukai fleet,Tanimura prepared for war. General Zimmer knew that the fate of the D’HaranEmpire rested on whether or not the forces under his command could stand againstthe crushing blow coming their way. They had to be ready.Arriving at Tanimura aboard Captain Mills’s ship, which had sailed directly upfrom Serrimundi, he felt great satisfaction to see fifty significant shipsprotecting the harbor and patrolling the waters. They ranged in size fromfishing boats to three-masted vessels capable of long sea voyages. Nicci’searlier warning had sunk in. This city could mount formidable defenses, andZimmer was glad to see it.After disembarking from the cargo ship that had been anchored for months as aguardian of Renda Bay, he marched through the city with the remnants of hisexpeditionary force. Insisting on discipline, Zimmer forced his returningsoldiers to walk in steady ranks to demonstrate they had not forgotten theyserved in the D’Haran army. After all the hardships they had suffered sinceleaving Tanimura, their uniforms were tattered and their boots were worn andcracked. Their skin was weathered, their muscles toughened through hardship. Hesaid, “We must try to look as impressive on our return as when we departed.” Thetroops moved at a brisk pace up the city streets back to the garrison, glad tobe home.At the garrison, recruits were drilling in the town square, and they turned tolook at the returning troops in surprise. Zimmer strode into the courtyard withsquared shoulders and entered the main headquarters building.When he reunited with General Linden, the other man rose from behind his desk togreet him, dismayed by the weathered condition of Zimmer’s armor, the tatteredcape of rank, the hardened look in his eyes. “You look as if you fought a warjust this morning!”“I’ve fought several wars, Linden, and saved the biggest one for last. Thebattle is coming here, sooner than you might expect.”Linden called for a hearty meal, the best food Zimmer had tasted in some time.While the weary general ate, Linden opened a ledger and dipped a quill in aninkpot so he could scribble notes as his companion described their adventuresand the threat of the Norukai fleet as well as the army of General Utros.“I am happy to report that we’re aware of it. Nicci warned us, and we have beenmaking constant preparations.” Linden closed his ledger, then rattled off hisown summary. “Lord Rahl understands our need, but he is occupied with anothercrisis in D’Hara. This war is ours to handle, and he has complete faith in us.He sent Nicci a powerful constructed spell, which he says is all she needs.”Zimmer nodded. “I have seen what Nicci can do.” He tore another hunk of meatfrom the roast chicken on the platter in front of him. “But I have also seen theNorukai raiders, as well as the ancient army. Utros and his soldiers marchedacross an entire continent and they mean to conquer Tanimura. From there, theywill move on to the New World. Unless we stop them.”Linden set his jaw. “And we will form defenses they have never seen either.Tanimura is strong.”Zimmer finished the entire chicken, ate a cluster of sweet grapes, and drank agoblet of water. “That’s what I am here to help you with.”For the next several days he and his weary but energized troops whipped theTanimura militia into shape. Zimmer wore fresh D’Haran armor, feelingresplendent as a general again. He inspected the city armories, watched thefrantic work of swordsmiths, tanners, armorers, shield makers. Even thoughblacksmiths had worked all day and night, many new recruits did not have bladesof their own, so they made do with clubs, axes, long-handled mallets. Crudeweapons required less finesse and training to use, only anger and strength, andthe fighters had plenty of that.Tanimura was already a populous city, one of the main trading centers on thecontinent. The many citizens, as well as countless new refugees, were preparedto defend their homes. Fletchers produced arrows by the thousands, and archerspracticed for hour after hour. Workers squatted on barrels and covered the arrowtips with pitch, rolling balls that could be lit on fire for an even more deadlybarrage.Captains Mills and Donell had delivered the displaced population of Renda Bay,and those thousands of angry people expanded the fighting force. Many familiesoffered to share spare rooms so that the new refugees had places to stay andfood to eat.Zimmer rode down the streets, rallying everyone. In the practice yards he sawtownspeople fitted with leather vests and helmets. They sparred with oneanother, flinging sweat out of their hair as they learned the basics ofswordplay.Attached to the lower part of the harbor, Halsband Island—where the Palace ofthe Prophets had once stood—was just a flat area of crushed rubble, perfect foruse as a training field. Militia members marched back and forth, learning how tofall into ranks and clashing in mock battles.As he walked the streets to the waterfront, Zimmer came upon Oron and Perri.Lord Oron’s expression was dour as usual. He had rebraided his pale hair andrestored his haughty expression. Perri followed him, younger and meeker, but hereyes also had a hardness after what she’d been through. Together they looked outat the multiple ships gathered to defend the waters around Tanimura. Every shipcarried spears, bows, and fire arrows to be used for naval battles.“We might just be able to hold off the Norukai fleet,” Zimmer said. “Tanimurahas never seen such a powerful navy.”Oron ran a finger along his lower lip. “Ildakar taught us many ways to fight,but this city also has plenty of gifted, including the Sisters of the Light.Many of us will man the ships in the harbor to face the Norukai fleet, butothers will remain in the city to assist your large army. You have thousands ofdefenders ready to fight against a land invasion.” He gazed at the hills behindTanimura. “There’s no telling when General Utros will arrive.”“We’ll be ready for him,” Perri said. “And the Norukai.”Zimmer mentally reviewed the other times he had faced impossible odds. Hehimself had led guerrilla teams to harass Old World towns that supported theImperial Order. Back then, he had been forced to accept the new dictum thatthere were no innocents in that war, that even women and children who aidedenemy soldiers were enemies in their own way. Zimmer had not been proud of thatwork, but Lord Rahl’s forces had won.Across the harbor, smoke signals rose into the sky, and a succession of brightlycolored pennants waved to signal the arrival of ships. The Chaser, the MistMaiden, and two other large sailing ships had just arrived from Serrimundi,putting the rest of the harbor on high alert.When the swift krakener pulled ahead of the larger ships and reached the mainpiers first, Zimmer, Oron, and Perri hurried to meet them. Nicci and Nathan werethe first to disembark, both of them looking exhausted from a great expenditureof their gift.“We pressed these ships as fast as we could,” Nathan said.Nicci added, “The Norukai fleet is on its way, right behind us.”“Has Serrimundi been attacked?” Zimmer asked. “What happened?”Oron interrupted, “How much damage did Lady Olgya cause? I hope she wreckeddozens of serpent ships.”“If our plan worked, then Serrimundi is safe. Olgya disguised the harbor with agreat fog bank at night, while we lured the ships onward. They pursued usthrough the darkness.” Nicci looked around impatiently. “King Grieve’s shipswill arrive in less than a day. All of Tanimura must be ready to battle them.”Zimmer clenched his fists. “We’ll be on high alert. As you can see, we haveprepared significant defenses.”“Tanimura is our best hope of stopping them,” Nathan said.Bannon and Lila joined them. “We have a score to settle with the Norukai. I’mready to fight them again, any time.”“It’s more than just the Norukai,” Nicci said. “Last night, I dreamed through mysand panther’s eyes. The army of General Utros is closing in, and then we willbe fighting on two fronts.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 74 [part0003.html#a7]The Chaser sailed out to the edge of the harbor in the morning sunlight.Standing on the deck of the krakener, Bannon wrapped his palm around the hilt ofNathan’s sword, his sword, and kept watch for the Norukai serpent ships, surethat soon enough they would see countless dark blue sails. Nathan had decided tostay with him and Lila aboard the Chaser, where they could face the first clashwith the vile raiders. Captain Jared’s vessel was a scrappy little warshipprepared for battle.Bannon’s long ginger hair was loose, just like Nathan’s. Lila looked at themboth. “You should cut your hair so no enemy can grab it.”“I am rather fond of my hair,” Nathan said. “It makes me look dashing. Onecannot sacrifice everything.”Lila sniffed, but didn’t argue with him. Wearing only her morazeth leather, sheplanted her feet on the deck and stood ready. The studded soles of her highbattle sandals would give her good traction even if the deck were tilted orcovered with spilled blood.Bannon looked across the sparkling waves, then turned to the wizard. “Thank youagain for giving me the sword. I never wanted a better blade than Sturdy, but Iwill make you proud with this one.” He slid the weapon from its scabbard, andsunshine gleamed on the smooth steel.“Use it well, my boy, and that will be thanks enough.”Bannon turned back toward the city. “I bought Sturdy here in Tanimura afterthose thugs nearly killed me. I’m not so destitute anymore. I can’t believeNicci rescued me instead of just leaving me to my fate. It was my ownfoolishness!”Nathan mused, “The sorceress likes others to think she has an icy heart, butRichard taught her to help those in need. She can see the value of aninvestment. She made the effort to save you, and how many enemies have you slainto repay her for that one kindness?”“Not enough,” Lila said. “But we will make up for it as soon as King Grievearrives.”Pounding drums and ringing bells set up a racket across the ships. Farther outto sea, patrol boats lit their smoky signals.“Norukai are coming!” shouted Captain Jared. His grin showed the gap between hisfront teeth. “Set the sails! What are we waiting for?”Bannon braced himself, and Lila stood beside him, wearing a satisfied smile.“Maybe the stink of this ship will kill the first line of attackers,” she said.Jared brushed aside the teasing insult and stared ahead at the oncoming ships.*King Grieve stood behind the carved serpent figurehead and stared at the greatcity as it came into view. He let out a hissing roar when he saw the countlessarmored ships arrayed in a defensive line, blocking the harbor.But they couldn’t stop him. Grieve was the serpent god. Every fighter in hisfleet also carried the blood of the serpent god. His warriors had the energy andsoul of their deity surging through their veins.In the previous day, as they sailed with all possible speed toward Tanimura inpursuit of their prey, his warriors had seen a great omen that added fire totheir veins. One of the lookouts had shouted, pointing off to the horizon whereanother huge snakelike form curled in the waves. Grieve had felt his heart swellto see another manifestation of the serpent god, and he let out a bellow thatechoed across the choppy sea. The other Norukai joined in a resounding roar asthe new serpent god swam off.Grieve and his people would engage in this battle themselves, but they allcarried its presence inside them. Their victory was now assured.Grieve didn’t know where General Utros’s army was, nor did he care. Though theywere supposedly allies, the pompous commander was worthless, and the Norukaiwould do what they already did so well. His raiders would smash Tanimura andclaim all the surrounding lands by the time Utros and his exhausted army marchedup the imperial road. By then, the Norukai might be ready for another fight andwipe them out.The raider ships cut through the water like sea serpents. Warriors strained atthe oars, pulling in perfect unison. The oar masters pounded their drums as hardand fast as the heartbeat of an angry fighter. Grieve’s fleet raced headlongtoward the Tanimuran ships lined up to block him. They would all sink. He wouldsmash them. Burn them.Atta strode up behind him. “I fight at your side, Grieve. They will all grieve,while we laugh and feast. Afterward, we will make love like two animals inheat.”Grieve let out a low rumble in his chest. Atta was a vigorous and exhaustinglover, just what he needed to burn off the bloodlust from a good battle. Rightnow, he had to concentrate on killing instead of lust.A sullen mood crossed him. He missed Chalk’s amusing antics and his chatter. Theshaman could have foretold how this battle would end. Then again, Grieve oftencould not understand the albino’s confusing pronouncements. “The axe cleaves thewood, the sword cleaves the bone.”As she looked toward the defensive ships braced outside of Tanimura, Attasnorted, “It is a trap. They lured us here.”“We see their trap, but we will not be deterred.” Grieve’s raiders would careenlike a battering ram into those warships. “The sharks will feed well tonight.”“We all will,” Atta replied. Other crew members added their cheers.As the ships approached, Grieve recognized a small gray vessel pulling ahead ofthe other Tanimuran ships. The krakener. “There, that ship! We will destroyevery vessel that stands against us, but first . . .” He ground his teethtogether, rippling his scarred jaws. “That ship is first. That ship is mine.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 75 [part0003.html#a7]The widely dispersed Tanimuran navy was a motley collection of large and smallships, some heavily armored and riding low in the water, others more nimble.Hardened fishermen and veteran traders knew how to combat storms and big fish onthe high seas, but they had never battled anything like the Norukai.More than a hundred serpent ships sailed toward them. Nathan stood at the bow ofthe Chaser, feeling his pulse race. He found that he quite looked forward to theencounter.The foremost Norukai ship pressed directly toward the krakener, oars churningthe water. “Sweet Sea Mother, here they come!” Bannon said.Across the defensive line, the fighters prepared for the clash, soldiers,sailors, and archers. There were also gifted men and women, including Oron,Perri, several Sisters of the Light, trained scholars from Cliffwall, and othergifted Tanimura residents who offered their abilities.Captain Jared grew more serious than Nathan had seen him before. “I didn’t knowthe Norukai had so many ships!”Impressed, Nathan smiled. “King Grieve likes to prey upon helpless villages.Today, he will learn we are different.”Nicci had stayed on land along with Zimmer and Linden, joining the D’Harantroops that patrolled the waterfront. They were ready to fight in the streets ifthe Norukai broke through the naval blockade and tried to pillage the city.Nathan knew the sorceress could stop them, but he didn’t intend to let any ofthe serpent ships break through.As the attackers approached, the scarred warriors crowded the decks, raisingswords and axes. Clutching the serpent figurehead, King Grieve thundered out hisprimal challenge.Bannon roared back at the top of his lungs, “We will kill you, Grieve! Come andget us, you ugly bastard!”Looking at him, Lila cocked an eyebrow. “Impressive, boy.”Nathan directed his sharp focus toward the Norukai king, who was the mosthideous of them all. A repulsive blocky woman beside him pumped a fist into theair with a meaty arm.Nathan felt the dangerous magic build inside him. “Come and meet your fate.”He had first seen the Norukai after he, Nicci, and Bannon had been shipwreckednear Renda Bay. During the attack on that town, the Norukai had mowed down somany helpless people. . . .As if Bannon was recalling that same night, his expression hardened. He held hissword in a death grip, and sweat prickled his forehead. “There’ll be a big fightahead. I may go into my blood rage and I won’t know what’s happening.” He lookedat Lila. “So many of them to kill.”The pounding of Norukai drums echoed across the harbor, and the shouts ofchallenge grew louder. Inside his chest, Nathan felt his heart twist with anger,not entirely caused by the lingering shadow of Chief Handler Ivan. He whisperedto the dark presence inside him, “You will soon have as much violence as youdesire. Make yourself useful.”The serpent ships came closer and closer. The raiders pulled on their oars in afinal charge.At the Chaser’s bow, Nathan raised his hands, spread his fingers. “It’s abouttime.” As a crackle of magic infused the air, the breezes picked up, and hiscape snapped about like a flag in the wind. On other nearby ships he saw Sistersof the Light standing at the bow, and they all summoned their magic as well.All along the defensive line, the gifted fighters stirred the water, tugged onthe waves, stretched the sea. Froth swirled in front of the Chaser, and Nathandrew upon his gift to fashion new waves like a baker stretching dough. Exhalingwith the effort, he pushed his hands down, using the unseen force to create atrough in the water. The blow sent successive ripples, each one building uponthe last, and waves began to coalesce into whitecaps that rolled toward theNorukai fleet.Nathan shoved more power into the water, churning bigger waves and pushing astorm into the sea. His fellow gifted fighters on other ships used similar magicto form waves and unleash surging currents into the normally placid harbor. Asthe enemy fleet advanced, high waves rocked the vessels from side to side likeflotsam in a squall, throwing several Norukai overboard. One man slipped downinto the sweeping oars, which battered him under the water.Nathan saw Oron aboard Captain Straker’s ship, slashing his fists sideways towhip up towering waves, which capsized a serpent vessel. Seawater sloshed overthe deck and swept away a dozen angry raiders.Nathan resonated his waves with Oron’s, which built them to twice the force.Hammer-walls of water crashed the Norukai ships together like toys, breakingopen hulls and snapping masts.But the raiders kept coming. King Grieve demanded more speed from his crew, andthey pulled relentlessly on the oars. From the prow of each Norukai vessel, acarved serpent stared with jaws wide, ready to ram.Nathan pushed a wave against one of the flanking serpent ships, raised it high,then instantly withdrew the water so that it plummeted back down and splinteredin the sea. Waves threw two raider ships against each other, shattering bothlike eggs.Dozens more plowed through the wreckage of their own ships. The Sisters of theLight worked together to raise a concerted shield of water that doused moreNorukai ships and pushed several vessels back, but the raiders only rowedharder.The Chaser’s crew held on for dear life in the backwash of the waves. Bannonstabilized himself against the rail, while Lila planted her feet and kept herbalance, glaring murder at the oncoming attackers.King Grieve somehow managed to keep his rowers pushing the lead ship forward.With surprising speed, his vessel plowed toward the krakener. Even with half ofits oars snapped, the king’s flagship came forward like a snarling beast. Nathantried to slam it with a wave, but the enemy ship kept coming.Beside Grieve at the bow of the vessel, the ugly Norukai woman waved a sword ofher own. The king raised his war axe.Nathan called wind to try to drive away the oncoming ship, but the flagshipcrashed ahead in a suicidal push. He shoved his wall of air with such force thathe cracked the mainmast, but the enemy vessel could not be stopped. The shiprammed the krakener with an impact like a thunderclap that shuddered through thehull and deck. As it slammed into them, the serpent figurehead shattered intopieces. Boards shivered and cracked.Bannon was flung down the deck as the Chaser tilted, and Lila snatched his shirtto keep him from falling.But Nathan had been concentrating on his gift, shaping the wind and moving thewaves. He could not catch himself fast enough and lost his footing. Thrown offbalance, he tumbled into the rail, tried to grab it, but slipped. He felloverboard and into the churning water filled with broken wood and bleedingbodies."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 76 [part0003.html#a7]Although the initial clash took place out on the water, Nicci and the ranks ofD’Haran soldiers took their positions along the docks, ready to drive back anyraiders that managed to break through the line of ships. With Grieve’s recklessnavy, at least some of the vessels might make it to the city and wreak havoc.Many Sisters of the Light were out in the harbor, but Nicci remained on shorewith Sisters Eldine, Rhoda, Mab, and Arabella. She was armed with her twodaggers, as well as her gift. She still carried the small bone box Richard hadgiven her, even if she had not yet deciphered its purpose. Richard knew therewas something special about Nicci’s background, her knowledge, her gift. In themeantime, she had plenty of other ways to fight a war.Linden had dispatched scouts to ride into the hills above Tanimura, looking forany sign of General Utros’s army, but the scouts had not yet returned.Meanwhile, the Norukai were attacking now. The soldiers lined up, ready toprotect the city.In front of a group of waterfront warehouses, General Zimmer sat high on hiswarhorse, surveying the tremendous naval battle under way out on the water. Hismount snorted and shifted from side to side, sensing the violence in the air.Along the extended wharves, all the piers were empty, every ship dispatched tofight the Norukai. His men moved restlessly in ranks, hands on the hilts oftheir swords, anxious to cut down any raiders that made it to shore.The serpent ships plowed into the Tanimuran blockade. The gifted fighterssummoned great waves to disrupt the Norukai advance, and even from the docksNicci could hear the distant clamor of raider ships smashing into one another.Thunderclouds gathered as the wizards lashed out with storms.At the forefront, King Grieve’s ship rammed into the Chaser, causing tremendousdamage. Nicci watched two Norukai vessels flank Captain Mills’s ship and throwgrappling hooks so the raiders could swarm aboard. Though many serpent shipscrashed into one another, hammered by waves and driven back by the gifteddefenders, others succeeded in breaking through the blockade and pushed directlytoward the city. Dozens of enemy vessels had already sunk, and yet they keptcoming.Angry, Nicci longed to be on the front lines using her gift to destroy theNorukai. She did not like to feel safe while others were dying, but she wouldnot leave Tanimura so vulnerable. “We will have our time soon enough,” shemuttered under her breath.Waiting on dry land, the soldiers sent up a cheer, hurling angry insults outtoward the enemy. General Zimmer shook his head in disbelief. “The Norukai areinsane. Look at them! They do not value their own lives. They sacrifice five orten for every one that gets through.”The Norukai plowed forward despite the storm winds and crashing waves. Thirtyraider ships penetrated the blockade, leaving many more behind as they chargedstraight toward the docks.Nicci turned to the Sisters. “Nathan and the others will do their best on thewater. Now it is our turn to mop up the rest.”“I’m glad to fight beside you again, Sister Nicci,” said Eldine. “It is goodthat you came back to the Sisters of the Light.”Nicci’s eyes hardened. “I did not come back. I’m not a Sister of the Dark, noram I a member of your order. I serve Lord Rahl, and I serve myself.” She flasheda glance at the gathered women. “But we are Sisters in our own way, against acommon enemy.”As the handful of serpent ships careened toward the docks, Zimmer dispatchedarmed companies up and down the waterfront to meet them. Their boots created astaccato thunder as they ran along. Vengeful refugees from Renda Bay and Effrenjoined the D’Haran army to help fight, but the professional soldiers would bearthe brunt of the first onslaught. Zimmer spurred his horse, and the soldiersyelled as they charged.Several raider vessels also approached the shores of flattened Halsband Islandand the new connecting bridges to the main city. Sister Rhoda looked at wherethe Palace of the Prophets had once towered above the city and flashed a hungrysmile. “Maybe Halsband Island will grow green again if we drench it with enoughNorukai blood.”Nicci smiled. “I like that kind of thinking, but these nearer ships will cause aproblem first.”A trio of battered raiders headed for a patch of open shore at the far end ofthe main piers. One hull bore burn scars from where lightning had scorched thewood. The dark sails showed gaping holes, but a few intact oars pushed the shipsalong on a drunkard’s path until they ran aground on the stony shingle. Scarredraiders boiled off the decks and dropped onto land.Two more serpent ships slammed into one of the empty docks, grinding against thepilings. Muscular slavers leaped over the rail and bounded toward the city,weapons drawn and ready for mayhem.Nicci and the D’Haran soldiers were there to stop them. The Sisters of the Lightlashed out with icy rain and sharp projectiles of hail, but the Norukai huncheddown and charged ahead with their axes, spiked maces, chained balls. Openingtheir scarred mouths, they howled.One of the new D’Haran soldiers was terrified. “They’re monsters.”Nicci said, “They bleed like humans and they die like humans.”To demonstrate what she meant, she summoned wizard’s fire in her palm. Asraiders stormed toward her, their screams changed when Nicci’s flaming ballexploded in the first man’s chest and spurted out his back. The unstoppable fireroasted three other Norukai close behind him.She summoned a second sphere and hurled it higher, so that the fireball droppeddown into the ranks behind. Though many died screaming, the Norukai did not halttheir charge for an instant. Even as their comrades fell dead, waves of raidersstomped over the charred bodies and kept running.“Shields!” Zimmer shouted, and his soldiers held their shields edge-to-edge toform a solid barrier. They advanced slowly, swords extended to meet the enemywith a resounding slam of leather, wood, and metal.Nicci lobbed another fireball high over their heads, and it exploded on thenearest serpent ship, igniting the deck and mast and killing the last fewNorukai trying to disembark.The disciplined D’Haran soldiers held a firm line, but the Norukai were in amindless battle rage. Many angry refugees broke ranks and ran into the fray,throwing themselves upon the wild raiders who had destroyed their homes andkilled their loved ones. Town leader Thaddeus leaped in, swinging a boat hook.He bashed skulls and stabbed faces with the pointed spar. Renda Bay survivorsfollowed his example with enough fury to stall the initial Norukai charge.Zimmer’s men regrouped and moved forward.From the roofs of waterfront warehouses, D’Haran archers fired volley aftervolley into the swarm of raiders. Soon the streets were piled high with Norukaibodies, and blood ran through the gutters. But the raiders kept coming.Ten more serpent ships crashed against the empty piers and disgorged a thousandyelling warriors. Heedless of their own safety, raiders rammed into the lines ofD’Haran defenders, plowing past the shields and running to the warehouses, whichthey set on fire. As flames caught on the wooden walls, bales of fabric, andstored sacks of grain, thick smoke curled upward. The archers on the rooftopshad to leap for their lives.With twin bolts of lightning, Nicci blasted several attackers into red mist andblackened meat. Every Norukai that ran onto shore seemed to expect death, andthey meant to cause as much destruction as they could before they died.One warrior with a face like a misshapen potato stalked toward General Zimmer,who was engaged in mortal combat with another opponent. Seeing that he neededhelp, Nicci extended her gift, found the ugly raider’s heart, and made itexplode. The Norukai man dropped like a felled ox. Four of his comrades lookedat him, unable to understand what had happened. Nicci released her gift againand stopped their hearts as well.Out in the water, the naval battle continued. At least forty serpent ships hadalready been wrecked or sunk.As Nicci worked to create more wizard’s fire, a Norukai woman swung a spikedclub at her head. Nicci ducked and plunged her dagger into the woman’s heart.Even with the blade stuck in her chest, the woman still pressed the weight ofher heavy body against Nicci. While Nicci was distracted, the wizard’s fireflickered in her hand, but she slapped the remnants into the woman’s face, andher head burst into flame. Nicci shoved the weight aside and turned to face hernext victim.Then, in the heat of the battle, the sound of the clamor changed. Nicci heardloud shouts from the outskirts of the city, a banging of drums, a howl of alarm.Scouts galloped along the hill roads and raced into Tanimura, shouting in panic.Though their voices were diminished by the distance and the chaos of the battleat the waterfront, Nicci recognized the scouts. Ice formed in her gut as she sawa long line of soldiers coming behind them at a fast march. They wore armor andcarried standards that she had seen before, the mark of an emperor who had diedfifteen centuries earlier.Nearly a hundred thousand strong, the army of General Utros rolled over thehills toward Tanimura."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 77 [part0003.html#a7]When King Grieve’s ship collided with the Chaser, the impact threw Bannonagainst a crate on the deck so hard his head rang. He smashed his elbow, butmanaged to keep his grip on the ornate sword.But he couldn’t react in time to save Nathan from being thrown overboard.“No!” Bannon lunged, but the deck boards were slippery with spray and coveredwith a hard varnish of kraken slime. He sprawled on his back and rolled. Lilaseized his wrist before he, too, fell overboard.“The wizard can take care of himself.” Lila pushed his shoulder, turning him.“No time. Look!”Bannon reeled backward as dozens of barbaric raiders leaped across the gap. TheNorukai were a storm of bladed weapons, bulging muscles, and scarred faces.Their battle cries made them sound like hungry beasts.“Hold together!” Jared yelled. With a hard, out-of-place laugh, the krakenercaptain wielded a long-handled hatchet designed for lopping off tentacles. Witha sideways sweep, he caught one of the overconfident Norukai by surprise,proving that the hatchet could slice off a human head as easily as it severedkraken appendages.Bannon braced himself with his sword, while Lila stood at his side with hersword in one hand, a dagger in the other. Her hungry grin looked moreintimidating than any of the Norukai did.King Grieve crashed onto the deck of the Chaser. His heavy boots thudded on theboards, and he swept his war axe back and forth with one hand as if it were atoy. Recognizing Bannon, he laughed aloud. His snort sounded like a loud belch.“Walking meat.” He strode forward. “Dead meat.” The blade of the war axe was asbroad as the king’s head. The sharpened crescent edge gleamed like a silversmile.The ugly and uncouth Atta thumped beside Grieve, and Lila hissed at her ownnemesis.The Chaser’s crew ran forward armed with boat hooks and clubs. They were strongfrom hard work and brave from wrestling kraken. The ten D’Haran soldiers aboardthe ship also threw themselves into the fray.Ignoring the other raiders on the deck, Bannon stepped up to face King Grievewith his fancy sword raised. “Of all these enemies, you’re the one I want tokill the most.”Grieve charged like an Ildakaran bull, and the studs of his boots dug into thelayers of hardened slime. He swung his axe with both hands, putting all of hiseffort into the blow.The weapon would have shattered Bannon’s chest, but he twisted his body out ofthe way, calling upon instinctive training. He dodged the axe and twirled like adancer, dropped, bent, and came up again. Keeping his sword low, he struck hardand sideways.Grieve turned his thick torso so that the sharp steel clanged against the ironlinks of the chain around his waist, striking sparks rather than drawing blood.Attacking him from the opposite side, Lila sprang upon the king with her daggerand short sword, slashing with a blur of sharp edges. “We’ll both kill him,boy.”Then, like an avalanche, Atta slammed into her with crippling force, knockingher away from Grieve. Lila rolled on the deck and turned on her new foe,shifting focus without the slightest hesitation. While sprawled and scramblingto her feet, Lila swung at Atta’s lower legs and stabbed her dagger point deepinto the woman’s meaty calf. Bellowing in pain, Atta smashed a hard fist down onLila’s head, but Lila sprang to her feet and crouched, coiled to fight.Grieve swung his war axe again with enough force to chop down a mast, and Bannonbarely avoided evisceration. “Chalk talked with you. You twisted him. Youtricked him. My Chalk!” He swung the axe again. This time Bannon met the blowwith the sword. The steel was strong, but the vibration of impact shuddered allthe way to the young man’s shoulder.“Chalk was mad,” Bannon taunted. “You should have let the razorfish eat him downto his bones the first time.”As expected, the comment sent the king into a blind rage. Bursting with sorrowand hungry for revenge, Grieve snapped his mouth open so that his face lookedlike a yawning, wet hole. “You will die for that!”As he fought, Bannon felt a red haze rising around his vision. “A lot of peopletried to kill me, and I am still here.” He became stronger, faster, everymovement fueled by instinct and adrenaline. The deafening sounds of hand-to-handcombat all around him became more distinct.Bannon hacked with the sword and carved a bright red furrow across Grieve’schest. The king didn’t seem to realize he had been cut. He twirled thebattle-axe and chopped down again, driving Bannon backward. The young manparried with the sword, slashed low, and nicked Grieve’s thigh, but the kingcontinued pressing.In the harbor around them, the gifted defenders maintained the turbulence,swamping or crushing serpent ships, slamming wooden hulls against one another.Even with the blockade, dozens of the serpent ships had broken through andheaded for the inner harbor, where they smashed into the docks and disgorgedwild Norukai. They swarmed into the city, which had already started to burn.Bannon couldn’t help them, though. He had enough trouble just trying to survivehere. He would have to leave the rest of Tanimura to Nicci, Zimmer, and theothers.As if trying to cut down an oak with a single blow, Grieve swung his huge axeagain. Bannon lurched to the side and collided with Atta just as she broughtdown her curved sword at Lila. If he hadn’t dislodged her, she would havesevered Lila’s arm. With a snarl, the Norukai woman spun to lash out at him, butBannon blocked her blade with his own and turned back just as King Grievefollowed through with his axe.Using the moment of distraction, Lila threw herself upon Atta, hacking deep intothe woman’s right arm. The Norukai clacked her teeth together as blood spoutedfrom mangled muscle, but she effortlessly switched her blade to the other handand attacked Lila again. The air around them was filled with a mist of blood.Grieve struck at Bannon again and again, each blow powerful enough to cleave aman in two. The young man dodged and recovered his balance. He was not afraid ofKing Grieve, and he did not want to back away. He wanted to kill the awful man.He met each blow with Nathan’s fine sword, striking back as hard as he could.By now, though, his muscles ached from the effort, and his bones rattled fromthe abuse. As the red haze crowded in and tunneled his vision, he breathedharder; his pulse accelerated, his muscles tightened. His throat went dry. Everyfiber of muscle, every drop of blood, every bead of sweat, every strand of hislong hair became consumed with defeating the Norukai king.Bannon never knew what caused his blood rage. Maybe it was some angry flaw hehad inherited from his brutal father. When the mindless fury consumed him, hebecame a killing machine with no thought or awareness other than his opponent.He couldn’t remember every blow or even every victim.As he hacked at King Grieve and his vision blurred into that fugue of murderousenergy, Bannon fought to hold on to himself and push back the haze. He wanted toremember this! He slashed hard and up, barely missing Grieve’s throat.“Sweet Sea Mother!” Bannon said, grinding his teeth. “I’ll slay you, and I willremember every instant of this fight.”The king flung his shoulders back to avoid the sword tip, then lunged towardBannon. Grieve’s face turned ruddy. “You cannot kill me. I am the serpent god!”Bannon made a scoffing noise. “I’ve already seen the serpent god killed.”With a shout as loud and as violent as the king’s, he collided with Grieve,swung, chopped, stabbed. The king defended himself, using the metal cuff aroundhis wrist to deflect a blow, turning to let his sharkskin vest catch theglancing blade.Bannon did not relent. He thrust and swung and hacked at the big man’s shoulder,chopping loose an implanted bone spike. Grieve yowled as blood sprayed from thegouge, but the pain triggered additional energy. “I am King Grieve. I am theserpent god!” Bannon dodged another vicious sweep of the war axe. “You’ll allgrieve!”The explosive strength of his attack was unstoppable. The king drove Bannonbackward, pressing him against a crate near the rail. Grieve raised his war axeover his head and brought it down with enough strength to split his victim fromhead to waist. Bannon evaded death by a hairsbreadth, and the axe embeddeditself deep into the wood. The blade wedged into the rail and stuck in the thicklayers of adhesive slime. King Grieve grasped the handle, tugged, twisted, triedto break the axe loose.As King Grieve struggled to wrench his weapon free, Bannon seized the instant.Putting all the strength of his back and shoulders and arms behind his swordstrike, he chopped down on King Grieve’s neck.The sharp blade cut all the way through the king’s spine. Grieve’s head rolledoff, held by just a scrap of skin. His jaw yawned open and his tongue dangledout as blood spouted. Stretched by the weight, the thin ribbon of tissuesnapped, and Grieve’s head dropped over the side of the ship and into thechurning water.Bannon collapsed to his knees and felt a sudden indrawn breath of silence. Heseemed to hear Chalk’s voice, the shaman calling out gibberish again and again.And now Bannon understood.The axe cleaves the wood. The sword cleaves the bone.A scream loud enough to shatter glass rolled out behind him. Atta looked as ifher heart had just been torn beating from her chest. “My Grieve!” She thunderedtoward him with all the fury of a combat bear.Grieve’s headless body collapsed to the deck. Some of the krakener crew cheered,then threw themselves on the other Norukai with redoubled force.Atta came at Bannon like a rabid dog, and he raised his sword to block her.Everything seemed to move slowly, and his weary muscles were cold sludge. WhenAtta was one step from him, her sword raised for the killing blow, Lila appearedbehind her and thrust her blade directly through the other woman’s back. Sheshoved hard with both hands, pushing the blade through Atta’s heart, and thepoint sprang out like a sharpened sapling between her breasts.Dying, Atta flailed her arms, then let her curved sword fall with a clatter tothe deck. She pawed at the steel point that had sprouted from her chest, slicingher palms. Though Atta was much heftier than her slender opponent, Lila held thebig woman up with the sword. Dark blood flowed in puddles.Finally, Atta slid down along the cutting blade, and Lila let the body fall ontothe deck."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 78 [part0003.html#a7]A ripple of dismay passed through Zimmer’s standing army as they wheeled aboutto face the horde of ancient soldiers that appeared on the outskirts of thecity. Battle horns sounded, and a roar of voices rose like a thunderclap fromUtros and his warriors.Zimmer rallied his fighters, “We are the D’Haran army! We stand against allenemies!”“We are more than that,” Nicci said. “We also have thousands of refugees armedand hungry for vengeance. Now they have their chance.”Meanwhile, the Norukai raiders fought their way deeper into the streets ofTanimura, yowling like crazed beasts. They let out a resounding cheer uponseeing their allies arrive, which virtually assured their victory. They burnedand ransacked whatever they touched. The two enemy armies closed in on the citylike flames fanned by a stiff breeze.Nearby, a Norukai warrior tilted his head back and laughed at the sky, twirlinga club in his hand. Annoyed, Nicci burned him to ash with wizard’s fire, and hisclub clattered to the ground, still clutched by smoking fingers.Spurring his warhorse, Zimmer led a charge through the chaotic Norukai, tryingto get closer to Nicci. She shoved with a wall of hardened air to clear the wayfor him. Sweat dripped down the general’s face, and his right cheek wassplattered with blood. He glanced at Utros’s enormous army outside the city, hisexpression grim. “Now I see the wisdom in your insistence on keeping so manytroops on land. I don’t know if our entire army will be enough to stop GeneralUtros from conquering the city.”Out on the water, the Tanimuran navy had smashed and sunk many serpent ships,but along the waterfront dozens of Norukai vessels had plowed into the piers anddisgorged more and more bloodthirsty barbarians. Meanwhile, Utros directed tensof thousands of ancient soldiers toward Tanimura from the opposite side, brokeninto several enormous divisions to engulf the city. Countless defenders andinnocent citizens would be slaughtered in the coming hours.Nicci didn’t underestimate the mayhem the Norukai would cause, but Utros was aconqueror. She feared him more. “I need to mount a strong defense against theancient marching army. I leave you to stop these raiders, General. Are youcapable?”He let out a loud chuckle. “Am I capable? Lord Rahl would be ashamed of me ifone of his generals couldn’t stop a crowd of ugly raiders. We will show them howwe fight for D’Hara. Take the militia members with you and stop Utros.”At Zimmer’s signal, one of his adjutants blew a war horn to signal the vengefulmilitia members, most of whom had only a few days of training. With her gift,Nicci amplified her voice to reach all the way to the rear ranks of people fromRenda Bay, from Effren, from Larrikan Shores, from other destroyed towns. “Tothe hills! We have to cut off General Utros and his army.”Yet another serpent ship slammed into the piers, and Zimmer rallied his soldiersfor a forward charge. Hundreds of blades flashed as the D’Haran army ran to meetthe Norukai. He called over his shoulder, “Go, Sorceress!”Thaddeus raised his borrowed sword and called on his people from Renda Bay,while the freed slave Rendell adjusted a leather helmet that sat askew on hishead and shouted to his own squad. A hundred armed refugees under his commandran along with him.Utros’s army carried tattered pennants with Kurgan’s ancient flame emblem, aswell as new flags with an even larger symbolic fire. At the forefront of theenemy ranks Nicci could identify the general by his distinctive horned helmetand a glint of gold from his mask. He seemed to regard the city below as if itwere a fat calf to be slaughtered. His sorceress rode beside him, crackling withmagic as she called a storm cloud above her.Separated into broad divisions to attack the city, tens of thousands marchedacross the forested hills. One division curled around to the northern end ofTanimura, while General Utros and Ruva directed the bulk of the army. Thedivision nearest Nicci and her militia entered the dark expanse of the HagenWoods just above the flattened ruins of Halsband Island. They ploddedrelentlessly forward, and once through the thick woods they would trample thelowtown and outlying residential areas to overwhelm the core of Tanimura.That was also the area Nicci knew best because of her time among the Sisters.She shouted to her fighters as she led them in that direction, “To the woods! Wewill use the forest to our advantage.”The Hagen Woods had long been a sinister place. The Sisters of the Dark hadperformed their bloody sacrifices and horrific initiation rituals here. Theplace was already soaked with blood, and now she would give the soil more.Thousands of eager militia members followed her. Rendell and Thaddeus seemed tobe competing with each other, racing ahead to fight back. On their way, thefighters crossed the city district nearest the bridges to Halsband Island, wherecountless clothiers, food merchants, craftsmen, candlemakers, weavers, andstonecutters had once thrived by serving the Palace of the Prophets, along withtaverns, gambling dens, and whorehouses that were patronized by the trainees ofthe Sisters. After the destruction of the palace, though, the district hadfallen on hard times, and many of the homes were abandoned.As her refugee fighters ran through the empty streets to intercept the armydivision, they passed a few families who huddled in their homes, mothers andfathers holding crude weapons ready to fight if the war came to them. Niccicalled back a warning: “We’ll try to hold them off, but if the soldiers breakthrough from the Hagen Woods, then you must flee. You can’t hope to stop them.”The ancient army had already flooded into the thick forest on their way to thelowtown, but Nicci paused at the edge of the dark pines and tangled oaks. “Thesedense woods will work to our advantage. The enemy soldiers will have to breakranks as they move through the trees. We’ll attack them and kill them. We cannotlet them reach the city.”Exuding confidence for the benefit of her ragtag fighters, Nicci marched intothe woods ready with her gift and with her dagger. The twisted branches andthick underbrush made running impossible, but her fighters worked their waycloser to where they could hear the clamor of the approaching army.Disappointingly, General Utros was not with this division, but she knew shewould have her moment to face him.She pulled in front of the others, intending to keep them safe. Not far ahead,she heard thousands of enemy soldiers crashing through the woods. She saw thefirst line of warriors shoving aside branches and underbrush, and they spottedher at the same time. Even though she wore a dark dress, her pale skin and blondhair made her visible in the gloom of the Hagen Woods.But thousands of them came yelling through the forest, eager to wipe out therefugee militia. The ancient warriors were flesh and blood again, but they weregaunt, hollow-eyed, their cracked lips drawn back. Desperation clung to themlike a tight garment.As ten bloodthirsty men rushed to cut her down, Nicci extended her gift, foundtwo large trees near the clump of soldiers. As she had done before, she heatedthe sap and flash-boiled the moisture inside the thick trunks. The liquidexpanded, exploded, and the shattered trees hurled sharp wooden stakes in alldirections. Just in time, she raised a shield to protect her own fighters, butthe flying splinters killed dozens of the enemy in an instant. The shatteredtree collapsed and toppled onto even more ancient soldiers.Nicci detonated another towering oak, which wiped out another group ofopponents, while additional ranks of the enemy division collided with hermilitia. Minimally trained but full of angry energy, the refugee fightersengaged in battle under the dark branches.Nicci flung out walls of air like battering rams to flatten lines of armoredwarriors. She burst the hearts of some, when she could focus her pinpointconcentration, she struck out with wizard’s fire, and when all else failed, sheused her dagger to cut throats and stab hearts.The ancient soldiers kept coming, plowing into the woods and driving back theoutnumbered militia. The enemy sacrificed themselves without even counting theirlosses. General Utros had given them orders to push forward and sweep into thecity, and they would not be deterred.Overwhelmed, Nicci’s refugees began to falter. Rendell had a deep gash in hisarm, and his leather helmet had been knocked off. Thaddeus pulled him to safetyas two attackers closed in on him.Even Nicci couldn’t stop them all, and she felt the tide turning. “Hold theline! We can’t let them get through to Tanimura.” She lashed out with everytrick she could think of, but her gift wasn’t infinite. The militia began tostumble back.But as her fighters faltered and retreated, a tan panther bounded in and mauledone of the ancient soldiers. Mrra flattened the man and tore out his throat.With a roar, the big cat turned her bloody muzzle toward Nicci and thrashed hertail. Nicci felt a surge of delight. “My sister panther!”More big cats dashed through the thick trees, dozens of them hidden by theforest shadows. As they struck, the ancient soldiers recoiled in primal fearevoked by the feline predators. Mrra’s new pride of cats was not large enough tothwart that many soldiers, but the terrified reaction was effective enough tomake them waver for a moment. Mrra bounded close enough to brush against Nicci,and then she sprang away to attack more victims.Nicci held her ground. Parts of the Hagen Woods were burning after her wizard’sfire, and many trees had fallen, shattered from within. The militia stiffenedtheir resistance and fought harder.Then more forms flowed through the thick forest like human shadows, a largefighting force of figures cloaked in gray. They attacked the ancient army fromits flank, causing a sudden uproar as Utros’s soldiers found themselves fightingon two fronts. The gray-robed people fell upon the enemy division, using antiqueswords to hack leather and chain mail, severing arms and heads, thrustingthrough ribs. The unexpected support gave Nicci’s militia another surge ofenthusiasm, and they pressed back, regaining the ground they had lost.Nicci recognized the unexpected reinforcements—the Hidden People! As they foughtin a shadowy blur, she saw a young woman with thin hair tied in a ponytail. Hergray hood had fallen back. “Asha! How did you all get here?”“We came to fight for you, Nicci.” The girl slashed with her sword, catching anenemy soldier in the back. “You freed us from the zhiss, and now it is only fairthat we help you.”Nicci was amazed. When the sliph had whisked her away from Orogang, GeneralUtros’s expeditionary force had filled the square, an overwhelming army. She hadthought sure the Hidden People would be massacred. “How did you escape from thesoldiers in Orogang?”Asha laughed. “Escape? We killed them all. We have far more people than youguessed! And we knew where you were going, since you showed us Tanimura on therelief map in the speaking chamber. We knew all the mountain passes, the rivers,and the cities, and we decided we had to come here. We followed your sandpanther.”Nicci felt an optimism that would have made even Bannon proud. “Good. Now we caneradicate this division.”They fought with redoubled fury and decimated the invaders. Nicci was sad to seehow many brave refugees also died in the forest, but over the next few hoursthey succeeded in wiping out the entire division.Nicci stood exhausted, her black dress stained and tattered from countlessslashes. The forest was a blood-soaked bog, and dead bodies lay piled severaldeep. Her surviving militia members rallied around her, proud that they hadmanaged to hold the Hagen Woods, but an even larger battle was still takingplace in the main city.Suddenly the branches in the nearby trees whipped about, leaves crackled, and ashimmering feminine form appeared in the air, the green-haloed outline of Ava.She looked outraged. “Utros will send you to the Keeper!”Nicci summoned the remnants of her gift to tear at the wavering spirit. “Ikilled you once already.”The spirit recoalesced from the onslaught and swooped among Nicci’s militia,causing fear but little harm. “Our army is many times stronger! Our forces willcrush you all.”Nicci said smugly, “And yet you will still be dead.”Screaming with frustration, Ava rattled the trees again. Nicci shoved with hergift, and the spirit swirled away. “I will tell General Utros where you are. Hewants to be the one to kill you.”After Ava vanished, Nicci looked into the empty air. Her defenders muttered infear, but she scoffed. “Let him try.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 79 [part0003.html#a7]The ships of the Serrimundi navy sailed north, following the Norukai fleet. Theserpent ships raced along toward Tanimura, completely unaware of the armoredvessels in pursuit. Olgya had summoned just enough mist to create a veil thathid them from the Norukai lookouts.Harborlord Otto rode at the front of the Mist Maiden, wrapping his hands aroundthe rail. Captain Ganley stood beside him, shading his eyes. “Are you tense? Oreager?”“They are ahead of us, and I don’t want to miss the battle,” Otto said. “I’mglad we saved Serrimundi from destruction, but we’re still part of this war.Imagine how much harm a whole Norukai fleet will inflict on Tanimura! A smallraiding party nearly wrecked Serrimundi harbor!”Chuckling, Ganley stroked his beard. “But this time we know how to fight back.And when we come at them unexpectedly, it will be like a knife in their backs.It is what they deserve.”Otto looked down to the water where the prow cut the waves into white foam. Hewas startled to see sleek figures swimming beside the Mist Maiden. At first hethought they were dolphins, but he recoiled when he recognized the human forms,the scaly skin, jagged fins. “Selka! Those are selka swimming beside our ship.”Ganley watched hundreds of the sleek forms streak toward Tanimura, like escortsfor the Serrimundi navy. “I don’t think we need to worry about them. The selkaand the Norukai are mortal enemies. Ours is not the flesh they wish to devour.”“We will feed them plenty after today’s battle,” Otto said.All of the Serrimundi vessels had been armored with metal plating at Nicci’sinsistence, and now their crews were trained with swords, spears, and boathooks. Dozens of expert archers were aboard each ship, ready with baskets ofpitch-wrapped fire arrows.Olgya joined them at the bow, her hair undone from her usual braids, the strandsuneven. She had used her gift to summon wind, pushing the metal-clad ships atgreater speed and closing the distance to the Norukai. Now that they approached,she stretched out her fingers and relaxed, undoing the mist spell that hadcreated a blurring veil around their ships. The fog dissipated, revealingthem . . . but the Norukai were looking forward, expecting nothing from the opensea behind them.Ahead, Otto could see Tanimura with its great harbor ten times the size ofSerrimundi’s. The tremendous battle had already begun, and he heard the shoutsand screams, the clang of metal, the hulls splintering as ships collided withthe harbor blockade. The Norukai rowed furiously, slamming into the line ofdefensive ships.“Nathan is there,” Olgya said, nodding to herself, “as well as Oron and Perri.They are putting up a strong gifted defense.”Otto could see many wrecked serpent ships sinking after being battered by asuccession of huge waves. “They’ve done good work already.”“And we’ll do more.” Olgya spread her arms wide and brought them together with aresounding clap. With the release of her gift, she sent a shock wave through thewater, creating a line that was at first a ripple, building higher and higherinto a great rolling wave that hurtled toward the rear of the attacking serpentships. “Our first blow will get their attention.”In the smooth wake behind Olgya’s wave, the harborlord saw streaking scaledfigures, hundreds of the muscular selka as they raced forward to join theattack. The rolling wave crashed into the rear line of serpent ships.On their decks, the Norukai fighters whirled and screamed in outrage at thesurprise attack. Then the selka surged up the hulls.Otto laughed, and Captain Ganley shouted for his archers. Within moments, ablizzard of flaming arrows arced through the sky and pelted the wood and sailsof the raider ships.But that was only the beginning. Closing in like the jaws of a trap, theSerrimundi ships joined the battle.*Nathan fought to keep his head above the blood-churned water. Grieve’s damagedship creaked against the weathered krakener, scraping the new armor plates witha flurry of sparks. When the waves buffeted him, he was nearly crushed betweenthe two hulls, but he used his gift to shove the ships apart and just barelysave himself. He sprayed water between his lips. “That would have been anembarrassing end for a great wizard.”On the Chaser’s deck above, he could hear the fighting, the clash of metal andbattering clubs. A dying Norukai splashed into the water beside him, clawing atthe gaping wound in his chest.Nathan’s boots and soaked cape weighed him down, but he kept himself afloat inthe rough waves and worked his way along the side of the Chaser. He yelled up,“Someone throw me a rope! I can help if I get up there.” Since they werefighting for their lives, though, no one paid attention to the man in the water.Nathan knew Bannon and Lila were skilled fighters, but the Norukai were nearlyinhuman. Frustrated, he dug in with his nails, trying to climb the wet and slimyhull boards. His boot found purchase on a clump of old barnacles, and he pulledhimself higher, reaching up until he caught the frame of a porthole above thewaterline. He grasped the lip of wood with his fingertips and used it forpurchase, straining to climb just a little higher until he was out of the water,dripping like a waterlogged dog.Partway up the hull, he found himself stuck. He couldn’t reach the rail stilltwo feet above his extended arm. He clawed for a higher grip, struggled to keephis footing, but the leather soles of his boots were smooth, and they slipped onthe boards. He tried to hold on to the porthole frame, but found himself fallingbackward. Instinctively, he used the gift to create a wall of wind. Under normalcircumstances, he would have used the push of air against an enemy, but now heused the same magic to form a cushion beneath him. With a hard shove, he usedthe burst of air to throw his body higher until he tumbled over the rail. Hesprawled across the deck, which was slippery with blood and old slime.He rolled to his feet, ready to fight. Bannon and Lila faced him, panting hardto catch their breath, both covered in blood. The headless corpse of King Grievelay on the deck, with an apelike Norukai woman sprawled next to him.Captain Jared and his men quickly cornered the few remaining Norukai aboard theChaser. Feeling left out, Nathan called a carefully directed bolt of lightningto blast the last raider standing.Bedraggled and drenched, Nathan stepped up to Bannon and clasped his shoulder.“Are you all right, my boy?”The young swordsman stared at the headless body of the Norukai king, and a smileslowly dawned on his face. “Yes, I’m just fine.”When Nathan shook his head, clumps of white hair flopped from side to side. Witha sniff, he summoned his gift, evaporated the water, and refreshed his clothes.“If we are going to have even a small victory, then my appearance shouldappropriately reflect it.”Bannon looked at the blood on his sword, Grieve’s blood. “Thank you again forthis fine blade, Nathan. I would have killed as many with Sturdy, but your swordwas perfectly acceptable.”“Glad you enjoyed it, my boy, but this little tussle is just a tiny ripple inthe overall battle for Tanimura.” He looked toward the shore. “We have much moreto do.” The momentum of the Norukai navy had been broken, but many serpent shipshad slipped past the blockade and pressed to shore, where the raiders were nowransacking the waterfront district. Fires rose from the city.Then Nathan stared in disbelief as General Utros’s army appeared in the hillsabove Tanimura!“Dear spirits, we—” Before he could get the words out, Nathan felt a black surgeinside, pain that echoed through his chest and entire body. The remnants of Ivanseized his heart, and Nathan dropped to his knees on the deck, gasping, unableto scream. His heart fought to keep beating.Thump, thump. Thump, thump.He had struggled to keep control of his new heart ever since Fleshmancer Andrehad finished his work, but all of Nathan’s good deeds had not cleansed thecorruption of that evil, violent man. He grimaced, curled back his lips. “No!You are dead. You . . . cannot . . . have your . . . heart.”Thump, thump. Thump, thump!Sparkles of pain drifted like black snowflakes inside his eyes. He clawed at hischest, but Ivan’s heart twisted as if turning itself inside out to punishNathan. “You are not there!” he wheezed through clenched teeth. “You’re notreal!”Lila and Bannon both grabbed his shoulders. “Nathan, what is it? How can wehelp?”He struggled against the spirit of Ivan.Thump, thump.Thump, thump.Thump.Nothing.Nathan’s eyes went wide as he felt his heart stop. He couldn’t breathe, and hefell forward onto the deck. He could sense nothing, only a void surrounding himlike a cocoon. He twitched, trying to reassert control over his body, over hisheart.Bannon and Lila were shaking him, and the krakener crew was shouting. Hescreamed silently inside his head as darkness suffocated him. Flickers of greenmist gathered around him, and he heard a tempting call, a whisper, then ademand. “You are dead. You are mine.”Was it the Keeper? Or Ivan?I am not, he thought, but his lips could not form words. His anger increased.The last vestiges of his gift tightened around him, and Nathan used every scrapof energy and determination he had. You cannot have your heart back.With a surge of his gift, he pushed his heart, made it beat, tore the blackpresence to tatters. Ivan retreated into his bloodstream, but still lurkedinside him. The greenish veil faded from his vision.Thump, thump.Thump, thump. Thump, thump.He heaved a great gasp of air. Bannon pulled him upright, pounded his back.“Nathan, are you all right?”“I’m alive. I just had a . . . disagreement with a visitor inside me.” Hedragged himself to his feet, but wobbled. “I am all right.” He brushed asidetheir concerns and turned to watch the enormous army of General Utros encroachon the outskirts of Tanimura. He knew he needed to be there, to stay alive so hecould help Nicci and the others with the grand fight.At the waterfront, many buildings were on fire, and he could see the furiousclash as General Zimmer and the D’Haran army tried to hold the harbor districtfrom the rampaging Norukai. But the enormous army of General Utros was a farlarger threat.Out in the water there were at least forty serpent ships still intact. Nathanclimbed to the krakener’s raised deck next to a disheveled Captain Jared, andthey both gazed past the naval battle to the open sea beyond the harbor, wherean unexpected group of warships was closing from behind. Nathan let out a cheer.Covered with blood, Bannon shaded his eyes. “Look! We have reinforcements!”Lila gave a nod of appreciation. “The navy from Serrimundi, of course. Theyfollowed, fully armed. They have come to join the fight.”An outcry of dismay rose from the remaining serpent ships, as the crews realizedthey would be crushed between two groups of attackers.Nathan smiled. “That should take care of King Grieve’s navy.”“Do not count a victory just yet.” Lila turned to look at the city, where thebreathtaking forces of General Utros were closing in. “We still have to defeatthat army, too.”Nathan realized their skills would be more vital for the battle inside the maincity. He shook his head. “No, I do not believe we can count on a victory anytimesoon. Captain Jared, we need you to take us to shore—posthaste!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 80 [part0003.html#a7]The smell of blood, sweat, and dust combined into a powerful and, for Zimmer,all-too-familiar odor. Though sickening, the smell also fired the blood in hisveins. It served as the fuel that kept him fighting.Tanimura’s waterfront warehouses burned behind him, and the blaze had alreadyspread to another block of large buildings. Bitter smoke mixed with the reek ofburning goods from the dockside market.As Zimmer squeezed his thighs to control his horse amid the mayhem, he could notcount all the fallen D’Haran soldiers in the streets. A few more serpent shipsground up to the docks and released a new horde of wild barbarians. But Zimmercalled the D’Haran army to shift their offensive. As a well-trained tacticalcommander, he knew that the ancient army of General Utros was a far greaterthreat than these chaotic Norukai. He directed his charge instead to meet thefirst lines of the invading ancient army.He raised his sword and yelled from the saddle, “All cavalry! Bear the brunt ofthe enemy advance, break their momentum. After that, archers, foot soldiers, itwill be your turn.”The horse hooves clattered on the paved streets as they rushed toward the firstdivision of the Utros army. One large force curved along the hills toward theHagen Woods and the lower city, and Nicci and her enthusiastic militia fightershad gone to cut off the advance there. Another segment of the army, ten thousandor more under the banner of the veteran First Commander Enoch, marched directlytoward the heart of the city.Utros’s strategy was clear. They would overwhelm and hold the center ofTanimura, then spread conquering forces throughout the districts, while theNorukai continued to ravage the harbor and the waterfront.Thorn and Lyesse sprinted just behind Zimmer. Even on foot, the two morazetheasily kept up with the cavalry riders. Thorn wasn’t even breathing hard as shecalled out, “Today is a day for much killing, General.”Lyesse chuckled. “I am glad we do not have to hide in the bushes anymore. I muchprefer a full fight!”Gripping the hilt of his sword as he rode, Zimmer nodded to the two women. “Youare welcome to cause as much mayhem as you like.”On the other side of the city, General Linden had marched his large portion ofthe D’Haran army to meet another division of the ancient army. He remembered adictum he had pounded into his soldiers when they faced impossible odds. “Everywar is a succession of battles. Each battle is won after many fights, hand tohand, sword to sword, life to life.”The D’Haran cavalry did not slow their charge as they careened into the ancientarmy. The enemy soldiers fought with an odd mixture of precision and abandon,and Zimmer recognized that something was not right about them. They seemedgaunter than the enemy he had fought at Cliffwall, more spent.His foot soldiers and archers jogged behind the cavalry, maintaining the generalshape of their ranks. Just ahead, Zimmer could see First Commander Enoch, a tallhardened veteran whose scarred face held the burden of countless battles. Fromhis dappled mount, Enoch’s icy eyes locked on Zimmer’s and knew his true foe.Although Zimmer was young for his rank, he carried the weight of many battles aswell.As if their minds were connected, both commanders yelled a challenge at the sametime, and the two men crashed together. Zimmer’s horse reared up, giving himheight as he hacked down with his sword. His blade struck against the veteran’schain mail, but Enoch parried, clashed his sword against his opponent’s. Theolder man surprised Zimmer by releasing the reins and grabbing a dagger in hisother hand. He caught Zimmer in the side, cut into his leather armor, but onlyenough to scratch his ribs.The screams, the impact of steel, the terrified snorts of horses, and thepounding of hooves swirled around him like tangible thing. Zimmer’s horseskittered sideways, and Enoch pressed in, his face filled with pinpointconcentration for the battle at hand. Zimmer wheeled his mount and used thesaddle as a fulcrum for his attack. The two horses were like equine batteringrams.The line of D’Haran archers arrived behind the cavalry, nocking their arrows andlaunching a fusillade of projectiles over the heads of the front lines to showerdown upon the ranks behind Enoch. Hundreds of enemy soldiers dropped, and thearchers let fly as fast as they could nock and draw. D’Haran foot soldiers camebehind the archers, hacking at any encroaching enemy warriors to protect thebowmen.Oliver and Peretta each carried a large hunting knife, which was easier to wieldthan a sword. Never straying far from her two friends, Amber did her ownfighting. The gifted young novices were not strong enough to unleash sweepingdevastation like Nicci or Nathan, but they were clever and effective with theirstrikes. Together, they used their gift to work small, effective spells. Withflickers of fire, they heated the hilts of the enemy swords, which made theyelping soldiers drop them in pain.Peretta called out to her friends, “Intense fire is difficult to make, but wecan use bright light instead. That’s easy. Blind them!”Oliver grinned. “Yes, the flash spell!” He twisted his fingers and muttered thewords he needed for focus. A burst of light blossomed directly before the eyesof an attacking soldier like an erupting star. The man slapped a hand to hiseyes and stumbled into another soldier. Unable to see, he swung instinctivelyand stabbed his own comrade.Triumphant, Oliver, Peretta, and Amber repeated their flash spell in the facesof other warriors.Arabella and Mab, the only two Sisters of the Light still with Zimmer’s troops,were more formidable opponents. They rode on each flank of the main cavalry andhurled buffeting winds strong enough to stagger the enemy ranks.“By the Creator, we have our work cut out for us,” Mab said.A glowing female form swooped in over the advancing army, the pale shade ofUtros’s dead sorceress. Shrieking with mad laughter, Ava’s spirit joined FirstCommander Enoch. Though intangible, Ava could still use the remnants of her giftto send disruptive waves through the D’Haran soldiers and spook their horses.Ava swooped directly through the mounts, terrifying them, and the panickedhorses pawed at the air, wheeling sideways and colliding into one another.Ava’s features transformed into the face of a gaunt demon with a wide,fang-filled mouth, her eyes sunken into dark hollows. The D’Haran soldiersslashed the air, their swords cutting harmlessly through her wispy form.First Commander Enoch kicked his horse in the ribs and charged forward. Zimmerbrought up his sword to parry the blow, but Enoch struck with all the might ofhis battle-hardened muscles. Suddenly a bright flash like a solar flare burst infront of Enoch’s face, blinding him. He grabbed at his eyes, too late to shieldthem from the dazzling burst.Oliver, Peretta, and Amber cheered, then turned their unique attack upon otherenemy soldiers.Zimmer’s horse slammed into his opponent’s, hurling the old veteran from hissaddle. Enoch landed and rolled before stumbling back to his feet, unable to seebut sweeping his sword from side to side. Knowing that First Commander Enoch washis main foe, Zimmer swung out of his saddle and dropped to the ground. Enochstabbed at the air as he struggled to see.Nearby, Thorn and Lyesse fought with wild abandon, grinning wolfishly with aweapon in each hand. Spatters of blood flecked their skin. The scant blackleather garments provided little protection, but neither morazeth needed it.They hacked from victim to victim, moving on to the next target even before thelast one fell to the ground.“Fourteen!” Thorn cried as she stabbed another man through the ribs.“Sixteen for me,” Lyesse said. “You better catch up, sister.”“We will take stock when the day is done.”A giant-statured warrior loomed in front of Lyesse. Each of his biceps waslarger than her head as he lifted a two-handed sword, but Lyesse slashed himacross the stomach, then slid her blade through the gap in his thigh armor andinto his groin. She dodged out of the way as the giant bleated like a sheep inthe slaughter pen and crashed to the ground.Ava’s spirit swooped in to terrorize Thorn and Lyesse, but when the intangiblespirit tried to pass through their bodies with a disruptive tingle, theprotective runes blocked her, and she ricocheted off of them. Flustered, thedead sorceress whirled off to attack someone else.As his horse galloped away, Zimmer regained his balance on the ground. For themoment, he would face First Commander Enoch on foot. He shouted, “My name isGeneral Zimmer, and I command the D’Haran army. I want you to know the name ofthe man who will defeat you.”The veteran was still blinking the dazzling colors from his eyes, but he sensedZimmer close to him. He raised his sword and struck out, poking the air andyelling. “You haven’t defeated me yet!” Enoch drove forward in a flurry, chasingthe other man’s voice. Each time his sword struck Zimmer’s, his aim grew better.“You have seen our army, Zimmer. Why bother fighting? Surrender and join theconquerors. Your bodies don’t have to litter this entire city.”“The Keeper will take me when he wishes,” Zimmer said. He was impressed at howwell the man fought.They clashed again. Enoch squinted, blinking furiously as his vision began toreturn. Two riderless horses charged by, nearly trampling them, and Zimmerjumped out of the way. With foam flying from the bits in their mouths, thefrightened horses ran away.Zimmer spun to defend himself as Ava’s shimmering spirit rose in front of him,laughing. She swooped toward him like a vulture, harrying him, and heinstinctively tried to block her with his sword. The green glow intensified withher anger. As her intangible form engulfed him, he felt her dark, twisted poweroozing inside his body like an appalling violation, a filthy finger probing intohis heart.Ava’s spirit had spied for General Utros, exposed the hidden Cliffwall archive.Because of her, Utros had attacked Cliffwall, which brought about thedestruction of the archive and the death of Prelate Verna. This spirit hadcaused so much misery, so much death!As Ava swirled around him, flickering, Zimmer hacked in the air with his sword.Her mocking laughter taunted him, and he tried to stab her, even though he knewhe could never kill a spirit. The green glow flared brighter.With all his strength, he thrust his sword through the dead sorceress’s chest,but the killing thrust passed through her as if she were no more than smoke.Instead, he felt the hard impact of something solid crunch against the blade. Hethrust harder, shoving the point all the way through leather and chain mail, andthen a solid chest.Shrieking, Ava swirled away to reveal to Zimmer that he had skewered FirstCommander Enoch through the heart. The old veteran had lurched up to him, hiddenby the dead sorceress’s flickering form.Impaled on the sword, Enoch coughed blood. His sword slipped out of his limpfingers and dropped with a clang to the ground. He touched the steel, blinkingin wonder. “This is . . . death. At last.” His body fell as gravity pulled himoff of Zimmer’s sword. “There you are, Camille . . . my love.”Ava flickered away, furious. Enoch dropped onto his side with blood bubblingfrom the wound in his chest. The veteran stretched out a gauntlet, reaching forsomething that only he could see.Though the furious battle continued around him, Zimmer stared. Time seemed tostop, and he gave his enemy a chance to die. Enoch gasped, “Alex and Aaron, mysons . . .” He smiled. “You no longer have to beg for me. The Keeper can havewhat he wants.”He slumped back and died. Zimmer’s vision was uncertain, but he thought he sawfaint forms rising from the ground, arms outstretched and pulling another dimoutline down with them.But even with the first commander dead, the invading army came forward,unstoppable."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 81 [part0003.html#a7]Even with as much harm as they had done to the Norukai fleet and the army ofGeneral Utros, Nicci could see that Tanimura was about to fall. She had not seena battle so overwhelming since the armies of Emperor Jagang besieged thePeople’s Palace.The surviving members of her militia withdrew from the Hagen Woods, leaving abloodbath behind them, but as they crossed into the city, they encountered wavesof constant fighting. Utros’s main force pushed toward the center of Tanimura,while other contingents spilled into every street, where they ransackedbuildings and battled their way through makeshift barricades the defenders haderected. The fighting took place in houses, alleys, rooftops, and streets, andthe city’s outnumbered defenders used that to their advantage.In an open public square ahead, Nicci spotted the banners of General Linden andhis D’Haran soldiers, and they were fighting in what looked like a last stand.She led her militia there to join them in the fight; she could see they neededher.The Hidden People accompanied her, racing along in their gray robes. Many hadfallen in the Hagen Woods, but they did not count their dead. Breathing hard,young Asha had a knife-edged smile. “We traveled across the continent for you,Nicci. We will fight for you now.”The rest of the Hidden People were just as determined, carrying swords from theweapons stockpile they had stewarded in Orogang. For more than a thousand years,they had waited for General Utros to return, but their hero had cruelly turnedagainst them. Now the deadly people, and the pride of ferocious sand panthers,might shift the balance here and save Linden and his troops.Fighting their way through city streets, Nicci’s followers slew hundreds more asthey drove like a wedge through the invaders, cutting off an entire group andkilling them down to the last man.Ahead, Linden’s regiments had taken up a defensive position in a square enclosedby high buildings. His D’Haran soldiers stood several ranks deep, with an outerline of shields as a barricade. Archers in the rear launched volleys of arrowsinto the enemy army, but the invaders crashed into them like waves against arocky shore. Linden shouted ever-more-desperate commands, and a standard-bearerbeside him raised a flag showing the colors of D’Hara and the stylized letter“R” for the House of Rahl.The defensive line held firm until an unexpected part of the flank began tocrumble. Under the constant barrage, the shield line buckled and dozens of enemywarriors raged through as if it were a hemorrhaging wound. They ran past theshield line, which then closed behind them and re-formed, stronger than before.Nicci smiled at the clever trick. Thirty enemy warriors, now trapped inside theline, were all cut down, one by one.Amid the great ground battle, unexpected lightning drew a zigzag line in theair, and the energy struck an ancient subcommander and his adjutant at the frontof the enemy charge. The blast shattered the victims into smoking pieces.Looking for the source of the surprising attack, Nicci was amazed to see awizard with long white hair dressed in a fine cape and vest. “Nathan!” Hecouldn’t hear her over the sounds of battle, but when she extended her fingersto the sky and brought them down, Nicci drew her own lightning bolt toincinerate three more soldiers next to the ones he himself had killed.That got the wizard’s attention. Nathan waved, and beside him Bannon and themorazeth Lila also shouted, glad to see her.Using a battering ram of wind to clear the way, Nicci led her surviving militiamembers to reinforce Linden’s troops, disrupting the ancient army and causing apanic. The prowling sand panthers tore at the enemy soldiers, but Mrra herselfwas reluctant to leave Nicci’s side, now that they were reunited at last.Nicci fought her way close to General Linden and his beleaguered troops. Sheunleashed another bolt of branched lightning, which strafed the front lines ofenemy fighters, and still more of them flooded into the city. Already exhausted,Nicci dug deep into her reserves of energy.Knowing the stakes, she resorted to a darker form of destruction, pulling upondangerous Subtractive Magic. She called upon that side of the gift only when itwas absolutely necessary, for those were the skills she had learned when she wasa Sister of the Dark. Now she served the D’Haran Empire, and she served Richard.Her heart was strong enough to handle it.She opened herself, stretched out her gift in both the positive and negativedirections to draw another bolt of lightning, but this time she joined it withan infinitely dark crack in the sky, like a mirror image entangled with thewhite bolt. The zigzagging blast killed more than a hundred in a single strike.The fury of her lightning stunned the front ranks of the enemy division, drivingback their charge and giving Nicci’s militia the window they needed to surgeforward and reinforce Linden’s troops.“Thank you, Sorceress.” Linden looked ready to drop from exhaustion and bloodloss. His shield was splintered, and his leather armor and chain mail wereragged from many blows.Nathan strode up to her, grinning. “Dear spirits, I’m glad to see you! I knowyou rarely use Subtractive Magic, but that was sorely needed.” He watched theHidden People join the defensive line and raised his eyebrows. “Oh, I see youfound some friends.”Bannon’s ginger hair was matted with blood and sweat, but his hazel eyes shone.“Now we can all fight together! The Norukai are mostly defeated, and CaptainJared took us to the docks so we could help here in the city.” Barely able tocontain his own news, he blurted out, “At least King Grieve is dead.”That got Nicci’s attention. “How did he die? Badly, I hope.”“The boy killed him,” Lila answered with clear pride. “Cut off his head.”Nicci rewarded the young swordsman with a gratified nod. “Well deserved.”“We broke the backbone of the Norukai fleet out there on the water, and theSerrimundi navy arrived just in time to attack them from behind.” Nathan lookedbeyond the square to the sweeping harbor, where innumerable serpent ships weresunk or burning in the water. But the Norukai did not go quietly. The fightingcontinued to rage on the water, and many of the landed raiders still pillagedthe streets.Worse, though, General Utros’s army continued to ransack Tanimura, and severaldivisions were closing in from all sides. From the defended square, Nicci couldsee Utros in his distinctive horned helmet surveying the attack from highground. The general sat on his black stallion, directing his troops with thepainted sorceress at his side. Given time, his army could simply trampleTanimura to dust, leaving only a flat expanse of rubble, just like HalsbandIsland.Smoke rolled into the sky from the burning buildings, and the air resounded withbattle. Screaming seagulls wheeled overhead, anxious for the feast they wouldhave with all the dead bodies piled in the streets.Nathan looked ashen as he caught his breath. “I have used so much of my magicalready today that I’m afraid I have little left.” He regarded her with relief.“At least you can still draw on Subtractive Magic, which is something the restof us cannot do.”“If that is what’s necessary,” Nicci answered with a frown. “We promised Richardwe would protect D’Hara, and he knows my abilities. I’ll do anything to stopUtros from marching north into the New World. Richard has his own problemsthere. He left this to me.”She had to stop the enemy here and now, because she loved Richard too much. Shelonged to see him one last time, though she had long ago accepted that she wouldnever have his love in return. Nevertheless, his respect, his friendship, hiscomplete confidence gave Nicci strength she didn’t know she had. He believed inher . . . and he said he’d given her everything she needed. Richard would neverabandon her.She thought of the small bone box and the glowing constructed spell. Despite herbest efforts, she had been unable to decipher what Richard meant. Life to theliving. Death to the dead. What did that mean? And how could she use it?So many brave fighters were already dead, and Utros’s ancient army kept coming.The great military force should have been dead many centuries ago, but thepetrification spell from the wizards of Ildakar had thwarted the Keeper. Everysingle fighter wearing the flame symbol should have gone to the underworld long,long ago.Death to the dead. . . .With a sudden idea, she snatched out the bone box from her pocket and held it inher bloodstained palm. When the blood touched the bone, the energy of spilledlife affected the delicate container and the scratched symbols. The markingsintensified, glowed.Life to the living. Death to the dead.Thoughts clicked together in her mind, and she suddenly understood what wasnecessary, the missing piece she had forgotten. The answer had been there, butshe hadn’t looked for it in the right way. She hadn’t thought the way Richardwould think.When trying to analyze the glowing, rotating sphere, she had performed a testshe knew well. An obvious test. But while she had used Subtractive Magic toignite a verification web, she had not used it on the constructed spell itself.It was a form of constructed spell that contained a bit of original magic fromthe design of the Wizard’s Keep, from a time when wizards also possessedSubtractive Magic. Such a defensive spell from the Keep, she realized, had tocontain Subtractive elements. Richard would have known that. Why hadn’t she seenit right away? No wonder Nathan, the Cliffwall scholars, and the Sisters of theLight had not been able to help her.Her pulse raced faster as the answers came to her in the din of the surroundingbattle. Without Subtractive Magic, the spell would be sterile! That was whyNicci could not find anything meaningful when she had initially tried todecipher the contents by touching the tiny sphere with her power.It would not be meaningful without the direct injection of the Subtractiveelement! That was the missing piece.Now she knew what to do, and it was indeed everything she needed, just asRichard said.Nicci snapped shut the bone box again, covering the glowing spell. A hard smilecrossed her face. She saw General Utros on higher ground outside the city, buthe was far away, with an entire army between himself and Nicci. She had to getcloser.“I need to get a message to Utros,” she said. “An ultimatum.”Hidden People slipped in among the attacking soldiers, killing many and thendarting away. They were used to moving in the shadows. They crowded in amongGeneral Linden’s armed warriors, and Nicci called to get their attention. “Asha!I need you. I have a task for the Hidden People, and the war may depend on it.”Asha killed another enemy soldier and withdrew, still holding her bloody knife.Five more Hidden People heard the call and fell back to present themselves. “Weare ready to do whatever you need, Nicci.”She leaned closer to the few eager volunteers. “No matter what it takes, I needyou to get a message to General Utros. Go around the army or go through them,hide, dodge, but get to him by any means necessary.” She pointed to the distantfigure high above the storm of battle. “Tell the general that I demand to speakto him. Have him meet me on Halsband Island.” She paused, and then added with ahard smile, “Tell him it is Nicci—the one who killed his sorceress Ava. He willcome.”Nathan’s eyes went wide. “Dear spirits, do you know what you’re doing?”She felt the bone box in her pocket. “I’m absolutely certain. Richard told methis is all I need. General Utros has to come face me.”Young Asha nodded and looked to her fellow Hidden People. “We will go for you,Nicci. At least one of us will deliver the message, at all costs.”They flitted away through the streets, where their shadowy cloaks made theminvisible in the raging battle.*As the fight continued and the ancient soldiers swept through the streets ofTanimura, Oliver struggled not to feel dismay. For every soldier that fell, tenmore swept in behind him. It was like trying to empty the sea with a bucket.Fearless, Peretta stood holding up her hands and curling her fingers to summonbright flashes of light she could throw into the faces of the enemy. The ancientsoldiers saw what she was doing, though, and that made Peretta a target.Oliver watched an archer draw an arrow and aim toward her, pulling back thestring. “Peretta!” Oliver screamed, but she couldn’t move in time as the archerlet fly. Instead, he remembered the training and pushed a gust of wind, creatinga burst of air that deflected the arrow’s trajectory just enough so that itbarely scratched the young woman’s shoulder as it streaked past.Peretta ducked, wincing at the fresh wound, then grinned at him. “Thank you,Oliver.”In retaliation, she blinded the archer with a flash of light, and Oliversummoned a small burst of heat that snapped the bowstring. Released, the bowsprang back, smacking the soldier in the head.Amber joined them. “We have to find a better way to fight. These spells, one ata time, can’t defeat such a huge army.”“We’re fighting as best we can,” Peretta said.Amber’s face was flushed. “But everything we studied at Cliffwall, all that welearned—there must be something we can use!”Oliver shook his head. “We found the magic to summon all those poisonousscorpions from beneath the ground. That proved to be quite effective.” Hesighed. “But there are no scorpions here in the city.”“Not scorpions . . . but what else does a city have?” Amber asked. Her lipsquirked in an eager smile, waiting for them to answer.Oliver didn’t know what she meant. He had very little experience with cities.Cliffwall was clean and compact, and he had rarely been elsewhere. Cities likeTanimura seemed dirty to him, crowded and unpleasant. Peretta also shook herhead.Amber’s eyes gleamed. “Rats! Beneath any city there are thousands of rats.”“Oh! We could use the same summoning magic,” Peretta said, understanding whatshe meant. “Call up the rats from the sewers, from the alleys, gutters, andmidden heaps.”A D’Haran captain with his group of beleaguered defenders shouted a cry ofdefiance as they were surrounded by overwhelming enemies. Raising his sword, thecaptain yelled for the others to join him in a fight to the death. He led ahundred soldiers against a wall of ancient warriors marching through a square.“Quickly!” Amber knelt and placed her hands against the flagstones of thesquare. Peretta and Oliver joined her, shoulder-to-shoulder. “Remember what weused for the scorpions. Call them—call them all! Can you feel them?”Oliver sensed the tingling in his fingers. “Yes, I think so. Little and furry,but with sharp teeth.”“And hungry,” Peretta added. “They are very hungry.”With their combined gift, they reached out, sent a call. While the minds of thescorpions had been tiny and susceptible, the rats were more intelligent. But thethree young companions were able to convince the rodents that this was what theywanted to do.Oliver could sense scurrying feet, furry bodies rising up from the sewers,running through the gutters. The creatures swirled out of Tanimura’s underbelly,all claws and teeth, naked pink tails and red eyes.The D’Haran captain’s sortie slowed, defeated by a horde of enemy soldiers thatsurrounded them. Blood sprayed as ten enemies fought against every defender,hacking them down one by one, until the brave captain himself was dragged to theground.As the defenders fell, though, the rats boiled up from the streets in a brownwave of death, just like all the scorpions that had erupted from the desertfloor back at Cliffwall. They were dirty vermin that lived beneath the moist andnoisome shadows of the streets, but they also defended their city.The invaders howled and flailed as they suddenly faced this ravenous wave thatfell upon them, thousands of furry bodies that crawled up their legs and gnawedtheir skin, tore through chinks in their armor. Though they thrashed theirweapons and clawed with their gauntleted hands, the enemy soldiers could notfight against it. Their voices became a panicked outcry, and their disciplined,regimented advance across the square broke apart.Oliver, Peretta, and Amber watched, shaking with fear and awe, as innumerablerats fed upon the enemy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 82 [part0003.html#a7]Tanimura had already fallen. General Utros knew he had won.From his high vantage above the city, he could watch the ebb and flow of thefighting. He had encountered setbacks, as in every war. One entire division ledby Second Commander Halders had entered the thick forest in a flanking move, andhad never emerged. Something in that dark woods had defeated them.But Utros had more soldiers, many more. King Grieve’s Norukai had caused greatcarnage in the harbor and on the waterfront, but they were mostly broken. He hadnever relied on those brutish allies for this conquest, though he was happy tolet them bear the brunt of so many casualties. He would mop up the rest of themas soon as he quelled the other fighting, but that wouldn’t take long.First Commander Enoch had taken five thousand men in a central prong straightinto Tanimura. Second Commander Arros drove another division of five thousandalong the western hills and into the rich nobles’ district. More of hissoldiers, tens of thousands, were still on the outskirts waiting to surge in andplunder. Tanimura could do nothing to stop his victory.But he couldn’t understand what Nicci was up to. What did her brash messagemean? She was in no position to make demands.As Utros stood pondering, the pale young captive struggled in his grip. Hesqueezed his gauntleted hand around the girl’s throat and lifted her off theground. Her small feet jittered and twitched, trying to touch the dirt, butUtros raised her higher, squeezed tighter. With minimal effort he could crushher larynx and snap her neck, but he needed the girl to speak first. “Tell meagain what Nicci said. Every word.”“Meet her,” the captive gurgled. “Nicci demands it. On Halsband Island.” Thegirl flailed her hand toward the barren island connected to the main city bynew, rickety bridges.Ruva chuckled. “Each of the messengers said the same words.”“Why? What does she want?” Utros pressed his face closer to the dying girl, whoshowed no fear. Her mouth gaped like that of a fish left to bake in the sun, butshe couldn’t speak any words. He paused, furrowing his brow. “I recognize yourgarments, your pale skin. You are one of the worms hiding in our sacred capitalof Orogang. You attacked my men.”The young woman clutched uselessly at his hand, trying to draw a breath. “Youattacked us! Orogang has always been ours.”“Orogang is mine—my capital.” Utros squeezed tighter, and her eyes bulged. “Whydoes Nicci want me to come to that island? Why?” Forgetting himself, he squeezedtoo hard, and her neck cracked. The girl fell limp.Disgusted, Utros tossed her body to the ground, discarding her beside the otherfour Hidden People who had delivered exactly the same message. Through hisgolden half mask, he frowned at all the broken corpses, turned to Ruva, then tothe open island. “Is it a trap?”Ruva’s eyes carried an edge of madness. “It may be a trap, but it will not work.Never! We are stronger!” The sorceress had grown more violent, more volatilethan he had seen her before. She claimed that the Keeper called to both her andher sister through the veil, but Utros would not release them to the underworld.Not yet.Ruva suddenly calmed, considered, then shrugged. “How could Nicci possibly layan ambush there? It is open, indefensible.” She smiled. “No, she wants tosurrender, beloved Utros. There is no other explanation.”Utros shook his head in consternation. “Why would she do that? Even if we cometo terms, Nicci thinks that I can snap my fingers and stop the army? They’restarving, and now at last they have their victory. I can’t control them, norwould I want to. After today they will all eat well even if they have to pickTanimura clean.” He swelled his chest. “Afterward, my army will be strong andready to march again, the way they were meant to be.”“If Nicci wants to surrender, let her do it,” Ruva said, sounding hungry. “Thenwe can kill her.”Ava’s spirit shimmered before them, pale and insubstantial, more diluted than hehad ever seen her. “Kill Nicci the way she killed me!” Ava folded herself on topof her twin sister, and they both laughed. “You must confront her. She createsher own doom.”“Yes, beloved Utros. You must do this. We want her, my sister and I. And youwant her. Nicci opens her arms to embrace death, and we will kill her.” Ruva wasready to explode with eagerness.Utros remained wary, but he allowed himself to be convinced. He also wanted tocrush the sorceress who had taken his precious Ava from him. “Yes, you deserveyour revenge, and I will grant it. I wanted to face Nicci on the battleground,but this saves me the trouble of finding her.” He turned away from the deadmessengers, thinking no more of them. “Bring a hundred troops as an escort. Wewill meet her on the island and put an end to this.” He bunched his fists. “Sheis a fool.”*The joy in Thorn’s voice was palpable, and she showed her exuberance bydecapitating her opponent. “That’s seventy for me, sister.” The ancientwarrior’s neck stump spouted blood, and the lumbering body took two staggeringsteps before it slumped forward. “Seventy! Can you beat that?”“Only sixty-five for me,” Lyesse said. With greater intensity, she spun aboutand dove into two armored soldiers who closed in on her. She stabbed one in thestomach, whirled and kicked the other back, knocking him off balance so that theedge of his sword missed her. She withdrew her blade from the already dying man,stabbed again to kill him, and turned to dispatch the first man she had knockedoff balance. “Sixty-six and sixty-seven! I will catch up with you.”Thorn laughed. “You may try.” She turned, determined, leaping forward—And ran directly into a serrated spear point.A broad-shouldered man gritted his teeth and shoved the spear harder. He grinnedas he skewered the lean morazeth on his weapon, pushing the spear all the waythrough her abdomen and out her back.Thorn coughed blood. Her knees went weak, and she could barely stand, but thespear itself held her up. She grabbed the shaft, tried to hold on.Lyesse screamed and hacked at another warrior in her way, wounding him. Shedidn’t bother to follow through as she leaped toward her sister morazeth.The spear wielder wrenched his weapon, tried to yank the blade back so he coulddefend himself against Lyesse’s furious attack, but Thorn clutched the shaft andrefused to let it go, even as she died. She prevented him from having his weaponback.Lyesse screamed again and struck down with such fury that she amputated both ofthe warrior’s hands that gripped the weapon. Her blade splintered the shaftitself. The spear wielder stared in horror at his bleeding wrists, and shestabbed him in the throat. He had killed her companion, her sister morazeth!Without the spear to hold her up, Thorn crumpled to the ground.Lyesse was deaf to all of the battlefield sounds. Thorn was breathing heavily.Her words came out in liquid, bubbly chokes. “Seventy killed in one day,” shegasped. “Seventy.” She reached out to clasp the hand of her sister.Lyesse cradled the dying woman. “A good number, one that any morazeth wouldadmire.”Thorn gripped her with red, wet fingers. “My score . . . is yours. I grant youall my kills.”“I accept them, and I will add many more in your name.”Lyesse sensed the instant when the Keeper claimed Thorn’s spirit. Though timeseemed to stop for an infinitely long moment, she held the other morazeth whilethe battle continued to rage. Lyesse gently set her sister’s body aside.As she saw countless soldiers continuing to crash into Tanimura, she knew thatshe had more than enough targets to reach the greatest score any morazeth hadever achieved."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 83 [part0003.html#a7]Uneasy but trying not to second-guess Nicci’s plan, Nathan followed thesorceress as she made her way across the new wooden bridge that connected thelowtown to Halsband Island. The flattened expanse had served as a practice fieldfor the Tanimuran soldiers and the refugee militia as they prepared for war, butthe rubble gave the island a haunted, abandoned air. Nicci seemed to think itwas perfect for her needs now.If only General Utros would come. Nicci had no doubts at all.Bannon and Lila walked in tandem as their small group made their way to themeeting point. The young man carried Nathan’s ornate sword, and it seemed a partof him now.After killing King Grieve, Bannon was hardened and also restored. Even so,Nathan feared that the bright, hopeful young man would never get back hisfoolish optimism. For a long time he had clung to a positive façade as a defenseagainst the cruelties he had experienced in life, but now Bannon was strong andwhole, with an iron will. He was not a victim and he did not complain about allthe times he’d been beaten down. Instead, he drew strength and built bonds whereothers would only have sought vengeance.His surprising relationship with Lila, for example, was a partnership that madeboth of them stronger. Nathan didn’t know if he himself would have been sostrong or so forgiving of a woman who had been his captor and harsh trainer.He realized that for his own part, after the Sisters of the Light had locked himup in the palace for so long, Nathan had come to love Prelate Ann, and he hadalso respected and admired Prelate Verna. Those women had been his captors, yethe had managed to resolve his differences with them. In a way, he understoodBannon.As they prepared for their desperate gambit, battles raged across the city, andhundreds if not thousands of Norukai continued to pillage and burn down theharbor district. Even if Nicci defeated General Utros here, the ancient armywould keep devastating the city. He believed that Tanimura was doomed, no matterwhat happened here on Halsband Island.But Nathan trusted Nicci, and he held on to hope. He saw her rigid back, themuscles that rippled beneath the black fabric of her dress. He could sense herbuilding up her strength for a final confrontation. Mrra prowled alongside them,inseparable from Nicci.They followed crushed pathways where military maneuvers had packed down therubble. Nathan tried to make out the foundations of the fallen Palace of theProphets, the remnants of the immense towers that had imprisoned him for tencenturies. “Once I escaped, I hoped never to return here,” he said aloud. “Withthe whole world to explore, why would I go back to a place with such sourmemories?”“You are here with us,” Bannon said.“And we are about to face the commander of an army that intends to conquer theworld,” Lila added.Nathan stroked his chin. “For a reason like that, I can come back to HalsbandIsland one more time.”Nicci found an acceptable spot and stopped. Nathan realized this was where thearched entrance of the palace had stood. Through the stones beneath his bootsand the shimmering silence that resonated with power, he felt a calm like theeye of the storm.Nicci stood silent with the big sand panther at her side. Mrra’s whiskerstwitched with anticipation. Bannon and Lila held their swords and tried to lookintimidating, as if they were Nicci’s elite guard. Nathan’s embroidered capewaved in the breeze.Finally, they watched a large party of mounted soldiers come riding over thebridge toward them, led by a standard-bearer with the flame banner of theancient empire. General Utros rode at the fore. The slender sorceress pacedbeside him on her horse. The general’s retinue consisted of more than a hundredsoldiers, but Nicci did not seem intimidated by the numbers. Nathan had neverseen her look so confident.Nathan stood ready to fight for the sake of D’Hara. As the thought calmed him,centered him, he suddenly felt a surge of hot poison through his chest. Hisheart hammered as the dark spirit of Ivan tried to take over again, but Nathangrimaced, clenched his fists, and hissed in a harsh whisper, “Why won’t youdie?” He pounded his sternum, and the dark presence swirled away.Utros and his escort soldiers looked bloodied and weary, but their faces shonewith anticipation. Nothing matched the madness of Ruva’s expression. Her eyeswere like fractured gems that held remnants of lightning. Utros sat tall in hissaddle like a predatory beast as he pulled his horse to a halt and glared atNicci.Nathan kept his voice low. “I hope you know what you’re doing, Sorceress.”Nicci just smiled. “I am not worried.” She touched the pocket of her dress. “Itis my job to take care of the entire enemy army.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 84 [part0003.html#a7]Although she could see only half of his face, Nicci could tell that GeneralUtros already believed he was victorious. Resplendent in his leather armor, herode toward her like a supreme conqueror. His escort soldiers clustered close,ready to defend their general, and his standard-bearers raised Iron Fang’sancient flame symbol, which he now claimed as his own.Nicci faced him in only a bloodstained black dress. She lifted her soft chin,and her blond hair flowed freely around her head. She ignored the rest of thesoldiers, didn’t even acknowledge the painted sorceress at his side. “I wasn’tcertain you would be brave enough to face me, General Utros.”The horses shifted on the broken stones, but the escort riders forced them intorigid ranks. The men looked gaunt, their skin pale except where it was streakedwith blood, particularly around their mouths.Utros tilted his horned helmet down at her, and she could see his eye blazingthrough the hole in the gold half mask. “It takes little courage to face thevanquished.” He gestured expansively behind him. “The city has already fallen.There is nothing you can do but surrender. I am glad you realize that.”Nicci remained silent.Mrra growled low in her throat. Nathan, Bannon, and Lila stood ready to protectNicci, but they looked insignificant surrounded by Utros’s escort guard. Even inthe isolation of Halsband Island, the sounds of continuing battles wafted fromthe main city, but Nicci heard only the blood rushing in her ears, felt herstrength rising.Ruva glared from her bay horse. Much of the pale sorceress’s carefully appliedpaint had flaked off, leaving only muddled messages. Her shoulders jerked withanticipation. “I want her, beloved Utros.”A flitting spirit appeared in the air, Ava’s glowing shadow. “We want her!”Ruva laughed. “Send her to the Keeper, and then maybe he will leave us alone! Mysister can stay with me.”Ava’s shimmering form swirled close, overlapping with her twin. “We will staytogether. Always together.”General Utros swung out of his saddle and dropped to the ground in front ofNicci. His boots crunched on the loose stones of the Palace of the Prophets. Theescort guard sat motionless, as if they had turned to statues again.Still she said nothing, merely faced him with a stony expression.Utros loomed over Nicci. “Nothing you say will change the outcome of this day.No concessions you make will alter my victory. I came here to destroy you. Therewill be no surrender terms. My army will enslave any people still alive inTanimura. We will rest in this city and rebuild, and when I have restored myarmy to its full strength with thousands of new recruits, we will march northand conquer all of D’Hara. I will achieve even more than what Emperor Kurgandemanded of me. I will rule both the Old World and the New.”Nathan stepped closer to the implacable Nicci and defied the general. “EmperorKurgan is long dead, just as you should be.”Utros looked at the wizard as if he were an annoying distraction. “Iron Fang isthe past. I am the new emperor.”“Your allies are defeated,” Bannon blurted out. “Look out at the harbor! TheNorukai navy is destroyed. King Grieve is dead—I killed him myself.”Utros showed little surprise. “That saves me the trouble of doing it. Grieve wasunruly and uncontrollable. I would have had to be rid of him sooner or later.”Knowing that people were dying every moment, Nicci snapped, “Enough talk, Utros!I brought you here to end this.”The general glared at her. “It is already ended. I will accept your surrender,but my army will continue to ransack Tanimura. You have lost, Sorceress. YourOld World has lost. There is nothing you can do.”Still in the saddle, Ruva pulled her lips back to expose her teeth. “We musthave Nicci. She needs to die. My sister and I will accept no other terms. She isours!”Ava’s mocking spirit flickered in an invisible wind. “You can rip out her heart,dear sister, and I will rip out her soul.”Utros looked to the twin sorceresses, then back at Nicci, and he smiled withhalf a face. “Agreed. That is our only demand. Your life is forfeit, and if Iwatch you die with enough pain, then I might call off some of my troops. That iswhat true surrender looks like.” He nodded. “Are you a leader, Sorceress? Willyou give your life to save all those people in the city? Choose now!”Bannon crouched in a fighting stance, and Lila stood beside him with her swordraised. Nathan extended his hands, ready to call on his gift.Nicci felt glad for their loyalty, although she didn’t need it. She touched thecoldness in her heart, and her voice came out as hard as black ice. “Youmisunderstand, General. I did not call you here to give my surrender. I came todefeat you. I came to send all of you to the underworld, where you are longoverdue.”The escort troops shifted in their saddles, amused by her bravado. Standing infront of his stallion, Utros cocked his head back. Her comments seemed likebraggadocio, but Nicci was deadly serious. She could feel the bone box in herpocket.General Utros drew his sword and advanced on Nicci, ready to strike her downwhere she stood. Ruva slithered out of her saddle and approached, while the paleremnant of her sister hovered beside her, glowering. Because Nicci’s demeanorwas so completely confident, the twins showed a flicker of uneasiness.Nicci said, “Thanks to Lord Rahl, the only war wizard born in many centuries,the underworld was sealed forever and the veil was made impenetrable. The deadcould no longer return to the world of the living.”“We know this,” Ruva sneered.“You and all of your soldiers should have been dead fifteen centuries ago. Yoursouls have been on the wrong side of the veil for all this time.” Nicci lookedbeyond Utros to the escort soldiers. “When you were petrified, the Keeper didnot know he had lost you, but now you are flesh again . . . and your souls areforfeit.”“We are here,” Ava snapped. “I am with my sister.”From the general’s troubled expression, Nicci could see that her words were nosurprise to him. She said, “You know this in your heart, General Utros. Youshould be long dead.”“My empire is here in this world,” Utros said. “Today we have sent enough soulsto the underworld to satisfy the Keeper.”“But they are not the correct souls. I was once a Sister of the Dark, and I wasallied with the Keeper.” Her expression hardened. “I no longer serve him. He isno friend of mine, but I will happily give him what he is owed.” Her gazetraveled out to the city of Tanimura, where countless ancient soldiers continuedfighting. “All of your souls. Life to the living. Death to the dead.”Utros did not seem amused. “You are arrogant and powerless.”Nicci snatched the bone box from her dress and slid aside the delicate lid,which was now stained with blood from her hand. Inside, the small glowing pearlrotated, shone brighter.Seeing it, the twin sorceresses recoiled. Ava’s spirit shrieked, and Ruva lungedforward, realizing the danger even if she did not understand what the objectwas.Utros raised his sword to kill Nicci, but Bannon and Lila both dove in to drivethe big general back a step. Knowing he had to give Nicci whatever time sheneeded, Nathan shoved with both hands, palms outward. The blast of solidifiedair ripped harmlessly through the spirit of Ava but slammed Ruva backward,disrupting the spell she was trying to work.Nicci had finally realized what Richard’s constructed spell truly was—thatSubtractive Magic, her Subtractive Magic, was the necessary component to unleashthe devastation. Nicci herself was the key, the foundation. Richard had knownshe would figure it out.Life to the living. Death to the dead, written in the language of Creation. Thisspell would heal the frayed threads in the veil. What had once unraveled wouldbe tied up again.She called upon both sides of her gift. Holding the bone box in her palm, shesummoned lightning, and an arcing bolt of pure white energy, braided with anopposite bolt of black Subtractive power, struck the bone box and vaporized itin a blinding flash of pure elemental power. The dual elements twisted togetherand struck the glowing orb, delivering the required element to ignite theinternal protocols of Richard’s constructed spell. The magic began to unfoldaround her and run toward its terminal objective.As Nicci ignited the spell, the backwash levitated her into the air. Glowinglines grew and lengthened, crisscrossing to form a cylinder around her, as if atwo-dimensional spell-form had become three-dimensional in order to be viable insuch an extreme circumstance. With a roaring sound that reverberated across theflat expanse of the island, those patterns of lines, angles, and arcs continuedto grow outward, extending away from the cylindrical spell-form. Lines of lightraced through the air to support triangles and intersections. While orange lightspiraled outward, the lines of power braced complex angles of pure white.Nathan staggered backward, shielding his eyes with the sleeve of his frayedruffled shirt. The lightning bolt had been powerful, but it was no more than awhisper compared to the constructed spell she had just triggered. The magiccontinued to grow.As the lines expanded and branched ever outward, thorns of light sprouted inneedle-sharp points. Their patterns and flow interacted and connected, givingthe entire web of lines their intended purpose—to open the torn veil wide enoughso the Keeper could seize all the long-overdue souls and drag them to where theybelonged.Life to the living. Death to the dead.After Nicci set the constructed spell in motion, the routines continued to growthrough a rhythm of intersections and routes that arced out in all directions.Suspended within the web, lifted off the ground, she felt each new line as ifsome cosmic needle were taking a stitch through her soul to draw the thread oflight out of her and into the fabric of the spell. She experienced profound painand pleasure at the same time.The spell would encompass General Utros and the entire ancient army.*Nathan watched the unfolding, increasing lines of power, knowing that this wasbeyond anything he could do. Richard had created the spell, but Nicci was theengine driving all the destruction. Encased in her web of expanding, invinciblemagic, the beautiful sorceress wheeled in the air.Utros’s escort soldiers screamed and backed away. Their horses reared in panic.Ava and Ruva cried out in challenge and terror, trying to defend against whatNicci had unleashed. The general strained to stagger forward, struggling to lifthis sword so he could kill Nicci, but the weapon seemed as heavy as a mountain.Bannon and Lila were buffeted by the surging power. They tried to stand theirground, holding their swords to defend against powers they could not imagine.Halsband Island shook and shuddered, and the settling rubble underfoot made theground unsteady, while Nicci hung suspended in the air as light showered aroundher.With impossible speed, the dazzling lines spiraled across the landscape androlled past the island, beyond the bridges to the lowtown, then across theharbor. The spell raced like an ill wind through all the districts of the cityto the outlying hills and beyond. Unstoppable, it swept up tens of thousands ofthe invading army. The underworld was now open and ravenous, demanding to havethese souls.Men in ancient armor screamed as the glowing green lines overran them, nettingsome, while impaling others on the thorns of orange light, slicing others withrazor black energy.Tendrils flew out beyond Tanimura, far down the coast, racing across the OldWorld to reclaim all the souls of the ancient army, wherever they had beendispatched. The very line between life and death was at stake, now torn open.As the veil to the underworld tore to allow passage of all those souls, Nathanfelt his heart rip as well. The darkness within him hammered outward,struggling, trying to hold on. He clutched his chest as pain exploded like abattering ram inside him. He had not experienced agony like this sinceFleshmancer Andre had split open his breastbone to pull out his old, weak heart.Now the remnants of Ivan strained and struggled. That evil man’s spiritresisted, but the raging constructed spell demanded every scrap of his taintedsoul as well. Searing green light blazed around Nathan’s eyes, inside his mind,and he used his own gift to push the hated presence out of him.With a last dull saw blade of pain, the poisonous vestige of Ivan slipped out ofhim and fluttered away like scattered raven’s wings. The chief handler’s spiritwas sucked down with all the other screaming souls as the world and theunderworld yawned open.Nathan realized he was at last free.*Green mist swirled like a sudden fog, rising from a world that did not belong tothe living. Across the battlefield in the hills and the city streets, the groundshuddered open. Countless ancient soldiers were yanked screaming into theunderworld, their souls reclaimed, their centuries-old bodies crumbling to dust.From the center of the storm of magic, Nicci realized that elements of the spellpatterns were themselves in the language of Creation, a design that transitionedinto an elemental language that hummed with the rhythm of life itself and alsocalled to the dead.Ava’s shimmering spirit tried to flee, pulling against the invisible claws ofdestiny. Her intangible form stretched and tangled, then was whisked away with afading shriek. Leaping after her dead sister, trying to catch her, Ruvastruggled with the limitations of her physical form. Their connection was toostrong, and the Keeper demanded them both. Ruva’s soul tore away, inexorablyfollowing her twin to the underworld. Empty, her body dropped lifeless,disintegrating into grains of dust and fragments of yellowed bones.Suspended in the air as the magical holocaust continued, Nicci knew that thisspell-form was complex beyond her comprehension. She gazed in awe at the networkof light woven into a fabric of forms around her, motifs and unfathomableemblems. She was not surprised that Richard had been able to conceive suchpower. Caught in her own web and also shielded by it, she watched the very stuffof creation and annihilation.By using the interior perspective of the constructed spell, by being theinitiating element, Nicci was more than an observer, but also a participant. Itwas her very will, her fury, her nature that became an empowering element toannihilate the vast invading force in one stroke. It was Nicci herself who laidwaste to the ancient army and cast them tumbling into the world of the dead.Strong and defiant, General Utros resisted until the last minute, but even thelegendary commander could not withstand the call of the Keeper, the obduratedemands of mortality. As he shuddered and struggled against the pull of theconstructed spell, the gold mask fell off to show his stripped face.Knowing he could not win, Utros raised one gauntleted fist, shouting a finalvow. “Now I can conquer the whole underworld!” His massive body disintegrated ashis spirit vanished into the whirlwind of green mist.As the spell finally wound through to its terminus, its task accomplished, Niccifelt more alive than she had ever been. Embraced by Richard’s spell, she haddealt out death, once again becoming Death’s Mistress. Richard had written themessage for her in the language of Creation on the bone box. In that moment,neither world—the world of the living nor the world of the dead—seemed entirelyreal to her. She was the Grace. She was life. She was death.Only then was Nicci released from her prison of light, exhausted and exhilaratedby the experience. She drifted back to the ground and slumped in the rubble ofthe Palace of the Prophets.More than ever, she ached for Richard. It was bliss to have been held in theembrace of his spell, but now it was gone. That moment of love and protectionevaporated as the last few lines of light went dark."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 85 [part0003.html#a7]The ravaged city reeled as the world itself cracked open. Misty veils rippledthrough the streets as the ancient warriors were swept away to where they shouldhave gone centuries before. With howls of despair louder than the roar ofbattle, the soldiers collapsed in full armor, falling to dust. Tanimura became aliteral city of the dead.The D’Haran fighters, the city militia, the ragtag refugee army, and theeveryday citizens were left amazed as the seemingly hopeless battle simply endedbefore their eyes. The overwhelming enemy was vanquished by an ally no one hadexpected—the Keeper himself.Among his weary and wounded soldiers, General Zimmer stood wrung-out andshuddering. His hand trembled as he gripped the hilt of his sword. For hours hehad lived in a mechanical process of defending himself, cutting down oneopponent after another. They were all faceless to him. Surely he had slain morethan a hundred by his own hand.Lyesse, her bare skin painted red with blood, turned with angry disappointmentat all the opponents who had dropped dead in front of her; she clearly wasn’tfinished getting revenge for Thorn.Sisters Arabella and Mab staggered up to General Zimmer, dragging with everystep. Mab bled from a deep cut in her upper arm and another in her ribs, andArabella held her up. Now that she had a moment when she wasn’t fighting for herlife, Sister Arabella healed her companion’s injuries, strengthening Mab enoughso that she could stand upright again.Oliver, Peretta, and Amber joined them. All the rats they had summoned had fledback into the sewers and grates, gorged with fresh meat and matted with blood,but no one understood why the entire ancient army had just crumbled to dust in ahurricane of inexplicable magic.“What do we do now, General?” Oliver looked around, but none of the others evenspoke questions aloud.At the far side of the blood-strewn square, where so many ancient soldiers hadvanished into death, twenty fierce Norukai stood with their mouths wide,suddenly finding themselves alone and vastly outnumbered. Now that the tableswere turned, they bellowed their defiance and raised their axes, clubs, andswords to keep fighting.Though battered, the D’Haran soldiers were rejuvenated by the sudden reprieve,and their battle cry was ten times as loud as the scarred raiders’. GeneralZimmer led the charge. “Now we clear the streets of Tanimura, wipe out everylast Norukai, and dump their bodies into the sea.”Fueled by the prospect of certain victory, his army ran after the burly raiders,who turned to flee.*Bannon was horrified to watch the underworld open up and reclaim all the lostsouls in a nightmarish storm. In the aftermath, it took him a long moment torealize that the defenders of Tanimura had somehow won.After the astonishing play of lights, forms, and tangled lines, Nicci hadcollapsed in the rubble of the Palace of the Prophets. Nathan squatted next tothe sorceress, cradling her in a tender gesture. “Dear spirits, I don’t knowwhen I’ve ever endured the like. You saved us. You saved us all!”Her voice was ragged. “Not just me. You all helped. I could not have done thiswithout you.” Nicci looked at him, then at Bannon and Lila, nodding ingratitude. “But this was also Richard’s doing. He made that constructed spelland said it was all I needed. Even though I didn’t understand what he meant, Ibelieved him. He had faith in me, and that faith made me stronger than I’ve everbeen before.”An uncomfortable silence settled over Halsband Island and extended throughoutTanimura. Now that General Utros had turned to dust, his gold mask lay facedownon the broken stones. Only a few bits of his horned helmet remained, mostlydecayed, next to bone splinters. Of the escort soldiers, only a few scraps ofmetal, rusted buckles, and broken links of chain mail lay on the ground.Diminished sounds of fighting came from the city as new skirmishes erupted. Withhis sharp vision, Bannon could see knots of Norukai warriors trying to fend offa surge from the overjoyed D’Haran defenders. Lila flashed an eager glance atBannon. “Sounds like the fun isn’t over yet, boy. Would you like to join me? Ifwe run, we might get there before someone else slays them all.”Bannon looked at his ornate sword. The hilt now felt perfect in his hand,entirely his. The edge was notched from the recent fighting, but any goodswordsmith could restore its razor edge. “I do want to see all the Norukai dead,but sweet Sea Mother, I have done enough killing for today.”In the main city, the vengeful militia members, Tanimuran city guards, andD’Haran soldiers surrounded the last Norukai. A few raiders managed to get backto two of the grounded serpent ships and shoved off into the harbor, but theyfound no safety in the water either. The ships of the Tanimuran navy as well asthe reinforcements from Serrimundi still remained to fight them. A rain of firearrows dropped down on the serpent ships before they could get out of theharbor. Before long every last raider vessel was engulfed in flames and burnedto the waterline.A short while later, General Linden rode to Halsband Island with a handful ofsoldiers, followed by several Hidden People in bloodstained gray cloaks. Zimmerfollowed soon after with his own bedraggled escort. “We are mopping upthroughout the city,” Zimmer said.Linden added, “By standing together, we might have withstood the Norukai, but wehad no chance against the army of General Utros.” He shook his head, looked atthe dust and bone fragments scattered amid the rubble, the trivial remnants ofso many ancient soldiers. “I can’t believe it.”Nicci said, “With Richard’s help I found a power even greater than an invinciblearmy—the power of life and death.”Life to the living. Death to the dead.“The power of destiny,” Nathan said, raising his eyebrows. “Never forget thatshe was indeed Death’s Mistress.”More Sisters of the Light made their way to Halsband Island, their former home.During the battles in the city, Sisters Sharon, Lucia, and Heather had beenslain, and now the remaining Sisters marked their passing. Sisters Rhoda,Eldine, Mab, and Arabella greeted Nicci and Nathan, relieved. “It seems fittingthat the last battle took place on the very foundations of the Palace of theProphets,” Rhoda said.“So much magic was entwined through the structure of that building, maybe someof it remained,” Arabella said.“I am glad the palace is no more,” Nathan said with sniff. “It no longer had apurpose.”Nicci said, “With prophecy gone and gifted young men no longer suffering, yourentire order has no purpose.”“Prelate Verna wrestled with the same question,” said Eldine. “She tried to finda new reason because our old ways were gone. By helping at Cliffwall, theSisters worked to understand and guide the use of magical lore.”“But now Cliffwall is also gone,” Mab said, “buried in stone.”Nathan mused, “The world still has many central sites filled with mysterious anddangerous books. Those archives have to be tended and watched—and protected.That could be your order’s new purpose.”The Sisters looked at one another. Amber kicked a few broken pebbles at herfeet. “We came to Tanimura because this is where the Palace of the Prophets was.That is why I joined the order in the first place. I want to do somethingsignificant. I need some important task. Prelate Verna told me not to give uphope. My parents are already proud of my brother, and they’ll be even happierafter they learn how brave Norcross was today, how many Norukai ships hefought.” She sighed. “I wanted to be important too.”“You will be,” said Sister Mab. “We’ll rebuild our order. Without the prelate,we have traveled together and fought together as equals, but as Sisters of theLight we must have a new leader. Who will be our prelate?”Eldine looked at Mab, and Mab looked at Arabella, then slowly all of them turnedto Nicci. “You were once a Sister of the Light,” said Rhoda. “You betrayed us bybecoming a Sister of the Dark, but we know you have come back to the sacredcause. You are stronger now than ever, stronger than any of us.”Mab said, “Stronger than any Sister of the Light that ever existed, strongerthan any prelate we have had before.” Her eyes shone. “Working together with allthe resources of Tanimura, we could rebuild the Palace of the Prophets!” Shelooked up to the skies as she imagined towers there.Nicci scowled. “I’m no longer a Sister of the Dark, that is true, but neither amI a Sister of the Light. I am Nicci, a sorceress, companion to Lord RichardRahl. He gave me a mission for the D’Haran Empire, and I do not intend to besidetracked.”Nathan felt more disturbed. “If you mean to rebuild the palace, if you raiseeven one foundation stone on top of another, I want nothing to do with that.” Heshuddered. “I have things to accomplish in my life.”Nicci actually smiled at him. “We all do.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 86 [part0003.html#a7]The survivors of Tanimura spent the next two days extinguishing fires andkilling the last of the enemies. They tracked down the Norukai stragglers, whoproved to be cowards after all when they fought alone. Knowing they were hunted,they crawled into storage buildings and fishing shacks; some even hid under thedamaged piers, holding on to pilings in the water and trying to remain unseen.When the cornered raiders were discovered, angry city people used harpoons andboat hooks to impale them in the water. Nicci didn’t consider it torture, merelyjustice.Leaving Halsband Island, she and Nathan reunited with many other gifted men andwomen from Tanimura. Together they used their magic to douse fires with rainthey squeezed out of the air. Many of the larger buildings, including twentynoble villas in the hill district, had been burned down to skeletons.And there were thousands of wounded to be tended. Volunteers from Tanimura, aswell as earnest refugees from Effren and Renda Bay, formed triage teams. Themerchants of the garment district boiled fabric and tore it into strips to makebandages. Oliver and Peretta, along with Scholar-Archivist Franklin, ChiefMemmer Gloria, and their Cliffwall followers, used the knowledge they hadlearned in the archive. They called upon any scraps of the gift they could useto help heal the wounded, saving thousands of lives.While Bannon had only rudimentary first-aid training, the morazeth had a greatdeal of experience in tending combat wounds, even amputations. Lila knelt besidea man whose hand had been chopped off by a Norukai axe. His bleeding had clottedin the hours since he had fallen, but he was weak and sickened. Lila cleaned thestump and wrapped it in a damp bandage, gritting her teeth as she pulled theknot tight.“That will keep him alive for now,” she said to Bannon. “We’ll need the healersand herb women to make vats of salve, or else the wounds will get infected, andmore will die in the coming weeks.”The victim groaned, “My hand! How can I do anything without my hand?”Lila spoke more to Bannon than to the moaning patient. “A warrior usually dieswhen he falls in the combat arena, but we remember the story of a champion namedKalef, a slave brought from afar, who reigned in the arena until an opponenthacked off his hand at the wrist. Even as he bled, Kalef kept fighting until hecollapsed to his knees, but still he wouldn’t yield. Normally, the challengerwould strike a death blow and become the new champion, but the crowd was soenthusiastic that Kalef was allowed to live. Healers nursed him back to health,and when he regained his strength, he returned to the arena with a modifiedsword, fighting with a blade screwed directly onto his wrist. He killed his nextopponent and became champion again.”Now, Lila looked down at the wounded man who stared in shock at the bloodybandages around his wrist. “That one will never be a champion, but he will learnto be useful. There is much work to do in Tanimura.”Though tending to the injured was the first priority, the numerous corpses alsohad to be dealt with. Every one of General Utros’s soldiers had disintegrated,but more than ten thousand other people had died in the fighting, and theirbodies were strewn along the streets and piled in the market squares where theyhad made their last stands.After several days in the hot and humid Tanimura air, the bloated corpses beganto stink. Seagulls swarmed over the city, feasting on any cadavers they found,pecking out the eyes and flying off when the body-handling teams shooed themaway. Out in the harbor, larger flocks of the birds landed on the floating dead.Predatory fish picked the bones clean.Generals Zimmer and Linden assigned soldiers to mortuary detail. Porters who hadpreviously worked at the docks now loaded their carts with bodies and draggedthem out of the city. The desolate expanse of Halsband Island became the perfectsite for enormous funeral pyres that burned constantly, fed with wood andcorpses.Plumes of greasy black smoke hung like a pall in the air, and the smell ofroasting meat was so pervasive that no one had much of an appetite. Even butchershops closed their doors, because they had no business. The funeral pyrescreated a layer of ash over the ruins of the Palace of the Prophets, which wouldbecome a new foundation of soil. One day, the island might come alive again.While all of the slain D’Haran soldiers, militia members, and innocent citizensdeserved to be burned in the cleansing pyres, no dead Norukai would receive thathonor. During the cleanup, when the body handlers gathered the bodies, theraider corpses were separated out and dealt with last. Wearing looks of disgust,D’Haran soldiers hauled carts piled with dead Norukai wearing sharkskin armor,metal adornments, spikes implanted in their skulls or shoulders. By now, all thebodies showed signs of decay, their skin discolored, the flesh swollen. Theylooked even uglier than usual.Captain Jared reluctantly offered the Chaser as a corpse ship, piling his deckwith the hideous raiders. Nicci and Zimmer watched as soldiers pushed stinkingcartloads along the pier, and even the krakeners held their noses in disgust asthey lifted the bodies aboard.The Chaser made repeated trips, sailing out beyond the edge of the harbor to thedeep water, where Jared and his crew threw the dead Norukai overboard, one bodyat a time. Some sank, some bobbed. They would all drift away in the currents tobe eaten by fishes and erased from memory.Jared had even reported, with a shiver and a thrill, that on his last run, whenthe sharks feasted on all the bodies, the circling triangular fins hadscattered. Among the Norukai corpses, other figures surfaced, selka reveling inthe abundance of dead enemies. They tore at the meaty flesh as if they couldn’tcontain their malicious joy. The krakener crew had stared, horrified, but notfrightened. The selka looked up at them with slitted eyes, but made no move toattack. They satisfied themselves with the Norukai corpses and swam away.Captain Jared’s once-cocky outlook had been replaced with a sad shadow, andbeard stubble covered his cleft chin. As he took on another load for disposal,he crossed his arms over his chest and looked at Nicci, who had come to see himon the docks. “It’s loathsome work, Sorceress, but nobody else would do it,” hescoffed. “Once again my krakeners prove their worth.”Nicci said, “Your ship smelled foul before, but this is intolerable.”“Oh, I will tolerate it, Sorceress, though this is fouler cargo than anytentacled beast. I can’t wait to dump the last of these bodies.” Jaredbrightened. “My crews are eager to hunt krakens again. We’ll bring backdelicious meat to feed this city while it recovers.”“Thank you, Captain,” said Zimmer, but without enthusiasm.As Tanimura made plans to rebuild, they were only one city of many that had beendamaged in the war. As the survivors of Renda Bay, Effren, and other devastatedtowns helped clear the burned-down warehouses, sawmill operators cut freshlumber, and armies of carpenters worked to restore the city. Bricklayers formedfoundations, clay handlers added stucco to walls, whitewashers used buckets oflime to finish the new structures.Thaddeus and Rendell, who had become fast friends after saving each other’slives more than once, worked to erect new homes and shops at the waterfront.Thaddeus said, “Now that we no longer have to worry about the Norukai, someday Iwould like to take my people back to Renda Bay and rebuild our own town.”“I will go with you.” Rendell had sad eyes, but he managed a smile. “My Ildakarwill never return, and I want a fresh start. I liked Renda Bay.”“There’s still a great deal of work ahead of us,” Thaddeus said, “but we’ll haveour freedom and our homes.”Hearing them, Nicci stepped closer. “You will determine your own destiny, yourown rule. You’ll be responsible for your actions, but you also have a strongconscience. Then you’ll truly be a part of the D’Haran Empire.”Four of the Hidden People, moving quietly in the daylight that was still ablessing to them, came to Nicci, looking concerned and lost. Free of theirancient responsibilities, they had trekked across the land so they could fightfor Nicci, but now they didn’t know what to do, since all the battles were endedand they were far from home.“The bustle of this city confounds us,” said one man with deep lines of concernon his pale face. “Nearly six hundred of us still survive. General Utros isdefeated, but what will become of Orogang? That city is still our home.”“And it is quiet!” said another man.“Then make it your home,” Nicci said. “Go back there and live in the sunlight.By now, the zhiss are all dead. You no longer need to hide in the shadows. Smashopen all the bricked-up windows, let in the air. Orogang can become a grandcapital again.”“But we will be all alone,” said a woman, tugging on her gray hood.“Not for long. Traders will come to Orogang. You will be one of the key citiesin the mountains.” Nicci smiled. “And I’ll make certain Lord Rahl knows aboutyou. He may even set up a satellite capital in Orogang. Would you like that?”The Hidden People beamed, and it seemed as if light had returned to theirfeatures. It was just one more of the many pieces coming together after thedefeat of General Utros and the Norukai scourge.As the most urgent tasks were completed in the aftermath of the war, therefugees began to reassess their future. Scholar-Archivist Franklin, along withhis rival and companion Gloria, gathered with the Sisters of the Light.“Cliffwall is destroyed, and all those books are lost. We have to re-create themas best we can.”Gloria tapped a finger to her temple. “They are not lost if my memmers stillknow them. We can reproduce thousands of volumes, but it will take time.”Because funeral pyres still covered Halsband Island, the Sisters had taken upresidence in an empty inn whose owners had been killed in the attack. There inthe common room, at long tables once used for boisterous crowds with tankards ofale, the scholars sat beside volunteer scribes. They used stacks of paper,ledger books from the harbormaster’s offices, any scrap that could capturewords. The memmers sat back with their eyes half closed, muttering line afterline as they recited the books preserved in their gifted memories.The Cliffwall scholars had devoted their lives to learning, to poring over everyword in those ancient books, and now they participated in writing them down. Byday, they wrote in sunlit rooms, and at night they lit lanterns to continuescribing. The memmers’ voices grew hoarse as they dictated, but they didn’tstop. It would take many years to recapture most of the lost knowledge, but theywould keep remembering and keep writing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 87 [part0003.html#a7]After a brief squall the night before, the Tanimura harbor smelled of clean saltair rather than death, blood, and decay. Nathan inhaled deeply as he sat at theend of the dock and looked down at the last page in his life book, consideringhow he would wrap up his story.A gray splat struck the boards beside him, and a seagull spun overhead with ashriek that sounded like mocking laughter. Nathan glanced up with an annoyedsnort. “I could blast you out of the sky with a tiny ball of fire, you miserablebird.” The gull was not intimidated by the threat and flew away under the brightblue sky.Out in the harbor, most of the wrecked ships had been dismantled to clearpassage for trade. Two large cargo ships remained sunk in the shallows, theirhulls tilted underwater, masts protruding like drowned trees. The people ofTanimura would leave those hulks as a memorial, so that anyone who came to thecity would be reminded of the battle.Nathan had nearly filled the life book with adventures, and that fact gave himpause, even stymied his creative efforts. If he’d had plenty of pages left, thewords would flow. He would have described every thought, every setback, everyvictory. How could he sum up so many grand events on the single remaining page?He considered simply purchasing another blank book so he could keep writing, butthis precious volume wasn’t just a book from a stationer. This was his lifebook, given to him by the witch woman Red, in the Dark Lands. The first volumehad been written in ink made of his own burned blood, chronicling the first partof his life. He had filled this second book by his own hand, but theleather-bound volume was a special gift nonetheless.With his boots dangling over the end of the dock, he reread the last pages hehad written the night before while he sat on the barracks steps in the Tanimuragarrison. Nathan knew he would need to find finer rooms eventually, provided heand Nicci remained here in the city. He already felt restless.He looked down at his descriptions of the wizards of Ildakar, Mirrormask and theslave uprising, the awakening of the enormous stone army. His eyes stung when heread about dear Elsa, her transference magic, and how she had died. His briefworkmanlike lines were sadly inadequate, not because he meant to give her shortshrift, but because he didn’t have the heart to write what Elsa deserved.He had tried to do better chronicling the end of Prelate Verna and thedestruction of Cliffwall. His descriptions of the final battles in Tanimura weremerely vignettes, but he simply didn’t have the room. Each event deserved a fullchapter of its own, if not an entire volume. Still, what he wrote was the truth,and that was what mattered most.Knowing the importance of his work, he forced himself to keep writing, to finishthe job in the paper he had available. With tiny letters and succinct prose, headdressed the brave sacrifices of so many soldiers, Bannon’s victory over KingGrieve, and the cataclysmic end of Utros’s ancient army when the underworldreclaimed them.He had so much more to say, but he reached the bottom of the last page. Hisfinal lines were cramped and dense, and when there was no more room he simplywrote, “And thus was the Old World saved.”The dock boards creaked with approaching footsteps, and he turned to see Nicciwalking toward him in her black dress. The big sand panther padded along besideher, her tan fur clean and brushed, as if she were no more than a contented,groomed pet. Nicci stopped beside him at the end of the pier. “If this is howyou spend your days, Wizard, you will grow fat and lazy.”A seagull flew overhead, scolding Mrra. The panther roared, and the bird flewaway.“It is a well-deserved rest.” Nathan looked down at the last page. “Writing anobjective and thorough chronicle is a different kind of battle, but just ashard. I’m afraid I didn’t have enough paper.” He closed the book.Nicci’s lips tightened in a smile. “I’m certain you found room to include yourown exploits.”“Oh, not all of them. Dear spirits, that would take an entire library.”She didn’t react to his humor. “When you tell your stories in taverns andbanquets, I’m sure you will provide excruciating detail.”“I am wounded by your attitude.” Placing a palm to his chest, Nathan felt thelumpy scar and his steady heartbeat, and realized that it truly did feel likehis heart after all. The heart of a wizard.Mrra let out a low growl and turned back toward the shore, her tail thrashing.Nicci spun, suddenly wary.An unexpected form stepped out onto the pier, a slender woman in a gray shiftthat clung tightly to her body. Her skin was pale, her face gaunt to the pointof being cadaverous. Her scalp was a tangle of red locks like ropy twistedsnakes, and she smiled at them with unnatural black lips. She strolled forward,ominous, confident as if no one else existed except for the three of them. Ather side walked a strange creature with spotted russet fur, pointed ears, and along muzzle—not a cat, not a wolf, but some other species entirely. Mrrabristled and prepared to protect her sister panther.Nathan felt a chill. “Dear spirits! It’s Red.”The witch woman glided up to them. Nathan couldn’t imagine how she had passedthrough the hills and the entire city of Tanimura without causing an uproar. Heclimbed to his feet and stood at the end of the dock, still clutching the lifebook.Nicci was instantly defensive. “I had hoped never to see you again.”The witch woman’s laughter was a musical sound, but not music Nathan wanted tohear. “Our hopes are not always rewarded.” She cast an offhand glance back atthe city. “That battle left enough skulls and bodies to properly decorateTanimura. It’s a shame you feel the need to clean them all up.” Red’s forestedhills and the sheltered glen of her cottage were strewn with the bones of thosewho had died when they came to seek the witch woman’s services.“It was only as much death as we needed to assure victory,” Nicci said.Hunter, the strange russet animal at her side, sat on his haunches and stared atMrra, eye-to-eye. The sand panther’s whiskers twitched.Red turned to Nathan, as if she expected him to know why she had come. “You havesomething for me.” It was not a question. “I doubted you would return to theDark Lands and deliver your life book to me, so I came in person. You shouldhave known that’s what I expected.” Her black lips formed a smile.Nathan was surprised. “I only finished writing no more than a few minutes ago.How did you know?”“I’m a witch woman. I foresee things. You read the first lines in your book.”Nathan turned to the words that had been inscribed there even before Red gavethe book to him:Future and Fate depend on both the journey and the destination. Kol Adair liesfar to the south in the Old World. From there, the Wizard will behold what heneeds to make himself whole again. And the Sorceress must save the world.He sniffed. “Those words drove us across the Old World and guided me where Ineeded to go. You did indeed set many things in motion by writing that.” Hepursed his lips. “Prophecy is not usually so clear and direct.”Red let out a full-throated laugh. “Nathan Rahl, you know better than anyone!That was no prophecy, no premonition. It was just an idea, and you followed ithowever you wished, interpreted the words the way you wanted. You set your ownevents in motion.” She extended her hands, waiting for him to hand her the book.“I can’t wait to read the entire chronicle.”Nathan reeled from what she had just said. He had followed those words on aquest to restore his gift. Because of what Red had written, he, Nicci, andBannon had traveled over Kol Adair and all the way to Ildakar. Those words haddriven them so far, but had he just been chasing a mirage?No, not a mirage, he realized. His own destiny. As a former prophet, Nathan Rahlknew that people would do what they were meant to do, no matter what words werewritten. He had made his own fate.Red’s furry companion sniffed Mrra. Both animals remained ready to pounce, butNicci and the witch woman kept them under control.When Nathan surrendered the life book to her, he felt a profound sense of loss,as if a part of his story had ended. Did this mean his adventures were over now?That he would just retire in Tanimura? He certainly didn’t intend to do that.A moment later Red produced another book, though he had not noticed her carryinganything. She held out a fresh volume bound in pale doeskin. He accepted it inwonder and opened it to find the volume full of blank pages.The witch woman said, “It took you a thousand years to fill the first book andbarely a year for the second. I wonder when you will make me come back andretrieve this volume. That is up to you.”Without further farewell, Red walked back down the creaking dock with her shaggypet following. Nathan ran his thumb along the smooth leather of his new lifebook and pressed it close to his chest.*At the edge of the thick Hagen Woods, the pines and oaks created dense shadows.Nicci could still smell blood from the recent battle. This place carried so muchdark history, but now it was nothing more than a normal forest. The hush thathad hung over the tangled branches was replaced by birdsong.Mrra peered into the forest with golden eyes. The underbrush rustled, andmuscular feline forms glided toward them, the survivors of the sand pantherpride that Mrra had led overland to fight against General Utros.Nicci stroked Mrra’s head, scratched behind her ears, and the panther purredcontentedly. Her pelt was covered with branded symbols from Ildakar, but Mrrawas the only member of her new pride to bear such markings. The other big catshad roamed the wild all their lives, and Nicci knew that was what she wanted.Mrra twitched her tail and stared into the forest, but she refused to leave hersister panther. Nicci wrapped her arms around Mrra’s neck, pulling the catclose. She held tight and stroked her fur for a long moment. “Thank you, myloyal companion. Run with your pride. You deserve it.”Mrra let out a rumble in her chest, and Nicci felt the vibrations against hercheek as she held more tightly. “Our spell bond will never be broken. I willalways be your sister panther.” She felt a thickening in her throat as sheswallowed hard and continued. “But this is your pride. Roam the world with them,live your life, hunt, find a mate, have cubs of your own . . . and be free. Thatis all I ask of you. I will let you know if ever I need your help. Thank you forthe new sisters and brothers you have shared with me.” Mrra looked up withgolden feline eyes, and Nicci stroked the cat’s head again. “Go!”Mrra let out a roar and turned to the other cats waiting in the forest. Shebounded into the tree shadows until Nicci could no longer see her, but she wouldalways feel the sand panther in her heart."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 88 [part0003.html#a7]The sword’s edge had been sharpened to a thin steel razor, erasing the nicks andnotches from all the blows Bannon had struck during the fight.“Good as new,” said Mandon, the swordsmith. “After you’ve killed a hundred moreenemies, come back to me and I’ll fix it again.”Bannon was pleased with the ornate blade and doubly pleased to know that theswordsmith remembered selling him Sturdy, so long ago. “That was my first swordand a good one. I wish I still had it.” Pushing back the sadness in his voice,he turned Nathan’s fine weapon from side to side, watching how sunlight flowedlike liquid down the polished steel. “But this one will do.”Mandon chuckled. “I still have that chopping post in the back if you’d like totest it.”Bannon remembered when he had first purchased Sturdy. So full of the pain andtragedy that he hid every day, he had hacked the post to splinters. Now, he wasmuch more controlled. Not only was he a better swordsman, but his inner hurtswere hardened and healed. His optimism was more than a false façade—it was areal part of him.The other swords in the smith’s shop had been picked over for the defense ofTanimura, and many notched and bloody weapons had been retrieved from thestreets, pried from dead hands. Mandon would have years of work cleaning andresharpening them all.Bannon sheathed his sword with a satisfying click in the scabbard. “It’s justfine as it is. I don’t need to hack at a wooden post.” He paused to smile. “Iprefer opponents who fight back, but I think we’ve done away with all of themfor now.” He added cryptically, “The sword cleaves the bone.”“I’ll fight you, boy, if that’s what you want.” He turned to see Lila standingoutside the shop, clad in her scant black leather. Though they had been loversmany times, she still intimidated him in certain ways. It was another sort ofbattle that Lila intended to win, but it was one he did enjoy. Bannon liked tothink he had softened her as much as a morazeth could be softened.“I don’t need any swordplay for today,” Bannon said to her. “But I’d be happyfor your company otherwise.”“Good. I came to retrieve you.” She crossed her arms over her chest. “Thekraken-hunter captain asked for you. He says he knows what you want.”“Captain Jared?” He frowned, puzzled. “What is it he thinks I want?”Lila gave him an impatient sniff. “You made it quite clear that you wish toleave Tanimura.” She seemed disappointed in him.He remained curious. “Then let’s go talk with him and see what he has to say.”Down by the docks, crew members loaded crates of supplies on board the Chaser.From the foredeck, Jared directed the workers in a loud voice to emphasize thathe was in charge, but they ignored him and did what they already knew how to do.Jared saw them approach along the dock and waved. “I thought you’d come running,Bannon Farmer! This is your chance. The Chaser sails out with the evening tideif you want to go along. We’re heading to Chiriya Island.”“Chiriya Island? Back home?” He hesitated, uncertain. “I haven’t entirely madeup my mind yet.” He looked at Lila.“Yes, you have,” she said, with frown lines appearing on her brow. “Though I’msurprised you’d want to go back to that island. You’ve had few kind words to sayabout it.”With a bright flush, Bannon looked down at his boots. “I have no kind things tosay about my horrible father, and he is dead. I couldn’t save my mother, and shewas what anchored me there. My friend Ian was gone, so I had no reason to stay.But now I am a much braver man, and I realize that there’s also nothing to fearabout going home.” After so much death and mayhem, after all he had been throughwith the Norukai slavers, the selka attack, and the defeat of the ancient army,he was weary to the bone, and in his heart he just wanted some peace. “I don’tknow what that place holds for me anymore. I’m not convinced I’ve any reason togo back.”Jared crossed his arms over his chest and he called down to them. “I’ve just haddisturbing word, too—enough to make me reconsider the destination, if you didn’twant to go there so badly.”“Wait, I never said—” Bannon spluttered, then paused. “What disturbing word? Hassomething happened to Chiriya Island?”The krakener captain grimaced. “More Norukai ships seen in the vicinity.” Hepaused only a moment for the news to sink in. “We broke the back of KingGrieve’s fleet, that’s for sure, but there are more serpent ships plying theseas. Raiders with their own mind for destruction. And now that we’ve conqueredand strengthened the major coastal cities, they’ll be forced to attack softeroutlying targets. Like Chiriya Island.”“Then we have to go there!” Bannon said. “Somebody has to help protect them.They don’t know how to fight. How will they—?” He looked at Lila. “You and I canshow them.”She still seemed to hold a grudge. “I thought you were trying to get away fromme, since you wanted to leave so badly.”He was shocked. “I never said that. I . . . Sweet Sea Mother, I never thought itthrough! I contemplated going home, just as a daydream. I was just thinking ofthose poor villagers. Even with all my bad memories of Chiriya, there are stilla lot of good people who don’t deserve to be slaughtered by the Norukai.”“You didn’t even know about the new Norukai threat until just now.” Lilasniffed. “That wasn’t part of your decision.”Jared grinned at them from the side of the ship, showing the gap in his teeth.“She’s got you there, lad.” After two of his crew members trudged up thegangplank, each with a keg of ale balanced on his shoulder, Jared bounded downto meet them on the docks.“Wait . . .” Bannon hesitated again, his thoughts whirling. “Would it bother youif I go somewhere? You sound hurt.”Lila stiffened. “You have seen me fight. It takes much more than that to hurt amorazeth. And would you not want me at your side if it comes to fighting moreNorukai? Although why you would bother to help such weaklings instead of gettingyour revenge is beyond me.”He squared his shoulders. “Because that island is full of people just like Iwas, and I didn’t deserve what happened to me. People just like Ian, and hedidn’t deserve it. I want to save them, if I can. I, uh, assumed you would gowith me.”“You did not think to ask?”“Would you go with me to Chiriya Island? And wherever else I might go?”She nodded. “I accept your reasons. I will accompany you.” Lila adjusted herblack leather skirt. “You always manage to find circumstances in which you needprotection. I don’t dare let you go alone.”*Though Nicci tried not to show any emotion, saying farewell to Bannon turned outto be more difficult than she expected. As they stood in the large square abovethe harbor, the young man came forward and hugged her for a long moment, muchlonger than was necessary, and she allowed it. She even embraced him back.“I will miss you, Nicci. I’ve grown much in strength and wisdom during my timewith you.” When he finally let go, Bannon turned to Nathan.The wizard clearly felt proud of his protégé. Tears welled in his azure eyes.“My boy, you are a brave fighter and a fine companion. You were naive andgullible when we first met, but now you are a man, stronger, braver, and moreaccomplished than I ever expected.”“I admit, I am impressed,” Nicci said. “When I saved you from your own stupidityin that Tanimura alley, I was certain you were a lost cause. You created yourown problems, and I vowed never to rescue you again.”Bannon’s voice quavered with emotion. “I didn’t need any more rescuing, did I?”“Yes, you did,” Nicci said with a laugh, “but no more than all of us did. Youfought beside us, and we fought beside you. Go home, Bannon Farmer. You deserveit.”Nathan looked closely at Lila. “You swear to protect him? As a morazeth?”“Always. You should not need to ask.”Offended, Bannon touched the sword Nathan had given him. “I thought you said Icould take care of myself!”Nicci and Nathan looked at each other with an amused expression.Lila repeated, “You have nothing to worry about. I’ve already given my word.”They lingered for a long moment as the sun set, then Bannon and Lila made theirway down to the kraken ship that was ready to depart.Nicci turned back to look at the streets of Tanimura and around the harbor. Theflat expanse of Halsband Island was still blackened with the ashes of funeralpyres, but the flames had finally gone out, and the brisk ocean winds hadscoured the air clean of the stink of death.Now that they stood together in the square, Nathan asked her, “So, what is tobecome of us? Are you also going to rest on the knowledge that the world issafe, thanks to us?”“The world is never safe. And our promise to Richard is never over.” Her browfurrowed with concern. “We know he is embroiled in a great crisis of his own upin D’Hara. If the danger is so great that he could not spare troops when Iasked, then perhaps we should return to the People’s Palace and help him.”Nathan’s lips quirked in a small smile. “I knew dear Richard couldn’t survivewithout us for long. You think we should ride north, off to the rescue?”“I believe he needs us.” She wanted nothing more than to fight at Richard’s sideagain, to see his handsome face, feel his presence. But she had left D’Hara fora reason, knowing that his heart belonged entirely and unconditionally toKahlan. Nicci accepted that, so she had gone far away to keep serving him, butat a safe distance where the ache in her heart would gradually fade.Wrestling with her decision, she looked around the square, felt the weight ofall that had occurred here. Though the people in Tanimura were battered andemotionally drained, they knew they had won, and victory gave a brightness totheir mood.The messenger who rode into the main square from Altur’Rang, however, had a hardand twisted look on his face, flinty eyes, and a sneer that was haughty andsuperior. He raised his voice and demanded the attention of the crowd as theyfinished their work for the day. “I bring word from the new capital of ourrestored empire!”Nicci was instantly alert. “New empire?”The man looked down from his horse and gave them a withering look, as if theywere beneath his notice. He adjusted his helmet. “Your ignorance does notdiminish the glory of Emperor Argus. Altur’Rang has been under attack by anancient army, and yet I bring word to you that the foolish enemy warriors havebeen vanquished.”Nathan stepped closer. “Dear spirits! Was it the army of General Utros?”“An expeditionary force of thousands of armed men,” said the messenger as othersgathered around. “But they were doomed to failure once they encountered themight of Emperor Argus. We offered them the chance to swear allegiance to theNew Imperial Order, but they declined.” His lips twisted in a smile. “Ourfearless troops would have massacred them, but the Keeper himself intervened.The ground opened up and their souls were swept away to the underworld.”Nicci stepped forward to face him. “The Imperial Order is destroyed, and EmperorJagang is dead.” She didn’t add that she herself had assassinated the horribleman.“Emperor Jagang was no longer relevant,” said the messenger. “The Imperial Orderhas returned under a new and stronger man, a ruler who would make Jagang quiverwith awe.”Nicci couldn’t imagine that anything would make Jagang quiver, but she merelyassessed the arrogant messenger. She knew his type. She glanced at Nathan, whoseeyes were wide and whose face was drawn.“Dear spirits, a new Imperial Order?” he whispered.Nicci knew what they had to do. “I had thought our duty was to go and assistRichard, but just as he was confident we could handle this war ourselves, wemust be confident that Richard can deal with his own crisis.” She narrowed hereyes. “If there is a New Imperial Order, if there is a man who claims Jagang’sthrone, then you and I have to go see this Emperor Argus ourselves.”“Indeed we do,” Nathan said, his face flushed with anger. “Indeed we do.”Nicci raised her voice to the messenger. “We will accompany you to Altur’Rang.We would meet this Emperor Argus.”The man turned to them, assessing them. High in the saddle, he ran his eyes upand down Nicci’s body, her blue eyes, her blond hair. She hoped she wouldn’thave to kill him before they reached the grand capital city. “I cannot guaranteehe will see you. Argus is an important man.”“I’m sure he is,” Nathan said.The messenger nudged his horse forward, slowly leaving them behind as he rodethrough the square to continue spreading his news. He called over his shoulder,“I will depart in the morning. You may follow me, but I will not pamper you.”Nathan chuckled. “Oh, young man, we do not need pampering.”Nicci’s expression tightened. She felt hardened inside and knew that her workhere in the Old World was not done. Richard had dispatched her and Nathan tospread the word of the D’Haran Empire, to let the world know that tyrants anddespots and slavery would no longer be tolerated. Richard counted on her tocrush them before they became too great a threat.“We still have work to do, Nathan,” she told him. “And you have a whole new lifebook to fill.”He nodded. “You are indeed correct, Sorceress.” They watched the haughtymessenger depart, already making their plans. “We should prepare for anotherjourney.”“And another fight.”The wizard hesitated as he looked down to the harbor. They could see thekrakener ship setting sails, ready to drift out to sea with the evening tide. “Iplanned ahead, my dear Sorceress.” He reached into the vest that covered hisruffled shirt and pulled out a folded sheaf of papers. “I wrote a lengthy letterto Richard, and General Zimmer promised to dispatch a courier to ride north anddeliver it to the People’s Palace. It tells Richard everything he needs to knowabout what we’ve been up to.” He arched his eyebrows. “Would you like to readit?”Nicci accepted the letter, along with a lead stylus in case she needed to makenotes. She skimmed the pages of stories that Nathan had written about theiradventures, expecting that he would make himself into a legendary hero whileportraying Nicci and Bannon as his faithful companions. Instead, she wassurprised to see that the focus was on her own actions, making Nicci out to bethe savior of the Old World.Nicci handed the letter back to him. “It seems adequate. Remember, I came withyou in the first place because Richard was sure you needed watching.”Nathan made a noncommittal sound as he scribbled a note at the very end beforesealing the letter packet.“What was that?” Nicci asked.“A mere postscript to reassure Richard.”“Reassure him in what way?”He tucked the letter back into his vest. “Merely a promise that I will keepwatch over you, because no matter what you think, you still needwatching . . . with or without the New Imperial Order. You can’t save the worldon your own.”“I am not alone,” Nicci said, and realized it was true. The idea was suddenlystrange to her, given her past, her time under the thumb of her stern mother,serving the Keeper as a Sister of the Dark or crusading for the Imperial Order.All of that was behind her forever. Nicci was stronger, better, braver. Thosewho wished to harm the world didn’t have a chance.She looked at Nathan, then drew her gaze across the bustling city of Tanimura,the forested hills, and the entire Old World beyond. She had no idea what sortof threat Emperor Argus or the New Imperial Order would pose, but she—they—woulddeal with it, no matter what.“No,” she repeated, “I am not alone.”"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR [part0003.html#a7]img1.jpg [../images/00008.jpeg]Terry Goodkind is a #1 New York Times bestselling author.
