I PREFACE The reading of this book would be a dlsappointing experience lor anyone who expects easy Instruction In the art oflovlng . This book. on the contrary. wants to show that love Is not a sentiment which can be easily indulged in by anyone . regardless 01 the level 01 matur- ity reached by him. It wants to convince the reader that all his attempts for love are bound to fail. unless he tries most actively to develop his total personality. so as to achieve a productive orienta- tion; that satisfaction in individual love cannot be attained without the capacity to love one's neighbour. without true humility • courage. laith and discipline. In a culture in which these qualities are rare. the attainment of the capacity to love must remain a rare achievement. Or - anyone can ask himself how many truly loving persons be has known. Yet. the difficulty of the task must not be a reason to abstain from trying to know the difficulties as well as the conditions for Its achievement. To avoid unnecessary compUeations I have tried to deal with the problem in a language which is non-technical as far as this Is possible . For the same reason I have also kept to a mini- mum references to the literature on love. For another problem I did not lind a completely satisfactory solu- tion : that. namely . 01 avoiding the repetition of Ideas expressed In previous books of mine.

E.F. CD IS LOVE AN ART? ~:: Is love an art? Then it requires knowledge and effort. Or is love a pleasant sensation . which to experience is a matter of chance. something one 'falls into' if one is lucky? This little book is based 00 the former premise. while undoubtedly the majority of people today believe in the latter. Not that people think that love is not important. They are starved for it: they watch endless numbers offilms about happy and unhap- py love stories . they listen to hundreds of trashy songs about love - yet hardly anyone thinks that there is anything that needs to be learned about love. This peculiar attitude is based on ... veral premises which either singly or combined tend to uphold it. Most people see the problem of love primarily as that of being loved. rather than that of loving. of one's capacity to love. Hence the problem to them is how to be loved. how to be lovable. In pursuit of this aIm they rollow several paths. One. which is especially used by men. is to be successful. to be as powerful and rich as the social margin or one's position pennits. Another. used especially by women. is to make oneself attractive. by cultivating one's body. dress. etc. Other ways oC making oneself attractive. used both by men and women. are to develop pleasant manners. interest- ing conversation. to be helpful. modest. Inoffensive. Many of the ways to aiake oneself lovable are the same as those used to make oneself successful. 'to win friends and influence people' . As a matter of fact. what most people in our culture mean by being lovable is essentially a mixture between being popular and having sex appeal. ~ ~ ~ ..... ~:..... ~ ~- .. . - .... . - .... -.. ... -- . .. ~ .... ~ .... :j - ~ . .\"."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\" • • • • -. ...... -. -. -. -. -. -. -.. - .... -. .. .. ..

THE MT or LOVING A second premise behind the attitude that there Is nothing to be learned about love Is the assumptlon that the problem of love Is the problem of an object, not the problem of a/acuity , People think that to love is simple, but that to find the right object to love - or to be loved by - is dl11lcult. This attltude has several reasons rooted In the development of modem soclety_ One reason Is the great change which occurred In the tw.ntleth century with respect to the choice or a 'love object', In the Victorian Age. as In many traditional cul- tures. love was mostly not a spontaneous personal experience which then might lead to marriage. On the contrary, marriage was contracted by convention - either by the respective (amllies. or by a marriage broker, or without the help of such Intermediaries; It was concluded on the basis of social considerations, and love was sup- posed to develop once the marriage had been concluded. In the last rew seaeratlons the concept o( romantlc love has become almost universal In the Western world, In the United States. while consld- eratlons of a conventlonal nature are not entirely absent, to a vart extent people are In search of 'romantic love', of the personal ex- perience of love which then should lead to marriage. This new concept of freedom In love must have greatly enhanced the impor- tance of the obJtcI u against the Importance of the function. Closely related to this factor Is another feature characteristic of contemporary culture. Our whole culture Is based on the appetite for buying, on the Idea of a mutuaUy favourable exchanp. Modern man', happlnea cOOll1II In the IhrIJ1 of looking at the shop win- dows, and In buylnl all that he can afford to buy either for cash or on lrutaiments. He (or she) looks at people in a similar way. For the man an attractlve glrl- and for the woman an attractive man - are the prizes they are after. :-'ttractlve' usually means a nice package of qualltles which are popular and sought aner on the personallty market. What speclftcaUy makes a person attractlve depends on the fashion of the time. physically as well as mentaUy. DurIng the twen- ties, a drinking and smolting girl, tough and sexy, was attractive; today the fashion demands more domestlclty and coyness, At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning ofthls century, a man had 15 LOVE AN AU] to be aggressive and ambitious - today he has to be social and tol- erant -In order to be an attractive 'package'. At any rate. the sense of (ailing In love develops usually only with regard to such human commodities as are within reach of one's own possibilities for exchange . I am out for a bargain; the object should be desirable from the standpoint of Its social value. and at the same time should want me, considering my overt and hidden assets and potentiaU- ties. Two persons thus fall in love when they feel they have found the best object avaUable on the market, considering the lImltatlons of their own exchange values. Often. as in buying real estate. the hidden potentialities which can be developed playa considerable role in this bargain. In a culture In which the marketing orientation prevaUs, and in which material success is the outstanding value, there is little reason to be surprised that human love relatlons Col- low the same pattern of exchange which governs the commodity and the labour market, The third error leading to the assumption that there Is nothing to be learned about love lies in the confusion between the Inltlal ex- perience of '/alltng' In love, and the permanent state of being In love, or as we might better say, of 'standing' in love. If two people who have been strangers, as aU of us are, suddenly let the wall between them break down, and feel close, Ceel one. this moment oC oneness Is one of the most exhilarating, most exciting experiences In life. It Is aU the more wonderful and miraculous for persona who have been shut off. Isolated, without love. Th1a miracle of sudden intima- cy Is often Cacilltated If It Is combined with , or Inltlated by. sexual attractlon and consummation. However, this type oC love Is by Its very nature not lasting. The two persons become weU acquainted, their intlmacy loses more and more Its miraCulous character. unttl their antagonism, their disappointments. their mutual boredom kill whatever is len of the Initial excitement . Yet, In the beginning they do not know all this : In fact . they take the Intensity oC the infatua- tion, this being' crazy' about each other. for prooC oC the intensity of their love, while It may only prove the degree oC their preceding loneliness. - J"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I- I I • THE AItT or LOVING This attitude - that nothlng Is easier than to love - has continued to be the prevalent idea about love in spite or the overwhelming evi- dence to the contrary.

If this were the case with any other activity. people would be eaiOl' to know the reasona for the Cailure. and to learn how one could do better - or they wouJd give up the activity. Since the latter is Impossible in the case oClow. there seems to be only one adequate way to overcome the failure of love - to examine the reasons for this failure. and to proceed to study the meaning oflove.

This holds true for music. for medi- cine. for carpentry - and for love. And. maybe. here li~ the answer to the question of why people in our culture try so rarely to Jearn this art. in spite ol their obvious failures: In spite or the deep-seated craving Cor love. almost everything else Is considered to be more important than love: success. prestige. money. power - almost all , I I I I I I IS LOVE AN An? our energy is used for the learning of how to achleve these aims. and almost none to learn the art orloving.

The experience of separateness arouses anxiety: It Is. Indeed. the source of all anxiety . Belog separate means belog cut 01T . without any capacity to use my human powers. Hence to be separate means to be helpless . unable to grasp the world - things and people - actively : It means that the world can Invade me without my ablllty to react. Thus. separateness Is the source of Intense anxiety. Beyond that . It arouses shame and the feeling of guilt. ThIs experience of guUt and shame In separateness Is expi med In the Biblical story of Adam and BYe . Aller Adam and BYe have eaten of the ' tree of knowledge of good and evll'. after they have disobeyed (there is no good and evil unless there Is freedom to disobey) . after they have become human by having emanclpated themselves from the origi- nal animal harmony with nature . I.e. after their birth as human beings - they saw ·that they were naked - and they were ashamed'.

In the democracies non-eonformlty Is possible and. in fact. by no means entirely absent; In the totalitar- Ian systems. only a few unusual heroes and martyrs can be expect- ed to refuse obedience. But in spite of this difference the democratic societies show an overwhelming degree of conformity. The reason lies In the fact that there Iw to be an answer to the quest for union. and If there Is no other or better way, then the union of herd COD- formity hecomes the predominant one, One can only understand the power of the fear to be different, the fear to he only a few steps away from the herd. If one understands the depths of the need not to be separated. Sometimes this fear of non-conformlty Is ration- alised as fear of practical dangers which could threaten the non- conformist. But actually, people want to conform to a much higher degree than they are Jorred to conform. at least in the Western democracies, Most people are not even aware of their need to conform. They live under the lllusion that they follow their own Ideas and inclina- tions. that they are individualists. that they have arrived at their opinions as the result of their own thlnklng - and that It lust hap- pens that their Ideas are the same as thOle or the malority, The conllellBus of all serves as a proof for the correcIneIB of 'their' Ideas.

Jcutltdie.. 1942 , THE THEORY Of lOVl -..\" modern usage oC the word, is usually meant an action which hrlnp about a change In an existing situatlon by means of an cxpcnditure of energy. Thus a man Is considered active if he does buslness. stud- ies medicine, works on an endless belt, builds a table, or Is enPaed In sports. Common to aU these activltles Is that they are directed towards an outside goal to be achieved. What Is 1101 taken Into account Is the motivation oC activity. Take for Instance a man driven toinCO$SBDt work by a sense of deep insecurity and loneliness, or another one driven by ambition, or greed Cor money. In aU ~ cases the person Is the slave of B passion, and his activity Is ill real· Ity a 'passivity' because he Is driven; he Is the sufferer, not the 'actor'. On the other hand , a man sitting quiet and contempiaUna. with no purpose or aim except that of experiencing himself and his oneness with the world, Is considered to be 'passive', becauae he Is not 'doing' anything. In reality, this attitude oC concentrated medi- tation is the highest activity there Is, an activity of the soul. which is possible only under the condition of Inner freedom aud inde- pendence. One concept oC activity, the modern one, reCers to the use of energy Cor the achievement oC external alms; the other concept of activity reCers to the use of man's Inherent powers, regardless oC whether any external chanae is brought about. The latter concept of activity has been formulated most clearly by SpinOla. He dUrer- entiates among the alTects between active and passive a!Tecta, 'action' Bnd 'passions'. In the exercise of an active affect, man II free, he is the master of his alTect; In the exercise of a passive affect, man is driven , the object of motivations of which he himself Is not aware. Thus Spinoza arrives at the statement that virtue and power are one and the same.' Envy, Jealousy, ambition, any kind of greed are passions; love is an action, the practlce of a human power, which can be practised only in freedom and never as the result of a compulsion. Love is an activity. not a passive affect; it is 'standing In', not a 'Calling Cor' . In the most general way. the active character of love I Spinoa .

Only one who Is deprived of all that goes beyond the barest necessities for subsis- tence would be incapable of enjoying the act of giving material things.

It Is well known that the poor are more willing to give than the rich.

He learns to perceive many other things as being dllTerent, as having an existence of their own . At this point he learns to give them names . At the same Ume he learns to handle them; learns that fire Is hot and painful. that mother's body is warm and pleasureful. that wood Is hard and heavy. that paper is Ught and can be torn. He learns how to handle people; that mother will smUe when I eat: that she will take me In her II!'IIIs when I cry; that she wlll praise me when I have a bowel movement . All these experiences become crystallised and integrat- ed In the experience: I am loved. I am loved because I am mother's child . I am loved because I am helpless . 1 am loved because 1 am beautiful, admirable. 1 am loved because mother needs me. To put It in a more general formula: I fVIIlovtdJor what I am, or perhaps more accurately , I am loved btcause I am. ThIs ~rlence of being loved by mother is a passive one. There Is nothing 1 have to do In order to be loved - mother's love is unconditional. All I have to do is 10 bt - to be her child. Mother's love is bUss, Is peace, It need not be acquired, It need not be deserved. But there is a negative side. too, to the unconditional quality of mother's love. Not only does It not need to be deserved -It also cannol be acquired, produced, controlled. If It is there, Ills like a blessing; If it Is not there, It is as if all beauty had gone out of Ufe - and there is nothing I can do to create It. Por most children before the age from eight and a half to ten,'· the problem Is almost exclusively that of btlng lovtd - of be1ngloved for what one Is. The child up to this age does not yet love; he responds gratefully, joyfully to being loved. At this point of the child's development a new factor enters Into the picture: that of a new feeling; of producing love by one's own activity . !'or the 8rst time, the child thinks of gMng something to mother (or to father), of producing something - a poem. a drawing. or whatever it may be.

Today [. tomorrow you. But this need of help does not metn that the one Is helpless, the other powerful. Helplessness is a transitory condition: the ability to stand and walk on one's own reet 18 the permanen t and common one, Yet, love olthe helpless one. love olthe poor and the stranger, are the beginning 01 brotherly love. To love one's flesh and blood Is no .:hlevement. The animal loves Its young and cares lor them. The helpless one loves his master, since his life depends on him: the child IoveI his parents, since he needs them. Only In the love ofthose who do not serve a purpose, love begins to unfold. SignUlcantly, In the Old Testament, the central oblect or man's love Is the poor, the Itmlaer, the widow and the orphan, and eventually the national enemy. the BtYPtlan and the Edomlte. By having compassion lor the helpless one, man healns to develop love Cor his brother; and In hi. love lor hlmaeJf he also loves the one who Is In need or help, the Crall, Il!Iecure human being. Compassion Imp[1es the element oC knowledge and 01 Identification.

[t Is the attitude which InstiUs In the child a love lor Uvlng, which gives him the feel- Ing: it is good to be alive. It Is good to be a little boy or girl, It is good to be on this earthl These two aspects oC motherly love are expressed very succinctly in the BibUcal story of creation. God creates the world, and man. This corresponds to the simple care and afllrma- tion of existence. But God goes beyond this minimum requirement. On each day after nature - and man - is created, God says: 'It Is good.' Motherly love. In this second step, makes the child feel: It Is good to have been born: It insttlls In the child tlte lovelor HIe, and not only tlte wisb to remain alive. The same Idea may be taken to be expressed In another BlbUcaI symbolism. The promised land (land is always a mother symbol) is described as 'flowing with milk and boney'. Milk Is the symbol ofthe first aspect ortove, that of care and affirmation. Honey symbolises the sweetness of liCe, the love for It and tbe happiness in being alive. Most mothers are capable or giving 'milk', but only a minority of giving 'honey' too. In order to be able to give honey, a mother must not only be 8 'good mother', but a happy person - and this aim Is not achieved by many. The effect on the child can hardly be exaggerated. Mother's love for Ufe Is as Infectious as her anxiety Is, Both attitudes have a deep effect on the child's whole personality; one can distinguish Indeed. among children - and adults - those who ~t only 'milk' and those who ~t 'milk and honey'. In contrast to brotherly love and erotic love Which are love between equals. the relationship of mother and child is by Its very nature one 0( inequality, where one needs all the help, and the other gives it. It Is for this a!truistlc. unselfish character that moth- erly love has been considered the highest kind of love, and the most sacred 01 all emotional bonds, [t seems, however, that the real achievement of motherly love lies not In the mother's love lor the smaU inlant, but in her kwe for the growing child.

This person can be cured only if his unselfishness too Is Interpreted as a symptom alon& with the others. so that his lack oC productiveness, which Is at the root of both his unselfishness and his other troubles, can be corrected. The nature oC unselfishness becomes particularly apparent In its THE THEOay OF Lon - effect on others, and most frequently In our culture In . the effect the 'unselfish' mother nas on her children. She believes that by her unselfisnness ner children wUl experience what il means to be loved and to learn, in turn, what It means to love. The effect of bel' unselfishness, however, does not at all correspond to her expecta- tions. The children do not show the happiness of persons who are convinced that tney are loved; they are anxious, tense, afraid of the mother's disapproval and anxious to live up to her expectatioDS. Usually, they are affected by their mother's hidden hostility towardl life, which they sense rather than recognise c\\early, and evontu. tney become Imbued with It tnemselves.

They are put under the obllgatlon not to disappoint her: they are taullht, under the IIl8Sk oC virtue, dislike for life. If one baa a chance to study the dreet oC • mother with genuine self-love, one can see that there Is nothlnll more conducive to giving a child the experience of what love. joy and nappiness are tnan being loved by a mother wno loves herIeIf. These ideas on self-love cannot be summarised belter than by quoting Meister Eckhart on this topic: 'ICyou love yourselt you love everybody else as you do yourself. As long as you love another person less tnan you love yourself, you will not really sliCCeed In loving yourseU: but if you love all alike, including yourselt you wUl love them as one person and that person 1& both God and mao. Thus he is a great and righteous person who, loving himself, klves all others equally.'''

When Moses tells him that the Hebrews wUl not believe that God has sent him. unless he can tell them God'. name (how could Idol worshippers comprehend a nameless God, since the very essence of an Idol Is to have a namel). God makes a concession. He tells Moses that his name is '1 am becomlnl that which I am becomlnl·. 'I-em-becoming Is my nlme.' The 'I-am-becomlnl' means that God Is not finite, not a per- son. not a 'being', The most adequate translation of the sentence would be; tell them that 'my name is nameless'.

In the subsequent theological development. the Ide\" is carried further In the principle that one must not even give God any positive attribute. To say of God that he is wise. strong . aood Implies again that he Is a person; the most I can do Is to say what God Is not, to state negative attributes. to postulate that he is not limited, not unkind, not THE TH EOlty OF LOVE -- unjust. The more I know what God is not, the more knowledge I have of God . \" Following the maturing Idea of monotheism In Its further conse- quences can lead only to one conclusion: not to mention God's name at all. not to speak about God. Then God becomes what he potentially Is in monotheistic theology, the nameless One, an Inex- pressible stammer. referring to the unity underlying the phenom- enal universe. the ground of all existence; God becomes truth. love. justice . God is I. Inasmuch as I am human. Quite eVidently this evolution from the anthropomolllhic to the pure monotheistic principle makes all the difference to the nature of the love of God. The God of Abraham can be loved. or feared, as a father, sometimes his fOl'llveness, sometimes his anger being the dominant aspect. Inasmuch as God Is the father. I am the child . I have not emerged fully from the autistic wish for omniscience and omnipotence. [ have not yet acqutred the objectivity to reaUse my limitations as a human being, my Ignorance . my helplessness . I still claim. like a child. that there must be a father who rescues me. who watches me. who punishes me. a father who likes me when I am obedient. who Is flattered by my praise and angry because of my disobedience. Quite obviously, the majOrity of people have, In their personal development. not overcome this Infantile stage. and hence the belief In God to most people Is the belief In a helpln, father - a childish illusion. In spite oUhe fact that this concept ofrelillon has been overcome by some of the great teachers of the human race. and by a minority of men. It Is sUn the dOminant fonn of religion. Inasmuch as this Is so. the criticism of the Idea 01 God, as It was expressed by Freud. Is quite correct The error, however. was In the ract that he Ignored the other aspect of monotheistic religion, and its true kernel, the logic of which leads exactly to the negation of this concept of God.

THE THEOIY OF LOVE \"'- the knowledge that it cannot give us the ultimate answer. The world of thOUllht remllins caught in the paradox. The only way in which the world can he arasped ultimately lies. not in thouaht, but in the act. in the experience of onenesa. Thus paradoxical Ioaic leads to the conclusion that the love or God Is neither the kaowledie of God in thought, nor the thought of one's love of God. but the act or exper\\encln g the oneness with God, This leads to the emphasis on the riBht way of living. All of life. every little and every important action. is devoted to the kaowledge of God, but a knowledge not in right thousht, but in right action, This can be clearly seen In Oriental religions, In Brahmanism as well as in Buddhism and Taoism, the uillma~ aim of religion Is not the right belier, but the riBht action. We find the same emphuls In the Jewish religion, There was hardly ever a schism over belief In the Jewish tradition (the one great exception, the difference between Pharisees and Sadducees, was essenllally one of two opposite social classes). The emphasis of the Jewish relilion W8I (especially from the beginning or our era on) on the right way of liv- ing, the Halacha (this word actually having the same meaninll as the Tao), in modem history, the same principle is expressed in Ihe thought of Spino.a. Marx and Freud. [n Spinoza's philosophy the emphasll is shifted from the rlsht belief to the right conduct oC life. Marx states the same principie when he said, 'The philosophers have interpreted the world in different ways -the task Is to tranaform It: Preud'. paradoxiealloglc ieada him to the process ofpsychoanalyt- ie therapy, the ever deepening experience of oneself, From the standpoint of paradoxicallogie the emphasis Is not on thought, but on the act. This attitude had severai other conse- quences. First 01 all , it led to the toleranct which we find in Indian and Chinese religious development. If the right thought Is not the uitimate truth. and not the way to salvation, there is no reason to fight athers. whose thinking has arrived at different formulations, This tolerance Is beaulilully expressed in the story oC several men who were asked to describe an elephant in the dark.

The human problem of modern capitalism can be formulated in this way: Modern capitalism needs men who co-operate smoothly and In large numbers: who want to consume more and more: and whose tastes are standardised and can be easily iofiuenced and anticipat- ed. It needs men who feel free and independent. not subject to any authority or principle or conscience - yet willing to be commanded. to do what is expected of them. to fit into the social machine with- out friction; who can be guided without force, led without leaders. prompted without aim - except the one to make good. to be on the move. to function. to go ahead. What Is the outcome? Modern man Is alienated from himself. from his fellow men. and from nature.' He has been transformed into a commodity. experiences his life forces as an investment which must bring him the maximum proftt obtainable under exist- ing market conditions. Human relations are essentially those of alienated automatons. each basing his security on staying close to the herd. and not being different In thought. feeling or action. WhIle everybody tries to be as close as possible to the rest. every- body remains utterly alone. pervaded by the deep sense of insecu- rity. anxiety and gullt which always results when human separate- ness cannot be overcome. Our civilisation offers many palliatives which help people to be consciously unaware of this aloneness: 8rst of all the strict routine of bureaucratlsed. mechanical. work. which helps people to remain unaware of their most fundamental human desires, of the longing for transcendence and unity. Inasmuch as the routine alone does not succeed in this. man overcomes his unconscious despair by the routine of amusement. the passive con- sumption of sounds and sights olTered by the amusement industry: furthermore by the satisfaction of buying ever new things. and soon exchanging them for others.

But while the data of psychoanalytic therapy point to the fallacy of the Idea that knowledge of the correct sexual technique leads to sexual happiness and love, the underlying assumpllon that love Is the concomitant of mutual sexual satisfaction was largely Influ- enced by the theories of Freud. For Freud, love was basically a sex- ual phenomenon.

Failing In love always verges on the abnormal, Is always accompanied by blindness to reality, compulsiveness, and is a trans- ference from love objects of childhood. Love as a rational phenom- enon, as the crowning achlevement cl maturity, was, to Freud, no subject matter for investigation, since It had no real existence. However, It would be a mistake to overestimate the Inlluence of Freud's ideas on the concept that love Is the result of sexual attrac- tion, or rather that It Is the sam~ as sexual satisfaction, reOected In conscious feeHng. Essentia[1y the causal nexus proceeds the other way around. Freud's Ideas were partly Inlluenced by the spirit of the nineteenth century; partly they became popular through the prevalhng spirit oCthe years after the First World War , Some of the factors which Influenced both the popular and the Freudian con- cepts were, first, the reaction against the strict mores of the Victorian age. The second factor determlnlog Freud's theories bes in the prevailing concept of man, which Is based on the structure of capitalism, In order to prove that capitalism corresponded to the natural needs of man, One had to show that man was by nature competitive and full cl mutual hostility. WhIle economists 'proved' this In terms of the Insatiable desire for economic gain , and the Darwinists In terms of the biological law of the survival of the fittest, Freud came to the same result by the aSsumption that man is driven by a limitless desire for the sexual conquest of all women, and that only the pressure of SOCiety prevented man fi'om acting on his desires. As a result men are necessarlly jealous or each other, and this mutual jealousy and competition would continue even If all social and economic reasons for It would disappear .' Eventually, Freud was largely Influenced in his thin\\cJng by the type of materialism prevalent In the nineteenth century . One believed that the substratum of all mental phenomena was to be found in phYSiological phenomena; hence love, hate, ambition, jealousy were explained by Freud as so many outcomes of various • l'Irt.l..ttrwn of Low.

It is a description or an 'elJltism \" dtl/%', or two people pooling their common interests. aDd standing tosether against a hostile and alienated world. Actually his definition or Intimacy is In principle valid for the feeUng of any CCHlperating team. In which everybody 'adjusts his behaviour to the expressed needs oC the other person in the pursuit of co~ aims' (It Is remarkable that Sullivan speaks here of exprtsstd needs. when the least one could say about love Is that it implies a reaction to unerprtsstd needs between two people).

C'\"'\""},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"'\"l AIII1 Of LOVING Th. basic condition for neurotic love lies in the fact that one or both of the 'lovers' have remained attached to the figure of a parent. and transl'er the feelings,. expectations and fears one once had towards father or mother\\o the loved person In adult life; the per- sons Involved have never emerged from a pattern of lnfantUe relat- edness. and seek for this pattern In their effective demands In adult Ufe. In these cases. the person has remained. affectlvely. a child of two. or of five. or of twelve, while Intellectually and socially he Is on the level of his chronological age. In the more severe cases. this emotional Immaturity leads to disturbances In his social effective- ness; In the less severe ones, the conflict Is limited to the sphere of Intimate personal relationships. Referring to our previous discussion of the mother- or father- centred personality, the following example of this type of neurotic love relation to be found frequently today deals with men who In their emotional development have remained stuck In an Inrantlle attachment to mother. These men still feel like children; they want mother's protection, love, warmth. care, and admiration; they Wlnt mother'S unconditional love, a love which Is given for no other reason than that they need It. that they are mother's child. that they are helpless. Such men frequently are quite affectionate and charming If they try to Induce a woman to love them. and even after they have succeeded In this. But their relationship to the woman (as. In Cact. to all other people) remains superfiCial and Irre- sponsible. Their aim Is to be loved, not to love. There Is usually a good deal of vanity In this type of man, more oc less hidden grandiose Ideas. If they have found the right woman, they feel secure . on top of the world. and can display a great deal of affection and charm. and this is the reason why these men are often so deceptive. But when. after a while. the woman does not continue to live up to their phantastlc expectations. conflicts and resentment start to develop. If the woman is not always admiring them. if she makes claims for a life of her own. if she wants to be loved and protected herseU. and in extreme cases. iC she Is not willing to con- done his love affairs with other women (or even have an admiring 74 - LOVE ....

Anything short of the attitude of a loving mother towards a charming child Is taken as proof of a lack onove. These men usually confuse their affectionate behaViour, their wish to please, with genuine love and thus arrive at the conclusion that they are being treated quite unfairly; they imagine themselves to be the great lovers and complain bitterly about the Ingratitude of their love partner. In rare cases such a mother-centred person can function without any severe disturbances. If his mother, In fact. 'Ioved' him in an overprotective manner (perhaps being dOmineering. but without being destructive). If he finds a wife of the same motherly type,lfhls speCial gifts and talents permit him to use his charm and be admired (as Is the case sometimes with successful politicians), he Is 'well adjusted' In a social sense. without ever reaching a higher level of maturity. But under less favourable conditions - and these are naturally more frequent - his love Ufe. If not his social liCe. will be a serious disappointment; conflicts. and frequently intense anxi- ety and depression arise when this type of personality Is left alone. In a stili more severe form of pathology the fixation to mother is deeper and more irrational. On this level. the wish Is not. symboll- caUy speaking. to return to mother's protecting arms. nOr to her nourishing breast. but to her all-recelvlng - and aU-destroying- womb. If the nature of sanity Is to grow out of the womb Into the world. the nature of severe mental disease Is to be attracted by the womb. to be sucked back Into It - and that is to be taken away from nfe.

What Is characteristic £Or this type of Idolatrous love Is. at the beginning. the Intensity and sud- denness of the love experience. This Idolatrous love Is often described as the true. great love; but while It Is meant to portray the Intensity and depth of love. it only demonstrates the hunger and despair of the Idolator. Needless to say it Is not rare that two persons Rnd each other In a mutual idolatry which. sometimes. In extreme cases. represents the picture of a IoHt II deux. . Another form of pseudo-love Is what may be called 'stntimmtaJ 1_'. Ita essence lies In the fact that love Is experienced only In phantasy and not In the here-and-now relationship to another per- son who Is real. The most widespread form of this type oflove Is that to be found In the vacarlous love satisfaction experienced by the COONmer of screen pictures, magazine love stories and love songs . All the unfuUllled desires for love, union, and c10senesa lind their Sltlsfaction In the consumption of these products. A man and a woman who In relation to their spouses are Incapable or ever pen- etratlnl the wall of separateness are moved to tears when they par- ticipate In the happy or unhappy love story or the couple on the screen. For many couples, seelnB these stories on the screen Is the only occasion on which they experience love - not £or each other, but together, as spectators of other people's 'love'. ,.. long as love Is a day-dream, they can participate; as soon as It comes down to the reality of the relationship between two real people - they are frozen, Another aspect of sentimental love Is the abstractiOcation of love in terms of time. A couple may be deeply moved by memories or their post love. although when this past was present no love was experienced - or the phantasies of their future love. How many engaged or newly married couples dream of their bliss or love to take place In the future, while at the very moment at which they live they are already beginning to be bored wlth each otherl 'IbIs tendency coincides with a general attitude characteristic of modern man. He lives In the past or in the future, but not In the present. He lOVE AND ITS DISINTEGRATION IN CONHMPOlAkV WUHaN SOCIETT remembers sentimentally his childhood and his mother - or he makes happy plans for the future. Whether love Is experienced vIc- ariously by participating in the 6ctltious experiences of others. or whether It is shifted away from the present to the past or the future, this abstractified and aUenated form of love serves as an opiate whleh alleViates the pain of reality, the aloneness and separateness of the individual. Still another form of neurotic love Ues In the use of pro/tcUvt mtchanlsms for the purpose of avoiding one's own problems, and being. concerned with the defects and frailties of the 'loved' person Instead. IndiViduals behave in this respect very much as groups, nations or religions do. They have a One appreciation for even the minor shortcomings of the other person, and go blissfully ahead ignoring their own - always busy trying to accuse or to reform the other person. If two people both do It - as Is so often the case - the relationship of love becomes transformed Into one of mutual pro- jection. If I am domineering or Indecisive. or greedy, I accuse my partner of It. and depending on my character, I either want to cure him or to punish him. The other person does the same - and both thus succeed In Ignoring their own problems and hence fall to undertake any steps which would help them In their own develop- ment. Another form of projection Is the projection of one's own prob- lems on the children. First of all such proJection takes place not Infrequently In the wish for children. In such cases the wish for children IS primarily determined by projecting one's own problem of existence on that of the children. When a person feels that he has not been able to make sense of his own life. he tries to make sense of it in terms ofth.lif. of his children. But one Is bound to fall within oneself and for the chlldren. The former because the problem of existence can be solved by each one only for himself, and not by proxy; the latter because one lacks In the very qualities which one needs to guide the children In their own search for an answer. Children serve for projective purposes also when the question arises of dissolving an unhappy marriage. The stock argument of - - 79"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":", , \" , \\1 \".\"\", THl All' 0' LOVING 80 - parents In such a situation is that they cannot separate in order not to deprive the children of the blessinllS of a unified home . Any detailed study would shOW. hawever. that the atmosphere of lellllon and unhappiness within the 'unilled family' Is more harmful to the children than an open break would be - which teaches them at least that man is able to end an intolerable situation by a coura- geous decision. One 'Other frequent error must be mentioned here. The illusion, namely. that love means necessarily the absence of conflict. Just as it is customary lor people to believe that pain and sadness should be avoided under aU ci«:umstan.ees. they believe that love means the absenoe of any cqnfiict. And they find ~ reasons for this idea in the fact that the ~uIes around them seem only to be destructive interchanges wh\\o;h bring no .,00 to either one of those concerned. But the reason for this lies iD the tact that the 'conlUcts' oC most people are actu.ly attempts to avoid the (tal conHicts. They are . disallreements on minor or superficial mauers which by their very nature do not lend themselves to clarillcation or solution . Real con- IUcts between tWl! people, thole which do not serve to cover up or to project, but which are experleoced on the deep level orinner reality to whiCh they beloas. lIle not deitructive. They lead to darillcation, they produce a catharsis !rom which both persons emet'1e with mare knowledge and more slrenllth. This leads us to emphasise again somethinll said above. Love is possible only If two persons communicate with each other from the centre 01 their existence, hence if each one of them experi- enoes himself from the centre of his ex\\stenc;e. Only in this ' central experience' is human reality , only here is aliveness , only here is the basis for love. Love. experienced thus, is a constant challenge; it is not a resting place . but a moving. growing . working together: even whether there is harmony or conOict. joy or sadness, Is sec- ondary to the fundamentallact that two people experience them- selves !rom the essence of their existenoe, that they are one with each other by being one with themselves, rather than by fieelng from themsel ves. There is only one prooC Cor the presence or love: LOVE AND Irs DI SINltGkA.TION IN CONUM'OlAl'r W[SrU.N SOCIETY - the depth oC the relationship. and the aliveness and strenlth in each person canoemed; this is the fruit by which love is recol!Jllsed.

This fact is ill blatant contradictiOn to the idea that we are wltnessina a religiQUs renais- sance In this epoch . Nothing could be further from the truth.

The steps toward the goal can be practised only by oneself. and discussion ends before the decisive step is taken. Yet. J believe that the discussion of the approaches may be helplul for the mastery of the arl - lor those al least who have freed themselves from expecting 'prescriptions'. The practice of any art has certain IIImeral requirements. quite regardless of whether we deal with the art of carpentry. medicine. or the art of love. First of all. the practice of an art requires discipline . 1 shall never be ~ at anything if I do not do it in a disciplined way; anything I do only if'l am In the mood ' may be a nice or amus- ing hobby. but 1 shall never become a master in that art . But the I. I THE P~ACTICf OF LOVE -- problem Is not only that of discipline in the practice of the particu- lar art (say practising every day a ca1ain amount of houra) but it is that of discipline in one's whole Ufe. Om might think thai noth- Ing is easier to learn for modem man than discipline . Does he not spend elaht hours a day In a most disciplined way at a job which Is strictiy routinlsedl The fact. however. is that modern maR has exceedingly Uttle self-discipline outside of the sphere of work. When he does not work. he wants to be lazy. to slouch or. to use a nlcer word. to ·relax·. This very wilh for laziness is largely a reaction against the routinisatlon of life . Just because man is forced for e1aht hours a day to spend his energy for purposes not his own. in ways not his own. but prescribed for him by the rhythm of the work. he rebels and his rebelliousness takes the form 01 an infantile telf- indulaence. In addition. in the battie against aulhoritarlanism he has become distrustful of all dIicIpllne. of that enforced by Irra- tional autborlty, as well as of rational discipline Imposed by himselC.

A third factor is patience. Again. anyone who ever tried to master an art knows that patience is necessary if you want 10 achieve any- thing. If one is after quick results. one never learns an art.

AD our machines are designed lor quickness : the car and aeroplane bring us qulckly to our destination - and the quicker the better. The machine which can produce the same quan- tity In half the time Is twice as good as the older and slower one. 01 course, there are Important economic reasons Cor this . But. as In so many other aspects, human values have become determined by economic values. What Is good for machines must be good for man - so ~ the logic. Modern man thinks he loses something - time - when he does not do things qulckly; yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains - except kill It. !!ventually. a condition of learning any art Is a suprtme con~m with the mastery of the art. If the art is not something of supreme Importance. the apprentice will never learn It. He will remain. at belt . a good dilettante. but will never become a master . This condi- tion III as n~ary for the art 01 loving as for any other art . It seems. though. as lIthe proportion between masters and dilettantes Is more heavily weighted In Cavour 01 the dilettantes In the art oC Iovlna than Is the case with other arts. One more point must be made with regard to the leneral condi- tions ollearnlng art. One does not begin to le ... n an art directly. but Indirectly. as It were. One must learn a great number 01 other - and olten seemingly disconnected - things beCore one starts with the art Itself. An apprentice In carpentry begins by learning how to plane wood; an apprentice in the art of plano playing beginS by practising scales; an apprentice In the Zen art oC archery begins by doing breathing exercises.' If one wants to become a master In any art. one 's whole 1I1e must be devoted to it. or at least related to It. One's own person becomes an Instrument In the practice of tlie art. and must be kept fit. according to the specific functions It has to fulfil.

Our grandlathers would have been much better equlpped to answer this question . Their recom - mendation was to get up early in the morning, not to Indulge In unnecessary luxuries, to work hard. This type of diSCipline has obviOUS shortcomings. It was rigid and authoritarian. was centred around the virtues of frugality and saving. and In many ways was hostile to life. But In a reaction to this kind of discipline. there has been an Increasing tendency to be suspiCiOUS 01 any discipline. and to make undisciplined, 1a2y indulgence In the rest of one's life the counterpart and balance for the routlnised way 01 life Imposed on us during the eight hours of work. To get up at a regular hour, to devote a regular amount of time during the day to activities such as meditating. reading, listening to music , walking ; not to Indulge. at least not beyond a certain minimum, In escapist activities like mys- tery stories and movies. not to overeat or overdrink are some obvi- ous and rudimentary rules. It Is essential, however. that discipline should not be practised like a rule Imposed on onesellfrom the out- side. but that It becomes an expression olone's own wi]]; that It Is felt as pleasant. and that one slowly accustoms oneself to a kind 01 behaviour which one would eventually miss, If one stopped practis- Ing It. It Is one 01 the unCortunate aspects olour Western concept of discipline (as of every virtue) that Its practice is supposed to be somewhat painful and only Iflt Is painful can It be 'good'. The East has recognised long ago that that which is good for man - lor his body and for his soul - must also be agreeable, even though at the beginning some resistance must be overcome . Concentration Is by lar more difficult to practise In our culture. In which everything seems to act against the ability to concentrate. The-most important step In learning concentration Is to learn to be alone with onesell without reading, listening to the radio. smoking or drinking. Indeed. to be able to concentrate means to be able to be alone with oneself - and this ab16ty Is precisely a condition for the ability to love .

Does the latter not Imply giving up all one's secular concerns and sharing the nfe of the poorest? This question has been raised and answered in a radical way by the Christian monks, and by persons like Tolstoy, Albert Schweitzer. and Simone Well . There are others' who share the opinion of the basic Incom- patibility between love and normal secular life within our society: They arrive at the result that to speak of love today means only to participate In the general fraud: they claim that only a martyr or a mad person can love In the world of today, hence that all discussion of love Is nothing but preaching, This very respectable viewpoint lends itseH readily to a rationalisation of cynicism. Actually it is shared Implicitly by the average person who feels 'I would like to be a good Chrlstlan - but [ would bave to starve if I meant It seriously.'

THE PRACTICE OF LOVl -- I am olthe conviction that the answer of the absolute incompat- ibility of love and 'normal' life Is correct only in an abstract sense, The principle underlying capitalistic society and the principle of love are incompatible. But modem society seen concretely Is a complex phenomenon. A salesman of a useless commodity, for Instance, cannot function economically without lying: a skilled worker, a chemist, or a physician can , Similarly, a farmer, a worker, a teacher. and many a type of bUSinessman can try to practise love without ceasing to function economically, Bven II one recognises the princi- ple of capitalism as being Incompatible with the principle of love, one must admit that 'capitalism' Is In Itself a complex and con- stantly changing structure which still permits of a good deal of non-conformlty and of personal latitude, In saying this, however, I do not wish to Imply that we can expect the present social system to continue Indellnltely, and at the same lime to hope for the realisation of the ideal of love for one's brother, People capable oflove , under the present system, are necessarily the exceptions: love Is by necessity a marginal phenomenon In present- day Western society. Not so much because many occupations would not permit of a loving aWtude, but because the spirit of a production-centred, commodlty-greedy society Is such that only the non -conformist can defend himself successfully against it, Those who are seriously concerned with love as the only rational answer to the problem of human existence must, then, arrive at the conclusion that important and radical changes in our social struc- ture are necessary, if love Is to become a social and not a highly individualistic, marginal phenomenon. The direction of such changes can, within the scope of this book, only be hinted at,' Our SOCiety Is run by a managerial bureaucracy, by profeSSional politi- cians: people are motivated by mass sugestlon, their aim Is pr0- ducing more and consuming more, as purposes In themselves.
