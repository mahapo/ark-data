About the Author Eustace Mullins is a veteran of the Un ited States Air Force, with thirty- eight months of active service during World War II. A native Virginian, he was educated at Washington and Lee University, New York University, Ohio University, t he University of North Dakota, the Escuelas des Bellas Artes, San Mi guel de Allende, Mexico, and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Washington, D.C. The original book, published under the title Mullins On The Federal Reserve, was commissioned by the poet Ezra Pound in 1948. Ezra Pound was a political prisoner for thirteen and a half years at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington, D. C. (a Federal in stitution for the insane). His release was accomplis hed largely through the efforts of Mr. Mullins. The research at the Library of Co ngress was directed and reviewed daily by George Stimpson, founder of the National Press Club in Washington, whom The New York Times on September 28, 1952 called, \"A highly regarded reference source in the capitol. Government officials, Congressmen, and reporters went to him for information on any subject.\" Published in 1952 by Kasper and Hort on, New York, the original book was the first nationally-circulated re velation of the secret meetings of the international bankers at Jekyll Island, Georgia, 1907-1910, at which place the draft of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was written.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Foreword In 1949, while I was visiting Ezra Pound who was a political prisoner at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington, D.C. (a Federal institution for the insane), Dr. Pound asked me if I had ever heard of the Federal Reserve System. I replied that I had not, as of the age of 25. He then showed me a ten dollar bill marked \"Federal Reserve Note\" and asked me if I would do some research at the Library of Congress on the Federal Reserve System which had issued this bill. Pound was unable to go to the Library hims elf, as he was being held without trial as a political prisoner by th e United States government. After he was denied broadcasting time in the U.S., Dr. Pound broadcast from Italy in an effort to persuade pe ople of the United States not to enter World War II. Franklin D. Roosevelt had personally ordered Pound’s indictment, spurred by t he demands of his three personal assistants, Harry Dexter White, Lauc hlin Currie, and Alger Hiss, all of whom were subsequently ident ified as being connected with Communist espionage. I had no interest in money or banking as a subject, because I was working on a novel. Pound offered to supplement my income by ten dollars a week for a few weeks. My initial research revealed evidence of an international ba nking group which had secretly planned the writing of the Federal Reserve Act and Congress’ enactment of the plan into law. These findings confirmed what Pound had long suspecte d. He said, \"You must work on it as a detective story.\" I was fortunate in having my research at the Library of Congress directed by a promi nent scholar, George Stimpson, founder of the National Press Club, who was described by The New York Times of September 28, 1952: \"Beloved by Washington newspapermen as ‘our walking Libr ary of Congress’, Mr. Stimpson was a highly regarded reference so urce in the Capitol. Government officials, Congressmen and reporters went to him for information on any subject.\" I did research four hours each day at the Library of Congress, and went to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in the afternoon. Pound and I went over the previous day’s notes. I then had dinner with George Stimpson at Scholl’s Cafeteria while he went over my material, and I then went back to my room to type up the corrected notes. Both Stimpson and Pound made many suggestions in guiding me in a field in which I had no previo us experience. When Pound’s resources ran low, I applied to the Guggenheim Foundation, Huntington Hartford Foundation, and other foundations to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 complete my research on the Federal Reserve. Even though my foundation applications were spon sored by the three leading poets of America, Ezra Pound, E.E. Cummi ngs, and Elizabeth Bishop, all of the foundations refused to sponsor this research. I then wrote up my findings to date, and in 1950 began ef forts to market this manuscript in New York. Eighteen publishers turned it down without comment, but the nineteenth, Devin Garrit y, president of Devin Adair Publishing Company, gave me some friendly advice in his office. \"I like your book, but we can’t prin t it,\" he told me. \"Neither can anybody else in New York. Why don’ t you bring in a prospectus for your novel, and I think we can gi ve you an advance. You may as well forget about getting the Fed eral Reserve book published. I doubt if it could ever be printed.\" This was devastating news, coming after two years of intensive work. I reported back to Pound, and we tried to find a publisher in other parts of the country. After two years of fruitless submis sions, the book was published in a small edition in 1952 by two of Pound’s disciples, John Kasper and David Horton, using their private funds, under the title Mullins on the Federal Reserve. In 1954, a second edition, with unauthorized alterations, was pu blished in New Jersey, as The Federal Reserve Conspiracy. In 1955, Guido Roeder brought out a German edition in Oberammergau, Germany. The book was seized and the entire edition of 10,000 copies burned by government agents led by Dr. Otto John. The burning of the book was uphel d April 21, 1961 by judge Israel Katz of the Bavarian Supreme Cour t. The U.S. Government refused to intervene, because U.S. High Commissioner to Germany, James B. Conant (president of Harvard University 1933 to 1953), had approved the initial book burning or der. This is the only book which has been burned in Germany sinc e World War II. In 1968 a pirated edition of this book appeared in Ca lifornia. Both the FBI and the U.S. Postal inspectors refused to act, despite numerous complaints from me during the next decade. In 1980 a new German edition appeared. Because the U.S. Government apparently no longer dictated the internal affairs of Germany, the identical book which had been burned in 1955 now circulates in Germany without interference. I had collaborated on several books with Mr. H.L. Hunt and he suggested that I should continue my long-delayed research on the Federal Reserve and bring out a more definitive version of this book. I had just signed a co ntract to write the authorized biography of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Ezra Pound, and the Federal Reserve book had to be postponed. Mr. Hunt passed away before I could get back to my research, and once again I faced the problem of financing research for the book. My original book had traced and named the shadowy figures in the United States who planned the Federal Reserve Act. I now discovered that the men whom I exposed in 1952 as the shadowy figures behind the operation of the Federal Reserve System were themselves shadows, the American fronts for the unknown figures who became known as the \"London Connection.\" I found that notwithstanding our successes in the Wars of Independence of 1812 against England, we remained an economic and financial colony of Great Britain. For the first time, we located the original stockholders of the Federal Reserv e Banks and traced their parent companies to the London Connection. This research is substantiated by citations and documentation from hundreds of newspapers, periodicals and books and charts showing blood, marriage, and business relationships. More than a thousand issues of The New York Times on microfilm have been checked not only for original information, but verification of statements from other sources. It is a truism of the writing professi on that a writer has only one book within him. This seems applicable in my case, because I am now in the fifth decade of continuous writing on a single subj ect, the inside story of the Federal Reserve System. This book was from its inception commissioned and guided by Ezra Po und. Four of his protégés have previously been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, William Butler Yeats for his later poetry , James Joyce for \"Ulysses\", Ernest Hemingway for \"The Sun Also Rises\", and T.S. Elliot for \"The Waste Land\". Pound played a major role in the inspiration and in the editing of these works--which leads us to believe that this present work, also inspired by Pound, represents an ongoing literary tradition. Although this book in its inception was expected to be a tortuous work on economic and monetary techniques, it soon developed into a story of such universal and dramatic appeal that from the outset, Ezra Pound urged me to write it as a detective story, a genre which was invented by my fellow Virginian, Edgar Allan Poe. I believe that the continuous circulat ion of this book during the past forty years has not only exonerated Ezra Pound for his much condemned political and monetary statements, but also that it has"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 been, and will continue to be, t he ultimate weapon against the powerful conspirators who compe lled him to serve thirteen and a half years without trial, as a poli tical prisoner held in an insane asylum a la KGB. His earlie st vindication came when the government agents who represented the conspirators refused to allow him to testify in his own def ense; the second vindication came in 1958 when these same agents dropped all charges against him, and he walked out of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, a free man once more. His third and final vindicatio n is this work, which documents every aspect of his exposure of t he ruthless international financiers to whom Ezra Pound became bu t one more victim, doomed to serve years as the Man in the Iron Mask, because he had dared to alert his fellow-Americans to their furtive acts of treason against all people of the United States. In my lectures throughout this nation, and in my appearances on many radio and television programs, I have sounded the toxin that the Federal Reserve System is not Feder al; it has no reserves; and it is not a system at all, but rather , a criminal syndicate. From November, 1910, when the conspira tors met on Jekyll Island, Georgia, to the pres ent time, the machinations of the Federal Reserve bankers have been shroud ed in secrecy. Today, that secrecy has cost the American people a three trillion dollar debt, with annual interest payments to these bankers amounting to some three hundred billion dollars pe r year, sums which stagger the imagination, and which in themse lves are ultimately unpayable. Officials of the Federal Reserve Sy stem routinely issue remonstrances to the public, much as the Hindu fa kir pipes an insistent tune to the dazed cobra which sways its head before him, not to resolve the situation, but to prevent it from st riking him. Such was the soothing letter written by Donald J. Winn, Assistant to the Board of Governors in response to an inquiry by a Congressman, the Honorable Norman D. Shumway, on March 10, 1983. Mr . Winn states that \"The Federal Reserve System was established by an act of Congress in 1913 and is not a ‘private corporation’ .\" On the next page, Mr. Winn continues, \"The stock of the Federal Reserve Banks is held entirely by commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.\" He offers no explanatio n as to why the government has never owned a single sh are of stock in any Federal Reserve Bank, or why the Federal Reserve System is not a \"private corporation\" when all of its stock is owned by \"private corporations\"."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 American history in the twentieth century has recorded the amazing achievements of the Federal Reserve bankers. First, the outbreak of World War I, which was made possible by the funds available from the new central bank of the United States. Second, the Agricultural Depression of 1920. Third, the Black Friday Crash on Wall Street of October, 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. Fourth, World War II. Fifth, the conver sion of the assets of the United States and its citizens from real property to paper assets from 1945 to the present, transforming a victorious America and foremost world power in 1945 to the world’s largest debtor nation in 1990. Today, this nation lies in economic ruins, devastated and destitute, in much the same dire straits in which Germany and Japan found themselves in 1945. Will Americans act to rebuild our nation, as Germany and Japan have done w hen they faced the identical conditions which we now face--or will we continue to be enslaved by the Babylonian debt money sy stem which was set up by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 to complete our total destruction? This is the only question which we have to answer, and we do not have much time left to answer it. Because of the depth and the impo rtance of the information which I had developed at the Library of Congress under the tutelage of Ezra Pound, this work became the happy hunting ground for many other would-be historians, who were unable to research this material for themselves. Over the past four decades, I have become accustomed to seeing this material appear in many other books, invariably attributed to other writers, with my name never mentioned. To add insult to inju ry, not only my material, but even my title has been appropriated, in a massive, if obtuse, work called \"Secrets of the Temple--the Federal Reserve\". This heavily advertised book received reviews ranging from incredulous to hilarious. Forbes Magazine advised its readers to re ad their review and save their money, pointing out that \"a reader will discover no secrets\" and that \"This is one of those books whose fanfares far exceed their merit.\" This was not accidental, as this overblown whitewash of the Federal Reserve bankers was published by the most famous nonbook publisher in the world. After my initial shock at discovering that the most influential literary personality of the twentieth century, Ezra Pound, was imprisoned in \"the Hellhole\" in Washington, I immediately wrote for assistance to a Wall Street financier at whose esta te I had frequently been a guest. I reminded him that as a patron of the arts, he could not afford to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 allow Pound to remain in such in human captivity. His reply shocked me even more. He wrote back that \"your friend can well stay where he is.\" It was some years before I was able to understand that, for this investment banker and his co lleagues, Ezra Pound would always be \"the enemy\". Introduction Here are the simple facts of the great betrayal. Wilson and House knew that they were doing something momentous. One cannot fathom men’s motives and this pair probably believed in what they were up to. What they did not believe in was representative government. They believed in government by an uncontrolled oligarchy whose acts would only become apparent after an interval so long that the electorate would be forever incapable of doing anything efficient to remedy depredations. (AUTHOR’S NOTE: Dr. Pound wrote this introduction for the earliest version of this book, published by Kasper and Horton, New York, 1952. Because he was being held as a political prisoner without trial by the Federal Government, he coul d not afford to allow his name to appear on the book because of additional reprisals against him. Neither could he allow the book to be dedicated to him, although he had commissioned its wr iting. The author is gratified to be able to remedy these necessary omissions, thirty-three years after the events.)

To enable them, in their corporate capacities, to receive grants of lands; and, so far, is against the laws of mortmain. 3. To make alien subscribers capable of holding lands; and so far is against the laws of alienage. 4. To transmit these lands, on the death of a proprietor, to a certain line of successors; and so far, changes the course of descents. 5. To put the lands out of the reach of forfeiture, or escheat; and so far, is against the laws of forfeiture and escheat. 6. To transmit personal chattels to successors, in a certain line; and so far, is against the laws of distribution. 7. To give them the sole and exclusive right of banking, under the national authority; and, so far, is against the laws of monopoly. 8. To communicate to them a power to make laws, paramount to the laws of the states; for so they must be construed, to protect the institution from the control of the state legislat ures; and so probably they will be construed.

To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition. The incorporation of a bank, and the powers assumed by this bill, have not, in my opinion, been delegated to the United States by the Constitution.

Warburg1 On the night of November 22, 1910 , a group of newspaper reporters stood disconsolately in the railway station at Hoboken, New Jersey. They had just watched a delega tion of the nation’s leading financiers leave the station on a se cret mission. It would be years before they discovered what that mission was, and even then they would not understand that the history of the United States underwent a drastic change after that night in Hoboken. The delegation had left in a sealed railway car, with blinds drawn, for an undisclosed destination. T hey were led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, head of the National Monetary Commission. President Theodore Roosevelt had signed into law the bill creating the National Monetary Commission in 1908, after the tragic Panic of 1907 had resulted in a public outcry that the nation’s monetary system be stabilized. Aldric h had led the members of the Commission on a two-year tour of Europe, spending some three hundred thousand dollars of publ ic money. He had not yet made a report on the results of this trip, nor had he offered any plan for banking reform. Accompanying Senator Aldrich at the Hoboken station were his private secretary, Shelton; A. Pi att Andrew, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Special Assist ant of the National Monetary Commission; Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank of New York, Henry P. Davison, senior partner of J.P. Morgan Company, and generally regarded as Morgan’s personal emissary; and Charles D. Norton, president of the Morgan-dominated First National Bank of New York. Joinin g the group just before the train left the station were Benjamin Stro ng, also known as a lieutenant of J.P. Morgan; and Paul Warburg, a recent immigrant from Germany who had joined the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb __________________________ 1 Prof. Nathaniel Wright Stephens on, Paul Warburg’s Memorandum, Nelson Aldrich A Leader in Americ an Politics, Scribners, N.Y. 1930"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 1 and Company, New York as a partner earning five hundred thousand dollars a year. Six years later, a financial writer named Bertie Charles Forbes (who later founded the Forbes Magazi ne; the present editor, Malcom Forbes, is his son), wrote: \"Picture a party of the nation’s greatest bankers stealing out of New York on a private ra ilroad car under cover of darkness, stealthily hieing hundred of miles South, embarking on a mysteriouslaunch, sneaking onto an island deserted by all but a few servants, livin g there a full week under such rigid secrecy that the names of not one of them was once mentioned lest the servants learn the identity and disclose to the world this strangest, most se cret expedition in the history of American finance.

Warburg is the link that binds the Aldrich system and the present system together. He more than any one man has made the system possible as a working reality.\"2 The official biography of Senator Nelson Aldrich states: \"In the autumn of 1910, six men went out to shoot ducks, Aldrich, his secretary Shelton, Andrews, Davison, Vanderlip and Warburg.

Morgan during the settling of the Money Panic of 1907. Another Morgan partner, T.W. Lamont, says: \"Henry P. Davison served as arbi trator of the Jekyll Island expedition.\"4 __________________________ 2 \"CURRENT OPINION\", December, 1916, p. 382. 3 Nathaniel Wright Stephenson, Nelson W. Aldrich, A Leader in American Politics, Scribners, N.Y. 1930, Chap. XXIV \"Jekyll Island\" 4 T.W. Lamont, Henry P. Davison, Harper, 1933 2 From these references, it is possib le to piece together the story. Aldrich’s private car, which had left Hoboken station with its shades drawn, had taken the financiers to Jekyll Island, Georgia. Some years earlier, a very exclusive gr oup of millionaires, led by J.P. Morgan, had purchased the island as a winter retreat. They called themselves the Jekyll Island Hunt Cl ub, and, at first, the island was used only for hunting expeditions, un til the millionaires realized that its pleasant climate offered a warm retreat from the rigors of winters in New York, and began to build splendid mansions, which they called \"cottages\", for their famili es’ winter vacations. The club building itself, being quite isolated, was sometimes in demand for stag parties and other pursuits unrelated to hunting. On such occasions, the club members who we re not invited to these specific outings were asked not to appear there for a certain number of days. Before Nelson Aldrich’s party had left New York, the club’s members had been notified that the club would be occupied for the next two weeks. The Jekyll Island Club was chosen as the place to draft the plan for control of the money and credit of the people of the United States, not only because of its isolation, but also because it was the private preserve of the people who were drafting the plan. The New York Times later noted, on May 3, 1931 , in commenting on the death of George F. Baker, one of J.P. Morgan ’s closest associates, that \"Jekyll"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 Island Club has lost one of its mo st distinguished members. One-sixth of the total wealth of the world was represented by the members of the Jekyll Island Club.\" Membership was by inheritance only. The Aldrich group had no interest in hunting. Jekyll Island was chosen for the site of the preparat ion of the central bank because it offered complete privacy, and because there was not a journalist within fifty miles. Such was the need for secrecy that the members of the party agreed, before arriving at Jekyll Island, that no last names would be used at any time during their two week stay. The group later referred to themselves as the First Name Club, as the last names of Warburg, Strong, Vanderlip and the others were prohibited during their stay. T he customary attendants had been given two week vacations from th e club, and new servants brought in from the mainland for this occasion who did not know the names of any of those present. Even if they had been interrogated after the Aldrich party went back to New York, they could not have given the names. This arrangement proved to be so satisfactory that the members, limited to thos e who had actually been present at Jekyll Island, later had a number of informal get-togethers in New York. Why all this secrecy? Why this thousand mile trip in a closed railway car to a remote hunting club? Os tensibly, it was to carry out a program of public service, to pr epare banking reform which would be a boon to the people of t he United States, which had been ordered by the National Monetary Commission. The participants were no strangers to public benefactions. Usually, their names we re inscribed on brass plaques, or on the exteriors of buildings which they had donated. This was not the procedure which they followed at Jekyll Island. No brass plaque was ever erected to mark the selfless actions of those who met at their private hunt club in 1910 to improve the lot of every citizen of the United States. In fact, no benefaction took pl ace at Jekyll Island. The Aldrich group journeyed there in private to write the banking and currency legislation which the National Monetary Commission had been ordered to prepare in public. At stake was the future control of the money and credit of the United States. If any genuine monetary reform had been prepared and presented to Congress, it would"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 have ended the power of the elitist one world money creators. Jekyll Island ensured that a centra l bank would be established in the United States which would give these bankers everything they had always wanted. As the most technically proficient of those present, Paul Warburg was charged with doing most of t he drafting of the plan. His work would then be discussed and gone over by the rest of the group. Senator Nelson Aldrich was there to see that the completed plan would come out in a form which he could get passed by Congress, and the other bankers were there to include whatever details would be needed to be certain th at they got everything they wanted, in a finished draft compos ed during a onetime stay. After they returned to New York, there could be no second get together to rework their plan. They could not hope to obtain such secrecy for their work on a second journey. The Jekyll Island group remained at the club for nine days, working furiously to complete their task. Despite the common interests of those present, the work did not proceed without friction. Senator Aldrich, always a domineering person, considered himself the chosen leader of the group, and could not help ordering everyone else about. Aldrich also felt so mewhat out of place as the only member who was not a professional banker. He had had substantial banking interests throughout his career, but only as a person who profited from his ownersh ip of bank stock. He knew little about the technical aspects of fi nancial operations. His opposite number, Paul Warburg, believed that every question raised by the group demanded, not merely an answer, but a lecture. He rarely lost an opportunity to give the members a long discourse designed to impress them with the extent of his knowledge of banking. This was resented by the others, and often drew barbed remarks from Aldrich. The natural diplomacy of H enry P. Davison proved to be the catalyst which kept them at th eir work. Warburg’s thick alien accent grated on them, and consta ntly reminded them that they had to accept his presence if a central bank plan was to be devised which would guarantee them their future pro- 4 fits. Warburg made little effort to smooth over their prejudices, and contested them on every possible occasion on technical banking questions, which he considered his private preserve."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 1 8 \"In all conspiracies there must be great secrecy.\"5 The \"monetary reform\" plan prepared at Jekyll Island was to be presented to Congress as the completed work of the National Monetary Commission. It was imperative that the real authors of the bill remain hidden. So great wa s popular resentment against bankers since the Panic of 1907 that no Congressman would dare to vote for a bill bearing the Wall Street taint, no matter who had contributed to his campaign expens es. The Jekyll Island plan was a central bank plan, and in this coun try there was a long tradition of struggle against inflicti ng a central bank on the American people. It had begun with Thomas Jefferson’s fight against Alexander Hamilton’s scheme for the First Bank of the United States, backed by James Rothschild. It had continued with President Andrew Jackson’s successful war against Alexander Hamilton’s scheme for the Second Bank of the United States, in which Nicholas Biddle was acting as the agent for James Rothschild of Paris. The result of that struggle was the creation of the Independent Sub-Treasury System, which supposedly had served to keep the funds of the United States out of the hands of the financiers. A study of the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907 indicates that these panics were the result of the international bankers’ operations in London. The public was demanding in 1908 that Congress en act legislation to prevent the recurrence of artificially indu ced money panics. Such monetary reform now seemed inevitable. It was to head off and control such reform that the National Monetary Commission had been set up with Nelson Aldrich at its head, si nce he was majority leader of the Senate. The main problem, as Paul Warbur g informed his colleagues, was to avoid the name \"Central Bank\". For that reason, he had decided upon the designation of \"Federal Reserve System\". This would deceive the people into thinki ng it was not a central bank. However, the Jekyll Island plan would be a central bank plan, fulfilling the main functions of a central bank; it would be owned by private individuals who would profit from ownership of shares. As a bank of issue, it would control the nation’s money and credit. In the chapter on Jekyll Island in his biography of Aldrich, Stephenson writes of the conference: \"How was the Reserve Bank to be controlled? It must be controlled by Congress. The government"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 was to be represented in the board of directors, it was to have full knowledge of all the Bank’s, affairs, but a majority __________________________ 5 Clarendon, Hist. Reb. 1647 5 of the directors were to be chosen , directly or indirectly, by the banks of the association.\"6 Thus the proposed Federal Reserve Bank was to be \"controlled by Congress\" and answerable to the government, but the majority of the directors were to be chosen, \"d irectly or indirectly\" by the banks of the association. In the final refinement of Warburg’s plan, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors would be appointed by the President of the United States, but the real work of the Board would be controlled by a Federal Advisory Council, meeting with the Governors. The Council would be chosen by the directors of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, and would remain unknown to the public. The next consideration was to conc eal the fact that the proposed \"Federal Reserve System\" would be dominated by the masters of the New York money market. The Congressmen from the South and the West could not survive if they voted for a Wall Street plan. Farmers and small businessmen in those areas had suffered most from the money panics. There had been great popular resentment against the Eastern bankers, wh ich during the nineteenth century became a political movement known as \"populism\". The private papers of Nicholas Biddle, not released until more than a century after his death, show that quite early on the Eastern bankers were fully aware of the widespread public opposition to them. Paul Warburg advanced at Jekyll Island the primary deception which would prevent the citizens fr om recognizing that his plan set up a central bank. This was t he regional reserve system. He proposed a system of four (later twelve) branch reserve banks located in different sections of t he country.

Senator Nelson Aldric h had insisted that the officials should be appointive, not elected, and that Congress should have no role in their selection. His Ca pitol Hill experience had taught him that congressional opinion would oft en be inimical to the Wall Street interests, as Congressmen from the West and South might wish to demonstrate to their constituents th at they were protecting them against the Eastern bankers. Warburg responded that the administ rators of the proposed central banks should be subject to executiv e approval by the President. This patent removal of the system fr om Congressional control meant that the __________________________ 6 Nathaniel Wright Stephenson, Nelson W. Aldrich, A Leader in American Politics, Scribners, N.Y. 1930, Chap. XXIV \"Jekyll Island\" p. 379 6 Federal Reserve proposal was uncons titutional from its inception, because the Federal Reserve System was to be a bank of issue. Article 1, Sec. 8, Pa r. 5 of the Constituti on expressly charges Congress with \"the power to co in money and regulate the value thereof.\". Warburg’s plan would depr ive Congress of its sovereignty, and the systems of checks and balances of power set up by Thomas Jefferson in the Constitution would now be destroyed. Administrators of the proposed sy stem would control the nation’s money and credit, and would themselves be approved by the executive department of the gove rnment. The judicial department (the Supreme Court, etc.) was already virtually controlled by the executive department through pr esidential appointment to the bench. Paul Warburg later wrote a massiv e exposition of his plan, The Federal Reserve System, Its Origin and Growth7 of some 1750 pages, but the name \"Jekyll Island\" appear s nowhere in this text. He does state (Vol. 1, p. 58): \"But then the conference closed, after a week of earnest deliberation, the rough draft of what later"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 became the Aldrich Bill had been agreed upon, and a plan had been outlined which provided for a ‘National Reserve Association,’ meaning a central reserve organization with an elastic note issue based on gold and commercial paper.\" On page 60, Warburg writes, \"The results of the conference were entirely confidential. Even the fact there had been a meeting was not permitted to become public.\" He adds in a footnote, \"Though eighteen [sic] years have since gone by, I do not feel free to give a description of this most intere sting conference concerning which Senator Aldrich pledged all participants to secrecy.\" B.C. Forbes’ revelation8 of the secr et expedition to Jekyll Island, had had surprisingly little impact. It did not appear in print until two years after the Federal Reserve Act had been passed by Congress, hence it was never read during the period when it could have had an effect, that __________________________ 7 Paul Warburg, The Federal Reserv e System, Its Origin and Growth, Volume I, p. 58, Macmillan, New York, 1930 8 CURRENT OPINION, December, 1916, p. 382 7 is, during the Congressional debate on the bill. Forbes’ story was also dismissed, by those \"in the know,\" as preposterous, and a mere invention. Stephenson m entions this on page 484 of his book about Aldrich.9 \"This curious episode of Jekyll Isla nd has been generally regarded as a myth. B.C. Forbes got some information from one of the reporters. It told in vague outline the Jekyll Island story, but made no impression and was gener ally regarded as a mere yarn.\" The coverup of the Jekyll Island conference proceeded along two lines, both of which were succe ssful. The first, as Stephenson mentions, was to dismiss the entire story as a romantic concoction which never actually took plac e. Although there were brief references to Jekyll Island in la ter books concerning the Federal"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 Reserve System, these also attracted little public attention. As we have noted, Warburg’s massive an d supposedly definite work on the Federal Reserve System does not mention Jekyll Island at all, although he does admit that a conference took place. In none of his voluminous speeches or writings do the words \"Jekyll Island\" appear, with a single notable exception. He agreed to Professor Stephenson’s request that he prepare a brief statement for the Aldrich biography. This appears on page 485 as part of \"The Warburg Memorandum\". In this excerpt, Warburg writes, \"The matter of a uniform discount rate was discussed and settled at Jekyll Island.\" Another member of the \"First Name Club\" was less reticent. Frank Vanderlip later published a few brief references to the conference. In the Saturday Evening Post, Feb ruary 9, 1935, p. 25, Vanderlip wrote: \"Despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the affairs of corporations, there was an occasion near t he close of 1910, when I was as secretive, indeed, as furtive, as any conspirator. . . . Since it would ha ve been fatal to Senator Aldrich’s plan to have it known that he was calling on anybody from Wall Street to help him in preparing his bill, precautions were taken that would have delighted the heart of James Stillman (a colorful and secretive banker who was President of the National City Bank during the Spanish-American War, and who was thought to have been involved in getting us into that war) . . . I do no t feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedi tion to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.\" In a Travel feature in The Washington Post, March 27, 1983, \"Follow The Rich to Jekyll Isla nd\", Roy Hoopes writes: \"In 1910, when Aldrich and four financial experts wanted a place to meet in secret to reform the country’s banking system, they faked a hunting trip to Jekyll and for 10 days holed up in the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 Clubhouse, where they made pl ans for what eventually would become the Federal Reserve Bank.\" __________________________ 9 Nathaniel Wright Stephenson, Nelson W.

The essential points of the Aldrich Plan were all contained in the Federal Reserve Act as it was passed.\" Professor E.R.A. Seligman, a memb er of the international banking family of J. & W. Seligman, and head of the Department of Economics at Columbia University, wrote in an essay published by the Academy of Political Science, Proceedings, v. 4, No. 4, p. 387- 90: \"It is known to a very few how great is the indebtedness of the United States to Mr. Warburg. For it may be said without fear of co ntradiction that in its fundamental features the Federal Reserve Act is the work of Mr. Warburg more than any other man in the country. The existence of a Federal Reserve Board creates, in everything but in name, a real central bank. In the two fundamentals of command of reserv es and of a discount policy, the Federal Reserve Act has frankly accepted the principle of the Aldrich Bill, and these principles, as has been stated, were the creation of Mr. Warburg and Mr. Warburg alone.

In formulating his plan s and in advancing in them slightly varying suggestions from time to time, it was incumbent on him to remember that the education of the country must be gradual and that a large part of the task was to break down prejudices and remove suspicion. His plans therefore contained all sorts of elaborate suggestions desig ned to guard the public against fancied dangers and to persuade the country that the general scheme was at all practicable. It was the hope of Mr. Warburg that with the lapse of time it might be possible to eliminate from the law a few clauses which were inserted largely at his suggestion for educational purposes.\" Now that the public debt of the United States has passed a trillion dollars, we may indeed admit \"how great is the indebtedness of the United States to Mr. Warburg.\" At the time he wrote the Federal Reserve Act, the public debt was almost nonexistent. Professor Seligman points out Warburg’s remarkable prescience that the real task of the members of the Jekyll Island conference was to prepare a banking plan which would gradually \"educate the country\" and \"break down prejudices and remove suspicion\". The campaign to enact the plan in to law succeeded in doing just that. __________________________ 10 Frank Vanderlip, From Farmboy to Financier 9 "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 CHAPTER TWO The Aldrich Plan \"Finance and the tariff are reserved by Nelson Aldrich as falling within his sole purview and jurisdiction. Mr. Aldrich is endeavoring to devise, through the National Mo netary Commission, a banking and currency law.

Ernest Newman recently sa id, ‘What the South visits on the Negro in a political way, Aldrich wo uld mete out to the mudsills of the North, if he could devise a safe and practical way to accomplish it.’\"--Harper’s Weekly, May 7, 1910.\" The participants in the Jekyll Is land conference returned to New York to direct a nationwide prop aganda campaign in favor of the \"Aldrich Plan\". Three of the leadin g universities, Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Chicago, were used as the rallying points for this propaganda, and national banks had to contribute to a fund of five million dollars to persuade the American pu blic that this central bank plan should be enact ed into law by Congress. Woodrow Wilson, governor of New Jersey and former president of Princeton University, was enlisted as a spokesman for the Aldrich Plan. During the Panic of 1907, Wils on had declared, \"All this trouble could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven public-spirited men like J.P.

Much of the five million dollars of the bankers slush fund was spent under the auspices of the National Citizens’ League, which was made up of college professors. The two most tireless propagandists for the Aldrich Plan were Professo r O.M. Sprague of Harvard, and J. Laurence Laughlin of the University of Chicago. Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., notes: \"J. Laurence Laughlin, Chairman of the Executive Co mmittee of the National Citizens’ League since its organization , has returned to his position as professor of political economics in the University of Chicago. In June, 1911, Professor Laughlin was given a year’s leave from the university, that he might give all of his time to the campaign of education undertak en by the League . . . He has worked indefatigably, and it is largely due to his efforts and his persistence that the campaign enter s the final stage with flattering prospects of a successful outcome . . . The reader knows that the University of Chicago is an institution endowed by John D. Rockefeller, with nearly fifty million dollars.\"12 In his biography of Nelson Aldr ich, Stephenson reveals that the Citizens’ League was also a Jekyll Island product. In chapter 24 we find that: The Aldrich Plan was repr esented to Congress as the result of three years of work, study and tr avel by members of the National Monetary Commission, with expenditures of more than three hundred thousand dollars.* Testifying before the Committee on Rules, December 15, 1911, after the Aldrich plan had been introd uced in Congress, Congressman Lindbergh stated, \"Our financial system is a fals e one and a huge burden on the people . . .

Instead, a panic entailed enormous losses upon us. Wall Street knew the American people were demanding a remedy against the recurrence of such a ri diculously unnatural condition. Most Senators and Representatives fe ll into the Wall Street trap and passed the Aldrich Vreeland Emergency Currency Bill. But the real purpose was to get a monetary commission which would frame a proposition for amendments to our currency and banking laws which would suit the Money Trust. The interests are now busy everywhere educating the people in favor of the Aldrich Plan. It is reported that a large sum of mo ney has been raised for this purpose. Wall Street speculation brought on the Panic of 1907. The depositors’ funds were loaned to gamblers and anybody the Money Trust wanted to favour. Then when the depositors wanted their money, the banks did not have it. That made the panic.\" Edward Vreeland, co-author of the bill, wrote in the August 25, 1910 Independent (which was owned by Aldrich), \"Under the proposed monetary plan of Senator Aldrich, monopolies will disappear, because they will not be able to make more than four percent interest and monopolies cannot continue at such a low rate. Also, this will mark the disappearance of the Government from the banking business.\""},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 2 8 Vreeland’s fantastic claims were typical of the propaganda flood unleashed to pass the Aldrich Plan. Monopolies would disappear, the Government would disappear from the banking business. Pie in the sky. Nation Magazine, Janu ary 19, 1911, noted, \"The name of Central Bank is carefully avoided, but the ‘Federal Reserve Association’, the name given to the proposed central organization, is endowed with the usual powers and responsibiliti es of a European Central Bank.\" After the National Monetary Commission had returned from Europe, it held no official meetings for nearly two years. No records or minutes were ever presented showing who had authored the Aldrich Plan. Since they held no of ficial meetings, the members of the commission could hardly claim th e Plan as their own. The sole tangible result of the Commission ’s three hundred thousand dollar expenditure was a library of thir ty massive volumes on European banking. Typical of these works is a thousand page history of the Reichsbank, the central bank whic h controlled money and credit in Germany, and whose principal stockholders, were the Rothschilds and Paul Warburg’s family banking house of M.M. Warburg Company. The Commission’s records show that it never functioned as a deliberative body. Indeed, its only \"meeting\" was the secret conference held at Jekyll Island , and this conference is not mentioned in any publication of the Commission. Senator Cummins passed a resolution in Congress orde ring the Commission to report on January 8, 1912, and show some constructive results of its three years’ work. In the face of this challenge, the National Monetary Commission ceased to exist. 12 With their five million dollars as a war chest, the Aldrich Plan propagandists waged a no-hol ds barred war against their opposition. Andrew Frame testifie d before the House Banking and Currency Committee of the Americ an Bankers Association. He represented a group of Western bankers who opposed the Aldrich Plan: CHAIRMAN CARTER GLASS: \"Why didn’t the Western bankers make themselves heard when the American Bankers Association gave its unqualified and, we are assure d, unanimous approval of the scheme proposed by the Nati onal Monetary Commission?\""},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 ANDREW FRAME: \"I’m glad you called my attention to that.

KINDRED: \"But the report was given out that it was practically unanimous.\" ANDREW FRAME: \"The bill had already been prepared by Senator Aldrich and presented to the executive council of the American Bankers Association in May, 1911.

Chairman Glass then called as witness one of the ten most powerful bankers in the United States, Ge orge Blumenthal, partner of the international banking house of Laza rd Freres and brother-in-law of Eugene Meyer, Jr. Carter Glass e ffusively welcomed Blumenthal, stating that \"Senator O’Gorman of New York was kind enough to suggest your name to us.\" A year later, O’Gorman prevented a Senate Committee from asking his master, Paul Warburg, any embarrassing questions before approv ing his nomination as the first Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. George Blumenthal stated, \"Since 1893 my firm of Lazard Freres has been foremost in import ations and exportations of gold and has thereby come into contact with everybody who had anything to do with it.\" Congressman Taylor asked, \"Have you a statement there as to the part you have had in the import ation of gold into the United States?\" Taylor asked this because the Panic of 1893 is known to economists as a classic example of a money panic caused by gold movements. \"No,\" replied George Blumenthal, \"I have nothing at all on that, because it is not bearing on the question.\" A banker from Philadelphia, Leslie Shaw, dissented with other witnesses at these hearings, criticizing the much vaunted \"decentralization\" of the System. He said, \"Under the Aldrich Plan the bankers are to have loca l associations and district associations, and when you have a local organizati on, the centered control is assured. Suppose we have a local association in Indianapolis; can you not name the three men who will dominate that association? And then can you not name the one man everywhere else. When you have hooked the banks toget her, they can have the biggest influence of anything in this country, with the exception of the newspapers.\" To promote the Democratic currency bill, Carter Glass made public the sorry record of the Republican efforts of Senator Aldrich’s National Monetary Commission. Hi s House Report in 1913 said, \"Senator MacVeagh fixes the co st of the National Monetary Commission to May 12, 1911 at $2 07,130. They have since spent another hundred thousand dollars of the taxpayer’s money. The"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 work done at such cost cannot be ignored, but, having examined the extensive literature published by the Commission, the Banking and Currency Committee finds little that bears upon the present state of the credit market of the United States. We object to the Aldrich Bill on the following points: 14 Its entire lack of adequate government or public control of the banking mechanism it sets up. Its tendency to throw voting cont rol into the hands of the large banks of the system. The extreme danger of inflation of currency inherent in the system. The insincerity of the bond-fundi ng plan provided for by the measure, there being a barefaced pr etense that this system was to cost the government nothing. The dangerous monopolistic aspects of the bill. Our Committee at the outs et of its work was me t by a well-defined sentiment in favor of a centra l bank which was the manifest outgrowth of the work that had been done by the National Monetary Commission.\" Glass’s denunciation of the Aldr ich Bill as a central bank plan ignored the fact that his own Federal Reserve Act would fulfill all the functions of a central bank. Its stock would be owned by private stockholders who could use the credit of the Government for their own profit; it would have control of the nation’s money and credit resources; and it would be a bank of issue which would finance the government by \"mobilizing\" credit in time of war. In \"The Rationale of Central Banking,\" Vera C. Smith (Committee for Monetary Research and Education, June, 1981) writes, \"The primary definition of a central bank is a banking system in which a single bank has either a complete or residuary monopoly in the note issue. A central bank is not a natural product of banking development. It is imposed from outside or comes into being as t he result of Government favors.\" Thus a central bank attains its commanding position from its government granted monopo ly of the note issue.

This Act establishes t he most gigantic trust on earth.\"-- Congressman Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Sr. The speeches of Senator LaFollette and Congressman Lindbergh became rallying points of opposition to the Aldrich Plan in 1912. They also aroused popular feel ing against the Money Trust. Congressman Lindbergh said, on December 15, 1911, \"The government prosecutes other trusts , but supports the money trust. I have been waiting patiently for seve ral years for an opportunity to expose the false money standard, an d to show that the greatest of all favoritism is that extended by the government to the money trust.\" Senator LaFollette publicly charged that a money trust of fifty men controlled the United States. George F. Baker, partner of J.P. Morgan, on being queried by reporters as to the truth of the charge, replied that it was absolutely in error. He sa id that he knew from personal knowledge that not more than eight men ran this country. The Nation Magazine replied editorially to Senator LaFollette that \"If there is a Money Trust, it will not be practical to establish that it exercises its influence either for good or for bad.\" Senator LaFollette remarks in his me moirs that his speech against the Money Trust later cost him the Pres idency of the United States, just as Woodrow Wilson’s early support of the Aldrich Plan had brought him into consideration for that office. Congress finally made a gesture to appease popular feeling by appointing a committee to invest igate the control of money and credit in the United States. This was the Pujo Committee , a subcommittee of the House Bank ing and Currency Committee, which conducted the famous \"Money Trust\" hearings in 1912, under the leadership of Congressman Ars ene Pujo of Louisiana, who was regarded as a spokesman for the oi l interests. These hearings were deliberately dragged on for five months, and resulted in six- thousand pages of printed testimon y in four volumes. Month after month, the bankers made the train trip from New York to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 Washington, testified before the Committee and returned to New York. The hearings were extremely dull, and no startling information turned up at these sessions. The bankers solemnly admitted that they 16 were indeed bankers, insisted th at they always operated in the public interest, and claimed that they were animated only by the highest ideals of public service, like the Congressmen before whom they were testifying. The paradoxical nature of the Pujo Money Trust Hearings may better be understood if we examine t he man who single-handedly carried on these hearings, Samuel Untermye r. He was one of the principal contributors to Woodrow Wilson’s Presidential campaign fund, and was one of the wealthiest corpor ation lawyers in New York. He states in his autobiography in \"W ho’s Who\" of 1926 that he once received a $775,000 fee for a single legal transaction, the successful merger of the Utah Copper Company and the Boston Consolidated and Nevada Company, a firm with a market value of one hundred million dollars. He refused to as k either Senator LaFollette or Congressman Lindbergh to testify in the investigat ion which they alone had forced Congress to hold. As Special Counsel for the Pujo Committee, Untermyer ran the hearings as a one-man operation. The Congressional members, incl uding its chairman, Congressman Arsene Pujo, seemed to have been struck dumb from the commencement of the hearings to their conclusion. One of these silent servants of the public was Congressman James Byrnes, of South Carolina, representing Bernar d Baruch’s home district, who later achieved fame as \"Baruch’s man\", and was placed by Baruch in charge of the Office of War Mobilization during the Second World War. Although he was a specialist in such matters, Untermyer did not ask any of the bankers about the system of interlocking directorates through which they controlled in dustry. He did not go into international gold movements, wh ich were known as a factor in money panics, or the internationa l relationships between American bankers and European bankers. The international banking houses of Eugene Meyer, Lazard Freres, J. & W. Seligman, Ladenburg Thalmann, Speyer Brothers, M. M. Warburg, and the Rothschild Brothers did not arouse Samuel Unte rmyer’s curiosity, although it was well known in the New York fi nancial world that all of these"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 family banking houses either had branches or controlled subsidiary houses in Wall Street. When Jacob Schiff appeared before the Pujo Committee, Mr. Untermyer’s adroit questioning allowed Mr. Schiff to talk for many minutes without re vealing any information about the operations of the banking house of Kuhn Loeb Company, of which he was senior partner, and whic h Senator Robert L. Owen had identified as the repres entative of the European Rothschilds in the United States. The aging J.P. Morgan, who had only a few more months to live, appeared before the Committ ee to justify his decades of international financial deals. He stated for Mr. Untermyer’s edification that \"Money is a commodity.\" This was a favorite ploy of the money creators, as they wished to make the public believe that the creation of money was a natural occur 17 rence akin to the growing of a field of corn, although it was actually a bounty conferred upon the bank ers by governments over which they had gained control. J.P. Morgan also told the Pujo Committee that, in making a loan, he seriously considered only one factor, a man’s character; even the man’s ability to repay the loan, or his collateral, were of little importance. This astonishing obse rvation startled even the blasé members of the Committee. The farce of the Pujo Committee end ed without a single well-known opponent of the money creators bein g allowed to appear or testify. As far as Samuel Untermyer was concerned, Senator LaFollette and Congressman Charles Augustus Lindbergh had never existed. Nevertheless, these Congressmen had managed to convince the people of the United States that the New York bankers did have a monopoly on the nation’s money and credit. At the close of the hearings, the bankers and their subsidized newspapers claimed that the only way to break this monopo ly was to enact the banking and currency legislation now being proposed to Congress, a bill which would be passed a year later as the Federal Reserve Act. The press seriously demanded that the New York banking monopoly be broken by turning over the admi nistration of the new banking system to the most knowledgeable banker of them all, Paul Warburg."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 The Presidential campaign of 1912 records one of the more interesting political upsets in American history. The incumbent, William Howard Taft, was a popular president, and the Republicans, in a period of general prosperity , were firmly in control of the government through a Republican majority in both houses. The Democratic challenger, Woodrow Wi lson, Governor of New Jersey, had no national recognition, and was a stiff, austere man who excited little public support. Bo th parties included a monetary reform bill in their platforms: The Republicans were committed to the Aldrich Plan, which had been denounced as a Wall Street plan, and the Democrats had the Federal Reserve Act. Neither party bothered to inform the public that the bills were almost identical except for the names. In retrospect, it seems obvious that the money creators decided to dump Taft and go with Wilson. How do we know this? Taft seemed certai n of reelection, and Wilson would return to obscurity. Suddenly, Theo dore Roosevelt \"threw his hat into the ring.\" He announced that he was running as a third party candidate, the \"Bull Moose\". His candidacy would have been ludicrous had it not been for the fact that he was exceptionally well-financed. Moreover, he was given unlimited press coverage, more than Taft and Wilson combined. As a Republican ex-president, it was obvious that Roosevelt would cut deeply into Taft’s vote. This proved the case, and Wilson won t he election. To this day, no one can say what Theodore Roosevelt’s program was, or why he would sabotage his own party. Since the bankers were financing all three candi- 18 dates, they would win regardless of the outcome. Later Congressional testimony showed that in the firm of Kuhn Loeb Company, Felix Warburg was suppo rting Taft, Paul Warburg and Jacob Schiff were supporting Wilson, and Otto Kahn was supporting Roosevelt. The result was that a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President were elected in 1912 to get the central bank legislation passed. It seems probab le that the identification of the Aldrich Plan as a Wall Street operat ion predicted that it would have a difficult passage through Congress, as the Democrats would solidly oppose it, whereas a su ccessful Democratic candidate, supported by a Democratic Congre ss, would be able to pass the central bank plan. Taft was thro wn overboard because the bankers doubted he could deliver on the Aldrich Plan, and Roosevelt was"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 the instrument of his demise. *The final electoral vote in 1912 was Wilson - 409; Roosevelt - 167; and Taft - 15. To further confuse the American pe ople and blind them to the real purpose of the proposed Federal Reserve Act, the architects of the Aldrich Plan, powerful Nelson Aldric h, although no longer a senator, and Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank, set up a hue and cry against the bill. They gave interviews whenever they could find an audience denouncing the proposed Federal Reserve Act as inimical to banking and to good government. The bugaboo of inflation was raised because of the Act’s pr ovisions for printing Federal Reserve notes. The Nati on, on October 23, 1913, pointed out, \"Mr. Aldrich himself raised a hue and cry over the issue of government \"fiat money\", that is, money issued without gold or bullion back of it, although a bill to do precisely that had been passed in 1908 with his own name as author, and he knew besides, that the ‘government’ had nothing to do with it, that the Federal Reserve Board would have full charge of the issuing of such moneys.\" Frank Vanderlip’s claims were so bizarre that Senator Robert L. Owen, chairman of the newly formed Senate Banking and Currency Committee, which had been formed on March 18, 1913, accused him of openly carrying on a campaign of misrepresentation about the bill. The interests of the public, so Carter Glass claimed in a sp eech on September 10, 1913 to Congress, would be protected by an advisory council of bankers. \"There can be nothing sinister about its transactions. Meeting with it at least four times a year will be a bankers’ advisory council representing every regional reserve district in the system.

One of the critics of the proposed \"decentralized\" system was a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, Alfred Crozier: Crozier was called to testify for the Senate Committee because he had written a provocative book in 1912, U.S. Mo ney vs. Corporation Currency.* He attacked the Aldrich-Vreeland Act of 1908 as a Wall Street instrument, and he pointed out th at when our government had to issue money based on privately owned securities, we were no longer a free nation. Crozier testified befo re the Senate Committee that, \"It should prohibit the granting or calling in of loans for the purpose of influencing quotation prices of securities and the contracting of loans or increasing interest rates in concert by the banks to influence public opinion or the action of any legislative body. Within recent months, William McAdoo, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States was reported in the open press as charging specifically that there was a conspiracy among certain of the large banking interests to put a contraction upon the currency and to raise interest rates for the sake of making the public force Congress into passing currency legislation desired by those interests. The so- called administration currency bill grants just what Wall Street and the big banks for twenty-five years have been striving for, that is, PRIVATE INSTEAD OF PUBLIC CONTROL OF CURRENC Y. It does this as completely as the Aldrich Bill. Both measures rob the government and the people of all effective control over the public’s money, and vest in the banks exclusively the dangerous power to make money among the people scarce or plenty. The Aldrich Bill puts this power in one central bank. The Ad ministration Bill puts it in twelve regional central banks, all owned exclusively by the identical private interests that would have owned and operated the Aldrich Bank. President Garfield shortly before his assassination declared that whoever controls the supply of currency would control the business and activities of the people. Thomas Jefferson warned us a hundred years ago that a pr ivate central bank issuing the public currency was a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.\" It is interesting to note how many assassinations of Presidents of the United States follow their concer n with the issuing of public currency; Lincoln with his Greenba ck, non-interest-bearing notes,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 and Garfield, making a pronouncement on currency problems just before he was assassinated.

The bankers could not wrest control of the issuance of money from the citizens of the United States, to whom it had b een designated through its Congress by the Constitution, un til the Congress granted them their monopoly for a central bank. Therefore, much of the influence exerted to get the Federal Reserve Act passed was done behind the scenes, principally by two shadowy, no n-elected persons: The German immigrant, Paul Warburg, and Co lonel Edward Mandell House of Texas. Paul Warburg made an appearance before the House Banking and Currency Committee in 1913, in which he briefly stated his background: \"I am a member of the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company. I came over to this country in 1902, having been born and educated in the banking bu siness in Hamburg, Germany, and studied banking in London and Paris, and have gone all around the world. In the Panic of 1907, the first suggestion I made was ‘Let us get a national clearing house.’ The Aldrich Plan contains some things which are simply fundamental rules of banking. Your aim in this plan (the Owen-Glass bill) mu st be the same--centralizing of reserves, mobilizing commercial credit, and getting an elastic note issue.\" Warburg’s phrase, \"mobilization of credit\" was an important one, because the First World War was due to begin shortly, and the first task of the Federal Reserve System would be to finance the World War. The European nations were already bankrupt, because they had maintained large standing ar mies for almost fifty years, a situation created by their own c entral banks, and therefore they"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 could not finance a war. A c entral bank always imposes a tremendous burden on the nation for \"rearmament\" and \"defense\", in order to create inextinguishable debt, simultaneously creating a military dictatorship and enslaving the people to pay the \"interest\" on the debt which the bankers have artificially created. In the Senate debate on the Federal Reserve Act, Senator Stone said on December 12, 1913, \"The great banks for years have sought to have and control agents in the Treasury to serve their purposes. Let me quote from this World articl e, ‘Just as soon as Mr. McAdoo came to Washington, a woman whom the National City Bank had installed in the Treasury Department to get advance information on the condition of banks, and other ma tters of interest to the big Wall Street group, was removed. Immediately the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary, John Skelton Williams, were criticized severely by the agents of the Wall Street group.’\" \"I myself have known more than one occasion when bankers refused credit to men who opposed their political views and purposes. When Senator Aldrich and others were going around the country exploiting this scheme, the big banks of New York and Chicago were engaged in 21 raising a munificent fund to bols ter up the Aldrich propaganda. I have been told by bankers of my own state that contributions to this exploitation fund had been demanded of them and that they had contributed because they were af raid of being blacklisted or boycotted. There are bankers of this coun try who are enemies of the public welfare. In the past, a few great banks have followed policies and projects that have pa ralyzed the industrial energies of the country to perpetuate their tremendous power over the financial and business industries of America.\" Carter Glass states in his autobiography that he was summoned by Woodrow Wilson to the White House, and that Wilson told him he intended to make the reserve notes obligations of the United States. Glass says, \"I was for an instant speechless. I remonstrated. There is not any government obligation here, Mr. President. Wilson said he had had to compromise on this po int in order to save the bill.\" The term \"compromise\" on this point came directly from Paul Warburg. Col. Elisha Ely Garrison, in Roosevelt,* Wilson and the Federal Reserve Law wrote, \"In 1911, Lawrence Abbot, Mr."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 Roosevelt’s private officer at ‘T he Outlook’ handed me a copy of the so-called Aldrich Plan for currency reform. I said, I could not believe that Mr. Warburg was the author. This plan is nothing more than the Aldrich-Vreeland legi slation which provided for currency issue against securities. Warburg kn ows that as well as I do. I am going to see him at once and ask him about it. All right, the truth. Yes, I wrote it, he said. Why? I asked. It was a compromise, answered Warburg.\"13 Garrison says that Warburg wrote him on February 8, 1912. \"I have no doubt that at the end of a thorough discussion, either you will see it my way or I will see it yours--but I hope you will see it mine.\" This was another famous Warburg saying when he secretly lobbied Congressmen to support his interest , the veiled threat that they should \"see it his way\". Those who did not found large sums contributed to their opponents at the next elections, and usually went down in defeat. Col. Garrison, an agent of Brown Brothers bankers, later Brown Brothers Harriman, had entree everywhere in the financial community. He writes of Col. House, \"Col. House agreed entirely with the early writing of Mr. Warburg.\" Page 337, he quotes Col. House: \"I am also suggesting that the Central Board be increased from four members to five and their terms lengthened from eight to ten years. This would give stability and wo uld take away the power of a President to change the personnel of the board during a single term of office.\" __________________________ * Theodore Roosevelt 13 Elisha Ely Garrison, Roosevelt, Wilson and the Federal Reserve Law, Christopher Publications, Boston, 1931 22 House’s phrase, \"take away the powe r of a President\" is significant, because later Presidents found themselves helpless to change the direction of the government beca use they did not have the power to change the composition of the Federal Reserve Board to attain a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 majority on it during that President’s term of office. Garrison also wrote in this book, \"Paul Warburg is the man who got the Federal Reserve Act together after the Aldrich Plan aroused such nationwide resentment and opposition. The mastermind of both plans was Baron Alfred Rothschild of London.\" Colonel Edward Mandell House* was referred to by Rabbi Stephen Wise in his autobiography, Cha llenging Years as \"the unofficial Secretary of State\". House noted th at he and Wilson knew that in passing the Federal Reserve Act, they had created an instrument more powerful than the Supreme Court. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors actually comprised a Supreme Court of Finance, and there was no appeal from any of their rulings. In 1911, prior to Wilson’s taking office as President, House had returned to his home in Texas an d completed a book called Philip Dru, Administrator. Ostensibly a no vel, it was actually a detailed plan for the future go vernment of the United States, \"which would establish Socialism as dreamed by Karl Marx\", according to House. This \"novel\" predicted the enactment of the graduated income tax, excess profits tax, unemployment insurance, social security, and a flexible currency system. In short, it was the blueprint which was later followed by the Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt administrations. It was published \"anonymously\" by B. W. Huebsch of New York, and widely circulated among government officials, who were left in no doubt as to its authorship. George Sylvester Viereck**, who knew House for years, later wrote an account of the Wilson-House relationship, The Stra ngest Friendship in History.14 In 1955, Westbrook Pegler, the Hearst columnist from 1932 to 1956, heard of the Philip Dru book and called Viereck to ask if he had a copy. Viereck sent Pegler his copy of the book, and Pegler wrote a column about it, stating: \"One of the institutions outlined in Philip Dru is the Federal Reserve System. The Schiffs, the Warburgs, the Kahns, the Rockefellers and Morgans put their faith in House.

The result, that the laws, habits and ethical training in vogue were alike responsible for the inequaliti es in opportunity and the consequent wide difference between the few and the many; that the results of such conditions was to render inefficient a large part of the population, the percentage differing in each country in the ratio that education and enlightenment and unselfish laws bore to ignorance, bigotry and selfish laws.\"15 In his book, House (Dru) envisions himself becoming a dictator and forcing on the people his radical views, page 148: \"They recognized the fact that Dru dominated the situation and that a master mind had at last risen in the Republic .\" He now assumes the title of General. \"General Dru announced his purpose of assuming the powers of a dictator . . . they were assured that he was free from any personal ambition . . . he proc laimed himself ‘Administrator of the Republic.’\"* This pensive dreamer who imagined himself a dictator actually managed to place himself in the posi tion of the confidential advisor to the President of the United Stat es, and then to have many of his desires enacted into law!

House in 1912, is included here to show his totalitarian Marxist philosophy. House was to become for 8 years wi th Wilson, the President’s closest advisor. Later he continued his influe nce in the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. From his home in Magnolia, Mass., House advised FDR through frequent trips of Felix Frankfurter to the White House. Frankfurter was later appointed to the Supreme Court by F.D.R. 24 with many of the same perso nnel, and with House guiding the administration from behind the scenes. Like most of the behind-the-scenes operators in this book, Col. Edward Mandell House had the obligatory \"London connection\". Originally a Dutch fami ly, \"Huis\", his ancestors had lived in England for three hundred years, after which his father settled in Texas, where he made a fortune in blockade -running during the Civil War, shipping cotton and other contraba nd to his British connections, including the Rothschilds, and bringing back supplies for the beleaguered Texans. The senior House, not trusting the volatile Texas situation, prudently deposited a ll his profits from his blockade- running in gold with Baring bankin g house in London*. At the close of the Civil War, he was one of the wealthiest men in Texas. He named his son \"Mandell\" after one of his merchant associates."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 According to Arthur Howden Smit h, when House’s fa ther died in 1880, his estate was distributed am ong his sons as follows: Thomas William got the banking business; John, the sugar plantation; and Edward M. the cotton plantations, which brought him an income of $20,000 a year.16 At the age of twelve, the young Edward Mandell House had brain fever, and was later further crippl ed by sunstroke. He was a semi- invalid, and his ailments gave him an odd Oriental appearance. He never entered any profession, but used his father’s money to become the kingmaker of Texas politics, successively electing five governors from 1893 to 1911. In 1911 he began to support Wilson for president, and threw the crucial Texas delegation to him which ensured his nomination. House met Wi lson for the first time at the Hotel Gotham, May 31, 1912.

The Times buried a brief quote from Congressman Lindbergh that \"the bill would establish the most gigantic trust on earth,\" and quoted Representative Guernsey of Maine, a Republican on the House Banking and Currency Committee, that \"This is an inflation bill, the only question being the extent of the inflation.\" Congressman Lindbergh said on that historic day, to the House: \"This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signs this bill, the invisible government by the Monetary Power will be legalized. The people may not know it immediately, but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed. The trusts will soon realize that they have gone too far even for their own good. The people must make a declaration of independence to relieve themselves from the Monetary Power.

The \"unprecedented speed\" with which the Federal Reserve Act had been passed by Congress during what became known as \"the Christmas massacre\" had one unforeseen aspect. Woodrow Wilson was taken unaware, as he, like many others, had been assured the bill would not come up for a vote until after Christmas. Now he refused to sign it, because he objected to the provisions for the selection of Class B. Directors. William L. White relates in his biography of Bernard Baruch that Baruch, a principal contributor to Wilson’s campaign fund, was stunned when he was informed that Wilson refused to sign the bill. He hurried 28 to the White House and assured Wilson that this was a minor matter, which could be fixed up later through \"administrative processes\". The important thing was to get the Federal Reserve Act signed into law at once. With this reassurance, Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913. Histor y proved that on that day, the Constitution ceased to be the governing covenant of the American people, and our liberties were handed over to a small group of international bankers."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 The December 24, 1913 New York Times carried a front page headline \"WILSON SIGNS THE CURRENCY BILL!\" Below it, also in capital letters, were two further headlines, \"PROSPERITY TO BE FREE\" and \"WILL HELP EVERY CLASS\". Who could object to any law which provided benefits to everyone? The Times described the festive atmosphere while Wilson’s family and government officials watched him sign the bill. \"The Christmas spirit pervaded the gathering,\" exulted The Times. In his biography of Carter Glass, Rixey Smith states that those present at the signing of the bill included Vice President Marshall, Secretary Bryan, Carter Glass, Senator Owen, Secretary McAdoo, Speaker Champ Clark, and other Treasury officials. None of the real writers of the bill, the draftees of Jekyll Island, were present. They had prudently absented themselves from the scene of their victory. Rixey Smith also wrote, \"It was as though Christmas had come two days early.\" On December 24, 1913, Jacob Schi ff wrote to Col. House, \"My dear Col. House. I want to say a word to you for the silent, but no doubt effective work you have done in the interest of currency legislation and to congratulate you that the measure has finally been enacted into law. I am with good wishes, faithfully yours, JACOB SCHIFF.\" Representative Moore of Kansas, in commenting on the passage of the Act, said to the House of Representatives: \"The President of the United States now becomes the absolute dictator of all the finances of the country. He appoints a controlling board of seven men, all of whom belong to his political party, even though it is a minority. The Secretary of the Treasury is to rule supreme whenever there is a difference of opinion between himself and the Federal Reserve Board."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 AND, only one member of the Board is to pass out of office while the President is in office.\" The ten year terms of office of the members of the Board were lengthened by the Banking Act of 1935 to fourteen years, which meant that these directors of the nation’s finances, although not elected by the people, held office longer than three presidents. While Col. House, Jacob Schiff and Paul Warburg basked in the glow of a job well done, the other actors in this drama were subject to later afterthoughts. Woodrow Wilson wrote in 1916, National Economy and the Banking System, Sen. Doc. No. 3, No. 223, 76th Congress, 1st session, 1939: \"Our system of credit is concentrated (in the Federal Reserve 29 System). The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities, are in the hands of a few men.\" When he was asked by Clarence W. Barron whether he approved of the bill as it was finally passed. Warburg remarked, \"Well, it hasn’t got quite everything we want, but the lack can be adjusted later by administrative processes.\" Woodrow Wilson and Carter Glass are given credit for the Act by most contemporary historians, but of all those concerned, Wilson had least to do with Congressional action on the bill. George Creel, a veteran Washington corresponden t, wrote in Harper’s Weekly, June 26, 1915: \"As far as the Democratic Party wa s concerned, Woodrow Wilson was without influence, save for the patronage he possessed. It was Bryan"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 who whipped Congress into line on the tariff bill, on the Panama Canal tolls repeal, and on the currency bill.\" Mr. Bryan later wrote, \"That is the one thing in my public career that I regret--my work to secure the enactment of the Federal Reserve Law.\" On December 25, 1913, The Nation pointed out that \"The New York Stock Market began to rise steadily upon news that the Senate was ready to pass the Federal Reserve Act.\" This belies the claim that the Federal Reserve Act was a monetary reform bill. The New York Stock Exchange is generally considered an accurate barometer of the true meaning of any financial legislation passed in Washington. Senator Aldric h also decided that he no longer had misgivings about the Federal Rese rve Act. In a magazine which he owned, and which he called The In dependent, he wrote in July, 1914: \"Before the passage of this Act, the New York bankers could only dominate the reserves of New York. Now we are able to dominate the bank reserves of the entire country.\" H.W. Loucks denounced the Federal Reserve Act in The Great Conspiracy of the House of Morgan, \"In the Federal Reserve Law, they have wrested from the people and secured for themselves the constitutional power to issue money and regulate the value thereof.\" On page 31, Loucks writes, \"The House of Morgan is now in supreme control of our industry, commerce and political affairs. They are in complete control of th e policy making of the Democratic, Republican and Progressive parties. The present extraordinary propaganda for ‘preparedness’ is planned more for home coercion than for defense against foreign aggression.\"22 The signing of the Federal Reserve Act by Woodrow Wilson represented the culmination"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 of years of collusion with his inti mate friend, Col.

As soon as he obtained the Democratic nomination for President, in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt made a \"pilgrimage\" to Col. House’s home at Magnolia, Mass. Roosevelt, after the Republican hiatus of the 1920s, filled in the goals of Philip Dru, Administrator,23 which Wilson had not been able to carry out. The late Roosevelt achievements included the enactment of the social security program, excess profits tax, and the expansion of the graduated income tax to 90% of earned income. House’s biographer, Charles Seymour, wrote: \"He was wearied by the details of party politics and appointments. Even the share he had taken in constructive domestic legislation (the Federal Reserve Act, tariff revision, and the Income Tax amendment) did not satisfy him. From the beginning of 1914 he gave more and more of his time to what he regarded as the highest form of politics and that for which he was particularly suited--international affairs.\"24 In 1938, shortly before he died, House told Charles Seymour, \"During the last fifteen years I have been close to the center of things, although few people suspect it. No important foreigner has come to the United States without talking to me. I was close to the movement that"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 nominated Roosevelt. He has given me a free hand in advising him. All the Ambassadors have reported to me frequently.\" A comparative print of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 as passed by the House of Representatives and amended by the Senate shows the following striking change: The Senate struck out, \"To suspend the officials of Federal Reserve banks for cause, stated in writing with opportunity of hearing, require the removal of said official for incompetency, dereliction of duty, fraud or deceit, such removal to be subject to approval by the President of the United States.\" This was changed by the Senate to read \"To suspend or remove any officer or director of any Federal Reserve Bank, the cause of such removal to be forthwith communicated in writing by the Federal Reserve Board to the removed officer or director and to said bank.\" This completely altered the conditions under which an officer or director might be removed.

Congressman Wright Patman, leading critic of the System, tried to find out who the stockholders were. The stock in the original twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks was purchased by national banks in those twelve regions. Because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was to set the interest rates and direct open market operations, thus controlling the daily supply and price of money throughout the United States, it is the stockholders of that bank who are the real directors of the entire system. For the first time, it can be revealed who those stockholders are. This writer has the original organization certificates of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, giving the ownership of shares by the national banks in each district. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued 203,053 shares, and, as filed with the Comptroller of the Currency May 19, 1914, the large New York City banks took more than half of the outstanding shares. The Rockefelle r Kuhn, Loeb-controlled National City Bank took the largest number of shares of any bank, 30,000 shares. J.P. Morgan’s First Nati onal Bank took 15,000 shares.

With the setting up of the twelve \"financial districts\" through the Federal Reserve Banks, the traditional division of the United States into the forty- eight states was overthrown, and we entered the era of \"regionalism\", or twelve regions which had no relation to the traditional state boundaries.

This might have meant some questions about the secret conference in Jekyll Island, and Warburg refused to appear. On July 7, 1914 he wrote a le tter to G.M.

It seemed that Warburg was prepared to bluff the Senate Committee into confirming him without any question s asked. On July 10, 1914, The New York Times defended Warburg on the editorial page and denounced the \"Senatorial Inquisition\". Since Warburg had not yet been asked any questions, the term \"Inquisition\" se emed remarkably inappropriate, nor was there any real danger that the Senators were preparing to use instruments of torture on Mr. Warburg. The imbroglio was resolved when the Senate Committee, in abject surrender, agreed that Mr. Warburg would be given a list of questions in advance of his appearance so that he could go over them, and that he could be excused from answering any questions which might tend to impair his service on the Board of Governors.

During the Senate Hearings on Paul Warburg before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, August 1, 1914, Senator Bristow asked, \"How many of these partners (of Kuhn, Loeb Company) are American citizens?\" WARBURG: \"They are all American citizens except Mr. Kahn.

Paul Warburg explained this curious situation by telling the Committee that they had no influence over each other’s political beliefs, \"as finance and politics don’t mix.\" Questions about Warburg’s appointment vanished in a hue and cry with Wilson’s sole appointment to the Board of Governors, Thomas B.

Meeting with it at least four times a year will be a bankers’ advisory council representing every regional reserve district in the system. How could we have exercised greater caution in safeguarding the public interest? Carter Glass neither then nor later gave any substantiation for his belief that a group of bankers would protect the interests of the public, nor is there any evidence in the history of the United States that any group of bankers has ever done so. In fact, the Federal Advisory Council proved to be the \"administrative process\" which Paul Warburg had inserted into the Federal Reserve Act to provide just the type of remote but unseen control over the System which he desired. When he was asked by financial reporter C.W. Barron, just after the Federal Reserve Act was enacted into law by Congress, whether he approved of the bill as it was finally passed, Warburg replied, \"Well, it hasn’t got quite everything we want, but the lack can be adjusted later by administrative processes.\" The council proved to be the ideal vehicle for Warburg’s purposes, as it has functioned for seventy years in almost complete anonymity, its members and their business associations, unnoticed by the public."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 Senator Robert Owen, chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, had said, as quoted in The New York Times, August 3, 1913 before passage of the act: \"The Federal Reserve Act will furnish the bank and industrial and commercial interests with the discount of qualified commercial paper and thus stabilize our commercial and industrial life. The Federal Reserve banks are not intended as money making banks, but to serve a great national purpose of accommodating commerce and businessmen and banks, safeguard a fixed market for manufactured goods, for agricultural products and for labor. There is no reason why the banks should be in control of the Federal Reserve system. Stability will make our commerce expand healthfully in every direction.\" 40 Senator Owen’s optimism was doomed by the domination of the Jekyll Island promoters over the initial composition of the Federal Reserve System. Not only did the Morgan-Kuhn, Loeb alliance purchase the dominant control of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with almost half of the shares owned by the five New York banks under their control, First National Bank, Na tional City Bank, National Bank of Commerce, Chase National Bank and Hanover National Bank, but they also persuaded President Woodrow Wilson to appoint one of the Jekyll Island group, Paul Warburg, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

The president of a small bank in St. Louis or Cincinnati, sitting in conference with Paul Warburg and J.P. Morgan to \"advise\" them on monetary policy, would be unlikely to contradict two of the most powerful international fina nciers in the world, as a scribbled note from either one of them would be sufficient to plunge his little bank into bankruptcy. In fact, the small banks of the twelve Federal Reserve districts existed only as satellites of the big New York financial interests, and were completely at their mercy. Martin Mayer, in The Bankers, points out that \"J.P.

In 1908, to reinvest the large annual dividends from their First National Bank of New York stock, Baker and Morgan set up a holding company, First Security Corporatio n, which bought 500 shares of the First National Bank of Minneapolis.

However, he was not ready to sever his connection with the Federal Reserve System which he had done so much to set up and put into operation. J.P.

The claim that the \"advice\" of the council members is not binding on the Governors or that it carries no weight is to claim that four times a year, twelve of the most influential bankers in the United States take time from their work to travel to Washington to meet with the Federal Reserve Board merely to drink coffee and exchange pleasantries.

How could the Kuhn, Loeb- Morgan alliance, powerful though it might be, believe that it would be capable, first, of devising a plan which would bring the entire money and credit of the people of the United States into their hands, and second, of getting such a plan enacted into law? The capability of devising and enacti ng the \"National Reserve Plan\", as the immediate result of the Jekyll Island expedition was called, was easily within the powers of the Kuhn, Loeb-Morgan alliance, according to the following from McClure’s Magazine, August 1911, \"The Seven Men\" by John Moody: \"Seven men in Wall Street now control a great share of the fundamental industry and resources of the United States. Three of the seven men, J.P. Morgan, James J. Hill, and George F. Baker, head of the First National Bank of New York belong to the so-called Morgan group; four of them, John D. and William Rockefeller, James Stillman, head of the National City Bank, and Jacob H.

What John Moody did not know, or did not tell his readers, was that the most powerful men in the United States were themselves answerable to another power, a foreign power, and a power which had been steadfastly seeking to extend its control over the young republic of the United States since its very inception. This power was the financial power of England, centered in the London Branch of the House of Rothschild.

The ten largest bank holding companies in the United States are firmly in the hands of certain banking houses, all of which have branches in London. They are J.P. Morgan Company, Brown Brothers Harriman, Warburg, Kuhn Loeb and J. Henry Schroder. All of them maintain close relationships with the House of Rothschild, principally through the Rothschild control of international money markets through its manipulation of the price of gold. Each day, the world price of gold is set in the London office of N.M. Rothschild and Company."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 8 4 Although these firms are ostensibly American firms, which merely maintain branches in London, the fact is that these banking houses actually take their direction from Lo ndon. Their history is a fascinating one, and unknown to the American public, originating as it did in the international traffic in gold, slav es, diamonds, and other contraband. There are no moral considerations in any business decision made by these firms. They are interested solely in money and power. Tourists today gape at the magnificent mansions of the very rich in Newport, Rhode Island, without realizing that not only do these \"cottages\" stand as a memorial to the baronial desires of our Victorian millionaires, but that their erection in Newport represented a nostalgic memorialization of the great American fortunes, which had their beginnings in Newport when it wa s the capital of the slave trade. The slave trade for centuries had its headquarters in Venice, until Seventeenth Centur y Britain, the new master of the seas, used its control of the oceans to gain a monopoly. As the American colonies were settled, its fiercely independent people, most of whom did not want slaves, found to their surprise that slaves were being sent to our ports in great numbers. For many years, Newport was the capital of this unsavory trade. William Ellery, the Collector of the Port of Newport, said in 1791: \"...an Ethiopian cld as soon change his skin as a Newport merchant cld be induced to change so lucrative a trade.... for the slow profits of any manufactory.\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 8 5 John Quincy Adams remarked in his Diary, page 459, \"Newport’s former prosperity was chiefly owing to its extensive employment in the African slave trade.\" The pre-eminence of J.P. Morgan and the Brown firm in American finance can be dated to the development of Baltimore as the nineteenth century capital of the slave trade. Both of these firms originated in Baltimore, opened branches in London, came under the aegis of the House of Rothschild, and returned to the United States to open branches in New York and to become the dominant power, not only in finance, but also in government. In recent years, key posts such as Secretary of Defense have been held by Robert Lovett, partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, and Thomas S. Gates, partner of Drexel and Company, a J.P. Morgan sub- 48 sidiary firm. The present Vice President, George Bush, is the son of Prescott Bush, a partner of Brown Brot hers Harriman, for many years the senator from Connecticut, and the financial organizer of Columbia Broadcasting System of which he al so was a director for many years. To understand why these firms operate as they do, it is necessary to give a brief history of their origins. Few Americans know that J.P. Morgan Company began as George Peabody and Company. George Peabody (1795-1869), born at South Danvers, Massachusetts, began business in Georgetown, D. C. in 1814 as Peabody, Riggs and Company, dealing in wholesale dry goods, and in operating the Georgetown Slave Market. In 1815, to be closer to their source of supply, they moved to Baltimore, where they operated as Peabody and Riggs, from 1815 to 1835. Peabody found himself increasingly"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 8 6 involved with business originating from London, and in 1835, he established the firm of George Pe abody and Company in London. He had excellent entree in London business through another Baltimore firm established in Liverpool, the Brown Brothers. Alexander Brown came to Baltimore in 1801, and established what is now known as the oldest banking house in the United States, still operating as Brown Brothers Harriman of New York; Brown, Shipley and Company of England; and Alex Brown and Son of Baltimore. The behind the scenes power wielded by this firm is indicated by the fact that Sir Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England for many years, was a partner of Brown, Shipley and Company.* Consid ered the single most influential banker in the world, Sir Montagu Norman was organizer of \"informal talks\" between heads of central banks in 1927, which led directly to the Great Stockmarket Crash of 1929. Soon after he arrived in London, George Peabody was surprised to be summoned to an audience with the gruff Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Without mincing words, Rothschild revealed to Peabody, that much of the London aristocrac y openly disliked Rothschild and refused his invitations. He proposed that Peabody, a man of modest means, be established as a lavish host whose entertainments would soon be the talk of London. Rothsc hild would, of course, pay all the bills. Peabody accepted the offer, and soon became known as the most popular host in London. His annual Fourth of July dinner, celebrating American Independen ce, became extremely popular with the English aristocracy, many of whom, while drinking Peabody’s wine, regaled each other with jokes about Rothschild’s crudities and bad manners, without realizing that every drop they drank had been paid for by Rothschild."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 8 7 __________________________ * \"There is an informal understanding that a director of Brown, Shipley should be on the Board of the Bank of England, and Norman was elected to it in 1907.\" Montagu Norman, Current Biography, 1940. 49 It is hardly surprising that the most popular host in London would also become a very successful businessman, particularly with the House of Rothschild supporting him behind the scenes. Peabody often operated with a capital of 500,000 pounds on hand, and became very astute in his buying and selling on both sides of the Atlantic. His American agent was the Boston firm of Beebe, Morgan and Company, headed by Junius S. Morgan, father of John Pierpont Morgan. Peabody, who never married, had no one to succeed him, and he was very favorably impressed by the tall, handsome Junius Morgan. He persuaded Morgan to join him in London as a partner in George Peabody and Company in 1854. In 1860, John Pierpo nt Morgan had been taken on as an apprentice by the firm of Duncan, Sherman in New York. He was not very attentive to business, and in 1864, Morgan’s father was outraged when Duncan, Sherman refused to make his son a partner. He promptly extended an arrangement whereby one of the chief employees of Duncan, Sherman, Charles H. Dabney, was persuaded to join John Pierpont Morgan in a new firm, Dabney, Morgan and Company. Bankers Magazine, Dece mber, 1864, noted that Peabody had withdrawn his account from Duncan, Sherman, and that other firms were expected to do so. The Peabody account, of course, went to Dabney, Morgan Company."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 John Pierpont Morgan was born in 1837, during the first money panic in the United States. Significantly, it had been caused by the House of Rothschild, with whom Morgan wa s later to become associated. In 1836, President Andrew Jackson, infuriated by the tactics of the bankers who were attempting to pers uade him to renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States , said, \"You are a den of vipers. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.\" Although Nicholas Biddle was President of the Bank of the United States, it was well known that Baron James de Rothschild of Paris was the principal investor in this central bank. Although Jackson had vetoed the renewal of the charter of the Bank of the United States, he probably was unaware that a few mont hs earlier, in 1835, the House of Rothschild had cemented a relationship with the United States Government by superseding the firm of Baring as financial agent of the Department of State on January 1, 1835. Henry Clews, the famous banker, in his book, Twenty-eight Years in Wall Street33, states that the Panic of 1837 was engineered because the charter of the Second Bank of the United States had run out in 1836. Not only did President Jackson promptly withdraw government funds __________________________ 33 Henry Clews, Twenty-eight Years in Wall Street, Irving Company, New York, 1888, page 157 50"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 8 9 from the Second Bank of the United States, but he deposited these funds, $10 million, in state banks. The immediate result, Cl ews tells us, is that the country began to enjoy grea t prosperity. This sudden flow of cash caused an immediate expansion of the national economy, and the government paid off the entire national debt, leaving a surplus of $50 million in the Treasury. The European financiers had the answer to this situation. Clews further states, \"The Panic of 1837 was aggravated by the Bank of England when it in one day threw out all the paper connected with the United States.\" The Bank of England, of course, was synonymous with the name of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Why did the Bank of England in one day \"throw out\" all paper connected with the United States, that is, refuse to accept or discount any securities, bonds or other financial paper based in the United States? Th e purpose of this action was to create an immediate financial panic in the United States, cause a complete contraction of credit, halt further issues of stocks and bonds, and ruin those seeking to turn United States securities into cash. In this atmosphere of financial panic, John Pierpont Morgan came into the world. His grandmother, Joseph Morgan, was a well to do farmer who owned 106 acres in Hartford, Connect icut. He later opened the City Hotel, and the Exchange Coffee Sh op, and in 1819, was one of the founders of the Aetna Insurance Company. George Peabody found that he had chosen well in selecting Junius S. Morgan as his successor. Morgan agreed to continue the sub rosa relationship with N.M. Rothschild Company, and soon expanded the firm’s activities by shipping large quan tities of railroad iron to the United"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 9 0 States. It was Peabody iron which was the foundation for much of American railroad tracks from 1860 to 1890. In 1864, content to retire and leave his firm in the hands of Morgan, Peabody allowed the name to be changed to Junius S. Morgan Company. The Morgan firm then and since has always been direct ed from London. John Pierpont Morgan spent much of his time at his magnificent London mansion, Prince’s Gate. One of the high water marks of the successful Rothschild-Peabody Morgan business venture was the Panic of 1857. It had been twenty years since the Panic of 1837: its less ons had been forgotten by hordes of eager investors who were anxious to invest the profits of a developing America. It was time to fleece them again. The stock market operates like a wave washing up on the beach. It sweeps with it many minuscule creatures who derive all of their life support from the oxygen and water of the wave. They coast along at the crest of the \"Tide of Prosperity\". Suddenly the wave, having reached the high water mark on the beach, recedes, leavin g all of the creatures gasping on the sand. Another wave may come in time to 51 save them, but in all likelihood it will not come as far, and some of the sea creatures are doomed. In the same manner, waves of prosperity, fed by newly created money, through an artificial contraction of credit, recedes, leaving those it had borne high to gasp and die without hope of salvation. Corsair, the Life of J. P. Morgan,34 tells us that the Panic of 1857 was caused by the collapse of the grain market and by the sudden collapse of Ohio Life and Trust, for a loss of five million dollars. With this"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 9 1 collapse nine hundred other American companies failed. Significantly, one not only survived, but prospered from the crash. In Corsair, we learn that the Bank of England lent George Peabody and Company five million pounds during the panic of 1857. Winkler, in Morgan the Magnificent35 says that the Bank of England advanced Peabody one million pounds, an enormous sum at that time, and the equivalent of one hundred million dollars today, to save the firm. However, no other firm received such beneficence during this Panic. The reason is revealed by Matthew Josephson, in The Robber Barons. He says on page 60: \"For such qualities of conservati sm and purity, George Peabody and Company, the old tree out of which the House of Morgan grew, was famous. In the panic of 1857, when depreciated securities had been thrown on the market by distressed investors in America, Peabody and the elder Morgan, being in possession of cash, had purchased such bonds as possessed real value freely, and then resold them at a large advance when sanity was restored.\"36 Thus, from a number of biographies of Morgan, the story can be pieced together. After the panic had been engineered, one firm came into the market with one million pounds in cash, purchased securities from distressed investors at panic prices, and later resold them at an enormous profit. That fi rm was the Morgan firm, and behind it was the clever maneuvering of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. The association remained secret from the most knowledgeable financial minds in London and New York, although Morgan occasionally appeared as the financial agent in a Rothschild operation. As the Morgan firm grew rapidly during the late nineteenth century, until it"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 9 2 dominated the finances of the nati on, many observers were puzzled that the Rothschilds seemed so little interested in profiting by investing in the rapidly advancing American economy. John Moody notes, in The Masters of Capital, page 27, \"The Rothschilds were content to remain a close ally of Morgan... as far as the American field was concerned.’37 Secrecy was more profitable than valor. __________________________ 34 Corsair, The Life of Morgan 35 John K.

Morgan and Company is explained by George Wheeler, in Pierpont Morgan and Friends, the Anatomy of a Myth, page 17: \"But there were steps being taken even now to bring him out of the financial backwaters and they were not being taken by Pierpont Morgan himself. The first sugge stion of his name for a role in the recharging of the reserve originated with the London branch of the House of Rothschild, Belmont’s employers.\"38 Wheeler goes on to explain that a considerable anti-Rothschild movement had developed in Europe and the United States which focused on the banking activities of the Rothschild family. Even though"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 9 3 they had a registered agent in the United States, August Schoenberg, who had changed his name to Belmont when he came to the United States as the representative of the Rothschilds in 1837, it was extremely advantageous to them to have an American representative who was not known as a Rothschild agent. Although the London house of Junius S. Morgan and Company continued to be the dominant branch of the Morgan enterprises, with the death of the senior Morgan in 1890 in a carriage accident on the Riviera, John Pierpont Morgan became the head of the firm. After operating as the American representative of the London firm from 1864-1871 as Dabney Morgan Comp any, Morgan took on a new partner in 1871, Anthony Drexel of Philadelphia and operated as Drexel Morgan and Company until 1895. Drexel died in that year, and Morgan changed the name of the American branch to J.P. Morgan and Company. LaRouche39 tells us that on Februa ry 5, 1891, a secret association known as the Round Table Group was formed in London by Cecil Rhodes, his banker, Lord Rothschild, the Rothschild in-law, Lord Rosebery, and Lord Curzon. He states that in the United States the Round Table was represented by the Morgan group. Dr. Carrol Quigley refers to this group as \"The British-American Secret Society\" in Tragedy and Hope, stating that \"The chief ba ckbone of this organization grew up along the already existing fina ncial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of international financiers in London led by Lazard Brothers (in 1901).\"40"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 9 4 William Guy Carr, in Pawns In The Game states that, \"In 1899, J.P.

In 1689, the same group of bankers regained power in England by putting King William of Orange on the throne. He soon repaid his backers by ordering the British Treasury to borrow 1,250,000 pounds from these bankers.

By 1698, the British Treasury owed 16 million pounds sterling to the Bank of England. By 1815, principally du e to the compounding of interest, the debt had risen to 885 million pounds sterling.

Although they achieved political freedom, financial independence proved to be a more difficult matter. In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, at the behest of European bankers, formed the first Bank of the United States, a central bank with much the same powers as the Bank of England. Th e foreign influences behind this bank, more than a century later, were able to get the Federal Reserve Act through Congress, giving them at last the central bank of issue for our economy. Although the Federal Re serve Bank was neither Federal, being owned by private stockholders, nor a Reserve, because it was intended to create money, instead of to hold it in reserve, it did achieve enormous financial power, so much so that it has gradually superseded the popular elected government of the United States.

We have already established that the monetary policies of the United States, the interest rates, the volume and value of money, and sales of bonds, are decided, not by the figurehead of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, but by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The pretended decentralizati on of the Federal Reserve System and its twelve, equally autonomous \"regional\" banks, is and has been a deception since the Federal Reserv e Act became law in 1913. That United States monetary policy stems solely from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is yet another fallacy. That the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is itself autonomous, and free to set monetary policy for the entire United States without any outside interference is especially untrue. We might believe in this autonomy if we did not know that the majority stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was purchased by three New York City banks: First National Bank, National City Bank, and the National Bank of Commerce.

However, Minsky has become famous for his theory of the \"dominant frame\" . He states that in any particular situation, there is a \"dominant frame\" to which everything in that situation is related and through which it can be interpreted. The \"dominant frame\" in the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve System is that these decisions are made by those who stand to benefit most from them.

The control over Federal Reserve System decisions is also founded in another unique situation. Each day, representatives of four other London banking firms meet in the offices of N.M.

The other four bankers are from Samuel Montagu Company, which ranks Number 5 on the list of seventeen London merchant bank ing firms, Sharps Pixley, Johnson Matheson, and Mocatta and Goldsmid. Despite the huge tide of paper pyramided currency and notes which are now flooding the world, at some point, every credit extension must return to be based, in however minuscule a fashion, on some deposit of gold in some bank somewhere in the world. Because of this factor, the London merchant bankers, with their power to set th e price of gold each day, become the final arbiters of the volume of money and the price of money in those countries which must bow to their power. Not the least of these is the United States. No official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, can command the power over the money of the world which is held by these London merchant bankers. Great Britain, wh ile waning in political and military power, today exercises the greatest financial power.

Hamill (on page 156) identifies Fr ancqui as the director of many atrocities committed against natives in the Congo. \"For every cartridge they spent, they had to bring in a man’s hand\". Francqui’s frightful record may have been the source for the charge later leveled against German soldiers in Belgium, that they chopped off the hands of women and children, a claim which proved to be groundless. Hamill also says that Francqui \"tricked the Americans out of the Hankow- Canton railroad concession in China in 1901, and at the same time had ‘stood by’ in case Hoover needed any further help in the ‘taking’ of the Kaiping coal mines. This is the humanitarian who had sole charge of the distribution of the Be lgian ‘relief’ during the World War, for which Hoover did the buying and shipping. Francqui was a director with Hoover, in the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company (the Kaiping mines), throug h which Hoover transp orted 200,000 Chinese slave workers to the Congo to work Francqui’s copper mines.\" Hamill says on page 311 that \"Francqui opened the offices of the Belgian Relief in his bank, Societe Generale, as a one-man show, with a letter of permission from the German Governor General von der Goltz dated October 16, 1914. The New York Herald Tribune of February 18, 1930, quoted by Congressman Louis McFadden in the House on February 26, 1930, said, \"One of Belgium’s two directors on the Bank for International Settlements will be Emile Francqui of the Societe Generale, a member"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 of both the Young and Dawes Plan Committees. The board of directors of the international bank will have no more colorful character than Emile Francqui, former Minister of Finance, veteran of the Congo and China . . . he is rated as the richest man in Belgium, and among the twelve richest men in Europe.\" Despite his prominence, The New York Times Index mentions Francqui only a few times during two decades before his death. On October 3, 1931, The New York Times quoted Le Pe uple of Brussels that Francqui would visit the United States. \"As a friend of President Hoover, Monsieur Francqui will not fail to pa y a visit to the President.\" 70 On October 30, 1931, The New York Times reported this visit with the headline, \"Hoover-Francqui Talk was Unofficial\". \"It was stated that Mr. Francqui spent Tuesday night as a pe rsonal guest of the President, and that they talked of world financial problems in general, strictly unofficial. Mr. Francqui was an associate of President Hoover during the latters ministrations in Belgium during the war. Their visit had no official significance. Mr. Francqui is a private citizen and not engaged in any official mission.\" No reference is made to the Hoover-Francqui business associations which were the subject of huge lawsuits in London. The Francqui visit probably involved Hoover’s Moratorium on German War Debts, which stunned the financial world. On December 15, 1931, Chairman McFadden informed the House of a di spatch in the Public Ledger of Philadelphia, October 24, 1931, \"G ERMAN REVEALS HOOVER’S SECRET. The American President was in intimate negotiations with the German government regarding a year’s debt holiday as early as December,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 1930.\" McFadden continued, \"Behind the Hoover announcement there were many months of hurried and furtive preparations both in Germany and in Wall Street offices of German banker s. Germany, like a sponge, had to be saturated with American money. Mr. Hoover himself had to be elected, becaus e this scheme began before he became President. If the German international bankers of Wall Street-- that is Kuhn Loeb Company, J. & W. Seligman, Paul Warburg, J. Henry Schroder--and their satellites had not had this job waiting to be done, Herbert Hoover would never have been elected President of the United States. The election of Mr. Hoover to the Presidency was through the influence of the Warburg Brothers, directors of the great bank of Kuhn Loeb Company, who carr ied the cost of his election. In exchange for this collaboration Mr . Hoover promised to impose the moratorium of German debts. Hoover sought to exempt Kreuger’s loan to Germany of $125 million from the operation of the Hoover Moratorium. The nature of Kreuger’s swindle was known here in January when he visited his friend, Mr. Hoover, in the White House.\" Not only did Hoover entertain Francqui in the White House, but also Ivar Kreuger, the most famous sw indler of the twentieth century. When Francqui died on Novemb er 13, 1935, The New York Times memorialized him as \"the copper king of the Congo . . . Mr. Francqui, last year having gained dictatorial powers over the belga, maintained it on the gold standard during a cris is. In 1891 he led an expedition into the Congo and gained it for King Leopold. A man of great wealth, rated among the twelve richest men in Europe, he secured enormous copper deposits. He was Minister of State in 1926 and Minister of Finance in 1934. It was his pride that he never accepted a centime of"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 12 6 remuneration for his services to the government. While consul general at Shanghai, he secured valuable concessions, notably the Kaiping coal mines and the 71 railway concession for the Tientsin Railroad. He was governor of the Societe Generale de Belgique, Lloyd Royal Belge, and regent of La Banque Nationale de Belgique.\" The Times does not mention Francqui’s business partnerships with Hoover. Like Francqui, Hoover also refused remuneration for \"government service\", and as Secretary of Commerce and as President of the United States, he turned his salary back to the government. On December 13, 1932, Chairman Mc Fadden introduced a resolution of impeachment against President Hoover for high crimes and misdemeanors, which covers many pages, including violation of contracts, unlawful dissipation of the financial resources of the United States, and his appointment of Eugene Meyer to the Federal Reserve Board. The resolution was tabled and never acted upon by the House. In criticizing Hoover’s Moratorium of German War Debts, McFadden had referred to Hoover’s \"German\" backers. Although all of the principals of \"the London Connection\" did originate in Germany, most of them in Frankfurt, at the time they sponsored Hoover’s candidacy for the Presidency of the United States, they were operating from London, as Hoover himself had done for most of his career. Also, the Hoover Moratorium was not intended to \"help\" Germany, as Hoover had never been \"pro-Germa n\". The Moratorium on Germany’s war debts was necessary so that Germany would have funds for"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 rearming. In 1931, the trul y forward-looking diplomats were anticipating the Second World War, and there could be no war without an \"aggressor\". Hoover had also carried out a number of mining promotions in various parts of the world as a secret agent for the Rothschilds, and had been rewarded with a directorship in one of the principal Rothschild enterprises, the Rio Tinto Mines in Spain and Bolivia. Francqui and Hoover threw themselves into the seemingly impossible task of provisioning Germany during the First World War. Their success was noted in Nordeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, March 13, 1915, which noted that large quantities of food were now arriving from Belgium by rail. Schmoller’s Yearbook for Legisl ation, Administration and Political Economy for 1916, shows that one bi llion pounds of meat, one and a half billion pounds of potatoes, one and a half billion pounds of bread, and one hundred twenty-one mill ions pounds of butter had been shipped from Belgium to Germany in that year. A patriotic British woman who had operated a small hospital in Belgium for several years, Edith Cavell, wrote to the Nurs ing Mirror in London, April 15, 1915, complaining that the \"Belgian Relief\" supplies were being shipped to Germany to feed the German army. The Germans considered Miss Cavell to be of no importance, and paid no attention to her, but the British Intelligence Service in London was appalled by Miss Cavell’s discovery, and demanded that the Germans arrest her as a spy. 72 Sir William Wiseman, head of British Intelligence, and partner of Kuhn Loeb Company, feared that the cont inuance of the war was at stake, and secretly notified the Germans that Miss Cavell must be executed."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 12 8 The Germans reluctantly arrested her and charged her with aiding prisoners of war to escape. The usual penalty for this offense was three months imprisonment, but the Germans bowed to Sir William Wiseman’s demands, and shot Edith Cavell, thus creating one of the principal martyrs of the First World War. With Edith Cavell out of the way, the \"Belgian Relief\" operation continued, although in 1916, German emissaries again approached London officials with the information that they did not believe Germany could continue military operations, not only because of food shortages, but because of financial problems. More \"emergency relief\" was sent, and Germany continued in the war until November, 1918. Two of Hoover’s principal assistants were a former lumber shipping clerk from the West Coast, Prentiss Gray, and Julius H. Barnes, a grain salesman from Duluth. Both men became partners in J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation in New York after the war, and amassed large fortunes, principally in grain and sugar. With the entry of the United States into the war, Barnes and Gray were given important posts in the newly created U.S. Food Administration, which also was placed under Herbert Hoover’s direction. Barnes became President of the Grain Corporation of the U.S. Food Administration from 1917 to 1918, and Gray was chief of Marine Transportation. Another J. Henry Schroder partner, G. A. Zabriskie, was named head of the U.S. Sugar Equalization Board. Thus the London Connection controlled all food in th e United States through its grain and sugar \"Czars\" during the First World War. Despite many complaints of corruption and scandal in the U.S. Food Administration, no one was ever indicted. After the war, the partners of J.

His father, Baron Rudolph von Schroder of Hamburg, was a director of Sao Paulo Coffee Ltd., one of the largest Brazilian coffee companies, with F.C. Tiarks, also of the Schroder firm.* __________________________ * The New York Times noted on October 11, 1923: \"Frank C.

As his principal assistant in the U.S. Food Administration, Hoover chose Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss, who was soon to become a partner in Kuhn Loeb Company, marrying the daughter of Jerome Hanauer of Kuhn Loeb. Throughout his distinguishe d humanitarian service with the Belgian Relief Commission, the U.S. Food Administration, and, after the war, the American Relief Administ ration, Hoover’s closest associate was one Edgar Rickard, born in Pontgibaud, France. In Who’s Who, he"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 states that he was \"World War ad ministrative assistant to Herbert Hoover in all war and post-war or ganizations including the Commission For Relief in Belgium. He also served on the U.S. Food Administration from 1914-1924.\" He remained one of Hoover’s closest friends, and usually the Rickards and Hoovers took their vacations together. After Hoover became Secretary of Comm erce under Coolid ge, Hamill tells us that Hoover awarded his friend the Hazeltine Radio patents, which paid him one million dollars a year in royalties. In 1928, \"the London Connection\" decided to run Herbert Hoover for president of the United States. There was only one problem; although Herbert Hoover had been born in the United States, and was thus eligible for the office of the presid ency, according to the Constitution, he had never had a business address or a home address in the United States, as he had gone abroad just after completing college at Stanford. The result was that during his campaign for the presidency, Herbert Hoover listed as his Amer ican address Suite 2000, 42 Broadway, New York, which was the office of Edgar Rickard. Suite 2000 was also shared by the grain tycoon and partner of J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation, Julius H. Barnes. After Herbert Hoover was elected pr esident of the United States, he insisted on appointing one of the old London crowd, Eugene Meyer, as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Meyer’s father had been one of the partners of Lazard Freres of Paris, and Lazard Brothers of London. Meyer, with Baruch, had been one of the most powerful men in the United States during World War I, a member of the famous Triumvirate which exercised unequalled power; Meyer as Chairman of the War Finance Corporation, Bernard Baruch as Chairman of the War"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 Industries Board, and Paul Warburg as Governor of the Federal Reserve System. A longtime critic of Eugene Meyer, Chairman Louis McFadden of the House Banking and Currency Committee, was quoted in The New York Times, December 17, 1930, as having made a speech on the floor of the House attacking Hoover’s appointment of Meyer, and charging that \"He 74 represents the Rothschild interest and is liaison officer between the French Government and J.P. Morgan.\" On December 18, The Times reported that \"Herbert Hoover is deeply concerned\" and that McFadden’s speech was \"an unfortun ate occurrence.\" On December 20, The Times commented on the editorial page, under the headline, \"McFadden Again\", \"The speech ought to insure the Senate ratification of Mr. Meyer as head of the Federal Reserve. The speech was incoherent, as Mr. McFadden’s speeches usually are.\" As The Times predicted, Meyer was duly approved by the Senate. Not content with having a friend in the White House, J. Henry Schroder Corporation was soon embarked on further international adventures, nothing less than a plan to set up World War II. This was to be done by providing, at a crucial juncture, the financing for Adolf Hitler’s assumption of power in Germany. Although any number of magnates have been given credit for the financing of Hitler, including Fritz Thyssen, Henry Ford, and J.P. Morg an, they, as well as others, did provide millions of doll ars for his political campaigns during the 1920s, just as they did for others who also had a chance of winning, but who disappeared and were never heard fr om again. In December of 1932,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 it seemed inevitable to many observers of the German scene that Hitler was also ready for a toboggan slide into oblivion. Despite the fact that he had done well in national campaigns, he had spent all the money from his usual sources and now faced heavy debts. In his book Aggression, Otto Lehmann-Russbeldt tell s us that \"Hitler was invited to a meeting at the Schroder Bank in Berlin on January 4, 1933. The leading industrialists and bankers of Germany tided Hitler over his financial difficulties and enabled him to meet the enormous debt he had incurred in connection with the main tenance of his private army. In return, he promised to break the po wer of the trade unions.

They had represented the United States at the Paris Peace Co nference (1919); John Foster Dulles would die in harness as Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, while Allen Dulles headed the Central Intelligence Agency for many years. Their apologists have seldom attempted to defend the Dulles brothers appearance at the meeting which installed Hitler as the Chancellor of Germany, preferring to pretend that it never happened.

Henry Schroder Company. Neither he nor J. Henry Schroder were to be suspected of being pro- Nazi or pro-Hitler; the inescapable fact was that if Hitler did not become Chancellor of Germany, there was little likelihood of getting a Second World War going, the war wh ich would double their profits.* The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia stat es \"The banking house Schroder Bros.

Stein & Co., which had been founded in 1788. After the Nazis gained power in 1933, Schroeder was appointed the German representative at the Bank of International Settlements. The Kilgore Committee in 1940 stated that Schroeder’s influence with the Hitler Administration was so great that he had Pierre Laval appointed head of the French Government during the Nazi Occupation. The Kilgore Committee listed more than a dozen important titles held by Kurt von Schroeder in the 1940’s, including President of Deutsche Reichsbahn, Reich Board of Economic Affairs, SS Senior Group Leader, Council of Reich Post Office, Deutsche Reichsbank and other leading banks and industrial groups. Schroeder served on the board of all International Telephone and Tele graph subsidiaries in Germany. In 1938, the London Schroder Bank became the German financial agent in Great Britain.

It was de Ropp’s advice which Hitler followed when he refused to invade England. Victor Perlo writes, in The Empire of High Finance: \"The Hitler government made the London Schroder Bank their financial agent in Britain and America. Hitler’s personal banking account was with J.M.

J. Henry Schroder WAS the Anglo-German Fellowship, the En glish equivalent of the America First movement, and also attracting patriots who did not wish to see their nation involved in a needless war with Germany.

The two divergent political groups in the 1930’s in England were the War Party, led by Winston Churchill, who furiously demanded that England go to war against Germany, and the Appe asement Party, led by Neville Chamberlain. After Munich, Hitler be lieved the Chamberlain group to be the dominant party in England, and Churchill a minor rabble-rouser. Because of his own financial backers, the Schroders, were sponsoring the Appeasement Party, Hitler believed there would be no war. He did not suspect that the backers of the Appeasement Party, now that Chamberlain had served his purpos e in duping Hitler, would cast Chamberlain aside and make Churchill the Prime Minister. It was not only Chamberlain, but also Hitler, who came away from Munich believing that it would be \"Peace in our time.\" The success of the Schroders in duping Hitler into this belief explains several of the most puzzling questions of World War II. Why did Hitler allow the British Army to decamp fr om Dunkirk and return home, when he could have wiped them out? Against the frantic advice of his generals, who wished to deliver th e coup de grace to the English Army, Hitler held back because he did not wish to alienate his supposed vast following in England. For the same reason, he refused to invade England during a period when he had military superiority, believing that it would not be necessary, as the Anglo-German Fellowship group was ready to make peace with him.

Although he appears for the first time in Who’s Who in America for 1952, Mr. Simpson states that he served under Herbert Hoover on the Commission for Relief in Belgium from 1915 to 1917; U.S. Food Administration, 1917 to 1918, American Relief Commission, 1919, and with P.N.

Like other Hoover humanitarians, Simpson also joined the J. Henry Schroder Bankin g Company (Adolf Hitler’s personal bankers) and the J. Henry Schroder Trust Company. He also became a partner of Schroder-Rockefeller Co mpany when that investment trust backed a construction company wh ich became the world’s largest, the firm of Bechtel Incorporated.

A strange sequence of events, none of which were accidental, had occurred. Without Theodore Roosevelt’s \"Bull Moose\" candidacy, the popula r President Taft would have been reelected, and Woodrow Wilson would have returned to obscurity.* If Wilson had not been elected, we might have had no Federal Reserve Act, and World War One could have been avoided. The European nations had been led to maintain la rge standing armies as the policy of the central banks which dictated their governmental decisions. In April, 1887, the Quarterly Journa l of Economics had pointed out: \"A detailed revue of the public debts of Europe shows interest and sinking fund payments of $5,343 million annually (five and one-third billion). M. Neymarck’s conclusion is much like Mr. Atkinson’s.

The American people were driven to make war on the German people, with whom we had no conceivable political or economic quarrel. Moreover, the United States comprised the largest nation in the world composed of Germans; almost half of its citizens were of German descent, and by a narrow margin, German had been voted down as the national language.* The German Ambassador to Turkey, baron Wangeheim asked the American Ambassador to Turkey, Henry Morgenthau, why the United States intended to make war in Germany. \"We Americans,\" replied"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 Morgenthau, speaking for the group of Harlem real estate operators of which he was the head, \"are going to war for a moral principle.\" J.P. Morgan received the proceeds of th e First Liberty Loan to pay off $400,000,000 which he advanced to Great Britain at the outset of the war. To cover this loan, $68,000,000 in notes had been issued under the provisions of the Aldrich-Vreeland Act for issuing notes against securities, the only time this provision was employed. The notes were retired as soon as the Federal Reserve Banks began operation, and replaced by Federal Reserve Notes. During 1915 and 1916, Wilson kept faith with the bankers who had purchased the White House for him, by continuing to make loans to the Allies. His Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, protested constantly, stating that \"Money is th e worst of all contraband.\" By 1917, the Morgans and Kuhn, Loeb Company had floated a billion and a half dollars in loans to the Allies. The bankers also financed a host of \"peace\" organizations which worked to get us involved in the World War. The Commission for Relief in Belgium manufactured atrocity stories against the Germans, while a Carneg ie organization, The League to Enforce Peace, agitated in Washington for our entry into war. This later became the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which during the 1940s was headed by Alger Hiss.

According to Under Secretary of th e Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, America’s heavy industry had been preparing for war for a year. Both the Army and Navy Departments had been purchasing war supplies in large amounts since early in 1916.

Certainly not for the American people, who had no need for \"mobilization of credit\" for a European war, or to enact an income tax to finance a war. Hull’s statement affords a rare glimpse into the machinations of our \"public servants\". The Notes of the Journal of Politic al Economy, October, 1917, state: \"The effect of the war upon the bu siness of the Federal Reserve Banks has required an immensedevelopment of the staffs of these banks, with a corresponding increase in expenses. Without, of course, being able to anticipate so early and exte nsive a demand for their services in this connection, the framers of th e Federal Reserve Act had provided that the Federal Reserve Banks should act as fiscal agents of the Government.\" The bankers had been wa iting since 1887 for the United States to enact a central bank plan so that they could finance a European war among the nations whom they had already bankrupted with armament and \"defense\" programs. The most demanding function of the central bank mechanism is war finance. On October 13, 1917, Woodrow Wilson made a major address, stating: \"It is manifestly imperative that there should be a complete mobilization of the banking reserves of the United States.

They aided greatly in the conservation of our gold resources, in the regulation of our foreign exchanges, and in the centralization of our financial energies. One shudders when he thinks what mi ght have happened if the war had found us with our former decentralized and antiquated banking system.\" Mr. Kemmerer’s shudders ignore the fact that if we had kept \"our antiquated banking system\" we would not have been able to finance the World War or to enter as a participant ourselves. Woodrow Wilson himself did not believe in his crusade to save the world for democracy. He later wrote that \"The World War was a matter of economic rivalry.\" On being questioned by Senator McCumber about the circumstances of our entry into the war, Wilson was asked, \"Do you think if Germany had committed no act of war or no act of injustice against our citizens that we would have gotten into this war?\" \"I do think so,\" Wilson replied."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 14 9 \"You think we would have gotten in anyway?\" pursued McCumber. \"I do,\" said Wilson.

Baruch was appointed head of the War Industries Board, with life and death powers over every factory in the United States. Eugene Meyer was appointed head of the War Finance Corporation, in charge of the loan program which financed the war. Paul Warburg was in control of the nation’s banking system*. Knowing that the overwhelming sentiment of the American people during 1915 and 1916 had been anti-Bri tish and pro-German, our British allies viewed with some trepidation the prominence of Paul Warburg and Kuhn, Loeb Company in the prosecution of the war. They were uneasy about his high position in the Administration because his brother, Max Warburg, was at that ti me serving as head of the German Secret Service. On December 12, 1918, the United States Naval Secret Service Report on Mr. Warburg was as follows: \"WARBURG, PAUL: New York City.

Paul Warburg’s brother Felix in New York was a director of the Prussian Life Insurance Company of Berlin, and presumably would not have liked to see too many of his policyholders killed in the war. On September 26, 1920, The New York Times mentioned in its obituary of Jacob Schiff in reference to Kuhn, Loeb and Company, \"During the world War certain of its members were in constant contact with the Government in an advisory capacity.

This explains why he was regarded with such contempt by those who learned the facts of his career. H.L.

Kuhn, Loeb Company, the nation’s largest owners of railroad properties in this coun try and in Mexico, protected their interests during the First World War by having Woodrow Wilson set up a United States Railroad Administration. The Director-General was William McAdoo, Comptroller of the Currency. Warburg replaced this set up in 1918 with a tighter organization which he called the Federal Transportation Council. The purpose of both of these organizations was to prevent strikes against Kuhn, Loeb Company during the War, in case the railroad workers should try to get in wages some of the millions of dollars in wartime profits which Kuhn, Loeb received from the United States Government. Among the important bankers present in Washington during the War was Herbert Lehman, of the rapidly rising firm of Lehman Brothers, Bankers, New York, Lehman was prompt ly put on the General Staff of the Army, and given the rank of Colonel.

The char ge on which Debs was convicted was \"spoken and written denunciation of war\". This was treason to the Wilson dictatorship, and Debs was imprisoned. As head of the Socialist Party, Debs ran for the Presidency from Atlanta Prison, the only man ever to do so, and polled more than a million votes. It was ironic that Debs’ leadership of the Socialist Party, which at that time represented the desires of many Americans for an honest government, should fall into the sickly hands of Norman Thomas, a former student and admirer of Woodrow Wilson at Princeton University.

Wilson’s appointments to the Federal Reserve Board, and that body’s responsibility for financin g the First World War, as well as Wilson’s handing over the United States to the immigrant triumvirate during the War, made him appear to be the most important single effector of ruin in American history. It is no wonder that after his abortive trip to Europe, where he was hissed and jeered in the streets by the French people, and snickered at in the halls of Versailles by Orlando and Clemenceau, Woodrow Wilson returned home to take to his bed. The sight of the destruction and death in Europe, for which he was directly responsible, was perhaps more of a shock than he could bear. The Italian Minister Pentaleoni expressed the feelings of the European peoples when he wrote that: \"Woodrow Wilson is a type of Pecksniff who was now disappeared amid universal execration.\" It is America’s misfortune that our subsidized press and educational system have been devoted to enshrining a man who colluded in causing so much death and sorrow throughout the world.

This banking house had large interests in Cuba and South America, and played a prominent part in financing the many revolutions in those countries. Its most notorious publicity came during the Senate Finance Committee’s investigation in 1933, when it was brought out that J & W Seligman had given a $415,000 bribe to Juan Leguia, son of the President of Peru, in order to get that nation to accept a loan. A partial list of Albert Strauss’ directorships, according to \"Who’s Who\", shows that he was: Chairman of the Board of the Cuba Cane Sugar Corporation; director, Brooklyn Ma nhattan Transit Co., Coney Island Brooklyn RR, New York Rapid Transit, Pierce-Arrow, Cuba Tobacco Corporation, and the Eastern Cuba Sugar Corporation. Governor Delano resigned in August, 1918, to be commissioned a Colonel in the Army. The war ended on November 11, 1918. William McAdoo was replaced in 1918 by Carter Glass as Secretary of the Treasury. Both Strauss and Glass were present during the secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board on May 18, 1920, when the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21 was made possible. One of the main lies about the Federal Reserve Act when it was being ballyhooed in 1913 was its promise to take care of the farmer. Actually,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 it has never taken care of anybody but a few big bankers. Prof. O.M.W. Sprague, Harvard economist, writing in the Quarterly Journal of Economics of February, 1914, said: \"The primary purpose of the Federal Reserve Act is to make sure that there will always be an available supply of money and credit in this country to meet unusual banking requirements.\" There is nothing in that wording to help the farmer. The First World War had introduced into this country a general prosperity, as revealed by the stocks of heavy industry on the New York Exchange in 1917-1918, by the increase in the amount of money circulated, and by the enormous bank clearings during the whole of 1918. It was the assigned duty of the Federal Reserv e System to get back the vast amount 114 of money and credit which had escape d their control during this time of prosperity. This was done by the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21. The operations of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee in 1917-18, while Paul Warburg was still Chairman, show a tremendous increase in purchases of bankers’ and trade acceptances. There was also a great increase in the purcha se of United States Government securities, under the leadership of the able Eugene Meyer, Jr. A large part of the stock market speculat ion in 1919, at the end of the War when the market was very unsettled, was financed with funds borrowed from Federal Reserve Banks with Government securities as collateral. Thus the Federal Reserve System set up the Depression, first"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 by causing inflation, and then rais ing the discount rate and making money dear. In 1914, Federal Reserve Bank rates had dropped from six percent to four percent, had gone to a furthe r low of three percent in 1916, and had stayed at that level until 1920. The reason for the low interest rate was the necessity for floating the bi llion dollar Liberty Loans. At the beginning of each Liberty Loan Drive, the Federal Reserve Board put a hundred million dollars into the Ne w York money market through its open market operations, in order to provide a cash impetus for the drive. The most important role of the Liberty Bonds was to soak up the increase in circulation of the medium of exchange (integer of account) brought about by the large amount of currency and credit put out during the war. Laborers were paid high wages, and farmers received the highest prices for their produce they had ever known. These two groups accumulated millions of dollars in cash which they did not put into Liberty Bonds. That money was effectively out of the hands of the Wall Street group whic h controlled the money and credit of the United States. They wanted it back, and that is why we had the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21. Much of the money was deposited in small country banks in the Middle West and West which had refused to have any part of the Federal Reserve System, the farmers and ranc hers of those regions seeing no good reason why they should give a group of international financiers control of their money. The main job of the Federal Reserve System was to break these small country banks and get back the money which had been paid out to the farmers during the war, in effect, ruin them, and this it proceeded to do."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 First of all, a Federal Farm Loan Board was set up which encouraged the farmers to invest their accrued money in land on long term loans, which the farmers were eager to do. Then inflation was allowed to take its course in th is country and in Europe in 1919 and 1920. The purpose of the inflation in Europe was to cancel out a large portion of the war debts owed by the Allies to the American people, and its purpose in this country was to draw in the excess moneys which had been distributed to 115 the working people in the form of higher wages and bonuses for production. As prices went higher and higher, the money which the workers had accumulated became worth less and less, inflicting upon them an unfair drain, while the propertied classes were enriched by the inflation because of the enormous increase in the value of land and manufactured goods. The workers were thus effectively impoverished, but the farmers, who were as a class more thrifty, and who were more self-sufficient, had to be handled more harshly. G.W. Norris, in \"Collier’s Ma gazine\" of March 20, 1920, said: \"Rumor has it that two members of the Federal Reserve Board had a plain talk with some New York bankers and financiers in December, 1919. Immediately afterwards, there was a notable decline in transactions on the stock market and a cessatio n of company promotions. It is understood that action in the same general direction has already been taken in other sections of the country, as evidence of the abuse of the Federal Reserve System to promote speculation in land and commodities appeared.\""},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 Senator Robert L.

What took place in 1920 was just the reverse of what should have been taking place. Instead of liquidating the excess of credits created by the war through a period of years, the Federal Reserve Board met in a meeting which was not disclosed to the public. They met on the 18th of May, 1920, and it was a secret meeting. They spent all day conferring; the minutes made sixty printed pages, and they appear in Senate Document 310 of February 19, 1923.

The Class C Directors, representing the people of the United States, were not present and were not invited to be present.

Certainly mechanics and farm laborers could have caused no more damage to the country than did Glass, Strauss, and Warburg at the secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board. Senator Brookhart of Iowa testified that at that secret meeting Paul Warburg, also President of the Federal Advisory Council, had a resolution passed to send a committee of five to the Interstate Commerce Commission and ask for an increase in railroad rates. As head of Kuhn, Loeb Co. which owned most of the railway mileage in the United States, he was already missing the huge profits which the United States Government had paid during the war, and he wanted to inflict new price raises on the American people.

The purpose of the Board’s action was to break those state and joint land stock banks which had steadfastly refused to surrender their freedom to the banker’s dictatorship set up by the System. Kemmerer in the ABC of the Federal Reserve System had written in 1919 that: \"The tendency will be toward unific ation and simplicity which will be brought about by the state institutions, in increasing numbers, becoming stockholders and depositors in the reserve banks.\" However, the state banks had not responded. The Senate Hearings of 1923 investigating the causes of the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21 had been de manded by the American people.

The final statement on the Federal Reserve Board’s causing the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21 was made by William Jennings Bryan. In \"Hearst’s Magazine\" of November, 1923, he wrote: \"The Federal Reserve Bank that should have been the farmer’s greatest protection has become his greatest foe.

The unidentified writer, perhaps Paul Warburg, stated, \"The Federal Reserve is a fount of credit, not of capital.\" This is one of the most revealing statements ever made about the Federal Reserve System. It says that the Federal Reserve System will never add anything to our capital structure, or to the formation of capital, because it is organized to produce credit, to create money for credit money and speculations, instead of providing capital funds for the improvement of commerce and industry. Simply stated, capitalization would mean th e providing of notes backed by a precious metal or other commodity. Reserve notes are unbacked paper loaned at interest. On July 25, 1921, Senator Owen stated on the editorial page of The New York Times, The Federal Reserve Board is the most gigantic financial power in all the world. Instead of using this great power as the Federal Reserve Act intended that it should, the board....delegated this power to the banks, threw the weight of its influence toward the support of the policy of German inflation.\" The senator whose name was on the Act saw that it was not performing as promised. After the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors settled down to eight years of providing rapid credit expansion of the New York bankers, a policy which culminated in the Great Depression of 1929-31 and helped paralyze the economic"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 18 9 structure of the world.

Warburg returned to his five hundred thousand dollar a ye ar job with Kuhn, Loeb Company, but he continued to determine the policy of the Federal Reserve System, as President of the Federal Advisory Council and as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Acceptance Council. From 1921 to 1929, Paul Warburg organi zed three of the greatest trusts in the United States, the International Acceptance Bank, largest acceptance bank in the world, Agfa Ansco Film Corporation, with headquarters in Belgium, and I.G. Farben Corporation whose American 119 branch Warburg set up as I.G. Chemical Corporation. The Westinghouse Corporation is also one of his creations. In the early 1920s, the Federal Reserve System played the decisive role in the re-entry of Russia into the international finance structure. Winthrop and Stimson continued to be the correspondents between Russian and American bankers, and Henry L. Stimson handled the negotiations concluding in our recognition of the Soviet after Roosevelt’s election in 1932. This wa s an anti-climax, because we had long before resumed exchange re lations with Russian financiers.

An article in the English monthly \"Fortnightly\", July, 1922, says: \"During the past year, practically every single capitalistic institution has been restored. This is true of the State Bank, private banking, the Stock Exchange, the right to possess money to unlimited amount, the right of inheritance, the bill of exchange system, and other institutions and practices involved in the conduct of private industry and trade. A great part of the former nationalized industries are now found in semi- independent trusts.\" The organization of powerful trusts in Russia under the guise of Communism made possible the receipt of large amounts of financial and technical help from the United States. The Russian aristocracy had been wiped out because it was too inefficient to manage a modern industrial state. The international financiers provided funds for Lenin and Trotsky to overthrow the Czarist regime and keep Russia in the First World War. Peter Drucker, spokesman for the oligarchy in America, declared in an article in the Sa turday Evening Post in 1948, that: \"RUSSIA IS THE IDEAL OF THE MANAGED ECONOMY TOWARDS WHICH WE ARE MOVING.\" In Russia, the issuance of sufficient currency to handle the needs of their economy occurred only after a government had been put in power which had absolute control of the people.

Taken alone, the system is self- contained, logically perfected, even intelligent. And it can perish only through the collapse or destruction of the political edifice which it decorates.\" 120 \"Fortnightly\" also remarked, in 1929, that: \"Since 1921, the daily life of the Soviet citizen is no different from that of the American citizen, and the Soviet system of government is more economical.\" Admiral Kolchak, leader of the White Russian armies, was supported by the international bankers, who sent British and American troops to Siberia in order to have a pretext for printing Kolchak rubles. At one time in 1920, the bankers were manipulating on the London Exchange the old Czarist rubles, Kerensky rubles and Kolchak rubles, the values of all three fluctuating according to the movements of the Allied troops aiding Kolchak. Kolchak also was in possession of considerable amounts of gold which had been seiz ed by his armies. After his defeat, a trainload of this gold disappeared in Siberia. At the Senate Hearings in 1921 on the Federal Reserve Syst em, it was brought out that the System had been receiving th is gold. Congressman Dunbar questioned Governor W.P.G.

The Secretary of the Treasury has issued instructions to the assay office not to take any gold which does not be ar the mint mark of a friendly nation.\" Just what Governor Harding meant by \"a friendly nation\" is not clear. In 1921, we were not at war with any country, but Congress was already beginning to question the international gold dealings of the Federal Reserve System. Governor Harding could very well shrug his shoulders and say that it was none of the Federal Reserve Banks’ business where the gold came from. Gold knows no nationality or race. The United States by law had ceased to be interested in where its gold came from in 1906, when Secretary of the Treas ury Shaw made a rrangements with several of the larger New York banks (ones in which he had interests) to purchase gold with advances of cash from the United States Treasury, which would then purchase the gold from these banks. The Treasury could claim that it did not know wh ere its gold came from since their office only registers the bank from which it made the purchase. Since 1906, the Treasury has not known from which of the international gold merchants it was buying its gold."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 The international gold dealings of the Federal Reserve System, and its active support in helping the League of Nations to force all the nations 121 of Europe and South America back on the gold standard for the benefit of international gold merc hants like Eugene Meyer, Jr. and Albert Strauss, is best demonstrated by a classic incident, the sterling credit of 1925. J.E. Darling wrote, in the English periodical, \"Spectator\", on January 10, 1925 that: \"Obviously, it is of the first importance to the United States to induce England to resume the gold standard as early as possible. An American controlled Gold Standard, which must inevitably result in the United States becoming the world’s supreme financial power, makes England a tributary and satellite, an d New York the world’s financial centre.\" Mr. Darling fails to point out that th e American people have as little to do with this as the British people, and that resumption of the gold standard by Britain would benefit only that small group of international gold merchants who own the world’s gold. No wonder that \"Banker’s Magazine\" gleefully remark ed in July, 1925 that: \"The outstanding event of the past half year in the banking world was the restoration of the gold standard.\" The First World War changed the status of the United States from that of a debtor nation to the position of the world’s greatest creditor nation, a title formerly occupied by England.

The war also caused the removal of the headquarters of the world’s acceptance market from London to New York, and Paul Warburg became the most powerful trade acceptance banker in th e world. The mainstay of the international financiers, however, remained the same. The gold standard was still the basis of foreign exchange, and the small group of internationals who owned the gold co ntrolled the monetary system of the Western nations. Professor Gustav Ca ssel wrote in 1928: \"The American dollar, not the gold standard, is the world’s monetary standard. The AmericanFederal Re serve Board has the power to determine the purchasing power of the dollar by making changes in the rate of discount, and thus controls the monetary standard of the world.\" If this were true, the members of the Federal Reserve Board would be the most powerful financiers in the world. Occasionally their membership includes such influential men as Paul Warburg or Eugene Meyer, Jr., but usually they are a rubber-stamp committee for the Federal Advisory Council and the London bankers. In May, 1925, the British Parliament passed the Gold Standard Act, putting Great Britain back on the gold standard. The Federal Reserve System’s major role in this event came out on March 16, 1926, when George Seay, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, testified before the House Banking and Currency Committee that: 122"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 \"A verbal understanding confirme d by correspondence, extended Great Britain a two hund red million dollar gold loan or credit. All negotiations were conducte d between Benjamin Strong, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Mr. Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England. The purpose of this loan was to help England get back on the gold stan dard, and the loan was to be met by investment of Federal Reserve funds in bills of exchange and foreign securities.\" The Federal Reserve Bulletin of June, 1925, stated that: \"Under its arrangement with the Bank of England the Federal Reserve Bank of New York undertakes to sell gold on credit to the Bank of England from time to time during the next two years, but not to exceed $200,000,000 outstan ding at any one time.\" A two hundred million dollar gold credit had been arranged by a verbal understanding between the international bankers, Benjamin Strong and Montagu Norman. It was apparent by this time that the Federal Reserve System had other interests at heart than the financial needs of American business and industry. Great Britain’s return to the gold standard was further facilitated by an additional gold loan of a hundred million dollars from J.P. Morgan Company. Winston Churchill, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, complained later that the cost to the British government of this loan was $1,125,000 the first year, this sum representing the profit to J.P. Morgan Company in that time. The matter of changing the discount rate, for instance, has never been satisfactorily explained. Inquiry at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington elicited the reply that \"the condition of the money market is the prime consideration behind changes in the rate.\" Since the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 19 6 money market is in New York, it ta kes no imagination to deduce that New York bankers may be interested in changes of the rate and often attempt to influence it. Norman Lombard, in the periodic al \"World’s Work\" writes that: \"In their consideration an d disposal of proposed changes of policy, the Federal Reserve Board should follow the procedure and ethics observed by our court of law. Suggestions that there should be a change of rate or that the Reserve Banks should buy or sell securities may come from anyone and with no formality or written argument. The suggestion may be made to a Governor or Director of the Federal Reserve System over the telephone or at his club over the luncheon table, or it may be made in the course of a casual call on a member of the Federal Reserve Board. The interests of the one proposing the change need not be revealed, an d his name and any suggestions he makes are usually kept secret. If it concerns the matter of open market operations, the public has no inkling of the decision until the regular weekly statement appears, showing changes in the holdings of the Federal Reserve Banks. Meanwhile, there is no public discussion, there is no statement of the reasons for the decision, or of the names of those opposing or favoring it.\" 123 The chances of the average citizen meeting a Governor of the Federal Reserve System at his club are also slight. The House Hearings on Stabilizatio n of the Purchasing Power of the Dollar in 1928 proved conclusively that the Federal Reserve Board worked in close cooperation with the heads of European central"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 banks, and that the Depression of 1929-31 was planned at a secret luncheon of the Federal Reserve Board and those heads of European central banks in 1927. Th e Board has never been made responsible to the public for its decisions or actions. The constitutional checks and balances seem not to operate in finance. The true allegiance of the members of the Federal Reserve Board has always been to the central bankers. The three features of the central bank, its ownership by private stockh olders who receive rent and profit for their use of the nation’s credit, absolute control of the nation’s financial resources, and mobilization of the nation’s credit to finance foreigners, all were demonstrated by the Federal Reserve System during the first fifteen years of its operations. Further demonstration of the intern ational purposes of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is provided by the \"Edge Amendment\" of December 24, 1919, which authorizes the organization of corporations expressly for \"engaging in international foreign banking and other international or foreign financial operations, including the dealing in gold or bullion, and the holding of stock in foreign corporations.\" In commenting on this amendment, E.W. Kemmerer, economist from Princeton University, remarked that: \"The federal reserve system is proving to be a great influence in the internationalizing of American trade and American finance.\" The fact that this internationalizing of American trade and American finance has been a direct cause for involving us in two world wars does not disturb Mr. Kemmerer. There is plenty of evidence to show how Paul Warburg used the Federal Reserve System as the instrument"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 19 8 for getting trade acceptance adopted on a wide scale by American businessmen. The use of trade acceptances, (which are the currency of international trade) by bankers and corporations in the United States prior to 1915 was practically unknown. The rise of the Federal Reserve System exactly parallels the increase in the use of acceptances in this country, nor is this a coincidence. The men who wanted the Federal Reserve System were the men who set up acceptance banks and profited by the use of acceptances. As early as 1910, the National Mo netary Commission began to issue pamphlets and other propaganda urging bankers and businessmen in this country to adopt trade acceptances in their transactions. For three 124 years the Commission carried on th is campaign, and the Aldrich Plan included a broad provision authorizing the introduction and use of bankers’ acceptances into the American system of commercial paper. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 as passed by Congress did not specifically authorize the use of acceptances, but the Federal Reserve Board in 1915 and 1916 defined \"trade acceptance\", further defined by Regulation A Series of 1920, and further defined by Series 1924. One of the first official ac ts of the Board of Governors in 1914 was to grant acceptances a preferentially low rate of discount at Federal Reserve Banks. Since acceptances were not be ing used in this country at that time, no explanation of business ex igency could be advanced for this"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 19 9 action. It was apparent that someone in power on the Board of Governors wanted the ad optance of acceptances. The National Bank Act of 1864, which was the determining financial authority of the United States until November, 1914, did not permit banks to lend their credit. Consequently, the power of banks to create money was greatly limited. We did not have a bank of issue, that is, a central bank, which could create money. To get a central bank, the bankers caused money panic after money panic on the business people of the United States, by shipping gold out of the country, creating a money shortage, and then importing it back. After we got our central bank, the Federal Reserv e System, there was no longer any need for a money panic, because the banks could create money. However, the panic as an instrument of power over the business and financial community was used again on two important occasions, in 1920, causing the Agricultural Depression, because state banks and trust companies had refused to join the Federal Reserve System, and in 1929, causing the Great Depression, wh ich centralized nearly all power in this country in the hands of a few great trusts. A trade acceptance is a draft drawn by the seller of goods on the purchaser, and accepted by the purchaser, with a time of expiration stamped upon it. The use of trade acceptances in the wholesale market supplies short-term, assured credit to carry goods in process of production, storage, transit, and marketing. It facilitates domestic and foreign commerce. Seemingly, then, the bankers who wished to replace the open-book account system with the trade acceptance system were progressive men who wi shed to help American import-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 export trade. Much propaganda was issued to that effect, but this was not really the story. The open-book system, heretofore used entirely by American business people, allowed a discount for cash. The acceptance system discourages the use of cash, by allowing a discount for credit. The open-book system also allowed much easier terms of payment, with liberal extensions on the debt. The acceptance does not allow this, since it is 125 a short-term credit with the time-date stamped upon it. It is out of the seller’s hands, and in the hands of a bank, usually an acceptance bank, which does not allow any extension of time. Thus, the adoption of acceptances by American businessmen during the 1920’s greatly facilitated the domination and swallo wing up of small business into huge trusts, which accelerated the crash of 1929. Trade acceptances had been used to some extent in the United States before the Civil War. During that war, exigencies of trade had destroyed the acceptance as a credit medium, and it had not come back into favor in this country, our people preferring the simplicity and generosity of the open-book system. Open-book accounts are a single-name commercial paper, bearing only the name of the debtor. Acceptances are two-name paper, bearing the name of the debtor and the creditor. Thus they became commodities to be bought and sold by banks. To the creditor, under the open-book system, the debt is a liability. To the acceptance bank holding an acceptance, the debt is an asset. The men who set up acceptance banks in this country, under the leadership of Paul Warburg, secured control of the billions of"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 201 dollars of credit existing as open accounts on the books of American businessmen. Governor Marriner Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board stated before the House Banking and Currency Committee that: \"Debt is the basis for the creation of money.\" Large holders of trade acceptances got the use of billions of dollars worth of credit-money, besides the rate of interest charged upon the acceptance itself. It is obvious why Paul Warburg should have devoted so much time, money, and energy to getting acceptances adopted by this country’s banking machinery. On September 4, 1914, the National City Bank accepted the first time- draft drawn on a national bank under provisions of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. This was the beginnin g of the end of the open-book account system as an important fa ctor in wholesale trade. Beverly Harris, vice-president of the National City Bank of New York, issued a pamphlet in 1915 stating that: \"Merchants using the open account system are usurping the functions of bankers.\" In The New York Times on June 14, 1920, Paul Warburg, Chairman of the American Acceptance Council, said: \"Unless the Federal Reserve Board puts itself heart and soul behind the untrammeled development of acceptances as a prime investment for banks of the Federal Reserve Banks the future safe and sound development of the system will be jeopardized.\""},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 202 This was a statement of the purpose of Warburg and his bunch who wanted \"monetary reform\" in this country. They were out to get control 126 of all credit in the United States, and they got it, by means of the Federal Reserve System, the acceptance system, and the lack of concern by the citizens. The First World War was a boon to the introduction of trade acceptances, and the volume jumped to four hundred million dollars in 1917, growing through the 1920s to more than a billion dollars a year, which culminated in a high peak just before the Great Depression of 1929-31. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s charts show that its use of acceptances reached a peak in November, 1929, the month of the stock market crash, and declined sharply thereafter. The acceptance people by then had gotten what they wanted, which was control of American business and industry. \"Fortune Magazine\" in February of 1950 pointed out that: \"Volume of acceptances declined from $1,732 million in 1929 to $209 million in 1940, because of the concentration of acceptance banking in a few hands, and the Treasury’s low-interest policy, which made direct loans cheaper than acceptance. There has been a slight upturn since the war, but it is often cheaper for large companies to finance imports from their own coffers.\" In other words, the \"large compan ies\" more accurately, the great trusts, now have control of credit and have not needed acceptances.

Even their flood of lectures and pamphlets proved insufficient, and in 1919 Paul Wa rburg organized the American Acceptance Council, which was de voted entirely to acceptance propaganda. The first convention held by this association at Detroit, Michigan, on June 9, 1919, coincided with the annual convention of the National Association of Credit Men, held ther e on that date, so that \"interested observers might with facility participate in the lectures and meetings of both groups,\" according to a pamphlet issued by the American Acceptance Council. Paul Warburg was elected President of this organization, and later became chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Acceptance Council, a po sition which he held until his death in 1932. The Council published lists of corporations using trade acceptances, all of them businesses in which Kuhn, Loeb Co. or its affiliates held control. Lectures given before the Council or by members of the Council were attractively bound and distributed free by the National City Bank of New York to the country’s businessmen. Louis T.

He was, from its organization in 1920 until his death in 1932, Chairman of the Board of the Internatio nal Acceptance Bank of New York, the largest acceptance bank in the world. His brother, Felix M. Warburg, also a partner in Kuhn, Loeb Co., was director of the International Accept ance Bank and Paul’s son, James Paul Warburg, was Vice-President. Paul Warburg was also a director on other important acceptance banks in this country, such as Westinghouse Acceptance Bank, which were organized in the United States immediately after the World Wa r, when the headquarters of the international acceptance market was moved from London to New York, and Paul Warburg became the most powerful acceptance banker in the world. Paul Warburg became an even more legendary figure by his memorialization as \"Daddy Warbucks\" in the comic strip, \"Little Orphan Annie\".

Those in the know snickered when \"Annie\", the musical comedy version of this story, had a highly successful run of several years on Broadway, because the vast majority of the audience had no idea that this was merely another Warburg operation. It was the transference of the acceptance market from England to this country which gave rise to Thomas Lamont’s ecstatic speech before the Academy of Political Science in 1917 that: \"The dollar, not the pound, is now the basis for international exchange.\" Americans were proud to hear that, but they did not realize at what a price. Visible proof of the undue influence of the American Acceptance Council on the Federal Reserve Board, about which Congressman McFadden complained, is the chart showing the rate-pattern of the 128 Federal Reserve Bank of New York du ring the 1920s. The Bank’s official discount rate follows exactly for nine years the ninety-day bankers’ acceptance rate, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sets the discount rate for the rest of the Reserve Banks. Throughout the 1920s the Board of Governors retained two of its first members, C.S. Hamlin and Adolph C. Miller. These men found themselves careers as arbiters of the nation’s monetary policy. Hamlin was on the Board from 1914 until 1936, when he was appointed Special Counsel to the Board, while Miller served from 1914 until 1931."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 20 6 These two men were allowed to stay on the Board so many years because they were both eminently respectable men who gave the Board a certain prestige in the eyes of the public. During these years one important banker after another came on the Board, served for awhile, and went on to better things. Neither Miller nor Hamlin ever objected to anything that the New York bankers wanted. They changed the discount rate and they performed open market operation with Government securiti es whenever Wall Street wanted them to. Behind them was the figure of Paul Warburg, who exercised a continuous and dominant influence as President of the Federal Advisory Council, on wh ich he had such men of common interests with himself as Winthrop Aldrich and J.P. Morgan. Warburg was never too occupied with his duties of organizing the big international trusts to supervise the nation’s financial structures. Hi s influence from 1902, when he arrived in this country as immigrant from Germany, until 1932, the year of his death, was dependent on his European alliance with the banking cartel. Warburg’s son, James Paul Warburg, continued to exercise such influence, being appointed Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Director of the Budget when that great man assumed office in 1933, and setting up the Office of War Information, our official propaganda agency during the Second World War.

CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Was it a social affair, or were matters of importance discussed? GOVERNOR MILLER: I would say it was mainly a social affair. Personally, I had a long conversation with Dr. Schacht alone before the luncheon, and also one of considerable length with Professor Rist. After the luncheon I began a conversation with Mr. Norman, which was joined in by Governor Strong of New York. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Was that a formal meeting of the Board? GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: No. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: It was just an informal discussion of the matters they had been discussing in New York? GOVERNOR MILLER: I assume so. It was mainly a social occasion. What I said was mainly in the nature of generalities. The heads of these central banks also spoke in generalities. MR. KING: What did they want?"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 214 GOVERNOR MILLER: They were very candid in answers to questions. I wanted to have a talk with Mr. Norman, and we both stayed behind after luncheon, and were joined by the other foreign representatives and the officials of the New York Reserve Bank. These gentlemen were all pretty concerned with the way the gold standard was working. They were therefore desirous of seeing an easy money market in New York and lower rates, which would deter gold from moving from Europe to this country. That would be very much in the interest of the international money situation which then existed. MR. BEEDY: Was there some understanding arrived at between the representatives of these foreign banks and the Federal Reserve Board or the New York Federal Reserve Bank? GOVERNOR MILLER: Yes. MR. BEEDY: It was not reported formally? GOVERNOR MILLER: No. Later, there came a meeting of the Open- Market Policy Committee, the investment policy committee of the Federal Reserve System, by which and to which certain recommendations were made. My recollection is that about eighty million dollars worth of securities we re purchased in August consistent with this plan. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Was there any conference between the members of the Open Market Co mmittee and those bankers from abroad? GOVERNOR MILLER: They may have met them as individuals, but not as a committee."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 215 134 MR. KING: How does the Open-Market Committee get its ideas?

CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Something of a very definite character took place? GOVERNOR MILLER: Yes. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: A change of policy on the part of our whole financial system which has resulted in one of the most unusual situations that has ever confronted this country financially (the stock market speculation boom of 1927-1929). It seems to me that a matter of that importance should have been made a matter of record in Washington. GOVERNOR MILLER: I agree with you. REPRESENTATIVE STRONG: Would it not have been a good thing if there had been a direction that those po wers given to th e Federal Reserve System should be used for the contin ued stabilization of the purchasing power of the American dollar rather than be influenced by the interests of Europe?"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 21 6 GOVERNOR MILLER: I take exception to that term \"influence\". Besides, there is no such thing as stabil izing the American dollar without stabilizing every other gold currency . They are tied together by the gold standard. Other eminent men wh o come here are very adroit in knowing how to approach the folk who make up the personnel of the Federal Reserve Board. MR. STEAGALL: The visit of these foreign bankers resulted in money being cheaper in New York? GOVERNOR MILLER: Yes, exactly. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: I would like to put in the record all who attended that luncheon in Washington. GOVERNOR MILLER: In addition to the names I have given you, there was also present one of the younger men from the Bank of France. I think all members of the Federal Reserve Board were there. Under Secretary of the Treasury Ogden Mills was there, and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Schuneman, also, two or three men from the State Department and Mr. Warre n of the Foreign Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Oh yes, Governor Strong was present. 135 CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: This conference, of course, with all of these foreign bankers did not just happen. The prominent bankers from Germany, France, and England ca me here at whose suggestion? GOVERNOR MILLER: A situation had been created that was distinctly embarrassing to London by reason of the impending withdrawal of a"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 217 certain amount of gold which had been recovered by France and that had originally been shipped and deposited in the Bank of England by the French Government as a war credit. There was getting to be some tension of mind in Europe be cause France was beginning to put her house in order for a return to the gold standard. This situation was one which called for some moderating influence. MR. KING: Who was the moving spirit who got those people together? GOVERNOR MILLER: That is a detail with which I am not familiar. REPRESENTATIVE STRONG: Would it not be fair to say that the fellows who wanted the gold were the ones who instigated the meeting? GOVERNOR MILLER: They came over here. REPRESENTATIVE STRONG: The fact is that they came over here, they had a meeting, they banqueted, they talked, they got the Federal Reserve Board to lower the discount rate, and to make the purchases in the open market, and they got the gold. MR. STEAGALL: Is it true that action stabilized the European currencies and upset ours? GOVERNOR MILLER: Yes, that was what it was intended to do. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Let me call your attention to the recent conference in Paris at which Mr. Gold enweiser, director of research for the Federal Reserve Board, and Dr. Burgess, assistant Federal Reserve Agent of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were in consultation with the representatives of the other central banks. Who called the conference?"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 21 8 GOVERNOR MILLER: My recollection is that it was called by the Bank of France. GOVERNOR YOUNG: No, it was the League of Nations who called them together.\" The secret meeting between the Go vernors of the Federal Reserve Board and the heads of the European central banks was not called to stabilize anything. It was held to discuss the best way of getting the gold held in the United States by the System back to Europe to force the nations of that continent back on the gold standard. The League of Nations had not yet succeeded in doing that, the objective for which that body was set up in the first place, because the Senate of the United States 136 had refused to let Woodrow Wilson betray us to an international monetary authority. It took the Second World War and Franklin D. Roosevelt to do that. Meanwhile, Europe had to have our gold and the Federal Reserve System gave it to them, five hundred million dollars worth. The movement of that gold out of the United States caused the deflation of the stock boom, the end of the business prosperity of the 1920s and the Great Depression of 1929-31, the worst calamity which has ever befallen this nation. It is entirely logical to say that the American people suffered that depr ession as a punishment for not joining the League of Nations. The bankers knew what would happen when that five hundred million do llars worth of gold was sent to Europe. They wanted the Depression because it put the business and finance of the United States in their hands."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 21 9 The Hearings continue: MR. BEEDY: \"Mr. Ebersole of the Treasury Department concluded his remarks at the dinner we attended last night by saying that the Federal Reserve System did not want stabilization and the American businessman did not want it.

If control of these people does not come in a legitimate way, there may be an attempt to produce it by general upheavals such as have characterized society in days gone by. Revolutions have been promoted by dissatisfaction wi th existing conditions, the control being in the hands of the few, and the many paying the bills.

George L. Harrison, May 19, 1928 I also desire to place in the record a statement in the New York Journal of Commerce, dated May 22, 1928, from Washington: ‘It is stated in well-informed circles here that the chief topic being taken up by Governor Strong of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on his present visit to Paris is the a rrangement of stabilization credits for France, Rumania, and Yugoslavia. A second vital question Mr. Strong will take up is the amount of gold France is to draw from this country.’\" Further questioning by Chairman Mc Fadden about the strange illness of Benjamin Strong brought forth the following testimony from Governor Charles S. Hamlin of the Federal Reserve Board on May 23rd, 1928: \"All I know is that Governor Strong has been very ill, and he has gone over to Europe primarily, I understand, as a matter of health. Of course, he knows well the various offices of the European central banks and undoubtedly will call on them.\" Governor Benjamin Strong died a few weeks after his return from Europe, without appearing before the Committee.

This had been one of the promises made by Carter Glass and Woodrow Wilson when they presented the Federal Reserve Act before Congress in 1912, and such a provision had actually been put in the Act by Se nator Robert L. Owen, but Carter Glass’ House Committee on Banking and Currency had struck it out. The traders and speculators did not want the dollar to become stable, because they would no longer be able to make a profit. The citizens of this country had been led to gamble on the stock market in the 1920s because the traders had created a nationwide condition of instability. The Strong Bill of 1928 wa s defeated in Congress. The financial situation in the United States during the 1920s was characterized by an inflation of speculative values only. It was a trader-made situation. Prices of commodities remained low, despite the over-pricing of securities on the exchange. The purchasers did not expect their securities to pay dividends. The idea was to hold them awhile and sell them at a profit. It had to stop somewhere, as Paul Warburg remarked in March, 1929. Wall Street did not let it stop until the people ha d put their savings into these over- priced securities. We had the specta cle of the President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, acting as a shill for the stock market operators when he recommended to the American people that they continue buying on the 138"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 222 market, in 1927. There had been uneasiness about the inflated condition of the market, and the bankers showed their power by getting the President of the United St ates, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue statements that brokers’ loans were not too high, and that the condition of the stock market was sound. Irving Fisher warned us in 1927 that the burden of stabilizing prices all over the world would soon fall on the United States. One of the results of the Second World War was the establishment of an International Monetary Fund to do just that. Prof essor Gustav Cassel remarked in the same year that: \"The downward movement of prices has not been a spontaneous result of forces beyond our control. It is the result of a policy deliberately framed to bring down prices and give a higher value to the monetary unit.\" The Democratic Party, after passing the Federal Reserve Act and leading us into the First World War, assumed the role of an opposition party during the 1920s. They were on the outside of the political fence, and were supported during those lean years by liberal handouts from Bernard Baruch, according to his biography. How far outside of it they were and how little chance they ha d in 1928, is shown by a plank in the official Democratic Party platform adopted at Houston on June 28, 1928: \"The administration of the Federal Reserve System for the advantage of the stock-market speculators should cease. It must be administered for the benefit of farmers, wage-earners, merchants, manufacturers, and others engaged in constructive business.\""},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 223 This idealism insured defeat for its protagonist, Al Smith, who was nominated by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The campaign against Al Smith also was marked by appeals to reli gious intolerance, because he was a Catholic. The bankers stirred up anti-Catholic sentiment all over the country to achieve the election of their World War I protégé, Herbert Hoover. Instead of being used to promote the financial stability of the country, as had been promised by Woodrow Wilson when the Act was passed, financial instability has been steadily promoted by the Federal Reserve Board. An official memorandum issued by the Board on March 13, 1939, stated that: \"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System opposes any bill which proposes a stable price level.\" Politically, the Federal Reserve Board was used to advance the election of the bankers’ candidat es during the 1920s. The \"Literary Digest\" on August 4, 1928, said, on the occasion of the Federal Reserve Board raising the rate to five percent in a Presidential year: 139 \"This reverses the politically desira ble cheap money policy of 1927, and gives smooth conditions on the stock market. It was attacked by the Peoples’ Lobby of Washington, D.C. which said that ‘This increase at a time when farmers needed cheap mo ney to finance the harvesting of their crops was a direct blow at the farmers, who had begun to get back on their feet after the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21. \"The New York World\" said on that occasion:"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 224 \"Criticism of Federal Reserve Board policy by many investors is not based on its attempt to deflate the stock market, but on the charge that the Board itself, by last year’s policy, is completely responsible for such stock market inflation as exists.\" A damning survey of the Federal Reserve System’s first fifteen years appears in the \"North American Re view\" of May, 1929, by H. Parker Willis, professional economist who was one of the authors of the Act and First Secretary of the Board fr om 1914 until 1920. He expresses complete disillusionment. \"My first talk with President-elect Wilson was in 1912. Our conversation related entirely to banking reform. I asked whether he felt confident we could secure the administration of a suitable law and how we should get it applied and enforced. He answered: ‘We must rely on American business idealism.’ He sought for something which could be trusted to afford opportunity to Am erican Idealism. It did serve to finance the World War and to revise American banking practices. The element of idealism that the Pres ident prescribed and believed we could get on the principle of noblesse oblige from American bankers and businessmen was not there. Since the inauguration of the Federal Reserve Act we have suffered one of the most serious financial depressions and revolutions ever known in our history, that of 1920-21. We have seen our agriculture pass through a long period of suffering and even of revolution, during which one million farmers left their farms, du e to difficulties with the price of land and the odd status of credit conditions. We have suffered the most extensive era of bank failures ever known in this country. Forty-five hundred banks have closed their doors since the Reserve System"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 225 began functioning. In some Western towns there have been times when all banks in that community failed, and given banks have failed over and over again. There has been little difference in liability to failure between members and non- members of the Federal Reserve System. \"Wilson’s choice of the first members of the Federal Reserve Board was not especially happy. They represented a composite grou p chosen for the express purpose of placating this, that, or the other big interest. It was not strange that appointees used their places to pay debts. When the Board was considering a resolution to the effect that future members of the reserve system should be appointed solely on merit, because of the demonstrated incompetence of some of their number. Comptroller John Skelton Williams move d to strike out the word ‘solely’ and in this he was sustained by the Board. The inclusion of certain elements (Warburg, 140 Strauss, etc.) in the Board gave an opportunity for catering to special interests that was to prove disastrous later on. \"President Wilson erred, as he often erred, in supposing that the holding of an important office would transform an incumbent and revivify his patriotism. The Reserve Board reached the low ebb of the Wilson period with the appointment of a member who was chosen for his ability to get delegates for a Democrat ic candidate for the Presidency. However, this level was not the dregs reached under President Harding. He appointed an old crony, D.R. Crissinger, as"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 22 6 Governor of the Board, and named several other super-serviceable politicians to other places. Before his death he had done his utmost to debauch the whole undertaking. The System has gone steadily downhill ever since. \"Reserve Banks had hardly assumed their first form when it became apparent that local bankers had sought to use them as a means of taking care of ‘favorite sons’, that is, persons who had by common consent become a kind of gene ral charge upon the banking community, or inefficients of various kinds. When reserve directors were to be chosen, the country bankers often refused to vote, or, when they voted, cast their ballots as directed by city correspondents. In these circumstances popular or democratic control of reserve banks was out of the question. Reasonable efficiency might have been secured if honest men, recognizing their public duty, had assumed power. If such men existed, they did not get on the Federal Reserve Board. In one reserve bank today the chief management is in the hands of a man who never did a day’s actual bankin g in his life, while in another reserve institution both Governor and Chairman are the former heads of now defunct banks. They naturally have a high failure record in their district. In a majority of districts the standard of performance as judged by good banking standards is disgracefully low among reserve executive officials. The policy of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is known in the System as the ‘Friends and Relatives Banks.’ \"It was while making war profits in considerable amounts that someone conceived the idea of using the profits to provide themselves with phenomenally costly buildings. Today the Reserve Banks must keep a"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 227 full billion dollars of their money cons tantly at work merely to pay their own expenses in normal times. \"The best illustration of what the System has done and not done is offered by the experience which the country was having with speculation, in May, 1929. Three years prior to that, the present bull market was just getting under way. In the autumn of 1926 a group of bankers, among them one of world famous name, were sitting at a table in a Washington hotel. One of them raised the question whether the low discount rates of the System were not likely to encourage speculation. \"‘Yes’, replied the famous banker, ‘they will, but that cannot be helped. It is the price we must pay for helping Europe.’ \"It may well be questioned whether the encouragement of speculation by the Board has been the price paid for helping Europe or whether 141 it is the price paid to induce a certain class of financiers to help Europe, but in either case European conditions should not have had anything to do with the Board’s discount policy. The fact of the matter is that the Federal Reserve Banks do not come into contact with the community. \"The ‘small man’ from Maine to Texa s has gradually been led to invest his savings in the stock market, with the result that the rising tide of speculation, transacted at a higher and higher rate of speed, has swept over the legitimate business of the country."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 22 8 \"In March, 1928, Roy A. Young, Governor of the Board, was called before a Senate committee. ‘Do you think the brokers’ loan s are too high?\", he was asked. \"‘I am not prepared to say whether brokers’ loans are too high or too low,’ he replied, ‘but I am sure they are safely and conservatively made.’ \"Secretary of the Treasury Mellon in a formal statement assured the country that they were not too high, and Coolidge, using material supplied him by the Federal Reserve Board, made a plain statement to the country that they were not too high. The Federal Reserve Board, charged with the duty of protecting the interests of the average man, thus did its utmost to assure the average man that he should feel no alarm about his savings. Yet the Federal Reserve Board issued on February 2, 1929, a letter addressed to the Reserve Bank Directors cautioning them against grave danger of further speculation. \"What could be expected from a group of men such as composed the Board, a set of men who were solely interested in standing from under when there was any danger of friction, displaying a bovine and canine appetite for credit and praise, while eager only to ‘stand in’ with the ‘big men’ whom they know as the masters of American finance and banking?\" H.

Hawtrey, the English economist, said, in the March, 1926 American Economic Review: \"When external investment outstrip s the supply of general savings the investment market must carry the excess with money borrowed from the banks. A remedy is control of credit by a rise in bank rate.\" The Federal Reserve Board applied this control of credit, but not in 1926, nor as a remedial measure. It was not applied until 1929, and then the rate was raised as a punitive measure, to freeze out everybody but the big trusts. Professor Cassel, in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 1928, wrote that: \"The fact that a central bank fails to raise its bank rate in accordance with the actual situation of the capital market very much increases the strength of the cyclical movement of trade, with all its pernicious effects on social economy. A rational regulation of the bank rate lies in our hands, and may be accomplished only if we perceive its importance and decide to go in for such a policy. With a bank rate regulated on these lines the conditions for the development of trade cycles would be radically altered, and indeed, our familiar trade cycles would be a thing of the past.\" This is the most authoritative pr emise yet made relating that our business depressions are artificially precipitated. The occurrence of the"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 230 Panic of 1907, the Agricultural De pression of 1920, and the Great Depression of 1929, all three in go od crop years and in periods of national prosperity, suggests that premise is not guesswork. Lord Maynard Keynes pointed out that most theories of the business cycle failed to relate their analysis adequately to the money mechanism. Any survey or study of a depression which failed to list such factors as gold movements and pressures on foreign exchange would be worthless, yet American economists have always dodged this issue. The League of Nations had achieved its goal of getting the nations of Europe back on the gold standard by 1928, but three-fourths of the world’s gold was in France and the United States. The problem was how to get that gold to countries wh ich needed it as a basis for money and credit. The answer was action by the Federal Reserve System. 143 Following the secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board and the heads of the foreign central banks in 1927, the Federal Reserve Banks in a few months doubled their holdings of Government securities and acceptances, which resulted in the exportation of five hundred million dollars in gold in that year. The Sy stem’s market activities forced the rates of call money down on the Stock Exchange, and forced gold out of the country. Foreigners also took this opportunity to purchase heavily in Government securities because of the low call money rate. \"The agreement between the Bank of England and the Washington Federal Reserve authorities many months ago was that we would force the export of 725 million of gold by reducing the bank rates here, thus helping the stabilization of France and Europe and putting France on a gold basis.\"89 (April 20, 1928)"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 231 On February 6, 1929, Mr. Montagu No rman, Governor of the Bank of England, came to Washington and had a conference with Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury. Immediately after that mysterious visit, the Federal Reserve Board abruptly changed its policy and pursued a high discount rate policy, abandoning the cheap money policy which it had inaugurated in 1927 after Mr. Norman’s other visit. The stock market crash and the deflation of the American people’s financial structure was scheduled to take place in March. To get the ball rolling, Paul Warburg gave the o fficial warning to the traders to get out of the market. In his annual report to the stockholders of his International Acceptance Bank, in March, 1929, Mr. Warburg said: \"If the orgies of unrestrained speculation are permitted to spread, the ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves, but to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.\" During three years of \"unrestraine d speculation\", Mr. Warburg had not seen fit to make any remarks about the condition of the Stock Exchange. A friendly organ, The New York Times, not only gave the report two columns on its editorial page, but editorially commented on the wisdom and profundity of Mr. Warburg’s observations. Mr. Warburg’s concern was genuine, for the stock market bubble had gone much farther than it had been intended to go, and the bankers feared the consequences if the people realized what was going on. When this report in The New York Times started a sudden wave of selling on the Exchange, the bankers grew panicky, and it was decided to ease the market somewhat.

On April 20, 1929, the Times headlined, \"Federal Advisory Council Mystery __________________________ 89 Clarence W.

Evasive replies were given to newspaper correspondents.\" Only the innermost council of \"The London Connection\" knew that it had been decided at this \"mystery meeting\" to bring down the curtain on the greatest speculative boom in American history. Those in the know began to sell off all speculative stocks and put their money in government bonds. Those who were not privy to this secret information, and they included some of the wealthiest men in America, continued to hold their spec ulative stocks and lost everything they had."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 233 In FDR, My Exploited Father-in-Law, Col. Curtis B. Dall, who was a broker on Wall Street at that time, writes of the Crash, \"Actually it was the calculated ‘shearing’ of the public by the World Money-Powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of the supply of call money in the New York money market.\"90 Overnight, the Federal Reserve System had raised the call rate to twenty percent. Unable to meet this rate, the speculators’ only alternative was to jump out of windows. The New York Federal Reserve Bank rate, which dictated the national interest rate, went to six percent on November 1, 1929. After the investors had been bankrupted, it dropped to one and one-half percent on May 8, 1931. Congressman Wright Patman in \"A Primer On Money\", says that the money supply decreased by eight billion dollars from 1929 to 1933, causing 11,630 banks of the total of 26,401 in the United States to go bank rupt and close their doors. The Federal Reserve Board had already warned the stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks to get out of the Market, on February 6, 1929, but it had not bothered to say anything to the rest of the people. Nobody knew what was going on except the Wall Street bankers who were running the show. Gold moveme nts were completely unreliable. The Quarterly Journal of Economics noted that: \"The question has been raised, not only in this country, but in several European countries, as to whethe r customs statistics record with accuracy the movements of precious metals, and, when investigation has been made, confidence in such figures has been weakened rather than strengthened. Any movement between France and England, for instance, should be recorded in each country, but such comparison shows an average yearly discrepancy of fifty million francs"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 234 for France and eighty-five million francs for England.

The gold standard can be, and is, usefully managed and controlled for the benefit of a small group of international traders.\" In August 1929, the Federal Reserv e Board raised the rate to six percent. The Bank of England in the next month raised its rate from five and one-half percent to six and one-half percent. Dr. Friday in the September, 1929, issue of Review of Reviews, could find no reason for the Board’s action: \"The Federal Reserve statement for August 7, 1929, shows that signs of inadequacy for autumn requirements do not exist. Gold resources are considerably more than th e previous year, and gold continues to move in, to the financial embarrassment of Germany and England.

Increasing the rate means that not only is there danger of drawing gold from abroad, but imports of the yellow metal have been in progress for the last four months. To do anything to accentuate this is to take the responsibility for bringing on a world-wide credit deflation.\" Thus we find that not only was th e Federal Reserve System responsible for the First World War, which it made possible by enabling the United States to finance the Allies, but its policies brought on the world-wide depression of 1929-31. Governor Adolph C. Miller stated at the Senate Investigation of the Federal Reserve Board in 1931 that: \"If we had had no Federal Reserve System, I do not think we would have had as bad a speculative situation as we had, to begin with.\" Carter Glass replied, \"You have made it clear that the Federal Reserve Board provided a terrific credit expansion by these open market transactions.\" Emmanuel Goldenweiser said, \"In 1928-29 the Federal Board was engaged in an attempt to restrain the rapid increase in security loans and in stock market speculation. The continuity of this policy of restraint, however, was interrupted by reduction in bill rates in the autumn of 1928 and the summer of 1929.\" Both J.P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb Co. had \"preferred lists\" of men to whom they sent advance announcements of profitable stocks. The men on these preferred lists were allowed to purchase these stocks at cost, that is, anywhere from 2 to 15 points a share less than they were sold to the public.

How the big bankers operated in 146 1929 is revealed by a Newsweek story on May 30, 1936, when a Roosevelt appointee, Ralph W.

He sold his Texas utilities stock to Insu ll for ten million dollars, and in 1929 called a meeting and ordered his banks to close out all security loans by September 1.

There had been some warnings of the approaching crash in England, which American newspapers never sa w.

When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised its rate to six percent on August 9, 1929, ma rket conditions began which culminated in tremendous selling orders from October 24 into November, which wiped ou t a hundred and sixty billion dollars worth of security values. That was a hundred and sixty billions which the American citizens had one month and did not have the next. Some idea of the calamity may be had if we remember that our enormous outlay of money and goods in the Second World War amounted to not much more than two hundred billions of dollars, and a great deal of that remained as negotiable securiti es in the national debt.

Professor Oliver M.W. Sprague of Harvard University remarked of the crash: \"We have here a beautiful laborato ry case of the stock market’s dropping apparently from its own weight.\" It was pointed out that there was no exhaustion of credit, as in 1893, nor any currency famine, as in the Panic of 1907, when clearing-house certificates were resorted to, nor a collapse of commodity prices, as in 1920. What then, had caused the crash? The people had purchased stocks at high prices and expected the prices to continue to rise. The prices had to come down, and they did. It was obvious to the economists and bankers gathered over their brandy and cigars at the Hotel Astor that the people were at fault. Certainly the people had made a mistake in buying over-pri ced securities, but they had been talked into it by every leading citi zen from the President of the United States on down. Every magazine of national circulation, every big newspaper, and every prominent banker, economist, and politician, had joined in the big confidence game of urging people to buy those over-priced securities.

In 1929 J.P. Morgan Company organized the giant food trust, Standard Brands. There was an unequaled opportunity for trust operators to enlarge and co nsolidate their holdings. Emmanuel Goldenweiser, director of research for the Federal Reserve System, said, in 1947: \"It is clear in retrospect that the Board should have ignored the speculative expansion and allowed it to collapse of its own weight.\" This admission of error eighteen ye ars after the event was small comfort to the people who lost their savings in the Crash. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was the beginning of a world-wide credit deflation which lasted through 1932, and from which the Western democracies did not recover until th ey began to rearm for the Second World War.

Meyer had been a Special Advisor to the War Industries Board on Non-Ferrous Metals (gold, silver, etc.); Special Assistant to the Secretary of War on aircraft produc tion; in 1917 he was appointed to the National Committee on War Savings, and was made Chairman of the War Finance Corporation from 1918-1926. He then was appointed chairman of the Federal Farm Loan Board from 1927-29. Hoover put him on the Federal Reserve Board in 1930, and Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Reconstruction Bank fo r Reconstruction and Development in 1946. Meyer must have been a man of exceptional abil ity to hold so many important posts. However, there were some Senators who did not believe he should hold any Go vernment office, because of his family background as an international gold dealer and his mysterious operations in billions of dollars of Government securities in the First World War. Consequently, the Senate held Hearings to determine whether Meyer ought to be on the Federal Reserve Board. At these Hearings, Representative Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, said: \"Eugene Meyer, Jr. has had his own crowd with him in the government since he started in 1917."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 244 His War Finance Corporation personnel took over the Federal Farm Loan System, and almost immediately afterwards, the Kansas City Join Stock Land Bank and the Ohio Joint Stock Land Bank failed.\" REPRESENTATIVE RAINEY: Mr. Meyer, when he nominally resigned as head of the Federal Farm Loan Board, did not really cease his activities there. He left behind him an able body of wreckers. They are continuing his policies and consulting with him. Before his appointment, he was frequently in consultation with Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Dewey. Just before his appointment, the Chicago Joint Land Stock Bank, the Dallas Joint Stock Land Bank, the Kansas City Joint Land Stock Bank, and the Des Moines Land Bank were all functioning. Their bonds 151 were selling at par. The then farm commissioner had an understanding with Secretary Dewey that nothing would be done without the consent and approval of the Federal Farm Lo an Board. A few days afterwards, United States Marshals, with pistols strapped at their sides, and sometimes with drawn pistols, entered these five banks and demanded that the banks be turned over to them. Word went out all over the United States, through the newspapers, as to what had happened, and these banks were ruined. This led to the breach with the old Federal Farm Loan Board, and to the resignation of three of its members, and the appointment of Mr. Meyer to be head of that Board. SENATOR CAREY: Who authorized the marshals to take over the banks?"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" 245 REP. RAINEY: Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Dewey. That started the ruin of all these rural banks, and the Gianninis bought them up in great numbers.\" World’s Work of February 1931, said: \"When the World War began for us in 1917, Mr. Eugene Meyer, Jr. was among the first to be called to Washington. In April, 1918, President Wilson named him Director of the War Finance Corporation. This corporation loaned out 700 million dollars to banking and financial institutions.\" The Senate Hearings on Eugene Meyer, Jr. continued: REPRESENTATIVE MCFADDEN: \"Lazard Freres, the international banking house of New York and Paris, was a Meyer family banking house. It frequently figures in imports and exports of gold, and one of the important functions of the Federal Reserve System has to do with gold movements in the maintenance of it s own operations. In looking over the minutes of the hearing we had last Thursday, Senator Fletcher had asked Mr. Meyer, ‘Have you any connections with international banking?’ Mr. Meyer had answered, ‘Me? Not personally.’ This last question and answer do not appear in the stenographic transcript. Senator Fletcher remembers asking th e question and the answer. It is an odd omission. SENATOR BROOKHART: I understand that Mr. Meyer looked it over for corrections. REPRESENTATIVE MCFADDEN: Mr. Meyer is a brother-in-law of George Blumenthal, a member of the firm of J.P.

Edmund Platt, who had eight years to go on a term of ten years as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, resigned to make room for Mr. Meyer.

Eugene Meyer, Jr. as head of the War Finance Corporation, engaged in the placing of two billion dollars in Government 152 securities, placed many of those or ders first with the banking house now located at 14 Wall Street in the name of Eugene Meyer, Jr. Mr. Meyer is now a large stockholder in the Allied Chemical Corporation. I call your attention to House Repo rt No. 1635, 68th Congress, 2nd Session, which reveals that at least twenty-four million dollars in bonds were duplicated. Ten billion dollars worth of bonds surreptitiously destroyed. Our committee on Banking and Currency found the records of the War Finance Corporation under Eugene Meyer, Jr. extremely faulty. While the books were being brought before our committee by the people who were custodians of them and taken back to the Treasury at night, the committee discovered that alterations were being made in the permanent records.\" The record of public service did not prevent Eugene Meyer, Jr. from continuing to serve the American people on the Federal Reserve Board, as Chairman of the Reconstr uction Finance Corporation, and as head of the International Bank. President Rand, of the Marine Midland Corporation, questioned about his sudden desire for the services of Edmund Platt, said:"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" 247 \"We pay Mr. Platt $22,000 a year, and we took his secretary over, of course.\" This meant anothe r five thousand a year. Senator Brookhart showed that Euge ne Meyer, Jr. administered the Federal Farm Loan Board against the interests of the American farmer, saying: \"Mr. Meyer never loaned more than 180 million dollars of the capital stock of 500 million dollars of the farm loan board, so that in aiding the farmers he was not even able to use half of the capital.\" MR. MEYER: Senator Kenyon wrote me a letter which showed that I cooperated with great advant age to the people of Iowa. SENATOR BROOKHART: \"You went out and took the opposite side from the Wall Street crowd. They always send somebody out to do that. I have not yet discovered in your statements much interest in making loans to the farmers at large, or any real effort to help their condition. In your two years as head of the Federal Farm Loan Board you made very few loans compared to your capital. You loaned only one-eighth of the demand, according to your own statement.\" Despite the damning evidence uncovered at these Senate Hearings, Eugene Meyer, Jr. remained on the Federal Reserve Board. During this tragic period, chairm an Louis McFadden of the House Banking and Currency Committee cont inued his lone crusade against the \"London Connection\" which had wrecked the nation. On June 10, 1932, McFadden addressed the House of Representatives:"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 24 8 \"Some people think the Federal Reserve banks are United States Government institutions.

Henry Ford has said, ‘The one aim of these financiers is world control by the creation of inextinguishable debt s.’ The truth is the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the Government of the United States by the arrogant credit monopoly which operates the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks.\" On January 13, 1932, McFadden had introduced a resolution indicting the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for \"Criminal Conspiracy\": \"Whereas I charge them, jointly and severally, with the crime of having treasonably conspired and acted against the peace and security of the United States and havi ng treasonably conspired to destroy constitutional government in the United States.

Only five Congressmen st ood with him on this, and the"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 24 9 resolution failed. The Republican majority leader of the House remarked, \"Louis T.

A whispering campaign that McFadden was insane swept Washington, and in the next Congressional elections, he wa s overwhelmingly defeated by thousands of dollars poured into his home district of Canton, Pennsylvania. In 1932, the American people electe d Franklin D. Roosevelt President of the United States.

As Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I, because of old school ties, he had intervened to prevent prosecution of a large ring of homosexuals in the Navy which included several Groton and Harvard chums. This brought him to the favorable appreciation of a wealthy international homosexual set which travelled back an d forth between New York and Paris, and which was presided over by Bessie Marbury, of a very old and prominent New York family. Bessie’s \"wife\", who lived with her for a number of years, was Elsie de Wolfe, later Lady Mendl in a \"mariage de convenance\", the arbiter of the international set. They recruited J.P. Morgan’s youngest daughter, Anne Morgan, into their circle, and used her fortune to restore the Villa Trianon in Paris, which became their headquarters. During World War I, it was used as a hospital. Bessie Marbury expected to be awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government as a reward, but J.P. Morgan, Jr., who despised her for corrupting his youngest sister, requested the French Government to withhold the award, which they did. Smarting from this rebuff, Bessie Marbury threw herself into politics, and became a power in the Democratic National Party. She had also recruited Eleanor Roosevelt into her circle, and, during a visit to Hyde Park, Eleanor confided that she was desperate to find something for \"poor Franklin\" to do, as he was confined to a wheelchair, and was very depressed. \"I know what we’ll do,\" exclaimed Be ssie, \"We’ll run him for Governor of New York!\" Because of her power, she succeeded in this goal, and Roosevelt later became President.

There was a great deal of criticism of this appointment, and Mr. Roosevelt, in keeping with his new role as defender of the people, sent Earl Bailie back to @bringing in New York. Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was an international banker of ill repute, having floated large issues of foreig n bonds in this country in the 1920s. These bonds defaulted, and our citizens lost millions of dollars, but they still wanted Mr. Roosevelt as President. The New York Directory of Directors lists Mr. Roosevelt as President and Director of United European Investors, Ltd., in 1923 and 1924, which floated many millions of German marks in this country, all of which defaulted. Poor’s Directory of Directors lists him as a director of The International Germanic Trust Company in 1928. Fran klin D. Roosevelt was also an advisor to the 155 Federal International Banking Corporation, an Anglo-American outfit dealing in foreign securities in the United States. Roosevelt’s law firm of Roosevelt and O’Connor during the 1920s represented many international corporations. His law partner, Basil O’Connor, was a director in the following corporations: Cuban-American Manganese Corpor ation, Venezuela-Mexican Oil Corporation, West Indies Sugar Corporation, American Reserve Insurance Corporation, Warm Spring s Foundation. He was director in other corporations, and later he ad of the Amer ican Red Cross."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 252 When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as President of the United States, he appointed as Director of the Budget James Paul Warburg, son of Paul Warburg, and Vice President of the International Acceptance Bank and other corpor ations. Roosevelt appointed as Secretary of the Treasury W.H. Woodin, one of the biggest industrialists in the country, Director of the American Car Foundry Company and numerous other locomo tive works, Remington Arms, The Cuba Company, Consolidated Cuba Railroads, and other big corporations. Woodin was later replaced by Henry Morgenthau, Jr., son of the Harlem real estate operator who had helped put Woodrow Wilson in the White House. With such a crew as this, Roosevelt’s promises of radical social changes showed little likelihood of fulfillment. One of the first things he did was to declare a bankers’ moratorium, to help the bankers get their records in order. World’s Work says: \"Congress has left Charles G. Dawes and Eugene Meyer, Jr. free to appraise, by their own methods, the security which prospective borrowers of the two billion dollar capital may offer.\" Roosevelt also set up th e Securities Exchange Commission, to see to it that no new faces got into the Wall Street gang, which caused the following colloquy in Congress: REPRESENTATIVE WOLCOTT: At hearin gs before this committee in 1933, the economists showed us charts wh ich proved beyond all doubt that the dollar value commodities followed the price level of gold.

LEON HENDERSON: No."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" 253 REPRESENTATIVE GIFFORD: Wasn’t Joe Kennedy put in [as Chairman of the Securities Exchange Committee] by President Roosevelt because he was sympathetic with big business? LEON HENDERSON: I think so. Paul Einzig pointed out in 1935 that: 156 \"President Roosevelt was the first to declare himself openly in favor of a monetary policy aiming at a deliberately engineer ed rise in prices. In a negative sense his policy was successful. Between 1933 and 1935 he succeeded in reducing private indebtedness, but this was done at the cost of increasing public indebtedness.\" In other words, he eased the burden of debts off of the rich onto the poor, since the rich are few and the poor many. Senator Robert L. Owen, testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1938, said: \"I wrote into the bill which was introd uced by me in the Senate on June 26, 1913, a provision that the powe rs of the System should be employed to promote a stable price level, which meant a dollar of stable purchasing, debt-paying power. It was stricken out. The powerful money interests got control of the Federal Reserve Board through Mr. Paul Warburg, Mr. Albert Strauss, and Mr. Adolph C. Miller and they were able to have that secret meeting of May 18, 1920, and bring about a contraction of credit so violent it threw five million people out of employment.

The same people, unrestrained in the stock"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 254 market, expanding credit to a great excess between 1926 and 1929, raised the price of stocks to a fantastic point where they could not possibly earn dividends, and when the people realized this, they tried to get out, resulting in the Crash of October 24, 1929.\" Senator Owen did not go into the question of whether the Federal Reserve Board could be held responsible to the public. Actually, they cannot. They are public officials wh o are appointed by the President, but their salaries are paid by the private stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks. Governor W.P.G. Harding of the Federal Reserve Board testified in 1921 that: \"The Federal Reserve Bank is an institution owned by the stockholding member banks. The Government has not a dollar ’s worth of stock in it.\" However, the Government does give the Federal Reserve System the use of its billions of dollars of credit, and this gives the Federal Reserve its characteristic of a central bank, the power to issue currency on the Government’s credit. We do not have Federal Government notes or gold certificates as currency. We have Federal Reserve Bank notes, issued by the Federal Reserve Banks, and every dollar they print is a dollar in their pocket. W. Randolph Burgess, of the Federa l Reserve Bank of New York, stated before the Academy of Poli tical Science in 1930 that: \"In its major principles of operation the Federal Reserve System is no different from other banks of issue, such as the Bank of England, the Bank of France, or the Reichsbank.\""},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 255 157 All of these central banks have the power of issuing currency in their respective countries. Thus, the peop le do not own their own money in Europe, nor do they own it here. It is privately printed for private profit. The people have no sovereignty over their money, and it has developed that they have no sove reignty over other major political issues such as foreign policy. As a central bank of issue, the Fede ral Reserve System has behind it all the enormous wealth of the American people. When it began operations in 1913, it created a seri ous threat to the central banks of the impoverished countries of Europe. Because it represented this great wealth, it attracted far more gold than was desirable in the 1920s, and it was apparent that soon all of the world’ s gold would be piled up in this country. This woul d make the gold standard a joke in Europe, because they would have no gold over there to back their issue of money and credit. It was th e Federal Reserve’s avowed aim in 1927, after the secret meeting with the heads of the foreign central banks, to get large quantities of that gold sent back to Europe, and its methods of doing so, the low interest rate and heavy purchases of Government securities, which created vast sums of new money, intensified the stock market speculation and made the stock market crash and resultant depression a national disaster. Since the Federal Reserve System was guilty of causing this disaster, we might suppose that they would have tried to alleviate it. However, through the dark years of 1931 and 1932, the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board saw the plight of the American people worsening and did nothing to help them. This was more criminal than the original"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 25 6 plotting of the Depression. Anyone wh o lived through those years in this country remembers the widespread unemployment, the misery, and the hunger of our people. At any ti me during those years the Federal Reserve Board could have acted to relieve this situation. The problem was to get so me money back into circulation. So much of the money normally used to pay rent and food bills had been sucked into Wall Street that there was no money to carry on the business of living. In many areas, people pr inted their own money on wood and paper for use in their communities, and this money was good, since it represented obligations to each other which people fulfilled. The Federal Reserve System was a central bank of issue. It had the power to, and did, when it suited its owners, issue millions of dollars of money. Why did it not do so in 1931 and 1932? The Wall Street bankers were through with Mr. Herbert Hoov er, and they wanted Franklin D. Roosevelt to come in on a wave of glory as the saviour of the nation. Therefore, the American people had to starve and suffer until March of 1933, when the White Knight came riding in with his crew of Wall Street 158 bribers and put some money into circulation. That was all there was to it. As soon as Mr. Roosevelt took office, the Federal Reserve began to buy Government securities at the rate of ten million dollars a week for ten weeks, and created a hundred million dollars in new money, which alleviated the critical famine of money and credit, and the factories started hiring people again. During the Roosevelt Administration, The Federal Reserve Board, insofar as the public was concerned, was Marriner Eccles, an emulator and"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 257 admirer of \"the Chief\". Eccles was a Utah banker, President of the First Securities Corporation, a family inve stment trust consisting of a number of banks which Eccles had picked up cheap during the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21. Eccl es also was a director of such corporations as Pet Milk Company, Mountain States Implement Company, and Amalgamated Sugar. As a big banker, Eccles fitted in well with the group of powerful men who were operating Roosevelt. There was some discussion in Congress as to whether Eccles ought to be on the Federal Reserve Board at the same time he had all of these banks in Utah, but he testified that he had very little to do with the First Securities Corporation besides being President of it, and so he was confirmed as Chairman of the Board. Eugene Meyer, Jr. now resigned from the Board to spend more of his time lending the two billion dollar capital of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and determining the value of collateral by his own methods. The Banking Act of 1935, which greatly increased Roosevelt’s power over the nation’s finances, was an in tegral part of the legislation by which he proposed to extend his reig n in the United States. It was not opposed by the people as was the National Recovery Act, because it was not so naked an infringement of their liberties. It was, however, an important measure. First of all, it extended the terms of office of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to fourteen years, or, three and a half times the length of a Presidential term. This meant that a President assuming office who might be hostil e to the Board could not appoint a majority to it who would be favorabl e to him. Thus, a monetary policy"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 25 8 inaugurated before a President came into the White House would go on regardless of his wishes. The Banking Act of 1935 also repealed the clause of the Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933, which had prov ided that a banking house could not be on the Stock Exchange and also be involved in investment banking. This clause was a good one, since it prevented a banking house from lending money to a corporation which it owned. Still it is to be remembered that this clause co vered up some other provisions in that Act, such as the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, providing insurance mo ney to the amount of 150 million dollars, to 159 guarantee fifteen billion dollars worth of deposits. This increased the power of the big bankers over sm all banks and gave them another excuse to investigate them. The Banking Act of 1933 also legislated that all earnings of the Federal Reserve Banks must by law go to the banks themselves. At last the provision in the Act that the Government share in the profits was gotten rid of. It had never been observed, and the increase in the assets of the Federal Reserve Banks from 143 million dollars in 1913 to 45 billion dollars in 1949 went entirely to the private stockholders of the banks. Thus, th e one constructive provision of the Banking Act of 1933 was repealed in 1935, and also the Federal Reserve Banks were now permitted to loan directly to industry, competing with the member banks, who could not hope to match their capacity in arranging large loans."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 25 9 When the provision that banks could not be involved in investment banking and operate on the Stock Exchange was repealed in 1935, Carter Glass, originator of that provision, was asked by reporters: \"Does that mean that J.P. Morgan can go back into investment banking?\" \"Well, why not?\" replied Senator Glass. \"There has been an outcry all over the country that the banks will not make loans. Now the Morgans can go back to underwriting.\" Because that provision was unfavorable to them, the bankers had simply clamped down on making loans until it was repealed. Newsweek of March 14, 1936, noted that: \"The Federal Reserve Bo ard fired nine chairmen of Reserve Banks, explaining that ‘it intended to make the chairmanships of the Reserve Banks largely a part-time job on an honorary basis.’\" This was another instance of the centralization of control in the Federal Reserve System. The regional district system had never been an important factor in the administration of monetary policy, and the Board was not cutting down on its officials outside of Washington. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had asked, during the Gold Reserve Hearings of 1934: \"Is it not true, Governor Young, that the Secretary of the Treasury for the past twelve years has dominated the policy of the Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve Board with respect to the purchase of United States bonds?\""},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 260 Governor Young had denied this, but it had already been brought out that on both of his hurried trips to this country in 1927 and 1929 to dictate Federal Reserve policy, Governor Montagu Norman of the Bank of England had gone directly to Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury, to get him to purchase Go vernment securities on the open market and start the movement of go ld out of this country back to Europe. 160 The Gold Reserve Hearings had also brought in other people who had more than a passing interest in the operations of the Federal Reserve System. James Paul Warburg, just back from the London Economic Conference with Professor O.M.W. Sprague and Henry L. Stimson, came in to declare that he thought we ought to modernize the gold standard. Frank Vanderlip suggested that we do away with the Federal Reserve Board and set up a Federal Monetary Authority. This would have made no difference to the New York bankers, who would have selected the personnel anyway. And Senator Robert L. Owen, longtime critic of the system, made the following statement: \"The people did not know the Fede ral Reserve Banks were organized for profit-making. They were intended to stabilize the credit and currency supply of the country. That end has not been accomplished. Indeed, there has been the most remarkable variation in the purchasing power of money since the System went into effect. The Federal Reserve men are chosen by the big banks, through discreet little campaigns, and they naturally follow the ideals which are portrayed to them as the soundest from a financial point of view.\""},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 261 Benjamin Anderson, economist for the Chase National Bank of New York, said: \"At the moment, 1934, we have 900 milli on dollars excess reserves. In 1924, with increased reserves of 300 million, y ou got some three or four billion in bank expansion of credit very quickly. That extra money was put out by the Federal Reserve Banks in 1924 through buying government securities and was the cause of the rapid expansion of bank credit. The banks continued to get excess reserves because more gold came in, and because, whenever there was a slackening, the Federal Reserve people would put out some more. They held back a bit in 1926. Things firmed up a bit that year. An d then in 1927 they put out less than 300 million additional reserves, set the wild stock market going, and that led us right into the smash of 1929.\" Dr. Anderson also stated that: \"The money of the Federa l Reserve Banks is money they created. When they buy Government securities they create re serves. They pay for the Government securities by giving checks on themselves, and those checks come to the commercial banks and are by them deposited in the Federal Reserve Banks, and then money exists which did not exist before.\" SENATOR BULKLEY: It does not increa se the circulating medium at all? ANDERSON: No. This is an explanation of the manner in which the Federal Reserve Banks increased their assets from 143 million dollars to 45 billion dollars"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 262 in thirty-five years. They did no t produce anything, they were non- productive enterprises, and yet they had this enormous profit, merely by creating money, 95 percent of it in the form of credit, which did not add 161 to the circulating medium. It was not distributed among the people in the form of wages, nor did it increa se the buying power of the farmers and workers. It was credit-money created by bankers for the use and profit of bankers, who increased their wealth by more than forty billion dollars in a few years because th ey had obtained control of the Government’s credit in 1913 by passing the Fede ral Reserve Act. Marriner Eccles also had much to say about the creation of money. He considered himself an economist, and had been brought into the Government service by Stuart Chase and Rexford Guy Tugwell, two of Roosevelt’s early brain-trusters. Eccles was the only one of the Roosevelt crowd who stayed in office throughout his administration. Before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 24, 1941, Governor Eccles said: \"Money is created out of the right to issue credit-money.\" Turning over the Government’s credit to private bankers in 1913 gave them unlimited opportunities to create money. The Federal Reserve System could also destroy money in large quantities through open market operations. Eccles said, at the Silv er Hearings of 1939: \"When you sell bonds on the open market, you extinguish reserves.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 263 Extinguishing reserves means wiping out a basis for money and credit issue, or, tightening up on money and credit, a condition which is usually even more favorable to bank ers than the creation of money. Calling in or destroying money gives the banker immediate and unlimited control of the financial situat ion, since he is the only one with money and the only one with the po wer to issue money in a time of money shortage. The money pani cs of 1873, 1893, 1920-21, and 1929- 31, were characterized by a drawing in of the circulating medium. In economical terms, this does not sound like such a terrible thing, but when it means that people do not have money to pay their rent or buy food, and when it means that an employer has to lay off three-fourths of his help because he cannot borrow the money to pay them, the enormous guilt of the bankers and the long record of suffering and misery for which they are responsible would suggest that no punishment might be too severe for their crimes against their fellowmen. On September 30, 1940, Governor Eccles said: \"If there were no debts in our money system, there would be no money.\" This is an accurate statement about our money system. Instead of money being created by the production of the people, the annual increase in goods and services, it is created by the bankers out of the debts of the people. Because it is inadequate, it is subject to great fluctuations and is basically unstab le. These fluctuations are also a source of great profit. For that reason, the Federal Reserve Board has consistently opposed any 162"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 264 legislation which attempts to stabilize the monetary system. Its position has been set forth definitively in Chairman Eccles’ letter to Senator Wagner on March 9, 1939, and the Memorandum issued by the Board on March 13, 1939. Chairman Eccles wrote that: \". . . you are advised that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System does not favor the enactment of Senate Bill No. 31, a bill to amend the Federal Reserve Act, or any other legislation of this general character.\" The Memorandum of the Board stated, in its \"Memorandum on Proposals to maintain pr ices at fixed levels\": \"The Board of Governors opposes any bill which proposes a stable price level, on the grounds that prices do not depend primarily on the price or cost of money; that th e Board’s control over money cannot be made complete; and that steady average prices, even if obtainable by official action, wo uld not insure lasting prosperity.\" Yet William McChesney Martin, the Chairman of the Board of Governors in 1952, said before the Subcommittee on De bt Control, the Patman Committee, on March 10, 1952 that \"One of the fundamental purposes of the Federal Reserve Ac t is to protect the value of the dollar.\" Senator Flanders questioned him: \"I s that specifically stated in the original legislation setting up the Federal Reserve System?\" \"No,\" replied Mr. Martin, \"but it is inherent in the entire legislative history and in the surrounding circumstances.\""},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 265 Senator Robert L. Owen has told us how it was taken out of the original legislation against his will, and that the Board of Governors has opposed such legislation. Apparently Mr. Martin does not know this. Steady average prices, indeed, are impossible so long as we have the speculators on the stock exchange driving prices up and down in order to reap profits for themselves. Despite Governor Eccles’ insistence that steady average prices would not insure lasting prosperity, they could do much to bring about this condition. A man on a yearly wage of $2,500 is not more prosperous if the price of bread increases five cents a loaf during the year. In 1935, Eccles said before the House Committee on Banking and Currency: \"The Government controls the gold re serve, that is, the power to issue money and credit, thus largely regulating the price structure.\" This is an almost direct contradict ion of Eccles’ statement in 1939 that prices do not depend, primarily, on the price or cost of money. In 1935, Governor Eccles stated before the House Committee: \"The Federal Reserve Board has the power of open market operations. Open-market operations are the most important single instrument of 163 control over the volume and cost of credit in this country. When I say \"credit\" in this connection, I mean money, because by far the largest part of money in use by the people of this country is in the form of bank credit or bank deposits.

Authority over these operations, which affect the welfare of the whole people, must be invested in a body representing the national interest.\" Governor Eccles testimony exposes the heart of the money machine which Paul Warburg revealed to his incredulous fellow bankers at Jekyll Island in 1910. Most Americans comment that they cannot understand how the Federal Reserve System operates. It remains beyond understanding, not because it is comple x, but because it is so simple. If a confidence man comes up to you and offers to demonstrate his marvelous money machine, you watch while he puts in a blank piece of paper, and cranks out a $100 bill. That is the Federal Reserve System. You then offer to buy this marvelous money machine, but you cannot. It is owned by the private stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks, whose identities can be traced part ially, but not completely, to \"the London Connection.\" At the House Banking and Currency Committee Hearings on June 6, 1960, Congressman Wright Patman, Chairman, questioned Carl E. Allen, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. (p. 4). PATMAN: \"Now Mr. Allen, when th e Federal Reserve Open Market Committee buys a million dollar bo nd you create the money on the credit of the Nation to pay for that bond, don’t you? ALLEN: That is correct. PATMAN: And the credit of the Nation is represented by Federal Reserve Notes in that case, isn’t it? If the banks want the actual money, you give Federal Rese rve notes in payment, don’t you? ALLEN: That could be done, but nobody wants the Federal Reserve"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 267 notes. PATMAN: Nobody wants them, because the banks would rather have the credit as reserves.\" This is the most incredible part of the Federal Reserve operation and one which is difficult for anyone to understand. How can any American citizen grasp the concept that there are people in this country who have the power to make an entry in a ledger that the government of the United States no w owes them one billion dollars, and to collect the principal and interest on this \"loan\"? Congressman Wright Patman tells us in \"The Primer of Money\", p. 38 of going into a Federal Reserve Bank and asking to see their bonds on which the American people are paying interest. After being shown the bonds, he asked to see their cash, but they only had some ledgers and blank checks. Patman says, \"The cash, in truth, does not exist and has never existed. What we call ‘cash reserves’ are simply bookkeeping credits entered upon ledgers 164 of the Federal Reserve Banks. The credits are created by the Federal Reserve Banks and then passed along through the banking system.\" Peter L. Bernstein, in A Primer On Money, Banking and Gold says: \"The trick in the Federal Reserve notes is that the Federal reserve banks lose no cash when they pay out this currency to the member banks. Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in anything except what the Government calls ‘legal tender ’--that is, money that a creditor must be willing to accept from a debtor in payment of sums owed him."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 26 8 But since all Federal Reserve notes are themselves declared by law to be legal money, they are really re deemable only in themselves . . . they are an irredeemable obligation issued by the Federal Reserve Banks.\"91 As Congressman Patman puts it, \"The dollar represents a one dollar debt to the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Banks create money out of thin air to buy Gover nment bonds from the United States Treasury, lending money into circulation at interest, by bookkeeping entries of checkbook credit to the Un ited States Treasury. The Treasury writes up an interest bearing bond for one billion dollars. The Federal Reserve gives the Treasury a one billion dollar credit for the bond, and has created out of nothing a one billion dollar debt which the American people are obligated to pay with interest.\" (Money Facts, House Banking and Currency Committee, 1964, p. 9) Patman continues, \"Where does the Federal Reserve system get the money with which to create Bank Reserves? Answer. It doesn’t get the money, it creates it. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money. The Federal Reserve is a total moneymaking machine. It can issue money or checks.\" In 1951, the Federa l Reserve Bank of New York published a pamphlet, \"A Day’s Work at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\" On page 22, we find that: \"There is still another and more important element of public interest in the operation of banks besides the safekeeping of money; banks can"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 26 9 ‘create’ money. One of the most important factors to remember in this connection is that the supply of money affects the general level of prices—the cost of living. The Cost of Living Index and money supply are parallel.\" The decisions of the Federal Reserve Board, or rather, the decisions which they are told to make by \"par ties unknown\", affect the daily lives of every American by the effect of these decisions on prices. Raising the interest rate, or causing money to became \"dearer\" acts to limit the amount of money available in the market, as does the raising of reserve __________________________ 91 Peter L. Bernstein, A Primer On Money, Banking and Gold, Vintage Books, New York, 1965, p. 104 165 requirements by the Federal Reserve System. Selling bonds by the Open Market Committee also extinguishes and lowers the money supply. Buying government securiti es on the open market \"creates\" more money, as does lowering th e interest rate and making money \"cheaper\". It is axiomatic that an increase in the money supply brings prosperity, and that a decrease in the money supply brings on a depression. Dramatic increases in the money which outstrip the supply of goods brings on inflation, \"too much money chasing too few goods\". A more esoteric aspect of the monetary system is \"velocity of circulation\", which sounds much more technical than it is. This is the speed at which money changes hands; if it is gold buried in the peasant’s garden, that is a slow velocity of circulation, caused by a"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 lack of confidence in the economy or the nation. Very rapid velocity of circulation, such as the stock market boom of the late 1920s, means quick turnover, spending and investment of money, and its stems from confidence, or overconfidence, in the economy. With a high velocity of circulation, a smaller money su pply circulates among as many people and goods as a larger mo ney supply would circulate with a slower velocity of circulation. We mention this because the velocity of circulation, or confidence in the economy, also is greatly affected by the Federal Reserve actions. Milton Friedman comments in Newsweek, May 2, 1983, \"The Federal Reserve’s major function is to determine the money supply. It has the power to increase or decrease the money supply at any rate it chooses.\" This is an enormous power, beca use increasing the money supply can cause the re-election of an admini stration, while decreasing it can cause an administration to be defeated. Friedman goes on to criticize the Federal Reserve, \"How is it that an institution which has so poor a record of performance nevertheless has so high a public reputation and even commands a considerable measure of credibility for its forecasts?\" All open market transactions, which affect the money supply, are conducted for a single System account by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the behalf of all the Federal Reserve Banks, and supervised by an officer of the Fe deral Reserve Bank of New York. The conferences at which decisions are made to buy or sell securities by the Open Market Committee remain closed to the public, and the deliberations also remain a mystery. On May 8, 1928, The New York Times reported that Adolph C. Miller, Governor of the Federal Reserve"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 Board, testifying before the House Banking and Currency Committee, stated that open market purchases and rediscount rates were established through \"conversations\". At that time, the purchases on the open market amounted to seventy or eighty million dollars a day, and would be ten times that today. These are vast sums to be manipulated on the basis of mere \"conversations\", but that is as much information as we can obtain. 166 Because of these mysterious transactions which affect the life, liberty and happiness of every American citizen, there have been numerous proposals such as Senate Document No. 23, presented by Mr. Logan on January 24, 1939, that \"The Gove rnment should create, issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of the consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of Government, but it is the Government’s greatest creative opportunity.\" On March 21, 1960, Congressman Wright Patman used a simple illustration in the Congressional Record of how banks \"create money\". \"If I deposit $100 with my bank and the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Bank are 20% then the bank can make a loan to John Doe of up to $80. Where do es the $80 come from? It does not come out of my deposit of $100; on the contrary, the bank simply credits John Doe’s account with $80. The bank can acquire Government obligations by the same procedure, by simply creating deposits to the credit of the government. Money creating is a power of"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 272 the commercial banks . . . Since 1917 the Federal Reserve has given the private banks forty-six billion dollars of reserves.\" How this is done is best revealed by Governor Eccles at Hearings before the House Committee on Ba nking and Currency on June 24, 1941: ECCLES: \"The banking system as a whole creates and extinguishes the deposits as they make loans and investments, whether they buy Government Bonds or whether they buy utility bonds or whether they make Farmer’s loans. MR. PATMAN: I am thoroughly in accord with what you say, Governor, but the fact remains that they created the money, did they not? ECCLES: Well, the banks create money when they make loans and investments.\" On September 30, 1941, before the same Committee, Governor Eccles was asked by Representative Patman: \"How did you get the money to buy those two billion dollars worth of Government securities in 1933? ECCLES: We created it. MR. PATMAN: Out of what? ECCLES: Out of the right to issue credit money. MR. PATMAN: And there is nothing behind it, is there, except our Government’s credit?"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 273 ECCLES: That is what our money system is. If there were no debts in our money system, there wouldn’t be any money.\" On June 17, 1942, Governor Eccles was interrogated by Mr. Dewey. ECCLES: \"I mean the Federal Reserve, when it carries out an open market operation, that is, if it purchases Government securities in the 167 open market, it puts new money into the hands of the banks which creates idle deposits. DEWEY: There are no excess reserves to use for this purpose? ECCLES: Whenever the Federal Reserve System buys Government securities in the open market, or buys them direct from the Treasury, either one, that is what it does. DEWEY: What are you going to use to buy them with? You are going to create credit? ECCLES: That is all we have ever done. That is the way the Federal Reserve System operates. The Federal Reserve System creates money. It is a bank of issue.\" At the House Hearing of 1947, Mr. Kolburn asked Mr. Eccles: \"What do you mean by monetization of the public debt? ECCLES: I mean the bank creating money by the purchase of Government securities. All is created by debt--either private or public debt."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 274 FLETCHER: Chairman Eccles, when do yo u think there is a possibility of returning to a free and open market, instead of this pegged and artificially controlled financial market we now have?

That they create the money they use to buy the securities? ANDERSON: That is correct. Banks are different from other lending institutions. When a savings association, an insurance company, or a credit union makes a loan, it lends the very dollar that its customers have previously paid in. But when a bank makes a loan, it simply adds to the borrower’s deposit account in the bank by the amount of the loan. The money is not taken from an yone. It is new money, recreated by the bank, for the use of the borrower.\" Strangely enough, there has never been a court trial on the legality or Constitutionality of the Federal Reserve Act. Although it is on much the same shaky grounds as the National Recovery Act, or NRA, which was challenged in Schechter Poultry v. United States of America, 29 U.S. 495, 55 US 837.842 (1935), the NRA was ruled unconstitu tional by the Supreme Court on the grounds that \"Congress may not abdicate or transfer to others its legitimate functions. Congress cannot Constitutionally delegate its legislative authority to trade or industrial associations or groups so as to empower them to make laws.\" Article 1, Sec. 8 of the Constitution provides th at \"The Congress shall have power to borrow money on the credit of the United States . . . and to coin Money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign Coin,"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures.\" According to the NRA deci- 168 sion, Congress cannot delegate this power to the Federal Reserve System, nor can it delegate its legislative authority to the Federal Reserve System to allow the System to fix the rate of bank reserves, the rediscount rate, or the volume of money. All of these are \"legislated\" by the Federal Reserve Board, meeting in legislative sessions to determine these matters and to issue \"laws\" or regulations fixing them. The Second World War gave the big bankers who owned the Federal Reserve System a chance to unload on the country billions of dollars printed early in 1930, in the biggest c ounterfeiting operat ion in history, all legalized by Roosevelt’s government, of course. Henry Hazlitt writes in the January 4, 1943 issue of Newsweek Magazine: \"The money that began to appear in circulation a week ago, December 21, 1942, was really printing press money in the fullest sense of the term, that is, money which has no collateral of any kind behind it. The Federal Reserve statement that ‘The Board of Governors, after consultation with the Treasury Department, has authorized Federal Reserve Banks to utilize at this time the existing stocks of currency printed in the early thirties, known as ‘Federal Reserve Banknotes’.

These countries are now drawing off these dollar balances in the form of gold. MR.

GOVERNOR ECCLES: I would like to discuss OPA, and leave the stabilization fund for a time when I am prepared to go into it. MR. SMITH: Just a minute.

In 1945, Henry Hazlitt, commenting in Newsweek of January 22, on Roosevelt’s annual budget message to Congress, quoted Roosevelt as saying: \"I shall later recommend legislation reducing the present high gold reserve requirements of theFederal Reserve Banks.\" 169 Hazlitt pointed out that the reserve requirement was not high, it was just what it had been for the past thirty years.

They have chosen to work from behind the scenes through carefully selected presidents of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other employees. The present chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is Paul Volcker. His appointment was greeted by one well-known economist with the following prediction, \"Volcker’s selection has been by far the worst. Carter has put Dracula in charge of the blood bank. To us, it means a crash and depression in the 80s is more certain than ever.\" Col. E.C. Harwood’s Research Report, August 6, 1979, gave much the same view. \"Paul Volcker is from the same mold as the unsound money men who have misguided the monetary actions of this nation for the past five decades. The outcome probably will be equally disastrous for the dollar and the U.S. economy.\" Despite these gloomy views, the report from The New York Times on the selection of Volcker was positively ecstatic. On July 26, 1979, The Times commented that Volcker learned \"the business\" from Robert Roosa, now partner of Brown Brothers Harri man, and that Volcker had been part of the Roosa Brain Trust at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 27 9 and, later, at the Treasury in the Kennedy administration. \"David Rockefeller, the chairman of Chase, and Mr. Roosa were strong influences in the Mr. Carter decision to name Mr. Volcker for the Reserve Board chairmanship.\" The New York Times did not point out that David Rockefeller and Robert Roosa had previously chosen Mr. Carter, a member of the Trilateral Commission, as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, or that Mr. Carter would hardly refuse to appoint their choice of Paul Volcker as the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Nor is it straining the point to be reminded that this manner of selection of the Chairman of the Board of Governors is directly in the line of royal prerogative going back to George Peabody’s initial agreement wi th N.M. Rothschild, to the Jekyll Island meeting, and to the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act. 171 The Times noted that \"Volcker’s choice was approved by European banks in Bonn, Frankfurt and Zurich.\" William Simon, former Secretary of Treasury, was quoted as saying \"a marvelous choice.\" The Times further noted that the Dow market rose on Volcker’s nomination, registering the best gains in three weeks for a rise of 9.73 points, and that the dollar rose sharply on foreign exchange@ at home and abroad. Who was Volcker, that his appointment could have such an effect on the stock market and the value of the dollar in foreign exchange? He represented the most powerful house of \"the London Connection,\" Brown Brothers Harriman, and the Lo ndon houses which directed the Rockefeller empire. On July 29, 1979, The Times had said of Volcker, \"New Man Will Chart His Own Course\"."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 280 Volcker’s background shows that this was nonsense. His course has always been charted for him by his masters in London. He attended Princeton, obtained an M.A. at Harvard, and went to the London School of Economics 1951-52, the bank er’s graduate school. He then came to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an economist from 1952-57, economist at Chase Manhatta n Bank, 1957-61, with Treasury Department 1961-65, as deputy under secretary for monetary affairs, 1963-65, and under secretary for mone tary affairs, 1969-74. He then became President of the Federal Re serve Bank of New York from 1975- 79, when Carter, at the behest of Robert Roosa and David Rockefeller, appointed him Chairman of the Fede ral Reserve Board of Governors. He was succeeded as President of Federal Reserve Bank of New York by Anthony Solomon, a Harvard Ph .D. who was with the OPA 1941-42 and with the government financ ial mission to Iran 1942-46. He operated a canned food compan y in Mexico from 1951-61, was president of International Investme nt Corp. for Yugoslavia 1969-72 (a communist country), under secretary for monetary affairs at Treasury 1977-80. In short, Solomon’s backgr ound was much the same as Paul Volcker’s. The New York Times stated on December 2, 1981, \"For years the Federal Reserve was the second or third most secret institution in town. The Sunshine Act of 1976 penetrated the curtain a trifle. The board now holds a public meeting once a we ek on Wednesday at 10 a.m., but not to discuss Monetary policy, which is still regarded as top secret and not to be discussed in public.\" The Times mentioned that when Open Market Committee meetings are held, Solomon and Volcker sit together at the head of the table and relay the instructions which they have received from abroad."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 281 Behind Volcker and Solomon stands Robert Roosa, Secretary of the Treasury in Carter’s shadow cabinet, and representing Brown Brothers Harriman, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, and the Royal Economic Institute.

Dr. Martin Larson points out that \"The international consortium of financiers known as the Bilderbergers, who meet annually in profound secrecy to determine the destiny of the western world, is a creature of the Rockefel ler-Rothschild alliance, and that it held its third meeting on St. Simons Island, only a short distance from Jekyll Island.\" Larson also states th at \"The Rockefeller interests work in close alliance with the Rothschilds and other central banks.\"** On June 18, 1983, President Ro nald Reagan ended months of speculation by announcing that he was reappointing Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Boar d of Governors for another four year term, although Volcker’s term was not up until August 6, 1983.

After attending the London School of Economics, and finding out who issues the orders of the international financial community, Volcker has ever since played the game. Not once has he failed to carry out the orders of the \"London Connection\".

The direct line which leads from the participants in the Jekyll Island Conference of 1910 to the present day is illustrated by a passage from \"A Primer on Money\", Committee on Banking and Currency, U.S. House of Representatives, 88th Congress, 2d session, August 5, 1964, p. 75: \"The practical effect of requiring all purchases to be made through the open market is to take money from the taxpayer and give it to the dealers. It forces the Government to pay a toll for borrowing money. There are six ‘bank’ dealers: First National City Bank of New York; Chemical Crop.

There is ample evidence demonstrating the present preeminence of the same banks which set up the Federal Reserve System in 1914. For in stance, Warren Brookes writes on the editorial page of The Washington Post, June 6, 1983: \"Citicorp (National City Bank and First National Bank of New York, merged in 1955) just recorded an 18 .6% return on equity, J.P.

These banks also profit steadily from the otherwise inexplicable fluctuations in monetary growth and interest rates. Brookes further comments on \"actual monetary growth rates alternately gyrating from 0 to 17% in successive six month pe riods for three recession-wracked years. The two measures of money growth most admired by Milton Friedman M2 and M3, 174 have actually shown little change on a year to year basis in the 1972- 82 period.\" Thus we have money growth rates gyrating from 0 to 17% but no actual year to year changes, which raises the question of why we cannot have stability of monetary growth throughout the year. The answer is that the big profits are ma de by these gyrations, and the next"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 285 question is, who sets in motion these gyrations? The answer is \"the London Connection\". To draw attention from the continued control of the bankers and their heirs, who obtained the government monopoly of the nation’s money and credit in 1913, the paid propagandists of the controlled media monopoly and academia are constant ly trotting forth new and more exotic theories of economics. Thus James Burnham, one of the National Review propagandists, won fame with a ridiculous theory of \"the managers\". He postulated that the old arbiters of wealth, the J.P. Morgans, the Warburgs and the Roth schilds had, by 1950, disappeared from the scene, being replaced by a new class of \"managers\". This theory, which had no foundation in fact, served to obscure the fact that the same people still controlled the monetary system of the world. The \"managers\" were just that, exec utives like Volcker who were front men, paid employees who would continue to receive their paychecks only as long as they carried out their employers’ instructions. Burnham remains a well-paid propagandist at the National Review, which many prominent leaders, including President Reagan, believe to be a \"conservative\" publication. From 1914 to 1982, a period in wh ich many thousands of American banks went bankrupt, the original pu rchasers of Federal Reserve Bank stock have not only survived but th ey have consolidated their power. And what of \"the London Connection\"? Does it still exist, and is it still dictating the economic destiny of the United States? The Washington Post, May 19, 1983, carried a story datelined Nairobi, Keny a, noting the meeting of the African Development Bank. \"The British merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell and a syndicate of the United States, Kuhn Loeb,"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 28 6 Lehman Brothers International, the Fr ench Lazard Freres and Britain’s Warburg are discreetly acting as fi nancial advisors to about ten debt- plagued African states.\" There are the same names we encoun tered in 1914, still managing the finances of the world, with profits for themselves but with disastrous results for everyone else. Perhaps we can look for relief to the present Administration of President Reagan. Unfortunately, before reaching him we have to run the gamut of the long list of his principal staff, composed of men from J. Henry Schroder, Brown Brothers Harriman, and other leading components of \"The London Connection\". Lopez Portillo, President of Mexico, in addressing the Mexican National Congress of Mexico in September, 1982, called the world credit boom of the past decade a financial pe stilence akin to the Black Death which swept 175 Europe in the fourteenth century. \"A s in mediaeval times, it flattens country after country. It is transmitted by rats and it yields unemployment and misery, industrial bankruptcy and enrichment by speculation. The remedy prescribed by faith healers is forced inactivity and depriving the patient of food.\" Forbes Magazine stated October 11, 1982, \"The world gasps for liquidity, not because the suppl y of money has contracted but because too much of it now goes to pay off old debts rather than fund new productive investments.\" The policy of high interest rates and tight money has been disastrous for the United States.

Small farmers are absent. Small business is barely visible. No women appear on the district boards and only six among the branches.

Surely not banking or big business, if we are to judge from the massive interlocks revealed by this analysis of the district boards. The big business and banking dominance of the Federal Reserve System cited in this report can be traced, in part, to the original Federal Reserve Act, which gave member commercial banks the right to select two-thirds of the directors of each district bank.

[See Chart I] 180 APPENDIX I E.C. Knuth, in The Empire of the City, priv. printed, 1946, p. 27, refers to \"the Bank of England, the full partner of the American Administration in the conduct of the financial affairs of all the world\" and cites the Encyclopaedia Americana, 1943 edition. Barron cites Lord Swaythling, (April 8, 1923), \"Lord Swaythling said, ‘Exchange can only be run from London. This is the center in Exchange.’\" ( They Told Barron, by Clarence W. Barron, founder of Baron’s Weekly, Harpers, New York, 1930, p. 27.) Exchange, in the international financial world, means the transactions in money or securities, or simply, the \"exchange\" of the values of these securities. It is necessary that this \"exchange\" take place where the values can be established, and this place is the \"City\" in London. London was established as the primary center of exchange because of the \"Consols\" of the Bank of England, bonds which could never be"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 294 redeemed, but which paid a stable rate of return. Henry Clews writes, in The Wall Street View, Silver Burdett Co. 19 00, p. 255, \"The Consolidated Act of 1757 consolidated the debts of the nation of England at 3%, which were kept in an account at the Bank of England and is the great bulwark of its deposits.\" By ostentatiously \"dumping\" \"Consols\" on the London Exchange after the Battle of Waterloo, in a pretended panic, Nathan Meyer Roth schild then secretly bought up the Consols sold in the panic by other holders at a low rate, and became the largest holder of Cons ols, and thus won control of the Bank of England in 1815. 12% Dividends Although a Labor government nationalized the Bank of England in 1946, The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia points out (vol. I, p. 490c) that the Bank of England continues to pay 12% dividends per annum, just as it had done prior to the nationalizat ion. The \"Governor\" is appointed by the government, in a situation similar to that in the United States, where the Governors of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President. However, as is pointed out in the Encyclopaedia Americana v. 13, p. 272, \"In practice, the governors of the Bank of England have not hesitated to criticize and brin g pressure on the government in public.\" Bank Rate The interest rate set by the Bank of England is known as \"the Bank rate\", and it is a controlling factor in interest rates throughout the world, 181"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" 295 although rates in other countries may be higher or lower than this \"Bank rate\". The Bank of England manages the government debt, and is called upon to arbitrate in political affairs. It served as the intermediary with the Iran revolutionaries in negotiating for the return of the American hostages--a recent example. We should not be surprised that the present Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Gordon Richardson is a prominent international financial figure, who appears elsewhere in these pages because of his connection with the J. Henry Schroder @Wagg in London from 1962 to 1972, when he became Governor of th e Bank of England. He was also director of J. Henry Schroder Co., New York, and Schroder Banking Corp., New York. He also serves as director of Rolls Royce and Lloyd’s Bank. Although he resides in London, he maintains a home in New York, and is listed in the current Manhattan directory simply as \"G. Richardson, 45 Sutton Place S.\", although a prior listing showed him at 4 Sutton Place. Sutton Place was developed as a fashionable address for the international set by Bessie Marbury, whom we earlier cited for her connection with the Morgan family and the Roosevelts. The present directors of the Bank of England (1982) include Leopold de Rothschild of N.M. Rothschild & Sons, Sir Robert Clark, chairman of Hill Samuel Bank, the most influential bank after Rothschilds, John Clay, of Hambros Bank, and David Scholey, of Warburg Bank, and joint chairman of S.C. Warburg Co.

U.S. banks like Citibank (New York City), on whose board of directors sits the powerful British financier, Lord Aldington, collaborate openly in this market.

A short time ago, __________________________ * Harpers Magazine, Feb. 1980 183 the present writer learned a new name, The Tavistock Institute of London, also known as the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. \"Human relations\" covers every aspect of human behavior, and it is the modest goal of the Tavistock Institute to obtain and exercise control over every aspect of human be havior of American citizens. Because of the intensive artillery barrages of World War I, many soldiers were permanently impaired by shell shock. In 1921, the Marquees of Tavistock, 11th Duke of Bedford, gave a building to a group which planned to conduct rehabilitation programs for shell shocked British soldiers. The group took the name of \"Tavistock Institute\" after its benefactor.

The Tavistock Institute was taken over by Sir John Rawlings Reese, head of the British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau. A cadre of highly trained specialists in psychological warfare was built up in total secrecy. In fifty years, the name \"Tavistock Institute’ appears only twice in the Index of the New York Times, yet this group, according to LaRouche and other authorities, organized and trained the entire staffs of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the Strategic Bombing Survey, Supreme Headquarters of the Allie d Expeditionary Forces, and other key American military groups during World War II. During World War II, the Tavistock Institute combined with the medical sciences division of the Rockefeller Foundation for esoter ic experiments with mind-altering drugs. The present drug culture of th e United States is traced in its entirety to this Institute, which supervised the Central Intelligence Agency’s training programs. The \"LSD counter culture\" originated when Sandoz A.G., a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg & Co., developed a new drug from lysergic acid, called LSD. James Paul Warburg (son of Paul Warburg who had written the Federal Reserve Act in 1910), financed a subsidiary of the Tavistock Institute in the United States called the Institute for Policy Studies, whose director, Marcus Raskin, was appointed to the National Security Council. James Paul Warburg set up a CIA program to experiment with LSD on CIA agents, some of whom later committed suicide. This pr ogram, MK-Ultra, supervised by Dr. Gottlieb, resulted in huge lawsuits against the United States Government by the families of the victims.

The English Tavistock Institute has not restricted its activities to left-wing groups, but has also directed the programs of such supposedly \"conservative\" American think tanks as the Herbert Hoov er Institute at Stanford University, Heritage Foundation, Wharton, Hudson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Rand. The \"sensitivity train- 184 ing\" and \"sexual encounter\" programs of the most radical California groups such as Esalen Institute and its many imitators were all developed and implemented by Tavistock Institute psychologists. One of the rare items concerning the Tavistock Institute appears in Business Week, Oct. 26, 1963, with a photograph of its building in the most expensive medical offices area of London. The story mentions \"the Freudian bias\" of the Institut e, and comments that it is amply financed by British blue-chip corporations, including Unilever, British Petroleum, and Baldwin Steel. According to Business Week, the psychological testing programs and group relations training programs of the Institute were implemented in the United States by the University of Michigan and the University of California, which are hotbeds of radicalism and the drug network. It was the Marquees of Tavistock, 12th Duke of Bedford, whom Rudolf Hess flew to England to contact about ending World War II. Tavistock was said to be worth $40 million in 1942.

Mitchell, in turn, became the patron of Arthur Burns and Milton Friedman, whose theories are now the power techniques of Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Board. Greenspan is also the protégé of Ayn Rand, a weirdo who interposed her sexual affairs with guttural commands to be selfish. Rand was also the patron of CIA propagandist William Buckeley and the National Review. Greenspan was director of major Wall Street firms such as J.P. Morgan Co., Morgan Guaranty Trust (the American bank for the Soviets after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917), Broo kings Institution, Bowery Savings Bank, the Dreyfus Fund, General Foods, and Time, Inc. Greenspan’s most impressive achievement was as chai rman of the National Commission on Social Security from 1981-1983. He juggled figures to convince the public that Social Security was bankrupt, when in fact it had an enormous surplus. These figures we re then used to fasten onto American workers a huge increase in Social Security withholding tax, which invoked David Ricardo’s economic dictum of the iron law of wages, that workers could only be paid a subsistence wage, and any funds beyond that must be extorted from them forcibly by tax increases. As a partner of J.P. Morgan Co. since 1977, Greenspan represented the unbroken line of cont rol of the Federal Reserve System by the firms represented at the secret meeting on Jekyll Island in 1910, where Henry P. Davison, righthand man of J.P. Morgan, was a key figure in the drafting of the Federal Reserve Act. Within days of taking over as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Greenspan immediately raised the interest rate on Sept. 4, 1987, the first such increase in three years of general prosperity, and precipitated the"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" 304 stock market crash of Oct., 1987, Black Monday, when the Dow Jones average plunged 508 points.

The most frequently asked questions and the answers are as follows: Q: What is the Federal Reserve System? A: The Federal Reserve System is not Federal; it has no reserves; and it is not a system, but rather, a criminal syndicate. It is the product of criminal syndicalist activity of an international consortium of dynastic families comprising what the author terms \"The World Order\" (see \"THE WORLD ORDER\" and \"THE CURSE OF CANAAN\", both by Eustace Mullins). The Federal Reserve system is a central bank operating in the United States. Although the student wi ll find no such definition of a central bank in the textbooks of an y university, the author has defined a central bank as follows: It is the dominant financial power of the country which harbors it. It is entirely private-owned, although it seeks to give the appearance of a governme ntal institution. It has the right to print and issue money, the traditio nal prerogative of monarchs. It is set up to provide financing for wars . It functions as a money monopoly having total power over all the money and credit of the people. Q: When Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913, did the Congressmen know that they were creating a central bank? A: The members of the 63rd Congress had no knowledge of a central bank or of its monopolistic operations. Many of those who voted for"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":" 322 the bill were duped; others were br ibed; others were intimidated. The preface to the Federal Reserve Act reads \"An Act to provide for the establishment of Federal reserve bank s, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial papers, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes.\" The unspecified \"other purposes\" were to give international conspirators a monopoly of all the money and credit of the people of the United States; to finance World War I through this new central bank, to place Americ an workers at the mercy of the Federal Reserve system’s collection agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and to allow the monopoli sts to seize the assets of their competitors and put them out of business. Q: Is the Federal Reserve system a government agency? A: Even the present chairman of the House Banking Committee claims that the Federal Reserve is a government agency, and that it is not privately owned. The fact is that the government has never owned a single share of Federal Reserve Bank stock. This charade stems from the fact that the President of the United States appoints the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, who are then confirmed by the Senate. The secret author of the Act, banker Paul Warburg, a representative of the Rothschild bank, coined the name \"Federal\" from thin air for the Act, which he wrote to achieve two of his pet aspirations, an \"elastic currency\", read (rubber check), and to facilitate trading in acceptances, international trade credits. Warburg was founder and president of the International Acceptance Corporation, and made billions in profits by trading in this commercial paper. Sec. 7 of the Federal Reserve Act provides \"Federal reserve banks, including the"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":" 323 capital and surplus therein, and income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal, state and loca l taxation, except taxes on real estate.\" Government buildings do not pay real estate tax. Q: Are our dollar bills, which carry the label \"Federal Reserve notes\" government money? A: Federal Reserve notes are actually promissory notes, promises to pay, rather than what we traditionally consider money. They are interest bearing notes issued agai nst interest bearing government bonds, paper issued with nothing but paper backing, which is known as fiat money, because it has only the fiat of the issuer to guarantee these notes. The Federal Reserve Act authorizes the issuance of these notes \"for the purposes of making advances to Federal reserve banks... The said notes shall be obligations of the United States. They shall be redeemed in gold on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States in the District of Columbia.\" Tourists visiting the Bureau of Printing and Engraving on the Mall in Washington, D.C. view the printing of Federal Reserve notes at this governmental agency on contract from the Federal Reserve System for the nominal sum of .00260 each in units of 1,000, at the same price re gardless of the denomination. These notes, printed for a private bank, then become liabilities and obligations of the United States government and are added to our present $4 trillion de bt. The government had no debt when the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913. Q: Who owns the stock of the Federal Reserve Banks? A: The dynastic families of the ruling World Order, inte rnationalists who are loyal to no race, religion, or nation. They are families such as the"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":" 324 Rothschilds, the Warburgs, the Schi ffs, the Rockefellers, the Harrimans, the Morgans and others known as the elite, or \"the big rich\". Q: Can I buy this stock? A: No. The Federal Reserve Act stipulates that the stock of the Federal Reserve Banks cannot be bought or sold on any stock exchange. It is passed on by inheritance as the fortun e of the \"big rich\". Almost half of the owners of Federal Reserve Bank stock are not Americans. Q: Is the Internal Revenue Service a governmental agency? A: Although listed as part of the Treasury Department, the IRS is actually a private collection agency for the Federal Reserve System. It originated as the Black Hand in mediae val Italy, collectors of debt by force and extortion for the ruling Italian mob families. All personal income taxes collected by the IRS are required by law to be deposited in the nearest Federal Reserve Bank, under Sec. 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, \"The moneys held in the general fund of the Treasury may be ....deposited in Federal reserve banks, which banks, when required by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall act as fiscal agents of the United States.\" Q: Does the Federal Reserve Board control the daily price and quantity of money? A: The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, meeting in private as the Federal Open Market Committee with presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, controls all economic activity throughout the United States by issuing orders to buy government bonds on the open market, creating money out of nothing and causing inflationary pressure, or, conversely, by selling government bonds on the open market and"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" 325 extinguishing debt, creating deflationary pressure and causing the stock market to drop. Q: Can Congress abolish th e Federal Reserve System? A: The last provision of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, Sec. 30, states, \"The right to amend, alter or repeal this Act is expressly reserved.\" This language means that Congress can at any time move to abolish the Federal Reserve System, or buy back the stock and make it part of the Treasury Department, or to altar the System as it sees fit. It has never done so. Q: Are there many critics of the Federal Reserve beside yourself? A: When I began my researches in 1948, the Fed was only thirty-four years old. It was never mentioned in the press. Today the Fed is discussed openly in the news section and the financial pages. There are bills in congress to have th e Fed audited by the Government Accounting Office. Because of my ex pose, it is no longer a sacred cow, although the Big Three candidat es for President in 1992, Bush, Clinton and Perot, joined in a unanimous chorus during the debates that they were pledged not to touch the Fed. Q: Have you suffered any personal consequences because of your expose of the Fed? A: I was fired from the staff of the Library of Congress after I published this expose in 1952, the only person ever discharged from the staff for political reasons. When I sued, the court refused to hear the case. The entire German edition of this book was burned in 1955, the only book burned in Europe since the Second World War. I have endured continuous harassment by government agencies, as detailed in my"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":" 32 6 books \"A WRIT FOR MARTYRS\" and \"MY LIFE IN CHRIST\". My family also suffered harassment. When I spoke recently in Wembley Arena in London, the press denounced me as \"a sinister lunatic\". Q: Does the press always support the Fed? A: There have been some encouragin g defections in recent months. A front page story in the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 8, 1993, stated, \"The current Fed structure is difficult to justify in a democracy. It’s an oddly undemocratic institution. Its organization is so dated that there is only one Reserve bank west of the Rockies, and two in Missouri...Having a central bank with a monopoly over the issuance of the currency in a democratic society is a very difficult balancing act.\" Congressman McFadden on the Federal Reserve Corporation "}]
