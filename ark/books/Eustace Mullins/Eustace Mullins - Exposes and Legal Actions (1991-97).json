Some Illuminating Background On The Character “John Coleman\" (07or08/92) ************************************************  01.) Terrorist Adl Sued By Daring Patriot Eustace Mullins 12/23/93 ALL MEDIA PRESS RELEASE By Eustace Mullins Dec. 7, 1993 has become an historic date with the filing of a $100 million lawsuit against the most feared group in the United States, the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith. Writer Eustace Mullins, 70, of 126 Madison Place, Staunton, VA 24401, author of such best sellers as: Murder by Injection , expos é of the Drug Trust; Secrets of the Federal Reserve , expos é of the Money Trust; The World Order , expos é of the Secret Government; The Curse of Canaan , expos é of secret conspiracies; and The Rape of Justice , expos é of the legal monopoly, defends himself against almost 50 years of persecution by the ADL as retaliation for his expos é s. The last living protege of poet Ezra Pound, a native American curmudgeon who commissioned Mullins to write the history of the Federal Reserve System in 1948, caught the attention of the FBI and the ADL when this work appeared in 1953. They have harassed him ever since. In 1959, Mullins wrote the only authorized biography of Pound, This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound , published by Fleet publishers in New York. After serving on the staff of the Library of Congress, Mullins became a financial consultant to the American Petroleum Institute in Rockefeller Center. He later became a public relations executive for the Chicago Motor Club. He has been a fulltime writer, lecturer, radio and television personality since 1958. He lectures throughout the United States, and is a guest on many talk shows. Mullins charges the ADL with inciting racial hatred and hate crimes under RICO statutes and statutes outlawing criminal syndicalism. He says the ADL has consistently denied his freedom of speech and civil rights. The suit has been filed with the United States District Court in the District of Columbia. Mullins looks to the court for a landmark decision on professional hatemongering and the commercial purveying of racial strife. COMPLAINT Parties 1.) Plaintiff, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as Pro Propria Personae, is a citizen"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in good standing of the State of Virginia, of the United States of America, residing at 126 Madison Place, Staunton, Virginia, 24401. 2 .) Defendant, the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, an international intelligence organization and espionage group for the State of Israel, acting as the central intelligence agency for more than three hundred Zionist lobbying groups tax exempted by the govemment of the United States to illegally represent the State of Israel as unregistered foreign agents, in open violation of the statutes of the United States. Address is 1100 Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington, District of Columbia, 20036. Jurisdiction 3.) This court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to USC 18-241, 18-1961, 1963, 1965 (a) (b) (c) (d); 18-241; USC 28-1331,1332,1343; USC 28-534; USC 42-1981, 1983,1985, Constitution of the United States, First and Sixth Amendments. 4.) Plaintiff respectfully alleges that said defendant has for almost a half century carried out a steady campaign of harassment, intimidation and terrorism against plaintiff, and against members of plaintiffs family. In April of 1953, defendant attacked plaintiff in its publications because he was a protege of poet Ezra Pound, calling plaintiff “the lowest of the gutter anti-Semites\" and other epithets. Defendant then launched a series of nation-wide press attacks against plaintiff. 5.) Defendant knowingly and willfully lied in attacking plaintiff as an “anti-Semite”, because defendant’s surveillance of plaintiff had apprised them that plaintiff was working closely with many righteous Jewish American intellectual leaders, such world renowned figures as Benjamin Freedman, Henry Klein, Myron Fagan, Dr. Emanuel Josephson, and others. The righteous Jews participated in and approved of plaintiff's work, knowing he was not anti-Semitic as defendant falsely claims. 6.) When plaintiff refused to abandon his campaign of exposing defendant’s subversion of the government of the United States, defendant ordered plaintiff to be discharged from his position on the staff of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. in 1952. Sen. Herbert Lehman, D-N.Y., of the international bankers’ Lehman Bros., and national chairman for the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B'Rith, wrote a letter to Librarian of Congress Luther Evans, ordering him to discharge plaintiff from the staff, later sending two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to the Library of Congress to make certain that Evans cornplied. Today, plaintiff is still the only member of the staff of the Library of Congress ever discharged for purely political reasons. As his reward, Evans was promoted to a sinecure at UNESCO in Paris, where he was given unlimited supplies of Rothschild brandy. He died a hopeless alcoholic. 7.) Under Ezra Pound’s guidance, plaintiff wrote the only history of the Federal Reserve System, an abstruse work on banking which defendant promptly denounced as \"anti- Semitic\" when it appeared in 1953. Defendant then prevented any review, mention or bookstore sale of this book, which continues to the present day. Defendant also has"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"prevented plaintiff from obtaining lucrative speaking engagements, national radio and television interviews and other means of reaching a national audience with his exposés. In contrast, defendant routinely arranges for payments of $25,000 to $100,000 to leaders who obey defendant’s political orders for routine non-informative speeches. 8.) Seeking employment, plaintiff went to New York in 1953 and was hired as consultant on toll road finance by the American Petroleum Institute in Rockefeller Center. After one year at American Petroleum Institute, defendant sent agents to their offices and demanded that plaintiff be discharged. The Institute complied, although plaintiff was a valued employee who had been repeatedly promoted. 9.) Plaintiff then went to Chicago and was hired by the Chicago Motor Club, largest member of the American Automobile Association, as public relations consultant. After two successful years in this position, defendant had two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents sent to his office to demand that he be discharged. They denounced him as ‘a dangerous radical’ and employer reluctantly discharged him. 10.) Because defendant has for almost a half century conspired to have plaintiff discharged from remunerative executive positions, plaintiff became extremely impoverished and was unable to marry and have children. Defendant thus committed the crime of genocide against plaintiff. Art II Genocide Act, \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group .. causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, imposing measures intended to prevent births with the group.\" 11.) Despite his lack of income, defendant had the Internal Revenue Service repeatedly charge plaintiff with tax deficiencies. Defendant regularly sends the IRS hit lists of Americans whom it wishes to destroy; plaintiff was Number One on this list. The Internal Revenue Service, which annually raises ninety per cent of the national budget of the State of Israel, and which is known to Washington insiders as (the Israeli Revenue Service), repeatedly launched lengthy investigations of plaintiff, demanding astronomical sums at times when plaintiff was not gainfully employed. Each time, plaintiff, at great expense, fought back, and the IRS admitted that plaintiff had no tax deficiency. On Jan. 4, 1983, Judge Theodore Tannenwald Jr. of U.S. Tax Court, issued a letter from the bench that plaintiff had no tax deficiency. (See A Writ For Martyrs, by Eustace Mullins, p. 211, O.T.U. Christ Church 1985.) 12.) Because plaintiff fearlessly continued his work of exposing defendant’s international terrorism, defendant now launched vicious attacks against the closest members of plaintiff's family. Agents of defendant posing as Army agents attacked Eustace Clarence Mullins Sr., plaintiff’s father, in 1957, beating him savagely when he refused to give information against plaintiff. He suffered a major heart attack from this beating, later dying from its effects. 13.) When plaintiff continued his work of exposing defendant’s subversion, defendant turned the attack against plaintiff's mother, an elderly invalid. After enduring months of daily telephone threats and visits by defendant’s agents, plaintiff’s mother, Jane Catherine"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Muse Mullins, died of a heart attack in 1971. 14.) Plaintiff now assumed the task of caring for his handicapped sister, who had been crippled by a member of defendant’s organization, a notorious dope addict who crushed her beneath the wheels of his Pierce Arrow limousine. While plaintiff was out working as an insurance investigator, defendant began to send agents to his home, threatening his crippled sister, and informing her that plaintiff was in jail and would never return. After months of this campaign, Dorothy Louise Mullins also died, of a heart attack, in 1979. Plaintiff has been alone in the world since the murders of his family. 15.) Defendant continued to keep plaintiff at the top of its hit list for fear that plaintiff might investigate and report on its role in the assassination of Martin Luther King. Plaintiff had been one of the principal victims of the ADL-inspired notorious FBI program COINTELPRO, which was directed primarily at black leaders. Defendant decided that Martin Luther King, the leader of America’s blacks, was \"getting too uppity” according to an ADL official, a ‘schwarzer, a Yiddish term of contempt for blacks, and who was assassinated to be replaced by the more docile Rev. Abernathy. 16.) Defendant continued to harass plaintiff for fear that plaintiff, who had been invited to write an exposé of the John F. Kennedy assassination, would reveal that defendant was the missing link in the assassination plot. Plaintiff found that defendant was the only group which was in constant communication with the CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, and Jack Rubenstein prior to the assassination. Columnist Dorothy Kilgallen interviewed Rubenstein and leamed of defendant’s involvement, When she boasted she was going to break the assassination plot wide open, she died suddenly of an \"overdose”, and all other notes disappeared from her apartment. 17.) Defendant also continues to harass plaintiff for fear that he will write on its involvement with the Waco Holocaust Massacre in which eighty-four Christian worshippers were burned alive, including twenty-three small children, who had been herded into a basement, doused with inflammables, and set afire by government agents operating under instructions from defendant through the Cult Awareness Network and other defendant groups. The FBI and BATF agents had been ordered to commit this atrocity, the worst massacre in U.S. history, as a re-enactment of the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 by Rockefeller assassins. Forty-five workers were burned alive, including thirty-two women and children. The Waco Holocaust was also a re-enactment of defendants’ favorite movie, The Dirty Dozen , in which German army officers and their wives at a recreation center are herded into a basement by special forces, doused with gasoline and set afire. Human torches are a part of defendants’ occult cabalistic rituals. 18.) Plaintiff has made a number of trips to Jackson, Wyoming to establish a Christian university there. At 3:30 a.m. on Friday the 13th, 1990, agents started a fire directly below plaintiff’s room at the Anvil Motel. Plaintiff was the only occupant in that wing of the motel. He barely escaped with his life as the motel burned to the ground. No investigation of this arson and attempted murder was ever made. (Exhibit A)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"19.) Plaintiff was invited to speak at Freedom Forum at the Greek Orthodox Church, Centerville, Ma. on June 21,1991. Defendant prepared a hate attack on plaintiff printed in the Cape Cod Times June 10, 1991, falsely charging that plaintiff was \"anti-Semitic” although no instance of plaintiff ever participating in an anti-Semitic incident was mentioned. Throughout the article, the reporter cited the source as \"according to the Anti- Defamation League”. Despite this attack, (Exhibit B) the church refused to cancel the meeting. Agents then threatened to blow up the church if plaintiff appeared. The meeting was then cancelled. Although this was the most notorious hate crime of 1991, no investigation was made by the local, state and federal agencies to whom it was reported. Defendant clearly violated plaintiff's right to freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution . 20.) Plaintiff was an invited speaker to the Nightlink Communications Conference in London at Wembley Arena, January 9 and 10, 1993. Defendant attempted to have the British Govemment bar plaintiff from leaving the airport for the meeting, but the govemment found no basis for such action. Defendant then launched a frenetic campaign against plaintiff in the British press, although plaintiff had never before appeared in Britain. Because of this hate barrage, the press termed plaintiff “a sinister lunatic”. The unfavorable publicity generated by defendant resulted in low attendance and a disaster for the sponsors. 21.) Defendant’s sinister hand can be seen behind many of the most widely reported events in the press. The Washington Post revealed Nov. 18, 1993 that ‘the Anti-Defamation League was at the forefront of the campaign to prosecute Demjanjuk\" (an American citizen falsely accused of killing Jews). The New York Times published lengthy interviews with an FBI agent provocateur who at behest of defendant set up the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, in order to arouse American anger against all Arab peoples. This is a typical ADL operation. 22.) It is necessary to introduce some background information on defendant before plaintiff is dismissed as a hopeless paranoid inflicting his nightmares on the judicial system. In fact, no statement in any of plaintiff’s many books has been challenged or disproven in more than forty years. Plaintiff has the charters of incorporation of both the B'Nai B'Rith Foundation and the Anti-Defamation League. They were founded by Henry Monsky and Philip Morris Klutznick, professional Jewish activists who amassed large fortunes by manipulating Jewish organizations. Monsky, who married Daisy Rothschild, was a delegate to the United Nations Charter San Francisco meeting in 1945, head of the Office of Civil Defense, who died in 1947 while attending a meeting of the American Jewish Conference, of which he was president. He was also chairman of United Jewish Appeal and president of the Supreme Masonic Lodge of B'Nai B'Rith. Philip Morris Klutznick joined the Department of Justice in 1935 to set up the special Zionist secret cell ‘nesher” which later took over the entire department. A partner of investment bankers Salomon Bros., he was president of the World Jewish Congress and national president of B'Nai B'Rith. After serving as director of the National Federal Public Housing Project, he amassed a fortune in real estate. These groups are featured in a definitive work by researcher Laird Wilcox, HATE GROUPS IN AMERICA, a Record of Bigotry and Violence, the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith , 1984."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"23.) Defendant’s criminal activities have been headlines for many months, when officials discovered that the ADL had paid police officials for many thousands of documents stolen from police files to augment ADL files in San Francisco. Tom Gerard of the CIA and a skilled double agent, Roy Bullock, had looted police files for the ADL. 24.) The last survivor of the J. Edgar Hoover stalwarts at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Buck Revell, boasted at a Houston Hate Crimes Conference, (sponsored by the ADL), Oct. 16, 1993 that it has long been FBI policy to encourage the ADL to spy on Americans both as individuals and as organizations. Defendants’ longtime subversion of the FBI (ostensibly a national crime fighting force) came about through defendant’s close Mafia connections. The Mafia gave J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, a free suite each winter at the Mafia winter headquarters in Miami, the Roney Plaza Hotel. Hidden cameras then photographed Hoover and his longtime consort, Clyde Tolson, in indelicate positions. The film was turned over to Mafia boss Meyer Lansky, one of defendant’s biggest contributors. Lansky and defendant now blackmailed Hoover into doing anything they demanded. Defendant also subverted the entire Department of Justice, using it to prosecute chosen victims. The present Attorney General is controlled by the usual \"panama”, that is, possession of scandalous material. 25.) With such power over Director Hoover, defendant used the FBI in harassment of plaintiff as their agents. In 1959, Alex Rosen, Special Assistant Director of the FBI for Jewish Affairs, conspired with Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago office, Auerback, to secretly have plaintiff committed to a mental institution. Forty pages of official FBI documents are reproduced in A WRlT FOR MARTYRS by Eustace Mullins, O.T.U. Christ Church, 1985, documenting this plot. Defendant had the FBI keep plaintiff under daily surveillance for thirty-three years, amassing eight hundred pages of information. Plaintiff was never arrested or charged with anything. This was part of a long list of defendant’s”Special Actions” to destroy plaintiff. Defendant’s long association with such criminal groups as the Mafia, Mossad and other international criminal groups qualifies this action under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act by their established pattern of behavior towards plaintiff under USC 18-1961, act or threat of murder, arson; USC 18-1952 relating to racketeering, USC 18-1963, criminal penalties relating thereto; USC 18-1961, notes 15, 17, 19, illegitimate associations; note 117, murder; note 43, overt act; note 51 conspiracy; note 110, conspiracy as a predicate act; USC 18-1963, property is forfeit to the United States, assets to be seized, punitive damages. Hate Crimes Statistic Act USC 28-534, an action which creates anger, fear, alarm or resentment based upon racial, ethnic, gender or religious bias with conduct designed solely to threaten, terrorize or injure others. Exhibit C. 26.) Defendant’s criminal reputation was noted by Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, addressing the Schiller Club at Howard University, Washington, D.C. Sept. 16, 1992 as follows: ‘The Anti-Defamation League wants to lynch black people. They’re for you only if you are a pagan, an ignorant person, but not if you are truly a Jew, or a Christian, or a Muslim.\" Dr. Muhammad is one of the most respected physicians in Washington, a fact recognized by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, when she proclaimed July 11, 1992 as \"Abdul Alim Muhammad Day”. 27.) The New Federalist newspaper in Washington D.C. headlined the following, WASHINGTON PRESS CONFERENCE DENOUNCES THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE AS GANGSTERS. The Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B'Rith, notorious for its defense of the international drug cartel, and its smearing of political enemies as ‘anti- Semites’ was denounced at a press conference here as having nothing to do with civil rights, but as being a gangster organization with political motives which should be treated as such. At the press conference, Dr. Muhammad rejected charges that he and the Nation of Islam are Anti-Semitic, and said that the slanders emanate from the World Jewish Congress meeting in Brussels, Belgium. Lawrence Freeman outlined the history of the Anti- Defamation League. The ADL was funded in the early part of this century as a public relations front for the Jewish branch of organized criminals. Many of Meyer Lansky’s top lieutenants were always among the ADL’s biggest contributors. In 1985, the ADL gave its Torch of Liberty to gangster Moe Dalitz, a big shot in the National Crime Syndicate and a close ally of Meyer Lansky. It is high time that people stop cowering to the ADL for fear of being called Anti-Semitic. It is a bunch of gangsters tied into organized crime and the intemational drug trade.\" 28.) Plaintiff quotes the following description of defendant from The Campaigner ; Dec., 1978, the special issue, \"Zionism is not Judaism\", page 21. “The B'Nai B'Rith was a British Intelligence cult dedicated to the destruction of the American Republic. It was an arm of British Intelligence with that chartered purpose at the time of its founding in 1843, and remains so to this day. The founder of B’Nai B'Rith was Henry Lord Palmerston, then British Foreign Minister, who simultaneously created the international Zionist movement, in the period of 1843-1860. Zionism was only one of tens of cults created under Palmerston, some 'Jewish’ and some ‘Christian’ in name, and spread across Europe and America as subversive arms of the British Empire. Each cult was modelled on the Ashmolean Scottish Rite of Freemasomy -- of which Palmerston was Grand Master -- itself modelled on Ptolemaic Egypt’s death cult of Isis.\" 29.) Defendant not only qualifies to be charged under RICO but also under the statutes outlawing criminal syndicalism by its continuous association with other terrorist organizations, as follows: \"Corpus Juris Secundum 46 462b. Statutes against criminal syndicalism apply to corporations as well as to individuals organizing or belonging to criminal syndicalist society; evidence of the character and activities of other organizations with which the accused is affiliated is admissible.” \"Corpus Juris Secundum 22 Criminal Law 185 (10): Conspiracy and Monopolies: Where the statute makes mere membership in an organization formed to promote syndicalism a crime, without an overt act, the offense is indictable in any county into which a member may go during the continuance of his membership, and this is true although such a member"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"comes into a county involuntarily. People v. Johansen, 226 P 634, 66 C.A. 343.” \"Corpus Juris Secundum 22A -- Criminal Syndicalism; In a prosecution for being a member of an organization which teaches and abets criminal syndicalism, evidence of crimes committed by past or present members of the organization in their capacity as members is admissible to show its character. People v. LaRue 216 P 627 CA 276.” WHEREFORE, plaintiff's civil rights, freedom of speech, and family having been denied and injured by defendant, plaintiff subsequently suffering severe deprivation, emotional shock, intense mental stress, and placed in fear of his life over many years by defendant’s incitement of hate crimes against him, plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of fifty million dollars, ($50,000,000.00) for defendant’s knowing and willful acts to injure him, and punitive damages in the sum of fifty million dollars, ($50,000,000.00) for defendant’s malicious and intentional crimes and conspiracies to defame and injure plaintiff, and that plaintiff shall have such and other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper, together with costs and disbursements of this actions. 30.) Plaintiff demands trial by jury. By _________________ Respectfully submitted: EUSTACE C. MULLINS ************************************************ 02.) Eustace Mullins v. Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith Update of February 20, 1994, by Eustace Mullins The historic lawsuit which Eustace Mullins filed in the Federal Court in the District of Columbia December 7, 1993, asking one hundred million dollars in damages has been met by the usual response from the defendants: a motion to dismiss. Every lawsuit which Mullins has filed in the past forty years has been met with the same response.There has never been any denial of the facts which, in law, are thus admitted. The motion to dismiss is always based on some technical grounds invoked by the private lawyers and judges club. Mullins, representing himself as Pro Propria personae, in his Proper Person, is an intruder in this swank private club and he is fortunate not to be arrested for trespassing because he does not have a membership card in good standing. Like most Americans, Mullins is barred from the courts unless he agrees to resign all of his Constitutional rights and turn over his complaint to a lawyer, who will charge him a substantial fee for becoming his attorney of record, and who will charge him many thousands of dollars to lose the case."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Congressman George Hansen is again in Federal prison at Petersburg, Virginia because he has always paid for the best legal talent that money could buy. He has always been convicted every time he has gone to court. Lyndon LaRouche recently was released after spending five years in prison on trumped up charges. He paid his lawyers millions in dollars, in return, they ensured that he would be convicted. The terms of his probation will probably prevent him from engaging in any serious political activity. The Anti-Defamation League attorneys, Arent, Fox, Plotkin and Kahn, who occupy swank offices across the street from the Anti-Defamation League on Connecticut Ave, NW, in Washington D.C., just across the street from the lobbyists' favorite hangout, the plush Mayflower Hotel, contacted Mullins by telephone late one night. The lady lawyer stated she did not have time to work on the case and asked for a one month's extension of time. Mullins then filed a letter with the court that he had not agreed to such an extension and had objected to it. The Anti-Defamation League went into default on this one hundred million dollars on December 27, 1993. On December 30, the lawyers filed a Motion for an Enlargement of Time with the court. Mullins was not mailed a copy of this motion and had no opportunity to respond or object to it. On January 7, 1994, Judge Harold Greene gave the Anti-Defamation League an order allowing them to answer by January 24, 1994, although they were already in default. Mullins received a copy of the order, and promptly notified the court he had not received the defendant's motion, NOTICE OF NON- RECEIPT OF DEFENDANT'S PLEADINGS. On January 24, the Anti-Defamation League filed its Motion to Dismiss. The lawyers added a Motion to Strike the Allegations of the complaint, which they described as \"impertinent and scandalous\" citing par. 10 of the complaint that the ADL had committed the crime of genocide against plaintiff. Article II Genocide Act \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical or religious group... causing serious bodily or mental harm in members of the group, imposing measures intended to prevent birth within the group.\" Plaintiff cited this in referring to the numerous times that the ADL had had him fired from well-paying jobs, preventing him from marrying or raising a family. The ADL was scandalized by this well-documented claim. In an Answering Motion, to Deny Defendant's Motion to Strike Allegations, Mullins began his Motion to Deny with this paragraph: \"Plaintiff is impressed by defendant's chutzpah in characterizing selected paragraphs of Plaintiff's complaint as \"impertinent, scandalous matter\", this coming from an organization which for more than a year has been pilloried on the front pages of the nation's press for its role in bribing public officials, stealing police files, and which now faces many lawsuits from outraged citizens because of its scandalous activities in spying upon them and interfering in their private lives.\" The many facts cited in the complaint were taken from dated issues of the Washington Post and other establishment media, yet the ADL denounced these facts as \"devoid of credulity\". The ADL's Motion to Dismiss denounced Mullins' complaint as a \"rambling, disconnected and incoherent tale of treachery and deceit\". The ADL also denounced Mullins' application"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations) to this complaint because of the ADL's long and notorious associations with the mafia, including its control by Meyer Lansky and Moe Dalitz for many years. It remains to be seen whether this hysterical invective from the ADL will influence Judge Harold Greene, famed for his historic break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph Co. Leftwing apologists had been embarrassed for many years by the fact that the United States had the world's most efficient telephone system and the Soviet Union had the worst. Although Judge Greene's decision did nothing to improve the Soviet's telephone system, it did succeed in doubling the average monthly telephone bill of every American citizen. Although Mullins cited almost a half century of the ADL's ongoing conspiracy against him, the ADL ignored this and attacked a number of Mullins' paragraphs of his complaint as being invalid under the staute of limitations. One of the established principles of law is that there is no statute of limitations on conspiracy. Mullins has now filed his Amended Complaint: in par. 5 he states, \"defendant has throughout this cited period maintained files on plaintiff, a private citizen, in violation of plaintiff's right to privacy. Defendant has monitored plaintiff's speeches, articles and books, maintained surveillance of plaintiff, authored vicious attacks against plaintiff, and furnished newspapers, agencies and officials with false material designed to injure and defame plaintiff. \"Par. 6 Defendant's ostensible reason for committing these crimes against plaintiff was its claim that the plaintiff represented a threat to the Jewish community in the United States, and that plaintiff was a vicious 'anti-Semite'. Plaintiff will prove to a jury that these claims are totally false. Far from being an 'anti-Semite', plaintiff is a direct descendant of Shem, founder of the Shemites or Semitic line, and could hardly be anti-himself.\" In his Motion to Deny Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, Mullins states that \"Defendant's motives for spying on plaintiff and conspiring against plaintiff are also a matter of public record , that defendant, acting as an illegal and unregistered agent of the State of Israel, was determined to crush and destroy all critics and criticisms of the State of Israel's subversive activities within the United States. As a supposed \"charitable and philanthropic organization\", defendant cloaked its illegal activities in a transparent guise of \"protecting\" America's Jewish community feom racial and religious attacks from the likes of plaintiff. This guise bears a suspicious mirror image of the \"protection racket\" of defendant's historic allly in the United States, the Mafia. The facts are exactly the opposite to the claims of this defendant. While the defendant was preying upon the American Jewish community, and extorting from them immense sums for its protection racket, plaintiff was working closely with many outstanding Jewish intellectual leaders to protect American Jewish communities from this protection racket and to free the American Jewish community from the horrendous burden placed upon it by this gangster element in the Jewish community. Because plaintiff publicized the defendant's close working relationship with the mafia and other gangster elements, the defendant intensified its public crucifixion of plaintiff as \"anti-Semitic\", \"a notorious anti-Semite\", \"nazi\", and other false and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"defamatory epithets which defendant publicly published as being solely originating with and sponsored and inspired by the defendant. The purpose of these nationally syndicated smears against plaintiff, extending for almost half a century, was to prevent the American public from reading plaintiff's books or listening to his documented information which exposed the gangster background of this defendant.\" Mullins also notes in his Amended Complaint that \"Although plaintiff is only one of thousands of innocent Americans who have been victimized by the vicious conspiracies of said defendant, plaintiff has been for many years considered the No. 1 target of defendant because of his investigative researches into defendant's criminal activities, which have been front page news for many months.\" If Judge Greene will allow a jury to hear this case, Mullins has hundreds of pages of documentation detailing the ADL's systematic takeover and subversion of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and many other agencies. When Admiral Inman was nominated to become Secretary of Defense, he was informed that the New York Times and its Zionist hatchetman, William Safire, would lead a national campaign to prevent his confirmation because he had once hesitated to share CIA information with the State of Israel. When he went public for his reason for not seeking confirmation because of this scheduled smear campaign, he was pilloried throughout the American press by every columnist as being paranoid, mentally unstable, and a nitwit. Not once was his publicly announced reason for declining the appointment, that the Zionist hatchetmen were out to get him, ever mentioned. Mullins hopes that his lawsuit will launch a national liberation campaign to rescue our national government from Zionist takeover and systematic subversion. The ADL also realizes that the stakes are high, and they will do anything to prevent public revelation of this campaign. Although Mullins sent out 200 press releases to the national media about this lawsuit, not one major newspaper mentioned a hundred million dollar historic lawsuit in the nation's capital. Three thousand well paid \"investigative journalists\" in Washington knew that their careers would be over if they dared to print a word about a suit against the Anti-Defamation League.  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EUSTACE C. MULLINS, Plaintiff, v. ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE OF B'NAI B'RITH, Defendant Civil Action No. 93-2497 AMENDED COMPLAINT  Parties"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1. Plaintiff, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as Pro Propria personae, is a citizen in good standing of the State of Virginia, of the United States of America, residing at 126 Stanton Place, Staunton, Virginia, 24401. 2. Defendant, the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith, is an international intelligence and espionage group for the State of Israel, acting as the central intelligence agency for hundreds of Zionist activist and lobbying groups tax exempted by the government of the United States to illegally represent the State of Israel as unregistered foreign agents. Address is 1100 Connecticut Ave., NW, Washington, District of Columbia, 20036.  Jurisdiction 3. This court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to USC 18-1961, 1963, 1965 (a) (b) (c) (d) ; USC 28-234; USC 42-1981, 1983, 1985; and the Constitution of the United States, First and Sixth Amendments. Facts 4. Plaintiff respectfully alleges that said defendant has for almost half a century waged an ongoing campaign of harassment, intimidation and terrorism against plaintiff and against members of the plaintiff's family. 5. Defendant has throughout this cited period maintained files on plaintiff, a private citizen, in violation of plaintiff's right to privacy. Defendant has monitored plaintiff's speeches, articles and books, maintained surveillance of plaintiff, authored vicious attacks against plaintiff and circulated these attacks nationally, and furnished newspapers, agencies and officials with false material designed to injure and defame plaintiff. 6. Defendant's ostensible reason for committing these crimes against plaintiff was its claim that the plaintiff represented a threat to the Jewish community in the United States, and that plaintiff was a vicious 'anti-Semite'. Plaintiff will prove to a jury that these claims are totally false. Far from being an 'anti-Semite', plaintiff is a direct descendant of Shem, founder of the Shemites or Semitic line, and could hardly be anti-himself. Throughout the period that defendant has been committing the crimes against plaintiff in its ongoing conspiracy against plaintiff, plaintiff was working closely with many outstanding righteous intellectual Jewish leaders throughout the United States to free the Jewish community of the United States from the heavy hand of defendant and its allies, the gangster element of the Jewish people. 7. Defendant's ongoing conspiracy against plaintiff originated from racial and religious bias, prejudice and hatred of plaintiff. 8. Throughout the period of defendant's ongoing conspiracy against plaintiff, defendant acted overtly to prevent plaintiff from circulating his writings, or to receive income from his writings, as overt censorship and intimidation. Defendant caused an entire edition of plaintiff's books to be burned in Germany during the United States military occupation of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"that nation. Defendant repeatedly had plaintiff discharged from well-paying jobs, including a position on the staff of the Library of Congress, the American Petroleum Institute, and the Chicago Motor Club. Rule 8a, which requires a short, plain statement of the facts precluded plaintiff from listing in this amended complaint all of the crimes committed against plaintiff by said defendant, but plaintiff is prepared to present to a jury complete documentation of the ongoing role played by said defendant in its ongoing conspiracy. Although plaintiff is only one of thousands of innocent Americans who have been victimized by the vicious conspiracies of said defendant, plaintiff has for many years been considered the No. 1 target of defendant, because of his investigative researches into defendant's criminal activities, which have been front page news in the national press for months. Defendant has carried on this campaign of hatred against plaintiff as part of its illegal activities in representing the State of Israel in the United States, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Title 22, US Code 611 et seq . which provides criminal penalties for failure of propagandists and others active in this country on behalf of foreigners to file copies of all political propaganda conspicuously, and to keep and reveal records of their activities. WHEREFORE, plaintiff's civil rights, freedom of speech, and family having been injured by defendant, plaintiff suffering therefrom severe deprivation, emotional shock, intense mental stress, and placed in fear of his life over many years by defendant's incitement of hate crimes against him, plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of sixty million dollars ($60,000,000.00) for defendant's knowing and willfull acts to injure him, and punitive damages in the sum of sixty million dollars ($60,000,000.00) for defendant's intentional and malicious crimes and conspiracies to defame and injure plaintiff, and that plaintiff shall have such and other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper, together with costs and disbursements of this action. ************************************************ 03.) Judges or Criminals? August 1994 Although many patriots have been given short shrift in American courts, few of them realize just how many of the misfits on the federal bench are thieves, drunkards, or mentally ill. A carefully researched book by Joseph Goulden, THE BENCH WARMERS (Waybright and Talley, NYC, 1974), reveals some amazing inside stories on the ability of judges to warp and destroy American Christian civilization. For instance, we all know of the havoc created among the nation’s criminal control systems by “bleeding heart” judges, who immediately turn rapists, killers and other thugs loose to prey upon the unarmed citizens, while handing out a thirty-five-year sentence to Howard Hunt on the charge that"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"he knew about a burglary in which nothing was stolen. Amazingly enough, Goulden traces the creation of this Thug’s Paradise in America to two judges on the District of Columbia Appeals Court in Washington. They are two Jews, Judge David Bazelon and Judge Charles Fahey. Like many Jews, Bazelon underwent extensive psychoanalysis, and he adopted this as the solution to all problems. Born in a Jewish ghetto in Chicago, he became a tax lawyer and contributed heavily to the Democratic Party. A close friend of Sen. Paul Douglas, he was appointed to the Appeals Court by Harry Truman, and American justice hasn’t been the same since. Bazelon soon revealed his belief that criminals should not be punished, but that they should be returned to society, where, with psychiatric “help” they would immediately become useful citizens. District attorneys found it almost impossible to get Judge Bazelon to send a robber, a rapist or a killer to jail. Judge Bazelon also dismissed many carefully prepared cases on the grounds that the criminals’ “rights” had in some technical manner been infringed upon. Another Jew on the D.C. Appeals bench, Judge Charles Fahey, enthusiastically adopted Bazelon’s theories about “mental health” and soon they were freeing dangerous criminals on the flimsiest technicalities. The result was that Washington became the most dangerous city in America to walk in after dark. As the years went by, and Bazelon continued his “mental health” campaign, Washington became almost as dangerous by day, as the criminals realized that with a patron saint of thugs like Bazelon, they did not have to commit their crimes under the cover of darkness. It was the Supreme Court which really turned Washington into a black capital, with the infamous decree outlawing contracts with racial covenants. The result was that the Whites had to flee to the suburbs, as Jewish speculators blockbusted one area after another. Goulden’s book tells the story of how Abe Marovitz became a federal judge in Chicago. Colonel Jake Arvey, the Jewish political boss of Chicago, took Abe, who was then a sergeant, to the officers’ club in Manila during World War II. The other officers promptly threw Abe out. After the war, Abe became the mouthpiece for the top hoods in the Chicago area, including triggermen of the Al Capone gang. Jake asked him how he could make it up to him for the unfortunate episode in Manila, and Abe answered: “Make me a Federal judge.” Marovitz tells the story on himself that when a routine investigation was made concerning his appointment, a chum called him up and said: “Judge, the Gees have been around askin’ questions. I didn’t tell them nuttin’.” Another Chicago judge, William Campbell, amassed a twenty million dollar fortune in real estate while on the bench, although his only income was his judge’s salary, beginning at $8,000 and rising to $22,500. Campbell became a federal judge as a result of his friendship with Bishop Shiel of Chicago, who was such a fanatical Zionist that most area Catholics called him “Rabbi” Shiel. He spent much of his time at Jewish functions, dedicating a new synagogue or raising money for the United Jewish Appeal. As a result, he became Col. Jake Arvey’s right-hand man in political wheeling and dealing. Judge Campbell fitted into the picture, hence the twenty million"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"dollars in real estate that he was allowed to amass. Goulden has some interesting background on the “Hero of the Watergate Trials”, the “firm, courageous” Judge Sirica. Goulden reveals that Sirica was a law school dropout who operated a newsstand for a year at 9th and D Streets in Washington. An article in the Washingtonian magazine called him unfit for the bench and cited “his careless legal errors, his short temper, his inattentiveness to court proceedings, his misguided view of the purpose of judicial power, his lack of compassion for his fellow human beings.” These qualities came to the nation’s attention during the Watergate Trials, in which Sirica apparently was used as a tool to prepare the way for Nelson Rockefeller’s assumption of the Presidency, as it was impossible for Rockefeller to ever be elected, as after he took the wife of the employee of the Rockefeller Foundation, had a child by her, and finally married her, the victim of his ruthless passions bearing the curious name of “Happy”. After reading Goulden’s book one begins to understand why free-born American citizens have to cringe and grovel before the Supermen on the bench, nearly all of whom have been personally approved for their offices by the Anti-Defamation League for their support of Zionism. A Christian approaches these wielders of power as a slave approaches King Herod, for the guarantees of the Constitution mean nothing to the arrogant “benchwarmers”, many of whom, as Goulden tells us, are deranged alcoholics on the take. The corruption of the judiciary is not as widely known as the corruption of the Executive and the Legislative branches of government, but the sad fact is the delicate system of checks and balances set up by the Founding Fathers to AVOID TYRANNY has been CORRUPTED by the Jew. ************************************************ 04.) * * * PRESS RELEASE * * * Milestone In Historic Case Against The ADL On January 4, 1995, Eustace Mullins filed his brief against the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith. The brief was filed in the federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Washington D.C. This is a case which has made history from its inception. It is the ONLY civil suit ever filed directly against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) by one of its VICTIMS. Mullins filed his suit in federal court on December 7, 1993. He asked $50 million in damages plus $50 million in punitive damages from the terrorist group after they had conducted a forty-six-year war against him, on all fronts. They smeared him nationally in libelous articles, repeatedly had him fired from well-paying professional jobs, and when he refused to abandon his patriotic work, the ADL then launched furious attacks against"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"members of his family. The ADL attorneys, Arent, Fox & Kintner, which occupies four entire floors in the most expensive office address in Washington on Connecticut Avenue, opposite the swank Mayflower Hotel, first demanded an extension of time beyond the customary twenty-one days allowed for a response. When this was not forthcoming, they went into default, failing to answer within the required period. The case was then assigned to a mysterious Washington figure, Judge Harold H. Greene, who gave the ADL an extension. Although there were none of the customary pre-trial maneuvers, such as depositions or interrogations, Judge Greene suddenly dismissed Mullins’ lawsuit on May 24, 1994. He specifically dismissed the suit “with prejudice”, which meant that the ADL was now granted permanent immunity from any further lawsuit by Mullins, as the case could not be refiled. Mullins promptly filed an appeal with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In his appellant brief, Mullins cites ten points which are grounds for reversal of Judge Greene’s sudden decision. First, Mullins pointed out that no proof had been presented by the ADL that his charges were wrong. Second, he noted that the court had failed to deal with the basic issue of the lawsuit, that the ADL had maintained illegal surveillance of Mullins for almost fifty years, monitoring his employment, his personal habits, his associates, and maintaining illegal files on Mullins which were freely dispensed to anyone who wished to attack him. Third, Mullins noted that the court had failed to deal with the fact that the ADL had continuously harassed and intimidated him for almost half a century. Fourth, Mullins pointed out that the court had failed to deal with the issue of criminal syndicalism, a serious crime in American jurisprudence. Mullins pointed out that the ADL had been maintaining a close working relationship with the two Godfathers of the national Crime Syndicate, or Mafia, for many years, in violation of numerous statutes prohibiting acts of criminal syndicalism. Fifth, Mullins noted that the court had refused him permission to amend his complaint, which is usually routinely granted in any federal case. Sixth, Mullins noted that the court had failed to deal with charges that the ADL had violated Article II of the Genocide Act in committing acts of genocide against him. Seventh, Mullins pointed out that the court refused to allow the case to proceed to trial even though all his allegations against the ADL had been admitted by them and were a matter of public record, having been repeatedly published with no denial from the ADL, and that they were open and notorious, having been front page headlines for many months. Eighth, Mullins pointed out that the court erred in barring his claims because of the statute of limitations, as he had pointed out that all the allegations were part of a continuous and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ongoing criminal conspiracy against him, continuing to the present time. Nine, Mullins says the court erred in dismissing his complaint as “difficult to read”. He says this is an editorial decision, not a judicial one. Ten, Mullins pointed out that the court had violated the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution by denying him a jury trial, which he had specifically requested in his complaint. The Washington press corps is forbidden to interview Judge Harold H. Greene, and his name is never mentioned in the press. He has managed to conceal his identity despite the fact that he is a public figure on the public payroll. In addition to his present munificent salary, he also collects $109,000 a year pension from a previous post as judge of the Superior Court in Washington D.C. He also conceals the fact that he is actually a German immigrant named Heinz Grunhaus, who managed to enter the United States in some manner at the height of the Second World War. He then returned to a defeated Germany as part of a horde of vengeance-seeking German Jews led by his associate, HENRY KISSINGER, who had full authority of martial law and the entire United States Army to wreak their will on the captive German people. Millions of Germans were tortured, starved, and killed in a reign of terror which lasted many years, and which is the origin of the Holocaust story. After serving as a highly placed “intelligence” officer in Germany, Grunhaus returned to the United States and was given an important executive position with the Department of Justice in Washington. The Anti-Defamation League commissioned him to establish a “Civil Rights” department, despite the fact that all American citizens’ rights were already protected by the Constitution of the United States of America and its Bill of Rights. Greene proceeded to write the historic Civil Rights and Voting Rights bills, which were promptly passed by Congress. President Lyndon B. Johnson rewarded him for this work by making him Judge of the Superior Court. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter recognized his work in giving the federal government new and unprecedented authority over the private lives of every American in these dictatorial bills. Greene was one of some three hundred federal judges appointed by Carter. They were ALL extreme leftwingers from various “minorities”, but mostly Jews, and their court decisions since their appointments have left the entire nation in disarray. They seized control of the nation’s schools, created enormous debts for states and municipalities by oppressive mandates to spend millions of dollars which they did not have, and pushed the nation well along the road to total ruin. It is hardly coincidental that the Anti-Defamation League went to great lengths to infiltrate the judiciary, by choosing candidates through bar committees and other political operations. They were so successful that when the Godfather of the Mafia, Moe Dalitz, died after seventy years of continuous criminal activity, the New York Times gleefully noted that he had \"never been convicted” of any crime! Mullins’ appeal points out that the law of this case is most elementary, involving classic instances of violations of his right to privacy, freedom of speech, censorship, and genocide,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"as well as hate crimes against churches and against members of his family. He concludes this appeal by requesting the Court of Appeals to reverse the dismissal with prejudice dictated by Judge Greene, and to either instruct the lower court to conduct a trial, or alternatively, to enter a judgment for damages in his favor and against the ADL for $100,000,000. ************************************************ 05.)

Statement of the Nature of the Case This is an appeal from the judgment of the United States District of Columbia granting a dismissal with prejudice in favor or appellees and against appellant. Points of Error Appellant retries for reversal on the following points of error: 1.) The error of the court in granting the dismissal with prejudice in favor of appellees and against appellant when there was no proof presented that appellant’s charges were in error. There was no hearing, no discovery, and no investigation of the issues presented by appellant in his complaint. 2.) The error of the court in failing to deal with the basic issue of appellant before the court, that appellees had maintained illegal surveillance of appellant, maintained illegal files of appellant’s activities, and continuously monitored appellant’s habits, associates and employment on a continuous and ongoing basis for some forty-six years to the present time. 3.) The error of the court in failing to give a hearing to appellant’s allegations that appellees have been regularly engaged in harassment and intimidation of appellant on a continuous and ongoing basis for some forty-six years or more to the present time. 4.) The error of the court in failing to hear appellant’s allegation that appellees have been continuously engaged in acts of criminal syndicalism including close working relationships with the two godfathers of the Mafia or National Crime Syndicate, in violation of numerous statutes prohibiting acts of criminal syndicalism. 5.) The error of the court in refusing to allow appellant to amend his complaint. 6.) The error of the court in failing to hear appellant’s allegations of violations of Article II of the Genocide Act by appellees against appellant. 7.)

The error of the court in dismissing appellant’s complaint as “difficult to read”, and “has failed to allege a short, plain statement”, placing the burden on appellant of reciting events, offenses and violations occurring over a period of some forty-six years in a “short/plain statement” which the court dismissed in editorial judgments by the court rather than judicial decisions. 10.) The error of the court in denying appellant a trial by jury as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, although appellant had specifically requested that this action be tried by a jury. Arguments and Authorities The law of the case is most elementary. It is a timely appeal to the United States Court of Appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. It involves violations of civil rights, freedom of speech, genocide, censorship, hate crimes and other offenses by appellees against appellant. These matters are dealt with in USC 18-1961, 1963, 1965 (a) (b) (c) (d); USC 28-1331, 1332, 1343; USC 28-534; USC 42-1981, 1983, 1985, and the Constitution of the United States, First, Sixth and Seventh Amendments. Summary The court erred in refusing to conduct a trial on the facts alleged by appellant against appellees. The court’s reasons for denying a trial are clearly erroneous and not supported by law. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, appellant respectfully submits that the Court should reverse the judgment of the court below as entered May 24, 1994, and should remand the case to the court below with instructions to conduct a trial, or alternatively, to enter a judgment for damages in favor of appellant against appellees.

MULLINS ************************************************ 06.) J’Accuse! 1995 J’Accusel! [French for “I Accuse!“] This is the title of the French novelist Emile Zola’s trenchant work of the nineteenth century, which accused the Government of France of brazen corruption. Today, in the United States, I accuse the federal government of planning and perpetrating the most horrible crimes, a series which culminated in the April 19,1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. This was a deliberate conspiracy by corrupt and treasonous elements in the federal agencies in Washington as part of a plan to provoke martial law, confiscate legal guns from American citizens, and to wipe out the citizens’ militias of the several states. For the past fifty years, I have repeatedly warned conservative groups throughout this nation that when any person comes into your meetings, demands that you take more stringent action against the enemies of America, and urges you to bomb a building or to assassinate an official, that person has revealed himself as an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or of its parent group, the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith. Most patriotic groups chafe under the belief that they are not accompIishing enough, that they are not moving fast enough. Their younger members are easy prey for anyone who comes in and says, “You guys are a bunch of pansies. Why don’t you let the enemy know that you mean business? Direct action now -- that’s the way to make them fear you.” The bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City can be seen to be part of an ongoing pattern of activity. But is it more logical to draw a direct line from a small group of inexperienced militiamen in Michigan to a couple of rootless army veterans to the federal building in Oklahoma City -- or does it make more sense to draw a direct line from the massacre of the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, to the Waco Church Holocaust in Texas, to the New York Trade Center building which was bombed in New York City, to the federal office building in Oklahoma City, a line beginning with the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, leading directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and its many agents and informants throughout these United States? After this latest outrage, there was an immediate reaction, unrehearsed and unaffected by anyone else’s opinions, among conservatives throughout the United States, that the Oklahoma City bombing could not be anything but a federal operation. These opinions have flooded the nation’s airwaves and the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"front pages of major newspapers. When I was asked about it, I replied without even thinking, “It’s a standard FBI operation.” After all, I have been chronicling these FBI atrocities, whose victims have included myself and many members of my family, for more than fifty years. My compatriot M. J. (Red) Beckman, with whom I addressed members of the MOM, Militia of Montana, in Idaho only a few days before this latest outrage, was quoted on the front page of the Wall Street Journal , April 24, 1995, “It has all the earmarks of a CIA, FBI, or BATF operation,” when he was asked about the Oklahoma City bombing. On the widely viewed 60 Minutes program of April 23, 1995, reporter Leslie Stahl was horrified during her interview with Gen. Norman Olson, commander of the Michigan militia, when he observed, “I feel sure that you will find that this bombing is a federal government operation.\" “How can you say such a thing?”shrieked Stahl, reeling back as though she had been struck a mortal blow. “How could you think that our federal government would do such a thing?” Not all of us live in the cozy liberal cocoon in which Leslie Stahl has wrapped herself. We deal with the real world, a world in which politicians of the stripe of President Clinton know that if you want to carry out a program, you have to infiltrate and control the opposition, you have to shed some blood, and you have to weep for the innocent babies whom you have ordered to be murdered. Will Bill Clinton be remembered as the King Herod of our day? All over the United States, conservatives on talk shows, either the hosts or the callers, or both, are echoing General Olson’s belief that the Oklahoma City bombing could only have been part of a federal program. There is an ancient question -- Cui bono? Who stands to gain the most from this bombing? Bill Clinton answered that question a few hours after the bombing, when he announced to the press that for the first time, he now believed that he had a chance to be re-elected in 1996! He then urged Congress to pass the omnibus Anti- Terrorism Bill, Bill No. 896, which had been hopelessly stalled in Congress, with no chance of getting enough votes for passage. It had been written by the Anti-Defamation League, and introduced to Congress by the Congressional spokesman for the Anti- Defamation League, Rep. Charles Schumer (D-NY). During the past several months, leaders of militia groups throughout the United States had been warned that something big was coming down, that the federal government was planning an incident which would provoke martial law throughout the United States, resulting in confiscation of all privately owned guns, and the forcible dissolution of all citizens’ militia units. The April 19, 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City proved to be the planned provocation. The idea that any person associated with any militia unit would carry out such a bombing, whose only possible result would be the federal outlawing of all militia units, was unbelievable. After the bombing, media coverage featured maps drawn of all militia units in the United States. These maps were prominently labeled, “Prepared by the Anti-Defamation League”. Tom Halpern and other officials of the Anti-Defamation League appeared on national television, boasting that they had been tracking and monitoring the militia for many months. Peter Jennings, Dan Rather, and other commentators repeatedly noted that “The Anti-Defamation League has done a great job of tracking these militia units.” If the Anti- Defamation League had been tracking the militia operations in painstaking detail"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"throughout the United States, as they boasted, why would they have stood by and let them blow up the federal oflice building in Oklahoma City? This bombing revealed the Anti-Defamation League’s hand, its long-standing determination to wipe out all citizens’ militia units throughout the United States. Why does the ADL insist on this goal? Because the militia is now the only organized threat to the Zionists’ absolute control of the United States. The ADL is in total control of the FBI, the Department of Justice, all federal agencies, the military forces, and the three branches of the national government. The only remaining area of resistance to their total control of our nation is the state militias, which are now practicing maneuvers in twenty-six states. The news of the Oklahoma City bombing removed the testimony of Hillary and Bill Clinton before Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, in the Whitewater Hearings, from the front page to the back pages of some newspapers. It never made the press in most cities. The news that thousands more innocents had been massacred in Rwanda also failed to make most of the newspapers. Reams of coverage was devoted to the innocent babies killed in Oklahoma City by the same newspapers which had ignored the burning alive of many babies at their church in Waco. Attorney General Reno had condemned them by claiming that they had been the victims of “child abuse”. After they were dead and their little bodies bulldozed into the ground by government agents, Reno admitted that it all had been a lie, and that there had never been any child abuse in Waco. Govemment agents admitted that one of the suspects in the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh, had been bitter about the Waco Holocaust. They have offered no clues as to how a young, penniless, unemployed Army veteran could have amassed the resources necessary to carry out this massive bombing operation. Bets are now being taken as to whether McVeigh will go the way of Lee Harvey Oswald, before he appears for trial. Perhaps he will be “overcome by remorse” and will be a “suicide” in his cell. In addition to urging Congress to pass the ADL’s Omnibus Anti-Terrorism Bill at once, President Clinton also has submitted demands to Congress for a special counter-terrorism fund at the FBI; new authority for the FBI to combat suspected terrorist organizations, meaning, presumably, any group which dares to disagree with the Democratic Party’s agenda; and to give the FBI unlimited authority to bug telephones, seize mail, seize credit card records, and to employ many other types of electronic surveillance. Meanwhile, the FBI is maintaining its Keystone Cops image by its frantic efforts to solve this “crime”, including the initial release that two suspects seen fleeing the scene just before the Oklahoma City bombing were obviously of “Arabic descent”. An Arab- American was arrested because some ordinary electric cord was found in his luggage in London; he was promptly released, as was an AWOL soldier in California who had been the object of a nationwide alert as “John Doe No. 2.” He was also released and returned to his Army unit. The haste to bring in these \"culprits” may well have been due to FBI concerns that the public might well believe that the only possible perpetrator of this bombing would be the FBI itself, or its multitudinous agents. To understand why the FBI would be involved in planning such a terrible atrocity, we have"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"only to look at the known involvement of the FBI in many previous bombings and atrocities. There was the murder raid in Idaho, in which the FBI agents were instructed that no member of the Weaver family was to be allowed to remain alive; the Waco Church Holocaust, in which many worshippers, including innocent children, were burned alive while worshipping in their church, an atrocity which surpasses the worst accusations made against the Nazis in Germany; the New York Trade Center bombing, in which a rented truck filled with explosives was parked at the building, the identical plan in which a rented truck was parked at the Oklahoma City federal office building. The rented vehicle in both cases is a very important factor in identifying FBI participation; professional terrorists would have stolen a vehicle which could not be traced to them. FBI rules demand the use of a rented vehicle, so that it can be traced for the all important Moscow show trial which is so crucial to their techniques. The New York Times has been printing reams of copy about the New York World Trade Center bombing, in which it repeatedly identifies the key figure in the operation, from the very beginning, as a paid FBI informant, Emad Salem, a former Egyptian Army officer who was recruited by the FBI for this bombing. Do we really need any more proof that this was a typical ADL-FBI operation? In Los Angeles some months ago, several youths were arrested and charged with plans to bomb buildings. They indignantly protested that the only mention of any bombing had come from a paid FBI informant who had infiltrated their meetings, and who had then turned them in to the FBI in order to collect his pay. Strangely enough, no new information about the Oklahoma City bombings seems to be released to the press. The Washington Post , April 26, 1995 reported that “None of the fifteen ATF employees died in the blast\". There are persistent reports that FBI and ATF agents did not show up at the building the morning of the blast. Perhaps other odd circumstances will emerge later, although it is more probable that we already know as much about this atrocity as we will ever know. To remedy this situation, we need a nationwide drive to demand a full and immediate Congressional investigation of FBI and ADL involvement in the Oklahoma City federal office building bombing, as well as information about any other federal agencies who took part in planning this operation, or who had advance knowledge that it would take place. This writer has insisted for the past thirty years that our own native Gestapo, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which operates solely as a secret police to carry out the desires of its masters, the Anti- Defamation League, be abolished. It is now widely known that the ADL gained total control of the FBI by photographing its legendary director, J. Edgar Hoover, in flagrante delicto with his longtime consort, Clyde Tolson, at their suite at Miami’s Roney Plaza Hotel. The Roney Plaza, a Meyer Schine hotel, not only was the official winter headquarters of the Mafia; it was also the annual retreat of J. Edgar Hoover, who was an honored guest there each winter season, with Clyde Tolson always in attendance. With these photographs, the ADL, and its long-standing ally, the Mafia, attained absolute mastery of J. Edgar Hoover, and the FBI became their willing servant. This Congressional investigation must obtain all memoranda between the FBI and the ADL; all possible contacts in planning these many bombing operations must be interviewed and full statements obtained from each one of them. All federal officials and ADL planners of these criminal syndicalist operations must be prosecuted to the fullest"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"extent of the law. We can no longer allow these menaces to public safety to run amuck. ************************************************ 07.) Waco Revisited -- ADL of B'Nai B'Rith Parade Of The Death Squads New Republican Congress -- Love Feast For Child Killers 09/10/95 We can easily picture Josef Stalin staging a public ceremony to honor the distinguished service of the commandants of his notorious death camps. They had very efficiently killed more than a million Christians a year, during the first forty years of the Bolshevik regime in Russia. It is more difficult for us to envision such a ceremony taking place in the United States. However, C-Span did televise ten days of a recent proceeding in which sleek, well- dressed Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents, and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the American equivalent of the Russian KGB) were brought before a Joint Committee of Congress, chaired by hard-core Republican leaders and forced to listen day after day to encomiums heaped upon them by the admiring Congressmen. Their achievement? They had perpetrated one of the greatest mass atrocities in American history, incinerating many dissidents, including almost two dozen women and children, who had taken refuge in their church. Our story begins on the morning on February 28, 1993, when a column of more than one- hundred heavily armed federal agents wound down a lonely road some ten miles northeast of Waco, Texas. Their mission -- to attack and destroy the congregation of a Christian church, the Branch Davidian subsidiary of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. This mission had been assigned, and was orchestrated throughout the siege, by the sinister agency, the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith, through its subsidiary group, CAN, the Cult Awareness Network, which had infiltrated its agents into the church to set up for the ADL-directed massacre. Their mission was an integral part of the ADL’s nationwide drive to confiscate all guns from citizens of the United States, as part of the ADL mission to make America safe for its Zionist agitprop revolutionaries. MURDER RAID This assault was planned as a classic murder raid, patterned after the Indian raids along the early Texas frontier. These raids were known as “murder raids” because the Indians, hoping to discourage further encroachment on their lands, tried to kill all of the settlers within a given area, including women and children. To justify this bloodthirsty goal, the federal agents knew they had to provoke some resistance from their intended victims. This goal was achieved by broadly advertising that they were intending to attack. The day before the raid, the local newspaper, the Waco Tribune-Herald , had featured a story about"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the Branch Davidian Church and the government’s intentions. The New York Times noted on March 1, 1993 that camera crews were present before the federal agents began their assault, including crews from KWTX, and a camera crew from Dallas, a CNN affiliate, WFAA-TV. It was apparent that a first-rate television event was in the making. THE ATF ATTACKS At the church, the intended victims, led by their young minister, David Koresh, who had legally changed his name from Vernon Wayne Howell in 1991, watched the armed attackers approach and take up their firing positions around the building. When the agents knocked on the church door, David Koresh tried to alert them by yelling, “There are women and children here!” Reassured by this information, the federal agents began firing through the door, wounding Koresh and one of his assistant ministers, who soon died of massive stomach wounds. The armed agents then effected a well-planned assault on the second story of the church, entering through a window. One agent went in first and was followed by four more ATF agents. A burst of gunfire then came from within the building, killing four of the ATF agents. These agents included four men who had travelled the previous year as President Clinton’s personal bodyguards throughout his Presidential campaign. Their deaths were the latest in a long list of casualties among persons who had been close to Clinton. The first agent then emerged from the building, and rejoined his comrades on the ground. A fifty-one day siege ensued. The one-hundred agents at the site was increased to more than four-hundred agents. The ATF agents were replaced by the FBI, which assumed total command over the operation. President Clinton was said to have been incensed over the failure of the ATF to wipe out the defenders of the church during the initial attack. This is the only instance in American history in which a Christian church has been subjected to such a devastating attack by any government agency. Although the Branch Davidian church was a flimsy wooden firetrap, FBI agents later admitted in their testimony that they had never made any provisions either to bring in fire- fighting equipment or to notify area fire departments to stand by to protect the women and children in the church from flames. Later in the siege, the Army’s heaviest tanks were brought in to complete the assault on the church. Our laws strictly forbid the use of military equipment against civilians, but this prohibition was overcome by the Attorney General’s taking advantage of the President’s “war on drugs”. She was informed by ADL agents provocateurs that the Branch Davidians had become very active in producing and selling drugs, and that they had established a “methamphetamine laboratory” in the church. This information, which was later proved to have been entirely false, allowed Reno to call in military assistance. She requested the Army Special Forces to plan for a massive military assault against the Branch Davidians. However, the Army warned her that such a raid on a drug laboratory would inevitably result in heavy civilian casualties. Attorney General Reno assured the Army that she understood the risks, and that she was fully prepared to accept such consequences. It was this agreement between Reno and the Army Special Forces which inevitably doomed the women and children of the church to a horrible death."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO MURDER During the fifty-one-day siege of the church before the final holocaust, a few of the Branch Davidians, women who had taken no part in the firing, were ostentatiously seized by the agents as they emerged from the condemned building, and handcuffed and shackled in full view of those inside the church. They were led away in chains, charged with “conspiracy to murder ATF agents”. In charging these worshippers with conspiracy to murder, the government ignored many published reports that the ATF agents had been shotdown by their own colleagues in a withering crossfire. In fact, the AFT agents, many of whom had never fired their guns in action before, had fired thousands of rounds in an orgy of excessive force, in their anxiety to kill all the congregation as quickly as possible. The actual events were chronicled in Newsweek , April 5, 1993, which appeared a few days after the initial assault. It was headlined, “FRIENDLY FIRE”, with the subhead, “In The Bungled Waco Raid, Federal Agents May Have Been Shot By Their Own Men”. Newsweek went on to state unequivocally, “Some federal law enforcement officials now believe that at least some ATF agents were brought down by friendly fire -- a federal source involved in the Waco situation says that ‘there is evidence that supports the theory of friendly fire.’ The official, who insisted on anonymity, believes that an investigation will show that agents were downed by colleagues. ‘I’m afraid it’s inevitable.“’ This “unnamed federal official” is said by Washington insiders to be none other than the then Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. He was furious at the public embarrassment for which he was held responsible. However, his views were never again expressed publicly. Privately, he tried to get the FBI to accept the ATF bureau as a gift; they refused. He then fired the entire ATF upper echelon. At Bentsen’s insistence, Clinton ordered the FBI to take over the siege of the church, to protect him from further embarrassment. BEHAVIORIST ADVISERS The FBI initially focussed on a psychological waging of the siege, using such favorite Communist tactics as playing loud music and focussing bright lights on the congregation, to wear them down. They had called in their staff “behaviorists”, such as Dr. Murray Samuel Miron, who lists himself in Who’s Who as “psychologist, threat assessor for the FBI, Dept. of State and Dept. of Energy, expert in psycholinguistic profiles of anonymous communications, Office Psycholinguistic Research Center, Syracuse, N.Y.\". The behaviorists ignored the fact that they were dealing with a religious group, and focused on accepted Freudian pschotherapy techniques in dealing with the congregation. The Davidians had been founded by a Bulgarian immigrant, Victor T. Houteff, who wrote The Shepherd’s Rod in 1930, which refined Seventh Day Adventist dogma. The Davidians believed that there would be 140,000 survivors of the coming Apocalypse, who would be the core of a new Kingdom of God modelled on the ancient Kingdom of David. This was a very devout group, which lived by the Bible. NO CHILD ABUSE"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The New York Times reported on March 8, 1993 that twenty-one children came out of the church, noting that “social workers say the children seem well cared for”. A Texas Child Protective Service worker, Joyce Sparks, later testified at the Congressional Hearings that she had spent many hours investigating at the church and had found no evidence of any child abuse. The children had been receiving home schooling by their mothers at the church and were bright and responsive to adult questioners. Nevertheless Attorney General Reno used the pretext of child abuse as part of a three-pronged justification for the final, lethal assault of the murder raid on the church. She had already falsified the story of the “drug laboratory” on the premises; she now publicized the fact that the attack must proceed to “save the children” and a further fantasy from the Anti-Defamation League that the Branch Davidians had been planning a massive attack on the residents of Waco. This was the most nonsensical claim of all. The church was ten miles from Waco; Waco had one- hundred thousand residents, and was a church town which had more than two-hundred churches. Certainly its inhabitants had no reason to fear an assault by the Branch Davidians. In fact, reporters on the scene found that hardly anyone in Waco had ever heard of the Branch Davidians or knew where their church was. On March 3 1, 1993, an attorney hired by Koresh’s family, Dick DeGuerin, visited the church to persuade Koresh to surrender. Koresh seemed more than willing to do so. He had now stood off a huge military assault for more than a month; he had become a national figure; and the New York Times reported that he had hired two New York City lawyers, Michael Kennedy and Kenneth David Burrows, to protect the rights to his life story. In fact, Koresh believed that he had won, and that a surrender on his terms could be concluded. Certainly he had no thought of suicide. Dick DeGuerin informed Jeffrey Jamar, FBI site agent in charge at the assault scene, that Koresh needed a few more days to complete his translation of the Seven Seals, and Jamar assured him that they had all the time in the world, as he later testified before the committee. However, when Jamar notified Washington headquarters that a surrender was imminent on April 14, there was panic in the White House. Plans for an all-out assault were drawn up the next day, approved on April 17, and the final attack began on April 19. Jamar later testified that they did not believe Koresh intended to surrender, but the National Review , Nov. 1, 1993, reported that an almost complete translation of Koresh’s Seven Seals work was later found in the church, indicating that he had been sincere in his assurance that he would surrender as soon as this vital work was completed. COLD-BLOODED MURDER Throughout the siege, telephone lines had been kept open to Washington by the ATF and FBI agents. All negotiations were discussed and approved by Washington. Now the federal officials, panicky at the thought that Koresh would actually surrender, ordered the attack plan for an assault which will “terminate” all of the church members, including the women and children. No one would be allowed to escape alive. To initiate the assault on April 19, 1993, four-hundred tear gas shells of deadly CS gas were fired into the compound. Each shell was clearly marked on its base. “Do Not Use in Enclosed Area” as it was known to be deadly, especially to children and small infants. The Army’s heaviest tanks launched a"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"direct attack on the church building, collapsing its walls, while overhead, the helicopter gunships rained bullets and napalm on the church from above. Gov. Anne Richards had lent Texas Ranger helicopters to take part in the “final solution”. When this was revealed during her campaign for re-election, she was terminated by the voters of Texas. CLINTON’S INFERNO Within minutes, the entire church was ablaze in President Bill Clinton’s long-awaited inferno. A few of the worshippers managed to stagger out through the flames, but most of them died a horrible death. The gas and flames were particularly agonizing for the small infants. Testimony at the hearings revealed that their lungs were seared as they choked on their own saliva, dying in agony. The nation was stunned by the depth of this tragedy. Although the New York Times quoted on April 20, 1993 a statement by Attorney General Reno that she “concluded tonight that in hindsight the Government plan to assault the heavily armed cult near Waco, Texas had been a mistake.” She said on Larry King’s program that it was obviously wrong. Although Reno valiantly asserted that she bore full blame for the horror, the New York Times also quoted Bill Clinton on April 20 in an official White House statement, “I told the Attorney General to do what she thought was right, and I stand by that decision.” In so many words, Clinton himself was assuming full responsibility for the inferno, although he never again admitted that he bore any responsi- blame. BURYING THEIR MISTAKES Government agents hastily bulldozed the entire area of the church, planning to bury forever the results of their murderous conspiracy, keeping the entire area under heavy guard until their “sanitizing” efforts were completed. It seemed that the children of Waco had indeed been buried for all time, until the 1994 elections. An outraged electorate swept many of Clinton’s loonies from office, and left him facing a Republican majority in Congress. This Congress soon announced full-scale hearings into many of his crimes, including the Whitewater conspiracy and the Waco Holocaust. While he retained a Democratic majority, he was secure from any Congressional investigation, but now he stood bare to the wind of exposure. A Joint Committee on Government Oversight, co-chaired by Congressman Bill Zeliff, (R-N.H.) and Bill McCollum (R.-Fla.) started off like a house afire, despite roadblocks quickly thrown up by Congressman Charles Schumer, (D-N.Y.) former chairman of the committee, and his sidekick, Congressman John Conyers (D-Mich.) Schumer, known on Capitol Hill as “the Congressman from the Anti-Defamation League” accused Zeliff and McCollum of “trying to rehabilitate David Koresh”, provoking them into vilifying the departed minister at every opportunity. It seemed that Koresh would be totally destroyed when the committee brought in a witness, a 14-year-old girl named Kiri Jewell, who read a carefully prepared statement that David Koresh had had intercourse with her four years ago, when she was at the church. She was then ten years old. There was no cross examination, but all of the members of the committee, both Republican and Democratic, now erupted in furious vilification of David Koresh. Throughout the remainder of the hearings, they referred to him as “the maniacal child molester” and other epithets. However, a distinguished British renorter now based in Washington, Ambrose"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Evans-Pritchard, made a few phone calls that evening, and quickly elicited the information that at the time she claimed to have been molested, she had been living with her mother and grandmother in California, and had not been near Koresh or the church at Waco. However, Evans-Pritchard’s request to bring this information before the committee was indignantly denied by the chair. A CHANGE OF HEART After several days of hearings, the Republicans on the committee seemed to have experienced a remarkable change of heart. They repeatedly voiced their assurances that they were not there to attack law enforcement; they continued to vilify Koresh, and they allowed the Democrats, Schumer and Conyers to dictate the content of the hearings. This seemed very mysterious at the time, but Washington sources intimated that the Republican co-chairmen had received a good talking to from the ADL emissaries, who reminded them that these hearings might well result in the abolition of the ATF bureau, the abolition of the FBI, and the departure of Reno and Freeh, as had already been repeatedly predicted by the press. The ADL reminded the Republicans that Congress needed these federal agencies, who helped to maintain the monolithic government bureaucracy, and that the Congressmen too benefitted from their forays against the taxpaying citizens. The Republicans returned to the hearings, suitably admonished, and for the week of hearings remaining, their comments were indistinguishable from the Democrats. The sellout had been complete. A SURVIVOR SPEAKS One of the most effective witnesses at the Waco Hearings was a survivor of the Waco Holocaust, Clive Doyle, whose family had perished in the inferno. Doyle began his testimony by asking plaintively, “Why aren’t you calling more of the survivors? I know there are several of them in the area.” No one on the committee made any response, nor did they call any other survivors. However, they did call an incredible number of ATF agents and FBI agents who had presided over the Holocaust, and who repetitively claimed that they had incurred no blame for anything that happened. Doyle’s touching testimony began with his account of the initial ATF assault, when Koresh and his assistant were fired upon through the door by the ATF agents. Neither he nor any member of the committee ever referred to the damning article in Newsweek , April 5, 1993, which stated unequivocally that federal officials knew the agents had been killed in their own cross fire. Nor did they refer to another damning exposé, appearing in Time magazine, Dec. 11, 1993, headlined “TRIPPED UP BY LIES”, which stated, “A report paints a devastating portrait of ATF’s Waco planning. The two-hundred-and-twenty page critique issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms concluded that the decision to proceed was tragically wrong, not just in retrospect, but because of what the decision makers knew at the time. The report says they handled the sensitive situation ineptly, but tried to cover up its bungling with lies and obfuscations. Bentsen ordered replacement of the agency’s entire top management, including its director, Stephen Higgins.” THE WACO COVER UP"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Because Time , Newsweek and other publications had already fully exposed the blunders of government agents at Waco, we can only marvel at the duplicity of the Congressmen in concealing all of this readily available information and admitting only testimony which reinforced the government agents’ chutzpah in claiming they were totally blameless for the massacre of the women and children in their church. Throughout many days of parading the death squads’ members before their committee, the Congressmen vied with each other in expressing their thanks to the child killers for their selfless devotion to duty, their sacrifice, and their UNDISPUTED patriotism. TEXAS RANGERS The only break in this web of deceit, which ranks as one of the greatest acts of treachery by Congressmen in the history of our Republic, came when two bold and honest Texas Rangers testified before the committee. When they were asked why they had not spoken in public before on their experiences at Waco, they answered with great pride, “Texas Rangers do not give interviews, appear on talk shows, or make public statements.” Captain David Bymes and Captain Maurice Cook testified that they had been called to Waco and deputized as United States marshals in order to investigate the deaths of the ATF agents, which the government claimed was murder. However, they were horrified to find that FBI agents were changing and destroying evidence at the crime scene, a felony, and that they were conspiring to obstruct justice. When the agents realized that the Rangers had no intention of joining them in their conspiracy, they gave them the silent treatment. The Rangers testified that the FBI became totally uncooperative giving them very little input into what was going on at Waco and finally refusing to have any communication with the Rangers at all. Byrnes testified that the activities of the FBI at Waco “casts doubt on all law enforcement”. This was in complete contrast to the protestations of the Congressmen at this hearing that they were not there to attack law enforcement. Byrnes testified that he had called for the indictment and prosecution of two FBI agents who had repeatedly lied to him and obstructed his investigation of a murder scene. He said flatly, “We were lied to.” Although he insisted that he would continue his demands for prosecution of the FBI agents, it is doubtful that his complaints will ever be processed in Washington. Byrnes also testified that at Waco, “The FBI lines were always open to Washington. Everything was run out of Washington.” This clearly proved that President Clinton was in total charge of the entire Waco operation, as the FBI and the Attorney General are known as the KGB or political police of the White House. Nevertheless, no attempt was made by the chairmen of the Waco Hearings to call Clinton as a witness. RENO’S REVENGE The Waco cover-up hearings concluded with two days of testimony by Attorney General Janet Reno. She parried all queries about the torture and murder of the children at the church by gas and flames, stating that she had consulted the best experts. She pointed out that there was little available information about testing tear gas on children. In fact, the gas had been developed to control dangerous criminals. No one ever expected that it would be used on helpless infants. A psychologist observing her testimony commented that “Reno is"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"a classical, textbook example of the socio-psychopath. She is incapable of remorse or of admitting guilt for any crime she commits.” THE FINAL DISGRACE With each day of the hearings, Co-chairrnen Zeliff and McCollum had become more obsequious and fawning to the federal agents, the mass murderers, who appeared before them. Instead of reproaching them for their crimes, the Republican Congressmen outdid each other in grovelling before the killers, assuring them that in no way did they wish to reproach them for having done such an outstanding job. When Reno finally left the stand, and the cover-up hearings came to a close, Americans knew that they had been hornswoggled again. The Wall Street Journal , August 2, 1993, echoed the sentiments of most Americans when its editors criticized the hearings as featuring “far too much feeble, half-hearted questioning by Republicans. Enough new information has come out to make mincemeat of the Clinton Administration’s Waco story. Within forty-eight hours after the Feb. 28, 1993 initial assault on the Branch Davidian compound, the federal government abandoned routine law enforcement to avoid gathering evidence that might embarrass the government. A Sept. 17, 1993 Treasury Dept. confidential memo to Asst. Treas. Secretary Ronald Noble stated that on March 1, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms initiated a shooting review and ‘immediately determined that these stories (of agents involved) did not add up’. Justice Dept. Attorney Bill Johnston at this point advised ATF supervisor Dan Hartnett to stop the shooting review because AFT was creating exculpatory material that might undermine government prosecution of the Davidians. The cover-up continued on April 14, 1993. The Treasury Dept. general counsel, Robert McNamara, sent a letter to several top-ranking Treasury officials stating that the Justice Dept. ‘does not want Treasury to conduct any interviews or have discussions with any of the participants who may be witnesses because of fear of creating exculpatory material.’ The Justice Dept. also warned Treasury not to contract outside experts to analyze the original raid.” In conclusion, the Wall Street Journal found that “The evidence of a cover-up and gross federal misconduct is far stronger in the Waco hearings than in the Whitewater investigation. The Republican leadership in Congress should seize upon the recent revelations to demand a special counsel to be appointed to investigate possible federal crimes and cover-ups regarding Waco.” In fact, the Republican leadership in Congress has no intention of demanding a special counsel. Instead, they have now buried the Waco hearings forever, and will continue with the Whitewater charade, which actually serves to insulate Clinton from any investigation of his complicity in the Waco Holocaust, because the Whitewater hearings can be dismissed as a mere political harassment of the President. Once again the American people have been sold down the river by their duly elected representatives in Congress. The Waco cover-up will be seen by future historians as the most disgraceful act of a conspiratorial, totally degenerate Congress. It would seem that the children of Waco have now been buried for all time. Let us hope that an aroused American populace will soon raise as their battle cry, “Avenge the children of Waco!” ************************************************"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 08.) Anatomy Of A Lawsuit 09/25/95 The only person who has ever dared to sue the dread Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, Eustace Mullins, had his lawsuit dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals, August 1, 1995, during the court’s annual recess from June 4 to September 8, 1995. This case covered an odyssey of five years. Mullins had been invited by a patriotic group, Freedom Forum, to address a meeting at the Greek Orthodox Church on Cape Cod in June of 1990. The Anti-Defamation League organized a hate campaign to prevent the meeting from taking place, placing feature articles in the Cape Cod Times that Mullins was “a vicious anti-Semite”, organizing a phone-in campaign, and demanding that the priest refuse to allow the meeting to take place. The priest refused, stating that he had given his word to the group. Callers then threatened to “blow up the church and everybody in it” if Mullins spoke there. The priest reluctantly cancelled the meeting. This was the outstanding hate crime of 1990. Although the FBI, state and local police and other authorities were notified, to this day there has never been any investigation of the hate crime. The priest was hastily retired, and church officials now deny that the incident, fully reported in the press, ever occurred. The Cape Cod Times is owned by the giant media conglomerate, Dow-Jones Corp., which publishes the world’s largest newspaper, the Wall Street Journal . Mullins sued Dow-Jones in Virginia. The federal judge claimed “no jurisdiction” and at Mullins’ request, transferred the case to federal court in Boston, Mass. Judge Dave Mazzone promptly dismissed the lawsuit, accepting Dow-Jones’ claim that it had no responsibility for anything published in any newspaper it owned. Mullins refiled against Cape Cod Times . Mazzone quickly dismissed this lawsuit “with prejudice”, meaning it could never be refiled. On December 7, 1993, Mullins filed a one-hundred-million-dollar lawsuit against the ADL in Washington, D.C. federal court. The ADL attorneys, Washington power law firm Arent and Fox, failed to make a timely answer and went into default for $100,000,000.00. Judge Harold Herman Greene of U.S. District Court gave a special allowance to file a late reply. In their answer the ADL attorneys failed to deny any charges brought by Mullins, thus admitting all allegations stated in the lawsuit. Instead of answering, the ADL attorneys filed a lengthy Motion to Dismiss. Mullins then filed his usual Request to Amend Complaint, which is routinely granted by any court. It is an essential part of legal practice, as it gives lawyers more opportunity to run up horrendous bills against their unfortunate clients. Months passed, but Judge Greene made no answer to Mullins’ Request to Amend Complaint. On May 24, 1994, he stunned Mullins by suddenly dismissing the suit against the ADL with prejudice , meaning that it could never be refiled. Judge Greene had granted the ADL permanent immunity from Mullins’ lawsuit, which had charged the ADL with"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"illegal surveillance of his personal life for almost fifty years, in violation of many statutes prohibiting such criminal activity against American citizens. Judge Greene was world famous as the judge who single-handedly broke up the world’s largest corporation, the giant AT & T Co. He was extremely secretive and had given only one interview in his entire public career. Mullins discovered that he had been born in Germany as Heinz Grunhaus. In 1939, his family was allowed to leave Germany, implying that they were a favored Jewish family by the Nazis, like Max Warburg, the banker who had financed the Nazi movement and who was also allowed to come to the U.S. in 1939. Greene then went into the U.S. Army intelligence, serving in Germany with Henry Kissinger. He was recruited into the Sonnenfeldt-Kissinger Axis, a cabal of German Jews who soon infiltrated the federal government on behalf of the Rockefellers and their German partners, the notorious I.G. Farben chemical monopoly. In Washington, they replaced the Harold Ware cell, an espionage group run by Felix Frankfurter, Supreme Court Justice, which had to go underground because of the exposure of Alger Hiss. Greene was placed in the Justice Department where he moved up rapidly. Working closely with officials of the Anti-Defamation League, he set up a new department, the Civil Rights Division. He also produced legislation drafted by the ADL, including the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act passed by Congress. Current Biography quotes a Justice Department official: “Harold either wrote, reviewed, argued or participated in every significant civil rights case heard in the most crucial era of civil rights litigation. He had more to do with the writing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than anyone else.” Greene was rewarded for his key role in President Johnson’s civil rights revolution by being named chief superior court judge in the District of Columbia. He was given many important political cases, as presiding judge in the trial of Nixon’s aides in the early Watergate hearings. He ruled in favor of the ADL in the landmark case against the Hanafi Muslims, who had invaded the offices of the ADL to make a political point. There was no violence, but Greene revoked the bail of the Hanafi Muslims, turning Washington’s black community against him. Mullins had demanded a jury trial, a jury which would have been drawn from Washington’s black community where the ADL was heartily despised because of its manipulation of “house niggers” such as Jesse Jackson. Mullins’ appeal with the U.S. District Court of Appeals, states that Greene’s dismissal of his suit against the ADL with prejudice is in error because there was no discovery, no pleading, and no proof; that Judge Greene erred in refusing his Motion to Amend Complaint; and that Judge Green erred in allowing the case to proceed after the ADL had gone into default. The appeal states that the ADL’s criminal activities were funded for many years by the two Godfathers of the National Crime Syndicate, Moe Dalitz and Meyer Lansky, who received public recognition by the ADL for their financial support. Moe Dalitz, the inspiration for The Godfather movie, died in his home in Las Vegas at the age of eighty-nine, after a criminal career spanning more than seventy-five years. His obituary in the New York Times hailed him as a philanthropist, ignoring the hundreds of murders committed by Dalitz and his partner, Lansky, to rid themselves of competition in gangland."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Times proudly pointed out that during his seventy-five year career of crime, Dalitz had never been convicted. This explains the ADL determination to control all judicial appointments in the United States. Meyer Lansky’s biographer, Hank Messick, stated that by 1965, Lansky had amassed a three-hundred-million-dollar fortune. A prominent Washington physician noted the ADL crime connection in addressing the Schiller Club at Howard University, September 16, 1992, “The Anti-Defamation League wants to lynch black people. They’re [your “friends”] only if you are a pagan, an ignorant person, but not if you are truly a Jew, a Christian or a Muslim.” Dr. Mohammed is one of the most respected physicians in Washington, a fact recognized by the mayor, Sharon Pratt Lekky, when she proclaimed July 11, 1992 as “Abdul Alim Mohammed Day”. The New Federalist newspaper in Washington, D.C. headlined the following: “WASHINGTON PRESS CONFERENCE DENOUNCES THE ANTIDEFAMATION LEAGUE AS GANGSTERS”. The Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, notorious for its defense of the international drug cartel and its smearing of its political enemies as “anti-Semites”, was denounced at a press conference here as having nothing to do with civil rights, but as being a gangster organization with political motives which should be treated as such. At the press conference, Dr. Mohammed rejected charges that he and the Nation of Islam are anti- Semitic, and said that the slanders emanate from the World Jewish Congress meeting in Brussels, Belgium. Lawrence Freeman outlined his history of the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL was founded in the early part of this century as a public relations front for the Jewish branch of organized criminals. Many of Meyer Lansky’s top lieutenants were always among the ADL’s biggest contributors. In 1985, the ADL gave its Torch of Liberty award to gangster Moe Dalitz, a big shot in the National Crime Syndicate and close ally of Meyer Lansky. The December 1978 historic special issue of The Campaigner , “Zionism is Not Judaism” states, “The B’Nai B’Rith was a British Intelligence unit dedicated to the destruction of the American Republic. It was an arm of British Intelligence with that chartered purpose at the time of its founding in 1843, and remains so to this day. The founder of B’Nai B’Rith was Henry Palmerston, then British Foreign Minister, who simultaneously created the international Zionist movement. In the period of 1843-1860, Zionism was only one of tens of cults created under Palmerston, some “Jewish”, some “Christian” in name, and spread across Europe and America as subversive arms of the British Empire. The academic intellectuals have found it easy to set up networks which reward each other, promote each others’ work, and magnify each others’ dubious activities. Each cult was modelled on the Ashmolean Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, of which Palmerston was Grand Master, itself modelled on Ptolemaic Egypt’s death cult of Isis. In early 1995, Bill Gates and his huge Microsoft empire had been challenged by Judge Stanley Sporkin whose office is a short distance from Judge Greene in the cavernous federal court building at Third and Constitution Ave. in Washington. Sporkin hoped to seize control of the Microsoft corporation as his rival Greene had done with AT & T. Bill Gates fought back, and the Appeals Court scheduled oral arguments. They soon gave a decision in favor of Microsoft and permanently removed Sporkin from the case. Because Mullins had filed with the same court a year earlier, it seemed likely that he too would soon"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"be called. However on July 20 he received an order from the U. S. Court of Appeals that there would be no oral argument in his case. He had previously inquired at the Appeals Court to see when his case was coming up after more than a year had passed and was informed that the court was in recess from June 4 to September 8. A few days later, he received a Judgment from the court affirming Greene’s dismissing of his suit against the ADL. This was filed August 1, 1995. There was no explanation as to how this had been arranged while the court was in summer recess. It seems likely that it was one of the famous “law clerk decisions” for which federal courts, including the Supreme Court, are famous in Washington, in which the judges merely initial a finding issued by the clerks. Mullins was then informed by the ADL law firm that he was liable for enormous costs after losing his appeal. Mullins promptly filed a Motion to Set Aside the Judgment, pointing out that the ADL, a tax-exempt corporation funded by secret contributors to carry on its criminal activities as an unregistered agent of the State of Israel, had no standing to defend in court, because of its close association with the Mafia and Mossad. ( Black’s Law Dictionary : standing_to be such capacity to be a defendant in this action_Reputatio est vulgaris opinio ubi non est veritas.) He pointed out that the Judgment affirmed that there was no legal redress for the well-documented crimes committed against him for almost fifty years by the ADL, including religious persecution, genocide, and conspiracy to deny his civil rights. “The continuous and ongoing nature of this conspiracy renders moot the district court’s attempt to separate individual acts of these crimes from the ongoing conspiracy of the Anti- Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, in order to make the claim that these separate crimes are time-barred.” Mullins’ Motion also criticized the peculiar assignment of this case, a Christian defending himself against a vendetta by the ADL as a Jewish campaign, to a Jew from Germany, whose associations with the ADL were a matter of record. Mullins also noted that while the appeal was before the U.S. Court of Appeals, the ADL launched a nationwide propaganda campaign against Mullins in order to influence the appellate judges against him. ADL- placed stories in the New York Times , the New Yorker , Nation , New Republic and many other nationally circulated publications denounced Mullins as “a vicious anti-Semitic fascist”. If the U.S. Court of Appeals refuses to set aside its Judgment, Mullins remains liable for the costs to Arent and Fox, the ADL law firm. An appeal to the Supreme Court is the next step, but the Supreme Court rarely hears any case for damages. ***** IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS For the District of Columbia Circuit No. 94-7116 Eustace C. Mullins, Appellant"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"v. Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT Appellant, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as Attorney Pro Propria Persona, respectfully moves this Court to set aside its Judgment in this action, for the following reasons: 1. The appellee, the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, has no standing to defend in this action before this Court. It is a tax-exempt corporation which is funded by secret contributors to carry on its criminal activities against Eustace Mullins and other Americans throughout the United States as the illegal and unregistered representative of a foreign state, the State of Israel, functioning as a state within a state, committing crimes against American citizens without fear of reprisal, in close association with other criminal gangs such as the Mafia and Mossad, a terrorist group operating as Israeli Intelligence. ( Black’s Law Dictionary : standing_to be such capacity to be a defendant in this action. Reputatio est vulgaris opinio ubi non est veritas .) 2. The Judgment of this Court affirms that there is no legal redress for the well-documented crimes committed against the person of Eustace Mullins over a period of many years, by the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, including religious persecution, genocide, and conspiracy to deny civil rights. The continuous and ongoing nature of this conspiracy renders moot the district court’s attempt to separate individual acts of these crimes from the on-going conspiracy of the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith in order to make the claim that these separate crimes are time-barred. A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. The conspiracy itself is a separate crime, and no part of the conspiracy can be separated and labelled as “time-barred”. 3. The assignment of this case in the United States District Court was, to say the least, peculiar. A sensitive action involving a citizen of the Christian faith defending himself against a world-wide vendetta against Christians conducted by the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith as a Jewish campaign, was assigned to a judge who may have been overly aware of his Jewish commitment. Formerly known as Heinz Grunhaus of Germany, he was said to have lost most of his relatives in the Holocaust, and to have recurrent nightmares of millions of Jewish corpses stacked up like cordwood. Conflicting stories pointed out that the Grunhauses were allowed to leave Germany for the United States at the onset of the Second World War as a family given favored treatment by the Nazis, like the banker Max Warburg, who had financed the Nazi movement in Germany. 4. In Washington, Grunhaus was drawn into the Sonnenfeldt-Kissinger Axis, a cabal of German Jews which infiltrated the federal government and operated it for the benefit of the Rockefeller interests in partnership with I.G. Farben chemical combine, after its predecessor, Felix Frankfurther’s notorious Harold Ware cell, had to go underground because of the Alger Hiss exposures. Grunhaus was placed in the Justice Department, where he advanced rapidly. Working closely with Anti-Defamation League interests, he"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"established the new Civil Rights Division and drafted such important ADL legislation as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. He was then moved to Superior Court in the District of Columbia, where he openly ruled in favor of the Anti-Defamation League in the famous ADL-Hanafi Muslim case, which turned Washington’s black community against him. The ADL then lobbied President Carter to move him to the U.S. District Court. When Mullins’ lawsuit was filed before this court, he requested a jury hearing of this action, which would have been impaneled from the Washington community. Before this could take place, the case was hastily dismissed with prejudice and could never be filed against the Anti-Defamation League again. There was no discovery allowed, no hearings, and no jury hearing. 5. It was well known that the Anti-Defamation League had long considered Eustace Mullins a primary target in its nationwide war against Christianity in the United States. In 1993, the ADL published The Religious Right: The Assault on Tolerance and Pluralism in America , a book which, according to Larry Witham of the Washington Times , “Charges members of the ‘religious right’ with anti-Semitism, Christian ‘triumphalism’, Nazi sympathies and denials of the Holocaust.” The ADL intensified a national campaign against Eustace Mullins on the same charges. Ralph Reed, head of the Christian Coalition, described the ADL book as “filled with errors, half-truths, and outright lies designed to stereotype Christians and other people of faith.” Pat Buchanan, in his column, defined the ADL assault as “Christian-bashing”. The Anti-Defamation League assaults against Eustace Mullins stemmed from its activities as publicist for the Cult of Baal, a Canaanite group which promoted sexual degeneracy and abuse of children. During His Ministry on Earth, Jesus Christ had preached against the Cult of Baal. All of Eustace Mullins’ writing and lecturing is carried on under the auspices of the O.T.U. Christ Church. In 1968, his autobiography, My Life in Christ was published by Faith and Service Books. His Christian work is the sole basis for all the ADL enunciation of him as a “vicious anti-Semite”, constituting a flagrant case of religious persecution. 6. When the district court dismissed Mullins’ lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, Mullins filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. In a campaign to bring undue influence to bear on the judges of this court, the Anti-Defamation League launched a national smear campaign against Mullins through the Zulzberger- Newhouse Axis, featuring assaults on him as a “vicious anti-Semite” in national publications including the New York Times , the New Yorker , Nation , the New Republic , and other publications responsive to ADL influence. This campaign was designed solely to sway the deliberations of this court, and is described in detail in Mullins’ forthcoming book, The Anatomy of a Lawsuit . Virginia’s largest newspaper, the Richmond Times- Dispatch in a lengthy feature article May 10, 1995, stated, “Mullins has been tracked for years by the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, which labels him a Holocaust denier and anti-Semitic fascist.” Their authority was Samuel Kaplan of the Virginia-North Carolina office of the Anti-Defamation League, who wrote in Virginia’s second largest newspaper, Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, May 18, 1995 another lengthy diatribe against Mullins for his Christian affiliations. It is noteworthy that while this action was in litigation, the ADL continued an intensive nationwide campaign against Mullins in order to influence the court. The virulence of the religious hatred of the ADL thugs against Mullins also surfaced"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"in the ADL-directed massacres of the Weavers, a Christian family in Idaho, and the Waco Holocaust, in which ADL-directed FBI jackbooted thugs exterminated an entire Christian congregation in their church, using tanks and helicopters in the worst religious massacre in American history. The Waco Holocaust also was a trial run for Plan Naamah, a plot to exterminate all Christians in the United States after their guns have been confiscated by government decree. Plan Naamah was exposed in Mullins’ books, The Curse of Canaan and The World Order . Wherefore, appellant, Eustace C. Mullins moves the Court to set aside its Judgment and allow this action to be litigated with due process and equal protection of the laws. By /s/ Eustace C. Mullins /s/ Eustace C.

Editor’s note: This is the biggest dynamite breakthrough story by Eustace Mullins since his exposé of the secret history of the Federal Reserve System. It will rock the boats of both political and financial communities. Criminal Politics magazine is pleased to provide the first time exposé of the strange, double identity of a major federal judge who calls himself Harold Greene. It is also a financial news breakthrough. After all -- who really controls AT&T?? ] FALSE IDs USED TO GAIN CONTROL OF MANY HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES Who is this alien who has GAINED CONTROL of the INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY? The financial press is filled with daily stories of exciting speculation about the development of [the] Information Superhighway. The editors of Forbes , Businessweek ,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Fortune and The Wall Street Journal are well aware of the facts you will read here for the first time. None the less, only CRIMINAL POLITICS magazine, would dare bring you the incredible -- almost unbelievable story behind the alien who carries a false I.D. -- who has seized control of our entire telecommunications industry. Meanwhile Congress cowers in fear -- not daring to criticize him because of the enormous sinister power behind him. The power of World Zionism which will soon rule the world. Who is this alien? Who is this monster from the darkest cabalistic mythology of Zionist history? Who has such Power that he wields an absolute dictatorship over our communications industry? Who dominates this most important aspect of American life for the satraps of an invisible empire? No one knows! He goes by the name of Judge Harold Greene and wears the black robes of a powerful federal judge. Harold H. Greene is the Federal judge for the United States District Court in Washington D.C., the most POWERFUL JUDICIAL OFFICE IN THE UNITED STATES. NO CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT! Two of the most powerful men in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, a frequent candidate of the Republican party for President, and Congressman John Dingell, a man of such power that no one in Washington dares to criticize him, introduced bills to curb and revoke the unconstitutional powers of Judge Harold Greene. In recent years both of their bills died without a trace in Congress. No one on Capitol Hill dared to support these bills which merely required that Judge Greene return his illegally usurped power to the Federal Communication Commission -- where they rightfully belong. Why could no Congressman support a bill to curb this unaccountable authority? Because they fear the World Power, which he represents -- the feared power of World Zionism. The most powerful lobbying group on Capitol Hill happens to be the American-Israeli Political Action Committee (AIPAC). They also fear the national media controlled by an enforcement arm of World Zionism, the World Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League, B’nai B’rith. THE FATAL TRANSFER OF POWER A brief review: The Carter Justice Department sued AT&T under the Sherman Anti-trust Act (an act seldom used by most administrations and completely ignored by both Reagan and Bush). The settlement was reached by AT&T and the Justice Department, and a routine approval was expected from the Federal Courts, which would never dare delve into such complicated matters. After years of negotiation between the parties, after years to gain public, Congressional and industry input, you would think it would be a final settlement. Greene, however, refused to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"accept the settlement. He made the unprecedented demand that he RETAIN permanent authority over the implementation of the agreement AND telecommunications business. A COUP D’ETAT OF INCREDIBLE PROPORTIONS! This was clearly a COUP d’etat, never before seen in American business. No Federal judge has the right to demand permanent control of any single company -- none-the-less an entire industry. In spite of this amazing and unchallenged usurpation of the power of the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the rights of stockholders involved, no one challenged this single judge. How can this be explained? We think the explanation is in the previous paragraphs. People in the beltway were very much aware of the history of this judge and WHO he is. AN ALIEN TAKES OVER AMERICAN INDUSTRY! Greene demanded and received the right to review most new AT&T ventures and ANY acquisitions are under his exclusive domain. Expansion into mobile telephone business, for example, could not be accomplished unless he decided to allow it (so far refused). Under the breakup agreement, which he imposed by his own power and authority on the telecommunications industry, he personally, in his own independent decision, without consulting anyone, must approve the entry of all Baby Bell Companies into new businesses! NO PERSON IN AMERICA HAS SIMILAR POWER No other single person in America has any power remotely reaching that of Judge Greene, over such a major industry. None-the-less, on January 1, 1984, the divestiture of the Baby Bells by AT&T took affect. Greene however, could not wait for 1-1-84, and began issuing tough rulings which had a huge impact on the stockholders of AT&T, as well as the customers. AT&T has 2.4 million shareholders and many millions more customers. That this single person should impact with unprecedented and illegal authority, must finally be disclosed to the American public. After all, AT&T is the most widely held stock in the United States, and is considered the ideal in classic investment for widows and orphans. Here we have an alien who has usurped authority and control of the dividends which blank (sic) Americans receive each year. RULES TO LIVE BY ISSUED IN JULY ‘84 After demanding ten modifications to the split-up agreement Greene issued rules of operations for the entire Telecommunications Industry. His court “waivers” must be obtained for the regional bell companies to enter new businesses. The permissions must be granted before the act, thus negotiations by a Bell Company to acquire any other firm were public knowledge before the negotiations were even beginning. Only one Bell Company, U.S. West, went to court in the U.S. Court of Appeals,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"challenging Greene’s authority. U.S. West said that Greene had no right to set conditions on regional Bells because they were not parties to the split up agreement and were not even in existence at the time of the entry of the decree. Naturally, the U.S. Appeals court bowed to this alien judge, who has been utilizing a false identity since the mid-1940s.  F.C.C. DEFUNCT UNDER ZIONIST DECREES The Federal Communications Commission is supposed to regulate the telecommunications industry. Judge Greene has been able to overstep the Executive branch of government and declare VOID the regulatory authority of the FCC without a whimper from Congress, and without any whiplash from the industry, the shareholders or the Congress of the United States. There isn’t a SHRED of judicial precedent for any federal judge being able to overstep his authority in an uncontrollable way. Greene has stated that he considers the FCC totally incapable of regulating the world of telecommunications. This opinion is very interesting, but what weight should it have?? In reality it has no weight what-so-ever. The FCC has never relinquished control of the industry, and has complete legal authority to order that Greene step down immediately and that it begin its proper, congressionally mandated regulation of the telecommunications business. Greene’s rulings since 1985, are all illegal, and we challenge anyone to contradict Criminal Politics magazine’s opinion on this point (A copy of this report will be sent directly to Judge Greene’s office for his commentary or response). AN ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PROCESS Congressman John Dingell, the powerful chairman of the house Energy and Commerce Committee, once whimpered quietly (although he was quoted) that he was “offended by the anti-democratic process whereby a SINGLE, UNELECTED AND UNACCOUNTABLE FEDERAL JUDGE has been able to transform himself into a regulatory department without portfolio.” An example of a Greene decision: BABY BELLS CAN’T ENTER RETAILING -- AN ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PROCESS Whether right or wrong we render no opinion, but for a SINGLE individual to control who may enter retailing in the United States is simply absurd. Greene had issued a decision in 1987, that blocks the regional Bells from moving into telephone equipment manufacturing and television shopping programs and services! As a result, we now have the Home Shopping Network (HSN), and several billions of dollars of merchandise are now sold by this company and revenue has been denied to the shareholders of the regional Bells. Should ONE MAN make such a decision?? Obviously not! At the very least, he should be willing to serve as an advisor or consultant to the FCC rather than the “god” of the telecommunications industry."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" SOooo... WHO IS HAROLD GREEN? In 1939, on the eve of WWII, a young man and his family were allowed to leave Germany. No one seems to know WHY. This young man, one Heinz Grunhaus, and his relatives went to Belgium for a few months, and then on to Spain. This was the traditional point of embarkation for persons wishing to travel to the United States. During the height of the Second World War, they somehow made their way from Spain to the U.S. in 1943. However, a black shroud of secrecy has been drawn over the entire history of the Grunhaus family by none other than Judge Grunhaus (Greene) himself. There is not a single investigative journalist among the 35,000 well paid reporters in Washington, who would DARE to begin an investigation into his strange background. The retribution would be swift. That reporter would never write another story in Washington. BACKGROUND DENIED Of the hundreds of meager stories checked out by this writer over a period of months of painstaking investigation, I have found only one -- (ONE) -- brief story in Time magazine January 2, 1984, page 53, which gave his proper birth name of Heinz Grunhaus. He has the shortest listing in Who’s Who In America of any major figure. A few brief lines identify him as a Federal Judge in D.C.; there is no place of birth, no parents’ names, no date of entry into the U.S., no wife’s name, no children’s names, or any of the standard biographical material which Marquis Who’s Who requires for listing in the books of record. Marquis Who’s Who usually refuses to list anyone who does not provide such information. Typically entries in Who’s Who , one of this writer’s most valuable sources, gives several paragraphs of information. Some of them take more than a half a page of accomplishments, memberships, religious affiliations and other routine information that it is necessary to understand what one’s background is and what they might think or do in a position of power. No one is allowed this information about Grunhaus. A CAMOUFLAGED, DOUBLE IDENTITY ZIONIST DICTATOR After uncovering this lack of early history, I contacted some of the most knowledgeable persons in Washington about my findings. One of them actually maintained a file on Grunhaus for a number of years. I asked him, “Do you know his birth name?” “Of course,” he said, “It’s Harold Greene.” I then informed him that Greene was born Heinz Grunhaus. He was astonished when I informed him that Grunhaus had actually been born in Germany and that he had immigrated to the U.S. during the most crucial months of WW II. I have yet to find anyone in Washington who is aware of his background. THE KISSINGER CONNECTION Arriving in the U.S. at the age of 22, Grunhaus (Greene) immediately went into the U.S. Army. In 1945, he turned up in his native country -- Germany -- as a staff sergeant in the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"U.S. Army INTELLIGENCE working with A COMPATRIOT -- NONE OTHER THAN A REFUGEE WHO FOLLOWED THE SAME PATHWAY BY THE NAME OF HENRY (HEINZ) KISSINGER!! With apparent ease, these two German Zionist refugees went into the most sensitive area of the entire U.S. military forces -- our intelligence service. Prior to 1940, only soldiers with well established credentials as loyal NATIVE BORN AMERICANS were allowed to serve in the Intelligence Service of our military forces. Somehow that was all changed. A defeated Germany was now inundated by a hoard of former Jewish citizens (Grunhaus and Kissinger among them) who had total authority granted them by the armed forces, and sought to wreak Zionist revenge upon a prostrate German nation. They were not there as peaceful occupiers, they went on a mission of hate vengeance and they exercised total and unanswerable authority over their victims. THE PARALLEL OF HENRY KISSINGER It is well known that Henry Kissinger, while serving as a sergeant in the U.S. Army intelligence in captive Germany, was recruited by the KGB as a secret agent who used the code name “BOR” (see HENRY KISSINGER SOVIET AGENT published by Criminal Politics book Club for $10.00 plus $1.50 postage and handling). Was his compatriot in Army Intelligence (Heinz Grunhaus) also recruited by the KGB? This is a question of crucial importance to every American. It has special relevance in light of the ascension to the position of communication CZAR by Grunhaus. GRUNHAUS WROTE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTS! Quite amazingly, after returning from Germany, where he married a girl from the Saar, Grunhaus changed his name to Greene and was somehow hired by the Department of Justice as a translator. He attended night school at George Washington University, as had so many bureaucrats before him, including J. Edgar Hoover. In 1949, he received his degree and a law degree in 1952. Throughout the period he continued to work at the Department of Justice. In 1957, a new division of the Justice was created -- THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION. Greene was immediately named Chief of the Research and Appeals division, with total authority of all appeals in the Civil Rights cases. An unnamed Justice Department official contributed to the CURRENT BIOGRAPHY as follows: “Harold either wrote, reviewed, argued or participated in every significant Civil Rights case heard in the most crucial era of Civil Rights litigation. He had more to do with the writing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, than any other person. DISRUPTION OF AMERICAN LIFE What does this mean? It means that Grunhaus was responsible (as an alien) for creating the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"most brutal and oppressive legislation masquerading as “Civil Rights Laws” than anyone else in our history. Federal agents were given total authority over the most private aspects of the personal and business lives of NATIVE BORN Americans under this group of laws. They were told who they could hire...who they could rent or sell their homes to...affecting every vestige of the daily lives of free-born Americans. All of this under the supervision of the fertile brain of the recent arrival from Germany, Heinz Grunhaus -- all accidental of course! As an additional payoff for his Civil Rights work, Lyndon B. Johnson named Grunhaus to the bench in the District of Columbia in 1965. The following year, Johnson again promoted him to Chief Judge of the Superior Court. On May 17, 1978, President Jimmy Carter named Grunhaus Federal Judge for the U.S. Court in Washington. Grunhaus is one of 300 judges named to the Federal bench by the peanut dealer, Carter. None have power over American life even approaching that of Grunhaus. AT&T CASE TRANSFERRED, BUT BY WHOM? The Current Biography states that “within days Greene inherited the AT&T case.” This is not accurate. For four years, the AT&T case had been presided over by a highly respected black judge -- Joseph C. Waddy. Someone -- somewhere -- decided that Judge Waddy was inadequate for this job, and immediately upon Grunhaus’ taking his place as a Federal judge in Washington D.C., he was assigned the case. It is unprecedented for a transfer of a case to take place without illness or some other special situation intervening, such as illness or scandal. At that time AT&T was the largest corporation in the world with revenues of $59.2 billion, a sum larger than the entire income of most countries. A settlement was reached early on in the case, but as stated earlier, there was no final approval until August 11, 1982. How Greene’s extensive background in Civil Rights legislation and cases qualified him to become the sole arbiter of our communications services has never been explained or properly discussed by ANY MEDIA. HEADQUARTERS OF THE EMPIRE This writer has actually been in the office of Judge Harold Greene in the U.S. Court Building on Constitution Avenue in Washington. It is an ordinary three room office. But how does Grunhaus operate a vast empire from this small office?? With two clerks and a secretary? There obviously has to be more to this situation than meets the eye. I had gone into the office to request his financial statement. All U.S. Attorneys and Federal Judges are required by law to furnish financial statements to any citizen on request. I did NOT get this financial statement! I was referred to several other offices which also failed to produce it. Apparently not everyone has to comply with the law. POSSIBLE ILLEGAL BENEFITS There are several aspects of illegal activity that could result from Grunhaus’ control of this industry: First of all his decisions could be known in advance to those he favors. Common"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"sense would dictate that a requirement would be in place that he be investigated, and that his compatriots and friendships be investigated for checking into possible violations of the insider trading laws and other ethical violations. After all, it has been determined by the Congress that insider trading is illegal, and that the Justice Department should RIGOROUSLY enforce unfair profiteering made by insiders and friends of insiders. Even common laborers, who operate printing presses for prospectus’ on new issues and mergers and acquisitions have been prosecuted and jailed for making a few thousand dollars from an “insider” stock trade. How many tens of millions of dollars have been made by friends of Heinz Grunhaus, who somehow became aware of his decisions in advance? This man has made decisions which have created tens of billions of dollars in new common stock evaluation over the 12 years since he gained control of the telecommunications industry. LEFT WING AT&T ACTIVITIES There is another interesting fact and that is the extreme leftward shift of AT&T management since the Grunhaus control. Other long distance carriers seem to have the same ultra liberal leftward bent. AT&T for example, has never sufficiently shown that it’s no longer profiting from the dial-a-porn business to teenagers on AT&T 1-900 numbers. SUPPORT FOR HOMOSEXUALITY What’s more, AT&T had financially supported the homosexual lifestyle through its “diversity recognition program”. This program equates gay pride week with Martin Luther King’s birthday, black history month, etc., etc. According to our sources, AT&T has approved the use of the AT&T name by the “AT&T League of Gay and Lesbian Employees”!!! Naturally no group of AT&T employees could get away with starting an organization called “AT&T League for Christian Employees”. AT&T requires all management to go through “affirmative action” training, which means that NO DISCRIMINATION of queers may be permitted in AT&T operations. AT&T provides support for the Sodomite lifestyle by providing videotapes, such as ON BEING GAY, PARENTS AND FRIENDS OF LESBIANS AND GAYS, and finally GAYS AND LESBIANS IN THE WORKPLACE. AT&T is a major corporate sponsor for the so-called “Gay Olympics” in New York City and makes tax deductible contributions to dozens of other ultra left wing organizations. Are they worried about customer backlash? If so, there is no sign of it. SPRINT AND MCI What about the other long distance carriers? Sprint is a carrier for a service called “Working Assets”. This group boasts of subsidizing groups like the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU with total contributions of more"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"than $2,000,000. MCI has joined Sprint and AT&T in supporting, with their advertising dollars, anti-Christian and homosexual propaganda that overflows into America’s homes every day. ************************************************ 10.)

The Rabin assassination is the symbolic homage to his terrorist career, as his mirror image, youthful killer Amir, was chosen to carry out this murder. In Current Biography , 1974, we read that Rabin, at the age of nineteen, had become a key murderer in Palmach, the “action squad” of Haganah, the Zionist terrorist organization. Terrorism as we know it today is the deliberate creation of Haganah, the Zionist murder arm. No atrocity was too horrible for these dedicated fanatics in their crusade to create the Zionist World Empire. Rabin’s Palmach operation deliberately blew up entire shiploads of Jewish refugees throughout the 1940s when they were refused permission by British authorities to land in Palestine. In November 1940, Rabin’s terrorists blew up the refugee ship Patrio in Haifa harbor, killing hundreds of Jewish refugees. Rabin continued to carry out these atrocities, calmly explaining that these “sacrifices” were necessary in order to create a world climate of opinion supporting the “suffering Jews”, who were actually being murdered by their own leaders. Who today remembers the anti-Jewish riots in London throughout the 1940s? These riots were caused by public outcry against Zionist atrocities committed against youthful British occupation soldiers in Palestine. Rabin’s Palmach squads kidnapped teenaged British youths, tortured them for days, and murdered them. They then left the booby-trapped bodies hanging in the open. When their comrades attempted to give them Christian burial, they too were killed by the exploding corpses. During the Six Day War, the maniacal Rabin, commander of the Zionist forces, ordered the deliberate massacre of many thousands of helpless Egyptian soldiers who had surrendered. Only now are these atrocities coming to light. THE “PALESTINIAN REFUGEE PROBLEM”"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"This was created at Rabin’s order. By expelling more than a million Palestinians from their ancestral homes, many of them being massacred in the process, Rabin instituted the ongoing “refugee problem”. The survivors were huddled in camps under terrible conditions, but even there they were not safe from the Zionist terrorists. Rabin ordered systematic massacres of the refugees to be carried out in these camps, such as the notorious slaughters of the innocents in the Sabra and Shatila camps. When the refugees were provoked into resisting these horrors, Rabin issued orders that the arms and legs of the Arab children were to be broken. Reporters who covered these atrocities found that their stories could not be shown on American television, due to the personal intervention of Henry Kissinger, a director of CBS. If Yitzhak Rabin was Israel’s premier terrorist, why was he selected for killing by his people? It is difficult for any rational American to comprehend the fanaticism of the Zionist zealots. The front page of the Sunday New York Times November 12, 1995 features the headline: “Zeal of Rabin’s Assassin Springs from Rabbis of the Religious Right”. On the same day, the front page of the Washington Post featured a further explanation, “Amir mentioned that Rabin qualified for a 'din-rodef', the ‘judgment of the pursuer', entitling a righteous man to kill him, because Rabin was poised to spill the blood of other Jews by giving up control over the occupied West Bank.” Thus Rabin was a religious sacrifice, a victim of ritual murder, to fulfill the Armageddon Plan of the Zionist fanatics. Americans were not informed that more than half of the population of Israel greeted the news of Rabin’s killing with cheers, although we were told that the entire world “mourned” him. Israel is a theocracy, ruled by its rabbis. These rabbis met and passed a death sentence on Rabin, to halt his “peace program” of restraining the continued Jewish settlements on Arab lands. Rabin knew that he was to be executed, and he accepted it. His bodyguards allowed Amir to approach him and to kill him. Rabin’s murder officially launches a new Jihad or Holy War by Zionist fanatics to exterminate all Arabs still living in Palestine. This genocide in turn will launch World War III throughout the world. The religious right fundamentalism in the United States will push our country into this Holy War on the side of the Zionists, as religious leaders like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have preached for years. They are controlled by Zionist agit- prop leaders such as William Kristol, who also directs the “Republican Revolution” in Washington. Gingrich and Dole are Kristol’s political apparatchniks. Clinton has been ordered by these apparatchniks to send American troops into Bosnia as a key element of the Armageddon program. Both World Wars have been launched in this key area. During World War II, Hitler was poised to capture Moscow and triumphantly end the war. At the crucial moment, a Yugoslav outbreak forced him to divert a large portion of his armies from the Moscow attack. This turned the tide against him, resulting in his defeat. The American people must be informed of the sinister forces working against them. If we cannot respond in time, we are doomed to be exterminated in the Zionist-planned Armageddon of World War III, in which we will be forced to participate by the Zionist- controlled religious right and the Democrats and the Republicans, all of whom are totally directed by the Zionist activists. Americans, save yourselves!"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"************************************************ 11.) The Twilight Of The Gods 12/17/95 Is It Gotterdammerung for the United Nations? The recent 50th anniversary celebration of the United Nations seemed more like a wake. The largest group of world leaders ever assembled anywhere gathered in New York, one- hundred-and-seventy-nine assorted presidents, prime ministers and dictators smiled uneasily for the camera. The group photograph, to those with a knowledge of history, was eerily like the photographs of the crowned heads of Europe taken just before the outbreak of World War I, which would sweep most of them into oblivion. Only a few days after the taking of the UN anniversary photograph, one of its more illustrious attendees, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the State of Israel, was himself dispatched by bullets from a fellow Jewish extremist. It will be interesting to look back in the year 2000 and see how many of these persons of great power actually survived the twentieth century. Tlie New York United Nations assemblage had to forego the presence of its most famous creator. It was deemed inappropriate to summon him for the festivities, although he resided only a few blocks from the UN building. As a convicted perjurer who had been sent to prison for lying about his activities as an espionage agent for the USSR, Alger Hiss might have attracted unwelcome reminiscences about his checkered career. Hiss, one of three Communist agents who served as the late President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s personal advisors at the White House, is generally revered as the architect of the United Nations Conference in San Francisco in 1945 which brought the international conspiracy into being. During Hiss’ public trial, the media ignored his impressive connections with the subterranean forces of the World Order. He had been selected as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace by General Dwight Eisenhower, later elected President of the United States, and by John Foster Dulles, who became Eisenhower’s Secretary of State. Dulles had represented the House of Rothschild at a meeting with Adolf Hitler in Cologne, Germany in 1934 which guaranteed the bankrupt Hitler funds from the Bank of England to install his newly elected Nazi government. When Hiss was indicted by the U.S.A. Government, his lawyer, serving without pay, was Helen Lehman Buttenweiser, daughter of a Lehman Brothers banker, and married to a partner of Kuhn, Loeb Co. in New York, Benjamin Buttenweiser, whose partner Jacob Schiff boasted that he had spent more than twenty million dollars of his own funds to promote the Communist Revolution in Russia. Another Kuhn, Loeb partner, Paul Warburg, had secretly authored the Federal Reserve Act in 1910 at a conspiratorial meeting in Jekyll Island, Georgia, where the event is now marked by a small brass plaque at the Jekyll Island Hotel. Buttenweiser later became Assistant High Commissioner of a defeated Germany after World War II. During"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Hiss’ long trial, and throughout his prison sentence, his son, Tony, was an honored guest at the million dollar Buttenweiser mansion in the East Eighties. The fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations could hardly have come at a worse time, as the organization had reached the lowest ebb of its prestige. A war of “ethnic cleansing” has raged in the former nation of Yugoslavia for years, during which many thousands of people have been tortured and massacred, while many thousands of survivors have endured apocalyptic conditions during mass evictions, been forced into concentration camps, and faced all the horrors of war. Many of the victims have been women and children. The United Nations has had “peacekeeping forces” stationed in the war-torn area during much of these hostilities, but their presence has been the occasion for scorn. The Washington Post on October 26, 1995 noted that at the very time of the lavish United Nations festivities in New York, “the Dutch (U.N.) peacekeepers made little effort to defend the civilian population. They were worried about their own hostages. Refugees later described how many of the Dutch were forced at gunpoint to strip to their underwear by Bosnian Serb soldiers, who then strutted around in U.N. uniforms themselves”. One refugee was quoted about the sorry spectacle. “Hassan Nuhanovic, a 27-year-old translator, said he was permitted to remain in the compound because he was employed by the United Nations. ‘I don’t understand it. Nobody believed that the U.N. wouldn’t protect the people,’ said Nuhapovic, who has not seen any of his family members since their tearful farewell at the gate to the U.N. compound.” Now President Clinton has dispatched some 20,000 United States [troops] to the scenes of these massacres in a desperate effort to revive the tarnished image of the United Nations. American youths are to serve, and more than likely, to die, in the effort to rehabilitate the United Nations. Their families will be notified that they died in the service of the United Nations. Clinton justified this act of high treason by announcing that “We must continue to bear the responsibility of the world’s leadership in Bosnia, as elsewhere. If the United States does not lead, the job will not be done.” But Clinton’s action is contrary to the expressed purpose of the United Nations, which states that all nation members must share equal responsibility. We are now witness to the discouraging spectacle of a financially bankrupt United States bearing the billion-dollar-a-day cost of maintaining peacekeeping troops in Bosnia for a morally bankrupt United Nations. Clinton’s action comes at a time when there is a growing chorus from both liberals and conservatives that the day of the United Nations has come and gone. Nation magazine noted on Nov. 13, 1995 that Congressman Joe Scarborough of Florida had introduced a resolution on the occasion of the United Nations’ fiftieth anniversary to take the United States out of the United Nations. This has been officially catalogued as “The United Nations Withdrawal Act of 1995”. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was quoted as having denounced the United Nations as a “rathole”. The New Republic suggested in a lead article, Oct. 30, 1995, that the United Nations “be allowed to wither away into irrelevance”. Even a staunch Clinton supporter and State Department official, Strobe Talbott, warned in an August speech that “The United Nations might very"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"quickly join the League of Nations on the ash heap of history.” In fact, we were relieved of the League of Nations only by the advent of the Second World War. Both the United Nations and the League of Nations were the creations of the central banks, manipulated by the House of Rothschild to cover up their financial control of the entire world. The activities in Bosnia, where both previous world wars were launched, indicate that the United Nations will indeed join the League of Nations on the ash heap of history through the convenient outbreak of the Third World War. ************************************************ 12.) Requiem For A Heavyweight 12/24/95 In the dog-eat-dog world of conservative talk radio, the undisputed heavyweight is Chuck Harder. Out-weighing his closest competitor, Rush Limbaugh, by more than one hundred pounds, Chuck broadcasts his daily three-hour monologues from the historic Hotel Telford, the former winter resort of many American presidents in White Springs, Florida. After trying a number of angles to build up his radio talk show, including extensive dedication to the current UFO craze, Chuck allowed two well known, hardline conservatives, Bobby Lee, also known as “The Mouth of the South” and a fiery young broadcaster, Tom Donahue, to air their shows on his network. Chuck was amazed at the tremendous audience reaction when these hosts exposed the JFK assassination, the Trilateral Commission, the Federal Reserve operation, and when they frequently interviewed an oldtime conservative, Eustace Mullins. Their rapidly growing audiences now presented a serious threat to Chuck’s radio show. They vanished from his network, and he began to have Eustace Mullins as a guest on his show. He generated so many calls from listeners that he became the only guest whom Chuck kept on the air for the entire three hours of his program. Chuck also began to feature Mullins’ books, selling more than two hundred copies a month at his net profit of ten dollars per book. Mullins’ relationship with Chuck prospered for several years. Then Mullins filed a one-hundred-million-dollar lawsuit against the Anti- Defamation League for criminal terrorism and religious persecution. Mullins is still the only person who has ever dared to sue the much feared ADL. The ADL promptly struck back with a nationwide campaign to put him out of business. They intimidated organizers from inviting him to lecture or appear on their talk shows, and they systematically went after his national book distributors, of whom Chuck was the largest. These ADL activities were criminal violations of many statutes against censorship, conspiracy to injure and defraud, intimidation and extortion, all of which have long been the ADL’s stock in trade."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Chuck was now appearing on 380 stations throughout the United States. He became the ADL’s prime target. An agent was dispatched to White Springs, Florida to set Chuck up for the fall. The agent pretended that he was writing an article about Chuck for the New York Times . Chuck invited him into the hotel, wined and dined him for four days, and let him inspect all of the facets of his daily operation. It is difficult to believe that anyone could be so naive as to open up his offices to an agent, but Chuck was dazed by the prospect of being featured in the New York Times . An article duly appeared, but not in the New York Times . Chuck had been gulled by a writer for the Nation , the last survivor of a plethora of hard line, leftwing weeklies echoing the now-antiquated Stalinist party line out of Moscow. The agent’s article, while generally fair to Chuck, criticized him harshly for his association with Eustace Mullins, whom he identifed as “a classical anti-Semite” as opposed to the more general classification of a “non-classical anti-Semite”. I immediately wrote Chuck a letter in which I explained at great length my position of opposition to the Rothschild’s “Reform Judaism” which created the State of Israel, in defiance of the longstanding Orthodox Jewish faith that until the Messiah appeared, there could be no political Jewish state on Earth. Chuck never replied, nor did he offer me an opportunity to demolish the ADL attack. To make their point, the ADL had several stations cancel their contract with Chuck. Seeing the bleak picture ahead of him, Chuck announced that there had indeed been “a problem” with one book and that he was withdrawing this book and that its author would never again be allowed to appear on his show. He was very careful not to give his audience any indication of who this author was, because he would have provoked a firestorm of criticism. In fact, he had been featuring three of my titles, all of which were withdrawn, even though they were his steady best sellers. Listeners who write in for my books are now told they are out of them, and they don’t know when they will get any more copies. At no time is my name ever mentioned, or the title of the books. In a lengthy apologia pro vita sua which the Nation published, Chuck complained that he had been attacked by extremists as “a tool of Jewish and Israeli interests”, and that he had done special programs on the Holocaust featuring Rabbi Marvin Hier of the notorious Simon Weisenthal Center. My own response to Nation characterized the Holocaust as a “non-issue” and a figment of Jewish nightmares. I denounced “the attempt to force the entire civilized world to become a Wailing Wall for the Holocaust represents an essential morbidity of the Jewish psyche, a cult of death, which no psychiatrist cares to discuss.” I also raised the question, “Why do the Jews refuse to discuss the fact that Stalin killed more Jews than Hitler?” The agent’s response to my published letter in the Nation denounced me for having written an article, “Ezra Pound: Unknown Hero”. He described me with the usual ADL venom as “such a vile character as Eustace Mullins, the sort we thought we got rid of at Nuremberg”. The ADL has complained for years that I was not tried at Nuremberg. This would have been difficult, since I was serving in the U.S. Army Air Force at the time. By jettisoning me at the demand of the ADL, Chuck seems to have survived for the time being. However, he exists now solely at the courtesy of the ADL. In all fairness, he should open his program each day with the announcement, “The following program is brought to you by permission of the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, which is solely"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"responsible for its content.” Chuck and his For The People operation also was easy prey for the ADL conspiracy because he had set the organization up as a 501C3 business for the purpose of tax exemption. This made him a sitting duck for any type of ADL pressure and consequent government harassment by any of the many government bureaus which answer only to the ADL. A recent CNN survey of his operation obtained copies of his tax returns, showing that he only grosses four-million dollars a year, a very modest operation. In contrast, ADL- approved propaganda shows such as Pat Robertson and Billy Graham take in more than five million dollars a week each. It is unlikely that Chuck Harder’s wildcat For the People network will give the ADL any more problems, but should this occur, they are well prepared to silence him whenever they wish. ************************************************ 13.) More On Japanese Culture: My Visit to the Grand Shrines of Ise 04/02/96 During my travels in Japan during February, 1996, through many busy days and varied experiences, it became apparent to me that the most memorable event of my tour was my visit to the Grand Shrines of Ise (Ise is pronounced Ee-say). My hosts had explained to me that Ise was an important shrine of the Japanese people, in fact, THE most important shrine; but even this advance information did not fully prepare me for the overwhelming presence which I encountered at Ise. At the Grand Shrines of Ise, I was overcome by the revelation of the power of a great nation, and whence that power came. The Western world has been seduced by the myth that power comes from machines. A philosophy of history, dialectical materialism or Communism, was developed to persuade us to worship the machine, in the power of the State, as the source of all power. The problem with dialectical materialism is that the machine cannot create itself; it must be built by people. Therefore, it would be more logical to worship the power which brought the machine into being, rather than the machine itself. The Communists have never been able to solve this dilemma, which explains the diminishing power of Communism as a world force. While Communism weakens, the people of Japan continue to grow and prosper. What is their secret? I came to believe, after visiting the Grand Shrines of Ise, that this is their secret -- their belief in themselves and the spiritual power which sustains them, as exemplified by the Grand Shrines of Ise. In the Western world, we emphasize that the individual is everything, and that the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"individual can accomplish anything. But in fact, the power of the individual is limited by the fact that he is only one person. In order to accomplish important things, he must combine with other individuals. We have learned to do this by combining in corporations, which can amass manpower and capital, and extend their influence throughout the world. Certainly these achievements are impressive, but here again, we must ask: is there another power which makes this possible? The answer to this question can be found in the temples of a nation. In the West, we built great Gothic cathedrals throughout Europe in the twelfth century. Although the West has prospered since those cathedrals were built, no more cathedrals were constructed. Is it not logical to expect that as the West prospered, even greater and more magnificent cathedrals would have been built? But they have not been built. There is an explanation for this. The West, after the cathedrals had been built, changed its allegiance. Abandoning the spiritual power which inspired the building of the great cathedrals, the West transferred its reverence to a new object of worship: the worship of capital, the power of money. The people accepted the premise that capital was now the most powerful force in the world. However, capital did not produce any more great cathedrals. Instead, the Capitalists designed their banks and office buildings to look like smaller cathedrals. The Age of the Cathedrals had ended. At the Grand Shrines of Ise, I realized that a magnificent cathedral is not the ultimate manifestation of spiritual power. Here, I found a perfect harmony of shrine and nature, an effect which was the very purpose of the shrine. I began to understand that a shrine or temple has a purpose far greater than that of a building. It is a place where the guiding force of a great nation can be focused, as a magnifying glass focuses the rays of the Sun into the much greater power of fire. Economists in the West describe the “Miracle of Japan” exclusively as an economic force, the power of production. At the Grand Shrines of Ise, I learned that behind this power is a much greater power, the power of the spirit. This is the power of Japan. However, many foreigners do not visit the shrine, and thus they remain ignorant of the moving force of this nation. The moment I walked onto the grounds of Ise, I became aware of this force. It was a very powerful experience because it revealed to me why I had been brought to Japan, the real reason for my being there. Many people had worked together to bring me to Japan, and I am very grateful for their efforts, which have resulted in a very rewarding experience. Not until I came to the Grand Shrines of Ise did I understand the power which had compelled them to bring me here. Henceforth, my mission would be to raise the level of understanding between the people of Japan and the people of the United States. Other Westerners had preceded me in this mission, most notably, Ernest Fenollosa, whose memorial I had been able to visit on my tour, and my mentor and guide, the poet Ezra Pound, who had pioneered the understanding of Japanese art in the Western world. Such an improvement of the understanding between Japan and the United States is not an undertaking designed solely to benefit either party, but to benefit both. However, it may be"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"that the United States would be the greater beneficiary, if the presence of Japan, as exempllfied by the Grand Shrines of Ise, could help the American people to realize that they have wandered off the track, that they have been lured into the worship of false gods, and that, as the great Shrines of Ise so compellingly remind us, in the final analysis -- the bottom line, as it were -- spiritual power is a much greater force than either the power of money or the power of the machine. The ritual service in the temple served to confirm my initial impression, that I was indeed in the presence of a very powerful force. For years, I had listened to Japanese court music, and now I was privileged to hear the music of the ceremony. This is not merely the ceremony of an ancient culture, but of a culture which remains pure and vibrant despite the pressures of the modern world. In the West, religion has bowed to the blandishments of dialectical materialism, and has altered its message to embrace social, if not socialist, goals. The result is that the people receive no spiritual refreshing, and must face the problems of the world without spiritual energy and belief. It may seem that this is a great deal of experience to result from a few hours at the Grand Shrines of Ise, but I have merely recounted reaction to the spiritual presence which I found there. A revelation can be of only a few seconds duration or it can be an experience recollected much later in tranquillity. Although I stored all of these emotions while I was at the shrine, it was not until much later that I was able to sort them out and to realize the importance of this visit. Few people today seem to be capable of receiving such a revelation, because we are intent on being entertained. We do not like to have an experience unless it is pleasurable. However, pleasure is of short duration, and the sensation must be repeated ad infinitum, if one is to continue to enjoy it. This is not true of a revelation, which can last for a lifetime. There are many recorded instances of persons receiving a revelation which not only changed their life but sustained them for a lifetime. An unfortunate aspect of modern life is that we are continuously bombarded by so many experiences, which are not only temporary but which have no importance. The power of the spiritual life is that it prepares us for, and makes it possible for us to receive more important experiences. A shrine serves the great purpose of allowing us to be renewed at the source of power. Throughout history, civilizations have crumbled after their shrines became corrupted and were no longer a source of power and faith. This usually occurred because the people were no longer worthy of their shrines, and because they themselves were corrupted. This was most notably illustrated by the Cult of Baal, which preceded Christianity in the ancient world. The worshippers of Baal converted their temples into houses of prostitution, where they routinely sacrificed small children for “good luck”. Although the Baalites disappeared from history, remnants of their cult still operate surreptitiously throughout the world, spreading destruction in their wake. One might well ask, how is it that I, who am not Japanese, can visit the Grand Shrines of Ise and experience so much? The answer is that I am able to experience these powers because I am aware of my own identity. As the ancient Greeks said, nothing human is alien to me. I walk on the Earth to increase understanding, because I do not have to be preoccupied with my own problems. In the West, many people are fascinated with the need"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"to “discover” one’s identity, to “find oneself’. However, one’s identity is not a secret, nor is it a vein of gold hidden away which we must spend our life searching for. People refuse to accept their identity because they do not wish to face the responsibility which that acceptance implies. Once we know who we are, we can no longer evade our life’s task by the protest that “I would like to do somethig, but I am not yet ready, because I first must find out who I really am.” This is the pretext of the immature, the eternal student, who explains, “I am not ready to assume the duties of life because I am not yet prepared.” In fact, everyone on Earth has a purpose, a task, which can be postponed only by the continued denial of one’s identity. No one can “develop” or “find” their identity, because they are born with it. A vast profession has grown up to intervene with those who deny their identity -- the profession of psychotherapy, which offers a crutch for their denial of identity. These were some of the revelations which came to me at the Grand Shrines of Ise. Even the gods must occasionally pause to rest, and it is at these places that we can build a shrine. As I walked through its grounds, I understood that the people of Japan have their identity. The strength of spiritual power is that it authorizes you to accept your identity, and thereby to become a functional member of society. I do not believe I could have come to such a conclusion in any religious building in America, because those buildings exclude nature. At the Grand Shrines of Ise, I was convinced that this shrine celebrates the place of Man on Earth, in the presence of the Sun goddess, and the harmony of this partnership. I too was able to enjoy the intense inner peace which I saw in the face of others present, and which I have only found in two other places: the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, and in the more volcanic areas of Yellowstone National Park. In Japan, at the Grand Shrines of Ise, I experienced the grandeur of life, the grandeur of nature, and the hope of the future. ************************************************  14.) American Standoff -- The Inside Story of the Montana Freemen 04/22/96 Once again the UNited States is in the grip of a massive standoff of government agents against American citizens. Jordan, Montana, the site of the standoff which has now been in effect for some thirty days, may go down in American history as a name of equal prominence with Lexington and Concord, as the launching pad for the New American Revolution. Or it may join the tragic names of Ruby Ridge and Waco as the site of yet another vicious massacre of American dissidents. “Lucky Bill” Clinton is on the horns of a genuine dilemma. It is too near the national elections to stage yet another massacre of Americans. Nor can he divert the public’s attention with another foreign venture of the United Nations. He has already staged Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia as the equivalent of the Roman motto of “bread and circuses” to"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"keep Americans from thinking about their domestic problems. He has nowhere else to go. ANOTHER BLOODBATH? Although his faithful hireling, Attorney General Janet Reno, is said to be panting for yet another bloodbath in the great tradition of her previous escapades at Ruby Ridge and Waco, Clinton is reluctant to float his reelection aspirations on another sea of blood. He recently buried his greatest re-election liability, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who was facing numerous investigations for the most flagrant gathering-in of bribes in our political history. “Lucky Bill”, with the historic Clinton luck, was “devastated” by the news that Brown would not be standing trial before the election, because his plane had fortuitously slammed into a hill in Bosnia. At this writing, his only advice to the federal agents besieging the dissidents at Jordan, Montana, is “Hold your fire.” MORE CRIMINALS Although the entire United States is paralyzed by the outbreaks of crime in the nation’s cities, once again, hundreds of “law enforcement” agents are deployed against a handful of Americans in a remote Montana hamlet. It is noteworthy that Jordan has never had a crime problem. What lured these hundreds of federal agents to the area? They had discovered that an armed and extremely dangerous family was holed up on a 964-acre ranch near Jordan. These “dangerous” criminals are accused of mail fraud, conspiracy, and bank fraud because they issued some $19.5 million in checks and money orders between August 1994 and December 1995. I feel some personal responsibility for the actions of the accused, because they were following precepts and documented information which I had released to the American public in 1953, and which have now alerted at least ten million Americans to the nature of the problem. This information, presently available under the title of “ Secrets of the Federal Reserve ”, documents that in Thanksgiving week of 1910, some of the world’s leading bankers gathered at the Millionaire’s Club at Jekyll Island, Georgia, a group representing one-sixth of the wealth of the entire world, to enter into a criminal conspiracy to seize all of the money and credit of the American people. The Conspirators had gone to considerable effort to keep their identity and their purpose secret, which is the prime evidence of conspiracy to commit a crime. They were functioning as a “syndicate” under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation, a prime example of a syndicate, and under orders from Baron Rothschild of London to produce a plan which would give them total control of the money and credit of the people of the United States. The Jekyll Island group was led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, Majority Leader of the Senate. His daughter, Abby Aldrich, had married John D. Rockefeller, Jr. a few years before this meeting. Also present was Frank Vanderlip, president of National City Bank, the depository for the billions of income from Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly; Paul Warburg, of Kuhn, Loeb Co., New York, the secret agent of the House of Rothschild in the United States, and Henry P. Davison, right hand man of J.P.Morgan, also a secret Rothschild agent."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Oxford English Dictionary defines a “syndicate” as follows: “3. A combination of capitalists and financiers entered into for the purpose of prosecuting a scheme requiring large sources of capital, especially one having the object of obtaining control of the market in a particular commodity.” At Jekyll Island, the goal was to obtain a monopoly of money, which J.P. Morgan himself had defined, in testimony before the Pujo Committee, as “Money is a commodity.” Their monopoly plan, written at Jekyll Island, was presented to the Congress in 1913 as the Federal Reserve plan, although it was the antithesis of “federal”, because it transferred Congress’ historic mission to issue money, as defined in Article II, Section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, delivering this function to a privately-owned bank, the Federal Reserve Bank. This private bank, in the language of the Federal Reserve Act, was now designated as the official fiscal agent of the United States. It had no “reserves”, nor did it need any, because it now had a license from Congress to print as much money as it chose, with no restrictions or oversight from Congress. Although the Federal Reserve scrip initially had gold backing, this was surreptitiously removed in later years. The final step in this conspiracy was achieved in 1942. Noted financial writer, Henry Hazlitt, wrote in Newsweek magazine for January 4, 1943: “The money that began to appear in circulation a week ago, December 21 ,1942, was really printing-press money in the fullest sense of the term, that is, money which has no collateral of any kind behind it... We repeat, these notes have absolutely no collateral of any kind behind them.” MONEY WITHOUT BACKING After I had alerted millions of my fellow-Americans to this production of Federal Reserve notes which had no backing or collateral, a few citizens resolved that, as Americans in good standing, they also could issue checks and other negotiable instruments with collateral the equivalent to that of the Federal Reserve notes -- that is, none. Thus is the background for the $19.5 million of “bogus” checks and money orders which caused the government to charge the Freemen with conspiracy and fraud. But their “conspiracy” had been preceded by the criminal syndicate which met secretly at Jekyll Island, and which had functioned since 1914 without hindrance from the government. What was the difference between the Freemen of Jordan and the private stockholders of the Federal Reserve Bank? Legally, none. The only charge that could be brought against them is cutting themselves in on the private monopoly of the Federal Reserve Bank. Although the Federal Reserve System indeed was chartered under authority of the Congress of the United States, it has no legal standing in court because it originated as a secret criminal conspiracy, thoroughly documented in my work. In fact, the Jordan ranchers probably are less criminal than the dynastic families which have owned the Private stock of the Federal Reserve Banks since 1914."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY In issuing their checks and money orders, the Jordan group could be said to follow the great tradition of American banking, as documented on page 157 of Secrets Of The Federal Reserve : “Governor W.P.G. Harding of the Federal Reserve Board testified in 1921 that ‘The Federal Reserve Bank is an institution owned by the stockholding member banks. The Government has not a dollar’s worth of stock in it.’ “ From page 167 of Secrets : “on September 30, 1941, before the House Committee on Banking and currency, was asked by Representative Wright Patman, chairman of the Committee: ‘How did you get the money to buy those two billion dollars worth of Government securities in 1933?’ ECCLES: We created it. PATMAN: Out of what? ECCLES. Out of the right to issue credit money. MR. PATMAN: And there is nothing behind it, is there, except our Government’s credit? ECCLES: That is what our money system is. If there were no debts in our money system, there wouldn’t be any money.” What Chairman Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board was referring to was the ancient, five- thousand year-old Babylonian money system, in which all money is created out of debt. This scheme finally enslaves the entire population in a sea of unpayable debt. Congressman Wright Patman explains in his groundbreaking book, The Primer of Money , that “The cash, in truth, does not exist and has never existed. What we call ‘cash reserves’ are simply bookkeeping credits entered upon bookkeeping ledgers of the Federal Reserve Banks. The credits are created ty the Federal Reserve Banks and then passed along through the banking system.” As Patman tells us, the Federal Reserve’s private stockholders “create money out of nothing” as “bookkeeping credits entered upon ledgers”. Thus our entire five-trillion-dollar “national debt” has never existed except as entries in the ledgers of the Federal Reserve Banks. We can hardly criticize the Jordan ranchers for deciding to do the same thing, as spelled out in my work. The system of the conspirators is further detailed by Peter L. Bernstein, in A Primer On Money , Banking and Gold. He says: “The trick in the Federal Reserve notes is that the Federal Reserve banks lose no cash when"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"they pay out this currency to the member banks. Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in anything except what the Government calls ‘legal tender’ -- that is, money that a creditor must be willing to accept from a debtor in payment of sums owed him. But since all Federal Reserve notes are themselves declared by law to be legal money, they are really redeemable only in themselves... they are an irredeemable obligation issued by the Federal Reserve Banks.” JORDAN RANCHERS ISSUE “MONEY” The Jordan ranchers availed themselves of “equal opportunity” to write checks and money orders redeemable only in themselves, the identical manner in which Federal Reserve notes are issued. Furthermore, the “paper” of the Jordan ranchers was accepted by both banks and individuals. Once it has been accepted, there is no further legal claim on the ranchers. However, it seems unlikely that they will ever be given the opportunity to document this in court, or to have me testify on their behalf. What we are seeing is the potential toppling of the entire Federal Reserve debt structure, which cannot be substantiated even in their own Admiralty courts or under authority of the Crown of England and the Bank of England, which is its sole authority. The hundreds of federal agents now assembled at Jordan are there as “Federal Reserve” police whose sole mission is to enforce the Federal Reserve monopoly against any encroachment, while the “Federal Reserve press” the mass media of the UNited States, carries on a frenetic propaganda war against the Jordan group, denouncing them as check forgers who commit wire fraud and mail fraud. LAND SEIZURE The 964-acre ranch which is the scene of the standoff had previously been foreclosed and sold. The ranchers protested that the bank had not advanced them any “substance for substance” as is required by the law of contract, and that they had merely advanced them “bookkeeping ledger entries”, as is the custom with the Federal Reserve System and the banks with which it does business. The Federal Reserve System also requires a code number on all negotiable instruments which it handles, this secret code being an integral part of its conspiracy. Thus all those who transact business using these secret code numbers are drawn into the conspiracy against their will, and become reluctant serfs of its system. To prevent the seizure of their land, the ranchers officially reorganized its ownership, establishing it as “Justus Township”. Under the laws governing townships, they have continued to operate legally and are not guilty of any offense. The present situation is that the ranchers are now defending their township, and any armed attack against it consitutes a violation of the laws under which it had been established. Their defense is in the great tradition of the laws of the United States, its Constitution , as well as the preceding centuries of English common law, including the Magna Carta and Sir Edward Coke’s Petition Of Right , which was one of the forerunners of our Constitution ."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Coke’s Petition Of Right of 1628 was signed into law as the “ Declaration of Rights ” on February 13, 1689. It was Sir Edward Coke who glorified the Magna Carta as the most important document in the evolution of the common law of England. The Magna Carta was drawn up June 15, 1215, at Runnymede, England under the leadership of King John. Among the assembled Barons was Eustace de Vesci. Of the sixty-three paragraphs of the Magna Carta , I have most frequently quoted, in my legal briefs during the past fifty years, paragraph 39: “No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possession, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.” I have never found a judge in any United States court who paid the slightest attention to my citing of this paragraph. The Freemen of Montana may have taken their name from this paragraph, which is also quoted in more concise form as, “No freeman shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, or in any way destroyed, nor will we proceed against him or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers, and by the law of the land.” The Founding Fathers later reprised this paragraph in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the UNited States , “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a grand jury, nor shall any person... be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Paragraph 9 of the Magna Carta states, “Neither we nor our officials will seize any land or rent in payment of a debt, so long as the debtor has movable goods sufficient to discharge the debt. A debtor’s sureties shall not be distrained upon so long as the debtor himself can discharge his debt.” The Freemen discharged their debt, and protected their land, by issuing negotiable instruments which had the same backing as the Federal Reserve notes, and which should have been equally honored under the law. Paragraph 34 of the Magna Carta , which I also used frequently in my lawsuits against governmental authorities, says, “The writ called precipe shall not in future be issued to anyone in respect of any holding of land, if a free man could thereby be deprived of the right of trial in his own lord’s court.” In U.S. courts, a praecipe is a notice of a legal action, or of a step in said action, such as a motion or hearing. The permanence of the Magna Carta’s provisions is assured by King John in the concluding paragraph 63, “IT IS ACCORDINGLY OUR WISH AND COMMAND that"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"the English Church shall be free, and that men in our kingdom shall have and keep all these liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peacably in their fulness and entirety for them and their heirs, of us and our heirs, in all things and all places for ever.” In view of controversies surrounding the holding of stock in the Federal Reserve banks, many of the stockholders, being foreigners, paragraph ten and eleven of the Magna Carta could be applicable. Paragraph ten stipulates that: “If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies before the debt has been repaid, his heirs shall pay no interest on the debt for so long as he remains under age.” Paragraph eleven states that “If a man dies owing money to Jews, his wife may have her dower and pay nothing towards the debt from it.” MAYFLOWER COMPACT When the signers of the Mayflower Compact (including William Mullins) drew up the first governing instrument in the New World, on November 11, 1620, they resolved “solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick.” This was the origin of government in the future UNited States. When it was refined into the Constitution , the emphasis was not upon the rights of government, but upon the rights of its citizens, and the necessity for protecting them against encroachments by the government, necessitated by the tyrannies which they had fled in the Old World. The Freemen of Montana are acting in the great tradition of these guarantees. They are acting from right of conscience, from the knowledge of their beliefs, and from their willingness to defend those beliefs from any encroachment by the federal power. Any assault upon those unalienable rights constitutes a violation of the statutes prohibiting same, principally U.S. Code 42, Sections 1983 through 1986. The federal agents’ confrontation of the Montana Freemen not only violates Title 42 of the civil code, but also Title 18 of the Criminal Code, Sections 41 and 42. The federal agents have established no legal basis for this confrontation or assault. The surrounding of private property by regiments of heavily armed men constitutes an assault even if no shots are fired, because the residents can reasonably expect that their lives are in danger. They are responding as We the People of the United States, prepared not only to defend themselves, but also their rights. There is a further and more disturbing aspect of the federal agents’ presence at the Jordan ranch. They are there at the behest of a foreign government, the State of Israel, operating through its unregistered agent in the UNited States, the Jewish Masonic B’Nai B’Rith and its assault arm, the Anti-Defamation League. Not only does the ADL operate as a quasi-religious group, in violation of U.S. statutes, but also as the moving force behind any federal agency’s assault upon groups such as the Montana Freemen. The very name Freemen is an affront to the tyrannical ADL, which aims to reduce all American citizens to the status of serfs of Israel. Because of the religious aspects of the federal agents’ presence, they should be withdrawn before they launch their final bloody assault, as they did at the ADL-directed atrocities at Ruby Ridge and the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Waco Holocaust. FREEMEN HAVE COMMITTED NO CRIME In conclusion, the Montana Freemen deserve the active support and praise of every American citizen because they have drawn the line. They have said, “You shall not pass this spot!” Because of their courageous action in challenging the foreign money monopoly of the Federal Reserve System, they may have set in motion a tidal wave of events which may destroy this monster and restore the historic liberties of all Americans. We can help, first and foremost, by understanding what they are trying to do. These are not the petty criminals portrayed by the media, who are writing bad checks. They are citizens who believe they have the right to issue unbacked money instruments as the Federal Reserve System has been doing, unchecked, since 1914. Heretofore, the Federal Reserve courts, as the Admiralty courts of the Bank of England are known in the United States, have succeeded in sentencing anyone who challenged the powers of the Federal Reserve System to long terms in prison. For the first time, we have the opportunity to join with the Montana Freemen and their courageous battle for justice. They named their headquarters, “Justus Township”, which can not only be interpreted as a crusade for justice, but also as “Just Us” -- just American citizens, us, working together to build a greater and more harmonious nation. ************************************************ 15.) The $5 Trillion Cold War Hoax 04/29/96 P.T. Barnum said it for all time, “There’s a sucker born every minute.” For more than four decades, the American people have been terrorized, not by a foreign threat, but by their own government. In order for the Federal Reserve System central bankers to continue to loot the nation after the successful conclusion of the Second World War, they had to invent a new threat. The only candidate was our erstwhile gallant ally, the Soviet Union. The central bank conspirators faced the task of continuing to mobilize the people against a terrible threat, taxing them heavily in order to save them from destruction. Today, we are burdened by a $5 trillion national debt. Coincidentally, that is the sum we have spent on “national defense” since 1945. The World Order billionaires launched a complex, long-term plan to demonize Soviet Russia. Overnight, they would undergo a sea change, from the darlings of the American political Establishment to a dangerous and possibly overwhelming enemy. In my researches of more than fifty years, I finally located the smoking gun which exposed this conspiracy, a little known article in the August 1977 issue of American Heritage magazine, “Who Started the Cold War?” by historian Charles"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"L. Mee Jr., editor of Horizon magazine, and author of one of the first cold war books, Meeting at Potsdam . “SCARE THE HELL OUT OF THE COUNTRY” In this article, Mee writes that on Feb. 27, 1947, “President Truman met with Congressional leaders in the White House. Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson was present at the meeting, and Truman had him tell the Congressmen what was at stake. Acheson spoke for ten minutes, informing the legislators that nothing less than the survival of the whole of Western civilization was in the balance at that moment; he worked in references to ancient Athens, Rome, and the course of Western civilization and freedom since those times. The Congressmen were silent for a few moments, and then, at last, Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, a prominent Republican who had come to support an active foreign policy, spoke up. All this might be true, Vandenberg said, but, if the President wishes to sell his program to the American people, he would have to ‘scare hell out of the country’. It was at that moment that the Cold War began in earnest for the United States.” This is one of the most revealing statements in American history. This is the smoking gun which proves that the federal government used a terror campaign to frighten the American people into supporting four decades of Cold War spending on armaments. The initial campaign was the “atom bomb scare”, -- which raged for some years; it finally lost its effectiveness, and was replaced by the ogre, based solely on falsified and invented CIA statistics, that Soviet Russia was the most terrifying military power, with the fastest growing economy, in the world. These two CIA claims were mutually exclusive; no nation could have the world’s greatest military machine and at the same time support the world’s fastest growing economy, but the statisticians successfully sold this scare story for years.  CHURCHILL LAUNCHES COLD WAR The Cold War, the Hegelian invention of Soviet Russia and the United States at each other’s throats, the “free world” vs. the “slave empire”, Capitalism vs. Communism, was the final triumph of dialectical materialism, also invented by the German philosopher, Hegel. He laid down the dictum that to rule the world, you create a problem; you find an antidote to that problem; and you throw the two conflicting theses against each other, to result in a consensus or resolution. This diabolical and cynical formula reached its apogee in the Cold War. Hopefully, we will not see another such travesty of history. Hard on the conclusion of the Second World War, the Colossus of the United States stood astride the entire world. With the world’s largest economy, never touched by a single bomb or artillery shell throughout the war, the largest army, and a proud and victorious people, it was incredible that the United States could for a moment seriously regard the war- devastated Soviet Union as a threat. Stalin lost forty million people during the war; his nation was in ruins. He desperately needed a breathing space in which to recover. Miraculously, the World Order invention of the Cold War came to his rescue. None other than Stalin’s co-conspirator, Winston Churchill, was chosen to launch this new “problem”."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Now unemployed, Churchill was desperate to get back into the limelight. At the invitation of President Truman, Churchill was brought to the United States to deliver a speech at little Fulton College, in Truman’s home state of Missouri. On March 5, 1946, at Fulton, Churchill made his famous “Iron Curtain” speech. He warned that an “Iron Curtain” had descended upon Europe, the Communist enslavement of the Eastern European countries. He failed to mention that he and Franklin Delano Roosevelt had joined at Yalta to deliver Eastern Europe to Stalin, with Alger Hiss, the originator of the plan, beaming in the background. Not a single journalist, anywhere in the world, mentioned Churchill’s overwhelming personal complicity in creating and maintaining the dire situation which he now publicly deplored. THE CONVERSION OF SENATOR ARTHUR VANDENBERG One of Washington’s leading political strategists, Senator Arthur Vandenberg had warned his co-conspirators at the Feb. 27, 1947 White House meeting that to sell the prospective Cold War program, they would have to “scare hell out of the country”. He had an interesting background. A millionaire newspaper publisher in Grand Rapids, Michigan (later to become famous as the home of President Gerald Ford), Vandenberg had been elected to the Senate in 1928. A rock-ribbed Republican, he voted against New Deal measures such as the Social Security Act. He was Republican minority leader, and Capitol Hill’s leading isolationist. When the United Nations proposal came to Congress, no one in Washington doubted that Vandenberg would shoot it down. All of Washington was amazed when Senator Vandenberg rose on the Senate floor, on January 10, 1945, and called for the establishment of the United Nations. As George Stimpson, founder of the National Press Club, later explained to me, America’s leading isolationist had become a rabid internationalist in a single night. A beautiful blonde agent from British Secret Intelligence Service had been sent to his room. After an all night political discussion, Senator Vandenberg awakened to become the new champion of the United Nations. Although a little known story, it epitomizes how things are accomplished in Washington, today as yesterday. This is the Senator who is described in the Dictionary of National Biography as “a jingoist and chauvinist who supported the aggressive foreign policies of Theodore Roosevelt and Taft.” Franklin D. Roosevelt rewarded Vandenberg for his treachery by sending him as a special delegate to San Francisco with Alger Hiss to draft the United Nations Charter. The White House continued to shower gifts on Vandenberg, even going so far as to make his favorite nephew, General Hoyt Vandenberg, Commanding General of the United States Air Force. THE FLOOZIES OF WASHINGTON During our discussions at the National Press Club in 1948, the subject of Senator Arthur Vandenberg’s overnight conversion to the congressional champion of the United Nations was examined in detail. We recalled a fellow agent of the blonde British Secret Service"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"agent who accomplished this mission, one Kaye Summersby, who had been chosen to mollify General Eisenhower, Commanding General of the entire European Theater during the Second World War. Summersby’s intelligence training included the arts of the ancient Byzantine hetairae, who were skilled in the arts of “unendurable pleasure, indefinitely prolonged”. With Summersby as his chauffeur, Eisenhower was delivered to small country hotels in England, while his adviser, the political commissar Capt. Edward M. M. Warburg, of the banking family, ran the war from London. The enraptured general notified his superior, George Marshall, that he was divorcing Mamie Eisenhower to marry the princess of endless delights, which of course was never in the cards. Marshall promptly reported this development to President Truman, who was furious, notifying Ike that it was out of the question ( Plain Speaking , by Merle Miller). Kaye ended her days as a permanent house guest on a Rothschild estate on Long Island. Another British agent, Pamela Digby Churchill, married to Winston Churchill’s son, later married Averill Harriman, the unofficial foreign minister of the United States. Harriman’s exploits in travelling the world, instructing the heads of nations in how to conduct their affairs, was legendary. He became the subject of a series of novels by Upton Sinclair, chronicling the feats of one Lanny Budd (Harriman) throughout the world. Harriman spent the last two years of World War II at Stalin’s Kremlin headquarters, dictating to Stalin how he should conduct the war. After his death, Pamela Churchill Harriman took over the Democratic National Committee. She is now our Ambassador to Paris, the most desired appointment in our foreign service, presiding over 1100 employees. HARRIMAN’S REPLY When Charles T. Mee Jr.‘s historic article appeared in American Heritage magazine in August of 1977, the editors notified Averill Harriman and gave him the chance to reply in the same issue. Harriman’s reponse was headlined “We Can’t Do Business with Stalin”. The Communist dictator who had been Harriman’s lackey throughout the war was now dismissed as uncooperative! Harriman recounts in great detail the repressive policies of Stalin towards the captive nations in Eastern Europe (policies which Harriman himself had initiated), and goes on to denounce Mee’s astounding report as “revisionist”. “Mr. Mee has made his own sketchy revision of standard revisionist’ doctrine,” quoting Mee’s statement that “the Cold War served everybody’s purpose.” Truman needed an excuse for deficit spending, because without it he could not have kept the American economy busy and productive. Thus he waged a Cold War, after the hot war was won, to justify continued deficit spending. With the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, the encouragement of American multinational companies, and a set of defense treaties that came finally to encompass the world, he institutionalized it.” As Charles T. Mee Jr. points out in his article, Stalin was a principal beneficiary of the Cold War. “Stalin needed the Cold War, not to venture out into the world again after an exhausting war, but to discipline his restless people at home. He had need of that ancient stratagem of monarchs -- the threat of an implacable external enemy to be used to unite his own people in Russia.” Mee also names Winston Churchill as a prime suspect in the Cold War conspiracy. He states that Churchill “emerged from World War II with a ruined"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"empire, irretrievably in debt, an empire losing its colonies and headed inevitably toward bankruptcy. Churchill’s scheme for saving Great Britain was .. to arrange to have America and Russia quarrel; while America and Russia quarrelled, England would -- as American diplomats delicately put it -- ‘lead’ Europe”. As had been the case for some three hundred years, “leading” Europe and the United States meant that Great Britain would make frequent use of its secret weapon, the Secret Intelligence Service. Its powers included, as we have seen, reversing the entire foreign policy of the United States overnight, from isolationism to an abject embracing of the United Nations; making the most prominent American general and future President a “love slave” of a ruthless intelligence agent, and much, much more, most of which we shall never know. THE FIRST VICTIMS OF THE COLD WAR The first victims of the Cold War were not soldiers; they were American politicians who were reluctant to embrace the new campaign. The first casualty was elder statesman Henry Stimson, who wrote a memo to President Truman in the autumn of 1945, cited by Mee as the cause of Stimson’s disappearance from Washington. Stimson’s memo denounced the projected Cold War as a serious error, and called for “satisfactory relations” with Russia. Henry Wallace, Secretary of Commerce, also protested against the Cold War; he was allowed to resign. Mee identifies the “comers” in Washington as those who were quick to latch onto the Cold War as “the wave of the future”. Those who tended to believe in an aggressive attitude toward Russia, were spotted, and promoted -- young men such as John Foster Dulles and Dean Rusk. George Kennan, then in the American Embassy in Moscow, was discovered after he sent a perfervid 8,000 word telegram back to Washington. “We have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with U.S. there can be no permanent modus vivendi, that it is desirable and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be disrupted, our traditional way of life be destroyed, the international authority of our state be broken.” Mee mentions that, in his memoirs, Kennan says that he now looks back on his cable ‘with horrified amusement’. “At the time, however, he was ideal for Truman’s use, and he was recalled from Moscow and made chairman of the State Department’s Policy Planning Committee, or as the New York Times caIled him, ‘America’s global planner’.”   THE EGGHEADS Critics of the new Cold War foreign policy quickly found a nickname for its architects, “the eggheads”. Like George Kennan, they were liberal intellectuals, often prematurely bald, and unanimous in their dislike of the American people, whom they hated and feared, and their Constitution . Their goal, which they now seem to have achieved, was to liberate the federal government, which Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers had written to “bind down the government with the chains of the Constitution ”. While ostensibly following an “anti-Communist” policy, the eggheads never forswore their dedication to Marxism, and its monolithic state."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"During the four decades of the Cold War, Hollywood, which never failed to bolster the goals of the Cold War architects, reserved its bitter scorn for “red-blooded Americans” who stood for flag and country. While forbearing from ever presenting lifelong Communists in a deprecating way, Hollywood made films deriding “anti-Communists” as flagwaving American Legion boobs, a stance which it continues to this day. If any one of the eggheads and their Hollywood lackeys were to be called a “patriot”, they would be overcome with shame. A PHONY WAR During most of its history, the Cold War was a propaganda war, in which the opponents hurled invectives at each other. However, the military-industrial complex cannot make billions of dollars from propaganda; there had to be occasions of real shooting. We endured the Korean War and the Vietnam War, with hundreds of thousands of casualties, while Soviet Russia did not lose a man in either war. Both Russia and the United States were careful to have the scenes of battle take place thousands of miles from their own lands, in poverty-stricken countries such as Korea and Vietnam. We had the Cuban missile crisis, a soap opera in which the media convinced Americans that they had been on the brink of atomic destruction, being saved just before the bombs were launched by the “incredible diplomatic skills” of John F. Kennedy and Khrushchev, neither of whom before or after this crisis had ever shown the slightest skill at diplomacy. The Berlin Wall was built, to prevent all of its population from fleeing the desolation of Communist East Germany. The eggheads greeted the Berlin Wall with praise. President John F. Kennedy made a special trip to Germany to put his seal of approval on the Berlin Wall, and to reassure the Communists that the United States would not remove it. And we never did. It was the Germans themselves, driven beyond endurance, who ripped it down, much to the consternation of our eggheads in Washington. A METEORIC CAREER Although few Americans recognize the name of George Kennan, he not only was the source of the nickname “egghead”, he also was the bureaucrat entrusted with the maintenance of the Cold War in Washington for many years. He was named after his uncle, George Kennan, who spent many years travelling in Czarist Russia on “missionary work” for the world Communist movement. He was entrusted with many millions of dollars by Jacob Schiff, known as “A Prince in Israel”, who was born in the Rothschild house in Frankfurt, and who, according to his grandson, John Schiff, had spent twenty-two-million dollars of his personal funds to bring about the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Most of this money was spent on revolutionary propaganda, which Kennan, with journalistic credentials, distributed throughout Russia. Some historians credit George Kennan as the pivotal force in the Bolshevik Revolution, pointing out that it was his distributing of thousands of revolutionary leaflets to officers in the Czar’s Army which turned them against the regime and led to the downfall of the Czar. George Kennan also worked with Jacob Schiff in financing Japan in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. The Japanese government decorated Kennan with the Cold War Medal, and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the Order of the Sacred Treasure. ( The World Order , by Eustace MuIIins, p. 64). Schiff instigated this war to strike a blow against the alleged oppression of Jews in Russia, and to create a governmental crisis by which the Communists could seize power. The “1905 Revolution” failed miserably; the Communists had to wait twelve more years, with Schiff’s continued support, before they could seize power. A REMARKABLE HERITAGE To those who have studied the history of the twentieth century, it is not at all paradoxical that the American government should have entrusted its foreign policy towards Russia to someone named after the man who is credited with bringing about the Bolshevik Revolution. When Franklin D. Roosevelt, repaying Communist support which gave him victory in his presidential race against Herbert Hoover, promptly extended diplomatic recognition to Stalin, it was George Kennan who was chosen to accompany Ambassador William Bullitt to to reopen the American Embassy. It was George Kennan who wrote the notorious 8,000-word “long telegram” sent from Moscow to Washington on Dec. 22, 1946, where, as he points out, it caused a sensation, and led to his being summoned back to Washington to head the newly created post of head of Policy Planning. Kennan states in his memoirs that he had the only office directly adjoining the office of Secretary of State General George Marshall, and that it was he, Kennan, who actually drafted the text of the Marshall Plan.  THE POLICY OF “CONTAINMENT” However, it is as “X”, the anonymous author of an article which appeared in the July, 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs , the official publication of the Council on Foreign Relations, titled “The Sources of Soviet Conduct”, that George Kennan continues to be remembered in Washington. This article laid down the principle of “containment” which was to be official U.S. policy towards Russia for the remainder of the Cold War. No wonder the New York Times called Kennan “America’s global planner”. Henry Kissinger, who inherited the Kennan policy of the Cold War, wrote in White House Years , p. 135, that “George Kennan came as close to authoring the diplomatic doctrine of his era as any diplomat in our history.” Paul Kennedy, in The Rise and Full of the Great Powers , defined the “policy of containment” as follows: “The view from Washington was that a master plan for world Communist domination was unfolding and needed to be ‘contained’.” Walter Lippmann, who was a one-man think tank in Washington for fifty years, and an adviser to many Presidents, adopted Kennan’s policy in his influential The Cold War; a Study in United States Foreign Policy , as America’s senior elder statesman. Kennan’s “containment” policy was just that; that the Soviet Union and world Communism would be contained, but never openly challenged or fought against. It was a permanent guarantee that the captive nations of Eastern Europe, which had been delivered to Stalin by Roosevelt, Churchill and Alger Hiss at Yalta, would never be liberated from Communism."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"An organization championing the captive nations was for many years the most hated and derided group in Washington. Composed of a few Congressmen from Chicago and Cleveland who had strong ethnic backing from Poles, Czechs and other Eastern Europe countries, it was a political embarrassment for many years to the oligarchs of the Cold War. THE MEN BEHIND CONTAINMENT In his memoirs, Kennan mentions that one of the principal sponsors of his containment policy was then-Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, who later, as Secretary of Defense, became one of a long list of “Washington suicides”, a special category ala Vince Foster. Although published in Foreign Affairs , a magazine read only by the Elite, it was quickly taken up by Arthur Krock of the New York Times , the most influential journalist in Washington. He reprinted the article in the New York Times , describing it as the “most important foreign relations document of the century”. A shorter version of the containment article was then published in Life magazine. It had now inundated the country. Kennan states in his memoirs, “I emphatically deny the paternity of any efforts to invoke the doctrine of containment today.” He downplays both the “long telegram” and the article by “X”, claiming that they have been “misunderstood”. He modestly ignores the fact that he laid down the policy which our government has followed for forty years. His reward was a post as professor at the elite think tank in Princeton, the Institute for Advanced Study, where he has worked since 1950, with interim appointments as Ambassador to Russia and to Yugoslavia. He also was awarded the Albert Einstein Peace Prize, presumably for avoiding a Third World War by his policy of containment (my studies have shown that a Third World War between Russia and the United States was never seriously considered by anyone in authority). It was only a “War Game”. TECHNIQUES OF THE COLD WAR The government propaganda techniques by which the American people were terrorized for some forty years began with the dire threat of nuclear annihilation. School children went through daily drills of falling to the floor in terror of the atomic bomb which would destroy their school. Their parents built backyard “bomb shelters” stocked with food and water. Because “scientific studies” showed that the radiation peril would last for at least five hundred years, the survivors apparently expected to spend that much time in their shelters. Nationwide philosophical debates ensued as to whether the survivors, huddled in their shelters after the blast, should open the door to neighbors or to “minorities” who had neglected to build bomb shelters, or whether they should shoot those who battered down the doors to get food. Hollywood loyally produced many movies about the coming atomic debacle, such as Dr. Strangelove , in which insane fascists were determined to use the bomb to destroy the civilized world; War Games , in which a mad computer tried to trick the United States and Russia into destroying each other; and a steady stream of films depicting “Bette Davises” as little old librarians who were determined that students should be allowed to read the works of Karl Marx. THE CIA RIDES TO THE RESCUE"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"After years of exposure to the imminent threat of being vaporized in an atomic blast, Americans began to ignore the threat; many of them bulldozed their bomb shelters into swimming pools. It was obvious to our masters that new techniques of terror had to be developed. The Central Intelligence Agency now became the vehicle of mass terrorism. It became known as “the Company” under the leadership of stock promoter Bill Casey. He became highly skilled at peddling alarming statistics about the threat of Communism to Congress, who hastily voted vast increases in the “defense” budget. The oligarchs abandoned the now worn out doctrine of nuclear annihilation. There would be no need to spend two-hundred-and-fifty-billion dollars a year on tanks, guns and airplanes if they were all to be vaporized by a single bomb. The defense budget had been brought from a low of $13 billion in 1947 to a continuous budget in the hundreds of billions. With its top secret budget of hundreds of millions of dollars a year, never to be examined by anyone, the CIA sent its own James Bonds all over the world usually to attack and overthrow “anti- Communist” governments and “dictators” such as Ferdinand Marcos, who had been indiscreet in their denunciations of Communism. The CIA hired hundreds of journalists to write books and articles promoting its version of the Cold War, always at the highest prevailing rates. EFFECTS OF THE COLD WAR The effect on both Russia and the United States of the Cold War conspirators has been devastating. Russia’s economy is in a state of collapse, with no improvement in sight. The United States has been looted; its infrastructure, its roads, bridges and other assets need many billions in immediate repair. We have the $5 trillion Cold War debt; but the most destructive effect on our nation is the Cold War’s effect on our morality, The years of being terrorized by the atomic threat had a very destructive effect on morality. If we were to be vaporized at any time, it seemed worthwhile to seize the moment, to take pleasure, money and any other rewards while they were available, without thought for the consequences, since there would be no consequences. We have now endured the effects of this poisonous doctrine for several generations. The effect of the CIA propaganda lies about the “great Soviet Union” which might take over the world at any moment has been equally destructive. When conservative economist Paul Craig Roberts landed in Moscow during the height of the CIA propaganda campaign, he was stunned to find that Soviet Russia had “a Third World economy”. I had proved in my writings that the United States taxpayer had been subsidizing the Soviet Union since 1917. In fact, Americans have been living a lie for four decades, the lie that we were in dire peril from “the Communist threat”. This lie has been demoralizing; it has placed us on the brink of bankruptcy; and it poses the challenge to us: When are we going to get rid of our Cold War conspirators? They must pay the price for the destruction they have wrought on our nation. We must drive them out of every office; bring them to trial for their high treason; and restore the Republic which our Founding Fathers bequeathed to us. It is this task -- not sad jokes about “balancing the budget” -- which will determine whether this nation will survive to the twenty-first century."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"************************************************ 16.) Zionism: The Terrible Secret Of The Cold War 06/16/96 Although a “Cold War” is defined by Webster as a “conflict between two nations by means of power politics short of violence,” the fact is that the Cold War between Russia and the United States, declared in 1946 and officially ended in 1990 by a formal declaration of friendship and a treaty calling for arms reduction, the forty-four years of the Cold War was replete with war and revolution throughout the world. We had police actions such as the Korean and Vietnam Wars, “brushfire wars”, and many other instances of armed conflict between nations, such as the ongoing Arab-Israeli wars. It is a triumph of Newspeak and mind control that we now look upon this forty-four year period of conflict as a time in which we were spared the ravages of war. It is also a triumph of the world Zionist movement, which was the driving force behind the many conflicts which marked the Cold War years. The Cold War was never a bitter and relentless struggle between the irreconcilable forces of capitalism and Communism; in fact, the leading protagonists, the United States and Russia, were both governed by the principles of Karl Marx, the founder of the world Communist movement. Both nations had enacted into law the principles of the Commmunist Manifesto of 1848, including the progressive income tax, a central bank, and compulsory public (not private or religious) education. The tragedy of the Cold War is that it was an artificial conflict, created by the world Zionist movement solely to ensure a continuous flow of military supplies from the United States to Israel. These supplies were essential to the instant survival of Israel and to its expansionist plans in the Middle East. It is amazing that this obvious fact of history is stated here for the first time by anyone. One of the principal figures since the outset of the Cold War, James V. Forrestal, the nation’s first Secretary of Defense, was ritually sacrificed by the Israelis when he balked at stripping the United States of its arsenal and sending it to Israel. The press featured stories that he was “mentally unstable”, preparing the public for his “suicide”. His Successor, Robert A. Lovett, of the firm of Brown Brothers Harriman, quickly acceded to any and all requests from the Israeli government. Yet Forrestal’s death should have been the tipoff that the “Cold War” was from its outset a Zionist apparatchnik operation. After all, Forrestal himself had commissioned George Kennan to author the “containment plan” which duly appeared in Foreign Affairs , the official publication of the Council on Foreign Relations, and which became the operating program for more than forty years of the Cold War. CHURCHILL’S CONFESSION"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Zionist direction of the Cold War was also apparent in the personage who was chosen to officially launch it. Winston Churchill, an unemployed politician in England, was chosen for this honor because of his flagrant but usually concealed Zionist sympathies. When he declared the Cold War to be in effect, in his speech at Fulton College, in Missouri, on March 5, 1946, he was speaking for the Zionist cause. Because Churchill was too clever to openly state his longstanding Zionist commitment, in fifty years of research, I have found only one reference to this central fact of his career. Abba Eban, for many years the Israeli Ambassador to Washington, and one of the creators of the State of Israel, reveals in his autobiography, Personal Witness: Israel Through My Eyes , Putnams, New York 1992, quotes Churchill as jubilantly referring to “our Zionist cause”. On page 62, Eban tells us that “Churchill had appointed a Cabinet committee under the chairmanship of Herbert Morrison producing a proposal for the establishment of a Jewish state by 1944. If this initiative had been adopted by the British Cabinet, World War II would have ended for Zionism as triumphantly as had World War I. Churchill was so jubilant that he called Weizmann (Chaim Weizmann, founder of Israel) to a meeting on Nov. 2, 1944 and said triumphantly, ‘Our Zionist cause is going well. Moyne is now on our side.’ \" Note that Churchill, the Prime Minister of England, refers “jubilantly” to “our Zionist cause”. This is the sole reference in Churchillian literature to this commitment. In many volumes of history and millions of words written by Churchill, he never once reveals this commitment. However, it was implicit in his public career after 1932. Bankrupt, he had been recruited by Bernard Baruch to ensure a Second World War. GERMANY DELENDA EST In 1938, again facing bankruptcy, Churchill received a “loan” of 150,000 pounds (ten million in today’s dollars) from Zionist banker Henry Strakosch, who then became his personal adviser. Strakosch orchestrated Churchill’s program, “ Germany delenda est ”, “Germany must be destroyed”. With the backing of the House of Rothschild, Churchill single-handedly made the Second World War inevitable. After launching World War II, he rejected peace overtures from Germany in 1940 and 1941, including the famous “peace flight” of Rudolf Hess, who came as Adolf Hitler’s personal emissary to England to persuade the British Goverment to join him in a crusade against Communism. Hess was imprisoned, and Churchill became Stalin’s loyal ally. REFUSAL TO FACE REALITY It is indicative of the refusal of the American people to face reality that they refuse to acknowledge that the man who plunged us into the Second World War and ensured the establishment of the State of Israel, then launched the forty-four year Cold War to maintain the United States as a heavily armed world power which could siphon off much of its military armaments to the State of Israel to back Israel’s war against her Arab neighbors in the Middle East. In my researches, I plowed through dozens of reference works to find the origin of the term, “Cold War”. I found it, not in Webster’s or the Oxford English dictionary, but in an obscure work, DICTIONARY OF TWENTIETH CENTURY ALLUSIONS , by Cohn and Lass. These scholars reveal that the term “Cold War” originated"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"as a phrase written by Herbert Bayard Swope, publicist for Bernard Baruch, in 1946 for a speech by Baruch. Thus the term was invented by a Jewish writer for a Jewish financier and politician, both ardent Zionists. In 1946, Winston Churchill divided the civilized world into two warring spheres, Russia and the United States, for the sole purpose of guaranteeing his Zionist cohorts an unending supply of weaponry from the American taxpayers. The Grand Design of Churchill’s invention was soon bolstered by an elaborate world-wide system of political and military alliances who aligned with either side. We set up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, which soon became the ruling power in Washington. It operated from Brussels under the leadership of Lord Carrington, a Rothschild relative, who recently presided over the latest meeting of the Bilderberg group in Canada. He is also the partner of Henry Kissinger in a wheeling-and-dealing international firm, Kissinger Associates. We also set up the South Atlantic Treaty Organization, SATO, while the Russians organized the Warsaw Pact among the Communist nations whom it controlled. To make the world picture complete, undeveloped poor nations who could not afford the massive military expenditures necessary to play a role in these large mythical and never-to-be-deployed organizations, were relegated to a cast-off status as “Third World” nations, who could be courted by either of the Cold War opponents. ARAB TREACHERY The most astounding development of the Cold War was the assignment of the Arab nations to Moscow. Henceforth, they were enrolled among the Communist-influenced bloc of nations, despite the fact that they were devoutly anti-Communist, and that members of the Communist Party face execution in any Arab country. The raison d’etre behind this amazing development was that the Jews had invaded and seized an Arab nation, Palestine, and that all devout Moslems must now come to the aid of their religious brethren. The Soviet Union would be the official backer of the Arab nations, and the United States would officially back the State of Israel. There now followed a series of Arab-Israeli wars. The Soviet Union provided the Arab arteries with malfunctioning equipment, making it certain that the Arabs were always defeated, and that Israel emerged a stronger and more confident presence in the Middle East. The Arabs never seemed to catch on. Of course their leaders were controlled by Washington, which in turn was controlled by Tel Aviv. The outcome could not have surprised anyone who could see what was really going on. During the early years of the Cold War, I believed, as did most Americans, that Communism and the Soviet Union was the enemy. I was extremely anti-cornmunist and anti-Soviet, as were all of my colleagues. Inevitably, we became anti-Zionist, because, as Congressman Rankin pointed out on the floor of the House of Representatives “Ninety-five per cent of American Communists are Jewish.” The Jews, as Stalin came to realize shortly before his untimely death, at the hands of a group of Jewish physicians, that Jews could never be pro-Communist, or pro-Russian, because their deeply held religious commitment was to the nation of Israel."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"By the early 1950s, I was speaking and writing prolifically on the Zionist apparat in the United States and how it controlled the Washington government. I naively supposed that the Arab nations, with their untold billions of oil revenues, mostly flowing from the United States, would send funds to back my exposés of Zionism, and, for the expenditure of a few thousand doIlars, alert the American people to the presence of the deadly enemy in their midst. I sent copies of these works, with accompanying letters, to the various Arab embassies in Washington. I never received any reply. At that time, I did not know, as has been subsequently revealed, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Anti- Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, sometimes separately and sometimes jointly, routinely performed “black bag” entries into the Arab embassies and photocopied all of their papers. My letters went to the ADL offices in New York. Because of this control, neither I nor anyone who worked to combat Zionist subversion in the United States, ever received one cent from any Arab source. Even the Arabs in the United States, many of whom had become millionaire businessmen, did not dare contribute anything to this work. Their names would promptly be reported to the ADL, and their businesses would be destroyed. Thus the Arabs were powerless to counteract Zionist activities in the United States. Had they been able to launch a counter-offensive here, the specter of Zionism could have been defeated. ZIONIST ATROCITIES Of the many exposés documenting Israel’s reign of terror in the Middle East, one of the most shocking is Ralph Schoenman’s THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF ZIONISM (Veritas Press, Santa Barbara, CA). Schoenman points out that the Zionist slanders of the Arabs as barbarians is countermanded by the fact that “During the Dark Ages in Europe, mathematics and philosophy were preserved by Arab scholars. The Zionist movement subdued Palestine and assaulted its culture with a relentless barbarity shocking even to those familiar with the cruel annals of colonial conquest.” Schoenman points out (p.1) “The Dec; 21, 1987 general strike of the Palestine community. The Israeli response to the uprising was brutal. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the use of tanks, armored vehicles and automatic rifles against an unarmed population. The act of brutality which most inflamed the Palestinian people was the army seizure of the wounded from hospital beds. Palestinian children seeking powdered milk at United Nations depots were shot at and beaten with sticks.\" All of these atrocities were paid for by the American taxpayer. These atrocities were justified by Israel on the grounds that they had suffered in the Holocaust. But the Palestinian children whom they massacred had taken no part in the Holocaust. Schoenman points out (p. 16) “the myth that Zionism is the moral legatee of the victims of the Holocaust. The bitter and cruel irony of this false claim is that the Zionist movement itself actively colluded with Nazism from its inception. Mussolini set up squadrons of the Revisionist Zionist Youth movement, Betar, in black shorts in emulation of his own Fascist bands. When Menachem Begin became chief of Betar, he preferred the brown shirts of the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Hitler gangs, a uniform which Begin and Betar wore to all meetings, at which they greeted each other with the fascist salute. In 1937, the Labor “socialist” Zionist militia, the Haganah, founded by Jabotinsky, sent an agent, Feivel Folkes, to Berlin offering to spy for the S.S. Security Service in exchange for the release of Jewish wealth for Zionist colonization. Adolf Eichmann was invited to Palestine as the guest of the Haganah. S.S. General Kurt Becher was appointed Commissar of all Nazi concentration camps by Heinrich Himmler. He was never tried, and after the war headed up the sale of wheat to Israel. His corporation, the Cologne-Handel Gesellschaft, did extensive business with the Israeli government.” (P. 94). ALWAYS A MINORITY Although the Zionists claimed that God had promised them Palestine in an unbreakable covenant, they never offered any explanation of the fact that they had always been a minority there. They had never engaged in business or agriculture until the Rothschilds financed them in the late nineteenth century. One source, ISRAEL: HISTORY UNTIL 1880 (p. 230): “At that time (the 19th century) the Jews lived mainly on charity received from abroad.” Not until they seized the farms and businesses of the native Arab population did they engage in commerce with their stolen goods. The most authoritative documentation of the Zionist presence in Palestine is found in Israel by Time Life Books, 1985. On p.24 we find that “At the beginning of 1948, when Independence was declared, the Jewish population of Palestine was estimated at six hundred thousand; the non-Jewish (Arab) population of Palestine on the eve of Independence was about 1,800,000. ” At the time of the 1948 Israeli seizure of Palestine, the Zionists were a minority, comprising one third of the total population! How did they succeed against vastly greater numbers? The answer, in one word, is “terrorism”. Israel is the only nation in the world founded exclusively on terrorist acts. Abba Eban points out in Personal Witness that Lord Moyne, who was sympathetic to the Zionist cause, was murdered by Lechi, a splinter group of Menachem Begin’s Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist gang. He was murdered in Cairo in 1944. Count Bernadotte, then appointed U.N. negotiator in Palestine, was also murdered by Lechi. The Zionists blew up the King David Hotel, kidnapped and tortured British soldiers before murdering them, and then booby- trapped their bodies, killing more British who sought only to give their comrades Christian burial. These atrocities caused anti-Jewish riots in London, which were quickly put down by the British Government. NE0-CONSERVATIVE FRONT IN THE U.S. To prevent the American people from learning about Zionist atrocities against the Arab peoples, the Zionists set up a nationwide front in the United States, which called itself “the neo-conservative” movement headed by Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary , the magazine published by the American Jewish Committee in New York, the Neo- Conservatives were actually disgruntled Jewish Socialists who had left the Communist Party after Stalin ordered the murder of Leon Trotsky. The Trotskyite Communists concealed their ties to the Communist Party, and masqueraded as \"Conservatives” in the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"United States. Althougth Commentary was their principal outlet, they also founded many other publications, such as National Review, and one of their leaders, Martin Peretz, persuaded the heiress to the Singer sewing machine fortune to abandon her husband. He then married her, and used her money to buy the New Republic , which also became a Zionist propaganda operation. However, the principal Zionist propagandists in the United States remained the major networks, and the Jewish-owned newspapers, such as Sulzberger’s New York Times , and the Meyer family’s Washington Post . ZIONISM AND THE CIA A principal weapon of the Zionists in the United States was the CIA. Bob Woodward, in Veil; The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-87 notes on p. 161, “The CIA had secret PLO sources that at times provided operational details about PLO attacks in Israel.” The result was that the CIA turned this information over to Mossad, which then wiped out the PLO attackers. Veil continues, “Before 1974, the celebrated CIA chief of counterintelligence, James Jesus Angleton, had run the Israeli desk at the agency, keeping vital information from the Middle East operations people and analysts. Even after Angleton was fired, all lsraeli intelligence was viewed for years as little more than a Mossad press release, designed to serve Israel’s political goals.” On p. 355, Woodward informs us that “Casey (William Casey, head of the CIA) had leverage with Israel. He had given the Israelis broader access to U.S. satellite reconnaisance photos than they had previously enjoyed.” The close collaboration between the CIA and Israel was duly praised by the neo- conservatives, who filled the pages of their publications with paeans in praise of their favorite stooges, notably Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations, and Margaret Thatcher, Conservative Prime Minister of England. When he retired from the editorship of Commentary in 1996, Norman Podhoretz published a book, NeoConservatism; A Eulogy , congratulating himself on a job well done. He boasts that “Neoconservatism was created to help Israel take advantage of the Cold War. Our work is now done.” This is a frank admission that the mythical “Cold War” was never anything but a Zionist operation. Now that this “war” is over, Neoconservatism has no further mission in the United States. Nevertheless, it will probably continue as a useful propaganda outlet for Israel. MARGARET THATCHER Today, Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of England, is paid a handsome lecture fee of $100,000 per speech in the United States. This is a payoff from the State of Israel. Although she never reveals her Zionist sympathies in these speeches, she did expose the Zionist bias of her administration when her mentor, Sir Keith Joseph, recently died in England. In her eulogy to him, she declared that he had been the sole architect of her entire administration. She did not add that he was the son of Sir Abraham Joseph, who had been"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"the principal contractor for the House of Rothschild’s many commercial developments in England, amassing a large fortune for himself, which allowed his son to devote his time to “public service”. Margaret Thatcher’s speech to the Congress of Prague was recently reprinted in the Wall Street Journal , on the op-ed page, May 14, 1996. Under the heading, “The West After the Cold War”, Thatcher cites the Congress of Vienna in 1815, but fails to mention that at this Congress, to celebrate their victory over Napoleon, the Rothschilds asserted their mastery over Europe. [See The World Order by Eustace Mullins.] Her description of the Cold War, which she genuinely seems to miss, noted “First of all, there was a kind of unholy symmetry in international affairs, created by a balance of terror. The breakdown of Soviet power brought that discpline to an end.” Here again we find an open admission that the governments of the Free World, manipulated by the Zionists, kept their citizens terrified, in order to tax them for armaments for Israel. It is now estimated that during the Cold War, no less than ten per cent of the annual defense budget of the United States, ranging from ten billion to twenty-five billion a year, was secretly siphoned off to Israel. Most of these “donations” were entered in the records as going to other recipients, most of whom transhipped them directly to Israel. Margaret Thatcher was openly regarded with contempt in England because of her subservience to Israel. In her speech to the Congress of Prague she longs, for “that discipline” of the Cold War on which she and her American counterparts founded their long and lucrative carerrs. The Zionists are the masters of terrorism; how they have delighted in terrorizing the people of England and the United States during the long decades of the Cold War. Despite her success in implementing the program of the house of Rothschild in England, Margaret Thatcher’s long reign as Prime Minister won her few friends there. She was recently memorialized by Thedore Dalrymple in the Spectator , Feb 10, 1996. He says that Margatet Thatcher “had rather less success with her own country, of course, which is just as she found it; grey and grubby, supporting an atrociously dressed population with an insatiable appetite for the most footling entertainments.” On a recent visit to London, I was shocked by the drabness of this Zionist-ruled country, which seemed distinctly Third World in the shabby clothing, rundown infrastructure, and tired demeanour of its people. MINISTRY OF FEAR Throughout the Cold War, the governments of England and the United States functioned as a Ministry of Fear for their luckless citizens, constantly terrifying them with horror stories of the terrible fate which awaited them if they did not continue to turn over most of their earnings to the “government”, which, of course, was the “Zionist Occupation Government” or ZOG as it is more popularly known. While the Thatchers and the Kennans long for the “good old days” of universal terror, we are reminded by a series of recent deaths that the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"terrorism of the Cold War is still claiming its victims. The unexplained death of Vincent Foster, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Boorda, and former CIA head William Colby remind us that Zionist terrorism is still very much with us. Vincent Foster’s “suicide” brought revelations that he had amassed millions of dollars in payoffs for his espionage work for the State of Israel, now secreted in Swiss bank accounts; Ron Brown’s fortuitous demise removed a principal threat to Bill Clinton’s reelection campaign. Sean Wilentz hailed him in the April 15, 1996 New Yorker as “The Fixer as Statesman” describing Brown as “Silky, shrewd, and extremely self-confident, Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown was one of the premier Washington fixers of the modern era.” Wilentz reminds us that Brown was the personal protege of Vernon Jordan, Washington’s leading black insider, who recently appeared as a principal at the Bilderberger Conference in Canada, and that Brown had been chief aide to Senator Teddy Kennedy in Washington. Wilentz reminds us that Brown “brokered billions of dollars worth of foreign deals for American companies.” This was precisely the basis for the many federal investigations into his activities, which have now been closed STORMY WEATHER When the news came that Ron Brown’s plane had crashed in Yugoslavia on April 3, 1996, Hillary Clinton rushed to explain in her newspaper column that the crash had been caused by “a violent rainstorm”. Both Time and Newsweek described it as “the worst storm of the decade”. These Establishment claims were immediately countermanded by Aviation Week , which denied that there had been a violent rainstorm. On June 7, 1996, Maj. Gen. Charles Coolidge, president of the Air Force Investigating Committee into the Ron Brown Plane Crash, stated on C-Span that “The weather was not a substantial contributing factor in the accident.” The Air Force now attributes the crash to “pilot error”, since the pilots are unable to defend themselves. Although a stewardess, Shelly Kelly, survived the crash with minor injuries, Media Bypass states that she later died at the hospital from loss of blood, a neat three-inch incision over her femoral artery. Clinton hastily ordered the bodies of the victims to be cremated, to “sanitize the area” as was done at Waco and Oklahoma City. COLBY AND OPERATION PHOENIX Another recent victim of the Cold war is William Colby, former head of the CIA. He was found drowned near his bay hideaway, although his widow said he was in excellent health and a very good swimmer. He had left his dinner on the table in order to take a swim, no doubt being aware of admonitions not to swim immediately after eating. Disinformation is now being circulated from Washington that he was probably done in by some of the old CIA hands, who were offended by some of his remarks about the CIA in Congressional testimony. This indicates a loyalty among the members of the “Old boy” CIA network which does not exist. During his tenure in Vietnam, William Colby embarked on an ambitious program to secure for the CIA complete control of drug operations in Southeast Asia. Operation Phoenix resulted in the execution of sixty-eight thousand Vietnamese who were active in the drug trade, although the figure released by the CIA is usually only twenty thousand. In"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"retirement, Colby relaxed his personal security, ignoring the fact that some twenty-five thousand Vietnamese now live within a few miles of the CIA headquarters. Washington observers believe that the sons of some of the victims of Operation Phoenix in Vietnam had stalked Colby for months, biding their time until they could dispose of him at their leisure. Certainly this is much more logical than the mythical “loyalty” of former CIA officials. BOORDA’S SUICIDE The reputed suicide of Admiral Jeremy M. (Mike) Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations, shocked all of those who believe in the American dream. The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, who owned the only dress shop in the little town of Momence, Illinois, Boorda’s rise from enlisted man to Admiral, to the most important job in the Navy, CNO, had been meteoric. This was the more striking because, with his five-foot-four-inch stature, he was hardly a commanding military presence. In fact, his meteoric rise may have been due more to his connections than to his ability, as we shall presently explain. The explanation of this suicide by President Clinton and other saddened Washington admirers of Admiral Boorda was that he had worn some combat decorations which he may not have been entitled to display. However, Naval authorities have issued conflicting reports as to whether he had been in violation of any rules about the V stars displayed on his ribbons. In any case, his sudden suicide because of the question raised indicates a sensitivity which had been remarkably lacking in his personality. The Navy is not a place for shrinking violets, and delicate pansies do not thrive in the harsh atmosphere which is traditional aboard ship. LOYALTY TO ISRAEL As a lifelong Zionist, Admiral Boorda hated the traditional office corps of the United States Navy, with its code of gentlemanly conduct and its hallowed Annapolis esprit de corps of the Naval Academy. As Chief of Naval Operations, he launched a campaign of sabotage against the Navy, seeking to destroy its officer corps. As one who sought to demoralize the military establishment, he was greatly admired by President Clinton and his White House crew of fanatical Zionists. However, as CRIMINAL POLITICS points out (May 1996) “He was universally hated among the officer corps.” Had they known more about his background, the officer corps would have hated him even more. Admiral Boorda “committed suicide” a few minutes before he was to be interviewed by a Newsweek correspondent. He had been tipped off that he would be asked two questions: Did he know Jonathan Jay Pollard? And, was he Pollard’s “handler” at the Navy Department? POLLARD: MASTER SPY Jonathan Jay Pollard fled arrest by the FBI on December 12, 1985. He was followed to the Israeli Embassy in Washington where, after hasty communication with Tel Aviv, he was denied asylum. Israel was not about to endanger its “special relationship” with the United"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"States to the tune of many billions a year in “aid”. Pollard was then arrested by the FBI on charges of selling official United States codes to Israel for $50,000. These codes were worth literally billions of dollars; they were cheap at $50,000. They included many Top Secret codes, including SIGINT and IMINT, the key to our entire national defense strategy. Pollard was the son of Morris Pollard, a famous cancer-researcher at the University of Notre Dame. He had been privy to the innermost secrets of the Department of the Navy, all of which he considered legitimate goods for sale. His wife was also charged with possession of confidential documents. Although it was never brought out at his trial, Pollard was a member of a twenty-eight man Israeli spy ring in the Navy Department called “nesher” (Hebrew for ‘eagle’). This cell was a spinoff of the nesher cell at the Department of Justice which had been set up by Philip Klutznick in 1936 and which runs the entire Dept. of Justice. Most government departments in Washington subsequently set up nesher cells, but the Navy Department, thanks to Pollard’s talent for intrigue, soon gained access to our most important defense secrets. During the heyday of Pollard’s espionage, Mike Boorda had risen rapidly in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. His position was ideal for the master of a spy ring. He could protect his operatives, and move them up to even more sensitive positions. This nesher cell orchestrated the “Tailhook” scandal to demoralize the entire U.S. Navy. In what proved to be a masterful coverup, Pollard never exposed any of his fellow- conspirators during his trial. He contended that he had acted alone, which was manifestly impossible, as every door at the Navy Department had been opened to him by higher-ups, such as a high offical in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. Pollard was sentenced to life without parole. He is regarded in Israel as a national hero, and Washington insiders state that Clinton had definitely agreed to pardon Pollard after the November elections. THE NEWSWEEK ORDEAL The Establishment-approved version of Admiral Boorda’s suicide is that he could not face being asked about the decorations he had worn, and that suicide was the only way out. This ignored the fact that Boorda had removed the decorations months before, when a question was raised about them, and that he was not wearing them. The inside story is that although Boorda had been tipped off that he would be asked about the Pollard association, he had only to deny it, and it would probably not appear in the printed interview. However, Mossad, informed of the approaching interview, decided that it would cancel Clinton’s prospective pardon of Pollard if the question was raised at all. In accordance with their policy of “minimizing risks”, Tel Aviv ordered that the interview not take place. A Mossad operative followed Boorda, shot him in the chest, and went on his way. Of the various “suicides”, also known as “Washington suicides” which have taken place in Washington, nearly all of them have had a Zionist connection. The Zionists believe in “cleaning the slate”. A serious problem must be disposed of quickly and cleanly. A suicide is the accepted solution. And of them all, Boorda’s is the most unbelievable. We are asked to accept that Boorda could not face a simple question, “Why did you take off the decorations?“, and that he chose to shoot himself in the chest, a very rare occurrence in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"suicide. Clinton’s crocodile tears for his departed hero mingle with his tears for the forty- two other associates who have departed this vale of tears during his colorful political career. There will be more in the future.   MASS MURDER The forty-four years of the Cold War were years of unrelieved horror, marked by repeated massacres of helpless men and children, and by the annual ingathering of more and more of the world’s goods into Zionists’ rapacious hands. The tragedy of the Cold War is not merely that we do not understand it; we have learned nothing from it. We are ready for a new Cold War to terrorize us, so that we can continue to hand over our possessions to the Zionists. Tel Aviv has decreed that the 1996 elections shall be fought solely on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, welfare, Medicare, and balancing the budget. This ignores all of the real issues facing the American people. Most important, it ignores the religious issue. The Zionists have a religious mission: to make Israel, a theocracy, the ruler of the world. GOD’S WILL We need to face the basic issue, that God did not send His Only Son to Earth to be crucified on the Cross at the demand of mocking Jews, or to have His People enslaved forever by the Jews. Our enslavement by the Jews remains a daily insult to God. It is a mockery of God’s Purpose for us. Christ was sent to us as our only opportunity for redemption. If we continue to reject God’s offer, our punishment will not only be continued slavery, but punishments so terrible we cannot imagine them. Today, Edgar Bronfman, the King of the Jews, president of the World Jewish Congress, stands astride the world as Satan’s Consul, the new King Herod. Soon he will demand the slaughter of our firstborn sons. We can continue to be enslaved by liquor smugglers and drug dealers only if we wish to continue to insult God. God is not mocked. He is sad, because he wanted so much for us, and we have rejected Him. The horrors of the Cold War are but a harbinger of the terrible fate which awaits us here on Earth. But we still have a chance. We can act immediately to punish the Cold War conspirators. We can end the mockery of God which the presence of the State of Israel flaunts in His face. And, at long last, we can accept God’s Plan for His People on Earth. Or we can go on, in misery, ignorance, and sloth, until death ends our failure here. You must choose for yourself, as this too is part of God’s Plan for us. Seize the day! ************************************************ 17.) Clinton: The End Is Near?"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"07/9/96 Many Washington insiders are aware that the current FBI scandals involving illegal acquisition of personal FBI files on almost one thousand Republican Party opponents by Bill Clinton is certain to ring down the final curtain on the Bill and Hillary show. Always an outsider, Clinton failed to realize that when you are in Washington, you don’t mess with the FBI. Americans outside the Beltway may find it difficult to grasp the seriousness of this latest imbroglio. The Clintons apparently survived the financial scandals of their Whitewater involvement because the public became confused about the long-running investigation and what it actually proved. It did not damage the Clintons because the central figure, White House lawyer Vince Foster, was removed before the story broke, one of the most convenient of the in-house “suicides” which have marked the Clinton Presidency. ROOTS OF GOVERNMENT The FBI scandal, on the other hand, shakes the very foundations of the present federal government. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the government’s police force. They are the hitmen who destroy any opposition. The FBI files have always been the basis of the entire government operation. It is the constant fear of exposure by revelations of these files that keeps both citizens and bureaucrats in line. These are known as “raw files” meaning that nothing in the FBI files has been subjected to any legal challenges or verification of any kind. They are largely rumors and gossip about sex scandals, fraud, conspiracy and treason, all of which would incur lengthy prison sentences if prosecuted. This dangerous information requires severe restrictions in the handling of FBI files. When I applied for my personal file from the FBI through the Freedom of Information Act in 1978, the FBI notified me that I had a file of more than eight hundred pages, which I subsequently found was ten times the size of the FBI file which was maintained on John Dillinger, Public Enemy No. 1 for several years. FBI officials stipulated that before my files could be released to me, I must send them a notarized signature and a statement that I really was Eustace Mullins. They had had me under daily surveillance for thirty three years, but they still were not certain as to just who I really was. I supplied the necessary document, because I was now very anxious to see what they had on me. I had never been arrested or charged with any offence, and to my reckoning they could not have very much. I was not about to find out, because, after I complied with their requirement, FBI officials continued to stall me on sending the file for three more years. I am always very reluctant to ask anyone for assistance, but I finally called upon a college classmate, Senator John Warner of Virginia, for help in getting my file. He was glad to oblige, and within a few days, the FBI delivered to my door a partial release, five hundred pages of my file. The FBI explained that they were retaining more than three hundred pages of my file, on the grounds that to release it would “endanger national security”. I appealed this ruling, but it was upheld by an executive commission of senior FBI officials. To date, I have never seen the other three hundred pages of my file. FILES OPEN TO ALL AGENCIES"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Few Americans know that their personal files are available for reading by any other government agency, on request. Jack Anderson, a Washington columnist, boasted for years that he could obtain any FBI file. The going rate was one thousand dollars per file, not as a bribe, but as a freewill offering! When President Clinton appointed a former barroom bouncer and drug user named Craig Livingstone (these were apparently his only qualifications for the job) as his White House Security Chief (reputedly on orders from Hillary Clinton: it turned out that Livingstone’s mother was one of her oldest friends, and he needed a job desperately as he had been fired from previous positions for lying to his employers) Clinton must have rejoiced that he had at last found the perfect person for the job. When Senator Joe McCarthy was in his heyday, he made headlines all over the world with his question “Who promoted Peress?” Dr. Peress was an Army medical officer who had been promoted despite grave doubts as to his loyalty to the United States and his ties to Communists. Today, the question in Washington is “Who hired Craig Livingstone?” He claims he had no idea who might have hired him for one of the most sensitive security positions in the entire United States. William Kennedy, a partner of Hillary in the Rose law firm, recently testified that he thought Vince Foster may have hired Livingstone. This was a safe bet, as Foster has been buried and cannot reply to any question from a government committee. The Washington Post reported that Livingstone had been an advance man or promoter for a viciously anti-Christian movie, The Last Temptation of Christ . This would fit the Clinton requirements for White House staff, dedicated leftwing hippies who hate Christ, the military, and the United States of America. As the Governor of a small rural state, Clinton has been accustomed to exercising total political power, a Gauleiter of an area which the rest of the country is not concerned about. When he assumed the office of the Presidency, he could think of no reason why he should not requisition the personal FBI files of his Republican opponents, to peruse them at his leisure in the White House, and to use the material in upcoming political campaigns. We might suppose that the files would contain very reliable documentation, the result of careful investigations by highly trained FBI agents, but in fact they are a mishmash of spite and innuendo, gathered by FBI agents from anyone who had cause to hate the subject of the investigation. These lurid compilations of vicious smears and rumors are duly deposited in the highly guarded files of the FBI, to remain there forever, and never to be contradicted or exposed by anyone. Such material is invaluable in the desperate infighting of a political campaign. THE STRANGE CASE OF THE ONE THOUSAND FBI FILES It is rare for any government agency to request more than a few files at a time, to review a job application, or to make a decision about a temporary employee. The White House went whole hog, requesting about one-thousand FBI files of their Republican opponents. This news was leaked to the public very gradually. At first, it was but one FBI file, the file of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Billy Dale, who had been fired from the White House Travel OffIce to make room for a Clinton cousin, at the personal insistence of Hillary. Billy Dale had been arrested and charged with embezzlement by Janet Reno, again at the personal insistence of Hillary. He was promptly acquitted by a jury, which found no evidence against him. When a government committee on oversight demanded the release of one thousand documents concerning the Billy Dale case, the White House staff refused to turn over the documents -- until they were faced with a subpoena. When the papers were received, they contained references to other FBI files requisitioned by the White House. The first count was three hundred, then four-hundred-and-eight, and finally nine-hundred-and-eight. The Washington consensus is that more than one thousand FBI files had been requisitioned by the White House. The White House requested the files by unsigned forms bearing the typed name of Bernie Nussbaum, White House counsel, who had been hired to replace the now deceased Vince Foster. Clinton immediately explained the incidents as “an innocent mistake”. His staff chimed in with well-rehearsed choruses of “bureaucratic snafu” and “honest mistake”. As one of the inquiring Congressmen pointed out, the obtaining of these files involved some forty-three separate requests, so that there would have had to be forty-three individual “honest mistakes”. Apparently there had been no “dishonest mistakes”. Compare the delivering of one thousand personal FBI files to the White House over typed signature requests with the FBI’s steadfast refusal to deliver one file, my own, to me, even with a notarized signature! Never in the history of the FBI had anyone dared to request such a horrendous quantity of the sacrosanct FBI files. J. Edgar Hoover would have thrown any such request into the wastebasket. However, he was succeeded by a series of pathetic political dupes and stooges, scraped from the bottom of the barrel in Washington, the dregs of the entire nation who now were ushered into J. Edgar Hoover’s hallowed precincts, there to squirm and dishonor themselves daily as prostitutes for ruthless political operatives such as the sleazy Bill Clinton. FREEH A TOTAL NONENTITY In choosing the present head of the FBI, Louis Freeh, President Bill Clinton knew that he had the complete stooge, a Jerry Lewis actor look-alike who would perform any silly antics and grin while doing it. Freeh willingly participated in FBI massacres of women and children, and promoted the FBI agents who had managed to exterminate the greatest numbers of helpless women and children. Now Freeh’s head is on the block. What has yet to be dealt with in the FBI files scandal is the fact that even though the White House acted illegally in requesting the files, in open violation of the Privacy Acts, the cooperating FBI officials acted even more illegally in releasing them to the mysterious forms bearing only a typed signature of an alleged White House official. Such a request in mass would have had to be brought to Freeh’s personal attention as director of the FBI, and he is the person who would ultimately have to answer if the scandal were to break, as it surely has. These files"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"could only have gone out of the J. Edgar Hoover Building after Freeh had given his personal approval.  RELIVING THE NIXON ERA At the height of the Watergate scandal, pot-smoking young Jewish lawyers at the Department of Justice held wild drug and sex parties while playing the top secret Nixon tapes in the background. Many of the parties, weeklong in nature, were moved to Greenwich Village in New York’s drug culture scene, where a party was not considered successful unless the forbidden Nixon tapes were playing in the background. Under Craig Livingstone’s aegis, as the hallowed director of security in the Clinton White House, the indecencies of the Nixon years were replayed. The FBI files of the Republican leaders were kept in an unlocked vault, with a copying machine nearby. Livingstone admitted in his testimony before Congress that he had no knowledge how many files were copied, by whom, or for what purpose, as the copying machine was set up to make no records of any kind relating to its use. WALL STREET JOURNAL COMMENTARY After Craig Livingstone’s testimony under oath before a Congressional Committee, the Wall Street Journal duly reported on its editorial page, June 27, 1996: “So control over the Clinton White House’s office of personnel security was given to Craig Livingstone, a punk, and Anthony Marceca, a political lowlife.” Congressman Floyd Flake reported that he had had an altercation with Livingstone at National Airport, during which Livingstone called Flake “a dumb-ass nigger”. The Journal observed that “no one at the White House has a clue how Craig Livingstone got this job.” Its editors note that an FBI agent detailed to the White House since 1979, Dennis Sculimbrene, told a Senate committee that White House officials asked him to get information about Travel Office employees before they were fired. The Journal says “That was no ‘innocent mistake’.” ‘Two years ago, the Journal reported that hundreds of White House employees had failed to get security checks, because they were still undergoing drug tests. Most of them, including those who had access to the one thousand Republican FBI files, still today have not been able to obtain security clearances, and are going in and out of the White House daily on temporary passes! The Journal concludes its revelations with the observation that “Craig Livingstone isn’t just some loopy guy who wandered out of a Georgetown saloon into the White House. Craig Livingstone was in that highly sensitive job because, on the evidence that has emerged in the past week, his work was well up to the standard expected.” CLINTON’S DEATH SONG The political implications of this week’s revelations are clear: Clinton has now smeared ashes on his face, and is preparing to sing his death song. Washington insiders know that he is already more politically dead that Jimmy Carter or Gerald Ford, zombies who have been"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"wandering around for years like escapees from the set of a substandard Hollywood horror movie. Soon Clinton will join the living dead, while Hillary will be condemned to wander the Earth with him, each of them convinced to the last that “they did nothing wrong”. This may be true, but the more damning evidence is that they did nothing right, and the American people now have to pay the piper for their nonsense. A five-trillion-dollar debt, created out of thin air by the wizards of the Federal Reserve System; a totally demoralized population; and the most encouraging economic prospects are that within a few months, we will join the ranks of the Third World nations, most likely with their typical military dictatorships. HILLARY’S FLIGHT While her protege, Craig Livingstone, writhes before an inquiring Congressional committee like a trapped rat, echoing Hillary’s favorite line, “I don’t recollect”, Hillary herself has fled the country. Responding to inaudible demands for her presence, she rushed off to Europe on a whirlwind tour, which was designed solely to allow her to escape the maelstrom in the United States. Inevitably, she must return, perhaps to join her husband in his death-song. We are reminded of the last days of Nixon’s Presidency, when suddenly everyone turned on him; there were no defenders left. There will be no Beau Geste to ease Clinton’s journey into oblivion. Indicative of the process is the emergence of a new star in Washington, a thirty-year FBI veteran, who for years, as resident FBI agent in the White House, has been aghast at the destruction wrought on the nation by the Clintonista hippies. Now he has gone public, with a bestselling book Unlimited Access -- An FBI Agent Inside The Clinton White House. The agent, Gary W. Aldrich, overnight became the hottest guest on the talk show circuit. So great were the demands for his appearance that he had to turn down 60 Minutes to meet his prior commitments. Aldrich reports that “There was a unisex quality in the Clinton staff that set it apart from the Bush Administration.” He reports that Clinton was wont to stray from the White House to meet a celebrity gal at the downtown Marriott, favorite scene of Washington’s political trysts. Howls of rage emanated from the White House. Claims were made that it would be impossible for Clinton to evade his ever vigilant Secret Service protectors. Unfortunately, Hillary has frequently boasted in her newspaper column that her favorite sport is to elude her Secret Service escorts and drive about the city without hindrance. In this predilection, she differs from most Washingtonians, who would prefer an armed escort if they venture onto the crime-ridden streets. Other spin efforts, which were counter-productive, included demands from the Imperial Presidency that Gary Aldrich be forbidden to appear on any talk show. The Clintons, still divorced from the real world, failed to understand that these talk show hosts are committed to finding the most controversial guests in Washington, hoping that they will say something outrageous, in order to boost the ever-sagging ratings in the hot summer months. Aldrich’s book is filled with inside stories about the Clintons and their beehive of frenetic, drug-ridden young things, Marxists to the core, who have one thing in common: their hatred of America. Clinton recently lost one hero of his battle against all American traditions, when a Ukrainian Jewish refugee, Jeremy Boorda, miraculously promoted from cabin boy to"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Admiral, supposedly took his own life at the height of his struggle to destroy the old Annapolis crew of loyal Naval officers, who were unanimous in their dedication to flag and country. Another \"Washington suicide”, Chief of Naval Operations Boorda supposedly shot himself in the chest moments before he was to face a Newsweek correspondent who had wished to ask him about his connection with America’s most famous spy, the Israeli espionage agent, Jonathan Pollard, supposedly doing life in prison for his crimes, but scheduled to be returned to Israel a national hero as soon as Clinton pardons him in return for Jewish support in the approaching Presidential elections. THE ZIONIST COMMITMENT To prove his zealous commitment to the State of Israel, Clinton had to fill his White House staff from hordes of young Zionist Kibbutzniks, ardent Israeli-Firsters who look upon the United States as a virgin territory to be conquered and enslaved forever in Israel’s grandiose scheme of Israel Uber Alles , Israel Over the World. The deus ex machina of Clinton’s otherwise incomprehensible rise to political power has been the unholy trio of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith; Mossad, the Israeli espionage agency and Jonathan Pollard’s boss; and the ominous Jewish Defense League, the only terrorist organization operating full-time throughout the United States. It is true that Clinton’s incredible rise from rube-on-the-make to President of the United States was facilitated by the accident that Winthrop Rockefeller, one of John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s “Fortunate Five”, the richest youths in the world, fell in love with his Black Army sergeant during the Second World War, and wished to bring him back to New York as his personal trophy. His relatives issued a stern rebuke, and Winthrop was told to hie to the hinterlands for his then- bizarre tastes. He bought most of the state of Arkansas as his personal fiefdom, and installed his lover as his farm manager. When eager young Bill came along, Winthrop realized that he would be a valuable asset to the Rockefeller political program. No less an organ than the New York Times hailed the “brilliant young Clinton” as a comer. Even then, I predicted that the Rockefellers (read: the House of Rothschild, the creator of the Standard Oil Octopus) would boost Clinton into the Presidency. His qualifications were ideal: totally amoral, willing to do anything to get on, and totally sincere in his confidence in his own degeneracy. Amoral people who begin to doubt themselves must quickly be jettisoned. Clinton has never had this problem, nor has he ever been the cause of any qualms by his manipulators. MONEY AND TERRORISM With the Rockefeller fortune behind him, and the terrorist arm of the world Jewish conspiracy, the Anti-Defamation League Jewish Masonic organization, to run interference against any detractors, Clinton indeed had a clear road to the White House. His campaign had all the money it needed, all the propaganda provided courtesy of the New World Order, and international terrorism to stifle any public criticisms of his misdeeds. What the manipulators must have known was that Clinton would be a one-shot President. He has no staying power. From adolescence, he has had only one goal, instant self-gratification. This is no small qualification for an instrument of the New World Order. However, there is nothing in Clinton on which to build a genuine persona, the essential ingredient of any"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"public career. But, you may well ask, has he not had a career, his rise to the Presidency? Indeed he has, but it is no more than that, a rise, not a means of building on his successes. In fact, Clinton became President because all of the doors were opened for him. Now all the doors are closing, never to be opened again. Clinton’s fall from grace reached the point of no return when he commandeered the FBI files of his political rivals. He failed to realize that the Anti-Defamation League considers the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and indeed, the entire Department of Justice, its personal fiefdom, to be used only to further the Zionist cause, and not to be encroached upon by anyone. THE NESHER CELL In 1936, Philip Klutznick, incorporator of the Anti-Defamation League, founded an Israeli espionage unit, the Nesher cell (nesher means eagle in Hebrew), in the Department of Justice. By 1940, the Nesher group was running the entire Department of Justice, as it has ever since. The FBI has always been the willing tool of the Nesher operatives at Justice. It was the Nesher terrorists who orchestrated the massacres of the Weaver family and the Waco Holocaust, as a dire lesson to any Americans to dared to oppose their satanic program. At no time did the Nesher group anticipate that a mere President would presume to use their private organization, the FBI, for his own partisan purposes. Thus Clinton made certain his permanent retirement from the political scene. The ADL and the World Jewish Congress allow their stooges only one mistake. They will never be around to make a second one. They will use whatever means necessary to get rid of him, but it is likely that they will permit him to join their other house zombies, Ford and Carter. These living dead, drained of all their blood and life by the Jewish parasite, continue to live among us as a dire prediction of the fate that awaits all of us at the hands of the parasite. On the other hand, the Life Force of the Universe also waits for us, waits for us to join it, as we were intended to do. Yes, we have a choice. We can go on, drained of life by the parasite, or we can recognize and join the Living Universe, to grow with it and contribute to it as we were meant to do, and in so doing, to taste all the joy of creating life, of participating in the universe, no longer Earthbound, but freed to soar to the limitless expanse of all Creation. Know that there is a choice, and that you can, not must, make that choice. In our sublime and generous universe, there are no musts; there are only cans. What can you do? ************************************************ 18.) Twilight Of The FBI? The Clinton Connection 08/0l/96 For more than forty years, I have been a lone voice calling for the abolition of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have never ceased to oppose the criminal activities of this"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Federal agency, which for almost ninety years has committed atrocities against the people of America. When the sinister Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith ordered the FBI to massacre the Weaver family in Idaho, as a crucial part of its plan to exterminate all American patriots, I believed that at last the FBI had gone too far. I was wrong. When the ADL then ordered the FBI to exterminate the congregation of a Christian church in Waco, Texas, the famed Waco Holocaust, again I was certain that they had gone too far. However, neither the Ruby Ridge Massacre nor the Waco Holocaust caused any reaction throughout the United States. Most Christian ministers cheered the burning alive of babies in the Waco church as a fitting end for anyone who had been designated a victim by the ADL. CLOSING THE DOOR ON THE FBI Certainly I could not have predicted that President Bill Clinton, with his gift for destruction, would prove to be the instrument of dismantling the FBI. Clinton’s reckless misuse of FBI files in the White House seems certain to ensure the end of the FBI, even if it does not bring down Clinton himself. Although Filegate is still the sword of Damocles hanging over Clinton’s head at the White House, it is even more certain that it is the weapon which will write the finish to the long and sordid history of the FBI, Why is this? For the first time, the American people realize that there is something wrong with a federal agency which diligently compiles dirt on millions of innocent, law-abiding citizens, and then uses that ill-gotten information as the ultimate weapon of government tyranny. J. Edgar Hoover’s masterful campaign of deceit successfully persuaded the American people that the FBI stood as their bastion against the forces of crime and Communism. That charade was interred with the corpse of J. Edgar Hoover. We now know that each year, J. Edgar Hoover, the fabled Director of the FBI, held an annual press conference at which he denied that there was a Mafia, a Cosa Nostra, or an organized crime problem in the United States. We also know that, despite his vaunted stand against Communism, he catered to the desires of a succession of pro-Communist, left-wing presidents who depended on Communist votes, from Roosevelt to Lyndon B. Johnson. THE LATEST REVELATION On July 14, 1996, the Washington Post , the organ of the Establishment, headlined: “Giving White House Counsel FBI Files Is Illegal, Expert Says”. Carrying the byline of George Lardner Jr., Lardner tells us that “The FBI has been violating the law, at least technically, for more that 20 years in providing the White House with sensitive background reports on the people who work there, according to an expert on the Privacy Act.” Lardner ignores the fact that the FBI files requisitioned by the White House were on Republicans who were ex-employees of the White House, not “people who worked there --” present tense. More than one thousand files of Republican opponents were illegally obtained by the White House, and illegally released by the FBI. Washington’s leading expert on privacy law, the prominent Washington lawyer Robert Gellman, told Lardner that “the FBI is entitled to share the information only with a bona fide federal ‘agency’.”"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"And under the law, the White House counsel’s office is not an ‘agency', as Gellman points out. In response to Gellman, FBI General Counsel Howard M. Shapiro, told the Post: “There is no question that Gellman is right in that the definition of ‘agency’ in the Privacy Act has been interpreted by the courts not to apply to units of the White House that are involved in just advising the President, and, specifically, the White House counsel’s office.” However, Shapiro claimed that the requisition of the FBI files by the While House is “routine use”, a response which Gellman said was ridiculous but not surprising. Lardner tells us that Gellman spent 17 years dealing with the Privacy Act as a lawyer and staff director for the House government information subcommittee. He is now Washington’s leading consultant on privacy issues. THE DAM IS ABOUT TO BREAK Gellman’s revelation means that the dam is about to break. Soon we will see indictments of White House officials and FBI officials for illegal use of FBI files. Remember, President Nixon’s staff advisor, Charles Colson, was indicted, convicted and sent to federal prison for illegal use of one FBI file. What will be the sentence for illegal use of one thousand FBI files? There will also be lawsuits alleging violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 by Republican officials whose files were illegally requisitioned by the White House for political purposes. When these lawsuits make national news, the role of the FBI will come under re-examination. The American people will realize that FBI files were not gathered on criminals and Communists, but on innocent, law-abiding American citizens for purposes of terrorism. I have never been arrested or indicted for any offense, yet the FBI gathered some eight hundred pages on my personal activities and writings over forty-three years. I was only one victim of Hoover’s vicious COINTELPRO program, which had been set up by the ADL to exterminate American individuals who professed a love for God and country. By repeatedly having me fired from well-paying jobs, the ADL/FBI conspiracy intended to drive me to suicide. It was nothing less than a murder campaign. Now my fellow Americans will understand that I was only one of millions of decent Americans victimized by this vicious terrorist campaign, and they will demand an end to it. Within the year, the FBI will cease to exist. Its collapse will pave the way to dismantle other illegal agencies which function only for the program of the State of Israel; the Internal Revenue Service, also known as the Israeli Revenue Service, which annually collects from American workers funds to pay 96% of the entire national budget of the State of Israel since 1948; the State Department, which is the Foreign Ministry of the State of Israel; the Central Intelligence Agency, which functions as a subsidiary of the world wide Israeli terrorists operating as Mossad, or Israeli Intelligence; and many, many others. The abolition of these terrorist networks robbing the American people will not come from the Israel Democrats or the Israel Republican parties, but from the American people as a mass uprising. We have the example of the Berlin Wall, blessed by President Kennedy and all succeeding American presidents as a proper tool of tyranny against the people of Germany, which was torn down, brick by brick, by the outraged German people themselves. Look not to Government; look to God for the will to free yourselves."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" CLINTON’S FOLLY How did President Bill Clinton get himself into such a mess? As an astute politician, he was merely following the road of former Democratic presidents: Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson and Carter. After decades in power in the Byzantine bureaucracy of Washington, J. Edgar Hoover found that not only was he hated and feared by everyone during the Franklin D. Roosevelt regime, but also that his post was a prime piece of patronage which a sitting president might well wish to award to his cronies. Hoover grimly determined to survive, by catering to the basest whims of the Democratic presidents. He fed them titillating items, complete with photos of the sexual peccadilloes of their friends as well as their enemies. He also furnished them with incriminating financial information about bribes, illegal deals and other crooked maneuvers of political rivals, which allowed these presidents to dispose of them by sending them to prison. The aging mulatto eunuch, J. Edgar Hoover, knew that he was merely buying time. He was now committed for the remainder of his career to be a fawning toady of the Democratic regimes. Denounced by former Public Enemy Number One, Alvin Karpis, in his autobiography, as “that nigger fairy”, Hoover’s predilections were now the gossip of everyone who frequented the National Press Club. The nation’s most prominent journalists could not mention Hoover’s name, often in my presence, without a snicker. Nevertheless, they still would not print one word exposing the “Nation’s Number One Policeman”, a term which he had invented for himself as part of his ongoing public relations campaign. The practice of furnishing the White House with FBI tidbits about our nation’s political leaders had become so well entrenched that by the time Clinton came to Washington, it was accepted by everyone. For Lyndon B. Johnson’s titillation, Hoover had begun a nightly routine of calling Johnson for “bedtime sex”, in which he recited explicit sexual descriptions of his closest Washington associates. LBJ loved it. He indignantly dismissed frequent suggestions that it was time for Hoover to go. FROM WATERGATE TO FILEGATE Clinton had been in the White House only a few days before he was informed that the FBI would continue that time-honored practice of furnishing their files to him for his political operations. Like a child in a candy store, Clinton went berserk, and ordered one thousand political files. His loyal toadies at the J. Edgar Hoover Building gulped, knowing that each of the one thousand requests was absolutely illegal. Someone at the Bureau, perhaps Director Freeh himself, suggested that the requests not be signed, but that they bear only a typewritten signature. This would provide cover for the White House end, but it left the FBI totally exposed, participating knowingly in a criminal operation. No one at the FBI sensed any danger in this, because they had been committing crimes against American citizens for many years, with impunity. FBI employees who could shoot a little boy in the back at Ruby Ridge and burn babies alive in the Waco Holocaust, would not see the slightest danger in forwarding their files to the White House. HISTORY OF THE FBI"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Americans may well wonder how the FBI has been allowed to commit crimes against Americans for almost ninety years. The fact is that they led a very circumspect existence until the 1950s, when Hoover’s mind began to go. By 1960, he was considered hopelessly insane by those in the know in Washington. His heir apparent, William Sullivan, believed that Hoover would retire, as he had promised, and that Sullivan would move into the coveted Director’s office. On June 22, 1870, Congress created the “Department of Justice”, providing for a national attorney general. In 1908, in answer to inaudible demands from the American people for a team of “national investigators”. The Sundry Appropriations Bill for 1909 provided funding for a “Bureau of Investigation”. The force behind this demand was a small group of Masonic Canaanites, who had become enormously wealthy through criminal combinations since the Civil War, and who now wished to protect their ill-gotten gains by government tyranny against all possible competitors to prevent future competition. It has worked admirably ever since. Potential competitors to the monopolists are arrested, fined and closed down. Attorney General Joseph Bonaparte himself had testified against this funding at hearings on April 2, 1908. He warned that there was a strong possibility that “agents provocateurs” would develop in the proposed Bureau of Investigation. This prediction required no great prescience on the part of Bonaparte. It was inevitable that any national police force, such as the French Surete, the Gestapo and the KGB, must degenerate into a choir of self-seeking paid provocateurs and informants. CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE PEOPLE Despite Attorney General Bonaparte’s warnings, congress approved the funding of a “Bureau of lnvestigation”. The conspirators ensured their plan by putting one of their own in charge. Wall Street lawyer George Wickersham, of the firm of Wickersham and Taft, became Attorney General, and supervised the expansion of the new bureau. Congressman Walter J. Smith of Iowa had strongly opposed this bureau. He declared, “No general system of spying upon and espionage of the people, such as has prevailed in Russia, in France under the Empire, and at one time in lreland, should be allowed to grow up”. President Theodore Roosevelt, always a fervent believer in “big government”, and a former police commissioner of New York, threw his support behind the Bureau of Investigation. He declared that detectives who had sworn to uphold the law would never violate it. Today’s collection of conspirators, child murderers, and paid provocateurs at the FBI gives the lie to Roosevelt’s confident prediction. Congressman Shirley had also expressed his fear of the new organization, declaring at the hearings, “In my reading of history I recall no instance where a government perished because of the absence of a secret service force, but many there are that perished as a result of the spy system. If Anglo-Saxon civilization stands for anything, it is for a government where the humblest citizen is safeguarded against the secret activities of the execution of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"government ... Not in vain did our forefathers read the history of the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights ... The Fourth Amendment declares: ‘The right of the people to be secure in their persons, homes, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.‘” Loyal Congressmen had sought to prevent the establishment of the Bureau of Investigation by passing a bill on May 30, 1908 forbidding the Department of Justice from borrowing detectives from the Secret Service or from any other government agencies. The Department of Justice then covertly set up the Bureau of Investigation to circumvent this law. Thus the FBI, from its very inception, was marked with deceit and treachery. As for the Fourth Amendment guaranteeing the people to be secure in their persons, papers, homes and effects, the Constitution further guaranteed against a secret police, feared by our Founding Fathers, by writing into the Constitution , Article One Section Eight, “Congress shall have Power ... to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.” This language is quite clear. It means that Congress can only provide for the entity United States. It has no power to enact laws controlling the individual citizens, who are citizens of the several states. This reveals the intent of the Founding Fathers, that a central or federal government should not tyrannize its citizens as the European tyrants had tyrannized the future colonists of America. Furthermore, no federal agent had or has any jurisdiction over a citizen, this jurisdiction being reserved to the states. Nor can any federal agent set foot in any state without the express invitation of the legislature, or in times of armed insurrection. Then how are the covens of the FBI agents fanning out over all of the states, shooting and burning children? Not by the Constitution , certainly, but by lex talionis , the ancient law of tooth and claw, by brute force and by brute force alone. Thus they can only be opposed by brute force, since there is not even any Constitutional issue to be argued. One legal pretext is by unstated claim of martial law; we have been under martial law since the declaration of war in the First World War. There has been no peace treaty signed after World War II, for the sole intent of continuing martial law’s brutal reign in the United States. A DEMURE YOUTH John Edgar Hoover, who built a small government agency into a national power, was himself a small student at his Washington, D.C. high school. He was the smallest boy in his class, weighing a mere 119 pounds. His classmates later described him with such adjectives as “demure” and “petite”, words not usually used to describe a boy. They also mentioned that he was never known to date a girl, but that he had formed a close friendship with the burly captain of the high school football team, who carried his books home for him each afternoon. None of his classmates ventured to comment on this relationship, either then or later. While working at the Library of Congress, young Hoover studied law at night, and continued to reside with his parents. He also developed an active social life, which remained secret from his parents. He had learned the secret of making powerful friends in Washington. This demure and petite youth had attracted the attention of several prominent politicians who later proved to be very useful in promoting his career. One of these strange"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"alliances was with the politician Harlan Fiske Stone. As soon as Hoover attained his law degree, Stone found a position for him at the Bureau of Investigation which at that time employed only eight investigators. One of young Hoover’s first important assignments was to attack the home of Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh. The team had been ordered to seize and destroy all the copies of Lindbergh’s book, Your Country at War , which exposed the bankers’ plot to involve us in the First World War. When young Charles Jr. rushed out to defend his father, Hoover kicked him in his stomach. It was the future aviator’s first experience with big government. Congressman Lindbergh had been marked for destruction because he had led the recent fight in Congress to stop the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which he correctly predicted would establish the greatest trust in history. THE MYTH OF HOOVER’S ANTI-COMMUNISM William J. Burns was Chief of the Bureau of Investigation. It was he who had averted a possible Communist coup in Washington. His reward was to be called in by his superior, Harlan Fiske Stone, who fired him and replaced him with someone whose views were closer to his own, his friend and protege J. Edgar Hoover. Burns immediately sought help from friends on Capitol Hill, complaining to them that young Hoover had gotten his job “by the back door”. Hoover was not averse to the liberal sympathies of Harlan Fiske Stone, and the Bureau’s anti-Communist operations came to a sudden halt. The American Civil Liberties Union would have no further cause to complain. The Bureau’s voluminous files on Communist subversion were packed away, never to be seen again. Priceless documentation on such Communist agitators as Felix Frankfurter, then at Harvard University, were quietly disposed of. To make certain that there would be no further “anti- Communist” campaigns, the Harding Administration was wiped out by a massive counterattack, the Teapot Dome operation, which is too lengthy a story to be detailed here. A FRIEND AT THE BUREAU During his first four years as head of the Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover had an inseparable companion, T. Frank Baughman, whom Hoover had placed in charge of the headquarters staff, and second highest paid man at the bureau. Baughman committed the unpardonable offense of getting married, and Hoover acquired a new companion, who would remain with him the rest of his life. Clyde Tolson, five years younger than Hoover, was also a single, handsome young man about Washington, who had no interest in the opposite sex, but who had never lacked for powerful friends. He had been the private secretary for the Secretary of War, Newton Baker, and often worked late at night for his demanding employer. Baker had retired from Washington, his political career ended and Tolson was available when Hoover had been disappointed by his second in command. Tolson came to the Bureau of Investigation as J. Edgar Hoover’s personal confidant, the same role he had filled with Baker. Soon he was the new Number Two Man at the Bureau, a position he held until Hoover’s death. Another Hoover protege at the Bureau was Louis Nichols, who not only got married, with"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Hoover’s blessing, but who produced a son whom he named after his boss. Nichols also set up the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation, whose financing and expenditures remain murky. He found a number of prominent Jewish millionaires who advanced millions of dollars for the foundation. One tycoon was Louis Marx, founder of the Marx Toy Co., whose son-in-law, Daniel Ellsberg, stole the Pentagon Papers and turned them over to the New York Times . Another benefactor was Lou Rosenstiel, head of Schenley Liquor Company. Nichols then left the FBI to become public relations director for the liquor tycoons. These were the heirs of the old Reinfeld Syndicate, described by Henry Messick, on p. 197, Secret File : “Reinfeld had headed the Reinfeld Syndicate in the great days of the Big Seven, in partnership with the Bronfman brothers in Canada and Longie Zwillman, ‘the Al Capone of New Jersey’. Much of the liquor brought to Rum Row off the East Coast was transported there by the Reinfeld Syndicate.\" On p. 277, Messick writes: “The Reinfeld Syndicate was divided into two parts; the Canadian end was headed by the four Bronfman brothers, Samuel, Abraham, Harry and Allen. They began as owners of a small hotel and ended as the richest men in Canada and head of Distillers-Seagram. It was the Bronfmans’ duty to buy Canadian booze and ship it around the East Coast to the Rum Rows of Boston and New York.” These gangsters also provided much of the financial support for the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith, which exerted pressure to keep journalists from commenting that the rum-runners operated as a Jewish syndicate. BREAD CAST UPON THE WATERS Rosenstiel and the Bronfmans were richly rewarded for their donations to the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation, when its director, Louis Nichols, as the now-powerful Washington lobbyist for their liquor interests, pushed through bills which saved them many millions of dollars. In 1958, Nichols lobbied an excise tax bill through Congress which saved Schenley $50 million in taxes. He sponsored the Forand Bill, which extended the storage period for whiskey from eight to twenty years. As soon as this bill was passed, Schenley’s stock increased 67% in value, giving Lou Rosenstiel a windfall of $30 million in a single day! Nichols was well paid for his efforts; he acquired large estates in Virginia and New Jersey. Lewis (Lou) Rosenstiel and J. Edgar Hoover became close friends. Schenley’s firm was believed to represent Mafia investments in liquor production, principally for his closest associate, Meyer Lansky, known as the banker for the mob. Rosenstiel gave $100 million to Brandeis University and other pet charities. He contributed millions to the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation and bought 25,000 copies of Hoover’s book, Masters Of Deceit , distributing them to schools throughout the country. At one social occasion Rosenstiel’s wife Susan described J. Edgar Hoover appearing at their Plaza suite in a fluffy black dress. He was introduced to her by Roy Cohn as “Mary”. A year later Susan Rosenstiel again encountered Hoover at their Plaza suite, wearing a red dress with a black feather boa around his neck. (Anthony Summers, The Secret Life Of J. Edgar Hoover .) As Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover developed close connections with the Mafia. At the famed Stork Club in Manhattan, a special table was reserved for him where he could sit"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"with Sherman Billingsley, the owner, Walter Winchell, and Frank Costello who was then the boss of the New York Syndicate. In Miami, J. Edgar Hoover and Tolson were special guests each winter season at the headquarters of the mob, the Roney Plaza Hotel. Here the Mafia dons could gather in absolute safety. The Roney Plaza was the showplace of the Schine Hotel chain. I met longtime residents of the Middletown New York area who remembered when J. Meyer Schine was an itinerant peddler, peddling household supplies to farmers wives from a pack which he carried on his back. When New York’s Murder Inc. needed a quiet place in the country to torture and kill their victims without interference, they bought a hotel and asked J. Meyer Schine to run it for them. Soon he became president of a nationwide chain of lavish hotels and theaters. When Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, it was in the Ambassador Hotel, a Schine hotel, which even Kennedy’s biographer, Arthur J. Schlesinger found somewhat curious. It was at the Roney Plaza Hotel that Meyer Lansky claimed he had had Hoover and Tolson photographed together with a hidden overhead camera. He boasted that he now owned Hoover. Soon afterwards, Hoover began his annual press conferences at which he denied that there was a Mafia, or a crime syndicate, operating in the United States. THE “HOMINTERN” After the Second World War, occasional charges were made in Washington that there was a “Homintern”: an international homosexual and pro-Communist network of officials in Washington and in other national capitals. After swimming nude each day with President Lyndon Johnson in the White House pool, his intimate assistant, Walter Jenkins, whom Johnson had brought with him from Texas, would wander off to the YMCA down the street while ribald White House guards made comments about his going to “have lunch at the Y.” He was arrested there in January 1959, but the officers had no idea who he was. A second arrest October 7, 1964 exposed his White House connection. He was rushed to a hospital, allegedly suffering from “fatigue”. J. Edgar Hoover sent him flowers, and dispatched a horde of FBI agents into the Washington streets to counteract the ensuing publicity. ALL BASES ARE COVERED From the onset of his Washington career, J. Edgar Hoover seemed to know instinctively how to get ahead. After obtaining his office though the patronage of men like Harlan Fiske Stone, Hoover cemented his position with diplomatic alliances with the Mafia, New York’s wealthiest Jews, and the Masons. On November 9, 1920, Hoover was raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason in Federal Lodge Number 1. In April, 1921, he obtained the various degrees of Royal Arch Mason. When Clyde Tolson became his consort in 1928, his first requirement was that Tolson join the Masons. Hoover’s only business connection in his career was that for many years he served as a director of the official Masonic insurance company, Acacia Mutual Life Insurance. Hoover also joined the University Club, the National Geographic Society, and became a reserve officer of the Army’s Military Intelligence Division. THE RAVAGES OF AGE"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Although J. Edgar Hoover lived out his remaining years as the most powerful individual in Washington, the only American who had his own private army, subject only to his whims, the strain of living his double life, the least kept secret in Washington, and the knowledge that each day the number of his enemies increased, now took his toll. His heir apparent at the Bureau, William Sullivan, had been promised for eight consecutive years that Hoover would retire, relinquishing the Bureau to his successor. Sullivan finally asked him to announce a date for retirement. The next morning, Sullivan arrived at FBI headquarters to find that the locks had been changed on his door, his parking place and secretary were gone. He was never allowed to enter the FBI building again. In a revealing book, The Bureau , which had a very brief sale, Sullivan records on p. 248 a conversation with then Attorney General William Kleindienst. While Sullivan was in his office, Kleindienst received a call from Hoover. “Kleindienst held the receiver away from his ear, looked at me and pointed to his head with his finger.” Kleindienst told Sullivan that Hoover had been out of his mind for at least three years. Sullivan agreed that he was out of touch with reality. Kleindienst responded, “That’s the legal definition of insanity.” Another prominent FBI agent, Arthur Murtagh, stated in an interview on national television, “Those of us who were in touch with J. Edgar Hoover concluded that during the last three years of his life he was insane.” Insanity, like degeneracy, is an accepted fact of life in Washington. No politician dared complain that the nation’s security was in the hands of a madman. Sullivan himself, forcibly retired, was shot and killed in a mysterious hunting accident, silencing him forever. THE LAST BLACKMAIL J. Edgar Hoover, at the height of the Watergate imbroglio, learned that the money for the historic break-in at Democratic National Headquarters had come from Dwayne Andreas and was laundered through Mexico. Andreas had been the principal financial backer of Nixon’s rival, Humphrey. It was interesting that he provided the funds which led to Nixon’s downfall, and the repudiation of Nixon’s re-election. Hoover’s findings were promptly relayed to the conspirators. That evening as he entered his bulletproof limousine, he was quickly strangled. The body was taken to his home where he was dumped in his bedroom. It was discovered at 8:30 a.m. on May 2, 1972, by his longtime maid Annie Fields. An era had ended. HOOVER’S LEGACY Despite his untimely removal, Hoover left intact that vast espionage and terror network of the ADL-Mafia. It continued to be used. Faithful to his consort to the last, Hoover cut all of his relatives out of his will leaving everything to Clyde Tolson, with bequests to a few of his flunkies at the FBI. He was succeeded by a covey of clowns, the latest being Clinton appointee Louis Freeh. The FBI staggered from one outrage to another, insisting upon carrying out the requirement of the ancient Cult of Baal, that small children should be"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ritually sacrificed to appease their demonic gods. This is the real story behind the atrocities at Ruby Ridge and the Waco Holocaust. Of course none of the well paid Washington journalists have ever explained it to the public. Although Clinton and his protege Freeh, inherited the best of the FBI, its enormous political power, they also inherited the worst, Hoover’s well known insanity. Today, as in Hoover’s heyday, the FBI is an agency gone berserk, run by madmen to promote the diabolic program of other madmen. LEGAL SUMMATION We have presented this evidence about the criminal acts committed by the President of the United States and his loyal henchmen at the FBI. These documented details of crime and misrule do not mean that these events are in themselves earthshaking or of permanent importance, but that this is a time of judgment. You are placed on notice that you are to judge. From what I have presented to you, you must judge. What is your role as an American? These events require that you make a statement, that you tell us who you are and what you believe in. Are you an American whose passion is for justice, whose only love is for liberty and whose dedication is to life? Or, are you one of those others? One of the Unbidden Ones, who have come upon us with their vileness to poison and destroy us? It is no longer possible to go both ways, to be of more than one kind or to evade our loyalty to our land. Think on these things and render your answer, not to us but to yourself. ************************************************  19.) Eustace Mullins' Latest Harassment 09/07/96 Letter From Eustace Mullins To: Gordon Bethune Chairman, Ceo Continental Air Lines 2929 Allen Parkway Houston, Tx 77019 Dear Chairman Bethune, I wish to inform you that I am preparing a civil lawsuit against Continental Air Lines to be filed in federal court in the amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) damages and five million dollars punitive damages as the result of an assault on my person by a Continental Air Lines employee at National Airport, 22 Aug. 1996. These are the circumstances: I was standing in line at the ticket counter with my briefcase on the floor beside me. After a considerable period of time, I obtained my ticket. Someone then called out, “Is this your"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"briefcase?” I turned to see a Continental Air Lines employee brandishing my briefcase. “Yes, it is,” I replied. “It’s been here for a very long time,” she said. “I’ve been standing here in line for a very long time,” I responded. “Someone may have put something in it,” she said. “It has been with me the entire time,” I said. “No one could have put anything in it. If we hadn’t become so involved with the State of Israel, we wouldn’t have to go through all these complications.” The CAL employee gave me a stern look, and beckoned me over to a vacant area of the ticket counter. She then said, “I’m Jewish myself, and I don’t like what you said.” “But, it’s true,” I replied. She then said in a threatening manner, “Now this briefcase will have to undergo a complete inspection.” “I am going to the inspection area now,” I said, “in order to get to the gate.” “No, I will take care of this,” she said. She then tried to get several people on the phone for about ten minutes, while I protested I might miss my plane. She then made entries on a computer. Finally, she marched me to the inspection area, where three Black inspectors went through my briefcase, staring at me all the while as though I must be a very dangerous terrorist. I had a very valuable antique plate in my briefcase, and I was terrified that these inspectors, who were very clumsy, might break it. After the inspection your CAL employee accompanied me all the way to the gate, repeatedly making threatening comments that “I am supposed to turn you over to the police for making inflammatory remarks.” I replied that I had made no inflammatory remarks. She was obviously trying to goad me into making other statements, which I wisely refused to do. Although I finally made my plane, I missed my Cleveland connection, which should have put me in Chicago at 12:02. Instead, I missed my pickup, and had to hire a taxi, which cost almost fifty dollars. My lawsuit is for personal damages, but it will also bring into focus the incredible inconveniences inflicted on airline passengers by Continental Air Lines, a willing co- conspirator in the propaganda hoax called “the War Against Terrorism”. The fact is that despite the expenditure of many billions of dollars and awesome loss of time by your passengers, the campaign against terrorism has never apprehended a single terrorist or prevented the loss of a single airplane. It does achieve its goal, which is to psychologically condition Americans that no personal sacrifice is too great to continue American military support of the State of Israel in its war against its Arab neighbors, which is another propaganda hoax designed to aid the “Seven Sisters” to maintain the high price of oil. Although Congress is the principal villain in American military support for Israel, in exchange for Zionist political contributions and media support, Continental Air Lines is shown to be a more than willing conspirator in this propaganda hoax and outrage against the American public, as demonstrated by your CAL employee’s personal assault against me, acting solely in support of the State of Israel, and not for the supposed campaign of “protecting” us against terrorism. CAL has proven that it is more than willing to assault its paying customers in order to support the State of Israel, and this stance is actionable in our courts. After this assault, I refused to fly on Continental on my return trip, travelling by other transportation.

Why Dole Threw The Election The Inside Story Of The 1996 Elections Dear Readers: I enclose one of my most important articles, exposing how the American people were betrayed by Dole and his fellow conspirators in the recent election. I only did the research after the election or I would have exposed him earlier. This is all new research and documented. It may help warn the people what to expect from the criminals and their fetid conspiracies. With best regards, Eustace Mullins. 11/22/96 An analysis of the 1996 Presidential election reveals that Robert J. Dole, the Republican nominee, deliberately threw the election to his Democratic opponent, William Clinton. Why did Dole sell out his own party’? There are two reasons. First, his personal health. He was told that he probably would not survive a four-year stint in the White House. The glowing reports about Dole’s health which were issued during the campaign sounded strangely like the reports which were issued during Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1944 campaign, in which a propped-up, dying cripple was advertised to the American people as a vigorous, healthy candidate. I remember those reports, and I also remember that Roosevelt died a few weeks after his inauguration. The second reason is that Dole had to lose in order to preserve the two party political system in the United States. The Democratic Party has not been able to win a national election since 1968. Analysts point out that its core strength was its White conservative Southern bloc of voters. This support was cast aside when the Democrats became the party of the minorities, the party of Blacks, Zionists, Communists, and homosexuals. An immediate objection can be raised that the Democrats won in 1976 with Jimmy Carter, in 1992 with Bill Clinton, and in 1996 with Bill Clinton. However, they won only because in each of those elections the Republican Party ran its weakest candidate, in a deliberate conspiracy to give the election to the Democratic candidate. I pointed out in 1976 that Gerald Ford was the only Republican whom Carter could beat; therefore, Ford became the Republican candidate. In 1992, Bush was the only candidate whom Clinton could beat; in 1996, Robert J. Dole was selected as the only Republican candidate whom Clinton could defeat in his bid for re-election. A TALENT FOR CONSPIRACY"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"In becoming the Republican nominee for the 1996 campaign, Dole revealed a hitherto unsuspected talent for conspiracy. He accepted the nomination, knowing that he was intended to lose, and that he would conduct a campaign which would guarantee that he would lose. This was a difficult assignment, because Clinton presented such a vulnerable target. He had more evidence of financial and sexual offenses compiled against him than all other previous Presidents combined! However, Dole resolutely refused to use this evidence, substituting vague references to “character” instead of demolishing Clinton’s personal reputation. Ross Perot presented a thirty-minute television summation of Clinton’s background the night before the election; the result was that he increased his share of the votes from three to eight per cent! With a single speech summing up Clinton’s reputation, Dole would have won an overwhelming victory. However, Dole chose not to do this. Why? THE ULTIMATE BELTWAY INSIDER In his years in Washington, Robert J. Dole, the man from Russell, Kansas, a bucolic American small town, had become the ultimate Beltway insider. His closest friends were lobbyists and billionaires such as Dwayne Andreas of the notorious Archer Daniels Midland Corporation, grain purveyors to the world. These lobbyists depended upon Dole to ram through Congress such devastating bills as TEFRA, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act in 1982, which became the biggest tax increase in American history, raking in more than $320 billion dollars in new revenue for the big spenders in Washington. He also conspired with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In 1981, President Reagan picked Greenspan to head the National Commission on Social Security Reform. By ignoring the statistics, Greenspan came up with an increase in FICA collections which resulted in a $200 billion tax increase for America’s workers, one of the largest tax increases in American history. And who shepherded the Greenspan tax increase through Congress? Robert J. Dole managed the Congressional approval of the sellout of the American people. By entering into the conspiracy to throw the election in 1996, Dole proved that he had risen above the title of Republican; he was now a member of the Super Party, also known as the Federal Reserve Party, or the Central Bank Party. He chose as his running mate Jack Kemp, a person for whom he had the greatest dislike. The National Review complained in its issue of November 28, 1996, days before the election, that “Neither Kemp nor Dole has ever won a campaign involving a large competitive electorate.” That is why they were chosen. They were a pair of born losers in a national campaign. THE SAD CAMPAIGN Dole’s Presidential campaign was everything that the World Order wanted. The sad spectacle of the aging candidate shuffling sideways, his useless arm dangling beside him, was one of the most depressing sights in American political history. One Washington correspondent quipped that Dole was conducting a “3-D campaign”, progressing from “dour to despondent to depressing.” The editorial page of the Washington Post described him as “the world’s oldest living mummy”. However, the physical spectacle was overshadowed by Dole’s deliberate practice, throughout his campaign, to avoid not only any mention of Clinton’s scandalous personal history, but also to refuse to discuss any"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"serious issue whatever. He had been told that the three issues on which he could win were insistence on a realistic welfare reform, abolition of affirmative action, and Clinton’s insane foreign policy of dispatching American troops to such non-essential areas as Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia. He refused to mention any of them throughout the campaign. His liberal chief of staff, Sheila Burke, told him that if he criticized affirmative action, he would lose the female vote. Criticism of welfare would cost him the Black vote, which was already 96% for Clinton. And criticism of Clinton’s foreign operations, which were designed solely to bolster the dwindling military-industrial complex, would be “un- American”. As an old soldier, Dole would not criticize his draft-dodging commander in chief. DOLE’S SEARCH FOR A RUNNING MATE When Robert Dole announced that he was looking for a suitable running mate, political analysts supposed that he would choose some well-known and reputable Republican conservative such as the Republican governor of Wisconsin and other states. Instead, he spent weeks pleading with Colin Powell to be his companion on the ticket, although Powell, for reasons of his own, had already announced in November 1995, that under no circumstances would he be a political candidate. One Washington reporter wrote that for eighteen consecutive days, Dole was on the phone, begging Powell to accept. Not only did Dole lower himself in the eyes of many Americans by grovelling before Powell, but he also caused widespread doubts about himself as a viable candidate. Powell, who avoided a political race for a number of personal reasons, including his role in the My Lai massacre coverup, had frequently claimed to be Jewish. Powell also was the personal protege of Caspar Weinberger when Weinberger was Secretary of Defense. He made Powell his chief aide, and sponsored his career. Weinberger was part of the notorious team from Bechtel Corp. which ran the Reagan Administration, with Weinberger at Defense, and George Shultz as Secretary of State. Powell’s adoption by Weinberger showed that he had been chosen for an important position in the World Order. KEMP, THE GREAT LIBERAL Dole shocked his core supporters by choosing the most liberal Republican in the party, Jack Kemp, as his running mate. Kemp was the darling of the New York neoconservatives, former Trotskyite Communists who now claimed to be “anti-Communist”. The billionaire, Lewis Lehrman, owner of the Rite-Aid Drug chain and other retail operations, had set up the Lehrman Institute to promote political candidates. Kemp was the chief beneficiary. The New York Times wrote a gushing approval the day Kemp joined the ticket. The article was labelled, “A Passion for Ideas”, and commented on Kemp’s great contributions to public debate, notably his espousal of “free enterprise zones” and \"empowerment” in the Black ghettoes. Although Kemp promoted these fantasies for years, nothing ever came of them. Newsweek marvelled at Kemp’s command of “the theories of supply side economics, policy innovations like urban enterprise zones. Newsweek quoted Kemp’s mentor, Jude Wanniski, as revealing that Kemp “was ripe for conversion when I met him in 1976,” referring to Wanniski’s “supply side theories” of economics. Wanniski said that Kemp had conferred with him every day for twenty years. Kemp had then endorsed Steve Forbes for"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"president before ending up as Dole’s choice. The New Republic on Nov. 4, 1996 noted that “Jack Kemp routinely sends lefty types into paroxysms of cooing approval.” They described him as “every liberal’s favorite Republican, including Harlem Democrat Charles Rangel, the most leftwing member of the Black Caucus.” THE BIG SELLOUT Although Dole delivered a good speech at the Republican nominating convention, the Republican Party censored any mention of affirmative action as “too divisive”. During the ensuing campaign, Clinton sailed by Dole and Kemp in his steady move to the right, adopting most of the Republican Party’s basic program, while Dole and Kemp moved steadily left, amazing everyone who had planned to vote for them. By spending four- hundred-billion dollars, much of it in public funds, on their deceptive campaign, Dole and Kemp committed fraud on a grand scale. Statistics showed that seventy-five per cent of Americans now lived in states which had Republican governors. This proved the steady shift to conservatism which had been going on in America for more than thirty years. Stephen Moore wrote in the National Review, Oct. 28, 1996, “Democrats are almost certainly more in danger of a permanent minority status.” Then how did Dole and Kemp lose? Because they tried harder to lose while Clinton was trying to win. Kemp had publicly opposed both Proposition 187 and Proposition 209 in California, which tried to remedy the abuses of affirmative action. As the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, he headed the largest leftwing government boondoggle in history. THE DIVIDED DEMOCRATS During the 1996 campaign, the Democrats had been weakened by dividing into two opposing camps; John B. Judis writing in the New Republic , Sept. 16, 1996, headlined, “Do the Democrats Have a Future? Do They Deserve One?” He pointed out that the Democratic Party was split into two groups which bitterly opposed each other: the New Democrats, led by the Democratic Leadership Council under the leadership of Albert Gore; and the “economic populists” led by Gephardt. The Democratic Leadership Council had been founded in 1985 by Al From and Will Marshall, two Democratic staffers who wanted to replace the Democratic National Committee. They wanted to supplant the control of the National Committee by extreme leftwing types from the AFL-CIO and Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition, which had doomed the Mondale campaign in 1984, and which threatened to end any future victories by the Democrats. This was the remnant of the Democratic Party coalition formed by Bella Moskowitz in New York in 1928, which elected Franklin D. Roosevelt Governor of New York and later president for four terms. A Jewish Communist labor leader, Bella Moskowitz was a hard-line Stalinist devotee. She welded an unbeatable front of Jews, Blacks, Communists, and labor leaders, and brought the Communist-dominated New York teachers union into her fold. In the ensuing forty years, this coalition had never deviated from its hard-line Communist program; by 1968 it was history. Clinton ran screaming from its survivors to win the 1996 election. THE TWILIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATS"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Even the Blacks had begun to threaten to desert the old Moskowitz coalition, which had long taken their support for granted. Tom Wicker in the Nation , June 17,1996, wrote “Deserting the Democrats”, urging that Afro-Americans and the poor should leave the Democratic Party. He wrote, “an early repudiation of the Democrats by Afro-Americans would be in their own and the nation’s best interest.” It seemed that Dole and Kemp would have an easy campaign against the bitterly divided Democratic Party. However, no one yet suspected both Dole and Kemp’s iron determination to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. This goal was ensured by Dole’s secret Brain Trust, which I researched only after the disastrous election. At no time during his campaign did Dole reveal that his brain trust was composed of advisers who had a long history of ruinous advice for Republican candidates. Matthew Miller revealed their names in the June 3, 1996 issue of the New Republic , itself one of the most volatile propagandists for the State of Israel. Miller stated that Dole’s brain trust consisted of Senator Spencer Abraham; Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, who was forced out as president Reagan’s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers after he publicly demanded huge tax increases and cuts in Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Also on Dole’s brain trust was Gary Becker of the University of Chicago and the notorious Hoover Institute which had doomed Reagan’s presidential program. Becker recently succeeded Milton Friedman as head of the “Chicago School” of economics, which was merely the American version of the Rothschild “Vienna School” which functioned as the creature of the central banks and which promoted world wars. Miller quoted “Top Dole aide Sheila Burke” as saying the brain trust would widen to include Dale Jorgenson, chairman of Harvard’s Department of Economics; Michael Boskin, head of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, whose advice sent Bush down in defeat, and John Lipsky, the chief economist of investment bankers Salomon Brothers. We should note that Robert Dole, who billed himself as “The Man from Kansas” did not have anyone from Kansas on his brain trust. This Elite group of Wall Street bankers and Harvard economists stood for big government, increased taxes, and the slow stagnation of the American economy as American jobs headed south of the border and to the Pacific Rim. DOLE’S LIBERAL ASSOCIATES During Dole’s Campaign for the Presidency as a Republican, he prudently kept his chief assistant, Sheila Burke, out of sight. The Wall Street Journal had repeatedly exposed Burke as one of the most liberal officials on Capitol Hill, more suited for Teddy Kennedy’s staff than a “rock-ribbed Republican”, as Dole claimed to be. The Journal’s exposé of Burke caused the New York Times to leap to her defense in a lengthy article in the prestigious Sunday Times Magazine . Time magazine also deplored the attacks on Sheila Burke. Nevertheless, her liberal sympathies were legendary on Capitol Hill. She controlled all access to Senator Dole; once he became majority leader, she was the most powerful Senatorial assistant in Washington. However, the most revealing aspect of Dole’s secret alliances was revealed in his Who‘s Who biography, which listed him as being on the board of the Center for Strategic and"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"International Studies. This top secret think tank has long been the chief agent of the World Order in Washington. Its principal policy makers are Henry Kissinger and Jeane Kirkpatrick, the leading “neoconservatives”. It serves as the political centre for a host of satellite groups, including the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, and the World Jewish Congress. In order to serve on the board of this prestigious think tank, Dole would have had to be included in the most secret conferences of the World Order. Dole has loyally served the Kissinger-Kirkpatrick-Greenspan neoconservative conspiracy as their pointman on Capitol Hill, ensuring that their most diabolical tax policies could be inflicted upon the American people, always with Dole as the crucial pivot in enacting this legislation. Peter Steinfels explains the scam in his definitive work, The Neoconservatives , which is quoted in my work, The World Order : “The leading neoconservatives who were Socialists in those years (the 1930s) were virtually all anti-Stalinists (Trotskyites). Well-drilled in Marxist texts and socialist history, bloodied in the tribal wars between Communists, democratic socialists, and fifty-seven varieties of Trotskyists, they were already trained and in motion when the Cold War put their skills at a premium.” Steinfels notes that the “Neoconservatives have been strong supporters of Israel.” Irving Kristol, the ideological leader of the neoconservatives, says, “Neoconservatism is not at all hostile to the idea of the welfare state.” This may explain Dole’s refusal to criticize affirmative action. Kristol’s son, Bill, is famed as the principal policy-maker for the Republican Party. Norman Podhoretz, longtime editor of Commentary for the American Jewish Congress, recently published the last word on the neoconservative conspiracy, Neoconservativism: A Eulogy , in which he boasts, “Neoconservatism was created to help Israel take advantage of the Cold War. Our work is now done.” .This boast reveals the sordid strategy behind the Dole-Kemp “neoconservative” bid for the White House. They were expendable and they are no longer needed. Lehrman and other Zionist millionaires poured out many millions of dollars for Dole and Kemp’s abortive runs for the presidency. It is doubtful that they will be exhumed for further bids. DOLE’S NEOCONSERVATIVE ALLIES Peter Beinart, in the New Republic , June 3, 1996 comments that Dole refused to attack Clinton’s interventionist foreign policy, which was essential to the neoconservative program. Beinart writes “those who try to influence this world, this school, which includes Dole confidantes like Jeane Kirkpatrick and former Reagan Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle, might be called neoconservative moralist.” Dole’s “conservative\" reputation began when he became a Nixon loyalist as Nixon’s pointman on Capitol Hill. When Dole became chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Alan Greenspan, a partner of J.P. Morgan Co., sought him out and converted him into his most loyal ally. Under Greenspan’s direction, Dole engineered the vicious Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, costing the American people $320 billion dollars, and the tremendous increase in Social Security taxes under FICA. Yet Greenspan ensured Dole’s defeat for the presidency when he announced in September 1996 that the Federal"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Reserve Board would not increase the interest rate. Historically, when the World Order wants to defeat an incumbent president, they announce an interest rate hike before the election. I pointed out at that time that Greenspan had now guaranteed Clinton’s re- election, and that Dole could not win. THE INFLATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN In Nation magazine, March 11, 1996, one of its most senior writers, Robert Sherrill, published an important article, “The Inflation of Alan Greenspan”, which documented some of the most notorious episodes in Greenspan’s career. It is well worth reading in its entirety. I quote: “It was Greenspan, according to Bob Woodward’s The Agenda , who, working secretly with Bentsen, shaped the economic plan which President Clinton still follows. The Fed’s legislative charter mandates that it pursue maximum employment as well as stable prices and interest rates. But Greenspan has no intention of using the Fed to expand employment, and he isn’t shy about saying so. In fact, he has asked Congress to formally amend the charter to kill the first part of that mandate. Nor does Clinton seem to be bothered by the fact that Greenspan’s career -- as economic adviser to four Presidents, (three of them Republican) -- has included an impressive string of faulty predictions, obvious deceptions and pandering to the sleaziest side of Wall Street and the banking world. For more than two decades, Alan Greenspan has, one way or another, been picking your pocket in a big way .. As a disciple of Ayn Rand, Greenspan genuinely believes the practice of unrestricted capitalism is the highest morality.” Sherrill lays much of Gerald Ford’s defeat for election on Greenspan. Journalist Hobart Rowen recalls that Greenspan and Ford were willing to drag the nation through a long period of recession and stagnation .. to cure the inflationary menace. “Ford was dumped by the voters in 1976,” says Sherrill, “while Greenspan charged Charles Keating, who is now in prison; $40,000 for letters to government regulators in 1985, that Keating and his crooked peers were solid as Gilbraltar. Greenspan called Lincoln Savings and Loan, under Keating’s bank management, ‘seasoned and expert’. Of seventeen Savings and Loans Greenspan had cited in another letter to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as superbly run businesses, fifteen were insolvent within four years after he had spoken up for them. In 1981, President Reagan picked Greenspan to head the National Commission on Social Security Reform. The solution Greenspan’s gang recommended -- and Congress accepted -- resulted in a $200 billion tax increase, one of the largest tax increases in history. Greenspan raised interest rates in 1988, causing recession by 1990. Evans and Novak call him Doctor Pain. Greenspan is a kind of Typhoid Mary to Presidents. His advice sank Ford in 1976. A Greenspan-created recession resulted in Bush’s defeat.” We might suppose that Greenspan could have exerted his great power to raise the interest rate in September 1996, and ensure his collaborator Dole’s election to the White House. However, both Dole and Greenspan follow a scenario written by the World Order. For whatever reason, the Elitists had decided to return Clinton to the White House. The tremendous pressure against him from financial and sexual scandals ensure that he will be a docile president, amenable to whatever the World Order commands. Meanwhile, Dole retires to a well paid old age."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"************************************************ 22.) Latest Filings In The Berkshires Mass. Lawsuit 0l/10/97 Dear Brett, Enclosed is my latest filing in the Berkshires (Mass.) lawsuit. It is one of the most important legal documents I have ever filed, as I have never before formally charged the FBI in court with murdering my family as I had not brought this in as a legal issue in prior lawsuits. Also, I have never before complained about having each of my civil rights lawsuits over a period of fifty years dismissed without a hearing, a trial, or a jury decision. It is very important to do this now because not only is the FBI agent being charged with espionage, but also Congressman Henry Hyde is opening hearings on the FBI Filegate and other offenses. Hyde is actually Congressman Jekyl, a demon who intends to whitewash the FBI as Bill McCollum and Hyde did during the Ruby Ridge Massacre and the Waco Holocaust Congressional Hearings. In order to deal summarily with me as in all previous lawsuits, they have assigned Judge Freedman, a kinsman of Judge Grunhaus, Silberman and all the other Zionist judges who have denied me justice. 1997 is the year of the final breakthrough on all fronts. There is no doubt that Contact will be the instrument of the final breaking of the dam ushering in the real America for which we have strived so long. Congratulations!!! I get letters and calls every day from people who have seen my work in CONTACT. They are unanimous in agreeing in the important nature of this work. You will have a great 1997! All the best from, /s/ Eustace Mullins UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS, WESTERN SECTION CIVIL ACTION NO. 96CO3022I-FHF EUSTACE C. MULLINS, Plaintiff v. THE BERKSHIRE EAGLE Defendant"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT Now comes the Plaintiff, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as Pro Propria Personae, and respectfully moves that this action be removed to State Court where it originated, for the following reasons: 1. Plaintiff brought this action under Article XI, Constitution of Massachusetts and continuously cited other sections of the Constitution of Massachusetts in his Complaint. 2. Plaintiff determined that federal court would not be the proper vehicle for this action because, during the past fifty years, Plaintiff has brought many civil rights actions in federal court, documenting horrendous violations of his civil rights, and in every instance these civil rights actions were dismissed without a court hearing. When Plaintiff refiled these actions, they were dismissed with Prejudice, precluding further hearing. 3. In each action, Plaintiff has demanded jury trial, but has never received a jury trial. 4. Plaintiff found an explanation for these federal court refusals to hear his civil rights complaints in the famous Massachusetts case of Wayfield v. Tisbury, which has been in litigation for many years. The court ruled against Wayfield in this civil rights compliant with the opinion that: “Wayfield identifies himself merely as a Christian European- American, which is not a constitutionally protected class.” 5. In Plaintiff’s many preceding civil rights actions, the federal courts apparently dismissed these actions on the presumption that Plaintiff is not a member of a constitutionally protected class, consisting of women, Blacks, Jews, Hispanics and homosexuals, and therefore cannot bring a civil rights action in any federal court. However, in a careful reading of the Constitution of the United States of America , Plaintiff is unable to find any passage which reserves justice to women, Blacks, Jews, Hispanics and homosexuals, and therefore affirms that the federal courts have been in error in his preceding civil rights actions. 6. Further light is shed on this predilection of our federal courts in a confidential memo from the Office of Policy Development dated 10-5-89 (obtained by Citizens for God and Country), titled “Soviet Legal Reform To Date”, as follows: “Socialist Legal State” “Transformation of the USSR into a ‘socialist legal state’ was a prominent element of Gorbachev’s reform program as it was formulated prior to the June 1988 party conference.” Plaintiff finds a remarkable correlation between Gorbachev’s “socialist legal state” and the summary disposal of Plaintiff’s civil rights actions in our federal courts, in which a quasi- theocratic commitment to “diversity” has replaced constitutional law. 7. A further explanation of the summary dismissal of Plaintiff’s preceding civil rights"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"actions in our federal courts may be seen in the attitude of the federal courts towards American citizens who exercise their constitutional right to represent themselves in federal court. Plaintiff, appearing for himself, was never allowed to appear in federal court in these documented civil rights violations. 8. Plaintiff was a valued employee of the Library of Congress in 1952, when he was discharged at the request of Senator Herbert Lehman, D.N.Y., partner of the billionaire banking house of Lehman brothers. Lehman was also National Chairman of the Anti- Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, a censorship group which wished to halt Plaintiff’s expose of the Federal Reserve System which had been commissioned by the poet Ezra Pound, who was held as a political prisoner without trial in Washington, D.C. Plaintiff contacted two Congressmen and had a Librarian of Congress removed. The Librarian was then given a sinecure with UNICEF in Paris, where he enjoyed a sodden old age. Plaintiff sued his successor at the Library of Congress for reinstatement, but the civil rights suit was dismissed without a hearing. Plaintiff is still the only person ever discharged from the Library of Congress for political reasons. 9. Plaintiff’s history of the Federal Reserve System was published in 1953. In 1955, a German edition was published in Oberammergau, Germany, site of the Passion Play. The edition of 10,000 copies was ordered burned by U.S. High Commissioner of Germany, James Conant, and his Assistant High Commissioner, Benjamin Buttenweiser, partner of the Rothschild representative in New York, Kuhn, Loeb Co. Another partner of Kuhn, Loeb Co., Paul Warburg, is generally credited as the secret author of the Federal Reserve Act. Kuhn, Loeb Co. partner Jacob Schiff, honored as a prince in Israel, financed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia with his own funds. Buttenweiser’s wife, Helen Lehmen, was Alger Hiss’s lawyer during his perjury trials. Plaintiff sued in U.S. Court of Claims for damages for the burned book. The case was dismissed without a hearing. Plaintiff remains the only writer who has had a book burned in Europe since the Second World War. 10. In 1958, poet Ezra Pound had been held without trial by the federal government for thirteen and a half years, on an indictment initiated by Alger Hiss. Plaintiff contacted a congressman, who demanded an inquiry. The government dropped all charges and Pound was released. Federal agencies, infuriated by Plaintiff’s role in freeing their victim, Ezra Pound, launched a serious vendetta against Plaintiff which has continued to the Present day. “A Writ for Martyrs” by Eustace Mullins, published by the O.T.U. Christ Church, 1985, reproduces on page 63 (page G-37 from Plaintiff’s official FBI file) an order from J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, ordering Plaintiff committed to a mental institution for life, as Top Priority. The command had been initiated by A. Rosen, Assistant Director of the FBI for Jewish Affairs. “A Writ for Martyrs” contains thirty pages of official FBI files relating to the commitment of Plaintiff to a mental institution. Most of Plaintiff’s FBI file is still held by the FBI, which refuses to release it on grounds that it would “endanger national security”. Plaintiff recently renewed demand for this file, but was informed the FBI would not be able to respond for four years. Hoover’s order to commit Plaintiff to a mental institution has never been rescinded. 11. The FBI maintained daily surveillance of plaintiff for forty-three years, at a cost of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"many milIions of dollars. No charges have ever been brought. The FBI also conspired with the IRS to bring Plaintiff in on charges of tax delinquency. Each time, the IRS admitted there was no tax delinquency, because FBI agents forced employers to fire Plaintiff whenever he obtained a well-paying job, and there was no income to report. These difficulties have caused many observers to compare Plaintiff’s writing career with that of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who was exiled by the Soviet Communists. Plaintiff is now negotiating for a major movie studio production of these events. 12. Federal agents now extended their attack to Plaintiff’s relatives. Plaintiff’s father was attacked by federal agents in 1961 and died of a heart attack. Plaintiff’s mother an invalid, was harassed daily by federal agents until she died of a heart attack in 1971. Plaintiff continued to take care of his handicapped sister, Dorothy, who was harassed daily by federal agents until she died suddenly in 1979. Since then, Plaintiff has been alone in the world. Plaintiff was unable to get any media coverage of these murders, with the result that federal jackbooted thugs continued to run amuck in the United States, with the massacre of the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and the Waco Holocaust, in which an entire Christian congregation was burned alive in their church. The victims included many small babies. These horrors could have been averted if Plaintiff could have exposed the atrocities committed against his family by federal agents. 13. Explicacione : Any sentient person must suppose that the federal government had serious charges to bring against Plaintiff, to justify such furious persecution. In fact, Plaintiff has never had any problem with the federal government per se. A model citizen, Plaintiff served with distinction in the United States Army Air Force throughout World War II. Plaintiff’s record is unblemished. Plaintiff’s problem has never been with “the federal government” but with “the Nesher cell” (nesher is Hebrew for “eagle”) which Phil Klutznick encysted in the Department of Justice in 1936. Since then, it has taken over the entire Department, as have nesher cells in other federal agencies, such as the Boorda- Pollard Israeli espionage cell at the Navy Department. WHEREFORE, for these explicit reasons, Plaintiff filed this civil rights action for legal redress in State Court, and respectfully requests this Court to return this action to State Court for legal redress, because, in some fifty years, Plaintiff has never been able to obtain a civil rights hearing in a federal court.

I am very grateful to you all for printing this legal material, which I think will be helpful to many of our dissidents. As always I am on call to help anyone with legal advice. It was great to meet with you in Pasadena. I apologize for my poor physical condition which continued unabated until I returned home. I then had my cataract surgery which seems to be doing all right, and yesterday I went to a top orthopedic surgeon who X-rayed my game knee and declared it in perfect shape. He thinks it is a cartilage which wore down and got inflamed; it now seems to have corrected itself although it is still very sore. He didn’t even prescribe any medication which I would not have taken anyway. He did suggest an over-the-counter medication such as Advil; however, I saw the 20-20 program a few years ago which recounted without shock that 20,000 elderly people die each year from stomach bleeding from taking Advil. The manufacturer sunnily observed that “think of all that pain that was relieved by the pills!” I hope your mother is responding well to treatment. On my next trip West, Tehachapi is the top priority; after all I am not getting any younger. When I get my ten-million-dollar award from the conspirators I will be able to set up a headquarters here and you all can come and visit me. Looking forward to our next meeting, Eustace Mullins ***** UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS WESTERN SECTION EUSTACE C. MULLINS Plaintiff CIVIL ACTION No. 96CO30221-FHF v. THE BERKSHIRE EAGLE , Defendant. MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT Now comes the Plaintiff, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as Pro Propria Personae, and respectfully presents for the Court the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities. 1. Defendant has responded to Plaintiff’s Motion with the routine response that Plaintiff’s Motion is “rambling, incoherent and irrelevant”. This response is very encouraging to Plaintiff, because it reveals that Defendant still can offer no proper answer to Plaintiff’s charges since they were filed on October 25, 1996 with said answer due in twenty-one days from the time of filing. Defendant offers the Court no guidance in which words or phrases are rambling, which are incoherent, and which are irrelevant. “Rambling” and “incoherent” are terms of literary criticism which fail to address issues of fact in law and are not proper legal discourse. Defendant cannot properly answer Plaintiff because Defendant printed the evidence against itself on the front page of the Berkshire Eagle . The next step is a Motion for Summary Judgment. To date Defendant’s sole response is that every word in Plaintiff’s pleadings is totally incomprehensible to Defendant. According to the Oxford English Dictionary , “incoherent” is an 18th-century French word, and began to be used during the excesses of the French Revolution, when yelling madmen burned priests and nuns alive while chanting incoherently. The OED quotes Hobbes Leviathan , 1651, III XXXVI 224 “One that speaketh incoherently, as men that are distracted”, referring to incoherent as descriptive of spoken words; rather than written language. Plaintiff’s Motion made the point that in fifty years, federal courts have routinely denied Plaintiff a hearing in court, denied him a jury trial, and denied him the opportunity to present his evidence before an impartial judge. For Defendant to term this statement “irrelevant” reaches a new high in chutzpah. 2. Plaintiff’s action is part of a growing problem facing American courts -- the journalist as criminal. Graduating from a cheap flack paid to assassinate helpless assigned targets, the journalist criminal now sits in the highest circles of elitist power. We see Dick Morris, mastermind of the Clinton Administration with unlimited access to the White House, and also cousin of the unlamented Roy Cohn, who brought down Senator Joseph McCarthy’s"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"crusade against Communists in the U.S. Government. The case of Food Lion v. ABC network, in which the grocery chain won a multimillion dollar judgment against wealthy and arrogant journalists who had never before been in a grocery store (their servants did their shopping), because they faked libelous footage against a hapless food merchant, is particularly apropos to the present action. Federal District Judge N. Carlton Tilley Jr. ruled that “The First Amendment is a shield...not a sword.... The journalist’s privilege should not be expanded to allow the concealment of relevant evidence of wrongdoing solely because the wrongdoer was in pursuit of a story...” Conspiracy to produce faked evidence is the crux of Plaintiff’s action. Food Lion attorney Richard L. Wyatt stated “the illegal activities that Prime Time Live and its producers engaged in were only the beginning of the network’s misrepresentations about Food Lion.... How much faith can the public put in a story when the journalist or producer has lied all the way through in creating the story?... A free press is hobbled with trust between the media and the public it purports to serve.” Nation magazine notes Jan. 20, 1997 that in a like action a federal judge recently awarded a $10 million judgment against ABC. As attorney Wyatt states, “The media should have to obey the laws that everyone else must.” Plaintiff’s action demonstrates a remarkable correlation with another well known case, Richard Jewell, labelled the Mad Bomber of Atlanta after a bomb exploded at the Olympic Games. The FBI “leaked” information to the press in its routine campaign to destroy a victim before trial, convicting Jewell in the public mind as a crazed terrorist because he fit a “profile”. Unlike most FBI victims, Jewell refused to admit his guilt and accept a plea bargain. He continued to maintain his innocence, until the FBI and their co-conspirators in the media admitted there was no evidence against him. He is now collecting monetary awards from his persecutors, as Plaintiff will in the present action. 3. Plaintiff has been denied a hearing in federal court for some fifty years, apparently on principles enunciated in the famous case of Wayfield v. Tisbury, Mass. that “Wayfield identifies himself merely as a Christian European-American which is not a constitutionally protected class.” Courts generally accept the constitutionally protected classes, the only citizens who can make a claim of civil rights violations, as comprising: 1. women; 2. Blacks; 3. Jews; 4. Hispanics; and 5. homosexuals. Some claimants fit several of these defined categories, while those not in these categories are generally held to be disqualified to win a civil rights judgment in any American court. Plaintiff affirms that he is not a woman; he is not a Black; he is not a Jew; he is not a Hispanic; and he is not a homosexual. As a student of the Constitution , Plaintiff cannot find any of these constitutionally protected classes to whom justice has been reserved by the Constitution . Plaintiff asserts that he is due every constitutional protection afforded any other citizen of the United States and resident of the State of Virginia and demands that this action be remanded to state court where it originated, in order to avoid a court commitment to a quasi-theocratic standard of “diversity” which is in direct violation of the Constitution . 4. In defendant’s libelous assault against Plaintiff, defendant arbitrarily and without substantiation denounced Plaintiff as “a Holocaust denier” although it is a matter of record that Plaintiff has never mentioned the Holocaust anywhere in the Berkshire area, and that"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"defendant introduced this term as an integral part of its malicious campaign to injure and defame Plaintiff. To elitists of the New World Order “Holocaust denier” is a much more damaging term than “child molester” or “serial killer” because it is a secret code phrase meaning “an enemy who must be destroyed by any means possible”. By labelling Plaintiff a “Holocaust denier” defendant assigned itself the role of “Holocaust affirmer”, and is therefore required to substantiate its affirmation of the Holocaust in this action. Plaintiff requests Defendant to provide Plaintiff with the names, places of origin, and date, place and cause of death of the six million victims of the Holocaust. Failure to provide this information means that Defendant cannot affirm the Holocaust and that its denunciation of the Plaintiff as a “Holocaust denier” is a lie with the other lies in Defendant’s assault against Plaintiff. Further, Plaintiff requests the defendant to provide Plaintiff with the names of the eight million claimed Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, with place of residence, amount of reparations including all stipends formerly and presently received. This information is readily available at the United States Government official Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. It is particularly apropos to this action because Holocaust publications reveal that some 102 Holocaust survivors are now sitting judges in the United States. 1 enc.

Mullins ***** UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS EUSTACE C. MULLINS, Plaintiff v. THE BERKSHIRE EAGLE , Defendant Civil Action No. 96-30221-FHF PLAINTIFF’S NOTICE OF BIAS Now comes Plaintiff, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as Pro Propria Personae, to Notice the Court of the inherent bias against Plaintiff in the Order of January 24, 1997, as follows: 1. Time Sequence; The order of January 24, 1997, was delivered to Plaintiff nine days later by ordinary mail on the afternoon of February 1, 1997, requiring Plaintiff under Penalty of Dismissal to prepare a new complaint or More Definite Statement by February 11, 1997. This excessively brief time span came while Plaintiff was recovery from eye surgery and was incapacitated while faced with the daunting task of preparing a new complaint in a few days or be subject to Dismissal. 2. Pro Se. Plaintiff, appearing for himself, is Ordered to prepare said statement commensurate with the highest professional standards of legal writing, although Plaintiff without the aid of professional counsel is required to prepare a statement which will pass the scrutiny of opposing counsel. Opposing counsel has previously denounced all of Plaintiff’s pleadings in this action as “incoherent, rambling and irrelevant” while failing to identify a single word, phrase or sentence which meets this description, leaving Plaintiff in the dark as to how to write a Statement which will meet the censorship of opposing"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"counsel. By subjecting Plaintiff’s pleadings to the censorship of opposing counsel, the order effectively destroys the adversary system as we know it, because under the adversary system no opposing counsel will register approval of other party’s pleadings. 3. Motions; Plaintiff has submitted many motions to the court, none of which has been granted, but Defendant’s Motion was quickly granted and which included the Penalty of Dismissal. 4. Defendant’s assault against Plaintiff in the pages of the Berkshire Eagle claimed to be based upon Plaintiff’s fifty-year career of writing and lecturing, alleging that Plaintiff had written an article for a periodical which has been defunct for fifty years, yet Plaintiff is forbidden to bring this to the attention of the Court in a truncated Statement which must deal with his activities of fifty years and which does not allow him to answer Defendant’s assault. 5. The Order of January 24, 1997 is tailored to Defendant’s legal strategy in this action, which is, first, to deny Plaintiff the Jury Trial which he requested when he filed this action, and second, to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint without a court hearing. This strategy continues Defendant’s campaign to deny Plaintiff his civil rights under the law; by forcing Plaintiff to submit to the jurisdiction of the United States Magistrate Judge, which Plaintiff has refused to agree to, and placing Plaintiff under penalty of dismissal if he fails to place himself under the jurisdiction of the United States Magistrate Judge, while Defendant continues to refuse to answer the charges which Plaintiff brought against him on October 25, 1996.

Zionist ADL Monster -- Latest FBI Scandal Rocks Washington 02/18/97 Dear Rick, Many thanks for sending me your legal papers. I have spent quite a bit of time going over them, and my conclusion is that you have not counterattacked where your opponent is most vulnerable; that is, their standing to bring action against you. By standing I mean their background, who they are and what they represent. You are probably not aware that when Walter and Lao Russell bought the Dooley estate, Swannanoa, they knew no one here and faced many problems in moving in. The person who made it possible for them to move in and who worked with them was my father, Eustace Mullins, Sr. After Walter died, I met with Lao a number of times; she seemed, without openly saying so, receptive to my taking charge of the operation. However, I had so many other things going that it was not possible for me to do so. Exit Lao. Now we have a new crowd in control at the University of Science and Philosophy. The question must be asked legally, who are these people and how did they come to “own” this valuable property? They are not Walter and Lao Russell. Your attorneys should request all transactions between them and the estates of Walter and Lao Russell which placed them in command of this property. I know a lawyer in Waynesboro, J.B. Yount III, who I believe handled the legal details and cut himself into the action, for a fee, of course. This is probably your best line of defense; challenge their standing to bring the action against you. Otherwise you are a sitting duck lab for the judge’s contempt citation and sentencing. I will continue to study the situation and let you know if I can come up with anything else. At the moment this seems to be your only of action. I enclose my latest article on the FBI; it is very timely and should be applicable to the present situation, the Justice Dept. judges and FBI tailoring their “evidence” to whatever results the ADL demands. One of my best friends worked in the FBI lab; he was so disgusted that when he retired, he walked out of the FBI lab and never again during his lifetime came back or communicated with anyone; he had been there forty years!!"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Good luck on your hearing. With very best regards, /s/ Eustace C. Mullins P.S. I just received the February issue of Contact today; the Skolnick article on O.J. is right on target. This entire episode illustrates everything I have been writing about for fifty years, how the ADL runs Justice Dept. for its own sinister purposes. OJ was an ideal victim for them; even today he has not the slightest idea of what is going on. ***** Latest FBI Scandal Rocks Washington A front page story in the Washington Post , February 14, 1997, headlined problems at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's world-famed laboratory in Washington. The Post headline \"50 Cases Put In Jeopardy By FBI Lab\" included such current investigations as the Oklahoma Bombing case. Attorneys for Timothy McVeigh now believe that FBI labs errors and misconduct in this case make it unlikely that the federal government will ever be able to obtain a conviction. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of criminal cases must now be reviewed, retried, and convictions overturned because of flagrant FBI altering of evidence and withholding evidence from defendants' lawyers in criminal cases. INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT IS SEALED Despite efforts of Washington reporters to see it, the recent FBI Inspector General’s report on the FBI laboratory remains sealed. Its findings are believed to confirm that the FBI lab is at fault in “evidentiary problems created by questionable forensic analysis at the FBI laboratory, resulting in improper prosecutions”. Dep. Atty Gen. Jamie S. Gorelick blamed the problems at the lab on “poorly trained personnel and cramped quarters” which resulted in “contamination of evidence\". Because of alleged “contamination of evidence” in the O.J. Simpson case, he was acquitted of two brutal murders. Now federal courts face the nightmare of reopening hundreds of important cases which had previously resulted in convictions. The Washington Post , Feb. 14, 1997, noted that “The question of potential favoritism towards prosecutors in the FBI lab has been an issue for years.” To put it bluntly, the FBI lab provides the crucial findings which result in convictions. FBI agents, not scientists, head most major departments at the FBI laboratory. In 1988 and 1992, in answer to the growing criticism of the results produced by the FBI reports came to the conclusion that the entire laboratory had to be relocated from FBI headquarters because of inadequate space and obsolete equipment. Despite exaggerated claims that the FBI lab is the “world’s preeminent crime investigating laboratory”, the Post exposed the fact that this lab has never been accredited by the national authority, the American Society of Crime Lab Directors. Accreditation has never been possible because the FBI lab has rejected all external scrutiny for many years, pleading the excuse of “national security”, which is the favorite phrase of the FBI’s ingrown rat pack of insiders."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" WHISTLEBLOWER FIRED The latest crisis in the FBI, coming hard on the heels of an FBI agent arrested for espionage, and the one thousand purloined FBI files at the White House, which has yet to be adjudicated, was caused by one employee who refused to accept the notorious abuses of power at the FBI. Frederic Whitehurst protested for years at the inefficiency and continuous errors in forensic science which routinely occurred in the FBI lab. On January 24, 1997, he was ordered to turn in his gold FBI badge, No. 5150, and his Smith and Wesson revolver. He was placed on administrative leave, with pay, and forbidden to “enter any FBI building or facility”. He was also ordered to seek a psychiatric evaluation. A feature interview with Whitehurst in the Washington Post , Feb. 15, 1997, noted that “a penetrating Justice Dept. investigation of the FBI lab appears to have verified some of Whitehurst’s complaints.” To forestall further FBI action against him, Whitehurst has hired a lawyer and is suing the FBI. His wife Cheryl, who is also an FBI lab employee, has refused to leave. Because there are no charges against her, she cannot be fired. Who is this FBI forensic scientist (a specialist in crime investigation) who according to the FBI needs psychiatric care? Frederic Whitehurst has been with the FBI lab as a forensic scientist for the past ten years. He is 49 years old, and volunteered for three combat tours in Vietnam, winning many decorations. He has a doctoral degree from Duke University in Chemistry, and a law degree from Georgetown University. He had previously received many “Exceptional” evaluations from the FBI for his scientific work. (“Exceptional” is a very rare and infrequently conferred citation by the FBI.) Patsy Grant, deputy director of the Forensic Science Center at Livermore National Laboratory in California, who has worked with Whitehurst, is quoted as follows: “he is driven by a personal dedication to the truth.” The Whitehurst interview quoted him as saying, “some lab personnel put a premium on finding the results that prosecutors wanted and that reports were sometimes altered without the knowledge of the scientists who did the research .. some supervisors of the FBI lab had little or no expertise in science or in technical matters on which they were asked to make findings” ( Washington Post , Feb. 15, 1997). Here is a dedicated scientist complaining about interference from FBI bureaucrats. Despite his distinguished record, Whitehurst has been reclassified by FBI personnel as a “paint grade analysis trainee”! A STICKLER FOR ORDER The Washington Post states that Wilfred A. Armstrong, who worked with Whitehurst in the military intelligence unit of the Americal Division, said, “Everybody in the unit knew you didn’t screw around with Fred. He just didn’t allow slipshod in his life.” Whitehurst testified in one trial that several FBI investigators in the World Trade Center bombing inquiry concluded that the explosive device was urea nitrate-based, even though the assertion was impossible to prove because the substance is so common. To prove his point, Whitehurst testified, he took a urine sample, marked it as evidence and submitted it to an FBI lab examiner. The urine sample was identified by the FBI forensic expert as urea/nitrate. Whitehurst’s problems at the FBI laboratory were based solely on his refusal to accept the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"FBI employees’ self-evaluation that they were a law unto themselves, beyond all supervision, and willing to commit any illegal act with impunity. This was an attitude which had been deliberately fostered by its longtime Director, the late J. Edgar Hoover, and continued by his heirs at the Bureau. However, Hoover’s arrogance had been fed by his acts of intimidation and extortion against the leading politicians of Washington for almost fifty years. He maintained a Black Cabinet, with photographs and telephone taps of their sexual and financial peccadilloes. The result was that each year, when Hoover submitted his annual budget demand to Congress, it was passed without criticism or a single deletion. A SUCCESSION OF SCUMBAGS Hoover was succeeded at the FBI by a procession of scumbags, the worst that Washington had to offer. Although Hoover had amassed a large fortune in gold and rare jade artifacts from the Orient, worth ten million dollars, he refused to leave one cent to his many relatives in the Washington area, leaving the fortune to his longtime consort, Clyde Tolson, and a few other intimates at the FBI. They appraised the fortune at a hundred thousand dollars, and it soon disappeared without a trace. An opportune fire destroyed what records were left. FREEH THE DIRECTOR The present Director of the FBI, Louis Freeh (some believe the name was Freed), represents the lowest ebb of the procession of directors of the FBI, Freeh began his political career as a staff aide to the most notorious leftwing Senator in Washington, Senator Clifford Case of New Jersey. I campaigned actively against his re-election in 1956, but he was re-elected without serious opposition. Freeh then became an FBI agent. He was promoted to U.S. Attorney in New York, where he made the obligatory Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith connections, and was soon named a federal judge. The ADL boasts in its literature that it selects all federal judge candidates throughout the United States. Thus Freeh became the ideal candidate to carry on the time-honored Mafia, ADL and Mossad operations of the FBI, of which the two most notorious are the Weaver family massacre and the Waco Holocaust, in which an entire Christian congregation was burned alive in their Texas church. The Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah federal building was a logical sequence to this sordid history. I was quoted as stating that “The Oklahoma City bomb was a standard ADL-FBI operation” on the editorial page of the New York Times , without rebuttal. In Freeh, President Clinton found his most craven toady, a stooge who was willing to carry out any illegal act for his President. The one thousand purloined FBI files, which the White House requested on its Republican political critics, was a typical Freeh operation, one which has yet to be adjudicated. The Republicans seem strangely reluctant to press their advantage in this case, probably because they also refuse to expose the FBI in its basic role, as the hit squad for the Washington bureaucracy, which keeps not only the government employees, but also its potential critics, in line through the most blatant intimidation. SECRET POLICE POWERS"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"“ FBI Secrets, An Agent’s Expos é” by M. Wesley Swearingen, a 25-year veteran of the FBI, begins his revelations with an important quote from William C. Sullivan, longtime Number Two man at the FBI, and Hoover’s heir apparent: “During the ten years that I was on the U.S. lntelligence Board .. never once did I hear anybody, including myself, raise the questions, ‘Is this course of action which we have agreed upon lawful, is it legal, is it moral and ethical?’ The first thing we were concerned with was this: ‘Will this course of action work, will it get us what we want, will it reach the object we desire to reach?“’ When Sullivan insisted that J. Edgar Hoover set a date for his retirement, Hoover, who was then generally regarded by Washington insiders as hopelessly insane (see A WRIT FOR MARTYRS , by Eustace Mullins), immediately fired him, changed the locks on his office door, and forbade him from ever entering the FBI building. Sullivan, who knew all the secrets of the FBI establishment, died shortly afterwards in a mysterious “hunting accident”. It was claimed that he had been shot by a sixteen-year-old boy. Hoover himself later died of mysterious causes, listed as one of the more notorious “Washington heart attacks”. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE SHUT OUT After Hoover’s mysterious death, Peter W. Rodino, Jr., Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, assigned the General Accounting Office to audit the FBI files in 1974. The FBI refused the GAO all access to its files, but pre-selected some cases for them to examine. The GAO found that of 17,528 cases which the FBI had investigated, dealing with “internal security” only 533 were ever referred for prosecution, with a pathetic 1.3% rate of conviction. ORIGINS OF THE FBI CRIME LABORATORY Ronald Kessler, in his very useful work, The FBI (Pocket Books, New York, 1993), includes a chapter on the Lab Division of the FBI. He reveals that the famed FBI lab operates on a minuscule $56-million-a-year budget, from the overall FBI budget of more than two-billion dollars. Obviously, the FBI does not consider the laboratory a very essential operation. In fact, the FBI spends most of its budget on paid informants and sting operations, in which it bribes people to commit crimes for which they can then be prosecuted. Kessler says the FBI lab handles 20,000 cases a year during which it receives 170,000 pieces of evidence, and performs 900,000 examinations of that’ evidence. The FBI lab runs the entire polygraph operation, administering 20,000 polygraph examinations during the period from 1973 to 1993. It operates a large photo laboratory, builds exhibits for trials, and makes phony birth certificates, drivers licenses and passports for agents to use during their investigations. Kessler claims that “Today the lab is recognized as the most comprehensive and objective forensic lab in the world.” Frederic Whitehurst is unlikely to agree with that assessment. In 1987, Director William Sessions authorized the FBI lab to become the pioneer in DNA analysis. Television monitors at the FBI lab record every television program broadcast in the United"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"States, twenty-four hours a day, on VCRs. The FBI laboratory began its operations on November 24, 1932 as a very modest operation, with one microscope, and an ancient black Packard which had been nicknamed “Old Beulah”. HOOVER SET HIGH STANDARDS The FBI laboratory’s sacrosanct reputation is in large part another legacy from J. Edgar Hoover. From the outset, he insisted on the highest standards of accuracy in the laboratory, because he did not want the Bureau to be criticized for sloppy work. He was horrified when his agents informed him that State Supt. of Police for New Jersey, Schwarzkopf and State Attorney General David Wilentz, had manufactured extensive evidence against Gerhart Haupmann in the Lindbergh kidnapping case (documented in the book, Scapegoat , by Anthony Scaduto). Although the conspirators succeeded in sending Haupmann to the electric chair, involving Lindbergh himself in perjury in the process, Hoover vowed he would never let the Bureau become involved in such a travesty. Long after his death, the political hacks who succeeded him, eager to curry favors with the politicians in Washington, proved their willingness to manufacture or alter evidence to produce any desired result, until Frederic Whitehurst blew the whistle on their machinations. Despite his many faults, J. Edgar Hoover always provided a high degree of leadership at the FBI. Agents were expected to follow his cult of personality. Hoover was the unchallenged Leader. Norman Ollestad, in his book, Inside the FBI (Lyle Stuart Co., NY, 1967), cites a typical agent’s indoctrination speech by Special Agent Jess Doyle. “J. Edgar Hoover is an inspiration to us all. The sunshine of his presence lights our way.” Doyle told the agents that the FBI only accepted one out of every six thousand applicants. Because of his double life, J. Edgar Hoover was constantly engaged in a public relations battle to protect his image and the image of the FBI, which were synonymous. His greatest triumph came in 1956 when Random House sold millions of copies of Don Whitehead’s The FBI Story , an unabashed piece of puffery which was later made into a movie and a long-running television series starring James Stewart as, you guessed it, the gallant Director of the FBI. In Whitehead’s Preface, he writes, “I found in the FBI story a strong American adventure of pioneering in the frontiers of law enforcement and national security. This is the struggle to achieve incorruptible enforcement of the law by professionals trained to protect civil rights.” HIS OWN PRESS AGENT In the early 1930s, J. Edgar Hoover had hired a press agent to promote the FBI in the public mind. He soon found that the reporters no longer called him; they called the press agent. He immediately fired his agent, and from then on acted as his own very successful press agent. No one else was ever allowed to speak for the FBI during his lifetime. Even his consort of thirty-five years, Clyde Tolson, was never allowed to give an interview. One Senator complained that Hoover was determined to staff the entire FBI with Clyde Tolson look alikes. The great majority of the agents, like Tolson, were clean cut, all-American types. Hoover never hired a black or female agent during his tenure."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" OMERTA The distinguishing characteristic of Hoover’s dominance at the FBI was “the code of silence”. Known as “omerta”, this Mafia code forbade anyone to ever speak or testify against a fellow member. It was this code of omerta which Frederic Whitehurst violated when he went public with the alteration and falsification of evidence in the FBI Laboratory. One book about the FBI, Agents of Repression , by Ward Churchill and Jim Vande Wall (South End Press, Boston, 1988), contains an entire chapter, Chapter 11, titled “Perjury and Fabrication of Evidence”. Throughout his years at the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover had surrounded himself with the most servile, fawning toadies. Without an orderly succession of leadership, the FBI has been floundering ever since, although no one could have predicted the depths to which it has sunk with Louis Freeh as director, or his equally fawning superior, Attorney General Janet Reno. Both of them spend most of their time in their offices waiting for a call from the White House. “Lou, better send me over another thousand FBI files.” “Yes, sir,” responds Lou. Although these flunkies represent “leadership” at the FBI, the Bureau has actually been run by a small group of Hoover cronies since his death. Such is the mystique of Hoover’s legacy that Republican leaders in Washington still accept without reservation the “untouchability” of the FBI. In reality, the FBI has never been an autonomous agency. Since Phil Klutznick set up a secret “nesher” cell at the Department of Justice in 1936 (nesher means “eagle” in Hebrew, symbolizing Zionist interests), the FBI has been totally at the beck and call of the Anti-Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, a Jewish Masonic group which is the only terrorist organization allowed to operate without hindrance throughout the United States. The ADL works closely with Mossad, Israeli Intelligence, and is the focal point of more than six hundred Zionist organizations, all tax exempt by the IRS, to aid the State of Israel and promote Zionist activities in the United States. “But isn’t this illegal,” asks Naive Reader. It is illegal to represent foreign interests without registration, but when you control the FBI, who is going to investigate wrongdoing? A PERSONAL NOTE This writer and his family were, for some fifty years, primary victims of FBI harassment in the notorious “COINTELPRO” (counter-intelligence program), which the ADL persuaded J. Edgar Hoover to set up in the early 1950s. In Chicago in 1957, I challenged one of the hordes of FBI agents who staked out my apartment. “I won’t talk to you because you are simply carrying out the orders of the ADL,” I told them. “Oh, no,” replied the fat agent who seemed to be in charge, \"we don’t work for the ADL.” I then found that I had an 800- page personal file at FBI headquarters in Washington. After years of application, I received 500 pages of this file through personal intervention of my Senator from Virginia. The other 300 pages have been withheld ever since, after senior FBI officials decided that to release this material would “endanger national security\". I reopened this application in 1996 and was informed it would be four years before the FBI could even consider my request. I replied that Hillary didn’t have to wait four years!"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"After years of court battles, I obtained two default judgments against the FBI in federal court. The details, including 120 pages of my FBI file, are reproduced in A WRIT FOR MARTYRS by Eustace Mullins. FUTURE OF THE FBI It is difficult to predict the future of the FBI, because it actually has no past. Most citizens do not realize that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not set up by the Founding Fathers, and it is a violation of the Constitution , Art. 1, Sec. 4 (See “ THE GREAT BETRAYAL ”, by Eustace Mullins). The United States became the most prosperous country in the world before international conspirators saddled it with the FBI, the Federal Reserve System, and the Marxist progressive income tax. Since then, we have plunged precipitously towards national disaster, always with the eager participation of our politicians in the Democratic Federal Reserve Party and the Republican Federal Reserve Party. Frederic Whitehurst’s revelations, as well as the other crimes of the FBI, including the ADL promotion of the Ruby Ridge Massacre and the Waco Holocaust, should signal the end of the FBI. This cannot occur as long as it has its eager defenders on Capitol Hill, the jackals and hyenas whose shrieks of laughter echo their contempt for the working people of the United States. The upcoming Oklahoma City bombing trial, if it ever takes place, may signal the last days of the FBI. It cannot come too soon. AUTHOR’S NOTE : The preceding article is a chapter from Eustace Mullins’ forthcoming history of the FBI, to appear in Sept. 1997. ************************************************ 25.) Waco Is Still Burning 04/24/97 Why hasn’t Janet Reno been arrested? Why have no federal officials involved in the Waco Holocaust been indicted for their crimes? These are the burning questions raised by an important new film, which recently rated a full two-page spread in the Washington Post , and which was extensively covered in other newspapers. This film, Waco: The Rules of Engagement , was first shown at the Sundance Film Festival. “ The Rules of Engagement ” was an FBI fiction cooked up to justify the murder raid on the Christian family Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992. The FBI agents coolly shot a little boy in the back as he tried to run home for safety, after he found that they had cold-bloodedly shot his dog to keep the pet from warning the family of the murderous intruders. Then the FBI called in their top sniper, Horimuchi, to drill the little boy’s mother through the forehead with a single shot. Her crime? She was holding what the FBI claimed was a dangerous weapon --it was her little baby that she cradled in her arms as she looked out to see what was happening to her"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"family. Top FBI officials then solemnly testified that they were acting under “the rules of engagement”. They were never prosecuted for these murders. The worst was yet to come. In early 1993, hordes of heavily-armed Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents descended upon a small Christian church near Waco, Texas. According to Newsweek , four of their agents were killed in a deadly crossfire of their own making; the terrified Christians did not even return fire. Seeing that they were hopelessly outnumbered, with huge Army tanks lumbering towards their church, and helicopter gunships flying overhead and saturating the entire church with deadly gunfire, the Christians hoped that if they offered no resistance, the murder raid might be called off. It was not to be. A 51-day siege ensued; then an order came from the White House, “Finish it!” The FBI calmly announced that the more than eighty victims, including many small babies, had deliberately set themselves, on fire and perished. The agents, completely backed up in their vicious falsehoods by Reno and other top officials of the deadly Clintonista Administration, were also backed up by Republican Congressional leaders, who conducted a whitewash of the Waco Holocaust. The new film, Waco; The Rules Of Engagement , proves that they all lied to cover up this atrocity. FORWARD-LOOKING INFRARED A supervisor and systems analyst for the Army’s night vision laboratory, Edward Allard, is quoted in the Richmond Times Dispatch , April 20, 1997, as finding in this documentary film automatic weapon fire from the FBI. This deadly fire was aimed at a single exit door from the concrete storage room in the church where the FBI had listened to David Koresh directing the women and children to huddle for safety. Knowing the precise location of the women and children, the FBI could have called a cease-fire, and urged the women and children to exit without harm from this door. BUT THE FILM SHOWS THAT TO PREVENT THEM FROM ESCAPING CERTAIN DEATH, THE FBI AGENTS POURED HEAVYFIRE AGAINST THIS DOOR, SO THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO ESCAPE! This was your tax dollars at work. With his unparalleled experience in detecting automatic fire on film, Allard said, “There is nothing in nature with that kind of signature,” as he pinpointed the bursts of automatic fire on the film. What do these recorded bursts of FBI gunfire prove? According to some commentators, that the FBI either received direct orders to exterminate the Christians, or that, overcome with hatred, they decided on their own to make sure that no women or children escaped their holocaust. This is the atrocity of which the Post directly quotes Resident Clinton’s sneering comment to reporters after the tragedy, \"a bunch of religious fanatics decided to kill themselves”. (Quoted in the Washington Post , April 18, 1997.) And what of Janet Reno, our esteemed Attorney General, sworn to uphold law and order throughout the United States? The Post states the following: “Nine days after the debacle at Waco, Attorney General Reno told a House Judiciary Committee hearing, to the great credit of the FBI, they received substantial fire from within the compound .. without returning any fire.” The film convicts Reno of perjury before a Congressional Committee. She claims the FBI did not return fire."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"In Edward Allard’s suburban home near Washington, a portrait of Jesus is prominently featured in the living room. He is a lifelong Catholic who is described by the Post as “a man of conviction and certitude”. For many years he supervised the Department of Defense’s night vision laboratory at nearby Fort Belvoir. He plays the Waco film for the Post reporters in slow motion, counting 44 distinct flashes where a team of FBI agents is firing at the escape door behind which cower the women and children of the church. “Right there, something terrible happens,” he says. He has agreed to appear as an expert witness in a civil lawsuit filed by attorneys for the families of the massacred Christians. Former attorney general Ramsay Clark filed a motion last October, stating that Allard’s analysis “leaves no doubt that the U.S. repeatedly fired gunshots into the church and at its Occupants.” A year ago, when this testimony surfaced, the FBI “persuaded” the nationally-seen program Sixty Minutes to cancel a documentary revealing this evidence in the Waco Holocaust. The present 165-minute Waco documentary is a million dollar production, produced by CNN newsman Dan Gifford, his wife Amy, and Mike McNulty, who has spent years in an expensive and time-consuming effort to pinpoint what actually happened at Waco. The film contains FBI negotiation audio tapes, home videos made by the Branch Davidians, and C-SPAN footage from official Congressional hearings. Despite Edward Allard’s intensive background in night defense analysis, the Post refused to accept his observations without backup. They found ample testimony from other experts which verified Allard’s conclusions. An El Paso Consultant on firearms evidence, and a former Los Angeles sheriffs deputy, Joseph Horn, said, “The gunfire signatures are real,” after he observed the Waco film. “The pattern of the firing were there:” Other experts in FLIR (Forward-Looking Infrared), which was widely used during the Desert Storm military operations to detect enemy tanks and installations, included Ron Smith, of Tempe, Arizona, who said he counted seven separate instances of automatic weapons fire on the tape, which was directed at the church. The Post quoted Tom Simpson, a computer imaging specialist in Camarillo, Calif. who trained military officials on how to read FLIR, said, “We observed no less than 60 of what can only be explained as gunfire energy bursts .. all directed at the compound. We took great pain to explain these events in another fashion .. but were unable to find that explanation.” When the Waco film was shown before liberal Hollywood elitists at Robert Redford’s exclusive Sundance Festival, the viewers were shocked. None of them have made any public comment on what they saw. They knew they were looking at irrefutable evidence of the worst hate crime in American history, the massacre of a church group committed to solving the ancient mystery of the Seven Seals as mentioned in the Book of Revelation . For this quest, they paid with their lives, gunned down by the most massive military operation ever recorded in the State of Texas. As Chairman of the national Waco Holocaust Memorial Commission, I intend to show the Waco film daily when our memorial building is completed on the Washington Mall. There is no doubt that the perpetrators of this massacre will be punished. It is your and my sacred duty to pursue justice in this matter. We will never forget Waco.

It is the epitome of government terrorism, the same type of terrorism carried out by Josef Stalin and his Bolshevik cohorts when they massacred one million Christians each year in Russia from the years 1917 to 1967. There is little doubt that the Waco Holocaust was carried out by Josef Stalin’s willing minions in Washington, through the subversive terrorist groups he set up in the United States. Principal among these is the Anti-Defamation League, and its subsidiary organization, the Cult Awareness Network, (CAN) which the ADL has now allowed to quietly vanish from the scene. American Justice Forever! ************************************************ 26.) Sigmund Freud: Antichrist Devil 05/10/97 Few Americans realize that the principal tool of Communist penetration in the United States is the pseudo-science of psychotherapy. Not only have many patriots who opposed Communist subversion been imprisoned for life without trial, but many others have been rendered helpless, their fortunes seized, and their exposures of Communist treachery discredited by the accusation of “mental illness”. In 1848, Karl Marx issued his Communist Manifesfo , detailing the Jewish plans for subduing the gentile, but it was not until 1896 that the most workable system to achieve this goal, “psychoanalysis”, was unveiled by his fellow-Jew Sigmund Freud. No one suspected at the time that Freud (pronounced Fraud) had invented the indispensable tool for the biological parasite in his quest to gain absolute control over the life of the gentile host. Psychoanalysis became the instrument which the Jew used to probe the deepest recesses of the mind of the host, thereby learning his best secrets, as well as the hidden fears and doubts which could be exploited by a clever enemy in order to become his master. Beginning his career as a medical student, Freud concentrated on the study of the nervous system, obtaining a degree in neuropathology. Up to this point, his education had been strictly scientific, conducted according to methodical Teutonic principles of study in the Vienna Medical School. He now abandoned these principles. For the rest of his life, he would be the typical Jewish adventurer, seeking one path after the other until he hit upon the one which would lead him to fame, riches and, more important than either of these to the Jew, power over the gentile host. For several years, Freud experimented with “cocaine therapy” or, as a policeman might put it, drug peddling. The only outcome of this was that he himself became a convert, and continued to use cocaine throughout his life. Even today, cocaine is the favored drug of the wealthy and influential Jews in New York and Hollywood who control the minds of the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"American people through television and the news media. They are loyal to cocaine solely because it was the drug of their master, Sigmund Freud. After Freud discovered that putting his patients on cocaine brought him no sudden wealth or prominence, he began to cast about for some quicker road to fortune. He seemed to have found it when he began to practice hypnosis on his patients. For more than a century, hypnosis had been the favorite practice of Europe’s most notorious charlatans, Mesmer, Cagliostro, and Charcot. Freud now became the legitimate heir of these mountebanks. But how did he escape being branded by their well deserved reputations as necromancers and frauds? Early in his use of hypnosis, he made the fortunate discovery that it was no longer necessary to put his patients “under”, or to subject them to hypnosis in order to get them to reveal their innermost secrets. He had only to establish a suitable atmosphere of confidence and trust, and they would begin to talk about themselves. As Thomas Szasz, the famed critic of this pseudo-science, revealed in his book, THE MYTH OF PSYCHOTHERAPY , “Psychotherapy is merely talking.” Freud’s reputation as the great inventor of an entire new science rests solely on his discovery that he could get his patients to talk about themselves without the use of hypnosis. Nevertheless, much of the mumbo-jumbo of psychotherapy was invented in order to create a hypnotic atmosphere. Freud’s discovery freed him from the stigma of the charlatans of hypnosis, and put a great distance between him and his discredited predecessors such as Mesmer, the father of Mesmerism. Nevertheless, the practice of psychoanalysis depends heavily on creating and maintaining a pseudo-hypnotic atmosphere in the psychiatrist’s office. The patient must be persuaded to relax, to place himself completely in the power of the psychiatrist, and to reveal his innermost self. Thus the pseudoscience of psychotherapy functions only because it is pseudo-hypnosis. No wonder that Freud is pronounced Fraud! Once he had broken away from the unsavory reputation of his predecessors, and had put the stigma of charlatanism behind him, Fraud began to build an elaborate facade of intellectual supports for his new “science” of psycho-therapy. This proved to be a difficult task, for, as Szasz has pointed out, psycho-therapy is merely talk. It would not be easy to erect a vast superstructure of scientific procedures around the basic principle of a patient lying on a couch and chatting about himself to a listening doctor. Nevertheless, Freud, exhibiting all of the talent of his race for bewildering and misleading the gentile host, proceeded to do just that. He devised a “system” based upon incorrect and often obscene theories, using these theories to attack the basis of all family life by such developments as the “Oedipus complex”. Not only has an “Oedipus complex” never existed, but Freud either completely misunderstood or more likely, purposely misrepresented, the entire basis of this “complex\". He based it upon an ancient Greek myth, the story of Oedipus. Although he first advanced the theory of the Oedipus complex in 1910, it was not until 1920 that he published three essays which purported to establish the foundations for this theory, the projection of “infantile sexuality”."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"It has been said that the Oedipus complex is the nuclear complex of the neuroses and constitutes the most important part of their content, because this complex, appearing early in life, is the basis for all later neuroses. It represents the peak of infantile sexuality, which Freud claims appears in the first year of infancy, and forever after molds the nervous structure of the adult. In fact, there is not the slightest evidence that “infantile sexuality” reaches its peak in the first year of life, or that there is even such a phenomenon as infantile sexuality. Of course, this did not bother Freud. If there were no such thing as infantile sexuality, he would invent it. He built the Oedipus complex by tacking his pet sexual obsessions onto the myth of an ancient Greek King, Laius of Thebes. When Laius consulted the Delphic Oracle to divine his future, he was told that a child born to him and his wife Jocasta would become his murderer. A son, Oedipus, was born to him, and he had the child set out to die on Mt. Cithaeron. Years later, Oedipus, who had been rescued and brought up by a kindly shepherd who found him lying there, met Laius on a narrow path. After a quarrel as to who had the right of way, they fought, and Oedipus killed him. He continued on to the city of Thebes, where he met Laius’ widow, Jocasta, who was also his mother, and married her. The shepherd then appeared, and revealed the true origin of Oedipus, who was overcome by remorse. He blinded himself, while Jocasta hanged herself. This legend, typical of its overtones of traditional Greek tragedy, had deep implications that we must become aware of our identity if we are to lead satisfactory lives, but Freud showed no understanding of this. Instead, he completely distorted the legend by claiming that every male child, even in the first year of infancy, as it writhes in torments of infantile sexuality, is bedeviled by jealousy of the father, whom the child wants to kill so that he can have sex with his mother. Only a Jew could bring to a traditional myth such perversion and such distortion. As Szasz points out, the Freudian elements, jealousy of the father and the desire to have intercourse with the mother, are completely lacking in the original myth. Donald Wormell, writing in the Encyclopedia Britannica , notes that the Freudian interpretation has no similarity to the classical Greek story, because Oedipus as an infant had no jealousy of his father, whom he did not know, or any desire to have intercourse with his mother, whom he did not know. Despite these inconsistencies, Freud claimed that much of the neurosis of the twentieth century was caused by the Oedipus complex. The frustration of the infant, being unable either to kill the father or to have sex with the mother, became \"repressed”, and was thus mentally affected for the rest of his life. This tissue of distortions, falsities, and perversions became the cornerstone of Freud’s entire “science” of psychotherapy. Freud’s reputation as “the father of psychoanalysis” rests upon the Oedipus complex. The second foundation of the Freudian system is Freud’s “theory of repressed homosexuality”. Early in the course of his hypnotic treatment of patients, Freud had encountered a number of wealthy and dissolute aristocrats who, wearying of the usual vices of drug addiction, gambling and alcoholism, had taken up the practice of sexual perversion. After “treating” a number of these perverts, whose real problem was not so much their “homosexuality” as their boredom and their ability to spend as much money as they wished to purchase partners for their perverted acts, Freud decided that \"homosexual impulses” were universal among men. Why, then, did not most men engage in homosexual acts?"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Freud had a ready answer for this: They “repressed” their homosexual impulses. Now that he had created the problem, Freud had only to erect a “scientific” foundation for it. This proved to be a simple task for one of his racial duplicity and lack of morals. He appropriated the greatest figure of Western culture, Leonardo da Vinci, to carry the banner of his new theory. Freud decided that Leonardo da Vinci must have been a homosexual. Da Vinci had once been brought before a court on a charge of homosexuality, and had been acquitted. No other evidence existed that he had been a homosexual, and it had been several centuries since anyone had been around who could testify about it one way or the other. But Freud, the Jewish mountebank, found this important in order to denigrate da Vinci because he was a great non-Jewish artist. After a notable lack of success in his efforts to find any basis for his theory that da Vinci had been a homosexual, Freud finally came upon a rather dubious recording of a faint childhood memory, in which Leonardo da Vinci wrote that a vulture came down to his cradle and struck him in the mouth with his tail. Eureka! Freud had found what he had been looking for. He immediately interpreted this childhood memory, or dream, as an illustration of Leonardo’s “passive homosexuality”. Flimsy though this basis was, it became the cornerstone of Freud’s theory of universal repressed homosexuality among men. Unfortunately, as Freud’s disciples have desperately sought to conceal for many years, Thomas Szasz reveals that Freud’s entire theory was wrong because of his defective scholarship. He had based his theory on a German text in which the translator had incorrectly translated Leonardo’s word for “toy kite” as a “vulture”. The tail of a toy kite had dragged across Leonardo’s cradle and brushed him. Freud, relying upon the wrong translation of the kite as a vulture, devised a complicated sexual theory by which Leonardo’s memory of the bird’s tail touching his mouth had been the conscious fulfillment of his subconscious homosexual desires! From a wrong understanding, Freud now erected a vast superstructure of Leonardo’s entire art and, subsequently, the art of the Western nations being created from his homosexual nature. In so doing, Freud unleashed a terrible weapon against Western civilization. Single- handedly, he created the enormous problem of the “gay” communities which plague America today. By identifying the greatest artist of Western culture as a homosexual, Freud gave an aura of respectability to a sexual deviation. By his claim that all men have “repressed” homosexual desires, he unleashed a torrent of sexual acts and a great blow against established family life. Young men who not only are searching for a career but who also have doubts about their sexual identity have only to abandon themselves to Freud’s theories, and they can, simultaneously release all their “sexual repressions”, thus avoiding the danger of terrible neuroses, but they can become great artists as well. Only a Jew could have unleashed such a poisonous theory on the gentile community to further confuse and destroy it. Despite Freud’s theories, scientists today have begun to doubt that there really is such a thing as a “homosexual impulse”. Instead, they lean to the finding that there are sexual impulses which, in the absence of a member of the opposite sex, tend to turn to a member of the same sex, as in prison, the army or private schools. Such a finding, of course, is devastating to the “gay” community, which has sought to turn"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"perverse impulses into a modern religion. We could be accused of oversimplification if we sought to condemn the entire “science” of psycho-therapy because its two principal foundations, Freud’s theory of repressed homosexuality and the Oedipus complex, have been shown to be little more than the products of his cocaine-stimulated imagination. Realizing from the outset that Freud’s theories might be subject to serious challenge, later practitioners of psychotherapy have sought to erect an even more complex superstructure of psychological theories to bolster their basic technique of “talk”. In this campaign, they have produced millions of words, but not a single workable theory. As Thomas Szasz points out: “Psychotherapy is secular ethics. It is the religion of the formally irreligious -- with its language which is not Latin but medical jargon; with its codes of conduct, which are not ethical but legalistic; and with its theology, which is not Christianity, but positivism.” For several years, before fixing upon his theories of psychotherapy, Freud had experimented with various other “treatments”, such as electrotherapy, baths and massages. The German Dr. Wilhelm Erb (1840-192l), in his Hundbuch der Elektrotherapie , described his technique for applying electric shock to the genitals, which later became a favorite form of torture in Latin America. Erb “assumed” that the victims on whom he practiced this technique had “neurosis”. During World War I, the most notorious practitioner of electric shocks was Dr. Julius Wagner-Jauregg, professor of psychiatry at the Vienna Medical School and a former teacher of Freud. Wagner-Jauregg was fond of using heavy doses of electric shock on soldiers who suffered nervous breakdowns during artillery barrages in combat zones. Despite heavy criticism, Wagner-Jauregg continued to use electric shock on soldiers throughout the war. Freud defended him against his critics, calling the soldiers “malingerers”. In 1920, the Austrian War Ministry, in response to the public outcry against Wagner- Jauregg, conducted a lengthy investigation of his mistreatment of soldier patients. Freud wrote a long memorandum defending Wagner-Jauregg’s torture technique of electrotherapy. “I know,” wrote Freud in Wagner-Jauregg’s defense, “that the motivating force in his treatment of patients is his humaneness”. This was a typical Jew view of humaneness. Electrotherapy was later replaced by chemotherapy, although Freud continued to use some electrotherapy on his patients. He explained it as “pretense treatment”, which he used to”keep in touch” with his patients. Throughout his career, Freud was obsessed by sexual imaginings, which ranged from the ludicrous to the obscene. In one of his letters to Ludwig Binswanger, he wrote: “I have always lived on the ground floor in the basement of the building .. I already found one for religion when I stumbled on the category ‘neurosis of mankind’.” One of his last writings (July 12, 1938) contained this “gem”: “As a substitute for penis-envy, identification with the clitoris; neatest expression of inferiority, source of all inhibitions.” During the erecting of his psychotherapy empire, Freud was on the lookout for a suitable"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"heir apparent. At one time he had selected a young non-Jewish doctor, Jung, after quarreling with his Jewish disciples. Jung spent much time with him, but found himself unable to accept Freud’s wild theories, and he finally dismissed Freud’s work as “too Jewish”. In MEMORIES, DREAMS AND REFLECTIONS , Jung wrote (p. 149): “Above all, Freud’s attitude towards the spirit seems to me highly questionable. Wherever in a person or in a work of art, an expression of spirituality (in the intellectual, not the supernatural senses) came to light, he suspected it, and insinuated that it was repressed sexuality.” It took Jung several years to realize that the earth-bound Jew was unable to comprehend anything spiritual, having to interpret it in the grossest physical sense, and he finally parted company with him. It was Thomas Szasz, in THE MYTH OF PSYCHO-THERAPY , who writes most revealingly of Freud’s creation of “the science of psychotherapy” as an instrument of the Jew to be used to gain power over the gentiles. Szasz titled his chapter, “Sigmund Freud, the Jewish Avenger\". Freud himself was born a Jew, was given the Jewish name of Schlomo after his grandfather, a rabbi, and remained a Jew. Szasz further comments: “The inconsistency between Freud’s passionate anti-religious tirades and his profound commitment to Jewishness significantly highlights an important aspect of Freud’s personality and predilections, namely, his anti-gentilism. The popular image of Freud as an enlightened, emancipated irreligious person who, with the aid of psychoanalysis, ‘discovered’ that religion is a mental illness is pure fiction.” Szasz then defines the Freudian psyche permanently by writing: “Freud was throughout his life, a proud, chauvinistic, even vengeful Jew.” Thus Freud’s famed “irreligiousness” was merely his anti-Christian, anti-gentile bias. In his “science” of psychoanalysis, Freud focused the hatred of centuries which the biological parasite had cultivated against the host, a hatred irreconcilably rooted in the biological situation of the parasite that must live off the host, and that can have no existence without this relationship. Certainly the State of Israel typifies this relationship, as the entire budget of Israel is built on “loans”, “grants”, “gifts”, and the sale of worthless Israeli bonds. David Bakan writes of Freud’s Jewishness: “Freud believed that anti-Semitism was practically ubiquitous in either latent or manifest form; the broad masses of England were anti-Semitic ‘as everywhere’; he refused to accept royalties of Hebrew and Yiddish translations of his works; he was sympathetic to Zionism"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"from the first days of the movement and was acquainted with and respected Herzl. (Editor’s note: Herzl died of syphilis, his entire dream of a Jewish empire in Palestine being the product of the decaying brain of a Jew in the last and most violent stages of paresis). Freud’s son was a member of the Kadimah, a Zionist organization, and Freud himself was an honorary member of it.” Szasz further notes: “In addition, Freud displayed his devotion to Judaism in the letters he wrote, the friends and enemies he made, and, last but not least, in his anti-gentilism. His interpretations of Western civilization, Oedipus was not a king, but a complex; Leonardo was not a heroic painter but a homosexual pervert.” The final statement of Szasz on Freud’s racial bias is the most important (p.146). “One of Freud’s most powerful motives in his life was the desire to inflict vengeance on Christ.” At last we get to the meat of the matter! Psychoanalysis is the creation of a hate-filled Jew whose life was devoted to vengeance against Christ. Could any more definitive analysis of the satanic origins of “the science of psychotherapy*’ be made? The sick theories of this modern anti-Christ did not long remain theories. They were quickly put to use by the Jews, not only in treating the “mentally ill”, but in the techniques of attaining and holding political power. The psychiatrists, interviewing the patients, most of them from wealthy and influential gentile families, learned trade secrets and political information invaluable to the Jewish dreams of enslaving the gentiles. These secrets were quickly turned to advantage in their war against the Christians. They spawned a host of “psychiatrists” that rapidly infested all of the gentile nations, and then turned up as the directors of mental institutions. The hapless patient who revealed an attitude critical of the Jews, or who was even suspected of such thoughts, was treated mercilessly. The mental institutions provided the Jews with the ideal laboratory for their wildest dreams of power over the non Jews. They now had an endIess supply of victims, completely helpless, whose screams would never be heard by the outside world. What tortures, what murders, have gone on in these institutions in the fifty years since the Freudians took over their operations can only be imagined. Most of the victims will never talk -- they are dead. The survivors are “insane”; their stories of their sufferings at the hands of the Jews are merely the products of disordered minds. Nevertheless, we do know that not even the highest government officials have been immune from Freudian “correction” when they strayed from Jewish programs. We have only to remember that when our first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, hesitated to commit our entire military power to the support of the State of Israel, within a few hours he suffered a “breakdown”. He was taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital and soon went out the window to his death. In April 1936, Congressman Marion Zioncheck, denounced J. Edgar Hoover on the floor of Congress. Already known as a “maverick”, Zioncheck had gone too far. Soon afterwards, he was taken under mysterious circumstances to a Washington, D.C., mental hospital, St. Elizabeth’s (where the patriot Ezra Pound was held as a political"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"prisoner for thirteen years without trial, and then released because of pressure from his friends). Zioncheck was kept incommunicado at St. Elizabeth’s, and treated by several of the nation’s leading psychiatrists. After several attempts to escape, he was released in what his friends described as a “drugged, zombie-like condition”. He returned to Seattle, and soon fell to his death from the fifth floor of the Arctic Building. The verdict was suicide, but most people interviewed in Seattle believed he had been pushed. He was succeeded by Warren G. Magnuson, who enjoyed a long political career in Washington, and who was very careful not to offend the Jews. Shortly after the Crash of 1929, when many gentiles had been impoverished by Jewish money manipulation, the psychiatrists began to show their hands as the new masters. In May, 1930, an International Congress on Mental Hygiene was held in Washington, D.C. Four thousand psychiatrists from fifty-three countries were welcomed by the President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. The new masters drafted a charter stating that they alone had the knowledge to “understand and control human behavior .. Psychiatry must now decide what is to be the immediate future of the human race.” The new pronouncement also boasted that “Psychiatrists alone possess the superior intelligence and knowledge to alter materially and permanently human behaviors.” Many of the bureaucrats got the message, and promptly signed up for lengthy series of “analysis”. Soon afterwards, a number of Communist cells were established in the government bureaus, chief among them the Harold Ware cell. Ware was merely the office boy for Felix Frankfurter, who masterminded this Communist group, placing Communist agents high in the official levels of every government department in Washington. One of the principal speakers at the Washington Congress of Psychiatrists was Dr. Donald A. Nicholson, a psychiatrist from Seattle who was the president of the Washington State Medical Assn. Nicholson was later to examine Congressman Zioncheck shortly before his “suicide”. He committed thousands of Americans to mental hospitals, all of them on his unsupported testimony that they were “insane”. Few of them ever saw freedom again. His most famous victim was the great Hollywood actress Frances Farmer. Frances who? A curtain of silence has been rung down on one of America’s greatest talents. When she flashed across the Hollywood screen, she became known as “the American Garbo”. Today her movies are never shown on television or in the theatres. Those Hollywood figures who knew her refuse to mention her name. They are terrified that they, too, might have to endure the sufferings visited on her. What happened to Frances Farmer? A reporter spent five years investigating her story, which he recently published, Shadowland . As a beautiful young woman in Seattle, Washington, Frances Farmer, was known as a brilliant, outspoken person. She won a newspaper essay contest for a free trip to Russia. Despite warnings from her mother and her friends, she insisted on taking the trip. When she returned, the reporters tried to get her either to praise or condemn the Communist experiment, but she replied, quite honestly, that in such a brief trip she had not seen enough to make a decision. The Communists decided that this meant she was really sympathetic; but did not want to declare herself. Soon afterwards, she was “discovered” by talent scouts, and went to Hollywood. Her radiant beauty proved to be very photogenic, and her movies"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"were an immediate sensation. Because of her famous trip to Russia, she was supposed to be a rabid Communist sympathizer, although she had said or done nothing to support such a theory. The large community of Jewish Communists in Hollywood, who completely controlled the making and distribution of movies, entertained her and raved about her beauty. She was then asked to become a Communist courier. She indignantly refused, being an extremely proud and intelligent White girl who had no interest in Communism. The Hollywood Jews were infuriated and frightened by Frances Farmer’s refusal. They had supposed she was one of them, and had taken her into their confidence. Now she knew the identity of every prominent Communist in Hollywood. At a secret conference, they resolved that she must be disposed of. An “accident” to such a prominent star would be too risky. The Jews decided that “psychoanalysis” was the answer to their dilemma. She would be railroaded to an insane asylum. Any accusations she might make would then be ignored. At the very height of her fame, while everyone was predicting she would win an Academy Award, Frances Farmer was invited to a party at the home of a Jewish producer. She was given a drug during this party. When she drove away, she was soon stopped by a policeman, who claimed she had committed a minor traffic violation. Instead of giving her a ticket, he immediately took her before a judge, although it was late at night. The judge claimed that she was “confused”, and in what could only have been a prearranged plan, he committed her to a mental asylum. Reporters made a complete reversal of their usual practice when a movie star gets into trouble. Instead of headlining Frances Farmer’s predicament, they were told not to write about it! From that day on, her name was rarely mentioned in the press. For six years, Frances Farmer was forced to endure horrors which, even without the drugs and shock treatments which she was given on a daily basis, would have destroyed anyone’s mind. After a few days in a California mental hospital, she was transferred to a state mental hospital, Steilacoom, near Seattle, Washington, ostensibly so that her mother could visit her, but actually to remove her from any contact with anyone in Hollywood. Many years later, a reporter, William Arnold, spent five years tracing the record of Frances Farmer during her years in Steilacoom. He discovered that the orderlies at Steilacoom were mostly convict trusties from McNeill Island Penitentiary on the other side of Puget Sound. He also discovered that Steilacoom was known as “the brothel of Ft. Lewis”. Each evening, drunken soldiers from Ft. Lewis paid the convicts five dollars each and were admitted to certain wards. Here the convicts held down the women chosen by the soldiers, who then took their will. Arnold found inmates who could recall seeing Frances Farmer, easily the most beautiful and desirable of the inmates, being held down by the convicts while she was being gang-raped by the drunken soldiers. Even the most diseased Jewish mind has never claimed that such horrors went on in the German concentration camps as were nightly enacted at Steilacoom. To nullify any complaints from Frances Farmer, the orderlies regularly gave her bad reports, claiming that she was “uncooperative\". Since she was being forcibly ‘held down during these outrages, her cooperation or lack of it does not seem to have presented any problem, but the Jewish doctors were eager to get this diagnosis. The entry of “uncooperative” by the name of any patient in a mental institution means that any and"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"every possible form of drugs, “treatment” and other punishment is necessary. Frances Farmer was given massive doses of electric shock treatment every week. She was forced to endure medieval form of hydrotherapy by which she was thrown into a tub of ice water for periods of six to eight hours. During the agony of these ordeals, she chewed her lips to pieces. After four months of “treatment”, her spirit had been broken. She appeared before the psychiatrists and agreed to “cooperate”. A careful Dr. Nicholson immediately held a press conference to display his latest triumph. In a typical example of Communist “selfticism” and “confession”, Frances Farmer gave her performance. “I was rude and disrespectful,” she told the reporters. “I was very, very sick.” “I think this case demonstrates how successfully antisocial behavior can be modified,” stated Dr. Nicholson. “Three months ago, this woman was mentally unresponsive, and today she is being returned to her family completely cured. This marks a significant victory for the mental hygiene movement in Washington.” Because of her fame as a movie star, Frances Farmer was chosen to be publicly exhibited as an example of the triumph of Freudian theories. The power of the psychiatrists had mushroomed during the war, as psychiatrists were stationed with each unit, just as Communists commissars were placed in each combat unit of the Red Army to identify and arrest any dissenters. As the sole victors of World War II, the Jews rapidly extended the influence of psychotherapy over every aspect of American life. In 1946, Harry Truman signed the National Mental Health Act, which brought “mental health” organizations into almost every community in America. These organizations quickly became local outposts of the State of Israel, seeking out and punishing those Americans who were afflicted with “the running sores of anti-Semitism”, as the Jewish Gestapo group, the Anti-Defamation League, characterized anyone who criticized the subversion of the American government by the State of Israel. No sooner had Dr. Nicholson released Frances Farmer than he received anxious messages. The news that their victim was no longer imprisoned terrified the Hollywood Communists. Dr. Nicholson was instructed to seize her and return her to Steilacoom. Her freedom had lasted less than two weeks. She was now to endure six years of concentrated treatment intended for only one purpose: To destroy her mind so that she would never be able to identify the Hollywood Communists. She was immediately put back on the weekly schedule of shock treatments. This medical boon to mankind came about when two Italians watched the convulsions of a pig after it had been accidentally electrocuted. At first they were merely amused; but they suddenly realized it would be great sport to try this technique on human beings, and electroconvulsive shock treatment was born. The technique called for sending 70 to 130 volts of electricity through the temples of the victim for a tenth of a second. This destroys large numbers of brain cells, and causes years of headaches, permanent loss of memory, and other unpleasant side effects. The benefits of this treatment, as years of experimentation on many thousands of patients has proved beyond all question, are nonexistent. For this reason, electric shock treatments have been outlawed in most European countries for many years. The United States, being firmly in the grip of the Jews, is the only developed nation which still practices this form of barbarism."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Besides enduring the weekly shock treatments, Frances Farmer, who had been consigned back to Steilacoom at a court hearing at which she was not even present, now became the victim of a new operation, the CIA LSD experiments. It was recently revealed that she was the first person chosen to receive the LSD dosages. A Bronx Jew, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, joined the CIA to direct the LSD program, which he personally operated from 1951-1956. Through Teddy Kollek, a Jewish terrorist who was a close friend of Allen Dulles, Gottlieb obtained Dulles’ direct approval of the entire scheme. Kollek, presently mayor of Jerusalem, was at that time in this country illegally to raise money for the Jewish terrorist organization, Haganah. He lived in Manhattan in a rent-free apartment, above the Copacabana night club, provided by its Jewish owners. Kollek was the only non-official person invited to Allen Dulles’ home for parties, and at one of these gatherings, he was introduced to Jim Angleton, later director of Special Operations for the CIA, who became a “Zionist” director of the CIA. Through this alliance, CIA funds were used to pay the entire budget of the Israeli Intelligence Service, while CIA agents all over the world were instructed that Israeli interests came first. They were directed to turn over all information on Arab economic and military operations to the Jews. With this inside information, which the Arabs themselves furnished to the CIA under an agreement set up by Allen Dulles, the Israelis were able to win each confrontation with the Arabs. The CIA also paid King Hussein one million dollars a year for his private spending on blondes, airplanes and fast cars, as his country, Jordan, was penniless. In return, Hussein furnished the CIA complete information on all conferences of the Arab leaders. It was in retaliation for these CIA operations that the Arabs formed the OPEC alliance and raised the price of their oil. Had we not gone out of our way to make enemies of the Arabs, we would still enjoy low prices for oil. Every dollar we spend at the gas pumps is a fine which we pay for helping the Israelis, but your friendly local newspaper is not going to give you this information. Richard Helms now became Gottlieb’s immediate superior in the LSD program. Because this program severely compromised the highest officials of the United States, Helms was later able to have himself appointed Dulles’ successor as Director of the CIA. When he faced dismissal and perjury charges, the personal file of this program enabled him to resign without punishment and to become Ambassador to Iran. On April 3, 1953, Helms sent a memo to Dulles, requesting “the covert use of chemical and biological materials” to develop controls over possible agents, foreign officials and other targets of CIA infiltration. In Nov. 1953, Dr. Gottlieb entertained a group of gentile scientists from the Army Chemical Corps, Special Operations Division, Ft. Detrick, MD. He secretly gave them large doses of LSD in their drinks. One of the scientists, Frank Olson, leaped to his death after taking the dose. Twenty-five years later, his widow, learning of the true circumstances of his death, sued the government and obtained a three- million-dollar settlement. Gottlieb also hired George White, a former narcotics agent, to operate a house of prostitution on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco. CIA officials and other government personages watched the activities through one-way glass and photographed the more unusual scenes. White’s assistant in this operation was one Ike Feldman. This operation"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"proved so successful that a second house was opened in Marin County, Calif., and a third in New York City. When Gottlieb retired in 1973, he had most memoranda concerning his activities destroyed. He had spent more than fifty million dollars without a trace. For more than a year, Frances Farmer received daily doses of LSD, as well as the weekly shock treatments. Despite this cruel regimen, her tormentors were dismayed to find that her brain had not been destroyed. There remained one final horror for her, a treatment which was guaranteed to destroy the brain of anyone. This was prefrontal lobotomy, which in every case had totally destroyed the rational capacity of its victims. A Portuguese doctor, Edgar Muniz, developed this technique for “curing mental illness” in 1935. For this contribution to human well-being, he received the Nobel Prize in 1949. Hundreds of thousands of lobotomies were performed in Europe and the United States. Dr. Walter Freeman, head of the Dept. of Neurology at Georgetown University, became an enthusiastic advocate of prefrontal lobotomy after studying with Muniz. He refined Muniz’ technique by inserting an ice-pick type of instrument under the eyelid into the brain, and severing the nerve from the cortex to the thalamus which directed rational thought. This turned the human victim into a vegetable. Presto! No more anger, no more protest. Instead, there was meek compliance with any order. Deciding it might be more prudent to practice his technique away from Washington, Dr. Freeman went to Spencer State Hospital at Spencer, W. Va. The Jewish doctors at this institution lined up thirty-five women patients, and in a brilliant display of virtuosity, he lobotomized them one after the other. Learning of this triumph, the CIA asked him to go to Steilacoom to lobotomize Frances Farmer. As a cover, he first lobotomized twelve other women patients. Frances Farmer was then brought in, and told that the doctor wished to examine her. Two attendants seized her by the arms, and Dr. Freeman quickly inserted the ice pick into her brain. Two seconds later, Frances Farmer had become a human vegetable, her memory destroyed and her brain barely functioning, she was no longer a threat to the Hollywood Communist conspirators. A few months later, satisfied that her memory was gone, the CIA authorized Dr: Nicholson to release Frances Farmer. Her years of horror were over. On March 23, 1950, she left Steilacoom. She was only thirty-six years old. Despite her ordeal, some traces of her former beauty remained, but when she tried to resume her acting career, she found she could not remember lines or follow directions. She died alone and in poverty in Indianapolis a few years later. Yet, even today, those who ordered her torture and destruction still fear the mention of her name. Not only does the blackout of her films remain in effect, but William Arnold found no one in Hollywood willing to be quoted about her fate. We know the fate of Frank Olson and Frances Farmer only because those dedicated to their memories spent years fighting to uncover their tragic stories. We do not know the fate of many thousands of other victims of the Jewish pseudo-science of psycho-therapy, because no one mourns them or remembers their names. They, too, were done to death by drug overdoses, shock treatments, or the Freeman ice-pick treatment. We must act at once to save thousands of other potential victims from the Jewish terrorists. We must outlaw electric shock treatments as humane nations have done; we must outlaw the practice of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"pseudo-therapy such as psychoanalysis, ice-pick in the brain, and indiscriminate use of LSD and other drugs in the mental institutions. Unless we act quickly, thousands more will die, the victims of Jewish sadism and Freud’s poisonous legacy. This Jew converted the shameless charlatanism of a few eighteenth-century necromancers into a worldwide system for “treating the mentally ill”, solely because of his anti-gentilism and his hatred of Christ. Freud gave the Jews their most powerful weapon against us. We must stop them now. BIBLIOGRAPHY: THE MYTH OF PSYCHOTHERAPY -- by Thomas Szasz. SHAD0WLAND; THE SEARCH FOR FRANCES FARMER -- by William Arnold, McGraw Hill, New York City, N.Y. 1978. “SEX, DRUGS, AND THE CIA”, Saturday Review, Feb. 3, 1979. ***** One single columnist spoke up in her behalf. That was John Rosenfield, at the time of her initial arrest, [quoting:] WHAT HAPPENED TO FRANCES FARMER SHOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL! Just when the movie industry is winning the public’s admiration, Hollywood breaks out in a rash of petty scandals. It is not a tribute to a part of the press that some of these episodes have been played well beyond their merits as news. It was the lesser of sagacity that the industry permitted some of these affairs to get out of hand. The Frances Farmer Incident should never have happened. This unusually gifted actress was no threat against law and order or the public safety. Something that began as merely a traffic reprimand grew into a case of personal violence, a serious charge and a jail sentence. And all because a sensitive high-strung girl was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Miss Farmer, who is no prodigy of emotional stability or sound business management, needed a lawyer one unhappy night last winter. A helping hand might have extradited her immediately from nothing more than a traffic violation. The terrible truth is that she stood alone, and lost. [End quoting] Rosenfield’s was the only note of compassion. The rest of the press coverage followed the lethal lead of Lolly Parsons, who snickered: “Hollywood Cinderella Girl has gone back to the ashes on a liquor-slicked highway”."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"************************************************ 27.) The Latest Report From Japan 6/22/97 From April 23 to May 7, 1997, I lectured again in Japan. On this trip, most of my lectures were given in Tokyo itself, a sprawling metropolis encompassing some thirty million people, about one-third of the population of Japan. I had been invited to join the Japanese people in their annual Observance of Constitution Day on May 3, 1997. I say “observance” rather than celebration, because this event usually involves numerous meetings throughout the nation which complain about the Constitution, which was forced upon them while they were under military occupation. In 1948, during my daily visits to the political prisoner, Ezra Pound, who was being held without trial for life in a federal institution in Washington, D.C. he ventured one of his pungent comments which struck me at the time, and which I have never forgotten. Pound said to me, “In looking at the postwar economies, the ones to watch are Germany and Japan.” “Why, their factories have been bombed to rubble,” I replied. “By the time they finish rebuilding, they will be so deeply in debt, they’ll never be competitive with us.” “You forget one thing,” Pound replied. “They ain’t got no armies.\" “No military costs, eh?” I replied. “That’s it,” said Pound. “Not having military expenditures will give them such a competitive advantage that they’re going to shoot right past us.” How Pound, a political prisoner with no access to economic information, could have foreseen the startling economic boom in Japan and Germany, long before any Americans were buying their automobiles or televisions, has always seemed a marvelous feat to me. Not one of our economists or anyone at our Department of Commerce would have dared to make such a statement in 1948. However, there were minds as clear as Pound’s who did anticipate this and who invested wisely and well in German and Japanese industries. There were those on Wall Street who had access to the thoughts of General William Draper, who served first as economic czar of Germany under the Allied Military Government in 1945, and who later was transferred to General Douglas MacArthur’s staff in Tokyo, where he became the economic czar of Japan. When I point out that there were those on Wall Street who had access to General Draper’s information, I should add that, throughout his distinguished public service as economic czars of the defeated nations, he remained a lifelong partner of the investment house of Dillon, Read & Co. in New York. When you substitute for the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"owner of this firm, Dillon, his original name, Lapowski, you begin to see the pattern emerge. Lapowski, a Texan entrepreneur who had been an understudy of Bernard Baruch, made a fast fortune during the First World War, and came to New York where he purchased the fine old firm of William Read and Co. Lapowski, Read & Co. did not quite have the ring which the new millionaire desired, and he decided that Dillon would be a much more saleable name. Thus the firm of Dillon, Read was born. In 1924, it floated two hundred million dollars to help Germany rearm, with anticipation of a much-to-be-desired Second World War in the future. On previous lectures in Japan, I had recounted the strange odyssey of Dillon, Read and General William Draper. The Japanese were aware that, during the many years of military occupation, these officers lost no opportunity to line their nests, and that an unknown percentage of Japanese industry had wound up in the secret ownership of the occupiers. The names of Rockefeller and Rothschild are as familiar to Japanese as they are to Americans. They are never shy about pronouncing these names as powers in Japan. THE CONSTITUTION OF JAPAN In preparation for this trip to Japan, I had made a study of the Japanese Constitution. I found that its origins were seriously flawed. Because of this study, I was able to draw remarkable parallels between the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Japan. Both were seriously tainted by having been drawn up and adopted in periods of martial law. Black’s Law Dictionary states as a maxim that any legislation adopted under conditions of martial law becomes invalid once the period of martial law ends. This is logical, because legislation passed under conditions of military occupation and armed troops obviously gives the population little chance to voice opposition or to seriously contest such legislation. In seeking to discover other avenues which would be of interest to my Japanese audiences, I also came to a conclusion which can now be stated as Mullins’ Law: “Any nation which has a constitution and which also has a central bank inevitably has its constitution invalidated by the central bank.” I had been studying central banks for some fifty years but I had never before come to such a conclusion. However, this conclusion was inevitable. Sovereignty, as Pound had taught me many years ago, consists of two things, the right to issue money in the name of the realm, and the right to conduct foreign policy. Any power which interferes with or usurps these powers effectively invalidates the operating government of that nation. For this reason, the Founding Fathers carefully included these rights of sovereignty in the Constitution of the United States , that the Congress should have the right to issue and control money, and to direct foreign policy through its power to confirm treaties. USURPATION In the United States, the right to issue money was “delegated”, or rather, sold by Congressmen to a group of private bankers in 1913, who then established the Federal Reserve System. With the money power safely in their hands, the bankers proceeded to"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"takeover the control of foreign policy by setting up numerous groups and foundations, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, which was in reality a mere subsidiary of the Rothschild entity, the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. The British operation assumed the name “Royal” although the monarchy had nothing to do with it; the Federal Reserve System adopted the name “Federal” although the government has never been permitted to own a single share in the stock ownership of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. Japan, of course, had no choice in the adoption of their Constitution. The Japanese Parliament was ordered to adopt it by the occupying military forces. When the Japanese Parliament, or Diet, refused, because of its arbitrary clauses declaring all the personal property of the Emperor to be the property of the state, and by denying Japan the right to have its own army, the generals promptly responded. No less a power than General Douglas MacArthur, the head of the military government, informed the Japanese Parliament that, if they refused to adopt the Constitution, he would indict, try, convict and execute the Emperor of Japan as a war criminal. In the face of this ultimatum, the Parliament adopted the Constitution. I discovered this fact in a small publication issued by the University of Virginia in a study of the Japanese Constitution published some years ago. PUBLIC PROTEST Although many Japanese were not aware of all of these circumstances, they realized that they could not consider themselves an independent nation as long as they were governed by a Constitution adopted under martial law. However, there is a catch to this. The United States still has 47,000 troops stationed in the Japanese islands. Does the presence of 47,000 troops constitute military occupation? Officially, these troops are there as the legacy of the notorious “Cold War”, which I have previously exposed as they greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people for forty-one years, in my article, “The Cold War: The $5 Trillion Hoax”. Here again, this is a typical central bank operation. A central bank must have enormous military expenditures and large standing armies, always with a view to starting a war at some point, in order to create debt, as Ezra Pound had taught me many years before. Therefore, on Constitution Day, not only did I lecture to audiences about the origins of their Constitution, but the former Prime Minister Nakasone and other personages also conducted large protest meetings in which they reiterated their demands for their own Constitution. The press gave very scant coverage to these meetings. THE CIVIL WAR In my book, The Curse of Canaan , I pointed out the taint of our own Constitution, whose Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments had been passed during the military occupation of the eight Southern states. When the legislatures of these states refused to ratify these amendments, they were ordered by the federal government in Washington to do so, under pain of severe retribution. Being under military occupation, these legislators knew that the threats were very real. They did pass these amendments during martial law. Here again, Black’s Law Dictionary affirms that no legislation passed under martial law"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"shall be valid once the period of military occupation is concluded. The federal troops were withdrawn from the Southern states in 1877, after twelve years of military occupation, and then only because Rutherford B. Hayes, himself a Civil War General from Ohio, had campaigned on a pledge to end martial law in the South. It was a hotly contested election, which Hayes barely won. He fulfilled his campaign promise, and the troops were withdrawn from the South. However, it was too late. The corporations had now enthroned themselves, and the American Republic was well on its way to destruction. In 1913, the corporations forced upon the nation the ultimate corporation, the central bank. Today, with our increased understanding of law, we may well admit that, although the troops were withdrawn, the reign of martial law continued unabated in the United States. The establishment of federal courts in the states, and a host of later agencies, meant that the common law was replaced with admiralty law, the law of martial law, in which no human rights were observed. The gold-fringed flag now flies arrogantly in our courts, and the judges sneer at those citizens who still prate of “Constitutional rights”. THE MORAL RESULTS OF A CENTRAL BANK I am the only scholar who has ever thought about the moral results of a central bank. If you examine the moral structure of our nation prior to 1913, and what it is today, you see that terrible things have happened. Children are dying of drug overdoses; one marriage in two ends in divorce; the president is accused of a sexual offense. No economist would admit that these are the inevitable results of passing the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 by Congress. Yet Congressman Charles Augustus Lindbergh Sr. predicted it. For profit, the central bank debases the monetary unit; it creates an “elastic” or rubber dollar. Ezra Pound often spoke to me of the twelve centuries of the Byzantine Empire. Its monetary unit was the gold solidus, which survives today in the saying, “as solid as gold”. To tamper with the stability of the monetary unit is to attack the very fiber of the people. We now see its results all around us. In Japan, too, the patriots who had brought me there again were concerned about these developments. I explained that it was their central bank, and the denial of a genuine Constitution, which were at the root of these problems. Japanese television is usually trivial. I saw nothing of interest during my weeks there. They are intensely interested in cultural pursuits. I was taken to a museum which exhibited hundreds of paintings from the Louvre. The Japanese stood eight and ten deep in front of the pictures. The entire area was jammed. At another museum was an exhibit of hundreds of wall paintings from Pompeii. It too was very crowded. The Japanese are serious people. Yet they are in the same condition as my own people. Their media is controlled; their government officials do not represent them, but alien interests. Their very food and water is contaminated by the same elements which endanger our own supplies. Although they still resist fluoridation of their water, it contains massive amounts of chlorine. I avoided drinking it as much as possible. Many foods are adulterated by massive amounts of monosodium glutamate and other chemicals. If they had a shred of decency, of honor, of patriotism, these are the issues which both American and/ or Japanese politicians should be addressing. They do not, because they are serving as employees of the central bank. Bankers do not like focusing on any issue except"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"increasing their profits. It is this which makes them so dangerous to the nation. If we compare them with the Founding Fathers, who never thought of profit, we can see what has happened. In order to sell us out, they first had to sell themselves out. These are the creatures variously known as the grey men, the hollow men, and the robots. We cannot be human if we allow ourselves to be ruled by nonhumans. This is the message which I brought back from Japan to the American people. ************************************************ 28.) Terrorist Scam: The Great Gold Heist 06/25/97 Studies of the criminal mind prove that a constant determinant in criminal operations is the desire for notoriety, the urge to make “the biggest score in the history of crime”. An accompanying desire is the resolve to set a record which no one else will ever be able to equal, a matter of distinction which will endure in the record books. The extortion plot against the government of Switzerland seems certain to make its mark as the most ambitious scam in the history of crime. International in its scope, it was masterminded by the world’s most resourceful confidence artists, and backed by limitless amounts of cash and propaganda vehicles to carry out a program unequalled not only for its audacity but also for the brilliance of its planning. The caper was conceived by billionaire Edgar Bronfman, while watching a rerun of Charlie Chaplin’s film, The Gold Rush. He turned to an aide at the end of the film, and said, “This is it. We’re going to go for the gold.” The gold which he intended to seize was Swiss gold, which reputedly had once been Nazi gold, and prior to World War II supposedly had been “Jewish” gold, that is gold held by Jewish people. A hasty calculation convinced the plotters that, at today’s prices, this “Jewish” gold today could be valued at $71 billion, a figure arrived at by “computing” the alleged value of Jewish bank accounts in Switzerland at the outset of World War Il. However, Bronfman’s aides soon returned with the discouraging report that the record of the claimed amounts was a much more modest amount, $4 million. Even more dismaying was the revelation that the Truman Administration had promptly appointed a deputy negotiator to conclude a treaty with Switzerland in 1946 by which the government of Switzerland agreed to pay the sum of $4 million ($55 millions in today’s currency) as a final quit-claim full settlement of all claims against Switzerland for alleged “Nazi” gold. The U.S. negotiator was not someone who could be called insensitive to the Jewish aspects of this dispute. He was Seymour J. Rubin, Jewish, who is now an 83-year-old retired international trade specialist living quietly in Washington. TERRORISTS IN ACTION"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The “experts” of the World Jewish Congress refused to be deterred by the disheartening news of the 1946 settlement of these claims in full. They decided to ignore the 1946 treaty with Switzerland, and to call for the reopening of the claims on more “updated” research. In fact, no research could be carried out. Not only had the alleged accounts in Swiss banks been carried as “numbered” bank accounts, by numbers rather than by names, but the accounts had never been segregated as “Jewish” accounts, “Nazi” accounts, or by other categories. These accounts had been set up in Switzerland solely because of the shrouding of these holdings in the deepest secrecy. To “reopen” the settlement by attempting to trace accounts which went back fifty or sixty years, and which had been established to maintain secrecy, as the Swiss now maintained, would be impossible. Although most conspirators would have quietly buried their plans after these revelations, the World Jewish Congress operators received the news as a gauntlet thrown down to them, a challenge which they welcomed. In fact, the Zionists have on numerous occasions achieved impressive gains by making seemingly impossible demands. First of all, by advancing demands which cannot be met, they issue a challenge to both their supporters and their opponents to choose sides, and to go on record either with their support or their opposition. It does not matter how unreasonable the demands are; if they are completely unreasonable, this means that their supporters agree to uphold them even in the most preposterous claims. As for the opponents, their names also go on the record, and can be disposed of later, by the most ruthless means. “Never forgive; never forget”, as their motto proudly proclaims. The Swiss government’s initial response to the demands from the World Jewish Congress were firm, but unyielding. However, they were amazed, and then terrified, by the counter- tactics which engulfed them from the conspirators. A worldwide media assault was launched which denounced the Swiss, not only for “stealing” Jewish gold, but also for alleged cooperation with the Nazi government throughout World War II. However, the Swiss government’s record during the Second World War showed that its famed neutrality was maintained, not only by the German government, but by the Allied governments as well. It suited the warring nations that a Swiss island of neutrality be observed in order to carry on negotiations and to provide the ideal meeting ground for espionage agents of all the powers. Britain’s famed Secret Intelligence Service had its James Bonds roaming freely throughout Switzerland during the war. The U.S. government set up Allen Dulles of the Office of Strategic Services with a full-time espionage office in Switzerland from 1943 to 1945. From this redoubt, he directed a network of American agents in Germany, many of whom established direct contacts with Nazi officials. After the war, Dulles was rewarded by being named the head of the new Central Intelligence Agency. ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE STORY In its new assault against Switzerland, the World Jewish Congress was ably abetted by Zionist control of media outlets: the Meyer family at the Washington Post ; the Sulzbergers at the New York Times ; the $10 billion Newhouse newspaper empire which controlled many dailies throughout the United States, and their Canadian and English associates in the Hollinger and Thomson chains, which owned hundreds of daily newspapers in the United"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"States. Always eager to oblige, the cover of Time magazine featured a lurid gold swastika as its intellectual contribution to the battle, which was intended to dramatize not only the “missing” Jewish gold, but also the guilt of Switzerland as a Nazi collaborator. The World Jewish Congress, after the shock of the initial $71 billion claim against Switzerland had abated, scaled its demands quickly down to a mere $7 billion. Rumors were put forth that this demand would most likely be finalized at S500 million; Bronfman intimated that he would refuse to go lower than this “modest” figure. This would still be a very handsome settlement for claims amounting to S4 million, which had been paid in full in a final settlement negotiated by the United States government in 1946. Swiss government officials went into shock as the great gold heist proceeded according to schedule. After denouncing the plot as “extortion” and intimidation, the Swiss were met by Bronfman’s hard line. He announced that there would be a worldwide boycott of Swiss banks in the financial markets, which could very well result in the “disestablishment” of Switzerland as a financial power. Panicked by this prospect, the Swiss officials suddenly became propitiatory. They announced various plans for “investigating” the claims, promised to set up “humanitarian” funds, and made other amazing concessions, amazing in view of the fact that a group of determined attackers had launched their conspiracy without any evidence that anybody in Switzerland owed them anything. CHUTZPAH The effrontery of these demands was considered not at all extraordinary by the claimants because of their long history of such operations. The great gold heist was but the latest chapter in a long list of excessive demands levied against governments throughout the world. Few people outside of the conspiracy had any inkling that this was a typical Talmudic operation, designed to further a plan of worldwide conquest and expropriation, whose long sought goal was to seize all the wealth of the world. By “all”, the Talmudists meant exactly that; there would be no exceptions. As the Jewish Chronicle stated in its issue of March 26, 1937: “It is by means of Freemasonry that the Jew, who is a Jew by birth and race, will rule the Universe, with the Crown (Rether) on his head, and the Kingdom (Malkutuh) of the world at his feet.” Non-Jewish members of the Masonic lodges seem to ignore the fact that the motto of Freemasonry is to return all the wealth of the world to King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. This is why the Rothschilds financed the Jewish “return” to Palestine during the nineteenth century, and why they are considered the patron saints of the State of Israel today. Jacob Rothschild with a single gift financed the building of the entire Knesset or Parliament building. Rothschild Avenue sweeps past it; the Rothschild Museum is nearby. In reality, the State of Israel is little more than a private colony of the house of Rothschild, financed by many billions of dollars extorted from the United States taxpayers each year. Anyone who questions this extortion is denounced as an “antisemite”, and soon finds it impossible to obtain employment anywhere in the United States. As David Ben-Gurion, one of the founders of the State of Israel, boasted in Look Magazine ,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Feb. 16, 1962, “The United Nations will build a Shrine of the Prophets to serve the federated union of all the continents; this will be the site of the Supreme Court of Mankind, to settle all controversies among the federated continents.” Seen in this context, the great gold heist is but a logical plan in the overall program to return all the wealth of the world to King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. Dominated by Masons, the courts in the United States and European nations are already a ‘Supreme Court” of the Masonic Order, existing solely to promote the transfer of wealth to the conspirators. Remember the propaganda that Supreme Court decisions are “the law of the land”. Previously, the Constitution of the United States of America was the law of the land. No more. All of its provisions are subject to review and “new interpretations” by the Masons on our Supreme Court, which is but the forerunner of the real Supreme Court which, Ben Gurion informs us, is to be set up at the real seat of power, in Jerusalem. WACKOS Anyone who sounds the alarm at this program, which seems well on its way to completion by the year 2000, its announced time table, is denounced in the media and by government officials as a “wacko”, a paranoid person who should be institutionalized at once, before he becomes a greater threat to society. Once safely in the hands of Zionist psychiatrists, the offender can be given drugs and electric shock treatment, and his brain lobotomized, the lobes governing decisionmaking and memory removed by radical surgery, so that he will no longer interfere with the program. Since he is now permanently insane, no one will pay any attention to him. Those who join in the World Jewish Congress’ mad race for power are hailed as great statesmen. At the present time, our greatest statesman is Senator Al D’ Amato of New York. But, we might well observe, D’Amato is not even Jewish. He is not Jewish, but he is totally dependent on Jewish campaign funds for his upcoming re-election bid. In return for his spearheading the great gold heist from Switzerland through his office in Washington, D’Amato stands to reap millions in Jewish contributions for his re-election. According to R.J. Moravek, D’Amato agreed to use his Washington post as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee to throw the entire weight of the United States government behind the extortion plot against Switzerland. The Clinton White House has cooperated in the extortion plot by issuing a 200-page “Eizenstat Report” under the official imprimatur of the United States government, which claims that the Swiss confiscated the Jewish gold. Eizenstat was formerly secretary for Jewish affairs in the Carter White House. He has always been a loyal Zionist wheelhorse in Washington. The “Eizenstat Report” ignores the facts, which are easily verifiable. In 1939, more than $250 million in Jewish accounts in Switzerland was transferred to accounts in the United States. In April 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt “froze” these funds, claiming that they were really German accounts. After World War II, a mere $500,000 was returned by the United States government to Jews claiming these accounts. The rest of the $250 million was spent by the Roosevelt Administration. SWISS RESISTANCE"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Today, Swiss citizens have been infuriated by the abject acceptance of the World Jewish Congress demands by Swiss officials. The Swiss political party, ASIN, held a huge rally in Bern headed by Christopher Blocher. Another Swiss patriot, Arnold Roller, declared, “Never in this century has Swiss independence and neutrality been so threatened. The Central Bank and the federal government are too weak to fight off this blackmail.” There is now a strong “anti-government” movement throughout Switzerland to replace its craven officials with genuine Swiss patriots. Americans can take heart from the fact that, in this worldwide conspiracy, there are still pockets of resistance. Meanwhile, the media proclaims in the United States that to be “anti-government” means that you are a Timothy McVeigh seeking to blow up government buildings. The answer to this falsehood is that we are loyal Americans trying to fight off subversion of our government by arrogant outsiders. Bronfman has boasted that he brought the mighty DuPont family to their knees. Today, he holds the controlling interest in the DuPont factories. In the Jewish community, there is growing concern that Bronfman’s drive to collect billions from the Swiss has little to do with Jewish affairs and much to do with his own personal ambitions.On April 14, 1997, the Central Rabbinical Court of the United States received a legal complaint from the World Council of Orthodox Jewish Communities charging Bronfman with misrepresentation and mismanagement in his drive to collect funds for “survivors”. The complaint states that “survivors will be fortunate to receive any amount from the billions extorted by the World Jewish Congress.” THE RUBIN REPORT Another blow to the Bronfman conspiracy appeared in a feature story in the Sunday New York Times , May 25, 1997, by Francis X. Clines. The headline is “Wartime Envoy on Nazi Gold Bristles at Hindsight”. It is an extensive interview with Seymour J. Rubin, who finalized the original treaty with the Swiss government in 1946 which settled claims of the “Nazi gold”. Mr. Rubin said of the treaty’s enactment, “There never was any great controversy at all.” He continues, “The accusation now that we pooped out in a basic blunder on the part of Mr. Truman seems to me pandering to Al D’Amato and maybe the Jewish organizations as well. Basically, I think Mr. Eizentstat took a look at what the public pressures are and then decided that one of the things he could do was fault the U.S. delegation back in 1946.\" As a government official still working at the age of 83, Mr. Rubin noted that he had been working in Washington since 1939. He might have raised the question as to why Stuart Eizenstat, now an Under Secretary of Commerce under President Clinton, was essentially interfering in what would normally be a State Department operation. Of course he would not be criticized by Clinton’s Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who, after being appointed as the first woman to hold this prestigious position, suddenly discovered that she was Jewish. For five years previously, numerous published stories about her background had pointed out that she was Jewish. She claimed that she never read them. Certainly she would throw no obstacles in the path of a fellow-Jew, Stu Eizenstat, who was using his"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"official U.S. government office to carry on a conspiracy for the World Jewish Congress. THE BRONFMAN ARCHIVES And what of the head of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, the mastermind of the assault on the Swiss government? The great gold heist is a fitting climax to the history of the Bronfman family. The Bronfman family history is illuminated by an important new book, The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Mobster , by Albert Fried. This work was dramatized on the Arts and Entertainment television network on May 28, 1997. Fried points out that Jews were persuaded to go into the illicit liquor business by a well-known entrepreneur in New York, Arnold Rothstein. His youthful proteges included such rising Jewish stars as Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and Gurrah Shapiro. However, Rothstein strayed from his own recommendations when he realized that there was much more money in dope. In The World Order , I state on p. 170: “Although Rothstein was widely known as a gambler, this was a cover for his rise to eminence as Mr. Big of the U.S. drug trade. After he was shot in 1928, Louis Lepke, head of Murder Inc., confiscated over $5 million worth of heroin from Rothstein’s hotel room.” When Prohibition became the law of the land in the United States, Rothstein’s proteges needed a source outside of the United States to supply their goods. They found it in the Bronfman family of Canada, which became known as the Canadian end of the notorious “Reinfeld Syndicate”, which controlled the flow of illicit booze into the United States. Sammy Bronfman had begun his career as a hotel operator in Canada. His Frontier Hotel was little more than a house of prostitution. In going over his books, he found that he was making more money from the drinks served to his customers than he was collecting from his prostitutes. He resolved to go into the liquor business, a decision which ultimately made his family one of the five richest in the world. Detroit became the principal port of entry [of booze] into the United States. Fried says that at the peak of the profession, fifty thousand people were engaged in the bootlegging business in Detroit, almost as many as were manufacturing cars and trucks. A native Detroiter, Moe Dalitz, had become a lifelong criminal at the age of 14, organizing the Purple Gang to burn out competitors of his father’s dry cleaning business. After moving the bootlegging operations to Cleveland, he ran the Cleveland Syndicate for years. He left only after realizing that Bugsy Siegel had discovered a gold mine in Las Vegas. He had Siegel assassinated, and his henchman, Gus Greenbaum, walked into the Flamingo Hotel and snarled, “We’re taking over.” Moe Dalitz reigned as the boss of Las Vegas for forty years. When he died, the New York Times hailed him as a “great philanthropist”, citing his many contributions to Jewish organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith. MURDER, INC . Faced with the Talmudic demands from the group which intended [and intends] to seize the wealth of the entire world, the Swiss found themselves almost helpless. Having been legitimate businessmen for centuries, they had no experiences which would enable them to deal with Murder Inc. They faced not only the power of the Bronfman bootleg billions,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"now legitimized as the great Seagram Liquor corporation, but also the power of the World Jewish Congress and the principal media outlets of the world, which were its captive and wholly-owned propagandists. Condemned as “Nazi collaborators” by the international propagandists, the Swiss have no means of recourse. With the full power of the entire United States government employed to legitimize the false claims of the World Jewish Congress, the Swiss seem unwilling even to cite the definitive settlement of 1946, which, according to worldwide contract law, was a final settlement of all such claims and agreed to by all the contracting parties. Now the United States portrays itself to the world as a foolish prostitute who claims, “I didn’t get enough money for my morals when I sold myself to the World Jewish Congress.” We can only hope that the Swiss people will rise up to deny this extortion, and will sweep out its craven officials, who are all too eager to comply with the most outrageous demands of the Talmudists. It is a well known fact in the criminal world that when you pay off a blackmailer, it is only the first installment. How much will the Swiss be forced to pay before they acknowledge the nature of their enemy? ************************************************ 29.) Historic First Amendment Action: Legal Update From Eustace Mullins 08/05/97 Dear Rick, Enclosed is my latest filing, Memorandum of Points and Authorities in the Nesher case. I call it Nesher because the Berkshire Eagle is Lelyveld’s paper and Nesher is the Hebrew word for eagle. There are some very important legal points in here which might make it worthwhile to print the entire Memorandum. I was introduced to Frederic Jesup Stimson’s great work The Law Of The Federal And State Constitutions Of The United States in 1980 by a friend in Washington. Stimson says “The cardinal principle is that no fact can be found without the intervention of the petit jury.” This does away with the entire Discovery mechanism, which is Talmudic. Stimson says, “The common law sounds only in damages.” This means that the statutory principles invoked against a litigant are invalid. He states, “Bearing in mind firmly the principle that the English law sounds only in damages, and that the notion of ordering or even forbidding, any act (except under a criminal statute) is utterly foreign to its system.” Yet the defendant ORDERS me to provide a list of all my residences for the last 46 years, which I am unable to provide. It will be interesting to see where this goes. Their lawyers again denounced all my pleadings as “rambling and nonsensical”. Stimson is the finest scholar in our legal history, yet my quotes from him are “rambling and nonsensical”!"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Will keep you informed, /s/ Eustace Mullins ***** UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS WESTERN SECTION CIVIL ACTION No.96CV-30221 -FHF EUSTACE C. MULLINS PLAINTIFF V. THE BERKSHIRE EAGLE DEFENDANT PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO EXPUNGE DEFENDANT’S DISCOVERY AND PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE FROM THE RECORD MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES Plaintiff, Eustace C. Mullins, appearing for himself as the movant, a private citizen, a citizen in party, who has firsthand knowledge of the facts, herewith submits to the Court the Memorandum of Points and Authorities to support this Motion, as follows: 1. This is an action brought alleging violations of the First Amendment rights of Plaintiff, denial of freedom of speech, and denial of the right to peaceably assemble, protected by the language of the First Amendment (1791) “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” 2. This is a historic First Amendment action, citing grievous violations of these rights. The Court is sworn to uphold the Constitution , and has the responsibility to fully protect Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights. Freedom of speech is the citizen’s exercise of political power; without it, he is emasculated and has no political being in this Republic. The Nation in its issue of July 21, 1997, quotes Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, “freedom of speech means freedom for the speech we hate\"; Holmes called for a \"free trade in ideas” and declared that “the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the marketplace”. The Nation cites two Supreme Court decisions upholding this right, the recent striking down of the Communications Decency Act in Reno v. A.C.L.U., and the Supreme Court’s 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, stating “The concept that the government may restrict the speech of some elements in our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment ”."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"3. In this same issue, “Speech and Power” of The Nation , Ronald L. Collins and David M. Shover, law professors at Seattle University write, urging that we “liberate the public discourse of the First Amendment from lawiers and law professors and open it up to other perspectives.” Floyd Abrams, who lectures on the First Amendment at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, states, “The oldest reality about the First Amendment is this: Hardly anyone really believes that we should protect the speech of those from whom we differ.” This was the attitude of Defendant in its assault on Plaintiff, and it is the attitude of Defendant throughout its Discovery demands made upon Plaintiff. 4. Throughout its Discovery, defendant perpetrates a fraud and a hoax upon the Court by largely ignoring the First Amendment violations and attempting to focus this action on racial issues, which it deliberately created and interjected in order to incite racial hatred throughout the Berkshire area. An even greater hoax was its crude attempt to convince Jewish residents of the area that they were in dire peril from Plaintiff despite Plaintiff’s prior advertisements that he intended to lecture only on the Federal Reserve System, with no mention of race, gender, or national origin. Plaintiff hopes to allay these unwarranted fears and reassure the alarmed Jewish residents of the area by citing Jacob Heilbrunn, in his article, Christian Rights, in the July 7, 1997 issue of the New Republic . Heilbrunn commends Michael Horowitz, whom he defines as “a Jewish neoconservative” and cites Horowitz’ artitle in the Wall Street Journal , July 5, 1995, “For American Jews who owe our very lives to the open door of ‘the’blessed land’, silence should not be an option in the face of persecutions eerily parallel to those committed by Adolf Hitler.” Horowitz was urging people to protest the present persecutions of Christians in China, Africa, and the Middle East. 5. Defendant’s Discovery reveals a determination to force Plaintiff out of this action by heaping upon him irrelevant and unanswerable demands, such as all of Plaintiffs places of residence since 1951, forty-six years during which Plaintiff traveled and researched extensively in many cities in temporary housing of a few days at a time, and of which he maintained no records, due to not having an office, any employees, or places in which to house such records. By these actions, defendant hopes to bring about what one famous attorney calls “Death by Discovery”, the total destruction of an aged litigant in poor health by forcing him out of the action out of law, in effect, making him an “outlaw”, which was the original meaning of this term. This violates Cap 39 Magna Carta (1215), “No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or diseased, or outlawed, or exiled, or anyway destroyed.” This legal principle survives in our Constitution , as noted by Frederic Jesup Stimson, “ THE LAW OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ”, p. 11, “The Right to Law. The law required by this general right, furthermore, must be the Common Law of the English people. That is to say, in origin, the body of their free customs and usages, made by themselves; not by a king, and also, in earliest days, enforced by themselves; and furthermore, it must be the Cornmon Law, not the Roman or Civil law, nor the Canon or Church law, nor any supposed Administrative law, or orders or decrees of the king, or king in Council. In early English trials, therefore, what was tried was rarely whether the man did the deed (it was usually admitted or known), but whether he was right in doing it; that is to say, was he in his law. Was he acting upon a state of facts"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"whereon the unwritten law gave the right of reparation or vengeance into his own hands? If not, he was out of law, outlaw; that is, he had lost his right to law as against anyone molesting him in person or property.” Stimson points out on p. 24, “The common law sounds in damages .. Thus, the earliest codes or statutes merely fix a scale of penalties. The notion of compelling a free man to do something or to abstain from doing something was foreign to Anglo-Saxon ideas of liberty. Like the doctrine of free will carried to its extreme, a freeman was lord of his own acts; only liable for the consequences of the same, to the person injured; later, only to the Crown if a criminal act, and to the individual injured if a private wrong. Even when the judgment of the court was against him, the defendant was never compelled to do a thing, or even, in ordinary cases, to make restitution, as in the Oriental systern of rendering justice. This principle must never be lost sight of, for it explains many things noted in local history.” Stimson continues, “Bearing in mind firmly the principle that the English law sounds only in damages, and that the notion of ordering or even forbidding any act (except under a criminal statute) is utterly foreign to its system; and the cardinal principle that no fact can be found without the intervention of the petit jury: we shall be able to understand both the historical reason and the present meaning of the objections of the American people to the injunctive powers of chancery and ex parte sentences for contempt made by the judge who issued the injunction and upon the facts as found by him showing the infringement of the same.” Although Stimson here is commenting upon the chancery procedure, the defendant’s Discovery itself becomes a chancery procedure or, more aptly, a Star Chamber procedure, with its insistence that Plaintiff furnish under oath all details of his past fifty years of research and addresses while doing this work, while ignoring the facts of September 26, 1996, when Defendant launched its frenzied and libelous assault against Plaintiff to prevent him from speaking or having an assembly in the Berkshire area. On p. 59, Stimson writes that “Chancery jurisdiction rested originally on the royal powers as wielded by the King through his Chancellor (in civil matters) or Justiciar (in criminal). These high officials were usually clerics, hence familiar with canon or Roman law rather than the Anglo--Saxon common law, which they probably despised. The common law knew only one remedial process: punishment for doing wrong; it could not, as a priest might do, order a litigant to do right .. From the Chancellor grew the court of chancery and all our courts of equity. Mitigating or supplementing the somewhat clumsy and uncompromising common law was well and good; but the Chancellor also shared in this extraordinary, un-English, Norman, and tyrannical power of ordering a free citizen to do something he did not wish to do .. For what we may call the Continental notion, derived from the Roman, is that all law rests on the order of a sovereign to his subject, coupled with a threat of punishment if he does not obey; to make a man do something or not do something. This is still more the Oriental notion .. But this notion had absolutely no place in the common law of England. An Englishman was a free man, responsible for his acts: he could be punished for them by the state, or made to pay damages for them by the individual; but he could not be ordered to do anything. In the earliest days of all, when in Saxon tribes each man executed his own"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"law, the “courts”, i.e. the assembly of his neighbors, only tried the question of whether he was in his right in so doing, and if not he paid a regular fine, at first fixed by custom, later and most elaborately, by the earliest written laws we have preserved in England.” Plaintiff further cites Magna Carta (12 15) Cap 35, “The writ called Praecipe shall not in future be issued so as to cause a freeman to lose his court.” 6. Defendant’s Discovery pretends that it seeks to ascertain “facts” after having steadfastly refused to ascertain any of these facts by interviewing Plaintiff, despite Plaintiff’s repeated efforts to have defendant interview him after the libelous attack of September 26, 1996, was published in the Berkshire Eagle . The real effort here is to deny Plaintiff a trial of this action, to obstruct justice, and to prevent a jury from hearing any of the facts in this case. The ancient legal maxim is that “Discovery simply means an attempt to discover the best way to get rid of an opponent.” It is also the legal profession’s tried-and-true technique to get rid of a citizen who attempts to represent himself in a legal action. 7. Despite Defendant’s persistent attempts to obscure and ignore the issues of this action, namely, denial of freedom of speech, denial of the right to peaceably assemble, and criminal libel committed by the defendant against Plaintiff, these issues remain before the Court and must be addressed. This is one of the two most important civil rights actions ever to be argued in a Massachusetts court. It deals with the most heinous hate crime committed in the State of Massachusetts in 1996, and the media has resolutely refused to report it. 8. Art. 4 Set 2 Constitution of the United States . “The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.” 16 Corpus Juris Secundum 199: “The basic principle of our constitutional system is that all political power is inherent in the people. A constitutional right is quoted from any attack or interference by the legislature, or any other governmental agency of the state.” Sec. 205, “right of personal security. The courts must ever be able to protect personal rights guaranteed by state or federal constitutions. Constitutional rights cannot be made dependent on the favor of the court. Neither may they be abridged or suspended even for a single moment; it is a constitutional function of the American Judiciary to protect life and liberty against high- handed or capricious official invasions operating under legal forms.” Eustace C.

New Filing In Historical Civil Rights Case: Legal Update From Eustace Mullins 08/21/97 Dear Rick: I am making terrific headway in my lawsuit by breaking new ground. I am challenging the legal profession’s greatest racket, “discovery”, which forces a litigant to obey the commands of the opponent. The Eagle's lawyers claim they are not satisfied with my answers to their interminable and irrelevant demands for more and more discovery. They file a Motion to Compel Answers, which gives me the opportunity to challenge discovery on Constitutional grounds: violation of the 4th Amendment, right to be secure in your home, violation of the 5th Amendment, you cannot be compelled to testify against yourself, and 7th Amendment, right to trial by jury, violated because the opponent sets himself up as judge and jury in the discovery process. For the first time, I challenged the lawyers to cite the article of the Constitution which authorizes them to request discovery and which authorizes them to demand my tax returns so they can turn them over the ADL. I have traced “discovery” back to Talmudic law, to the torture of a Christian, which reached its apogee when the Jew Torequenada posed as a Catholic official in medieval Spain, and tortured wealthy Christians until they admitted to “heresy; their only heresy was possessing property which the Jew coveted. He then burned them at the stake and seized their property. This made the Jews the wealthiest group in Spain, just as they are now the wealthiest group in the United States by torturing Christians and seizing their property under the guise of judicial or other government authority. In my letter to the Eagle’s lawyer, I confront him with the fact that the writings which he demands discovery on have all come from the ADL, which is a Mafia-connected group working as an unregistered agent in the United States for a foreign power, the State of Israel. I wonder how he is going to handle that? All the best, /s/ Eustace ***** A historic legal request filed at U.S. District Court in Springfield, Massachusetts today by author Eustace C. Mullins is “Plaintiffs Motion to Prohibit Discovery”. Mullins civil rights action against the Berkshire Eagle , a newspaper serving the famous Berkshire area, charges denial of freedom of speech, denial of the right to peaceable assembly, and criminal libel. It has been in litigation for a year."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Mullins, 74, of 126 Madison Place, Staunton, VA is the author of many books, including the only history of the Federal Reserve System, and the only authorized biography of his mentor, the poet Ezra Pound. He had previously challenged the Eagle’s voluminous “discover” demands as “overly broad, failing to cite requested documents by date and title, and beyond the scope of the complaint.” He now moves further, in asking the court to prohibit discovery in one of the most historic civil rights cases ever heard in the United States. Discovery has long been known as the “cash cow” of the legal profession, because of the enormous income which it generates for the lawyers. Attorneys call it “Death by Discovery”. One attorney says, “Discovery simply means an attempt to discover the best way to get rid of the opponent.” Mullins’ latest challenge to the legal monopoly’s discovery process will be pursued by the National Commission for Judicial Reform, a citizen’s activity group. He states that discovery violates the 4th , 5th and 7th Amendments to the Constitution , including the 4th Amendment’s guarantee that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated .” He points out the discovery violates the 5th Amendment’s guarantee that a person shall not be compelled to testify against himself, as well as the 7th Amendment , which guarantees the right of trial by jury. Mullins points out that “pretrial discovery” actually usurps and precludes a jury trial, becoming a trial in itself, a Star Chamber procedure in which a litigant is subjected to the orders, directions and commands of the opponent. Two recent headlined cases, the Texaco discrimination case, a $176 million award, and the tobacco case, a $368.5 billion award were won because of unlimited discovery by the complainants, in which all private records of the companies were turned over to them. Reopening the discovery could result in the tobacco companies refusing to pay the award. Mullins cites America’s preeminent legal scholar, Frederic Jesup Stimson, who points out in his definitive work “ The Law of The Federal and State Constitutions ”, that “no fact can be found without the intervention of the petit jury.” Stimson also reminds us that legal maneuvers such as discovery were “an extraordinary, un-English, Norman and tyrannical power of ordering a free citizen to do something he did not wish to do, which he calls an Oriental or Roman despotic power, which violates the ancient Anglo-Saxon common law. ************************************************ 31.) More Clues About the Murder of Princess Diana 09/12/97 (From Middle Eastern sources)"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"For a few terrible moments, it seemed that the fate of Israel hung in the balance. Word had just been flashed from Paris to Tel Aviv that Dodi Fayed had presented Princess Diana with a $200,000 diamond engagement ring. The announcement of their formal engagement was imminent. Why was this of such portent to the State of Israel? Her son, William, was now the heir apparent to the throne. His father, Prince Charles, was despised by the British public. Conversely, they adored Princess Diana. William would be King, with an Arab stepfather. Only a Zionist could understand that, for the first time in a century, they would not have a friend at court. For almost a hundred years, the Rothschilds had made sure to maintain their standing in the palace at Windsor. Queen Victoria had been dominated by the Rothschild agent, Prime Minister D’Israeli, his name, of course, meaning, of Israel. Her son, King Edward VII, had always been surrounded by Rothschilds and other Jewish bankers, who lavished millions of dollars on him to satisfy his gargantuan appetite for food, entertainment, and beautiful mistresses, while the Rothschilds continued their plans for the colonization of Palestine. This tradition continued unabated throughout the twentieth century. Now, suddenly, it seemed that the unthinkable was about to happen. The Zionists would not have a friend at court. William’s reign would be dominated, not by Zionists, but by an Arab and his wife, neither of whom had any reason to feel kindly towards the State of Israel. The Zionists leaders, sensing the inevitable, had been laying plans for the elimination of Princess Diana. Israeli Intelligence, the dread Mossad agency, had already devised several plans, including a car bomb, an assassin with a pistol, poison, and other tried-and-true methods of political assassination. When Tel Aviv was informed that an engagement announcement was imminent, immediate action was required. However, final approval for the “action” had to come from Zionist leader Netyanahu. He could not be reached. The Mossad officer in charge knew his duty; he grunted the words, “Go ahead.” Because the existing plans for Princess Diana’s murder could not be employed on such short notice, the agents on duty in Paris were told, use any method; it must be done NOW! Fayed had a number of regular chauffeurs; one of them, Henri Paul, was off duty, and had been spotted drinking in the hotel. A Mossad agent hurried to Fayed’s car, and informed the driver that he had been relieved for the night. Another agent went into the bar, signalled a bartender to give Henri Paul a potion, and then informed Paul that he had been called back to duty. Knowing the whims of his employer, Paul made no protest. No doubt he felt strange as he made his way out to the car. The paparazzi were waiting; the scenario for an automobile accident was ready. Dodi Fayed and the Princess paid no attention to the fact that the driver had been changed. They knew Paul was a reliable driver, Billionaires do not bother themselves with schedules of their servants, or who is to drive and who is off duty. Well-paid minions take care of all such details. Paul got behind the wheel, and they roared away, with the paparazzi in full pursuit. The laughing Fayed, who enjoyed his media celebrity since he had begun dating Diana, yelled at him, “Give it to ‘em, Henri.” Henri obligingly floor-boarded the big, armor-plated Mercedes. While they were in the tunnel, the driver suddenly felt the full strength of the potion, and slumped forward. As he blacked out, his foot pressed all the way on the accelerator. The mighty engine surged forward until it encountered an immovable"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"object; the car was crushed. Fayed died almost immediately; Diana struggled for breath as the life drained out of her. THE ISRAELI IMPERATIVE Any Israeli would see this assassination as both logical and perhaps even moral. You either wanted the State of Israel to survive, or you did not. Fayed’s father, Mohammed Al Fayed, the billionaire owner of the historic Harrod’s Department Store in London and many other businesses, would not agree, but, in the shock of losing his son and heir, it is doubtful that he would see any political implications in what seemed to be an unfortunate accident. In history, there are not that many accidents. In any case, Zionists had perceived a threat, and had acted promptly to eliminate it. The assassination of Princess Diana did not mean that the security of Israel was now assured. It only meant that one danger had been taken care of. The State of Israel continues to be the loose cannon on the world stage, its very aimlessness a threat not only to such hapless victims as Princess Diana, but to nations as well. The mass outpouring of grief at the death of Princess Diana, not only in England but throughout the world, indicates that there is a popular intuition at work, a silent recognition that she had been murdered by sinister forces. How else can we explain such depth of feeling for one who, personable and charismatic though she was, could hardly be thought to have touched the pulse of the entire world? This grief acknowledges the fact that she has been martyred by the forces of evil. Now that she has been taken from us, we must face the question; should we wait passively for the next victim of the Zionist terrorists to be murdered before our eyes, or should we begin to take steps to protect not only them, but ourselves as well, from the crazed Zionist murderers? ************************************************ 32.) Mossad Attack: Murder Incorporated; Zionist Terrorists Exposed 10/27/97 Dear Rick, Enclosed is my latest story, “MURDER INC.“, the story of the Hamas assassination in Jordan; it has been kept off the Front Pages by the stock market doo-doo, perhaps not accidentally. At any rate it is the last we shall ever hear of it, so once again it is up to CONTACT to keep the story before the public. All the best, /s/ Eustace C. Mullins"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" ***** On September 25, 1997, the reality of the State of Israel was exposed to the world. On that day, in downtown Amman, capital of the Middle Eastern nation of Jordan, two professional killers stalked their prey, an Arab official named Khaled Meshal, who was on his way to his office. The Washington Post , Oct. 9, 1997 described the assassination plot in Meshal’s own words. One of two Mossad killers, posing as Canadian tourists, “fell in behind Meshal as he left his car and extended an arm to the Hamas leader’s left ear. From a lead-colored instrument wrapped in tape came a loud, popping sound, Meshal said, and a shivery sensation raced down his spine like an electric shock. The two agents were captured after a car chase by Meshal’s bodyguards. Meshal was taken violently ill and hovered near death until an antidote to the poison was delivered to him after King Hussein’s angry demand.” Although not always fatal, the poison administered to Meshal in the attempted murder was deliberately chosen as a slow-acting poison prolongs hours of intense agony for the victim, characterized by uncontrollable vomiting and finally respiratory arrest. It is one of eighty- two poisons developed by Yagoda, Jewish chief of the KGB under Stalin, during years of intense research. TERRORISM UNMASKED The Meshal atrocity reveals to the American people that the State of Israel, to which our taxpayers contribute three billion in cash each year, plus “military” and other commitments amounting to ten billion a year, exists today only because of its sordid history of terrorism. Zionist terrorists in groups such as the Haganah and the Irgun Svai Leumi, relentlessly carried on a campaign of political assassinations in order to set up the State of Israel, including the murders of Lord Moyne, a mediator, and Count Bernadotte, a Swedish aristocrat acting as a United Nations peace maker, who was actively aiding the Zionist cause, but was not moving fast enough to satisfy the terrorists. Another Zionist atrocity was the bombing of the King David Hotel in Palestine, in which many innocent people were killed.  MURDER IS THEIR FOREIGN POLICY After the attempted murder, Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan flew to Washington with a briefcase filled with documentation of Israeli atrocities, but Secretary of State Madeleine Albright claimed she was too busy to see him. He was quoted in the Washington Post : “The Jewish state’s tradition of glorifying covert killing is part of Israel’s intention not to become a country that is part of the region.” A senior American diplomat was quoted as stating, “It’s a basic view of post-Holocaust Jews.” His father, King Hussein of Jordan, was furious that the killers would boldly carry out an “assignment” in his capital. He is the only Arab leader who made peace with Israel, thereby making himself vulnerable to attack from other Arabs. Knowing the ways of the killers, Hussein knew that there had to be an antidote to the poison, in case the killers spilled some on themselves during the assassination. He demanded that Israel make the antidote available, which was agreed to, saving Meshal’s"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"life, and further demanded that the Israelis release the ailing founder of Hamas from prison. A 6l-year-old quadriplegic serving life in an Israeli prison, Sheik Ahmed Yassin had spent eight years in a dismal Israeli cell. Not only did the Israeli Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, release Yassin, who returned home to the plaudits of cheering crowds, but 70 more political prisoners were also released by the Zionists. The Washington Post noted on Oct. 8, 1997, that “A defiant Netanyahu, having ordered agents of Mossad, the Israeli espionage agency, to assassinate Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal in Amman last month, appointed a ‘three-man clarification committee’ to investigate the affair. The three committee members are business figures who worked in the past for the defense and intelligence establishments. The choice was criticized because all three are known to be very close to Netanyahu.” In so many words, the Prime Minister appointed a committee of cronies to whitewash his ordering of the assassination. No other nation has its top political officer personally order and approve murders. BUSINESS AS USUAL Not only has terrorism been an essential part of the establishment of the State of Israel -- it is still an established policy. Barton Gellmann writes in the Washington Post , Oct. 12, 1997, “Israeli law not only sanctions assassinations but regularizes it to some extent. At roughly the same time that the U.S. Congress passed the assassination ban, then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir set up twin committees -- a forum of security service chiefs known by its Hebrew acronym, Varash, and a selection of government ministers known as the X Committee, to vet [sic] candidates for assassination by the Mossad, Israel’s espionage agency.” Thus Gellman reveals that at the highest levels of Israeli government, politicians meet to solemnly “vet” candidates for assassination! The Washington Post reported on October 13, that Jordan expelled all undercover agents accredited to the Israeli Embassy, and suspended security cooperation with Israel. The Post’s editors editorially expressed no moral concern about the attempted assassination, but did suggest on October 7, in a very mild editorial titled “An Operation Gone Wrong”, as an alternative measure to such attempts, “an integrated diplomatic strategy”. The victim, Khaled Meshal, denounced the attempt as “state terrorism”, which describes the history of the State of Israel. In order to understand why Israel is founded on terrorism, we must look at the history of the area. In the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds began to finance Jewish settlements in the Arab area of Palestine. In 1947, when the United Nations ordered the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab sectors, there were 630,000 Jews and 1,300,000 Arabs living there. The Jews were a 31% minority. Mass terror was their only option to drive the Arabs out and take over the country. In 1940, Joseph Weitz, head of the Jewish Agency there, wrote, “We shall not achieve our goal if the Arabs are in this small country. There is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to neighboring countries -- all of them. Not one village, not one tribe should be left.” From its inception, the Zionists have had but one goal: the elimination of the Arab presence in Palestine."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" FORGED PASSPORTS To protect their professional assassins, Mossad has used forged passports to give them false identities. The Washington Post noted Oct. 10, “the Israel custom of using forged Canadian passports” to protect its murder raids in other countries. If apprehended, the killers would claim asylum at the Canadian Embassy, and then escape the country. Because Canada’s government is dominated by the wealth of Zionist billionaires such as the Reichmanns and the Bronfmans, complicity of leading Canadian politicians was involved in the notorious use of forged Canadian passports by Mossad’s killers. With its sordid conspiracy exposed, Canada responded by ending the practice, and by recalling its Ambassador to Israel, Daniel Berger, as a token protest. Canada claimed that Israel had reneged on a previous promise to stop using forged Canadian passports, revealing that Canadian officials had been aware of the practice for years. On October 11, the Washington Post gave extensive coverage to the passport issue, noting that Israel had been caught using Canadian passports before. The two assassins captured in Amman had Canadian passports in the names of Shawn Kendall and Barry Beads. To add to the mystery, the real Shawn Kendall, a Toronto native, was found working in Israel, and interviewed. He told the Post that he was “an innocent victim”, but offered no explanation as to why the killers were using his name. ZIONISTS INTRODUCED TERRORISM Although the Zionist media in the United States is always careful to define “terrorism” as an Arab technique, it was the Zionists who made terrorism an active force in modern politics. Israel’s leaders from its inception as a state have always had their activities founded in ties to the terrorist operations of world Zionism. Golda Meir, who was for many years Prime Minister of Israel, has always been touted as a harmless Milwaukee school teacher. In fact, she was for many years the active head of Mossad terrorist activities in the United States, and directed its worldwide operations. She financed its work with millions of dollars siphoned from the budget of the Chicago Department of Sewers, an arrangement set up for her by the Zionist political boss of Chicago, the notorious “Colonel” Jake Arvey. The paychecks of as many as 12,000 “ghost workers” were sent to Meir each month to finance Mossad. Typical was the career of Yitzhak Shamir, who became Prime Minister of Israel in the 1980s, after serving as a deputy director of Mossad. He was a professional gunman who had such an aptitude for his work that he was placed in charge of all political assassinations. We should not be surprised that the present Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, personally ordered the murder of Meshal. ANCIENT TRADITION OF ASSASSINATION There would be no State of Israel today without its long traditions of assassinating political opponents. In the nineteenth century, the Jewish Bund laid the foundations of the Soviet Union by assassinating numerous Czars and high-ranking Russian officials during the"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"nineteenth century. These leaders were killed, not because they were “oppressors”, but because they were liberals. The terrorists realized that their liberal policies would ameliorate the sufferings of the people, as they were intended to do, and that these Czars and their officials must be killed before they could reduce political tensions in Russia. As Jewish author Samuel Roth points out in his historic work Jews Must Live , “anti- Semitism is the lifeblood of the Jewish race.” What he is saying is that without the spur of anti-Semitism, Jews would assimilate and disappear. As Ralph Schoenman points out in his historic work The Hidden History of Zionism , Veritas Press, 1988, p. 47, “The founders of Zionism despaired of combating anti-Semitism and paradoxically, regarded the anti- Semites themselves as allies, because of shared desire to remove the Jews from the countries in which they lived. The Zionist movement came to regard the anti-Semites themselves as their most responsible sponsors and protectors.” Schoenman points out that during the Nazi era in Germany, the Zionists occupied a position of preference. In May 1935, Reinhardt Heydrich, the chief of the S.S. Security Service, wrote an article in which he separated Jews into ‘two categories’. The Jews he favored were the Zionists. “Our good wishes together with our good will go with them.” The Zionist Federation of Germany sent a memorandum of support to the Nazi party on June 21, 1933, stating, “a rebirth of national life such as is occurring in German life, must also take place in the Jewish national group. On the foundation of the new (Nazi) state which has established the principle of race, we wish to fit our community into the total structure so that for us too, in the sphere assigned to us, fruitful activity for the Fatherland is possible.” Schoenman points out that the World Zionist Organization broke the Jewish boycott and became the principal distributor of Nazi goods throughout the Middle East and Northern Europe, at a time when the German economy was extremely vulnerable. He recounts many pages of collaboration between the Zionists and the Nazi regime. Adolf Eichmann was invited to Palestine as the guest of the Haganah, the Zionist terrorist group! ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE UNITED STATES In 1950, Jewish leaders were given a survey which showed that the Jewish community would soon cease to exist in the United States, because of the rapid assimilation of Jews into the American mainstream. As a result, the Jewish leaders commissioned the Anti- Defamation League of B’Nai B’Rith, a Jewish Masonic organization, to seek out, publicize and assist “anti-Semites” anywhere in the United States. The leaders believed that only the threat of an American Holocaust would bring Jews back into the community. The task seemed monumental. Not only was there no anti-Semitic activity in the peaceful American social structure -- the United States has been known for two centuries as a sanctuary for Jews from all over the world. Nevertheless, the Anti-Defamation League set about its assigned task, to persuade American Jews that there would soon be a Holocaust in the United States. With unlimited funds, but with very little actual “anti-Semitism” to work with, the ADL has tirelessly publicized “anti-Semitism” in the United States for almost half a century. During this period, much to their dismay, not a single Jew has ever been killed here! Nevertheless, they issue statistical reports of “anti-Semitic acts”, force Congress to pass a “hate-crimes” bill,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"and promote the “threat” of anti-Semitism with national coverage given to any event which might be remotely interpreted as being “anti-Jewish”. They have a twenty-eight-million dollar annual budget as a tax exempt organization whose sole function is to stir up and promote racial hatred and discord in the United States. Working with Mossad and the American Israel Political Action Committee in Washington, they form an unholy trinity which terrorizes public debate and political activity in the United States. No political figure dares incur their wrath, which means the sudden end of their career, as such esteemed figures as Senator William Fulbright and many Congressmen have discovered. No Washington politician has dared to comment on the Khaled Meshal attempted assassination, for fear of bringing about his political destruction. Mossad agents themselves often play an active role in determining the outcome of elections in the U.S. Typical was the race of Democrat Lynn Yeakel in Pennsylvania against Republican Arlen Specter. Although Yeakel was ardently pro-Israel, Mossad did not wish to see him replace the Zionist agitprop activist, Specter. Yoram Ettinger, the Mossad’s congressional operative, put all his influence behind Specter. Yeakel lost half the Jewish vote; Specter squeaked in by only three percent. When Pennsylvanians voted for Specter in the delusion that they were thereby supporting the State of Israel, they did not realize that in effect they were supporting only the terrorists wing of the Israeli government, the Mossad connection which produces its Prime Ministers. WORLDWIDE KILLING OPERATION The attempted murder of an Arab leader in Jordan is, as the Washington Post sorrowfully pointed out, “An Operation Gone Wrong”, meaning that the killers were caught, and the victim survived. Whether it will alert Americans to the terrorists operating in their midst, with the full sanction of the Washington politicians, remains to be seen. After the 1972 Munich Olympics, during which some Israeli athletes were killed, Golda Meir directed the Mossad to find all those responsible and kill them. Ahmad Bouchiki, a Moroccan waiter in a Norwegian ski resort, Lillehammer, was mistaken by Mossad killers for Ali Hassan Salameh, a security aide to PLO leader Yassir Arafat, and the man reputed to have planned the Munich operation. The Mossad killed Bouchiki, only to find that they had killed the wrong man. Israel had to exert tremendous influence in Norway to recover from this blunder. The killings proceeded despite this error. In 1979, Mossad caught up to Salameh and killed him in Beirut. In 1988, Mossad agents killed Khalid Wazr, who was Arafat’s senior deputy. In 1995, they killed Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shiarai in Malta. The following year, they used a booby-trapped cellular phone to kill Yekuza Ayash, a Hamas operator known as ‘the ENGINEER” in Gaza City. The Mossad killers operate worldwide, including in the United States, with the full support not only of Israel’s political leaders, but with the support of the entire Israel population. In a spirited radio debate after the Meshal incident, the leader of the Third Way political party in Israel not only argued that Israel should engage in political assassinations throughout the world, but opened a debate as to whether such assassinations should take place in “friendly countries”, such as Jordan and the United States!"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY This latest Mossad atrocity offers American voters a window of opportunity. This is the time to notify your Congressman that you no longer wish to see billions of dollars each year of the tax monies extorted from you by brute force to be used for hired killers roaming the world in search of their unsuspecting targets. Perhaps Khaled Meshal will be the instrument for liberating Americans from the unholy trinity of the Anti-Defamation League, the Mossad, and the American Israel Political Action Committee, which routinely terrorizes our elected representatives in Washington. We must not fail to act on this unexpected opportunity. Act now to protect yourself from the worldwide terrorism which is paid for by your tax monies! ************************************************ 33.) Excerpt From Murder By Injection:  The Story Of The Medical Conspiracy Against America One of the few doctors who has dared to speak out against the Medical Monopoly, Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn, dramatized his stand against Modern Medicine by defining it as a Church which has Four Holy Waters. The first of these, he listed as Vaccination. Dr. Mendelsohn termed vaccination “of questionable safety.” However, other doctors have been more explicit. It is notable that the Rockefeller interests have fought throughout the nineteenth century to make these Four Holy Waters compulsory throughout the United States, ignoring all the protests and warnings of their dangers. Of these four items, which might well be termed the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, because they too are known to bring death and destruction in their wake, the most pernicious in its long-term effects may well be the practice of immunization. This practice goes directly against the discovery of modern holistic medical experts that the body has a natural immune defense against illness. The Church of Modern Medicine claims that we can only be absolved from the peril of infection by the Holy Water of vaccination, injecting into the system a foreign body of infection, which will then perform a Medical Miracle, and will confer life-long immunity, hence the term, “immunization.” The greatest heresy any physician can commit is to voice publicly any doubt of any one of the Four Holy Waters, but the most deeply entrenched in modern medical practice is undoubtedly the numerous vaccination programs. They are also the most consistently profitable operations of the Medical Monopoly. Yet one physician, Dr. Henry R. Bybee, of Norfolk, Virginia, has publicly stated, “My honest opinion is that vaccine is the cause of more disease and suffering than anything I could name. I believe that such diseases as cancer, syphilis, cold sores and many other disease conditions are the direct results of vaccination. Yet, in the state of Virginia, and in many other states, parents are compelled to submit their children to this procedure while the medical profession not only receives its pay for this service, but also makes splendid and prospective patients for the future.”"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"From London comes an alarming observation from a practitioner of excellent reputation and long experience. Dr. Herbert Snow, senior surgeon at the Cancer Hospital of London, voiced his concern, “In recent years many men and women in the prime of life have dropped dead suddenly, often after attending a feast or a banquet. I am convinced that some eighty percent of these deaths are caused by the inoculation or vaccination they have undergone. They are well known to cause grave and permanent disease of the heart. The coroner always hushes it up as “natural causes”. You cannot find any such warning in any medical textbook or popular book on health. In fact, this writer was able to locate it in a small volume buried deep in the stacks in the Library of Congress. Yet such an ominous observation from an established medical practitioner should be as widely circulated as possible, if only to be attacked by those who can refute its premise. At least it cannot be attacked by the Establishment as quackery, because Dr. Snow is not attempting to sell some substitute for vaccination, but merely warning of its dangers. Another practitioner, Dr. W. B. Clarke of Indiana, finds that “Cancer was practically unknown until compulsory vaccination with cowpox vaccine began to be introduced. I have had to deal with at least two hundred cases of cancer, and I never saw a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person.” At last, we have the breakthrough for which the American Cancer Society has been searching, at such great expense, and for so many years. Dr. Clarke has never seen a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person. Is not this a lead which should be explored? In the land where freedom rings, or is supposed to ring, it is even more surprising to find that every citizen is compelled to submit to a compulsory vaccination ritual. Here again, we are speaking of a civilization which is now being visited by two plagues, the plague of cancer and the plague of AIDS, yet compulsory vaccination offers no protection against the plagues which threaten us. It is goodbye whooping cough, goodbye diptheria and hello AIDS. The Medical Monopoly is searching desperately for some type of “immunization” against these plagues, and no doubt will eventually come up with some type of “vaccine” which will be more dreadful than the disease. From the outset, our most distinguished medical experts have proudly informed us that AIDS is incurable, which is hardly the approach we expect from those who demand that we accept their infallibility in all things to do with medicine. Another well known medical practitioner, Dr. J. M. Peebles of San Francisco, has written a book on vaccine, in which he says, “The vaccination practice, pushed to the front on all occasions by the medical profession through political connivance made compulsory by the state, has not only become the chief menace and the greatest danger to the health of the rising generation, but likewise the crowning outrage upon the personal liberties of the American citizen; compulsory vaccination, poisoning the crimson currents of the human system with brute-extracted lymph under the strange infatuation that it would prevent smallpox, was one of the darkest blots that disfigured the last century.”"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Dr. Peebles refers to the fact that cowpox vaccine was one of the more peculiar “inventions or discoveries of the Age of Enlightment.” However, as I have pointed out in The Curse Of Canaan , the Age of Enlightenment was merely the latest program of the Cult of Baal and its rituals of child sacrifice, which, in one guise or another, has now been with us for some five thousand years. Because of this goal, the Medical Monopoly is also known as “The Society for Crippling Children.” Perhaps the most telling comment of Dr. Peebles’ criticism is his reference to “brute- extracted lymph.” Could there be some connection between the injection of this substance and the spread of a hitherto unknown form of cancer, cancer of the lymph glands? This type of cancer is not only one of the most commonly encountered versions of this disease; it is also one of the most difficult to treat, because it rapidly spreads throughout the entire system. A diagnosis of cancer of the lymph glands now means a virtual death sentence. In an article in Science , March 4, 1977, Jonas and Darrell Salk warn that, “Live virus” vaccines against influenza or poliomyelitis may in each instance produce the disease it intended to prevent... the live virus against measles and mumps may produce such side effects as encephalitis (brain damage).” If vaccines present such a clear and present danger to children who are forced to submit to them, we must examine the forces which demand that they submit. In the United States, vaccines are actively and incessantly promoted as the solution for all infectious diseases by such government agencies as the Centers for Disease Control in Georgia, by HEW, USPHS, FDA, AMA and WHO. It is of more than passing interest that the federal agencies should be such passionate supporters of compulsory use of vaccines, and that they also should go through the “revolving door” to the big drug firms whose products they have so assiduously promoted, throughout their years of service to the public. It is these federal agents who have drafted the procedures which forced the states to enact compulsory vaccination legislation which had been drafted by the attorneys for the Medical Monopoly, to become “the law of the land.” Medical historians have finally come to the reluctant conclusion that the great flu “epidemic” of 1918 was solely attributable to the widespread use of vaccines. It was the first war in which vaccination was compulsory for all servicemen. The Boston Herald reported that forty-seven soldiers had been killed by vaccination in one month. As a result, the military hospitals were filled, not with wounded combat casualties, but with casualties of the vaccines. The epidemic was called “the Spanish Influenza,” a deliberately misleading appellation, which was intended to conceal its origin. This flu epidemic claimed twenty million victims; those who survived it were the ones who had refused the vaccine. In recent years, annual recurring epidemics of flu recalled “the Russian Flu.” For some reason, the Russians never protest, perhaps because the Rockefellers make regular trips to Moscow to lay down the party line. The perils of vaccination were already known. Plain Talk magazine notes that “during the Franco-Prussian War, every German soldier was vaccinated. The result was that 53,288"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"otherwise healthy men developed smallpox. The death rate was high.” In what is now known as “the Great Swine Flu Massacre,” the President of the United States, Gerald Ford, was enlisted to persuade the public to undergo a national vaccinesation campaign. The moving force behind the scheme was a $135 million windfall profit for the major drug manufacturers. They had a “swine flu” vaccine which suspicious pig raisers had refused to touch, fearful it might wipe out their crop. The manufacturers had only tried to get $80 million from the swine breeders; balked in this sale, they turned to the other market, humans. The impetus for the national swine flu vaccine came directly from the Disease Control Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Perhaps coincidentally, Jimmy Carter, a member of the Trilateral Commission, was then planning his presidential campaign in Georgia. The incumbent President, Gerald Ford, had all the advantages of a massive bureaucracy to aid him in his election campaign, while the ineffectual and little known Jimmy Carter offered no serious threat to the election. Suddenly, out of Atlanta, came the Centers for Disease Control plan for a national immunization campaign against “swine flu.” The fact that there was not a single known case of this flu in the United States did not deter the Medical Monopoly from their scheme. The swine breeders had been shocked by the demonstrations of the vaccine on a few pigs, which had collapsed and died. One can imagine the anxious conferences in the headquarters of the great drug firms, until one bright young man remarked, “Well, if the swine breeders won’t inject it into their animals, our only other market is to inject it into people.” The Ford-sponsored swine flu campaign almost died an early death, when a conscientious public servant, Dr. Anthony Morris, formerly of HEW and then active as director of the Virus Bureau of the Food and Drug Administration, declared that there could be no authentic swine flu vaccine, because there had never been any cases of swine flu on which they could test it. Dr. Morris then went public with his statement that “at no point were the swine flu vaccines effective.” He was promptly fired, but the damage had been done. The damage control consisted of that great humanitarian, Walter Cronkite, and the President of the United States, combining their forces to come to the rescue of the Medical Monopoly. Walter Cronkite had President Ford appear on his news program to urge the American people to submit to the inoculation with the swine flu vaccine. CBS then or later could never find any reason to air any analysis or scientific critique of the swine flu vaccine, which was identified as containing many toxic poisons, including alien viral protein particles, formaldehyde, theimorosal (a derivative of poisonous mercury), polysorbate and some eighty other substances. Meanwhile, back at the virus laboratories, after Dr. Anthony Morris has been summarily fired, a special team of workers was rushed in to clean out the four rooms in which he had conducted his scientific tests. The laboratory was filled with animals whose records verified his claims, representing some three years of constant research. All of the animals were immediately destroyed, and Morris’ records were burned. They did not go so far as to sow salt throughout the area, because they believed their job was done. On April 15, 1976, Congress passed Public Law 94-266, which provided $135 million of taxpayers’ funds to pay for a national swine flu inoculation campaign. HEW was to"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"distribute the vaccine to state and local health agencies on a national basis for inoculation, at no charge. Insurance agencies then went public with their warning that they would not insure drug firms against possible studies from the results of swine flu inoculation, because no studies had been carried out which could predict its effects. It was to foil the insurance companies that CBS had Gerald Ford make his impassioned appeal to 215,000,000 Americans to save themselves while there was still time, and to rush down to the friendly local health department and get the swine flu vaccination, at absolutely no charge. This may have been CBS’ finest hour in its distinguished career of “public service.” Hardly had the swine flu campaign been completed than the reports of the casualties began to pour in. Within a few months, claims totaling $1.3 billion had been filed by victims who had suffered paralysis from the swine flu vaccine. The medical authorities proved equal to the challenge; they leaped to the defense of the Medical Monopoly by labeling the new epidemic, “Guillain-Barre Syndrome.” There have since been increasing speculations that the ensuing epidemic of AIDS which began shortly after Gerald Ford’s public assurances, were merely a viral variation of the swine flu vaccine. And what of the perpetrator of the Great Swine Flu Massacre, President Gerald Ford? As the logical person to blame for the catastrophe, Ford had to endure a torrent of public criticism, which quite naturally resulted in his defeat for election (he had previously been appointed when the agents of the international drug operations had ushered Richard Nixon out of office). The unknown Jimmy Carter, familiar only to the supersecret fellow members of the Trilateral Commission, was swept into office by the outpouring of rage against Gerald Ford. Carter proved to be almost as serious a national disaster as the swine flu epidemic, while Gerald Ford was retired from politics to life. Not only did he lose the election, he was also sentenced to spend his remaining years trudging wearily up and down the hot sandy stretches of the Palm Springs Golf course. At the annual ACS Science Writers Seminar, Dr. Robert W. Simpson, of Rutgers University, warned that “immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body... they can then become activated as a variety of diseases including lupus, cancer, rheumatism and arthritis.” This was a remarkable verification of the earlier warning delivered by Dr. Herbert Snow of London more than fifty years earlier. He had observed that the long-term effects of the vaccines, lodging in the heart or other parts of the body, would eventually result in fatal damage to the heart. The vaccine becomes a time bomb in the system, festering as what are known as “slow viruses”, which may take ten to thirty years to become virulent. When that time arrives, the victim is felled by a fatal onslaught, often with no prior warning, whether it is a heart attack or some other disease. Herbert M. Shelton wrote in 1938 in his book, Exploitation Of Human Suffering that “Vaccine is pus -- either septic or inert -- if inert it will not take -- if septic it produces infection.” This explains why some children have to go back and receive a second inoculation, because the first one did not “take” -- it was not sufficiently poisonous, and did not infect the body. Shelton says that the inoculations cause sleeping sickness, infantile"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"paralysis, haemophlagia or tetanus. The Surgeon General of the United States, Leonard Scheele, pointed out to the annual AMA convention in 1955 that “No batch of vaccine can be proven safe before it is given to children.” James R. Shannon of the National Institute of Health declared that, “The only safe vaccine is a vaccine that is never used.”"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"With the advent of Dr. Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine in the 1950s American parents were assured that the problem had been solved, and that their children were now safe. The ensuing suits against the drug manufacturers received little publicity. David v. Wyeth Labs, a suit involving Type 3 Sabin Polio Vaccine, was judged in favor of the plaintiff, David. A suit against Lederle Lab involving Orimune Vaccine was settled in 1962 for $10,000. In two cases involving Parke-Davis’ Quadrigen, the product was found to be defective. In 1962, Parke-Davis halted all production of Quadrigen. The medical loner, Dr. William Koch, declared that “The injection of any serum, vaccine, or even penicillin has shown a very marked increase in the incidence of polio, at lest by 400%.” The Centers for Disease Control stayed out of sight for some time after the Great Swine Flu Massacre, only to emerge more stridently than ever with a new national scare program on the dangers of another plague, which was named “Legionnaires’ Disease” after an outbreak at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. ************************************************ 34.) Terrorism in Washington 11/16/91 On Sept. 17, 1991, the nation’s capital, Washington D.C. went on Red Alert. This alert was not sounded by any threat of war, but by a tip from Tel Aviv that President George Bush had been marked for immediate assassination, and that two of Mossad’s most experienced assassins, Bar-Neva and Epstein, were already in place in Washington and preparing to carry out their latest assignment. “President Bush to be assassinated by Mossad? Bush, the friend of Israel?” exclaimed a New York Times bureau reporter, on hearing of the Red Alert. In fact, the State of Israel had no choice. Its entire economy depends upon immediate granting of a 100% loan guarantee by the United States Treasury to the State of Israel, a grant which will cost, at the outset, $1.9 billion in cash guarantees and immediate expenditures by the Treasury, and, in total over the next several years, an actual cash outlay of $177 billion. When Bush flatly refused to issue the guarantee, in view of upcoming Middle East peace talks, Israel had no choice but to act at once. The first announcement of Israel’s reaction to Bush’s modest request for a 120 day delay in granting the $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel came from a member of the Israeli cabinet, who publicly denounced Bush as a liar and antisemite. The public use of the term “anti- Semite”, by one of the highest ranking members of the Israeli government was not merely political invective; it was an official notification that Bush was now a candidate for immediate assassination. Whenever anyone, anywhere in the world, is publicly branded an “anti-Semite”, particularly by a member of the Israeli government, it means that he can"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"now be assassinated by any Israeli agent, at any time. The term “anti-Semite” is a code word for “marked for destruction by the forces of Zionism”. Although Bush was shocked by this public denunciation by the Israeli government, he did not understand its full implications until an old friend from his CIA days, Mike Harari, tipped him off that it was a murder raid. Harari was repaying Bush’s favor in removing him from Panama by secret courier before Noriega was arrested in the Panama expedition. Now Harari hopes that Bush will request he be sent to Washington as ambassador of Israel, in return for this latest tipoff. But Harari cannot come to the U.S. until the Noriega trial is concluded, as he was the mastermind of the Noriega drug operation! ************************************************ 35.) What Happened In Moscow? 11/16/91 The question of what actually happened in Moscow recently, the coup that never was (a coup, by definition, is a successful seizure of power) whether Gorbachev is out or Yeltsin is in, has not been answered by the pundits because there are no pundits -- there are only paid prostitutes, propagandists echoing the will of their unseen masters. What happened in Moscow was the culmination of an information process which had been unfolding for the past five years -- the widespread dissemination of revelations in my books which had been flooding Russia in samisdat. The most important revelation was that Communism had never been a Russian political party! On the contrary, it was the weapon which international provocateurs had used to keep Russia in the 19th century while its riches were plundered by the conspirators. Once it had been looted, the conspirators then used tax money from Western nations, primarily the United States, to keep it from sinking to the bottom. For five decades, the Russian people accepted the propaganda that, whatever its faults, at least the Soviet government was a genuine Russian political movement, and that it was hardly as brutal as the Czars repression. This was a direct contradiction of the historical record that at the height of the Czars’ counterattack against Communist Revolutionaries, only a few thousand were sent to Siberia, whereas Dzerzhinsky had hardly set up the OGPU before millions of native Russians were sent to the gulags to starve, work and die. Sixty-seven million perished from 1917 to 1967. When my books, which went directly to Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and other leaders in Russia, exposed the fact that Communism had never been anything but a foreign-operated mechanism, a Communist occupation government with the code name, COG, its leaders could no longer sustain it. However, there was no mass reaction. The Moscow uprising, in an area of ten million people, consisted of from 2500 to 3500 Russians. The others had gone to work as usual. One of the great myths of political force is the fantasy of \"mass political action” deliberately"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"encouraged by the Marxists, who prated of “the masses” while they ruled as a small, compact Nomenklatura, or privileged officials, in a nation of 280 million disenfranchised slaves.

Next -- the downfall of COG in the United States. ************************************************ 36.) Some Illuminating Background On The Character “John Coleman\" Agent-Agitator Finally Exposed (Editor’s note: Regular readers will recall that much space in the 9/8/92 LIBERATOR was devoted to explaining an insipid array of attacks from one “Dr. John Coleman\" aka John Clarke and likely actually one Joseph Pavlonski, of Russian Khazarian origin. It seems that some of the excellent sources “Coleman” \"borrowed\" material from have seen fit to discuss this colorful character and in so doing, provide an illuminating -- if sadly destructive -- pattern of activity we would share with our readers. The following is an extract from an article purportedly by Eustace Mullins in Lawrence Patterson’s publication Criminal Politics for July or August of 1992.) A specter is haunting the American conservative movement -- a specter using an alias (among others) of Dr. John Coleman. Coleman bills himself as “the World’s Greatest Intelligence Expert -- with secret but highly placed ties to British Intelligence.\" He appeared out of the blue at a Bob White, Sound Monetary Conference meeting in Costa Rica in 1984. With no sponsorship -- other than the seminar sponsor, a Dr. Harold Brown -- and no documentation, Coleman managed to convince the attendees that he was indeed one of the world’s important experts on international intelligence. He claimed to be privy to the most carefully guarded secrets of the individuals who clandestinely rule the world. However, Coleman said he would share these secrets only if certain carefully observed guidelines were maintained. The most important of these was that he would never be asked to furnish any personal background information -- any documentation or any source from which he obtained his “secret information.” Such restrictions would scream \"confidence artist\" to most people. But when he met James K. Warner (editor of the Christian Defense League newspaper) -- in 1984, he justified his refusal to reveal background information on himself or his sources by claiming that “he was subject to assassination threats.” He snared Jim Warner by confiding in him one of his closely guarded secrets -- that his name was not Dr. John Coleman at all, but that it was, in fact, John Clark. Coleman stated that by giving Warner this private information, he was actually placing his life in his hands. As he was an accomplished confidence artist, Coleman convinced Warner that he should"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"offer him a position. Warner responded to him by employing him as a writer for the Christian Defense League Report . Coleman would send in material which indeed contained startling information (but was totally undocumented, [and] would soon win him an enthusiastic following among Warner’s readers. Coleman also supplied a great many audio tapes which were offered to Warner’s readers. Each of course supplying “secret information.” This began a five year relationship which proved to be filled with pitfalls for Warner, who was after all a small underfinanced businessman. Not only did Coleman continue to refuse [to provide] any documentation, but he made frequent demands for salary increases...extra expenses for himself and his family...and advances on his salary which exceeded the projected totals of several years salary. Warner was in no position to meet these demands, but in his anxiety to retain Coleman, he dug deep into his own pocket and also issued frantic fund raising appeals for Coleman. The result was that Warner was nearly bankrupted and conservatives nearly lost an excellent source of out of print books and independent information. It should be noted that it is a common technique for an infiltrator to attempt a financial raid on a host target -- thereby rendering the host target unable to continue in business. An example of this would be the Rockefeller faction attempting to take over the National Rille Association some 15 years ago with a grandiose plan which would have bankrupted the NRA... Mullins Material Had To Be Discontinued... Or Else! There were other problems which Coleman created for Warner. One of them was his continuous demands that Warner cease any articles or sell any books written by myself, Eustace Mullins. I had, in fact, been writing for Warner for more than a decade. Warner attributed this obsession to mere jealousy on Coleman’s part. In fact, it went much deeper. Coleman’s vaunted sources of information were not secret at all, but were discovered by me in the process of reviewing his printed statements. Here are the results of my study: about 30% of his material was lifted from my own writings and about 70% was stolen from Lyndon Larouche publications. Principally, Coleman would rely on feature articles in the Executive Intelligence Review magazine. The material was simply rewritten by Coleman and crudely puffed up to five or six times its original length. Unfortunately, Warner never noticed. Finally I became so concerned about the quantity of material lifted from the Larouche publications by Coleman that I decided to let Jim Warner know that his “new star” was lifting most of his “secrets” from Larouche publications. Some months later, Warner received an indignant letter from the Larouche office, complaining about Coleman‘s plagiarism of the Larouche material. When Warner confronted Coleman, Warner was assured that it was simply an effort by the Larouche"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"group to sow dissension. Coleman claimed he had only seen one copy of the Executive Intelligence Review in his life. Sometime later, when Coleman claimed to have left the country for South Africa, some of his effects were stored at the Warner warehouse. Among them, Warner found two boxes of well-thumbed issues of Larouche magazines. Sure enough, this proved to be the source of many of Coleman’s “British intelligence” connections. But Warner’s readers were trapped, and they were besieging him with requests that he bring Coleman into the public spotlight through meetings and seminars. Coleman finally did appear at some meetings for a few months. But then, Warner was hit with still more demands for more loans and salary advances. He tried to find other employrnent for him, sending him off to a part-time job with a long time supporter, Willlam Makinney, of Florida. Bill Makinney was lured by the promise that Coleman could make some extremely profitable deals for him. Later he was disappointed when Coleman arrived with his wife and son, and Coleman demanded the use of a Lincoln town car and memberships in the most exclusive Palm Beach Clubs and nightly meals in the most expensive restaurants. Even worse he spent much of his time closeted in a room at Makinney’s home. He claimed to be making long distance phone calls to the head of the South African gov’t. Makinney was later unable to find records of any such phone calls in his billing. Soon Makinney asked him to leave and put him on a plane the sadder but wiser. Warner was again assailed by constant demands for more money. Warner finally decided that the only way to meet the demands was to hold public meetings with Coleman as the star. Coleman, who had billed himself as the “World’s Greatest Orator\" proved to be a lack luster speaker, who read in a dull monotone from his type written speech, The rneetings were a failure. Meanwhile, Warner had purchased a car for Coleman’s use and a computer for Coleman’s use at a large home which Warner rented for him. Coleman rarely appeared at the Warner offices citing his fear of assassination. What’s more, Warner discovered at the meetings, Coleman attempted to make financial deals for himself, showing no loyally to Warner whatsoever. Finally, Warner informed him that he was fired. Warner was required to obtain a warrant to cease the automobile and computer that were loaned to him. Then he realized that Coleman had obtained an illicit copy of his mailing list. Coleman began issuing appeals to Warner’s subscribers claiming that I had had him discharged in order to become an editor of another Warner publication. Finally, Coleman showed in Calilornia where he was guest of one Dr. Arnold Geisbret, of Glendale, CA. Geisbret has an interesting background. He is an attendee at many right- wing meetings, including those of Lawrance Patterson’s National Bankruptcy Seminars. He would take copious notes and interrogate everyone that would talk to him. Geisbret, obviously, intended to collect as much information on the right-wing as possible. Coleman, meanwhile, went from one address to the other in California using Warner’s mailing list as a source of suckers."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"At each resident, he would spin a spiteful tale of having been cruelly used by Jim Warner who had taken all of his money. Meanwhile, Coleman would make threatening calls to Warner informing him that he would launch a national campaign against him if he refused to make a financial settlement. Wishing to avoid legal problems, Warner settled a substantial sum of money on Coleman, all to no avail. Coleman not only launched a campaign of denunciation against Warner using his mailing list of subscribers, but he also began a surreptitious mailing campaign using pseudonyms to accuse Warner of sexual offenses and of being a double agent. These defamatory letters were also mailed to Warner's mailing list. Great Success... In Spreading Discord! Coleman was achieving great success in spreading consternation and discord throughout the conservative network. I began to realize his true motives. Rather than a greedy confidence artist -- with an ability to rewrite other’s materials as his own -- it became obvious to me and to those that knew him, that he was more than likely a highly trained double agent, whose handlers would unleash the “attack dog” on an unprepared patriot community a step at a time. One source I have spoken with claimed that he has been trained in Israel by a Mossad unit -- and had been known there as Joseph Pavlonsky. We later discovered that he entered the United States on an English passport recorded by the INS as #A20211168 issued to \"John Clarke.” Interestingly, when Warner accompanied him to get a driver’s license in Louisiana, he claimed he had applied for a social security number although none was forthcoming. Even though he had been in the United States for almost a decade, he had been driving in the Western states on a Louisiana license, and had never obtained a U.S. green card or work permit. On To Carson City, Nevada...As “Space Commander” Next comes Coleman’s employment with one George Green who operates a nonconformist publication titled Phoenix Journal Express which is supposedly representing the statements from a space being -- (yes, we said space being) by the name of Gyorgos Ceres Hatonn!! Hatonn is the claimed commander of a fleet of space ships from the galaxy of Pleiades. These spaceships have been deployed over the California border with Nevada for several years. This has proved to be convenient for all concerned because the people of Pleiades, interestingly enough, do not require a U.S. work permit from its employees. Coleman is now writing the material for Hatonn. Interestingly enough, he gives advice about International Banking, but amazingly, is always negative on Sterling denominated investments and, interestingly, Swiss banking as well. Under the auspices of George Green's Phoenix Journal Express, and America West publishers of Tehachapi, California, Coleman finally published his first and only book “The Committee of Three Hundred\". After examining this book, it has proven to be the usual amalgam of his borrowings from my various textbooks and, again, from the Larouche"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"magazine. The foreword to the book is very revealing. He again takes the opportunity to sow more dissension in the conservative movement. It is a vitriolic denunciation of the movement claiming it was “part of a carefully crafted and orchestrated program to discredit him (Coleman) and run by secret government agents and informers embedded in the so-called Christian right wing “identity movement”. The invective goes on at some length repeating the slanders of his previous circulated hate letters. The Committee of 300 contains nothing new and is an amalgam of others’ materials. Material Lifted From the Anti-Defamation League! Having reviewed the material of the anti-defamation league, I can say that Coleman’s smear attack in his foreword against the \"so-called Christian right wing” is atypical material taken from the guide books of the anti-defamation league. His denunciation of the “identity movement\" is also taken directly from ADL literature. For years the ADL has considered the “identity movement” its number one opponent and target in the United States. A Potent Agitator... Working Against America! Whatever the truth or falsity of the claims of Dr. John Coleman (alias John Clarke, alias Pavlonksy), it is clear that he is a potent agititor working among American conservative publishers. Lawrence Patterson has also had a brush with him and he has recently succeeded in taking in Colonel Arch Roberts, who ran a lengthy review of his book. He has constantly sown seeds of discord and hate for his own devious purposes and will undoubtedly continue to pit patriot against patriot for as long as he is allowed to betray, impede and infiltrate without exposure. Hopefully, this article which has been submitted to Criminal Politics magazine of which I am a contributing editor, will help to expose John Coleman as a foreign agent.
