It is based on lessons learned from both historical and contemporary UW operations. It is al so based on existing, long-standing Army Special Forces (S F) UW doctrine; recently developed doctrine, such as counterinsurgenc y (COIN); and emerging affiliated concepts , such as irregular warfare (IW). PURPOSE Since 11 September 2001 and the onset of the War on Terrorism (WOT), existing UW doctrinal publications have undergone intense scrutiny and timely revision. A majority of e xisting ARSOF manuals have incorporated recent lessons learned and updated tactic s, techniques, and proced ures (TTP) of immediate utility to the conduct of war. For this reason, the Army has classified most of these revised manuals. UW remains an enduring and effective means of warfighting and is recognized as a central effort in th e WOT. Although the classification of existing doctrine is prudent for oper ational security, it limits the distri bution of concepts necessary for an effective joint, interagency, and multinational effort . ARSOF and other audiences require an unclassified conceptual manual useful to understanding the nature of UW and its role in t he nation’s application of power. This manual provides that unclassified conceptual treatment. SCOPE ARSOF execute and are the functiona l proponent for UW under United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directive 10-1, Terms of Reference for Component Commanders , and other authorities. Currently, there exists no authoritative interagency or joint do ctrine specifically for UW—although sufficient joint doctrine does exist for general campaign design and execution of joint and Army opera tions. This manual is the overarching doctrinal reference that specifically addresses UW as conduct ed by ARSOF. Detailed TTP for UW can be found in FM 3-05.201, (S/NF) Special Forces Un conventional Warfare (U) . The first chapter establishes what UW is and includes a comparison of traditional and emerging concepts with which UW is sometimes confused. Chapter 2 discusses the international enviro nment and United States (U.S.) instruments of national power within which all military operations—includi ng UW—occur. Chapter 3 addresses policy and doctrine that define, enable, and constrain UW. Chapter 4 outlines planning considerations for UW. The next three chapters provide a more focused operational discussion of ARS OF’s three main component disciplines: SF operations, Psychological Operations (PSY OP), and Civil Affairs operations (CAO). Chapter 8, which concerns supporting elements and activities of UW, concludes t he basic manual. The appendixes contain useful supplemental information. The first seven appendixes (A–G) provide expan ded and detailed information on U.S. instruments of national power within the broader context of the international environment. Appendix H is a survey of definitions and current academic considera tions concerning historical and cultural concepts useful to the assessment of human environments. Appendix I provides a historical survey of UW . Appendix J contains an outline sketch of change and constancy in the de finition of UW. Current doctrinal references and an expanded bibliography provide a guide for further reading and mature underst anding of UW within the endeavor of war. Both the text and the Glossary identify terms that have joint or A rmy definitions. FM 3-05.130 is the proponent field manual (the authority) for UW, but is not the proponent for any other Army term. APPLICABILITY The primary audience for this manual is leaders and planners at all levels of ARSOF. The manual is useful to a joint, interagency, and multinational audience that may collabora te with ARSOF in the conduct of UW. This publication applies to the Active Army, Army Nati onal Guard (ARNG)/Army National Guard of the United States, and United States Army Reserv e (USAR) unless otherwise stated."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preface 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 v ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION Unless this publication states otherwise, masculine nouns and pronoun s do not refer exclusively to men.

Competition between contending groups using all th eir means of power has always characterized the international environment. In the modern era since the Treaty of Westpha lia (1648), this competition has generally been conceived as occurring between nation-states. Such c ompetition involved all instruments of state power: diplomatic, informati onal, military, and economic (DIME) expanded in some recent policy documents to diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financ ial, intelligence, and law enforcement (DIMEFIL). The overwhelming majority of these comp etitions were peaceful. Most often, nation-states used the military instrument of power peacefully for static defense, as a force-in-being that enabled diplomatic posturing or a credible deterrent, or for essentially nonmilitary purpos es, such as engineering projects or disaster relief. Only when other instruments of national powe r were exhausted or proved inadequate was the military instrument of power wielded to settl e international differences. Claus von Clausewitz famously characterized su ch use of state military power as, “an act of violence to compel the enemy to do our will.” This assertion has been profound ly influential. However, it is too constrained of a vision for applying national power in today’s world. The ancient Sun Tzu is mo re relevant today; although battles should be won, “winning 100 victories in 100 battles i s not the acme of skill; defeating the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.” There is more than one way to compel an enemy. 1-2. Following the conventions of the time, the United States establ ished a standing Continental Army of uniformed regulars who, in combination with guerrilla raiders and a rebellious population, won American independence. In the 19th century, the United States further developed its military power sufficient to expand and defend a young continental nation. In the 20th century, the Unit ed States used its unparalleled military power to successfully concl ude two world wars and provide the credibility required to win a third (albeit “Cold”) war. The late 20th century understood the fullest manifest ation of actual (or potential) war thus defined as the large-scale mobilization and total commitment of mas sive organizations wielding immense destructive power. 1-3. The international environment in the 21st century, however, present s new challenges. The United States possesses overwhelming conventional military s uperiority, and other nation-states recognize that a direct military threat to the United States is a lo sing proposition. Therefore, large-scale and direct conventional war against the United States is increasingly un likely. Competition in the international environment using all instruments of power, however, remains timeless and continuous. Competitors now concentrate on the nonmilitary instruments of power in the natural intercourse between nations. Most such intercourse remains peaceful and rou tine. Enemy competitors, however, use the instruments of power as weapons. Moreover, not all modern enemy competitors are synonymous with nation-states. 1-4. International actors in the curren t era have awakened to the potential of such “unconventional” methods for compelling an enemy to do one’s will. Avoi ding the advantages of U. S. military power, these international actors seek to erode the ability of the United State s to employ that comparative advantage. Using the other instruments of power—especially the informational—t hey seek to employ what is variably referred to as “irregular,” “asymmetri c,” or “unrestricted” warfare. Even when violence is joined, direct methods are generally avoided for th e classic techniques of guerrilla warfare, terrorism, sabotage, subversion, and insurgency. 1-5. Such indirect methods are not unprecedented. Since ancient times, kingdoms and empires have employed psychological warfare to terrorize, demora lize, and subvert their opponents. Guerrillas have attacked and sabotaged where possible to weaken a su perior contending power. Combined with political purpose, such guerrillas and political warriors have sought to resist the occupier, or subvert and overthrow the oppressor. The postcolonial, modern era especially saw the widespre ad expansion of such unconventional methods."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 1-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 1-6. The United States is not unpracticed in using many of these methods. It is accustomed to wielding all instruments of national power. It has effectively done so in the past. At the dawn of the 21st century, the United States still enjoys the largest economy in the world and continues to wield enormous economic and financial influence. The tangible and cultural products produced by the Unite d States are spread across the planet. In addition to its military power, the combin ed weight and multifaceted appeal of this national output enhances the influence of the diplomatic and informational message of the Uni ted States. U.S. military power guarantees and signif icantly enhances the rule of law in the international system. The reach of all these instruments is paralleled by intelligence and law-e nforcement instruments that provide constant feedback of information and respect for international codes of behavior. 1-7. Failing a peaceful resolution of international competition, the U nited States has a tested military capability to use UW. Although such special operati ons (SO) are inherently joint missions of the USSOCOM, the capability has traditiona lly and primarily resided in ARSOF. The spiritual forbearers of American UW can be traced to the colonial period. ARSOF has a direct military lineage of conducting UW, which dates back more than 50 years to the World War II (WWII) Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The United States has conducted UW in support of resistance movements, in surgencies, and ongoing or pending conventional military operations. It has operated by, with, or through irregular forc es against a variety of state and nonstate opponents. Such sensitive opera tions are a high-value component and a specific application of the military instrument of national power. ARSOF UW—p roperly employed within the context of all such power effec tively integrated—is more relevant than ever in the 21st century international environment. UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE 1-8. The definition of UW has evolved over time. The initial doctrina l concept for the United States to conduct UW originated with the cr eation of the OSS during WWII. In that classic context, UW was generally defined in terms of guerrilla and covert ope rations in enemy-held or -influenced territory. The first official Army definition that touched upon aspects of UW appeared in 1950 as “partisan warfare.” In 1951, the Army’s UW assets were consolidated und er the Office of Psychological Warfare, and the Army published the first two field manuals for the conduct of SO (with an emphasi s on UW). By 1955, the first historical manual that specifically linked Army SF to UW (FM 31-20, Special Forces Group ) declared, “UW consists of the three interrelated fields of guer rilla warfare (GW), escape and evasion, and subversion against hostile states.” 1-9. In the subsequent Cold War decad es, the definition expanded and co ntracted, verbiage changed, and missions conceived as a part of this unconventional enterprise were added or subt racted. The common conceptual core has nevertheless remained as working by, with, or th rough irregular surrogates in a clandestine and/or covert manner against opposing actors. It is common for definit ions to evolve, and ARSOF have distilled the definition below to highlight th e essentials of UW and eliminate the nonessential. In this era of definitional and conceptual change, ARSOF—and its joi nt, interagency, and multinational partners—must be unified with a clear and concise understanding of the UW core m ission. 1-10. The current definition of UW is as follows: Operations conducted by, with, or through irregular forces in support of a re sistance movement, an insurgency, or conventional military operations. FM 3-05.201, (S/NF) Special Forces Unconventional Warfare (U) 28 September 2007 This definition reflects two essential criteria: UW must be conducted by, with, or through surrogates; and such surrogates must be irregular forces. Moreover, this definition is consistent with the historical reasons that the United States has conducted UW. UW has been conducted in suppo rt of both an insurgency, such as the Contras in 1980s Nicaragua, and resistance move ments to defeat an occupying power, such as the Mujahideen in 1980s Afghanistan. UW has also been conducted in s upport of pending or ongoing conventional military operations; for example, OSS/Jedburgh activit ies in France and OSS/Detachment 101 activities in the Pacific in WWII and, more recen tly, SF operations in Op eration ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF)/Afghanistan in 2001 and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF)/Iraq in 2003 . Finally and in keeping with the clandestine and/or covert nature of hist orical UW operations, it has involved the conduct of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 1-3 classified surrogate operations. Details of classified operations are in FM 3-05.20, (C) Special Forces Operations (U) , and FM 3-05.201. 1-11. The definition establishes a “litmus test” for clearly differentia ting UW from other activities and clearly establishes the purpose for conducting UW. Including the idea of “by, with, or through surrogates” eliminates any confusion with unilateral direct action (DA), special reconnaissance (SR), or counterterrorism (CT) missions. Identifying the historically demonstrated use of irregular forces as surrogates in the definition eliminates any confusion with foreign intern al defense (FID) or coalition activities using regular forces. The clearly stated pur pose of UW to support insurgencies, resistance movements, and conventional military operations not only eliminat es the possibility of incorrectly characterizing UW as solely an IW activity but also articulates UW’s relevance to the Army and joint forc e by specifying support to other operations. Personnel should not confuse UW with ot her operations that involve indigenous personnel, such as FID. The United States characterizes FID a s an overt, direct method of assistance to free and protec t a host nation (HN) government from insurgency or lawlessness. Forces conduct FID with recognized HN regular forces. These forces are armed individuals or groups of individuals w ho are members of the regular armed force, police force, or other in ternal security force of that nation. There may be instances in which the United Stat es or the HN overtly employs civilian personnel to enhance operational effect iveness; however, those personnel are openly recognized as an augmentation to the regular forces of the HN. Army and joint doctrine currently do not define regulars, or regular forces . For use in this manual, these forces are defined as being opposite of irregular forces. Regulars are armed individuals or groups of individuals who are member s of a regular armed force, police, or other internal security fo rce. Once a nation charters or sponsors a force to provide internal security, that force is considered to be a regular force. Regardless of its appearance or naming c onvention, if the force operates under governmental control, it is a regular force. Irregulars, or irregular forces, are individuals or groups of individuals who are not members of a regular armed force, police, or other internal security force. They are usually nonstate-sponsored and unconstrained by sovereign nation legalities and boundaries. These forces may include, but are not limited to, specific paramilitary forces, contractors, individuals, businesses , foreign political organizations, resistance or insurgent organizations, expatriates, transnational terrorism adversaries, disillusioned transnational terrorism members, black marketers, and other social or political “undesirables.” 1-12. However, the definition of UW is not simply a list of essential criteri a and rationales connected end-to-end. It is the most concise definition possible that allo ws for the essential UW criteria and rationales, and explicitly or implicitly answers the “who, what, when, where, and why” questions of a military definition. For example, working “by, with, or through” is havin g one act on the behalf of another so the commonly used concept of “surrogate” is implied. Moreover, the one on whos e behalf action is taken implies the “who” and is likewise unnecessary. The “w hat and why” questions are explicitly answered by UW’s purpose as stated above, an d the “when and where” are implicit in the times and spaces the purpose is being pursued. 1-13. Given the ongoing utility of UW in the WOT era, and in the context of the e merging IW effort, it is equally important to highlight what UW is not. It is not simply a catchall phrase fo r anything that is not conventional, regular, or traditional. It is synonym ous neither with the emerging term “irregular warfare” nor with the currently influential (but nondoctrinal) terms “asymmetric warfare,” “unrestricted warfare,” or “fourth-generation warfare” (although there are conceptual similarities). Moreover, and despite widespread confusion outside of ARSOF, UW is not synonymous with either “special operations” or “guerrilla warfare.” All UW operations are special operations, but not all sp ecial operations are UW. Although GW is"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 1-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 a classic inherent component of UW and is featured in many historical defi nitions, UW is an operation, whereas GW is a technique. CONVENTIONAL WARFARE 1-14. The traditional meaning of UW and how it differs from conventional warfare has been clear to ARSOF for more than a half-century. Commentators outside the ARSOF com munity, however, have often misused the term. One reason for this conceptual confusion is that convent ional warfare is not defined in either Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms , or FM 1-02, Operational Terms and Graphics . 1-15. The Irregular Warfare Joint Operating Concept (IW JOC), Version 1.0, date d 11 September 2007, describes conventional or “traditional” warfare as: A form of warfare between states that employs direct military c onfrontation to defeat an adversary’s armed forces, destroy an adversary’s war-making capacity , or seize or retain territory in order to force a change in an adversary’s government or policies. The focus of conventional military operations is norma lly an adversary’s armed forces with the objective of influencing the adversary’s government. It generally assumes th at the indigenous populations within the operational area are no nbelligerents and will accept whatever political outcome the be lligerent governments impose, arbitrate, or negotiate. A fundamental military objective in conventional military operat ions is to minimize civilian interference in those operations. 1-16. UW is a specific military operation and is not merely the inverse of conventiona l war as defined above. UW can be employed against either state or no nstate actors. The directness or indirectness of UW varies according to the situation, th e level of warfare, and over time. A lthough it usually seeks to destroy or weaken an opponent’s war-making capability, this effort may or may not i nvolve direct military confrontation. When UW does involve such confronta tion, forces take special care to attempt engagement only during circumstances advantageous to the resist ance or insurgent force. Seizure and retention of terrain is rarely achieved directly and only achieved decisivel y as a result of overall victory in the larger strategic campaign. The focus of UW is the leveraging of others, who may or may not t hen focus on the adversary’s armed forces. UW generally assumes that some port ion of the indigenous populations— sometimes a majority of that population—are either bellig erents or in support of the UW operation. UW is specifically focused on leveraging the unwillingness of some portion of the indige nous population to accept the status quo or “whatever political outcome the bellig erent governments impose, ar bitrate, or negotiate.” A fundamental military objective in UW is the deliberate involveme nt and leveraging of civilian interference in the unconventional warfare operational area (UWOA). IRREGULAR WARFARE 1-17. For some, the emerging concept of IW risks adding further confusion to what is unconventional in warfare. Along with many other operations, UW is now considered a component part of IW. It is first necessary to understand how IW differs from conventional warfare, followed by a clarification of how IW relates to UW. Just as UW is a special operation but not all special operations are UW, UW is an IW activity but not all IW activities are UW. 1-18. The 9/11 terrorist attack on the United States hi ghlighted the increased danger of warfare conducted by other-than-state enemies. Recognizing that such irregular threats by nonstate actors would be a likely and even dominant pattern throughout the 21st century, national policy m akers dictated that planners must analyze and prepare for such irregul ar threats. It was clear that pr evious assumptions about the terms “conventional,” “traditional,” or “reg ular” warfare, and reliance solely on a “regular” or “conventional warfare” doctrine were inadequate. IW was a significant theme in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report. In April 2006, the Pentagon drafted the exec ution roadmap for IW as a means of combating this growing threat from actions beyond conventional state-to-state mi litary conflict. 1-19. JP 1-02 defines IW as “a violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations. IW favors indirect and asymmetric approaches, though it may"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 1-5 employ the full range of military and other capacities in order to erod e an adversary’s power, influence, and will.” IW is inherently a protracted conflict that will test the resolve of the United States and its partn ers. Adversaries will pursue IW strategies, employing a hybrid of irregular, disruptive, traditional, and catastrophic capabilities to undermine and erode the infl uence and will of the United States and its strategic partners. Meeting these challenges and combating this approach wil l require the concerted efforts of all instruments of U.S. national power. 1-20. IW is about people, not platforms. IW does not depend on military prowess alone. It also relies on the understanding of such social dynamics as tribal politics, social networks, religious influences, and cultural mores. Although IW is a violent struggle, not all participating irre gulars or irregular forces are necessarily armed. People, more so than weaponry, pl atforms, and advanced technology, will be the key to success in IW. Successful IW relies on building relationshi ps and partnerships at the local level. It takes patient, persistent, and culturally savvy people within the jo int force to execute IW. 1-21. Waging protracted IW depends on building global capability and capacity. IW will not be won by the United States alone but rather through combined effo rts with multinational partners. Combined IW will require the joint force to establish a long-term sust ained presence in numerous countries to build partner capability and capacity. This capability and capacity ex tends U.S. operational reach, multiplies forces available, and provides increased options for defeating adversaries. T he constituent activities of IW are— Insurgency. COIN. UW. Terrorism. CT. FID. Stability, security, transition, and reconstruction (SSTR) operations. Strategic communication (SC). PSYOP. Civil-military operations (CMO). Information operations (IO). Intelligence and counterintelligence (CI) activities. Transnational criminal activities, including narc o-trafficking, illicit arms dealing, and illegal financial transactions that support or sustain IW. Law enforcement activities focused on countering irregul ar adversaries. 1-22. The above list of operations and activities can be conducted wit hin IW; however, they are not new and most are addressed in current join t and Service doctrine. What is new is their application within the IW conceptual construct. The list of ac tivities considered together is also useful in characterizing how IW is distinct from conventional warfare and its emphasis on major combat operat ions (MCO). Particularly noteworthy is that UW (including support for insu rgencies), CT, FID, PSYOP, and CMO/CAO are ARSOF core tasks; thus, ARSOF are well-suited to be major practitioners of IW. 1-23. The working definition for conventional warfare provides an appropriate start ing point from which to contrast IW. The terms “conventional,” “regular,” and “traditional” warf are are essentially synonymous. Conventional warfare is focused on the direct milita ry confrontation between nation-states, in which the desired effect is to influence an adversary’s govern ment through the defeat of the adversary’s military. Moreover, conventional warfare attempts to isolate the population from c onflict and to minimize civilian interference (Figure 1-1, page 1-6). The definition agrees with the JP-1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, discussion of traditional warfare as a confrontation between nation-state s or coalitions/alliances of nation-states. The contrasting de finitions also agree with the Army’s understanding of MCO within the spectrum of conflict, and that MCO are distinct fr om IW (Figure 1-2, page 1-6)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 1-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Figure 1-1.

It also offers both complementary and competing ideas for ways and means to address strategic a nd operational challenges. The IW JOC addresses aspects of IW that other current JOCs do not: Theater strategy for IW. IW campaign design, planning, and execution. Global scale of IW operations. Joint Doctrine: (MCO JOC v.2.0, December 2006) Focused on seizing the initiative and dominating the adve rsary.

The MCO JOC includes a general description of IW that focuses on cases wh ere IW is integral to large-scale combat operations. The IW JOC provides a mo re robust discussion of IW, both in combination with conventional military operations and also as part of a protracte d regional or global IW campaign that may not include significant conventional military operations. 1-26. The SSTR JOC focuses on the full range of mili tary support across the continuum from peace to crisis and conflict to assist a state or region that is under severe stress. IW occurs primarily during crisis or conflict. In both IW and SSTR operations, a primary focus is on gaining the sup port of the population. In both concepts, the joint force normally plays an enabling role to t he efforts of other government agencies (OGAs) rather than a lead role. SSTR operations ar e a vital component of most IW operations and campaigns, but SSTR operations also occur outside the scope of IW. In some operat ions, IW may contrast with SSTR operations, such as supporting an insurgency or conducting UW where th e goal is not to support the host government but rather to undermine stability and security to erode an adve rsary’s control over its territory or population. As with IW, many SSTR ta sks are best performed by indigenous institutions, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations (NG Os), and OGAs. Nonetheless, both concepts envision the requirement for joint for ces to perform all tasks necessary to establish or maintain civil order when civilian agencies cannot do so. 1-27. Much of what the IW concept o ffers, however, aligns with traditi onal ARSOF doctrine, practice, and conceptualization. What makes IW different from c onventional warfare is the focus of its operations—a relevant population—and its strategic purpose to gain or mainta in control or influence over the population and to support that population through political, psychological, and economic m ethods. ARSOF practitioners of UW have long understood the importance of focusin g on the population and that a campaign’s logical lines of operation could include not only combat operation s but also information, intelligence, and developing capability. JP-1 states th at IW is marked by a struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and in fluence over the relevant populati on; that it primarily involves an indirect approach to erode power, influence, and will; and that it is determined by the characteristics of the adversary and is not, as such, a new or independent type of warfare. These are a ll familiar UW insights for ARSOF. 1-28. UW is a component and method of prosecuting IW , but UW and IW are each distinct. Both IW and UW focus on influencing relevant populations. However, whereas IW does no t necessarily require operations with irregular forces, UW is always conduct ed by, with, or through irregular forces.

The emerging IW concept borrows heavily from traditional ARSOF concepts, but they are not synonymous. Doctrinal Terms and Definitions Conventional or traditional warfare : A form of warfare between states that employs direct military confrontati on to defeat an adversary’s armed forces, destroy an adversary’s war-making capacity, or seize or retain territory in order to force a change in an adversary ’s government or policies. The focus of convent ional military operations is normally an adver sary’s armed forces with the objective of influencing the adversary’s government. It generally a ssumes that the indigenous populations within the operational area are nonbelliger ents and will accept whatever political outcome the belligerent governments impose, arbitrate, or negotiate. A fundamental military objective in conventional military operations is to minimize civilian interference in those operations. (IW JOC, V1.0) Irregular warfare : A violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for leg itimacy and influence over the relevant populations.

The different types of power with which intern ational players—chiefly sovereign nation-states— contend are all interconnected. This is one of the re asons it is difficult to separate them into distinct categories. It is also the single gr eatest reason that the ideas of UW, IW, COIN, and so on present such a challenge both conceptually and practically. Ever y time a serious commentator exhorts the need for interagency coordination to solve an international problem or calls fo r a “holistic” approach to its prosecution, it is this natural and man-made in terconnectedness of power to which he refers. 2-2. The instruments of national power as codified in U.S. policy and doctrine includ e DIME and DIMEFIL. The listing order of the identified instrume nts does not matter. This chapter and its supporting appendixes list the instruments in an order that allows for the sm oothest transition between interrelated concepts. This chapter addresses the military instrument last. Readers should refer to e ach supporting appendix (A through G) for a broad overview of the global environment in whic h each instrument of U.S. national power operates. INSTRUMENTS OF UNITED ST ATES NATIONAL POWER 2-3. The ability of the United States to achieve its national strate gic objectives depends in large measure on the effectiveness of the United States Government (USG) in employing the instruments of national power. The appropriate executive br anch officials, often with National Security Council (NSC) direction, normally coordinate these DIMEFIL instruments. The USG uses DIMEFIL instruments to apply its sources of power; power founded in human potential, economy, industry, science and tec hnology, academic institutions, geography, and national will. The Presiden t and the Secretary of De fense (SecDef) establish the rules for military power and integrate it with the other instrume nts of national power to advance and defend U.S. values, interests, and objectives. To accomplish this in tegratio n, the armed forces interact with the other responsible agencies to ensure mutual understanding of th e capabilities, limitations, and consequences of military and civilian actions and to identify the w ays in which military and nonmilitary capabilities best complement each other. D IPLOMATIC I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-4. The diplomatic instrument of national power is the principal instrument for en gaging with other states and foreign groups to advance U.S. values, in terests, and objectives. However, without the credible threat of force, diplomacy is inadeq uate against a determined adversary. Leaders of the U.S. armed forces have a responsibility to understand U.S. foreign policy and to assure that those responsible for U.S. diplomacy have a clear understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and consequences of military action. Role of Geographic Combatant Commanders 2-5. Geographic combatant commanders (GCCs) are responsible for integrating mil itary activities with diplomatic activities in their area of responsibility (AOR). The U.S. Ambassador and the corresponding Country Team are normally in charge of diplomatic -military activities in countries abroad. When directed by the President or SecDef, the GC C employs military forces in concert with the other instruments of national power. In these circumstances, the U.S. Ambassador and the Countr y Team may have complementary activities (employing the diplomatic instrumen t) that do not entail control of military forces, which remain under command authority of the GCC. (Appendix A includes f urther information on the diplomatic instrument of national power.)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 2-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Diplomatic Instrument of United States Na tional Power and Unconventional Warfare 2-6. The United States avoids resorting to military force, preferring to wield al l other instruments of power in the pursuit of national objectives and in the context of i nternational competition and conflict. Therefore, diplomacy routinely blocks the need for the application of the military instrument of power. However, when the President decides to employ the spec ific military application of UW, the Department of State (DOS) plays a crucial role. Regardless of whethe r the United States conducts the UW operation in support of resistance, insurgency, or conventional military operations, close coordination between ARSOF and DOS elements is re quired. For example— All UW missions involve diplomatic facilitation with foreign audiences , both external and indigenous to the UWOA. DOS channels may pr ove valuable for third-nation or surrogate support, and DOS liaison abilities may be the adhesive that allo ws diverse coalitions to persevere in a long-term effort. The sensitivity of missions involving covert and clandestine activities requires DOS elements to effect coordination of foreign support from friendly governments and the dipl omatic compliance or misdirection of adversary governments. The United States may conduct some ARSOF UW ope rations in states that are not belligerents. The U.S. Ambassador and his Country Team may in fact have complete or significant control over ARSOF inside the ambassador’s host coun try of responsibility. In such cases, the relationship between ARSOF conducting UW and the Country Team requires the be st possible coordination to be effective and appropriate. Even when UW is conducted in third-party stat es, much of the mission preparation and support may be conducted in or transit other states. Most states have U.S. diplomatic repres entation, and coordination with DOS personnel will be a key task for effective execution of UW operations. Like ARSOF, DOS personnel spend a majority of their careers in foreign count ries. Many DOS personnel have expert knowledge, cultural and la nguage abilities, current situational awareness, and a network of HN contacts at their disp osal. It is imperative that ARSOF access these valuable resources, when appropri ate, in the conduct of UW. I NFORMATIONAL I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-7. The informational instrument of national power has a diffuse and compl ex set of components with no single center of control. In the United States, individuals exchange information fr eely with minimal government control. Information itself is a strategic resource vital to n ational security. This reality applies to all instruments, entities, and activities of national pow er and extends to the armed forces at all levels. Military operations in particular are dependent upon many simultaneou s and integrated activities that, in turn, depend on information and information systems. Information and information-based technologies are vital elements throughout the spectrum of conflict. No rmally, the USG only imposes constraints on public access to USG information for national security and individual privacy reasons. Information readily available from multiple sources influences domestic a nd foreign audiences, includ ing citizens, adversaries, and governments. Role of the Media 2-8. It is important for the official agencies of government, including the armed forces, to recognize the fundamental role of the media as a conduit of information. The USG uses SC to provide top-down guidance for using the informational instrument of nationa l power through coordinated information, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the other instruments of national power. The armed forces support SC themes and messages through IO, public affairs (PA), and defense supp ort to public diplomacy (DSPD). The armed forces must assure media access consistent with classifica tion requirements, operations security, legal restrictions, and indi vidual privacy. The armed forces mu st also provide timely and accurate information to the public. Success in military operations depends on acquiring an d integrating essential information and denying it to the adversary. The armed forces are responsible fo r conducting IO, protecting what should not be disclosed, and aggressively attacking adversar y information systems. IO may involve complex legal and policy issues that require approva l, review, and coordination at the national level."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"United States National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 2-3 2-9. By definition, UW consists of operations conduct ed by, with, or through irregular forces. Such engagement with the “human terrain” is fundamenta lly a conflict of ideas. It is essential that ARSOF understand the informational environment within which forces execute UW a nd how informational instruments of power wielded by the United States and other actors can shape the hum an terrain. (Appendix B includes further details on the informational instrument of national po wer.) Informational Instrument of United States National Power and Unconventional Warfare 2-10. Informational power consists of both the universe of diffuse influences—most of which are beyond the control of the USG—shaping the international and domestic environments and USG-controlled specific instruments that can be deliberatel y employed against tailored target audiences (TAs) for specific ends. 2-11. For ARSOF practitioners of UW, the essential task with those influe nces that shape international and domestic environments is to understand the operationa l environment in its complex entirety and identify the sources of informational influence that contribute to th at complexity. This is a difficult undertaking because cultural worldviews and assumptions underlay the reception and interpre tation of ideas. A substitute does not exist for a persistent, detailed, and accurate understanding of the UW human terrai n in which ARSOF must operate. Most of this larger information environment will remain beyond USG control or influence. Therefore, the best that practitione rs of UW can achieve is to recogni ze the variety of information present within the human terrain of a UWOA , “navigate” along its conceptual c ontours, and leverage such cultural awareness to U.S. goals whenever possible. ARSOF UW is only partly a science; it is fundamentally an “art” of human interaction. 2-12. By contrast, USG-controlled specific instruments of informational power, wh ile narrower in scope, can achieve specific and measurable results useful to prosecuting UW. ARSOF can work with DOS counterparts to identify and engage select TAs that are able to influence behavior within a UWOA. Such TAs may be inside the UWOA itself or outside but able to influence the U WOA. The USG can then subject these TAs, directly or indirectly, to a DOS public diplomacy (PD) campaign coordi nated to support the UW effort. Similarly, since UW may be a long-duration or politically sensitive effort, ARSOF and its DOS partner, the Bureau of Public Affa irs, can craft a PA campaign intended to keep the U.S. domestic audience informed of the truth in a manner supportive of USG goals and the effec tive prosecution of UW. 2-13. In both the foreign and domestic arenas, ARSOF UW planners should continuously monitor adversary attempts to deliberately mislead foreig n and domestic audiences. Planners must employ responsive friendly information foreign adversaries to counteract foreign mi sinformation. Domestically, “misinformation” is a politically contentious concept. ARSOF UW planners must work closely with IO and legal professionals to identify domestic misinformation and pr ovide evidence of such attempts to joint task force (JTF) commanders charged with prosecuting a UW campaign. Senior ARSOF leaders must then keep the Department of Defense (DOD) and other civilian leadership informed as a DSPD responsibility. 2-14. PSYOP are one of the core tasks of ARSOF and a component discipline of UW. In some cases, an entire ARSOF UW effort may involve only PSYOP forces and may never include t he employment of SF or Civil Affairs (CA) forces. This is an acknowledgeme nt of the power and centrality of ideas in warfare, including UW. Regardless of the scale or degree of ARSOF commitment in a UW effort, PSYOP are an initial and continuous, integral, and fundam entally central activity of ARSOF UW. I NTELLIGENCE I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-15. Intelligence, as an instrument of national power, provides the na tional leadership with the information needed to realize national goals and obje ctives while providing military leadership with the information needed to accomplish missions and implement the national security stra tegy (NSS). Planners use intelligence to identify the adversary’s capabilities an d centers of gravity, project probable courses of action (COAs), and assist in planning friendly force employment. Intelligence also provides assessments that help the joint force commander (JFC) decide which forces to deploy; when, how, and where to de ploy them; and how to employ them in a manner that accomplishes the mission at the lowest human and political cost. 2-16. The traditional “DIME” construct of national power incorporated intelligence into the informational instrument. This was appropriate because all intelligence is a form of in formation. In the post-9/11 world, however, the DIMEFIL construct sepa rates the two into related but distinct instruments.” Informational"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 2-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 power conveys themes to selected TAs whether or not the USG deliberately focuses or even controls those themes. Intelligence as a national instrument of powe r is a more specific tool with a deliberate focus controlled by the USG. Whereas in formational power projects informa tion to shape an environment, intelligence seeks to gather information to understand the environ ment and inform USG decision making. The USG usually crafts intelligence to answer specific questi ons. Interagency Intelligence Process 2-17. Intelligence supports joint operations by provid ing critical information and finished intelligence products to the combatant command (COCOM), th e subordinate service and functional component commands, and subordinate joint forces. Commanders at all levels depend on timely, accurate information and intelligence on an adversary’s dispositions, stra tegies, tactics, intents, objectives, strengths, weaknesses, values, capabilities, an d critical vulnerabilities. The intelligence process is comprise d of a wide variety of interrelated intelligence operations. These intell igence operations (planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, dissemina tion and integration, and evaluation and feedback) must focus on the commander’s mission and concept of operations (Figure 2-1). Figure 2-1. The intelligence process 2-18. The intelligence process describes how the various types of intelligence operations interact to meet the commander’s intelligence needs. The intelligence process pro vides a useful model that, albeit simplistic, nevertheless facilitates understanding the wi de variety of intelligence operations and their interrelationships. There are no firm boundaries outlining where each operation within the modern intelligence process begins or ends. Intelligence oper ations are not sequential; rather, they are nearly simultaneous. In addition, not all ope rations necessarily continue through out the entire intelligence process. 2-19. The increased tempo of military operations requir es an unimpeded flow of automatically processed and exploited data that is both timely and relevant to the commander’s needs. This unanalyzed combat information must be simultaneously available to both the commander (for tim e-critical decision making) and to the intelligence analyst (for the production of current intelligence assessments). 2-20. Examples of uses for such unanalyzed combat information include, but are not limit ed to, time-sensitive targeting, personnel recovery opera tions, and threat warning alerts. Likewise, those Planning and Direction Collection Processing and Exploitation Analysis and Production Dissemination and Integration Evaluation and Feedback Mission/Concept of Operations"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"United States National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 2-5 conducting the analysis, production, and dissemination of intelligence products must do so in time to support the commander’s decision-making needs. 2-21. Joint intelligence operations begin with the identifi cation of a need for intelligence regarding all relevant aspects of the operational environment, esp ecially the adversary. The commander and all joint force staff elements identify these intelligence needs, and the J-2 formalizes these needs as intelligence requirements early in the planning process. The commander identifies those critical pieces of intelligence that he must know by a particular time to plan and execute a successful mission as his priority intelligence requirements (PIRs). Commanders identify PIRs at ev ery level and base them on guidance obtained from the mission statement, the commander’s in tent, and the end-state objectives. 2-22. Intelligence requirements are the basis for current and future intelligence operations and are prioritized based on consumer inputs during the pla nning and direction portion of the intelligence process. The J-2 provides the focus and direction for collecti on requirements to support the COCOM or subordinate joint force. 2-23. The collection portion of the intelligence process in volves tasking appropriate collection assets and resources to acquire the data and information required to satisfy collection objectives. Collection includes the identification, coordination, and positioning of a ssets and resources to satisfy collection objectives. 2-24. Once the data that might satisfy the requireme nt is collected, it undergoes processing and exploitation. Processing and exploitation transforms the collected raw data into information that intelligence analysts can use to produce and dissemina te multidiscipline intelligence products. Relevant, critical information should also be disseminated to the command er and joint force staff to facilitate time-sensitive decision making. Processing and exploitation ti me varies depending on the characteristics of specific collection assets. For example, some intelligence, surv eillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems accomplish processing and exploitation automatically and nearly simultaneously with collection, while other collection assets, such as human intelligence (HUM INT) teams, may require substantially more time. Personnel prioritize and synchronize processing and exploitation require ments with the commander’s PIRs. 2-25. The analysis and production portion of the inte lligence process involves integrating, evaluating, analyzing, and interpreting information from single or multiple source s into a finished intelligence product. The demands of the modern operational environment require intelli gence products that anticipate the needs of the commander and are timely, accurate, usable , complete, relevant, objective, and available. 2-26. Personnel disseminate intelligence products to the re quester, who integrates the intelligence into the decision-making and planning processes. In the case of threat warning alerts essential to the preservation of life or vital resources, such information must be immediately communicated directly to those forces, platforms, or personnel identified at risk so the appropriate responsive action c an be taken once such notification has been acknowledged. 2-27. Evaluation of intelligence operations, activities, and products is continuous. Based on these evaluations and the resulting feedback, remedial actions should be ini tiated, as required, to improve the performance of intelligence operations and the overall functioning of the intelligence process. (Appendix C contains further information on the intelligence instrument of national power.) Intelligence Instrument of United States Na tional Power and Unconventional Warfare 2-28. Good intelligence is central to good decision ma king by national leaders throughout the spectrum of conflict. When the USG employs ARSOF in UW, good intelligence is likewise a prerequisite for its effective prosecution. Just as ARSOF must understand the informati on environment that shapes the human terrain in a UWOA, commanders prosecuting UW must receive timely and accurate intell igence on specific, pertinent as pects of the UWOA. 2-29. UW is conducted by, with, or through irregular forces. Knowledge of the values, motivations, capabilities, and limitations of such populations is usually difficult to acquire and even more difficult to accurately assess. Typically, ARSOF UW elements will be introduced to resistance or insurgent forces by OGAs—usually a USG intelligence agency. Such intelligence prepa ration will normally be the result of discrete and persistent efforts over many years. It is clear that effective intelligence preparation must"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 2-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 precede ARSOF UW efforts. Ther efore, ARSOF cultivate a close working relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies. 2-30. Forces predominately conduct UW—directly or in directly—in hostile, nonpermissive, or denied territory. Such operations are both physically and often politically hi gh-risk activities. Small U.S. units and their surrogates operating in denied territory are usually beyond the rea ch of most friendly support. The margin for error in such conditions is very small. Good intelligence pr eparation before deployment and continuously updated, accurate, and timely intelligence during employ ment are critical. 2-31. The purpose of UW is to support resistance, insurgency, or conventional mil itary operations. Political control and legitimacy of regimes are the issues. Therefore, UW has s trategic utility that can alter the balance of power between sovereign states. Such high stakes carry the high est political risk in both the international and domestic political arenas and nece ssarily require sensitive ex ecution. The necessity to operate with clandestine and covert means and sometimes a varying mix of cla ndestine and covert ways and ends places a premium on excellent intelligence of the UWOA. As in all conf lict scenarios short of large-scale, state-to-state warfare, the DOS, inte lligence providers, and ARSOF must closely coordinate their activities to enable and safeguard sensitive UW operation s. 2-32. Finally, when the USG employs UW in support of conventional military ope rations, the end state of friendly conventional victory is typically overt. Intellig ence requirements of conventional forces will focus on traditional warfighting information, such as enem y order of battle, adversary state infrastructure, or terrain and weather. Consideration of human factors is secondary. Human factor s are primarily addressed for how they may affect the progress of conventional operations. Despite the UW role of ARSOF in support of a conventional main effort in this case, th e intelligence requirements of the UW operation itself remain specialized; they necessarily focus on the human terrain. Int elligence providers and conventional force JTF commanders must understand the differing requirements of intellige nce for MCO and UW. E CONOMIC I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-33. Governmental agencies only partially control the economic instrument of na tional power. In keeping with U.S. values and constitutional imperatives, in dividuals and entities have broad freedom of action worldwide. The responsibility of the USG lies w ith facilitating the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services worldwide that promote U.S. fundamental objectives, such as promoting general welfare and supporting security interests and objectives. Role of the United States Economy 2-34. A strong U.S. economy with free a ccess to global markets and resources is a fundamental engine of the general welfare, the guarantor of a strong national defense, and an influe nce for economic expansion by U.S. trade partners worldwide. The armed forces mu st coordinate with USG agencies responsible for employing the economic instrument to facilitate unified acti on. The NSC has primary responsibility for the integration of the economic and military instruments of national power abroa d. (Appendix D contains further information on the economic instrument of national power.) Economic Instrument of United States National Power and Unconventional Warfare 2-35. Economic intercourse, great and small, is a natural human activity a nd—along with information exchange and the spectrum of conflict—is a timeless characteristic of the international environment. Nation-states, human groups, and individuals all respond to economic act ivity. Most such exchange is unmanaged, routine, and peaceful. However, entities can use economic inputs and flows as a “weapon” in times of conflict up to and including large-scale gene ral war. ARSOF understand that properly integrated manipulation of economic power can and should be a component of UW. 2-36. The United States can use managed access to U.S. economic inputs to leverage t he policies and cooperation of state gov ernments. Economic incentive and disinc entives—real, implied, or simply identified—can build and sustain international coa litions waging or supporting U.S. UW campaigns. As part of an interagency effort, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) can recomme nd changes to U.S. policy that can provide such incentives to state government s and others at the national strategic policy level."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"United States National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 2-7 2-37. If properly authorized and coordinated, ARSOF can use measured and focused economic incentives and disincentives to persuade advers aries, allies, and surrogates to m odify their behavior at the theater strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Such application of economic powe r must be part of a circumspect, integrated, and consistent UW plan. 2-38. Like all other instruments of U.S. national power, the use and effects of ec onomic “weapons” are interrelated and they must be coordinated carefully. Once again, ARSOF must work carefully with the DOS and intelligence community (IC) to determine which elements of the huma n terrain in the UWOA are most susceptible to economic engagement and what second- and third-or der effects are likely from such engagement. The United States Agency for Internatio nal Development’s (USAID’s ) placement abroad and its mission to engage human groups provide one channel for leveraging ec onomic incentives. The DOC’s can similarly leverage its routine influence with U.S. corporations active abroad. Moreover, the IO effects of economic promises kept (or ignored) can prove critical to the legitimacy of U .S. UW efforts. UW practitioners must plan for these effects. 2-39. CA units in ARSOF are the natural lead planners for focusing JTF comma nders’ planning on the use of the economic weapon in UW. AR SOF understand the importance of no t assuming that CMO in UW are somehow an adjunct to the “real fight.” The role of CA in wielding the economic weapon is an important element in ARSOF UW operations. F INANCIAL I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-40. The financial instrument of national power promotes the conditio ns for prosperity and stability in the United States and encourages prospe rity and stability in the rest of the world. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is the primary federal agency re sponsible for the economic and financial prosperity and security of the United States and as such is responsible for a wide range of activities, including advising the President on economic and financial issues, promoting the Preside nt’s growth agenda, and enhancing corporate governance in financial instituti ons. In the international arena, the Treasury works with other federal agencies, the governments of other nations, and the international financial institutions to encourage economic growth; raise standards of living; and predict and prevent, to the extent possible, economic and financial crises. International Financial System 2-41. The functions attached to any good or token that operate in trade as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account commonly defines money. In common usage, money refers more specifically to currency, particularly the many circul ating currencies with legal tender st atus conferred by a national state. More recently, deposit accounts denominated in such currencies are also considered part of the money supply. Money may also serve as a means of rati oning access to scarce resources and as a quantitative measure that provides a common standard for the comp arison and valuation of both quality and quantity of goods and services. 2-42. The use of money provides an eas ier alternative to the ancient t echnique of barter, which, in a modern, complex economy, is inefficient because it requires a coincidence of wants bet ween traders and an agreement that these needs are of equal value before a transaction can occur. The use of money creates efficiency gains that encourage trad e and the division of labor, which in turn increases productivity and wealth. 2-43. Like language, money is a social organization and civilizing force that provides a means and incentive for human beings to relate to one another economically by ex changing goods and services for mutual benefit. The capacity to convert perishable commodities and nonstorable human labor into money provides a powerful incentive for people to produce more than they need for present personal consumption and to convert the surplus value into money so that it can be stored t o meet future needs. Thus, the invention of money has stimulated the development of society by fostering hard work, higher pr oductivity, and continuous innovation.

Although finance is generally an operation of real and virtua l currency, anything that can serve as a “medium of exchange” provides those who accept th e medium with a method of financia l transaction. For both reasons, ARSOF understand that they can and should exploit the active and an alytical capabilities existing in the financial instrument of U.S. power in the conduct of UW. 2-45. Like the economic activity, which all nation-states, human groups, and indi viduals respond to, ARSOF can use financial power as a weapon in times of conflict up to and including large-scale general war. Like the economic activity that it is related to, most financia l power is unmanaged, routine, and peaceful. However, manipulation of U. S. financial strength can leverage the policies and cooperation of state governments. Financial incentiv es and disincentives can build and sustain international coalitions waging or supporting U.S. UW campaigns. As part of an interagency effort, the U.S . Treasury can recommend changes to U.S. policy that can provide such incentives to st ate governments and others at the national strategic policy level. Participation in international fi nancial organizations, such as the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organization for Economic Coope ration and Development (OECD), and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), offers the U.S. diplomat ic-financial venues to accomplish such coalitions. 2-46. State manipulation of tax and interest rates and other legal and bureaucratic measures can apply unilateral U.S. financial action to open, modify, or close financial flows. Gove rnment can apply unilateral and indirect financial power through persuasive influence to international and domestic financial institutions regarding availability and terms of loans, grant s, or other financial assistance to foreign state and nonstate actors. 2-47. If properly authorized and coordinated, ARSOF can use—or coordinate for other agenc ies to use— measured and focused financial incentives or disincentives to persuade adversaries, allies, and surrogates to modify their behavior at the theater strategic, operational, and tacti cal levels. Such application of financial power must be part of a circumspect, integrated, and consistent UW plan. 2-48. Like all other instruments of U.S. national power, the use and effects of fi nancial weapons are interrelated and they must be coordinated carefully. Once again, ARSO F must work with the DOS and IC to determine which elements of the human terrain in the UWOA are m ost susceptible to financial engagement and what second- and third-order eff ects are likely from such engagement. The Treasury’s Office of International Affairs and Office of Te rrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) (and its components), together with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fi nCEN), provide financially mission-focused channels for identifying opportunities to employ the financial weapon. In addition to intelligence and policy changes that may provide active incentive or disincentive leverage, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has a long history of conducting ec onomic warfare valuable to any ARSOF UW campaign. L AW E NFORCEMENT I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-49. Through the law enforcement instru ment of national power, the USG is accountable to its people and can govern its territory effectively. Th e USG has the capability and capacity to— Enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law. Ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic. Provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime. Seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior. Ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans. 2-50. As globalization increases world integration, the scop e of threats to U.S. security and public safety becomes more global. The law enfor cement instrument increasingly and n ecessarily works outside of U.S. borders to combat these threats."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"United States National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 2-9 International Law Enforcement Environment 2-51. Most nation-states have some means of enforcing national and subordin ate law. The quality and effectiveness of state law enforcem ent instruments vary greatly, however, and represent a paradox. In liberal democracies, citizens enjoy enforcement entities bound by legal guarantees of citizen rights and due process under the rule of deliberative law. Howeve r, the very liberty prot ected by such safeguards sometimes frustrates crime and terror prevention because common and political criminals use that relative freedom to perpetrate crimes. By contrast, people su bject to dictatorial regimes are likely to suffer too much law enforcement because cruel and severe entities of state internal security limit individual freedom. With less liberty, criminals experience more difficulty in achieving their ends. 2-52. At a minimum, all governments oppose threats to their existence. However, the apparatus of government represents only a small portion of a citizenry and directly controls only a s mall portion of its subject territory. Regardless of its desire to do so, no government can control eve rything within its jurisdiction or prevent all violations of law all of the tim e. The attitude of the population, degree of control provided by competing (nonstate gove rnment) enforcers of law, and tr aditions of civic order—or lack thereof—are key components of the ov erall law enforcement environment. All of these varying conditions will contribute to the degree of lawlessness in an y given society. These conditions and the political willingness of other states to cooperat e in such efforts affects the ability of the United States to use the law enforcement instrument of power abroad. (Appendix F includes further information o n the law enforcement instrument of national power.) Law Enforcement Instrument of United States National Power and Unconventional Warfare 2-53. ARSOF recognize several similarities of law en forcement activities with military operations and potentially useful applications of the law enforcemen t instrument of U.S. power to the conduct of UW. Although UW is not a direct task for law enforcement, nonmilitary law enforcement agencies conduct routine operations that parallel or support other ARSOF operations. Such agen cies may also play a supporting role in an ARSOF UW effort. 2-54. For example, reasonable opinions continue to diff er whether a long-term CT effort is essentially a military or law enforcement challenge. One reason this issue remains c ontentious is that many of the activities required to successfully conduc t CT are identical, regardless of wh ich institutions are tasked to do them. CT requires excellent intelligence, painstaking attention to de tail in assessing human terrain, sharply focused target discrimination, sensitivity to deadly threats, a nd a persistent USG presence abroad for effective target surveillance, information sharing, and combined ope rations with allied partners. Terrorist adversaries also seek to avoid the scrutiny of all government entiti es that seek them out. 2-55. The conduct of UW requires similar activities. E ffective UW is based on intelligence involving a painstaking attention to detail in assessing human terrain a nd sharply focusing on target discrimination. U.S. law enforcement agencies rou tinely and necessarily conduct and share such intellig ence with their foreign counterparts and the U.S. IC. Some friendly and adversary actors in th e UWOA may be persons or groups of interest to U.S. law en forcement agencies. Within the boundaries of by law, ARSOF understand the importance of coordinating law enforcement intellig ence efforts and data sharing with UW planning and operations. 2-56. Actors engaged in supporting elements in the UWOA may rely on criminal activities, such as smuggling, narcotics, or human trafficking. Political and military adversaries in the UWOA will exhibit the same sensitivity to official exposure and engagement because criminal entities routinely seek to avoid law enforcement. Sometimes, political and military adversar ies are simultaneously criminal adversaries, which ARSOF UW planners must consider a threat. At other times, the methods and networks of real or perceived criminal entities can be useful as supporting elements of a U.S.-sponsored UW effort. In either case, ARSOF understand the importance of coordinating military intellig ence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) for specific UW campaigns with the routine intellig ence activities conducted by U.S. law enforcement agencies."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 2-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 M ILITARY I NSTRUMENT OF N ATIONAL P OWER 2-57. In wielding the military instrument of national po wer, the armed forces must ensure their adherence to U.S. values, constitutional principles, and standards for the profession of arms. While responsibility for wielding the other instruments of power rests outside the military establishment, U.S. military leaders are responsible for providing th e advice and recommendations necessary fo r the overall U.S. effort to properly incorporate the military instrument with the other in struments of national power. Unified action within the military instrument supports the national strategic unity of ef fort through close coordination with the other instruments of national power. International Security Environment 2-58. Sovereign nation-states, each of which pursues what it perceives to be in its national interest, is traditionally the focus in the modern era. Where those in terests come into conflict, nation-states use all of the instruments of national power at their disposal in the attemp t to resolve conflicts in their favor. 2-59. Occasionally, nation-states employ the military instrument when co nflicting interests are otherwise irreconcilable by other means. This use of the military instrument may range from peaceful use of military assets in support of other instruments of national power through the c ommitment of massive military power in global total war. Instruments of United States Military Power 2-60. The U.S. military, officially known as the U.S. armed forces, consists of five uniformed branches, the United States Army (USA), United States Navy (U SN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Coas t Guard (USCG). These branches are under civilian control, with the U.S. President se rving as commander in chief. All bran ches except the USCG are part of the DOD, which is under the authority of the SecDef , who is also a civilian. The USCG falls under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). During wartime, the SecDef may place the USCG under the DOD in the Department of the Navy (DN). 2-61. The USA, USN, and USAF are the pr imary instruments of U.S. military power on land, on sea, and in aerospace respectively. The USMC is a specialized land power, with a traditional fo cus on projecting land power from the sea. The USCG is a specialized sea power, with a traditional focus on enforcing maritime law and defense of U.S. shore areas. The U.S. armed forces have global responsibilities and are routinely stationed or deployed throughout the world. Although the primary function of the armed services is warfighting, much of U.S. mili tary capability is necessarily involve d in logistics and transportation, which enable rapid buildup of forces as needed. The US AF maintains a large fleet of combat, transportation and aerial refueling aircraft. The USMC maintains Ma rine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) at sea with the USN’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. Th e USN’s fleet of active aircraft ca rriers, combined with a military doctrine of power projection, enables a flexible respon se to potential threats. Traditionally, the USA has not been used as much as the USMC as an expeditionary force. However, the USA is reorganizing its active-duty units into brigade combat teams with an emphasis on rapid power projection. These are some of the reasons that the U.S. military is universally c onsidered the most powerful in the world. (Appendix G includes further information on the military instrument of national power.) Military Instrument of United States National Power and Unconventional Warfare 2-62. The U.S. armed forces excel at conducting conventional warfare; most observers would admit that they are the most powerful and successful conventiona l armed forces in human history. However, UW is not an enterprise rooted in the direct application of missiles, air wings, naval fleets, and combat brigades. Most assets of the military instrument of U.S. national power are inappropriate—even counterproductive— to UW. The strengths of conventional forces (seizing terrain, destroying property, and winning battles against other conventional armed forces) are largely irrelevant and seldom effecti ve in a UW effort. UW is a fundamentally indirect application of power that leverages human groups to act in concert with U.S. national objectives. Persuading human actors requires specially trained personnel and techniques to act on the full range of human motivation beyond mere narrowly defined actual or threatened physical coercion."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"United States National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 2-11 2-63. ARSOF UW operations are specialized (military) ope rations. However, even some military special operations forces (SOF) assets are inappropriate and counterproductive to effective UW. Regardless of the specialized capabilities of some other elite units, the pr imary military assets for conducting UW reside in SF, PSYOP, and CA units of ARSOF. Similarly, AR SOF UW operations are inherently joint operations, and UWOAs are JSOAs. However, the inherently political nature, typically protracted time frame, usually discreet execution, and expected involvement of no n-DOD interagency and multinational partners in UW conceptually set the UWOA apart from all other JSOAs. UW operati ons are unique military operations in which most USG involvement may be outside direct military control. Finally, and by contrast, the application of all USG DIMEFIL instruments in the mo st effective conduct of UW is the ideal. By the nature of UW, ARSOF Soldiers may often find themselves the sole USG repr esentative in their assigned sector of a UWOA. At those times and places, USG effo rts will be “integrated” in the creative and flexible ARSOF warrior. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTE GRATED NATIONAL POWER 2-64. The supporting appendixes for this chapter (Appendixes A through G) provi de a broader treatment of the global environment within which each U.S. instrument of national po wer is employed. While unusual in scope for an FM, this explanatory technique is both appropriate and neces sary. UW is difficult to conceptualize and even more difficult to effectively execute, because it does not easily conform to simple definitions, narrowly conceived and separated bureaucr atic responsibilities, or direct and simplistic application of brute power. 2-65. The military strength of a 12-man Special Forces operational detachment A (SFODA) in direct combat with enemy infantry is slight. However, th e ability of that same SFODA—properly employed in UW—to persuade other human actors to conduct activitie s in concert with U.S. national objectives can have strategic consequences. UW permits the leveraging of actors to conduct operations beyond the normal range of direct U.S. power. It permits a relatively small (but focused) U.S. investment to multiply effects i n the UWOA thereby indirectly multiplying such U.S. power. The ways in which ARSOF achieve these effects are based on the range of possible human motivations. Therefore, A RSOF must consider and plan for all media of human interaction, and the most e ffective ARSOF UW operati on will integrate all U.S. instruments to achieve the desired end state. 2-66. All carefully planned UW operations require timely and accurate intelligence. ARSOF must properly understand the human terrain to effectively negotiate the currents of hum an interaction. The U.S. IC is obviously chartered to gather such information. However, every instrument of U.S. national power likewise requires access to timely and accurate information for its own effectiveness. ARSOF understand the necessity of tapping into the data that all other agencies routin ely acquire and use such information in the conduct of UW. For example, ARSOF must exploit the inherent expertise of the DOS in understanding foreign environments and audiences before and during the prosecution of a UW effo rt. The routine foreign presence of other agencies, such as the Drug Enfo rcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or commercial sections of the DO C, can each provide valuable insights into the human terrain and motivations of the UWOA. 2-67. ARSOF do not use information solely for understanding. The manipulation of information can be an effective weapon that can shape TAs’ perceptions. The calculated and integrated use of specific mes sages is a component of ARSOF attempts to persuade or dissuade certain behaviors i n the context of a UW campaign. PSYOP units are specifica lly designed to execute such ef forts. However, the variety of information capable of affecting human perception is enormous; only a tiny percentage of such information sources resides within the military’s direct ability to wield. The activities of all U.S. instruments of national power carry informational messages (intended and unintended). ARSOF UW planners must work with their interagency partners to improve the messages that each U.S. activity carries. The most effective information plan for a UW campaign will attempt to ensure that the c orrect message is delivered to—and perceived by—the correct TA, as inte nded, at the right time, and in the context of an integrated plan of desired effects. The value of an integrated coordination of themes and products of t he DOS’s Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP), the federal agency International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), and military PSYOP units in the conduct of UW is obvious. However, othe r nonintuitive media of information have significant military importance. For example, U.S. economic a nd financial promises made and kept"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 2-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 (or ignored), the perception of justice (or injustice or ineffectiveness ) of U.S. or allied law enforcement, or the inherent cultural values carried by non-USG-controlled popular cult ure have the ability to shape the attitudes and behaviors of human groups in the UWOA. 2-68. The application of economic or financial incentives is among the most powerful ideas in the U.S. arsenal of power. Although some U.S. adversaries ar e irreconcilable to accommodation with U.S. interests and must be engaged in other ways, many declared or potential adversaries can be persua ded or dissuaded by economic or financial means to become declared or potential allies (or at least neutralized). CA units are specifically designed, in part, to create desired effects from the manipulation o f material inputs in their assigned area of operations (AO). Like the information environment, varied economic in tercourse is a universal and mostly unmanaged human activity. However, the abil ity of the USG to affect the economic environment is enormous, and it has economic weapons at its disposal. ARSOF UW pl anners must carefully coordinate the introduction and withholdi ng of economic and financial assets into the UWOA with their interagency partners. For example, direct application of USAID gra nts to specific human groups can alter negative behaviors or cement positive aff iliations. The direct activitie s of the DOC’s U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service to promote export expansion for U.S. and other mu ltinational corporations (MNCs) can have similar (albeit indirect) effects. At the highest leve ls of diplomatic and financial interaction, the USG’s ability to influence internati onal financial institutions—with corresponding effects to exchange rates, interest rates, credit ava ilability, and money supplies—can cement multinational coalitions for UW campaigns or dissuade adversar y nation-state governments from supporting specific actors in the UWOA. 2-69. The ability of the United States to achieve its national strate gic objectives depends in large measure on the effectiveness of the USG in employing the instruments of national power in a coordinated manner. All competition and conflict between states and other states (or nonstate actors) reflect a mix of the DIMEFIL instruments. UW, as one sp ecific military operation, conducted by a few specially dedicated (primarily ARSOF) units within the military instrument, is not exempt from this truth. UW is fundamentally about influencing human groups within a specific area (usually beyond the reach of unilateral U.S. military power). Every means of influencing human behavior a pplies to UW. 2-70. It is the responsibility of the President and the S ecDef to establish the rules for and integration of military power with the other instruments of national power. To acc omplish this integration, the armed forces interact with the other responsible agencies to ensure mutual understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and consequences of military and civilian actions a nd to identify the ways in which military and nonmilitary capabilities can best complement each othe r. ARSOF understand that the most effective UW effort will coordinate all instruments of U.S. nationa l power into an integrated and circumspect whole. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-1 Chapter 3 Policy and Doctrine NATIONAL POLICY 3-1. The President and his NSC ultimately determin e authoritative U.S. UW policy. Further, the departments and institutions of the USG executive branch de velop UW policy into doctrine and implement it. The legislative and judicial branches of the USG bot h support and constrain U.S. policy. In addition, the U.S. democratic system provides for an orderly transfer of power between indivi duals and parties on a routine basis. One strength of this system is that it allows for changes of policy direction that reflect changing U.S. understanding of the international environment. H owever, since the conduct of UW typically requires long-term effort, relatively short-term changes of administration a nd changes in the makeup of legislative and judicial bodies can result in policy chan ges that frustrate consistent and persistent effort. Moreover, changes in the international environment and internationa l law can affect such policy. National-level strategies applicable to UW ar e therefore necessarily a snapshot in time. N ATIONAL S ECURITY S TRATEGY OF THE U NITED S TATES (2006) 3-2. It is the policy of the United States to seek a nd support democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of endi ng tyranny in the world. The fundamental character of regimes is as important as the distribution of power among them. The goal of U .S. statecraft is to help create a world of democratic, well-governed states that can meet citizens’ needs an d act responsibly in the international system. This is the best way to provide enduring sec urity for the American people. 3-3. Achieving this goal is the work of generations. The United States is in the early years of a long struggle, similar to what the country faced in the early years of the Cold War. In the 20th century, freedom triumphed over the threats of fascism and communism . Yet a new totalitarian ideology now threatens—an ideology grounded not in secular philosophy but in the perversion of a relig ion. Its content may be different from the ideologies of the last century, but its means are similar: intolerance, mu rder, terror, enslavement, and repression. As in the past, today the United States must lay the founda tions and build the institutions that the country needs to meet these cha llenges. Therefore, th e United States must— Champion aspirations for human dignity. Strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent at tacks against the United States and its allies. Work with others to defuse regional conflicts. Prevent enemies from threatening the United States and its allies w ith weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade . Expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrast ructure of democracy.

The DOD gives top priority to dissuading, deterring, and defeating those who seek to harm the United States directly, especially extremist enemies with WMD. Secure strategic access and retain global freedom of action . The DOD will promote security, prosperity, and freedom of action of the United St ates and its partners by securing access to key regions, lines of communication, and the global commons.

The DOD will help partners increase their capacity to defend themselves and collectively meet challenges t o interests in common with those of the United States. Establish favorable security conditions . Working with others in the USG, the DOD will create conditions for a favorable international system by honoring U.S. security commitments and working with other nations to bring about a common appreciation of threats ; a broad, secure, and lasting peace; and the steps required to protect against these threats. The DOD will accomplish these objectives with the following activities: By assuring allies and friends . The DOD will provide assurance by demonstrating U.S. resolve to fulfill alliance and other defense commitments and help protect common interests. By dissuading potential adversaries . The DOD will work to dissuade potential adversaries from adopting threatening capabilities, methods, and ambitions, pa rticularly by developing key U.S. military advantages. By deterring aggression and countering coercion . The DOD will deter aggression and counter coercion by maintaining capable and rapidly deployable military fo rces and, when necessary, demonstrating the will to resolve conflicts decisive ly on favorable terms. By defeating adversaries . At the direction of the President, the DOD will defeat adversaries at the time, place, and in the manner of U.S. choosi ng, setting the conditions for future security. 3-5. The four NDS guidelines that structure DOD strategic planning and decisi on making are— Conducting active, layered defense . The DOD will focus military planning, posture, operations, and capabilities on the active, forward, and layered defense of the United States, its interests, and its partners. Conducting continuous transformation . The DOD will continually adapt how it approaches and confronts challenges, conducts business, and works with others. Conducting a capabilities-based approach . The DOD will operationalize the NDS to address mature and emerging challenges by se tting priorities among competing capabilities. Managing risks . The DOD will consider the full range of risks associated with re sources and operations and manage clear trade-offs across the department. N ATIONAL M ILITARY S TRATEGY OF THE U NITED S TATES (2004) 3-6. The military challenge is to stay the course in the WOT while transformi ng the armed forces to conduct future joint operations. To meet this challeng e, the armed forces will continue to focus on three priorities: winning the WOT, enhancing joint warfight ing, and transforming for the future. The national military strategy (NMS) provides focus for military activities by defi ning a set of interrelated military objectives from which the Service chiefs and comb atant commanders (CCDRs) identify desired capabilities and against which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) assesses risk. Military Objectives 3-7. The NMS establishes three military objectives that support the ND S. These are to— Protect the United States against external attacks and aggression. Prevent conflict and surprise attack. Prevail against adversaries."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-3 Joint Vision for Future Warfighting 3-8. Sustaining and increasing the qualitative military advantages the United States enjoys today will require transformation—a transformation achieved by combining technological, intellectual, and cultural changes across the joint community. The goal is full-spectrum domina nce—the ability to control any situation or defeat any adversary across the range of military operations. 3-9. The United States faces a number of dangerous a nd pervasive threats. Traditional, irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive challenges will require the armed forces to adjust quickly and decisively to change and anticipate emerging threats: States employing recognized military capabilitie s and forces in well-understood forms of military competition and conflict pose traditional challenges. States employing unconventiona l methods to counter the trad itional advantages of stronger opponents pose irregular challenges. Adversaries acquiring, possessing, and using WMD or methods producing WMD-l ike effects pose catastrophic challenges. Adversaries developing and using breakthrough technologies to negate c urrent U.S. advantages in key operational domains pose disruptive challenges. 3-10. Three key aspects of the security environment have unique implication s for executing this military strategy. These aspects will drive the development of concepts and capabilities that ensure success in future operations: A wider range of adversaries. A more complex and distributed operational environment. An increase in technolo gy diffusion and access. A Wider Range of Adversaries 3-11. The range of adversaries capable of threatening the United States, its allies, and its interests include states, nonstate organizations, and individuals. Some states with tradi tional military forces and advanced systems, including cruise and ballistic missiles, could seek to control key regions of the world. A few of these states are “rogues” that violate treaties, secr etly pursue and proliferate WMD, reject peaceful resolution of disputes, and display callous disregard for their citizens. Some of these states sponsor terrorists, providing them financial su pport, sanctuary, and access to dange rous capabilities. Some nonstate actors, such as terrorist networks, international cr iminal organizations, and illegal arme d groups, menace stability and security. Even some individuals may have the mea ns and will to disrupt international order. Some of these adversaries are not politically constrai ned. This makes these adversaries, particularly nonstate actors, less susceptible to traditional means of deterrence. Adversaries are increasingly seeking asymmetric capabilities and are using them in innovative ways. The y avoid U.S. strengths, such as precision strikes, and seek to counter U.S. power projection capabilities by creating antiaccess environments. Such adversaries will target civilian populations, econ omic centers, and symbolic locations as a way to attack U.S. political will and resolve. 3-12. This volatile mix of challenges requires new me thods of deterrence and operational approaches to defeat these threats should deterrence fail. Intellig ence systems must allow commanders to understand enemy intent, predict threat actions, and detect adversary movements. This un derstanding provides them the time necessary to take preventive measures. Long before conflicts occur, these intelligence systems must provide a more thorough understanding of adversaries’ motivations , goals, and organizations to determine effective deterrent COAs. However, there may be adversaries that re main undeterred. Should they acquire WMD or dangerous asymmetric capabilities or demonstrate the intent to mount a surprise attack, the United States must be prep ared to prevent them from striking. A More Complex and Distributed Operational Environment 3-13. Adversaries threaten the United States throughout a complex operational environment, extending from critical regions overseas to the homeland and span ning the global commons of international airspace, waters, space, and cyberspace. An “arc of instability” exists, stretchi ng from the western hemisphere,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 through Africa and the Middle East and extending to Asia . There are areas in this arc that serve as breeding grounds for threats to U.S. interests. Within these areas, rogue states provide sanctuary to terrorists, protecting them from surveillance and attack. Other adversaries take advantage of ungoverned space and undergoverned territories from which they prepare plans, train forces, and launch attacks. These ungoverned areas often coincide with locations of illicit acti vities; such coincidence creates opportunities for hostile coalitions of criminal elements and ideological ex tremists. 3-14. The United States will conduct operations in wi dely diverse locations—from densely populated urban areas located in shore regions to remote, inhos pitable, and austere locations. Military operations in this complex environment may be dramatically different from the high -intensity combat missions for which U.S. forces routinely train. While U.S. armed forces will continue to emphasize precision, speed, lethality, and distributed operations, commanders must expect and plan for the p ossibility that their operations will produce unintended second- and third-order effects. Fo r example, U.S. forces can precisely locate, track, and destroy discrete targets to reduce collateral damage and conclude operations as quickly as possible. Operations that rely on precision may result in large elements of an adversary’s military remaining intact and segments of the population unaf fected. Commanders must prepare to operate in regions where pockets of resistance remain and the potential exists for co ntinued combat operations amid a large number of noncombatants. 3-15. This operational environment places unique dema nds on military organizations and interagency partners and requires more detailed coordination and synchronization of activities both overseas and at home. U.S. experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq highlight the need for a com prehensive strategy to achieve longer-term national goals and objectiv es. The United States must adopt an “active defense-in-depth” that merges joint force, interagency, international NGOs and multinational capabilities in a synergistic manner. This defense does not solely rely on passive measur es. The United States must enhance security at home while actively patrolling strategic approaches an d extending defensive capabilities well beyond U.S. borders. An effective defense-in-depth must also include the capabil ity to strike swiftly at any target around the globe using forces at home as well as forward-based, forward-deploye d, and rotational forces. An Increase in Technology Diffusion and Access 3-16. Global proliferation of a wide range of technology and weaponry will affect the character of future conflict. Dual-use civilian technologies, especially information tec hnologies, high-resolution imagery, and global positioning systems are widely available. These relatively lo w-cost, commercially available technologies will improve the disruptive and destructive capabi lities of a wide range of state and nonstate actors. Advances in automation and information processing wil l allow some adversaries to locate and attack targets both overseas and in the United States. Software tools for netwo rk attack, intrusion, and disruption are globally available over the In ternet, providing almost any intere sted adversary a basic computer network exploitation or a ttack capability. Access to advanced we apons systems and innovative delivery systems could fundamentally change warfighting an d dramatically increase an adversary’s ability to threaten the United States. 3-17. Technology diffusion and access to advanced weapons and delivery systems ha ve significant implications for military capabilities. The United States mus t have the ability to deny adversaries such disruptive technologies and weapons. However, the armed forces cannot s olely focus on these threats and cannot assume there are no other challenges on the ho rizon. Ensuring current readiness while continuing to transform and maintain unchallenged military superior ity will require investment. These are not mutually exclusive goals. The armed forces must remain ready to fight even as th ey transform and transform even as they fight. Applicability of National Policy to Army Sp ecial Operations Forces Un conventional Warfare 3-18. The key components of these national policy documents have direct implicati ons for the conduct of ARSOF UW. The NSS states that U.S. policy is “to seek and support democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture” and identifies that this bold and noble policy is “the work of generations.” This deliberately stated American support for democracy is consistent with the SF motto “to free the oppressed.” The seeking out and supporting of democratic movements—e ven within nondemocratic state regimes—imply the utility of ARSOF UW in denied , hostile, and sensitive areas. The"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-5 focused persistence required for a generational effort is consistent wi th the long-term shaping, political work, and partner organization-building fundamental to understanding UW. 3-19. Likewise, the strategic objectives of the NDS repr esent imperatives for the ARSOF execution of and strengths for the conduct of UW. ARSO F are a military asset whose role in UW contributes to dissuading, deterring, and defeating adversaries (especially extr emists); securing strategic access to key regions; strengthening alliances and partnerships; and working with others i n the USG to achieve these goals. 3-20. Finally, although the military objectives related in the NMS—protect the United States, prevent conflict, and prevail against adversaries—are essentially timeless imperatives for all U.S. armed forces (not just ARSOF), the key aspects of the security envi ronment reflect the specific utility of ARSOF UW. ARSOF are adept at operating against a wider range of a dversaries, in part, because of regional orientation and expertise in remote global areas. The more comp lex and distributed battlespace includes many of these same remote, unusual, and hostile areas. Moreover, one implication of technology diffusion and access means that adversarial conflict is no longer the prerog ative of nation-state standing armed forces; modern adversaries empowered by 21st century technologies are now more likely to be prevalent in the same remote and unusual operational environments in which ARSOF thrive and A RSOF UW is often conducted. 3-21. The following paragraphs highlight special attributes and strengths that ARSOF bring to the conduct of UW. As stated earlier, ARSOF predominantly co nduct UW. However, the USA does not train, assess and equip all ARSOF to conduct UW. SF, PSYOP, and CA elements primaril y conduct ARSOF UW, while other ARSOF units, such as Rangers, engage in other SO. FM 3-05, Army Special Operations Forces , provides a general coverage of all ARSOF SO. M ILITARY C ONCEPTS AND D OCTRINE 3-22. Since UW is defined as “operations conducted by, with, or through irregu lar forces to support insurgency, resistance, and conventional military opera tions,” not all UW is a component of the WOT. Nevertheless, the WOT is a national priority that can involve s ignificant use of ARSOF to conduct UW against adversarial states, supporters of terrorists, and a wide varie ty of nonstate actors. 3-23. ARSOF are the executors of and functional proponent for UW under the authority of C ommander, USSOCOM. Currently, there is no authoritative inte ragency or joint doctrine specifically for UW— although sufficient joint doctrine exists for general campaign design and execution of joint and Army operations. This manual is the overarching doctrinal refere nce that specifically addresses UW as conducted by ARSOF. FM 3-05.201 contains detailed TTP for UW. The spectrum of likely ope rations describes a need for ARSOF in joint, combined, and multinational formations for a va riety of missions including UW. A RMY S PECIAL O PERATIONS F ORCES IN S UPPORT OF THE W AR ON T ERRORISM 3-24. ARSOF are continuously engaged in the WOT. USSOCOM is the lead COCOM for planning, synchronizing, and, as directed, executing global operations against terror ist networks in coordination with (ICW) other CCDRs. The Commander, USSOCOM, leads a global collaborative planni ng process leveraging other COCOM capabilities and expertise that results in decentra lized execution by both USSOCOM and other COCOMs against terrorist networks . Internally, USSOCOM considers its role in the process of synchronizing DOD efforts in the WOT to be a core task of its headquarters (HQ), with specific responsibilities including— Integrating DOD strategy, plans, intelligence priorities, and operatio ns against terrorist networks, as designated by the SecDef. Planning campaigns against terrorist networks and exercising command and control (C2) of operations in support of selected campaigns, as directed. Prioritizing and synchronizing theater secur ity cooperation activities, deployments, and capabilities supporting campaigns against desi gnated terrorist netw orks ICW the GCCs.

Planning, executing, or synchronizing the execution of shaping operati ons ICW the GCCs."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 3-25. ARSOF support the WOT by providing forces trained and equipped to suppo rt the USSOCOM effort. ARSOF support USSOCOM’s strategy for winning the WOT by conductin g SO (including UW) to find, fix, and finish terrorists globally. ARSOF employ their forces to sh ape the global informational and geographic operational environment by conducting SO (including UW) to influenc e, deter, locate, isolate, and destroy terrorists and their support systems. 3-26. ARSOF face the four persistent and emerging challenges in this new, more uncertain era: traditional, irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive. Often, no hard boundaries distin guish one challenge from another. Indeed, the most dangerous circumstances are those where ARSOF face, or will face, multiple challenges simultaneously. 3-27. ARSOF are a key enabler in the WOT by conducting SO (including UW) that obtain actionable intelligence. Such intelligence assists commanders in dete rmining the appropriate force package and in preparing the force to destroy terrorist networks. In UW, ARSOF combine with irregular forces acting alone or in combination with joint conventional fo rce operations. ARSOF conducting UW can operate in hostile, denied, or sensitive environments to collect, monito r, or verify information of strategic or operational significance, often requiring low-visibility techniques. ARSOF can feed the results of these activities directly to a commander or Country Team or input them into th e intelligence process for processing, analyzing, and disseminating to military and OGAs. Range of Military Operations 3-28. The United States employs ARSOF capabilities at home and abroad in support of U.S. national security goals in a variety of operations. ARSOF conduct UW in suppor t of major operations and campaigns when necessary. However, ARSOF conduct the majority of UW belo w the threshold of armed conflict between nation-states. Such relatively discrete and indirect activities allow the United States to engage partners and adversaries in a manner that helps shape the global opera tional environment and keep the day-to-day tensions between nations or groups be low the threshold of armed conflict while maintaining U.S. global influence. Such UW operations provide a wide range of suppor t to irregular forces conducive to furthering U.S. interests. Although SF are designed to support such irregular forces in a combat role if necessary, a majority of ARSOF UW involves SF, PS YOP, and CA activities that do not involve combat. Global Nature of Operations 3-29. ARSOF have global reach and are capable of engaging threats and influencin g potential adversaries with a variety of capabilities (including UW). The conduct of UW by ARSOF provides national decision makers a tool for engaging adversarial states controlling hostile or d enied territory, which may otherwise be beyond the reach of U.S. influence. However, global reach and influence are not just the purview of nation-states. Globalization and emer ging technologies allow small gro ups to use asymmetric approaches, to include criminal activity, terrorism, or armed aggressi on on a transnational scal e, with relative ease and with little cost. The conduct of UW by ARSOF allo ws discrete and effective engagement of these adversarial nonstate actors as well. 3-30. Adversaries understand that direct challenges to U.S. power are likely to be a losing proposition. Therefore, adversaries often place greater emphasis on de veloping capabilities to th reaten the United States indirectly. Increased interdependence of national economies and rapid movement of information around the world create significant challenges in the defense of U.S. interests. Identifying potential threats (both state and nonstate actors) operating independently or in loose coalitions , determining their intent, and determining the best COA to counter their actions are interagency and mul tinational challenges for the United States. In conjunction with the other instruments of power, the m ilitary use of ARSOF in UW provides a means of addressing such indirect threats. 3-31. The elusive nature of adversaries and the ever-i ncreasing speed of global communications and the media demand greater adaptability and networking from ARSOF, particularly communications and intelligence resources. Consequently, ARSOF conduct oper ations on a global scale as part of the NSS. ARSOF conducts UW operations in depth, focusing on the threat source across geographical regions. ARSOF Soldiers’ routine employment in forward regions, developed expertise in deal ing with foreign"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-7 irregular forces and peoples, discretion, and versatility make the conduct of UW an effective tool for seeking out such elusive opponents. Military Engagement, Security Cooperation, and Deterrence 3-32. These ongoing and specialized activities establish, shape, mai ntain, and refine relations with other nations and domestic civil authoritie s. Security cooperati on involves all DOD inter actions with foreign defense establishments to build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. sec urity interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-def ense and multinational operations, and provide ARSOF with peacetime and contingency access to an HN. An HN internal defense and development (IDAD) program may include nation assistance, FID, security assistance, humanitarian and civic assistance, antiterrorism, DOD support to counterdrug operations, show -of-force operations, arms control, and so on. In addition to ARSOF participation in these missions, ARSOF may al so conduct UW that supports the WOT within the context of military engagement, s ecurity coordination, and deterrence. UW capabilities developed within an HN may give capable irregular forces the abilit y to defeat terrorist threats within their sovereign borders. Limited Contingency Operations 3-33. The United States often uses ARSOF to respond to a crisis that does not require large-scale combat operations to resolve. A limited contingency opera tion can be a single small-scale, limited-duration operation or a significant part of a major operation of extended duration involving com bat. The associated general strategic and operational objectives are to prot ect U.S. interests and to prevent surprise attack or further conflict. The levels of complexity, duration, and resources depend on the c ircumstances. Included are operations to ensure the safety of American citizens and U.S. interes ts while maintaining and improving U.S. ability to operate with multinational partners in deterring th e hostile ambitions of potential aggressors. Many of these operations involve a combination of conventional and unconventional forces and capabilities in close cooperation with OGAs and NGOs. ARSOF co nduct of UW in these cas es is likely to be a supporting effort to other SO or conventional operations. Major Operations and Campaigns 3-34. When required to achieve national strategic objectives or to protect national inte rests, the U.S. national leadership may decide to conduct a major operation or campaign involvi ng large-scale combat, placing the United States in a wartime state. In such cases, the general goal is to prevail against the enemy as quickly as possible; to conclude hostilities; and to establish conditions favorable to the HN, the United States, and its multinational partners. ARSOF conduct UW in support of such major combat operations either directly or indirectly. Types of Military Operations 3-35. Army doctrine addresses the range of full-spectrum operations across the spectrum of conflict, as described in FM 1, The Army . Army commanders at all echelons may combine different ty pes of operations simultaneously and sequentially to accomplish missions. For each mission, the J FC and Army component commander determine the emphasis Army for ces place on each type of operation. Army Full-Spectrum Operations 3-36. Missions in any environment require ARSOF to be prepared to conduct any co mbination of offensive, defensive, stability, and civil-support opera tions described below. However, the conduct of UW by ARSOF has particular strengths and wea knesses within the context of each operation: Offensive operations destroy or defeat an enemy . Their purpose is to impose U.S. will on the enemy and to achieve decisive victory. ARSOF elements conducting UW are typically small and therefore of limited direct offensive value to a JFC. However, ARSOF Soldiers’ particular excellence in serving as a force multiplier of irregular combat forces in UW makes ARSOF a potentially valuable indirect element of offensive power. Moreover, since ARSOF conduct of UW frequently occurs in an adversary’s rear area, the coordinated application of ARSOF-led"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 irregular forces to the JFC’s operational plan can provide offensive advantages in surprise, maneuver, and economy of force. Defensive operations defeat an enemy attack, buy time, economi ze forces, or develop conditions favorable for offensive operations . Defensive operations alone normally cannot achieve a decision. As with offensive operations, ARSOF conducting UW are of l imited direct defensive value because of their small element size and ty pically isolated and unsupported positioning. However, when ARSOF use UW to leverage irregula r forces into larger combat formations, they can play a significant indirect defensive role. Moreover, whereas the JFC may be conducting a defensive mission at the strategic, operational, or tactical levels, ARSOF Soldiers’ typical positioning in the adversary’s rear area and in support of irregular forces place ARSOF UW elements in position to conduct offensive missions with strategic, operational, and tactical significance to the JFC’s conduct of the defense. Stability operations promote and protect U.S. national interests by influencing the threat, political, and information dimensions of the operational envir onment through a combination of peacetime developmental, cooperative activitie s and coercive actions in response to crises . The United States can employ ARSOF to assist civil authorities (fore ign or domestic) in responding to crises and in relieving suffering. As part of a larger USG interagency strategy , ARSOF UW activities can be useful in supporting the conduct of stability operations. (More information on these often classified activities can be found in FM 3-05.201.) Civil support operations address the consequences of man-made or natural ac cidents and incidents beyond the capabilities of civilian authorities . Army forces do not conduct stability operations within the United States—under U.S. law, the federal and state governments are responsible for those tasks. Instead, Army fo rces conduct civil-sup port operations when requested, providing Army expertise and capab ilities to lead agency authorities. ARSOF does not conduct UW within the United States. 3-37. When commanders conduct full-spectrum operations as part of an overseas joint campaign, they combine and sequence offensive, defensive, and stability opera tions to accomplish the mission. The JFC and the SO component commander for a particular mission determine the emphasis ARSOF place on each type of operation (including UW). Throughout the cam paign, offensive, defensive, and stability operations occur simultaneously. As missions change from promoting peace to de terring war and from resolving conflict to war itself, the combinations of and tr ansitions between these op erations require skillful assessment, planning, preparation, and execution. Moreover, ARSOF may sometimes conduct a continuous UW effort throughout the entire duration of an ov erseas joint campaign regardless of any changing emphasis of the conventional force mission, and regardless of joint fo rces’ location within the spectrum of conflict. 3-38. ARSOF can conduct UW in support of the JFC at all levels: Strategic . The strategic level concerns the broadest aspects of national and theater pol icy. Decisions at this level reflect national and multinational goa ls, integrate all the instruments of national power, provide forces, and determine c onstraints on their use. The President or the SecDef and the GCCs determine the strategic-na tional and strategic-theater objectives and the manner of use of military means to achieve them . The President or the SecDef and the GCCs may directly or indirectly (through subordinate commanders) employ ARSOF in pursuit of these objectives. ARSOF conduct of UW provides a na tional-level ability to affect strategic U.S. interests, and the most effective use of ARSOF UW requires a deliberate and comprehensive use of all instruments of national power. In fact, a lthough ARSOF are the military weapon of choice to conduct UW, the other (nonmilitary) instruments of U.S. national power at the strategic level may make up a majority of a successful UW campaign force. Operational . The operational level focuses on theater campaigns and major operations. JF Cs determine operational objectives that lead to the attainment of strategic-theater objectives. The design, organization, and conduct of campaigns an d major operations attain these objectives and, in turn, guide tactical events. A GCC, subordinate unified command commander, J TF commander, Service component commander, or functional component commander may employ ARSOF as part of a joint force to attain th ese operational objectives. ARSOF UW can be an"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-9 integral part of theater campaigns and major operations. The feasibility of UW should be considered in any campaign. Tactical . The tactical level focuses on battles and engagements. Decisions at this level apply combat power to create advantages while in co ntact with or close to the enemy. ARSOF may support tactical actions (offense, defense, and stability actions) des igned to have significant effect in attaining operational objectives. Tactical actions m ay directly attain tactical, operational, and strategic objectives simultaneously, which is espe cially true in the conduct of ARSOF SO (including UW). Th e typical sensitivity of ARSOF UW activities can magnify the positive or negative consequences of tactical success or failure. Principles of War 3-39. ARSOF missions may require unorthodox approaches, but these approaches do not negate the nine traditional principles of war. Ra ther, they place a different emphasis on their combination or relative importance. In some SO missions, surprise achieve d through speed, stealth, au dacity, deception, and new tactics or techniques can be far more effective and efficient than traditional conventional tactics based on massed firepower and tactical maneuvers. The following discussion of the principles of war highlights their application to ARSOF when conducting UW: Objective . Direct every military operation toward a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable objective. ARSOF objectives are as much politi cal, economic, and informational as they are military in nature. This fact is highlighted in UW because the fundamenta l objective of UW is to accomplish activities by, with, or th rough irregular forces as U.S. surrogates. The objective of UW is always inherently political. JFCs and ARSOF UW planners mu st avoid mistaking secondary objectives (such as employing lethal force against an adversary) for the primary objective of persuading the irregular surrogate to take action in concert with U.S. objectives. Offensive . Seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. ARSOF are inherently offensive in nature because they seek to strike or engage the enem y to compel, deter, or counter enemy actions. In UW, such initiative is conducted by, with, or th rough an irregular surrogate. In ARSOF UW, “offensive” is not necessarily synonymous with the application of lethal fo rce. It is imperative that SF, PSYOP, and CA forces conducting UW exploit the initiative by proactively persuading, advising, and gaining the support of irregular for ces and the civilians in the UWOA as part of a comprehensive UW campaign plan. Mass . Concentrate the effects of combat power at the decisive place and time. Commanders mass the effects of overwhelming combat power at the decisive time and place to overwhelm the enemy or to gain control of the situation. AR SOF concentrate the effect s of combat power at critical times and discriminate selected targets to produce decisive results that accomplish the commander’s objectives. The truth of this principle is unchang eable, but what constitutes overwhelming power is relative. Referring to gue rrilla warfare, Mao Tse-tung famously said “The strategy is one to ten, the tactics are ten to one.” The correlation of forces that an ARSOF element may represent to an adversary in UW ma y be a distinct numerical U.S. disadvantage. However, a small force may achieve success if massed at the right time and place, and in the context of a well-conceived plan. Moreover, combat power must not be misun derstood to mean only lethal force. Chapter 2 of this manual and FM 3-24, for example, observe that some of th e best weapons do not shoot. Massing the effects of a properly executed PSYOP or CA plan can have decisive results for ARSOF UW. Economy of force. A llocate minimum essential combat powe r to secondary efforts and employ all combat power available in the most effec tive way possible. ARSOF provide an essential economy of force when military objectives are subordinate to polit ical, economic, and informational objectives. This is particularly true when ARSOF conduct UW. By definition, small ARSOF cadres are often able to leverage huge efforts by indigenous pop ulations, irregular forces, and other surrogates through carefully craf ted psychological appeals, political interaction, and other trust-building activities. In the context of a well-orchestra ted UW campaign plan, the effect of such activities can prove decisive. Maneuver . Place the enemy in a disadvantageous position through the flexible a pplication of combat power. As military units conducting SO , ARSOF elements do conduct maneuver in the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 traditional sense in strategic, operational, and tactical environments a nd possess tremendous capability to gain positions of advantage for the GCC. When conducting UW, ARSOF Soldiers’ ability to leverage segments of the population resi dent in the UWOA can be particularly useful to the campaign plan when ARSOF-supported irre gular forces can apply combat power in the adversary’s secure operating environment. On ce again, combat power in ARSOF UW does not automatically denote lethal force. The properly timed and positioned interdiction of lines of communication, popular uprisings, or sabotaged adversary infrastructure, for e xample, can be flexible applications of comb at power that place the enemy in a disadvantageous position. Unity of command. Ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander for every objectiv e. Theater special operations command (TSOC) commanders under the COCOM of the GCC can either tailor the C2 architecture for ARSOF operations under the direct control of the TSOC or recommend subordinate JFC relationships to ensure unity of effort of SOF. Th erefore, integration, synchronization, and unity of effort for these forces are incumbent upon commanders and staffs at every level. To the extent SF, PSYOP, and CA work t ogether in an ARSOF UW campaign, it is imperative that these forces integrate and coordinate their efforts throughout the duration of the mission. Security . Prohibit the enemy from acquiring an unexpected advantage. ARSOF can prov ide security to the JFC by denying the enemy the ability to use his ex pected advantages. ARSOF provide security through vari ous intelligence-collection methods , force protection (FP), and force applications. The irregular forces and populations indigenous to a UWOA an d engaged by ARSOF can multiply friendly intelligence an d greatly enhance friendly security. Surprise . Strike the enemy at a time and place or in a manner for which he is unprepared. ARSOF can deceive the enemy, inhibit the enem y’s decision making, or restrict the enemy’s capability to react to the commander’s operations or campaign. As irregular forces and target populations engaged by ARSOF multiply friendly intelligence and enh ance security in UW, that same enhanced situational awareness multiplies opportunities to identify adversary weaknesses. Moreover, the discrete building of a UW organization itself in an adversary’s te rritory—and judicious revelation of that organization’s abilities—has the greate st potential for surprise. The calculated use of such surprise can have vital ps ychological effects in an ARSOF UW campaign. Simplicity . Prepare clear, uncomplicated plans and concise orders to ensure a thorough understanding. ARSOF use unorthodox and sophisticated methods and equipment . The plans and procedures the force employs must be simp le and direct to facilitate understanding, to withstand the stress of operational environments, and to allow for rapid adaptation to changing situations. This principle is as valid in UW as it is to other A RSOF SO. However, the fundamental activity of ARSOF UW is a political activity of small-scale human interaction; persuading and leading irregular forces to act in concert with U.S. objectives. As Clausewitz famously noted, “In war everything is simple, but the simplest thing is difficult.” U.S. political interaction with irregular surrogates is inherently difficult and only properly selected and trained ARSOF personnel should conduct UW. Other Principles 3-40. UW is inherently a joint activity, and JP 3-0, Joint Operations , identifies three additional principles ARSOF must consider: restraint, perseverance, and le gitimacy. The following para graphs address each of these principles. Restraint 3-41. The purpose of restraint is to limit collateral dama ge and to prevent the unnecessary or unlawful use of force. A single act could cause significant military and political consequences; therefore, judicious use of force is necessary. Restraint requires the careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security, the conduct of military operations, and the national strategic end state. F or example, the exposure of intelligence-gathering activities could have significant po litical and military repercussions. Because of this, Soldiers should exercise sound judgment when conducting intellige nce gathering. Excessive force antagonizes other parties involved, thereby damaging the legitimacy of th e organization using excessive force and potentially enhancing the legitimacy of the opposing party."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-11 3-42. ARSOF commanders at all levels must take proactiv e steps to ensure their personnel are properly trained in the rules of engagement (ROE) and are quickly informed of any changes. In multinational operations, use of force may be dictated by coalition or allied force ROE. Failure to understand and comply with established ROE can result in fratricid e, mission failure, or national embarrassment. 3-43. The use of ARSOF in UW has several special considerations regarding re straint. At a national strategic level, the use of discrete ARSOF UW operations can itself be a mea sure of U.S. restraint. Small, highly trained ARSOF elements working by, with, or through irregular surrogat es in UW can sometimes eliminate the need for large-scale U.S. military operations. This indi rect use of military power through ARSOF UW can provide significant strategic results supporting U.S. object ives while providing a perception of USG restraint. However, the very se nsitivity of some ARSOF UW operations can magnify USG embarrassment if exposed. Therefore, use of ARSOF UW in highly sensitive situations requires careful consideration of risk. 3-44. An additional restraint complexity in ARSOF UW involves the inherent nature of working by, with, or through irregular surrogates. Although a successful ARSOF UW opera tion may not require U.S. forces to apply any lethal force wh atsoever, persuading and leading irregular surrogates to act in concert with U.S. objectives is a human political interaction that is inherent ly difficult to control. ARSOF personnel conducting UW must impart a notion of restraint to th eir irregular counterparts. Unrestrained actions by irregular forces working with ARSOF may reflect badly on the United S tates, may provoke adversary force retaliation or international political condemnation, and may result in coun terproductive popu lar resistance within the UWOA, all of which may jeopardize the mission. 3-45. The foreign, often hostile, and sometimes remote locations that A RSOF typically executes UW in make the maintenance of restraint more difficult. JTF commanders and ARSOF elements must thoroughly understand the cultural and legal customs of the UWOA. Traditional regard for life a nd rule of law (or lack thereof) may differ greatly from conventional battlefiel ds and international sta ndards of behavior. ARSOF must understand and anticipate such differences be fore infiltrating the UWOA. Since ARSOF personnel conducting UW will typically be part of small U.S. el ements within a large foreign environment and often beyond rapid U.S. support, the selection, preparation, and judgment of th e ARSOF personnel are crucial considerations. If U.S. irregular surrogates continuously behave in a manner that jeopa rdizes U.S. interests, the maintenance of U.S. restraint may require ending the UW mission. Perseverance 3-46. The purpose of perseverance is to ensure the co mmitment necessary to attain the national strategic end state. Some joint operations may require years to reach the term ination criteria, and ARSOF must anticipate operations that are both measured and protracted. The underlying causes of the crisis may be elusive, making the achievement of decisive resolution difficult. The pat ient, resolute, and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives is often a requirement for success. This effort frequently involves measures from all instruments of U.S. national power to supplement military efforts . 3-47. Perseverance in pursuit of U.S. objectives is fundamental to the conduct of ARSOF UW. If the seeking out and support of democratic elements in ev ery nation and culture as outlined in the NSS is “the work of generations” and ARSOF UW is a central t ool to achieve this policy, ARSOF UW requires a persistence of USG effort far beyond most other enterprises of g overnment. One appeal of most SO (such as direct action) to policy makers and commanders is that SO are of relativel y short duration and often promise dramatic and easily quantifiable results. Most ARSOF UW, by contra st, may take years or decades to develop properly, and clear results may not be dramatic, easily meas ured, or readily gratified. Perhaps more than any other military operation, ARSOF UW requires patient effort . Legitimacy 3-48. The purpose of legitimacy is to develop and main tain the will necessary to attain the national strategic end state. The basis for legitimacy is the legality, mora lity, and rightness of the actions undertaken, as well as the will of the U.S. public to support the acti ons. Legitimacy is frequently a decisive element. The perception of legitimacy by the U.S. public is strengthened if obviou s national or humanitarian interests are at stake and American lives are not being needlessly or carelessly placed at risk."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Other interested audiences may include foreign nations , civil populations in the UWOA, and participating forces. 3-49. ARSOF committed to a UW operation must sustain th e legitimacy of the operation and of irregular surrogates with which they work, where applicable. The USG must ba lance legitimacy concerns with actions by U.S.-sponsored irregular forces. The USG must consider all actions in the light of potentially competing strategic and tactical requirements and must exhibit fairness in dealing with competing factions, where appropriate. In some cases of ARSOF UW, the use of force is both appropriate and necessary. However, judicious restraint in the use of force by U.S. and U.S.-sponsored irregular forces will likely reinforce legitimacy. 3-50. Legitimacy may depend on adherence to objectiv es agreed to by the international community, ensuring the action is appropriate to the situation, and fairness in dealing with various factions. Howeve r, since ARSOF UW is particularly useful in sensitive en vironments, U.S. legitimacy may depend on the UW operation itself not being exposed. By contrast, exposure of or creating the percepti on of an adversary’s illegitimacy is a common PSYOP theme in ARSOF UW. CONVENTIONAL WARFARE AND MA JOR COMBAT OPERATIONS 3-51. Although conventional forces, SOF, and the interagenc y force can all play some role in any type of warfare, each of these forces play s either a leading or supporting ro le. Conventional warfare, which has historically been typified by MCO, is characterized by the predominan t role of conventional forces with SOF and the interagency force in support. C ONVENTIONAL F ORCES 3-52. The Capstone Concept for Joint Operations and MCO describes how the future joint force intends to conduct combat operations in support of national military objectives. Futu re major combat operations will— Provide the combat contribution to the larger pr ojection of all instruments of available national power in a tight, seamless, and organically inte grated fashion to achieve political objectives. Emphasize disintegration as the principal mechanis m used to defeat an adversary’s military system. Engulf the adversary through comprehensive engagement in every domain a nd dimension. Be more distributed and interdependently joint. Derive strength from and contribute to continuous global shaping. Utilize both the informational and cognitive domains to create a sense of relentless pressure on and absolute dominance over an adversary. Create and exploit opportunities, many of which are fleeting, while simultaneously denying or spoiling opportunities for the adversary. Reduce, by synergistic joint operations, harmful seams, gaps, and vul nerabilities that heretofore limited rapid, interdependent, distributed, and decisive application of jo int combat power. 3-53. Personnel must consider MCO, IW, and military support to SSTR operations holistically as complementary concepts working together during crises with an end view of restoration of the rule of law and a sustainable peace under civil po licing. Commanders and their interagency and multinational partners should assess the potential integration requirements and oppo rtunities of these operations. 3-54. The U.S. military will fight an uncertain and unpredictable enemy o r, even more demanding, multiple enemy forces simultaneously in widely di spersed joint operations areas (JOAs). The future environment will be characterized by— Globalization. Complex terrain. Dynamic coalitions, alliances, and partnerships."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-13 3-55. The joint force will face a range of adaptive, thinking adversaries with access to militarily useful capabilities. These adversaries will sometimes pose co mplex combinations of traditional, irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive challenges. The Military Problem 3-56. Adversaries with capable militaries, including acces s denial, IO, advanced conventional, WMD, and IW capabilities may creatively use them in new ways to coerce or attack U.S. fr iends or allies, threaten regional stability, or take other actions that pose an unacceptab le threat to the United States. The U.S. military must be capable of defeating such adversaries while minimiz ing the prospects for unintended escalation and considering the burdens of postwar transition and reconstruction. 3-57. The military problem describes the enemy and its behavior using a systems ap proach. Disintegration of the enemy system through integrated destruction and dislocation w ill be the defeat mechanism used to compel the enemy to accede to U.S. will. The Military Solution 3-58. The joint force, supported by other instrument s of national power, will conduct synergistic, high-tempo actions in multiple domains to shatter the coherence of the adversary’s plans and dispositions and render him unable or unwilling to militarily oppose the achiev ement of U.S. strategic objectives. 3-59. Should the failure of peaceful preventive measures dictate the use of force, the United States, preferably with multinational partners but unilatera lly if required, will conduct MCO to overmatch and overwhelm the enemy and deny the use of and contain enemy-held WMD. 3-60. Combat operations are those inherently military actions taken directl y or indirectly to defeat an adversary’s military. Under the long-standing principle of self-defense, commande rs may be required to conduct offensive operations against undeterred adversarie s that pose an unmistakab le threat of grave harm to national security interests. In any case, once the co mmander decides to respond with the use of force, the U.S. military rapidly conducts joint offensive and defensive combat operations to defeat the enemy. Moreover, the JFC must anticipate setting the conditions fo r stability in the crisis area. To do this, the joint force aims to see first, understand first, decide first, and act first in a cyclic process and ultimately finish decisively. S PECIAL O PERATIONS F ORCES 3-61. Five basic criteria facilitate the employment of ARSOF in support of t he joint force campaign or operation plan (OPLAN). These criteria provide guid elines for conventional and ARSOF commanders and planners to use when considering the employment of ARSOF: Is the mission appropriate? Commander use ARSOF to achieve e ffects that require their unique skills and capabilities. If the effects do not re quire those skills and capabilities, commanders should not assign ARSOF to the operation. Commander should not use ARSOF as a substitute for other forces. Does the mission support the campaign plan? If the mission does not support the JFC’s campaign or major OPLAN, the JFC should consider ARSOF for more appropriate missions available. Is the mission operationally feasible? ARSOF are not structured fo r attrition or force-on-force warfare. As such, commanders should not assi gn them to missions beyond their capabilities. ARSOF commanders and their staffs must consider the vulnerability of ARSOF units to larger, more heavily armed or mobile forces in hostile territory. Are required resources available for the mission? Some ARSOF missions require support from other forces for success. Suppor t involves aiding, protecting, complementing, and sustaining employed ARSOF. Support can include airlif t, intelligence, communications, IO, medical, logistics, space, weather, and numerous other types of support. Although a target may be"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-14 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 vulnerable to ARSOF, deficiencies in supportability may affect the likelihood for success or may entirely invalidate the feasibility of employing ARSOF. Will the outcome of the mission justify the risk? ARSOF have high value and limited resources. Commanders must make sure the benefits of su ccessful mission execution are measurable and in balance with the risks inherent in the mission assessment. Some operations that ARSOF can execute make only a marginal contribution to the JFC’s campaign plan and presen t great risk to personnel and materiel. Commanders should recognize the high value and lim ited resources of ARSOF. Risk management considers not only the potential loss of ARSOF un its and equipment but also the risk of adverse effects on U.S. diplomatic and politic al interests if the mission fails. Army Special Operations Forces Capabilities 3-62. The unique capabilities of ARSOF (including those pertinent to UW) are a function of the quality of ARSOF Soldiers, the training and education of those Soldiers, and the mission profiles the Soldiers must execute. The competitive ARSOF selection process, co upled with technological training and education, produces an ARSOF Soldier who is adaptable, matu re, innovative, culturally aware, self-assured, and self-reliant. Thus, policy decision makers use ARSOF as a force to expand the range of available options. 3-63. ARSOF are specially organized, trained, and equi pped military forces. They conduct SO (including UW) to achieve military, political, economic, or info rmational objectives by generally unconventional means in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive areas. Decision makers may choose the ARSOF option because ARSOF provide the broadest range of capabilities that have direct applicab ility in an increasing number of environments. Political-military requiremen ts frequently cast ARSOF into clandestine or low-visibility environments that require oversight at the national level. ARSOF operations differ from conventional force operations by their degree of acceptable physical and political risk, their modes of employment, and their operational techniques. ARSOF allow the unified commande r or JFC to perform critical small-unit missions that directly or indirec tly support the objective of his operational mission. 3-64. Early use of ARSOF in an operation may prevent or limit conflict and conserve na tional resources. When conflict is imminent, the USG may use ARSOF in a variety of preho stility missions to signal determination, to demonstrate support to allies, and to begin the co mplicated processes of positioning forces for combat and shaping the AO. 3-65. During conflict, ARSOF may be most effective in conducting strategic or operational economy-of-force operations (including UW) that generate military and diploma tic advantages disproportionate to the resources they represent. ARSOF—or the irre gular forces they support when conducting UW—can locate, seize, or destroy strategic or operatio nal targets and obtain critical intelligence. They can analyze an enemy’s defenses and diminish enemy morale. ARSOF can disorganize, disrupt, and demoralize enemy troops. They can also divert the enemy’s important resources. 3-66. ARSOF expand the options of the President, the SecDef, and GCCs, partic ularly in crises and contingencies that fall between wholly diplomatic initia tives and the overt use of large conventional forces. The small size, rapid reaction, and self-sufficient nature of ARSOF elements provide military options that do not involve the risk of escalation normally associated with larger, mo re visible conventional forces. The use of ARSOF enables decision makers to prevent a conflict or to limit i ts scope. Therefore, decision makers can better control committed U.S. forces and resources. When conducting UW in support of conventional operations, ARSOF can support irregular surrogates acting in concert with U.S. objectives, further limiting the scope of involvement by U.S. forces. 3-67. ARSOF are adept at using lethal force. However, ARSOF conducting UW need not always use let hal force in a mission. Language skills, cross-cultural training, regional orient ation, and understanding of the political context of operational areas make ARSOF unpa ralleled when operating in complex environments. ARSOF skills enable them to work as effectively with civilian populat ions as with other military forces to favorably influence situations toward U.S. national inte rests. This ability to apply discreet leverage is a very important ARSOF contribution to the NMS."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-15 Characteristics 3-68. To ensure UW missions in support of conventional operations sel ected for ARSOF are compatible with their capabilities, commanders must be fa miliar with the following SO characteristics: ARSOF personnel undergo careful selection processes or mission-specifi c training beyond basic military skills to achieve entry-level SO skills . Being proficient in these skills makes rapid replacement or generation of personnel or capabilities highly unlikely. Mature, experienced personnel make up ARSOF. Ma ny maintain a high level of competency in more than one military specialty. Most ARSOF are regionally oriented for employment. Cross-cultural communi cation skills are a routine part of their training and represent a fundamental characteristic of their utility in UW. ARSOF conduct specific tactical operations by small units with unique talents that directly strike or engage strategic and operational aims or objectives. More importantly for UW, ARSOF are able to persuade and provide support for irregular forces to make such engagements. T hese direct tactical engagements often represent indirect operational and strategic appr oaches for the JFC. Planning for SO may begin at the unified, joint, or interagency level for exec ution that requires extensive, rigorous rehearsal. Protracted UW campaigns usually requir e early interagency coordination. SO are frequently clandestine or low-visibility operations, or they may b e combined with overt operations. SO can be covert but require a declar ation of war or a specific finding approved by the President or the SecDef. ARSOF can deploy at relatively low cost , with a low profile less intrusive than that of larger conventional forces. Selected ARSOF units often conduct SO at great distances from operational bases. T hese units employ sophisticated communications systems and means of insertion, suppo rt, and extraction to penetrate and return from hostile, denied, or politically sensit ive areas. SO occur throughout the range of military operations. SO influence the will of foreign leadership to cr eate conditions favorable to U.S. strategic aims and objectives. SO are often high-risk operations that have limited windows of execution and re quire first-time success. However, although UW will often be a high-risk special operatio n, it typically involves a longer time frame of activities and a long-ter m USG commitment. Also, the results of UW operations may take years or decades to materialize. ARSOF SF, PSYOP, and CA units are ideally suited to perform SO with, through, or by indigenous personnel . SO require theater- and, frequently, national-level intelligence support. Selected SO (especially UW) require a detailed knowledge of the cult ural nuances and languages of a country or region where employed. SO are inherently joint and sometimes multinational, requiring intera gency and international coordination. The contribution of ARSOF to national security is greatest when the JFC fully integrates ARSOF into his plan at the earliest stages of planning. ARSOF can be task-organized quickly and deployed rapidly to provide tai lored responses to many different situations. However, while Soldie rs can conduct UW in quick reaction to events, such as OEF/Afghanistan, this quic k-reaction use of UW is atypical. Selected ARSOF can gain access to hostile and denied areas. ARSOF can provide limited security and medical support for themselves. Selected ARSOF can live in austere, harsh environments without extensive support. For long-duration operations, ARSOF require support from the Army Service component command (ASCC). Selected ARSOF can survey and assess local situ ations and rapidly report these assessments. Selected ARSOF can work closely with regional military and civilian au thorities and populations."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-16 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 3-69. ARSOF are not a substitute for conventional forces. They are, however, a n ecessary adjunct to the capabilities of existing conventional forces. ARSOF characteristics and ability to conduct UW can contribute significantly to conventional forces and MCO. I NTERAGENCY A CTIVITIES 3-70. Multinational and interagency partners have special capabiliti es that contribute to achieving dominant effects in support of unified action, as well as achievin g military and political objectives and end states. The United States routinely integrates and ex ecutes multinational and interagency actions rapidly and coherently in support of the JFC. As the JFC integrates interagency capabilities into his plan, he similarly integrates ARSOF SF, PSYOP, and CA elem ents conducting UW in support of the conventional plan with the interagency. 3-71. The JFC integrates multinational capabilities and co llaborates with interagency and international partner leaders during planning and throughout the campaign to achieve syner gies, further isolate, and deny sanctuary to the enemy. The U.S. military uses day- to-day interactions, frequent preconflict engagement venues, periodic joint C2 training exercises, an extensive and vigorous li aison program, and an expanded collaborative information environment to build favorable and practi ced relationships with these partners. The U.S. military fosters the development of interoperable and well-trai ned alliance and coalition capabilities that can readily plug into plans and operations. The U .S. military uses forward basing and security cooperation to build strong, mutually supporting relationsh ips with these partners. Conceivably, more permanent U.S.-led multinational force (MNF) HQ will emerge at t he operational level in the future when mutually beneficial to the U.S. and other supportive governments . The JFC combines and exploits joint warfighting doctrine, organizations, training, technology, and leade rship with special contributions from other partners to achieve desired operational-level objectives. 3-72. The JFC will also use automated synchronization and coordination too ls to align and coordinate military activities with diplomatic, informational, economic, and oth er activities within the context of coalition planning and execution en vironments. Autonomous synchronization tools will provide traceability of allocated resources and shared responsibilities to e ffects generated. This synchronization record will allow national governments, inte rnational organizations, and cert ain NGO partners to trace their contributions to achieving common strategic objectiv es, as well as specific organizational objectives. 3-73. The interagency has a vital role in gaining and maintaining domina nce in the information environment. Strategic-level information and influence strategies are critical to addressing traditional, irregular, disruptive, and catastrophic challenges and extend beyond the purview of the military commander alone. Therefore, the JFC information and influence plans must contribute to and be consistent with the higher-level strategy. Accordingly, well-conceived, well-coordinated, a nd well-executed operational-level information and influence plans are critical prerequisites when dealin g with future operational challenges. To decisively influence an adversary, it is critical th at the United States unders tands their decision-making process and their perceptions. “One-size-fits-all” information campaigns or influence strategies cannot overcome the unique problems each adversary presents, especially when fanaticism is a primary motivator for an irregular adversary. With concise strate gic-level guidance and interagency and multinational participation, a comprehensive information and infl uence campaign embraces strategic-level intent and supports achievement of both military and political objectives. 3-74. In the early stages of conflict, the adversary is likely to possess the initiative in the information environment. To wrest the initiative from the adversary, a comprehens ive set of offensive and defensive actions must occur. The innovative combination of electronic weapons platforms, networking systems, and strategic- and operational-level PSYOP, enabled by the net-centric operational e nvironment, creates significant opportunities to seize the initiative and dominate an e nemy. The solution set varies depending on, for example, whether the adversary employs traditional or irregular and asymmetri c methods and whether the center of gravity is a military entity or a noncombatant pop ulation. Essentially, each operation and campaign requires a customized approach within the strategic info rmation strategy to gain and maintain the initiative in the information environment. 3-75. Communication of the threat to use lethal force may be sufficient to infl uence and pressure an adversary or an equivocating actor to yield. If not, the actual measured us e of lethal force is obviously a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-17 viable method to force an actor to give in to U.S. will. In either case, the JFC attacks the adversary’s information networks and messages to limit the advers ary’s ability to counter the JFC’s IO and influence activities. The JFC understands that his options are situ ation-dependent and a matter of his operational art. 3-76. How and what the media report can affect the political and public support necessary for the achievement of military objectives. Commanders must understand and work co ntinuously with the media to gain and maintain an information environment advantag e. Here, a civilian-military media operations center is the JFC’s focal point. A comprehensive and coherent media plan is necessa ry to influence populations and senior decision makers while countering adversary propaganda efforts. In this regard, the JFC may be wise to implement a plan designed to expose affected populations to multinational force values, customs, beliefs, and intentions. This plan is critical for managing expectations, allaying fear s and suspicions, explaining legitimacy, and generating support for the operation, thus minimizi ng public unrest and possible interference. To unhinge the adversary’s information strategy, the JFC promot es a counter ideology as part of his influence and IO strategies that is feasible, practical, and be lievable by the affected civilian populations. Implementing such strategies may involve the early provision of e mergency local communications that demonstrate coalition support to the reest ablishment of essential services. 3-77. The JFC continuously assesses the effectiveness of ongoing IO and influence activities to ensure that these operations support the overall campaign plan. A trusted feedback m echanism must exist to measure the degree of success; otherwise, the JFC may subseque ntly make critical decision s that are exactly wrong. Here, the intelligence system, culturally adept “global scouts,” U.S. interagency staff members, trusted foreign governments, and transnational corporations may provide valuable feedback and recommendations. Potentially, the adversary—traditional or irregular—or other TAs may be unresponsive to ongoing JFC IO and influence activities. Simultaneously, an intelligen t and shrewd adversary may attempt to exploit the information environment to his advantage. Here, the adversary attempt s to nullify or at least degrade U.S. efforts in the information environment. The commander must understand how his o wn, as well as his adversary’s, IO and influence activities are actually proceeding—sensing and understanding ground truth in a timely manner are invaluable. IRREGULAR WARFARE 3-78. The purpose of IW, like any other form of warfare, is to win—to achieve the st rategic purpose of the war. Winning wars and campaigns involves the control of forces, populat ions, and territory. Conventional or “traditional” warfare is a form of warfare between states that empl oys direct military confrontation to defeat an adversary’s armed forces, destroy an adversary’s war-making capacity , or seize or retain territory to force a change in an adversary’s government or policies. The focus of conventi onal military operations is normally an adversary’s armed forces with the objective of influencing the advers ary’s government. It generally assumes that the indigenous populations w ithin the operational area are nonbelligerents and will accept whatever political outcome th e belligerent governments impose, arbitrate, or negotiate. A fundamental military objective in conventional military operations is to minimize civilian interference in those operations. 3-79. In contrast, IW focuses on the control or influence of populations, not on the control of an adversary’s forces or territory. Ultimately, IW is a political struggle with violent and nonviolent components. The struggle is for control or influence over and the support of a rel evant population. The foundation for IW is the centrality of the relevant popula tions to the nature of the conflict. The parties to an IW conflict, whether states or armed groups, seek to undermine their ad versaries’ legitimacy and credibility. They seek to physically and psychologically isolate t heir adversaries from the relevant populations and their external supporters. At the same time, they also s eek to bolster their own legitimacy and credibility to exercise author ity over that same population. 3-80. IW operations also employ subversion, coercion, attrition, and exhaustion to undermine and erode an adversary’s power, influence, and w ill to exercise political authority over a relevant population. Wh at makes IW “irregular” is the focus of its operations (a relevant population), its strategic purpose (to gain or maintain control or influence over), and the support of that relevant populat ion through political, psychological, and economic methods. Creating and maintaining an enduring, functi oning state requires the government to be legitimate in the eyes of the population. On the other extreme , although a brutal dictatorship may control a population, an irregular adversary can exploit t he frustration and dissatisfaction"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-18 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 that this type of government creat es. Warfare that has the population as its focus of operations requires a different mind-set and different capabilities than warfare that focuses on defeating an adversary militarily. I NTERAGENCY R ESPONSIBILITIES 3-81. The military cannot conduct IW operations indefinitely without eventual ly needing responsive support from the interagency. This interagency suppor t can come from a variety of sources; for example, United States, coalition, or multinational. Interagency support provi ded not only must have the right skill sets and capabilities but also must meet capacity requirement s of the conflict. Once interagency support becomes available, the military must be prepared to transition from a supported role to a supporting role. Starting with the initial design of an IW campaign, planne rs must consider the relationship between military forces conducting IW and the responsibilities and roles of t he interagency in IW. Examples of these considerations include— What interagency support is required for successful IW operations? What interagency activities can enhance military IW operations? What military planning could be done better by an interagency partner ? What are the implications related to the military performing securit y, diplomatic, information, economic, nation-building, rule of law, and g overnance functions in the absence of robust interagency involvement? How long should the military be prepared to accomplish these functions before the interagency arrives in force? What conditions need to be set to allow the military to transiti on these nontraditional military support roles to the interagency? S PECIAL O PERATIONS F ORCES 3-82. IW includes a wide variety of indirect operations and activities tha t occur in isolation or within traditional interstate combat operations. Half of the 14 componen t activities of IW are current core tasks for ARSOF. Therefore, ARSOF usually play a central and leading role in IW. Moreover, UW is one of the IW activities, and three others—(support for) insurg encies, PSYOP, and CMO (as conducted by ARSOF through CAO)—are the central components of the ARSOF UW mission. 3-83. Some IW activities, such as terrorism and transnati onal crime, violate international law. U.S. law and national policy prohibit U.S. military forces or O GAs from engaging in or supporting such activities. However, since adversaries employ terrorism and tran snational criminal activities against the interests of the United States and its partners, these activities are included b elow as examples of the range of operations and activities that can be conducted as part of IW: Insurgency (support for which is the purpose of UW). COIN. UW (ARSOF core task). Terrorism. CT (ARSOF core task). FID (ARSOF core task). SSTR operations. SC. PSYOP (ARSOF core task and a central component of the ARSOF UW miss ion). IO (ARSOF support to IO). CMO (as conducted through the ARSOF core task of CAO, is a central co mponent of the ARSOF UW mission). Intelligence and CI activities. Transnational criminal activities, including narc o-trafficking, illicit arms dealing, and illegal financial transactions, that support or sustain IW. Law enforcement activities focused on countering irregul ar adversaries."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Policy and Doctrine 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 3-19 3-84. At the core of IW are insurgency and COIN. The pu rpose of insurgency is to overthrow and replace an established government or societal structure. Te rrorism and CT are activities conducted as part of IW and are frequently subactivities of insurgency and COIN . However, terrorism may also stand alone when its purpose is to coerce or intimidate governments or societies without overthrowin g them. FID refers to the participation of the agencies of one government in the programs of anot her government to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency. FID is thus the ext ernal support component of COIN. 3-85. UW most frequently refers to the military and paramilitary aspects of an i nsurgency designed to resist, overthrow, or gain political autonomy from an established government, or used to resist or expel a foreign occupying po wer. However, UW can also refer to milita ry and paramilitary support to an irregular armed group seeking increased power and influence rela tive to its political rivals without overthrowing the central government and in the absen ce of a foreign occupying power. SSTR operations are an essential component of COIN campaigns, but SSTR operations, such as foreign disaster relie f or foreign humanitarian assistance (FHA), can also occur ou tside the context of IW or armed conflict. 3-86. PSYOP, CMO, IO, and intelligence and law enforcem ent activities can occur in MCO, IW, or SSTR operations. They are listed above because their role in IW is often propor tionally greater than is the case in MCO. They all directly affect the operational focus of IW—the relevant populations—in ways that combat operations do not. 3-87. In practice, most wars and campaigns are hybrids of conventional and IW operations. The balance or primary focus of operations gives a war, campai gn, or major operation its predominant character. C ONVENTIONAL F ORCES 3-88. Campaign planning for support of IW operations in a long war is differe nt than planning for shorter conventional operations against an adversary during MCO. The adversary faced during IW operations usually operates without space and time limits. He may be a state or a nonsta te actor and he often employs asymmetric tactics in a complex environment. The popu lation is important, as is a thorough understanding of religious, cultural, and economic influences. In this regard, the JF C and his staff must be able to effectively accomplish responsive operational planning using techniques t hat effectively respond to the IW threat. Operational command techniques that will work best for th e conduct of IW campaigns and operations during the long war are still evolving. Conventional force s are likely to play a supporting role in most IW efforts. U NCONVENTIONAL W ARFARE W ITHIN I RREGULAR W ARFARE 3-89. While conventional forces most often play the leading role in convent ional warfare, and the interagency can be expected to take the leading role in IW (with or without a supporting UW effort), UW is most often led by SOF. A SOF-led UW campaign will usually require some interagency support and may occasionally involve suppor t by conventional forces. Special Operations Forces 3-90. The application of UW envisioned by joint IW planne rs differs from the more traditional uses of UW and requires further analysis. The characteristics of how ARSOF conduct U W are unchanged regardless of declared adversary; ARSOF operations (including U W) and ARSOF units are flexible. However, joint IW planners properly identify that UW conducted within IW during the 21st century WOT has nontraditional threat characteristics: First, nonstate actors do not have the same centers of gravity or the traditi onal infrastructure that have been the critical nodes for planning traditional UW operations. Second, unlike more typical UW campaigns agains t hostile states or occupying powers, future campaigns will be conducted against nonstate actors operating eit her within or behind the laws of nonbelligerent states with which the United Stat es is not at war. Whereas this is normally the purview of OGAs, analysis of potential support that the joint forc e may be required to provide to"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 3-20 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 support those agencies in that operational area must be done to accurately determine a true picture of the scope of global IW support requirements. Finally, UW campaigns also will be conducted against nonstate acto rs existing outside of the normal institutions of a state (such as ungoverne d or undergoverned area s) or within a hostile state that harbors, either w ittingly or unwittingly, these nonst ate actors within its borders. Interagency Responsibilities 3-91. Just as the global environment of the 21st centu ry and the challenges of the WOT have caused military operations to become more innovative and flexible, so too m ust the interagency adopt new approaches to wielding U.S. national power in combating adversarie s. Political authorities must find innovative ways to manipulate all instruments of U.S. national power agai nst elusive opponents and their supporters. The interagency can apply economic and fi nancial incentives and disincentives to interdict adversary financing, support partners and allies, and dissuade adversary supporters. U.S. law enforcement entities must cooperate with each othe r, international partners, and th e DOD to maximize intelligence and legitimacy and to constrain adversary freedom of move ment. The legitimacy of IW efforts must be a central and persistent theme of any holistic and coordinated information operation. Any UW effort within an IW campaign should integrate the interagency. Conventional Forces 3-92. The JFC and his staff must be able to effectivel y accomplish responsive operational planning using techniques that effectively respond to the IW threat. In some cases, su ch as OEF/Afghanistan or OIF, the JFC will conduct MCO and IW with UW operations simultaneously. In other c ases, such as OEF/Philippines or OEF/Colombia, IW (possibly with UW operations) will be the main effort, with conventional forces playing a mu ch smaller and supporting role. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-1 Chapter 4 Planning Considerations UNCONVENTIONAL WA RFARE PLANNING 4-1. UW planning begins at the theater and national levels, typically using classifi ed channels. In most cases, ARSOF personnel expand the planning effort to provide subject-matter expertise and additional planning manpower. The plan incorporates interagency participation and the contributions of other DOD elements. 4-2. The actual planning of a UW effort—whether it is deliberate or crisis-action planning—utilizes the standard joint operation planning process or military decision-mak ing process described in JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning ; FM 5.0, Army Planning and Orders Production ; and FM 3-05. As any UW effort will include more than just the military instrument of a na tional power, an effects-based approach to planning may be especially useful. 4-3. The following paragraphs discuss the ARSOF imperatives and their a pplicability to UW. Although the imperatives may not equally apply to all specific UW situations, ARSOF commanders must consider each during mission pla nning and execution. U NDERSTAND THE O PERATIONAL E NVIRONMENT 4-4. The most important ARSOF planning consideration is to understand the environme nt where the unit will operate. This consideration may be divided into two factors—in ternal and external. Internal Factors 4-5. The civilian population is the critical internal factor. ARSOF planners must understand the demography, culture, taboos, beliefs, customs, history, goals, ethnic composition, a nd expectations of the civilian population. Most importantly, planners must recognize the dynamics of the many correlations among the various aspects of a society. Planners must be aware of who the agents of influence are, who they target, and how that influence may be achieved and exercised. They must also be aware of any incidental effect that the actions with any one factor might have upon another. External Factors 4-6. Planners must understand the U.S. military comma nd relationships (Service and joint, military and interagency) that may affect ARSOF elements and supported irregular force s. In addition, planners must understand the— Scope and limitations of each ag ency’s influence and programs. Legal and political restrictions on ARSOF activities. Sources and assistance available to ARSOF to further assure mission accomplishment. Role of the U.S. media and the international press. Intent and goals of the USG. Intent and goals of NGOs, humanitarian relief or ganizations, and other key civilian agencies in the UWOA. Command relationships of international agencies and NGOs with representatives of the USG. Intent and goals of international agencies (such as the United Na tions [UN] or North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]). Applicable ROE, to include their intent and the specifically e numerated provisions."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 V ISUALIZE U NFORESEEN C IRCUMSTANCES 4-7. Commanders and their planners must be able to vi sualize and act upon unfore seen circumstances. To accomplish this, they must have a clear understanding of the charter and goals of the total U.S. effort. Although it is impossible to predict every situation an d write specific ROE or CO As to address them, an executing element that understands the commander’s inte nt can respond with rapid flexibility to unforeseen and unplanned circumstances. R ECOGNIZE P OLITICAL I MPLICATIONS 4-8. UW has a political end state. Every act, from advising military activ ities to an informal conversation, carries with it the potential for political impact. ARSOF planners should not anticipate a conventional environment that is dominated by traditional military concerns that are separate from a political context. Whether conducting UW as an independent ARSOF operation or in conj unction with conventional forces, ARSOF planners must consider both the short- and lo ng-term political implications of proposed action. F ACILITATE I NTERAGENCY A CTIVITIES 4-9. UW, both by definition and actual implementation, is an interagency effort in which military operations represent only one part—and not always the most important part—of th e overall U.S. program. ARSOF must be aware of all agencies comprising the UW effort. ARSOF may also act as the liaison between the irregular organizations, U.S. agencies, and other DOD components to ensu re the achievement of synergy. When participating in an interagency (and often joint) effort, ARSOF must strive for unity of effort and recognize the difficulty in achieving it. ARSOF must also antic ipate ambiguous missions, conflicting interests and goals, and a disunity of effort. E NGAGE THE T HREAT D ISCRIMINATELY 4-10. The ARSOF commander must know when, where, and how to employ assets base d upon short- and long-term objectives. During UW efforts, this imperative contains thre e key components for the ARSOF planner: selection and distribution of resources; traini ng, advice, and assistance; an d tactical considerations. Selection and Distribution of Resources 4-11. The first component of engaging threats discriminately involves the sele ction and distribution of resources for both personnel and materiel. Appropriateness, not mass, is the standard. ARSOF commanders must ensure that units selected for the mission are capable, qualified, trained, and nece ssary for the effort. The desired outcome is to minimize the U.S. presence while maximizing the U.S. impact in realizing objectives. Training, Advice, and Assistance 4-12. The second component of engaging threats discriminately is selecting what tr aining, advice, and assistance to provide. Because resources are normal ly limited in a UW envi ronment, ARSOF must use them wisely for best effect. Based upon ARSOF understanding of the ope rational environment and its complex internal dynamics, ARSOF must carefully select which particular training to provide and advice to offer. Commanders must consider the impact that trai ning and advice will have against the threat, as well as the political implications of the type of assistance provided to fo reign nationals. Tactical Considerations 4-13. The third component of engaging threats discrimina tely deals with tactical considerations. ARSOF must carefully target tactical operations in UW to ensure success and avoid alienating the civilian population."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-3 C ONSIDER THE L ONG -T ERM E FFECTS 4-14. UW efforts are typically long-term affairs; however, such operations can al so result in a dramatic regime change in a relatively short period. Planners must analyze cond itions in the UWOA and the irregular forces involved, and they must understand higher HQ’s intent and the overall operational scheme. This analysis enables planners to effectively dete rmine the anticipated duration of operations and to adequately plan for linkup operations and the transition of irregular e lements. ARSOF units must recognize that the operational scheme may be nonmilitary in nature. 4-15. Planners should consider each problem in its broa der political, military, and psychological context. ARSOF units often must allow for legal and political constraints to a void strategic failure while achieving tactical success. They must not jeopardize the success of long-term th eater goals with the desire for immediate, short-term success. Policies, plans, and operations must be consis tent with U.S. national and theater priorities and the objectives that they support. E NSURE L EGITIMACY AND C REDIBILITY OF S PECIAL O PERATIONS 4-16. Significant moral and legal considerations often exist in a UW effort. Legitimacy is the most crucial factor in developing and maintaining international and interna l support. Without this support, the United States cannot sustain assistance to an irregular fo rce. Without recognized legitimacy and credibility, military operations do not receive the support of the indigenous population, t he U.S. population, or the international community. A NTICIPATE AND C ONTROL P SYCHOLOGICAL E FFECTS 4-17. All operations and activities in a UW environment have significant psychological effects. Combat operations and civic action programs are two examples of the type of operations or activities with obvious psychological effects. ARSOF may conduct some opera tions and activities specifically to produce a desired psychological effect. A negative ps ychological impact may overshadow or negate a tactical victory. Recognizing that perceptions may be more important than reality in the UW arena, ARSOF must strive to ensure that all audiences understand operations. Losing control of perceptions may result in a distortion of facts and may even diminish or destroy the gains of even superbly planned and e xecuted missions. A PPLY C APABILITIES I NDIRECTLY 4-18. The role of ARSOF in UW is to advise, train, an d aid irregular forces. The area commander typically assumes primary authority and responsibility for the su ccess or failure of this co mbined effort. Successful U.S.-advised operations reinforce and enhance the legitimacy and credibility of the area command and irregular forces. UW is fundamentally a political activity to persuade surrogates to act in concert with U.S. objectives, which is an indirect application of U.S. power. D EVELOP M ULTIPLE O PTIONS 4-19. ARSOF elements engaged in a UW operation must recognize and prepare for possibl e contingencies and follow-on missions. ARSOF personnel must plan to use their range of expertise, eve n if not specifically tasked to do so. A change of operational environment may dictate a change of mission or ROE. ARSOF maintains operational flexibility by visualizing and developing a broad range of options and concept plans, thereby enabling personnel to shift from one option to another before and duri ng mission execution. E NSURE L ONG -T ERM S USTAINMENT 4-20. ARSOF involved in a UW effort must avoid advising or training the irregular forces in techniques and procedures that extend beyond the forces’ sustainment capabili ties. For example, planners may modify U.S. TTP (including tactical communications, demolitions, we apons systems, and logistics) to negate the threat and allow for training programs and equipment that are durable, consis tent, and sustainable by the irregular forces."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 P ROVIDE S UFFICIENT I NTELLIGENCE 4-21. Intelligence forms the basis for all UW activities a nd programs. UW operations depend upon detailed and comprehensive intelligence on all aspects of the operational environment and its internal dynamics. Commanders establish the priority of effort when th ey identify intelligence requirements. ARSOF in a UW environment often use classified techniques to acquire intelligence that identifies the enemy’s locations and intentions for future operations. However, not all threats may come from an identifiable enemy. ARSOF should consider the nonmilitary thr eats posed by the civil sector, such as criminal ac tivities, hazardous materials, civil unrest, and disease. The knowledge gained through intelligence collection activities enables ARSOF to effectively advise, train, and employ the irregular force. Effective operations security (OPSEC) requires an alert organization that can assess the hos tile threat, warn the unit, and take timely action to penetrate and neutralize the hostile effort. B ALANCE S ECURITY AND S YNCHRONIZATION 4-22. ARSOF elements performing a UW mission can often provide significant help to ot her SOF and conventional forces in accomplishing their missions. In order to address s ecurity concerns, SO often operate in a compartmentalized manner; however, compartmentaliza tion must allow for key personnel to participate in the planning process. Although insuff icient security may certai nly compromise a mission, excessive security will usually cause the mission to fail (primarily because of inadequate face-to-face coordination). Leaders must constantly strive to achieve an effective bala nce of security and mission-planning synchronization. M AINTAIN F ORCE P ROTECTION 4-23. FP during UW is similar to that during any other operation or deployment; FP is a mission enhancer—not a mission. The ARSOF commander’s FP plan normally includes a ll actions—ranging from standard antiterrorism items to medical and sanitation issues t o tactics used in the field—that ensure the forces’ ability to achieve mission success. ARSOF lead ers, however, usually face a unique challenge in maintaining FP because of the operational environm ent and the (typically) sm all size of the element conducting UW. USSOCOM Directive 525-4, Antiterrorism (FOUO) , and United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) Directive 525-13, Plans and Operations—Force Protection (FOUO) , provide an outline of FP requirements. The size of the ARSOF element, mission requirements, and guidance from higher HQ dictate the methods and techniques used to ensure adequa te FP while achieving mission success. Some of these TTP are classified. FM 3-05.220, (S/NF) Special Forces Advanced Special Operations (U) , provides a detailed explanation of these TTP. SEVEN PHASES OF UNCO NVENTIONAL WARFARE 4-24. Each application of UW is unique, particularly when applied against nonstate actors. However, U.S.-sponsored UW efforts generally pass through the following seven dis tinct phases: Preparation. Initial contact. Infiltration. Organization. Buildup. Employment. Transition. 4-25. Some of the phases may occur simultaneously or—in certain situations—not at all. For example, a large and effective resistance movement may require only logistical support, th ereby bypassing the organization phase. The phases may also occur out of sequence, with each recei ving varying degrees of emphasis. One example of this is when members of an irregular force are e xfiltrated to a partner nation (PN) to be trained and organized before infiltratin g back into the UWOA, either with or without the ARSOF unit. In this case, the typical order of the phases would change."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-5 P HASE I: P REPARATION 4-26. USG activities that deliberately alter or shape the potential o perational environment enhance the GCC’s war plans, OPLANs, and contingency plans. Every UW situation is unique, but all instruments of U.S. national power can potentially play a role in influencing and shaping t he UWOA as part of a UW campaign. Much of the ARSOF role in such shaping activities is cl assified. (FM 3-05.201 contains further information on this subject.) Integrated USG UW “preparation of the environment” (PE) activities can create or affect local, regional, and global conditions that are beneficial to future UW operations. PE happens globally and continuously (outside of and be fore a UWOA is officially designated). Once the USG designates an area as a UWOA, PE may expand. 4-27. The preparation phase for UW is part of a three-step process that consists of intelligence preparation of the operational environment (IPOE), war planning , and shaping activities. First, IPOE attempts to graphically represent the current reality and predict probable enem y COAs in the UWOA. Second, war planning describes future military operations. Third, shaping activiti es work to modify the UWOA to make it more conducive to all types of future operations. 4-28. The preparation phase must begin with a complete IPOE. This phase includes a thorough analysis of the local populace and, if applicable, the irregular force’s strengths, weaknesses, logistic concerns, levels of training and experience, political or military agendas, factional relationships, and external political ties. ARSOF units must consider the roles of DIMEFIL elements—the instruments of U.S. national power— when planning the employment of UW. Developing a systems perspective of the AO t hrough a systems analysis can facilitate understanding of complex enviro nments in which UW occu rs. In addition to this data, analysts should complete a thorough area study of the AO. This area st udy should include (but is not limited to) issues regarding politics, religion, economic s, weather, living standards, medicine, education, government services, and so on. Once planners initially assess the UWOA, participating ARSOF elements ensure that the joint force commander (JFC) is awar e of ARSOF capabilities to shape the UWOA, and they recommend interagency participation in the effort as appropriate. P HASE II: I NITIAL C ONTACT 4-29. Ideally, a pilot team should make initial contact with an estab lished or potential irregular element. However, there may be occasions wh en the infiltrating ARSOF unit make s initial contact. A pilot team is typically a preplanned, ad hoc, interagency element composed of indiv iduals possessing specialized skills. During contact, pilot team personnel begin the assessment of the po tential to conduct UW in the UWOA and the compatibility of U.S. and local interests and objectives with the UWOA . This procedure not only allows for an accurate assessment of UW capability in the UWOA but also arra nges for the reception and initial assistance of additional ARSOF elements, typically an SF unit. If deemed necessary, the theater special operations command (TSOC) may arrange to exfiltrate an asset from the UWOA to brief the ARSOF elements during planning. Once the theater command or TSOC d etermines the feasibility of developing the area, the President or SecDef may dir ect the infiltration of additional ARSOF elements. The pilot team may then remain with thes e follow-on units or may exfiltrate. P HASE III: I NFILTRATION 4-30. During this phase, the ARSOF units infiltrate the UWOA. Infiltration may be as overt as using a chartered civilian flight or as discreet as a cl andestine insertion. Missi on requirements—along with mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available–time available and civil considerations (METT-TC)—determine the most desira ble method of infiltration. After infiltration, the ARSOF unit links up with the pilot team or irregular force. Because the infiltration phase is not complete until the initial entry report is sent to the unit’s higher HQ, the ARSOF unit must submit this rep ort as soon as possible upon infiltration—even if they fail to contact the irregula r force. Immediately upon infiltration, the ARSOF unit continues the area assessment initiated by the pilot team to confirm or refute the previously received information. The ARSOF unit must continue to report all relevant operational information to higher HQ."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 P HASE IV: O RGANIZATION 4-31. During the organization phase, the ARSOF unit begins to develop the capability of the irregular force. Depending on the size and scope of the ARSO F effort, the size of this force can range from one individual to a resistance element of potentially an y size. Planners traditionally conceive UW with an emphasis on guerrilla warfare. Such efforts may enta il the organization of large guerrilla units to conduct combat operations, and SF are specially designed to organize such elements. However, re sistance or insurgency is not solely a guerrilla warfare effort. Th e organization of resistance or insurgent elements may involve other ARSOF personnel with PSYOP, CA, or other skill sets. Although each irregular force or organization in UW is unique, the traditional ARSOF practice of conceiving UW as U.S. support to an insurgency or resistance movement provides a unifying general concept for irregul ar force organizational structure. Although support for classic insurgency or resistance against state opponents may be less common in the 21st century, ARSOF retain this capab ility and use this traditional unifying concept as a reference template against which ARSOF Soldiers are assessed, trained, and employed in UW. The Components of an Insurgency 4-32. ARSOF units subdivide an insurg ency into three components—guer rillas, underground, and the auxiliary. These elements are designed to be— Self-sufficient and self-contained. Capable of centralized command but decentralized execution. Redundant, in the event th at the enemy destroys a portion of the element. 4-33. The insurgency support mechanisms need to remain hidden in order to survive. For this reason, they remain partially compartmentalized, dispersed, and fluid. The organization mu st constantly adapt to the changing security environment and avoid establishing predictable patterns . Elements are organized—not according to any template—based upon the needs of the region. 4-34. The overall insurgent organization or resistance group is not referred to as a military unit; rather, the element is titled an “area command.” This label indicates the focus of organizational upon an area or region and—unlike traditional military units—is not based upon a specifi c number of personnel. For this reason, the overall indigenous commander is doctrinally refe rred to as the area commande r. Subordinate commands within an area command are known as sector co mmands. These subordinate commands encompass all elements within their resp ective areas. This decentralization allows the sector commands to control all of the functions required to operate independently while maintaining t he ability (rather than the necessity) to centralize or coordinate operations with the area command. 4-35. The area command is not a separate physical node like the three standard compon ents of the insurgency (Figure 4-1, page 4-7). The area command is instead integrat ed throughout these components at all levels of the irregular organization. The area co mmand is made up from the leadership cells of the underground, auxiliary, and guerrillas, as well as me mbers of ARSOF (most typically SF) when present in the UWOA. Many of these leaders ma y function as deliberate or de fact o leaders of a shadow government within the UWOA or as a government in exile if it exists. Key movement leaders who provide strategic political direction may also be identifiable in the shadow govern ment or government in exile. 4-36. The three components of the insurgency do not nece ssarily represent three distinct groups or units; they more accurately describe three types of individuals within the or ganization. All three components provide different functions that support the overall goals of the organizati on. The size of the components will vary according to the unique conditions present in each UWOA. For example, in urban environments the ratio of underground and auxiliary personnel to guerrillas may be much high er than is true in rural environments. The Guerrillas 4-37. Guerrillas represent the most commonly recognized portion of the in surgency. They are a group of irregular, predominantly indigenous personnel organized along military line s to conduct paramilitary operations in enemy-held, hostile, or denied territory. Guerrillas carry out mos t of the armed conflict that openly challenges the regional authority."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-7 Figure 4-1. Classic components of an insurgency in an unconventional warfare operational area The Underground 4-38. The underground is a cellular organization within the irregular movement that is responsible for subversion, sabotage, intelligence collection, and ot her compartmentalized activities. Most underground operations are required to take place in and around po pulation centers. As such, the underground must have the ability to conduct op erations in areas that are usually inaccessibl e to the guerrillas, such as areas under government military control. Underground members ofte n fill leadership positions, overseeing specific functions that auxiliary workers carry out. The u nderground and auxiliary—although technically separate units—are, in reality, loosely connected elements th at provide coordinated capabilities for the irregular movement. The key distinction between them is that the underground is the el ement of the irregular organization that operates in areas denied to the guerrilla force. S pecific functions of the underground and auxiliary include the following: Control of intelligence and CI networks. Control of clandestine movement networks. Direction and coordination of PSYOP and IO against the government, the pop ulation, and the international community. Direction and coordination of urban cells used to conduct acts of sabotage. Operation of the command structure or shadow government, if present. Control of cells used to neutralize informants and collaborators. The underground and auxiliary typically conduct this activity to meet the tactical necessi ty, as well as to serve as a deterrent to other members of the population that may be co nsidering collaboration with the enemy. Such activities are normally coordinated with the CI and PSYOP cells. 4-39. Underground members are sometimes considered the “professional revolutionaries” of an irregular movement. They may be indigenous or professionals from another country. The unde rground members sometimes operate using a false identity and are less likely to be ac tive members of the community, whereas auxiliary members most often tend to live “double lives” b y providing part-time support and still acting as actual members of the community. Governme nt suspicion often forces auxiliary workers to abandon their normal lives within the community. These individuals are typically well suited to become part of the guerrilla force or to serve as undergroun d members in charge of other auxiliary workers who can still function within the community. 4-40. Undergrounds are more likely in urban environments where the proximity a nd concentration of adversary forces make overt irregu lar operations more dangerous. The underground performs its functions in urban environments by operating in small, co mpartmentalized cells and by utilizing “safe houses,”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 apparently innocent houses or premises established by an organizatio n for the purposes of conducting clandestine or covert activity in relative security. Members condu ct activities with a minimum of contact between personnel and in such a manner as to not draw attention to unusual activity. The core underground cadre members survive by maintainin g secrecy, compartmentalizing information, and having their auxiliary workers assume the majority of the risk. The Auxiliary 4-41. The auxiliary is the primary support element of the irregular organization whose organization and operations are clandestine in nature and whose members do not openly indicat e their sympathy or involvement with the irregular movement. This support enables the guerrilla force—and often the underground—to survive and function. This support can take the form of logistics, labor, or intelligence. Although many functions of the auxiliary and underground overlap, auxiliaries are more likely in rural environments where the relative distance and dispersion of adversary force s permit operations by guerrilla or other armed irregular forces. Members of the au xiliary are sometimes characterized as “part-time members” of the irregular organization, continuing to participate in the life of th eir community—to all appearances concerned only with their normal occupa tions—and at the same time engaging in irregular operations to varying degrees. Local cell or element l eaders organize and coordinate all efforts, which the area or sector command directs. These various elements may serve as support cells within compartmentalized support networks. Specific functions of the auxili ary include— Managing logistics. Providing security and early warning (rural and urban). Conducting CI. Conducting intelligence gathering. Recruiting personnel. Conducting PSYOP (to include subversion). Running safe houses or portions of networks. The Mass Base 4-42. Finally, although not traditionally considered a component of a U.S.-spon sored insurgent or resistance movement, the larger indigenous population from which the irregular forces are drawn must be an organizational consideration. UW is an elemen tal IW activity; as such, influence over a relevant population is critical. Communist insurgents of the 20th century refe rred to the general population (in a UWOA) as the “mass base.” Insurgent leaders tasked elements of the underground with infiltrating civil institutions and manipulating popular grievances and overt ind igenous political activities to support insurgent objectives. Many of these activities, such as strikes, labo r unrest, food riots, and so on may be effective methods of combating and weakening the adversary government, without being di rectly associated with the insurgent effort. The participants in such mass-popular activities may be unaware that of their manipulation by and for the insurgent moveme nt. Therefore, practitioners of UW cannot consider these participants a direct part of the insurgent organization. However, practitioners should take the insurgency’s use of these participants in a U.S.-s ponsored UW effort into account as an adjunct organizational factor. Therefore, UW leaders must continuously emphasize t he maintenance of influence over this group. Other Organizational Considerations 4-43. ARSOF personnel establish rapport with the local leadership by demonstr ating an understanding of, a confidence in and a concern for the group and its cause. If necessary, ARSOF units explain their capabilities and limitations and begin the development of th e organization. During subsequent operations, the ARSOF unit may have to prove its value in actual operations. Buil ding rapport is a difficult and complicated process that is based largely on mutual trust, confidence, and understanding; it is rarely accomplished overnight. 4-44. During the organization phase, larger irregular orga nizations require more detailed work than smaller groups. Before a larger irregular or ganization can successfully engage in operations, the leadership must"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-9 organize an infrastructure that can sustain itself and withstand t he anticipated hostile reaction by opposing forces. During this phase, the leadership may identify a cadre that will serve as the organizational nucleus during the buildup phase. The ARSOF units assist the leadership in conducting the cadre training program to prepare for the eventual buildup of the organization. 4-45. When working with an irregular element, the local leader a nd ARSOF unit commander must agree upon C2 arrangements. ARSOF personnel normally advise and assist counterpart irregular leaders. In some situations, ARSOF members may actually direct some activities. 4-46. The specifics of the irregular organization depend upon local conditions a nd USG requirements. UW requires centralized direc tion and decentralized execution under conditions th at place great demands on the organization and its leadership. No two irregular orga nizations will require the same degree or level of organization. The ARSOF unit commander should consider the followi ng factors when advising any irregular leadership regarding organization: Effectiveness of the existing organization. Extent of cooperation between the or ganization and the local populace. Hostile activity and security measures. Political boundaries, natural terrain features, potential targets, popul ation density, and other characteristics of the UWOA. Religious, ethnic, political, and ideological diff erences among elements of the population and competing organizations. Proposed type and scope of UW operations. Degree of U.S. influence with the irregular organization. 4-47. Although the classic and unifyin g conceptual template of AR SOF UW remains support to insurgency, resistance, or conventional military operations, not all instanc es of UW operations fit neatly into this concept. In the 21st century, UW conducted by, with, or through irregu lar forces, such as the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan or the united Kurdish fo rces in northern Iraq, still fits the classic concept well. Other UW operations, however, such as those conducted in support of FID, COIN, or other IW activities (as mentioned in Chapter 1), or those conducte d in nonbelligerent states or ungoverned territories are more organizationally counterintu itive. Just because ARSOF have the capability to train, advise, and assist sizeable irregular forces and organizations in hostile or denied areas, does not mean that ARSOF UW must be conducted only in such areas and only with large elements. Espec ially in the context of combating global terrorism, a UWOA may be large and not entirely inside hostile or denied t erritory, and UW organizations can be very small or diffuse. 4-48. Circumstances may dictate that certain members of the irregular force b e exfiltrated from the immediate UWOA to a designated safe haven or PN. Once there, they may organize, train, and coordinate with other elements before reinsertion. This traine d cadre may more effectively form the core for the established infrastructure. P HASE V: B UILDUP 4-49. The buildup phase involves the expanding of the irregular elements and th eir capabilities to meet mission objectives. ARSOF unit tasks include infiltra tion or procurement of equipment and supplies to support this expansion and subsequent operations. During the buildup phase, the AR SOF unit assists the cadre in expanding into an effective organization that is capable of condu cting operations. Because successful missions lead to increas es in recruitment, leaders should initially select confidence targets— those with a high probability of success and low risk to the irregular force. Ir regular force missions and tactics normally dictate a simple, mobile, and flexible organiza tion that is capable of rapid dispersion and reconsolidation in response to the tactical situati on. Each unit is normally self-contained, with its own intelligence, communications, and logistics systems. 4-50. UW planners need to consider th e appropriate level of capability an d then balance the intended size of irregular forces against the requirement for a re duced signature. This focus should be on the capability required for the mission, not on the size of the force. As an organization gr ows, it creates a larger signature, thereby degrading the ability to conduct clandestine operations. If the irregular force begins noticeable"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 operations too early, opposition forces may concentrate efforts on the irregula r force and diminish their chances of mission success. 4-51. In some instances, such as with the Northern Alliance in Afghanist an in 2001, this phase may be relatively short. In such cases, th e buildup phase mainly consists of coordinating with the preexisting resistance organization, developing combined standing operating proce dures (SOPs) and fire control measures, and then moving directly to the sixth phase—employment. P HASE VI: E MPLOYMENT 4-52. During the employment phase, indigenous or other irregular forces increasingly operate in a combat or hostile environment. These operations build in scope and size to support the objectives of the area command (if applicable) and the theater commander. The ARSOF unit ens ures that effects of the activities continue to support the goals of the theater commander. These operations range from interdiction wit h guerrilla forces designed to drain the hostile power ’s morale and resources through combat to active intelligence collection with an indigenous informant network. Re gardless of the type of operation, the overall purpose is to achieve strategic political-military objectives. Even when the UW operation involves combat actions, such combat employment does not necessarily require ARSOF units to be physically engaged in combat. It involves the c onduct of operations in a combat or hostile environment. In addition, planners may use irregular forces to achieve objectives without direct U.S. participation. 4-53. When UW operations are in support of MCO of conventional forces, ARSOF must give careful attention to the capabilities of irregular forces and to coordination and deconfliction of such UW operations with theater objectives. UW forces can indirectly support conventi onal operations through interdictions and diversions throughout their UWOA or more directly support conventional movem ent by providing security of routes, drop zones (DZs), beach landing sites, and so on. Planners must carefully coordinate any subsequent linkup between irregula r and conventional forces. Following successful linkup, UW forces may potentially continue to support conventional MCO thr ough such activities as reconnaissance, rear area security, or support to CMO. P HASE VII: T RANSITION 4-54. Transition is the final, most difficult, and most sensitive phase of UW operations. The planning for transition begins when the USG decides to sponsor an irregular or ganization and ends in the UWOA upon cessation of hostilities or operations. Transition does not nece ssarily mean demobilization or the commencement of FID operations. However, it usually re quires some form of stability operations. Some SF units may focus continuing UW efforts on providing se curity with their irregular counterparts to begin conducting FID operations. Other ARSOF units may also continue to conduct UW activities in support of a larger FID mission. CA will usually play a leading role in transition by facilitating assistance from nonmilitary organizations. Preplanned PSYOP themes will explain HN (and, directly or indirectly, U.S.) goals and enhance compliance by population groups in the UWOA. 4-55. Civilian USG agencies, along with international organizations and agencies, such as the UN, normally assist in the transition of any organized military groups. A RSOF units may help these agencies conduct transition, using their knowledge of both the terrain and the forces w ithin the UWOA. The manner in which transition occurs affects the postwar attitudes of the pe ople and the government toward the United States. The greatest transition danger is the possib ility that former resistance members may resort to subversion of the new government, factional disputes, or banditry. The ne w government brings arms and ammunition under its control to ensure public security and to return to a functional civil structure based on the rule of law. The government helps former resi stance forces integrate into the newly reconstituted national army, police forces, or other security forces or assists their ret urn to previous occupations. The new government must make every effort to reorient fo rmer resistance members to a peaceful society and to gain their trust. UNCONVENTIONAL WARF ARE TERMINATION OF OPERATIONS 4-56. The nature of the termination will shape the futures of the conte sting nations or groups. It is essential to understand that termination of operations is an e ssential link between national security strategy, national"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-11 defense strategy, national military strategy, and the national strate gic end state. Furthermore, other military operations and USG activities will normally continue after the conclu sion of any UW combat operations. An extended U.S. presence is required to conduct stab ility operations to enable legitimate civil authority and to attain the national strategic end state. Planners must a ddress the consideration of stability operations at the initiation of UW planning and must continually update the UW plan during execution. Historically, stability operations have required extended U.S. presence and assistan ce. Planners should consider this contingency during the initial COA development and execution recomme ndation. T ERMINATION A PPROACHES 4-57. There are three approaches for achieving national strate gic objectives by military force. The first is to force an imposed settlement by the threat to occupy —or the actual occupation of—an enemy’s territory and domination of his land, resources, and people. The threat or actual occupati on of the territory can be supported by destruction of critical functions and assets (such as C2 or infrast ructure), which makes the adversary unable to resist the imposition of U.S. will. 4-58. The second approach seeks a negotiated settlement through coordinated p olitical, diplomatic, military, and economic actions that convince an adversary that yieldi ng will be less painful than continuing to resist. Negotiating power in armed conflict springs fr om three sources: national resolve, military success, and military potential. History has demonstrated that U.S. national resolve is the most important source of negotiating power when impressing upon an adversary the need to neg otiate a conclusion to conflict. Military success provides military, geographic, political, psychological, or economi c advantage and sets the stage for negotiations. Military potential may compel the opposi ng nation or group to consider a negotiated conclusion. Negotiating an advantageous conclusion to operations requir es time, power, and the demonstrated will to use both. In addition to imposed and negotiated termination, there may be an armistice or truce, which is a negotiated intermission in opera tions, not a peace. In effect, it is a device to buy time pending negotiation of a permanent settlement or resumption of operations. 4-59. The third approach for ach ieving national security objectives in relation to the irregular challenges posed by nonstate actors is an indirect approach th at erodes an adversary’s pow er, influence, and will; undermines the credibility and legitimacy of its po litical authority; and undermines the adversary’s influence with, control over, and support by the indigenous population. 4-60. Even when pursuing an imposed termination, the USG requires some means of communication with the adversary. Declarations of intentions, requirements, and minor concessions ma y speed conflict termination, as the adversary considers the advantages of early termination versus extended resistance. 4-61. An adversary’s will and freedom of action affect s termination. Once the adversary’s strategic objective shifts from maintaining or extending gains to reducing lo sses, the possibilities for negotiating an advantageous termination improve. The USG needs to coordinate the effort s of all the instruments of national power toward causing and exploiting such a shift. The USG must conside r termination of operations from the outset of planning. Termination should be a coordinat ed interagency, IGO, NGO, and multinational effort that is refined as opera tions move toward advantageous termination. T HE N ATIONAL S TRATEGIC E ND S TATE 4-62. The first political task regarding termination is de termining an achievable national strategic end state based on clear national strategic objectives. For situations that require t he employment of military capabilities (particularly for anticipated major operations), the Pre sident and SecDef will establish a set of national strategic objectives. Achieving these objectives i s necessary to attain the national strategic end state—the broadly expressed DIME conditions that should exist after th e campaign or operation. The supported CCDR must work closely with the civilian leadership to ensure a c learly defined national strategic end state is determined. Thinking of this “end st ate” as an integrated set of aims is useful because national strategic objectives usually are closely relate d rather than independent. The supported CCDR often has a role in achieving more than one national strategic objective . Some national strategic objectives will be the primary responsibility of the supported CCDR, while others will require a more balanced use of all instruments of national power, with the CCDR in support of other agencies. Ther efore, considering all of the objectives necessary to reach the national strategic end state w ill help the supported CCDR formulate"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 proposed termination criteria—the specified standards ap proved by the President or SecDef that must be met before a joint operation can be concluded. Comm anders and their staffs must understand that many factors can affect national strategic objectives, possibly causing the national strategic end state to change even as military operations unfold. M ILITARY C ONSIDERATIONS 4-63. In its strategic context, the measure of military su ccess is in the attainment of military objectives supporting the national strategic end state and associated termination criteria. Termination criteria for a negotiated settlement will differ significantly from thos e of an imposed settlement. Planners should review military strategic advice to civilian leadership regarding terminat ion criteria for military feasibility, adequacy, and acceptability, as well as estimates of the ti me, costs, and military forces required to reach the criteria. Implementing military commanders should reques t clarification of the national strategic end state and termination criteria from higher authority when nece ssary. An essential consideration is ensuring that the longer-term stabilization and enabling of civil authority need ed to achieve national strategic objectives continues upon the conclusion of sustained operations. Stabilit y operations that support SSTR efforts primarily support OGAs, IGOs, and NGOs to restore civil authority; rebuild the infrastructure; and reestablish commerce, education, a nd public utilities. Leaders should initiate planning for these operations when the joint operation planning process begins. The JFC and staff should cons ider conducting early collaborative planning with interagency and multinational me mbers, harmonizing the civil and military effort and establishing the appropri ate organization to conduct operations during the “stabilize” and “enable civil authority” phases of stability operations. ARMY SPECIAL OPER ATIONS FORCES 4-64. USASOC is the Army Service component command of USSOCOM. The term ARSOF refe rs to the United States Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) (USASFC[A]), w hich consists of five Active Army SF groups and two ARNG groups, the 75th Ranger Regiment, the 16 0th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) (4th POG[A]), the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) (95th CA BDE[A]), and the Sustainmen t Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne) (SB[SO][A]). 4-65. SF, the 4th POG(A), and the 95th CA BDE(A) are un iquely trained within the DOD to work with irregular forces against a hostile government or nonstate actor. Th erefore, SF, the 4th POG(A), and the 95th CA BDE(A) are the ARSOF that c onduct UW, while the SOAR and SB(SO)(A) support UW operations. The 75th Ranger Regiment does not conduct UW but may support UW indirectly as part of the JFC’s overall campaign plan. FM 3-05.20 and FM 3-05 contain more information on SF.

SF is the ARSOF element traditionally and most clos ely associated with th e execution of UW. SF Soldiers and units at all echelons of C2 contribute to the ARSOF UW effort . Special Forces Operational Detachment A 4-67. Although it is capable of a wide range of ARSO F core and supporting missions, the U.S. Army designed the SFODA to organize, equip, train, advise or direct, and support irregular forces engaged in UW activities. The SFODA is the classic signature element in th e conduct of ARSOF UW. While the SFODA typically conducts the majority of direct interface with irregular for ces within the UW OA, it represents only the “tip of the iceberg.” Only after significant and detailed planning, coordination, and approval at all levels of military and civilian decision making, is the SFODA actually employed in UW. After infiltration and throughout the conduct of UW, the SFODA benefits from the collec tive UW expertise from the SF command structure employed in support of the operation. This usually includes , at a minimum, an SF"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-13 battalion operating as a special operations task force (SOTF), an SF group operat ing as a JSOTF, and a TSOC operating as a joint force sp ecial operations component command. ARSOF UW in Afghanistan The joint special operations task force (JSOTF) UW campaign to topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was led by ARSOF. Combat operations on the ground were primarily dominated by 5th Special Forces Group SFODAs supporting the anti-Taliban leaders in th e north, northeast, and s outh. PSYOP teams prepared leaflets, broadcasts, and a boots-on-the-gr ound video presented nationwide, and CA teams coordinated humanitarian relief to the Afghan population. As the cities fell to anti-Taliban forces, tactical PSYOP teams and CA teams were attached to SFODAs. The 160th SOAR aircrews supported these UW operations by inserting teams, guarding insertions, and conducting surgical ai r raids that required multiple aerial and ground refuels in extremely bad weather. Precursor elements of the SB(SO(A) supported all ARSOF elements in the conduct of their UW op erations. The 75th Ranger Regiment supported the overall camp aign by assaulting airstrips for use in follow-on operations. JSOTF-North at K2 Uzbekistan, which was commanded by an SF colonel, developed the UW campaign plan, daily directed offensives in a constantly evolving operation, orchestrated Army and Air Force SOF assets into combat multipliers, and successfully fought the war to overthrow the Taliban in less than two months. Weapon of Choice: ARSOF in Afghanistan 4-68. The time-tested composition of the SFODA remains as viable and relevant to UW today as it has been throughout the history of SF. The commander of an SFODA is a captain. His two primary assistants are an assistant detachment commander (an SF warrant officer) and an operations sergeant (a master sergeant). The SFODA has one intelligence serg eant and two noncommissioned officers (NCOs) specializing in each of the four primary SF fu nctional areas (weapons, engineer, medical, and communications). This structure represents a highly capable SO unit with sig nificant expertise and redundancy. 4-69. The SFODA has many functions pertinent to UW. It can— Plan and conduct SF operations separately or as part of a larger force . Conduct operations in remote areas and hostile environments for extend ed periods with a minimum of external direction and support. Infiltrate and exfiltrate specified operational areas by air, land, and sea. Each SFODA trains in an additional specialty, such as underwater operations, military free -fall parachuting, SF military mountaineering, surface maritime operations, an d vehicle operations. These specializations provide varied means of infiltration into denied or sensitive areas . Develop, organize, equip, train, and advise or direct irregular forces up to batt alion size. Although the primary focus is on developing the irregular force’s combat capability, members are also capable of training selected individuals in unit staff functions. Train, advise, and assist other U.S. and multinational forces and agen cies. Plan and conduct unilateral SF operations or other SO activities as direct ed. 4-70. The SFODA provides the majority of effort within the UWOA. During UW against a standing government, the SFODA will often train and advise ex isting irregular organizations, as well as conduct combat operations with such groups. Examples of such efforts include OEF, whic h resulted in the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 20 01–02, and the UW efforts with the Kurds in northern Iraq during OIF in 2003. In other cases, members of SFODAs can conduct shaping operations to prepare an area for future UW efforts against adversary states and nonstate actors, s uch as terrorist organizations. Many of these shaping TTP are classified. FM 3-05.201 addresses these TTP in detail."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-14 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Special Forces Company 4-71. When the UW operation expands beyond the capability of the employed force to synchronize the overall effort or involves more elements than can be effectively controlled, the SF company HQ (or Special Forces operational detachment B [SFODB]) can serve as a C2 or operational element. As an area C2 element, it commands and coordinates the effort of SF ODAs and other assets in the area. The company can also function in a manner similar to that of an SFODA—training, advising, and condu cting combat operations with a larger UW organization, especially when the experience and ra nk of the company-level personnel are required. Special Forces Battalion 4-72. The SF battalion, also known as the SOTF, provide s the employed forces with the functions of a standing staff, sustainment assets, and C2 capability to both support and direct UW operations. The battalion provides a significant capability to collect, anal yze, and disseminate intelligence; coordinate and direct operations and operational support; coordinate and execute logistic s; and provide signal support. The commander and his staff use their extensive experien ce and expanded situational awareness to execute battle command specific to UW the SFODA or company cannot mat ch. In unique situations, the battalion staff may act as a separate operating element with the C2 of subordinate SF ODAs and SFODBs retained with the battalion rear element. Special Forces Group 4-73. The SF group constitutes the largest combat element of ARSOF. The S F group is an extremely flexible organization designed to have self-contained C2 and support ele ments for long-duration missions. SF groups and their subordinate elements are regionally oriented, experience d, language-qualified, and specifically organized and trained to command and control UW. The group st aff officers represent an integrated mix of Army branches. These officers are predominately senior SF officers with theater expertise. They are uniquely suited to conduct and provide oversight for the operat ions process for UW. When tasked by the TSOC, the SF group can form the co re for a JSOTF. The commander of the JSOTF is a JFC. He exercises the authority and responsibility assi gned by the establishing TSOC. The SF group that is assigned the role of JSOTF synchronizes the actions of the joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and military elements involved in a UW operation in support of the JFC’s cam paign. P SYCHOLOGICAL O PERATIONS 4-74. JP 1-02 defines PSYOP as “planned operations to convey selected info rmation and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, a nd ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.” The mission of PSYOP i s to influence the behavior of foreign TAs to support U.S. national objectives. 4-75. In the full range of military operations, PSYOP take on an added significanc e. Modern conflict is often a protracted political-military struggle between politi cal systems. It often encompasses all spheres of national activity—political, military, economic, social, and cul tural. In protracted operations (including most UW campaigns), noncombat activities can be as decisive as combat operations are decisive in conventional warfare. Sometimes, failure to achieve PSYOP objectives can mean defeat, regardless of the outcome of combat operations. 4-76. In modern conflict, emphasis on the psychological or informational objective places PSYOP in a unique position. During stability operations, the USG can use PSYOP uni laterally or with economic, social, and political activities to limit or preclude the use of military force. In some cases, the military objective may be relevant only in terms of the psychological effect. History has shown that conflict is a battle of wills in which the intangible nature of morale and willpower can be defeated more in psychological terms than in physical terms. 4-77. PSYOP forces are a critical component of UW operations. The USG begins PSYOP a s far in advance as possible. When commanders properly employ, coordinate, and integrate PSYOP u nits, these units can significantly enhance the combat pow er of resistance forces during UW operations directed against a state"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-15 or nonstate entity and support the overall U.S. effo rt during each phase of UW employment. PSYOP units help prepare the resistance organization and the civilian population to accept U.S. sponsorship. 4-78. Leaders must identify, request, and integrate PS YOP requirements during the initial planning phase of the UW operation. PSYOP requirem ents will vary according to the specific UW situ ation; the security classification of the product or act, th e status of the PSYOP as overt or covert, the types of media used, and so on. One of the most important roles of PSYOP for ces during preparation for a UW campaign is aiding in the analysis of the UWOA from a PSYOP perspective and conducting detailed analysis of potential TAs, to include potential allies and enemy forces. The target audience analysi s (TAA) may aid in the identification of potential leaders in the irregular force and iden tify lines of persuasion to bolster support for the movement among sympathizers an d the uncommitted populace. The TAA also identifies lines of persuasion that create a desired behavior change among hostile forces and their sympathizers. TAAs identify key leaders, communicators, and groups, as well as their vulnerability and accessibility to future PSYOP products. 4-79. The following PSYOP events take place during UW campaign planning: PSYOP objectives are developed to support the comma nder’s objectives. Product approval processes are designed and approved. PSYOP programs are approved by the President or SecDef. Supporting PSYOP products are developed. 4-80. PSYOP objectives are typically oriented around the following general t opics: Creating popular support for the resistance movement. Developing support of the populace to allow the friendly forces freedom of movement. Promoting the recruitment of othe rs into the resistance movement. Discrediting the existing government or hostile nonstate actor. Discrediting external supporters of adversary governments or nonstate a ctors. Maintaining suppor t of the indigenous populace for the U.S. presence. Dividing and inducing defection among hostile forces. Winning the support of uncommitted population groups and key individuals. Preserving and strengthening friendly civilian support. Developing unity within the irregular force. Maintaining motivation within the irregular force. 4-81. Once the President or SecDef appr oves the operation’s ex ecution, forces execute the planned PSYOP UW operations. PSYOP forces immediately begin monitoring the program. In a U W environment, psychological actions may have a greater impact than at other times sim ply by harnessing and building upon preexisting feelings of frustra tion within the populace toward the existing gov ernment or nonstate actor. Potential psychological actions must undergo detailed, deliberate pla nning and assessment for effectiveness and risk to U.S. objectives. However, judicious use of PSYOP in UW can prove decisive. C IVIL A FFAIRS 4-82. CAO are conducted by forces organized, trained, and equipped to provide specializ ed support to commanders conducting CMO. CMO are op erations that involve the interac tion of military forces with the civilian populace. In all operations, commanders must consider not only military forces but also the nonmilitary environment in which they operate. ARSOF conduct UW wit hin and rely on foreign populations, which greatly magnifies the importance of ARSOF CAO in UW. CAO typically assist SF in the establishment and running of infrastructure, which provides impo rtant support services to the irregular organization. This human environment includes a ci vil populace that may be su pportive, neutral, or antagonistic to the presence of m ilitary forces, both friendly and op posing. A supportive populace (and auxiliaries) can provide material resources that fac ilitate friendly operations, as well as a positive moral climate that confers advantages on the military and diplomatic acti vities ARSOF pursue in achieving foreign policy objectives through UW. A hostile popul ace threatens the immediate operations of deployed ARSOF. It also often undermines public support at home for U.S. policy obj ectives."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-16 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 4-83. ARSOF CA conduct CAO to establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relati ons between military forces and civil authorities (gov ernment and nongovernment) and th e civilian populace in a friendly, neutral, or hostile AO to facilitate military operations and to consolidate operational objectives. Judicious use of CA as part of an integrated UW campaign can thus have psychological impa ct, which can improve the effectiveness of other UW activities. For exampl e, the psychological perception by selected targeted audiences in the UWOA that U.S.-sponsored irregular organizations are responsive to their needs can be decisive in winning popular support. CA forces may assist in the perfor mance of shadow government activities and functions by military forces that would normally be the responsibility of a legitimate local government. They may also occur, if directed , in the absence of other military operations. 4-84. Although CAO may support all phases of UW, in situ ations where irregular organizations transition into a new government, the most important role of CAO is usually facilitating the swift transition of power from the resistance forces to a legitimate government after the ces sation of hostilities. 4-85. CAO are an integral part of ARSOF UW campaign planning from the beginning; they are not an afterthought. CA forces may also assist SF units in planning and execut ing UW operations by— Advising ARSOF units in cultural, political, and economic considera tions within the UWOA. Assessing the impact of proposed missions upon the local populace. Advising ARSOF units on the development of irregular organizations and the expa nsion of the UWOA by gaining and maintaining popular support. Assisting irregular forces to develop infrastructure and conduct populace and res ources shaping (PRS) operations. Assisting ARSOF units in integrating with OGAs (DOS and USAID, for example). Advising and assisting in planning, coordinating, and establishing of dislocated civilian camps. Advising ARSOF units in planning measures to gain support of the civilian populace. Planning mobilization of popular support to UW operations. Analyzing the impact of irregular organizations on indigenous populations and institutions (IPI) and centers of gravity through CA input to the IPB. Providing the supported commander with critical elements of civil information to support effects-based approaches and to improve situa tional awareness and understanding within the battlefield. Advising ARSOF units and irregular forces on the development of civil administra tion within the UWOA as a legitimate government begins to operate. Gaining access for development into otherwise restricted or denied are as. SUPPORTING ELEMENTS AND ACTIVITIES 4-86. Other ARSOF elements can perform vital roles during the conduct of UW. The situation and unique requirements during each UW operation dictate the participants and their required contributions. However, almost all SO (including UW) require communications, logistics, health, an d (usually) aviation support. ARSOF have organic units that routinely support these requirements. (Chapter 8 in cludes an expanded discussion of ARSOF supporting elements and activities for UW.) INTERAGENCY ACTIVITIES 4-87. OGA, both within and outside of the USG, may perform vital roles during the conduct of UW. The situation and unique requirements during each UW oper ation dictate the participants and their required contributions. 4-88. During the conduct of UW, ARSOF units often work in conjunction with (or in close proximity to) personnel from other USG agencies. This relationship is normally nondoctrinal; the two elements generally provide mutual support without any formal tactical control (TACON) or op erational control (OPCON) relationship. Mission planning at the TSOC or JSOTF typi cally establishes the details of this cooperation."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Planning Considerations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 4-17 4-89. Interagency coordination occurs between agencies of the USG to accomplish an objective. Military operations must be coordinated with the activities of OGAs, IGOs, N GOs, regional organizations, foreign forces, and various HN/PN agencies. 4-90. The JFC may choose to draw on the capabilities of other organization s, provide the joint force capabilities to other organizations, or merely deconflict the j oint force activities with those of other agencies. Interagency coordination forges the vital link between the mil itary and other U.S. instruments of national power. Successful interagency, IGO, and NGO coordination enab les the USG to build international support, conserve resources, and conduct co herent operations that ef ficiently achieve shared goals. 4-91. When deliberate or crisis-action planning is re quired, the degree to which military and civilian components can be integrated and harmonized bears directly on the efficiency and succ ess of the collective UW effort. Because a solution to a problem seldom resides within the capability of a single agency, campaign plans and OPLANs must be crafted to recogn ize the core competencies of many agencies. The military activities and resources should be coordinated with their counterparts in other agencies to achieve the desired end state. 4-92. Relationships between the armed forces and OGAs, IGOs, and NGOs do no t equate to C2 of a military operation. Military operations depend upon a command structur e that is different from that of civilian organizations. These differences may present significa nt challenges to coordination efforts. The different—and sometimes conflicting—goals, policies, procedures, and dec ision-making techniques of the various USG agencies make unity of effort a challenge. 4-93. In addition to extensive USG agency coordination, commanders must also fully integrate operations into local efforts when appropriate. Such integration requires close coordination with local government agencies and bureaus; local military , paramilitary, or police forces; and multinational partners. A structure, such as a mixed military working group, made up of senior officials of the m ilitary and other agencies may assist such an effort. If appropr iate, these working groups may also incorporate belligerent parties. T HE N ATURE OF I NTERAGENCY B UREAUCRACY 4-94. Each agency has core values and legal requirements that it may not compromise. In any interaction, all participants must be constan tly aware that each agency will cont inuously cultivate an d create external sources of support and maneuver to protect its core values. Individual agency pers pectives and agendas complicate policy development. Protection of institutional pr erogatives may often drive the various USG agencies’ positions. These positions may not alwa ys coincide with a common approach to UW. 4-95. As uncertainty increases during a crisis, so does the likelihood of compromi se. Compromise may bring the sacrifice of power, secur ity, or prestige. Uncertainty allows for the coexistence of varying views about the likely outcomes of a given action; these di fferences in viewpoint often lead to conflicting interests. An organization will seek to reduce uncer tainty and lessen the threat to its own stability. Information can reduce uncertainty and increase an organization’s power . Thus, information equals power in interagency coordination, because it provides those who possess it a de cided advantage in the decision-making process. Maintaining unity of effort in complex, someti mes contentious, and often long-term UW interagency campaign planning is a coordination challenge for ARSOF execution of UW. U NITED S TATES G OVERNMENT I NTERAGENCY P LANNING FOR U NCONVENTIONAL W ARFARE 4-96. USG support to a UW campaign will include the complete range of DIMEF IL functions to strengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of irregu lar forces and those actors who support them directly or indirectly. The appropriate balance among the functions will vary depe nding on the situation. The leadership should thoroughly assess the environment before planning and co ntinuously evaluate the environment throughout the course of the UW effort to determine the balance of functions. Agencies’ and departments’ day-to-day reporting, assessments, evaluations, and othe r activities support the decision-making process leading to the conduct of a joint, interagenc y analysis."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 4-18 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 4-97. A “whole-of-government” approach to a UW engagement begins with a strategic -level joint and interagency analysis of the manifesting or escalating conflict through USG s upport for irregular forces engaged in insurgency, resistance, or otherwise supporting U.S. conven tional operations. ARSOF need to participate in this strategic-level joint analysis by all other relevant members of the interagency to ensure an integrated response. Dynamics that drive and mitigate conflict are complex and interrelated. Diplomatic, development, or military action alone cannot address these dynamics. Independe nt analyses by individual agencies are likely to identify only the symptoms of co nflict that the individual agency can address outside the whole-of-government context and without concern for the prioritiza tion and sequencing of efforts by other agencies. 4-98. Policy-level/strategic planning can use conflict assessments tha t utilize tools and modeling, such as the Interagency Methodology for Analyzing Instability and Conflict and Polit ical Instability Modeling, to develop situation-specific information. This first step provides a me chanism for prioritizing a whole-of-government engagement. Conflict assessments using tools such a s USAID’s Conflict Assessment Framework, Tactical Conflict Assessment Framework, and other agency and department assessment and modeling tools can then inform programmatic, operational- and tactical-level design and planning. 4-99. When the USG decides to use ARSOF to conduct UW, ARSOF facilitate interagency understanding of ARSOF capabilities and solicit support from the interagency to a chieve the mission. Any interagency conflict assessment must analyze the entire conflict. General steps in the performance of an interagency conflict assessment include— Articulation of the purpose, audience, and de liverers of the assessment. For example, an interagency group may conduct the assessment to establish a basis for inte ragency strategic planning in support of U.S.-sponsored and ARSOF-executed UW. Collection of data (through field-based activities or secondary sources resi dent in or accessible to each USG department and agency). This data will regard the UWOA and other actors capable of influencing the UWOA and will include background factors and underl ying risks, stakeholders’ interests and needs, opinion leader s’ motivations and means, and potential action triggers in an integrated UW campaign plan. If a preexisting irregular force is present, data collection should specify links between the abov e categories and the supported irregular force. Description of the dynamics present within the context of the observed bac kground factors— stakeholders’ needs, opinion leaders’ motivations and means, politic al causes, demographic trends, and so on that contribute to the existe nce and potential utility of the irregular force to U.S.-sponsored UW. Identification of the adversary’s local and regi onal capacity and resilience to combat the U.S.-sponsored irregular force. For example, the legitimacy of the adversary state and the effectiveness of its political, social, economic, and security institut ions; attitudes of the civil society by subgroup; and international and regional factors. 4-100. Once interagency planners ma ke these assessments, they can identify the ability—or lack thereof—of U.S. instruments of national power to shape conditions in the U WOA. While ARSOF execute UW as part of the U.S. military instrument, it is impor tant that the interagency assist the JFC in identifying which other U.S. instruments of power he can use as weapons in a holisti c UW campaign plan."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 5-1 Chapter 5 Special Forces Operations INTRODUCTION 5-1. Although each application of UW is unique and a wide range of efforts can make up UW as a whole—including nonlethal or even nonmilitary activitie s, the classic centerpiece is the introduction of military advisors into hostile and denied territory to or ganize, train, equip, and ad vise armed irregulars. The U.S. military specifically designed SF groups, battalions, companies, and S FODAs to conduct these operations. However, a large body of traditional and updated TTP already exists for SF conduct of UW. Consistent with the conceptual purpose of this uncl assified manual, this chapter is deliberately brief. FM 3-05.201 contains more information on SF conduct of UW. NOTE: Some of the following phases may occur simultaneously or—in certain situations—not at all. PHASE I: PREPARATION 5-2. The preparation phase for UW is part of a three-step process that consis ts of IPOE, war planning, and shaping activities. First, IPOE attempts to graphically represent the current r eality and predict probable enemy COAs in the UWOA. Second, war planning de scribes future military ope rations. Third, shaping activities work to modify the UWOA to make it more conducive to all types of future operations. 5-3. The preparation phase must begin with a complete IPOE. When directed to prepare for UW, the SF group staff, supported by higher ARSOF echelons and the resources of the IC , conducts a thorough analysis of the local populace and, if applicable , the irregular force’s strengths, we aknesses, logistic concerns, levels of training and experience, political or military agenda s, factional relationships, and external political ties. Depending on projected authorities, scope of employmen t, support requirements, and designated timelines for execution, the SF group may assign focused preparation responsibiliti es to its subordinate battalions and companies. SF units at all echelon s must consider the roles of DI MEFIL elements when planning the employment of UW. Development of a systems perspective of the AO, through a system of systems analysis, can facilitate understanding of complex UW environments. In addition to this data, the S FODAs complete a thorough area study of the projected UWOA. This area study should include (but is not limited to) issues regarding politics, religion, economics, weather, living standards , medicine, education, and government services. 5-4. As war planning proceeds to preparation for execution of UW, SF groups and battalions take all operational steps for predeployment, deployment, employment, opera tional sustainment, survivability, C2, and redeployment of themselves, their subordin ate staff elements, SF companies, and SFODAs. 5-5. Once preparers complete the initia l UWOA assessment, participating SF elements apprise the JFC of SF capabilities to shape the UWOA and recommend interagenc y participation in the effort as appropriate. Much of the SF role in such shaping activities is classified. (FM 3-05 .201 includes further information.) Integrated USG UW preparation activities can create or affect local, regional, and global conditions that are beneficial to future UW operations. PHASE II: INITIAL CONTACT 5-6. Ideally, a pilot team makes initial contact with an establish ed or potential irregular element. The intent of pilot teams is to make initial liaison with irregular elements within the UWOA to coordinate and establish plans and procedures for subsequent friendly infiltration and the conduct of future UW activities. Since most UWOAs are in denied and hostile territory, the presence and ac tivities of the pilot team usually"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 5-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 represent a hazardous and often politically sensitive mission. A sta ndard SFODA can function as a pilot team when directed. However, since each UW missi on will have unique characteristics specific to the situation, SF groups commonly establish temporary ad hoc pilot teams from group perso nnel. This arrangement is often desirable because it allows the SF group to us e the broad range of skills, experience, and language and theater expertise resident in the regionally oriente d SF group. SF Soldiers typically lead such teams. However, the team may include PSYOP, CA, intelligence, or other Soldiers with relevant expertise. Teams can also expect to have particip ants from OGAs. Moreover, given the interagency nature of ARSOF UW, it is equally common for SF Soldiers to augment pilot team s led by and primarily constituted of OGA personnel. 5-7. The pilot team assesses the potential of the UWOA and gains rapport with the irregular force. The time needed to accomplish these tasks depends on the operational environment, th e maturity and numbers of irregular forces, and the tactical situation. Once approved by the TSOC for further development, the pilot team plans and coordinates for the reception, staging, onward movement, and integrat ion of all follow-on detachments infiltrating the UWOA. PHASE III: INFILTRATION 5-8. The success of an SFODA’s inf iltration of a designated UWOA depends primarily on detailed planning and preparation. Procedures and techniques for employing any one of the fo ur general methods of infiltration will be dependent on certain factors being pr esent that will enhance the success of the mission. Depending upon the situation, the SFODA may need to use a number of these methods concurrently. A IR I NFILTRATION 5-9. Air delivery by parachute is one of the principle m eans available for the infiltration of SFODAs. In most instances, standard troop carrier aircraft are well equipped and satisfy airdrop requirements. Some situations may dictate a requirement for aircraft capable of parachute delivery of pe rsonnel and equipment from high altitudes using free-fall parachute techniques or static-line stabilization chute descent to low altitude. In addition, assault-type aircraft, as well as amphibious and utility types, used by several Services may be available in varying numbers. Some situations may require that these aircraft be able to use relatively short, unprepared airstrip s and to conduct air-landing operations during infiltration. Under certain circumstances, longer-range tactical aircraft may be used. W ATER I NFILTRATION 5-10. ARSOF may frequently employ water infiltration by either unde rsea craft or surf ace craft in UWOAs with exposed coastlines, coastal river junctions, and harbors. Water infi ltration using seaplane landings on large bodies of water, rivers, or coastal waters may be possible. In such case s, planning by the commander considers the ship-to-shore movement and subsequent land-movement charact eristics of a normal water-infiltration operation. L AND I NFILTRATION 5-11. ARSOF may conduct land infiltration similar to that of a long-range tactical patrol into enemy territory. Generally, units utilize guides during land inf iltration. If guides are not available, the unit must have detailed intelligence of the route—particularly if borders are to be crossed. The unit selects routes that take maximum advantage of cover an d concealment and avoid enemy outpo sts, patrols, and installations. Units may also conduct infiltration through an intricat e irregular support mechanism. Planners will provide the unit with the location and means of contacting selected indi viduals who will furnish assistance. These individuals may be used as local guides and provide information, food, transport ation, and shelter. Commanders may restrict equipment and supplies to individual arms and communi cation equipment. However, the situation may allow the use of additional transportation opti ons from indigenous pack animals and low-visibility vehicles to various tactical vehicles in the SF inventory. Their utilization will allow the infiltration of additional oper ational equipment with the detachment."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Special Forces Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 5-3 S TAY -B EHIND I NFILTRATION 5-12. Stay-behind infiltration is the easiest method to accomplish and one of the most valuable when the adversary has the potential of occu pying the area with armed forces. St ay-behind infiltration involves the positioning of SFODAs within the proposed UWOA before the initiation of enemy advances through or occupation of the general area. This technique enables the SF elements to organize a nucleus of resistance forces or to pre-position themselves for employment in a unilateral ro le. Planners should consider stay-behind operations when the attitude of the civil populace indi cates it will support stay-behind operations. PHASE IV: ORGANIZATION 5-13. Although each irregular force or organization in UW is unique, the tra ditional SF practice of conceiving UW as U.S. support to an insurgency or resistance movement provi des a unifying general concept for irregular force organizational structure. SF traditionally conc eive UW with an emphasis on the conduct of guerrilla warfare. Such efforts may entail the organization of large guerrilla units to conduct combat operations, and the U.S. military designed SF units to organize such eleme nts. However, resistance or insurgency is not solely a guerrilla warfare effort . The organization of resistance or insurgent elements may involve other ARSOF personnel with PSYOP, CA, or other skill sets. FM 3-05.201 contains detailed information on SF UW. 5-14. The SFODA’s initial requirement is the establishment of a good work ing relationship between SF and the irregular elements in the UWOA. A sound working and command relationship helps to develop a high degree of cooperation and some degree of control over the irregular force. S F abilities to build trust and to carefully persuade the irregulars to act in c oncert with U.S. objectives strengthen relative control over the irregular force. SF Soldiers further build trust and relative control by providing organizational leadership skills and assets that help the irregular organization to meet its objectives in a manner that supports the overall plan. S PECIAL F ORCES O RGANIZATION OF THE A REA C OMPLEX 5-15. Developing the command structure and the physical organization of the UWOA are priority tasks of SF units. In some situations, the organization of the UWOA may be well established. In others, organization and C2 may be incomplete or absent. In all cases, some improvement in physical area organization will probably be necessary. SF units are ad ept at being flexible and creative in developing such irregular organizations. A number of requirements dictate the organization of t he UWOA, but the organization depends more on local conditions and U.S. political-mi litary objectives than on any fixed set of rules. Major factors to be considered include— The effectiveness of the area command. The degree of irregular organization overall effectiveness. The degree of guerrilla or armed irregular force organization and effectiveness. The extent of cooperation between the irregula r organization and the larger civilian populace. The activities and effectiveness of the enemy or adversary. The degree of development desired and achievable in the context of U.S. objec tives. The limitations and opportunities present in the human and physical environments . 5-16. All of these factors in combination will influence in varying degrees the shape, size, and ultimate organization of the UWOA. Regardless of the size of the area or exte nt of U.S. efforts, SF units conducting UW assist the area command in organizing its operati onal elements to achieve dispersion, control, and flexibility. 5-17. SF organization of the area complex consists of both the physical and human components of the irregular organization. Physical co mponents of the area complex typically include guerrilla operational base safe areas, security and intelligence systems, communi cation systems, mission support sites (MSSs), supply installations, training areas, DZs, landing zones, reception sites, and evasion and escape mechanisms, as required. The area complex is not prim arily a continuous pattern of tangible installations, but a series of intangible lines of communication connected to all ot her irregular elements in a clandestine manner."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 5-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 5-18. SF units also have capabilities to support the organization of th e area complex’s human components, especially in conjunction with ARSOF PSYOP and CA units. ARSOF may direct considerable activity during this period toward creating a political and psychological climate that encourages irregular participants (or potential participan ts) to accept personal risks in suppo rt of the irregular force’s cause. With discriminating SF support of proper area command leadership, the real or potential elements of the irregular organization will grow la rger, become better trained and eq uipped, and will cooperate more effectively in achieving the organi zation’s objectives. Organizational growth occurs when natural leaders— such as former military pers onnel, clergy, local office holder s, educators, and neighborhood representatives—emerge, providing th e area command with a potential cad re resource on which to plan the growth and expansion of the irregular organization, armed forces, and opera tional environment. 5-19. Regardless of how developed or underdeveloped the irregular organization is initially, primary consideration should be given to ensuring that certain basic functions and operations exist. If they do, ARSOF should improve upon and organize them as need ed. If they do not exist, ARSOF should put them into effect immediately. These functions are not established separatel y, but may be established concurrently and developed as required. The organization establishe d to perform them directly affects the following functions: Performing unit or element organization. Providing security and intelligence systems. Operating communications systems. Operating administrative systems. Operating logistical support systems. Providing training programs. Planning and executing combat operations (violent activities). Planning and executing political activities. Expanding the irregular organization and its constituent elements. S PECIAL F ORCES O RGANIZATION AND THE C OMPONENTS OF AN I NSURGENCY 5-20. As discussed in Chapter 4, the classic template for conducting UW as support for resistance movements or insurgencies—whether for their own ob jectives or in support of conventional military operations—remains a pertinent and unifying concept for how SF can begin to organize any irregular organization. The Area Command 5-21. Working through the irregular force’s area command and subordinate sector co mmands (as detailed in Chapter 4), SF Soldiers organize and develop the various components of an insurgency (or similar irregular organization). SF Soldiers’ special attributes, training, experi ence, and preparation make them particularly well suited for the persuasive human inte raction required for this task. The larger the UWOA and the more expansive the UW effort, the more likely that higher echelon s of SF will participate in developing and advising the area command, potentially involving SF comp anies, battalions, or groups. The Guerrillas 5-22. Guerrillas, or similar armed forces, represent the most commonly recognized portion of an insurgency and the portion most commonly associated with the warri or skills of participating SF Soldiers. They are a group of irregular, predominantly indigenous personnel that organize along military lines to conduct paramilitary operations in enemy-held, hostile, or denied territ ory. Guerrillas carry out most of the armed conflict that openly challenges the regional authority. 5-23. In classic guerrilla scenarios, armed units could be formed into squad, platoon, company, battalion, and even regiment size. Once again, the more expans ive the UW effort, the more likely that more SFODAs will be employed and that SF companies, battalions, or even groups will participate in advising and leading larger irregular armed forces. SF Soldiers have traditiona lly been able to impart military training to these elements appropriate to the situation. The unique structure and cap abilities of the SFODA provide a"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Special Forces Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 5-5 training cadre capable of unit development from basic individual training up t o and including advanced and combined tactical training at the battalion level. Since SF members are professional combat Soldiers comprised predominantly of senior enlisted leaders, they can not only train irregular units but also advise and lead them in tactical operations. The Underground 5-24. There is more SF participation in developing and advising underground elements th an is widely understood or acknowledged. Most such participation is classified and inappropriat e for inclusion in this manual. The Auxiliary 5-25. There is more SF participation in developing and advising auxiliary ele ments than is widely understood or acknowledged. Most such participation is classified and inappropriat e for inclusion in this manual. The Mass Base 5-26. SF participation in the creation of effects within th e mass base to shape the operation environment is done indirectly and primarily through the underground and auxiliary. Most such participation is classified and inappropriate for inclusion in this manual. 5-27. Organization of the larger indigenous population from which the irregular forc es are drawn—the mass base—must likewise be conducted primarily by the irregular organization itself under indirect guidance of SF. The primary value of the mass base to UW operations is les s a matter of formal organization than of marshalling population groups to act in specifi c ways that support the overall UW campaign. The mass base, or general population and societ y at large, is recognized as an operational rather than a structural effort for ARSOF in UW. Elements of the mass base are divided into three distinct groups in relation to the cause or movement—pro, anti/con, and those who are uncommitted, undecided, or ambivalent. ARSOF, the underground, and the auxiliary then conduct irregula r activities to influence or leverage these groups. These groups may be witting or unwitting of the UW nature of the operations or activities in which they are utilized. PHASE V: BUILDUP 5-28. The buildup of forces is counterproductive if the irregular force does not obtain enough resources to support and sustain the buildup. These resources include weapons, munitions, medical supplies and services, internal and external support for rations, as well as an expanded intelligence apparatus to ensure force protection and targeting abilities. The buildup phase involve s SF units assisting the irregular organization to expand the capabilities of its component elements as re quired for mission objectives. SF unit tasks include infiltration or procurement of eq uipment and supplies to support this expansion and subsequent operations. During the buildup phase, the SF unit assists the irreg ular force cadre in expanding into an effective organization that is capable of c onducting operations. Because successful missions lead to increases in recruitment, leaders should initially select confidence targets—those with a high probability of success and low risk to the irregular force. Irregula r force missions and tactics normally dictate a simple, mobile, and flexible organization that is capable of rapid dispersion and reconsol idation in response to the tactical situation. Each unit is normally self-con tained, with its own intelligence, communications, and logistics systems. 5-29. UW planners need to consider the appropriate level of capability a nd balance the intended size of irregular forces against the requirement for a reduced signature. This focus shou ld be on the capability required for the mission, not on the size of the force. As an organization gr ows, it creates a larger signature, thereby degrading the ability to conduct clandestine operations. If the irregular force begins noticeable operations too early, opposition forces may concentrate efforts on the irregula r force and diminish their chances of mission success."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 5-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 5-30. The traditional SF standard for building an insurgent organization is that one SFODA can raise, train, equip, and advise one guerrilla battalion. The redundancy provided b y an SFODA’s manning structure can allow small elements to conduct split-team or smaller subeleme nt SF placement with widely dispersed irregular forces. However, when the UWOA is large or larger irregular forces are present (or needed) and appropriate or when complex operations, such as modern urban underground ope rations are involved, SF manpower requirements may increase. SF companies, ba ttalions, and groups are all deployable and capable of providing training, advice, and assistance to large irregular organizations as nee ded. The U. S. military may infiltrate additional SF units during the buildup phase and may attempt to further “force multiply” by selecting and training additional indigenous cadres capable of supporting a gr owing irregular force. Sustainable buildup of an irregular organization may take a long time to achie ve when conducted under effective pressure from adversary forces or may be relatively short if the irregular organization and its forces are already well developed. PHASE VI: EMPLOYMENT 5-31. During the employment phase, SF units support indigenous or other irregular f orces conducting operations against the common adversaries of irregular organizations and the Unit ed States. Such operations may involve any or all components of the irregular organization. The class ic conception of UW employment is SF Soldiers advising and assisting guerrilla forces to raid, ambush, sabotage, and otherwise interdict the adversary in ways designed to drain that hostile power’s mo rale and resources through military activities up to and including combat. 5-32. Not all SF employment of irregular elements necessarily involves direct combat, how ever. SF Soldiers are adept at leveraging active intelligence co llection with an indigenous informant network. The intelligence thus collected can support SF’s conduct of the UW effort itse lf, and it can sometimes be of strategic value to a holistic USG effort against state or nonst ate adversaries. SF units, usually in conjunction with irregular elements, can also establish safe areas, sites, and procedures as part of an unconventional, assisted-recovery mechanism useful to the evasion and recovery of S OF or conventional personnel, such as downed pilots. SF can also employ classified TTP by, with, and through the clandestine and covert capabilities of the underground and auxiliary to conduct holistic warfare against a wide range of hostile state and nonstate actors. 5-33. Regardless of the type of operation employed, the overall purpose is to achieve st rategic political-military objectives. The U.S. Army specially sel ects, trains, equips, and pr epares SF Soldiers to persuade irregular forces to act in concert with such U.S. strategic polit ical-military objectives. Even when the UW operation involves combat actions, such combat employment does not necessarily require the SF units to be physically engaged in combat. It invol ves the conduct of operations in a combat or hostile environment. In addition, the USG may use irregular forces achieve objectives without direct U.S. participation. 5-34. When forces conduct UW operations in support of MCO of conventional forces, SF groups, battalions, companies, and SFODAs ensure that UW for ces properly integrate into the conventional JFC’s campaign plan. Since SF units understand both the capa bilities of U.S. forces and irregular forces within the specific conditions of a unique UWOA, these SF echelons are uniquely positioned to coordinate and deconflict irregular force operations with theater objec tives. SF units conduct UW operations by, with, or through irregular forces to indirectly support conventional operations through interdictions and diversions of adversaries throughout the UWOA. SF units train, advi se, and assist irregular forces to directly support conventional movement by providing security of routes, DZs, beach landing sites , and similar missions. When appropriate, SF companies can establish a special operations C2 element attached to conventional division or corps HQ to further assist in coordinating and deconflicting UW operations with those of conventional forces. 5-35. Link-up operations are pa rticularly hazardous, even among el ements of the same army. Linkup between foreign irregular forces and conventional forces are even more difficult. SF units’ familiarity with the UWOA and expertise with irregular forces atte mpting linkup greatly mitigate the risks of any such subsequent linkup between irregula r and conventional forces. Following successful linkup, UW forces may potentially continue to support conventional MCO thr ough such activities as reconnaissance, rear area security, or support to CMO. SF units’ continuing suppo rt of such irregular force conduct of these activities"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Special Forces Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 5-7 provides enhanced cross-cultural communication, intelligence-gathering opportunities, effective coordination of assets, and reduces the risk of fratricide. PHASE VII: TRANSITION 5-36. Transition does not necessarily mean the end of hostilities or SF operations in the UWOA. Some SF units may focus continuing UW efforts by providing s ecurity with their irregular counterparts to support stabilization efforts and the beginning of FID operati ons. SF units will also likely assist civilian USG agencies, international organizations and agencies, an d any new government with integrating the remaining irregular forces into the newly reconstituted national army, police forces, or other security forces or assisting with their return to previous occupations. Depending on the quality of rapport built with irregular forces in earlier phases, this relationship uniquely situates SF units to assist OGA and HN civil authorities in transitioning these irregular forces.

PSYOP support of UW should begi n as early as possible. Typically, the psychological battle will begin before commitment of U.S. military PSYOP forces. Before commitment of U.S. PSYOP support to the UW operation, elements of the guerrilla forces or the underground may have begu n an embryonic PSYOP program or at least begun to examine the psyc hological effects they wish to generate. In some cases, such irregular forces may have a more developed PSYOP program than t hey have combat capacity. In other cases, the situation facing ARSOF PSYOP personnel may be one of guerrilla forces or the underground having no PSYOP program whatsoever. In addition, they may have alrea dy made mistakes in attempts at conducting PSYOP or they may even have conducted military or ot her operations that have alienated potential supporters. All ARSOF personne l must begin UW operations mindful of the ARSOF imperative that anticipating and controlling the psychological e ffects are going to be either a key enabler or a critical shortfall. NOTE: Some of the following phases may occur simultaneously or—in certain situations—not at all. PHASE I: PREPARATION 6-2. It is important that planners identify, request, and integrate requirements for PSYOP f orces during the planning phase of an operation. PSYOP forces and the supported un it must embrace the concept that no matter what type of operation PSYOP support, th e PSYOP process does not change. What changes from operation to operation is the security classification of support, the overtness or covertness of the PSYOP, and potentially, and the types of media used. PSYOP forces’ most important role d uring the preparation phase of the operation is aiding in the analysis of the environment from a psyc hological perspective and conducting detailed analysis of potential TAs, to in clude potential allies as well as enemy forces. TAA can aid in the identification of potentia l leaders of the insurgent force and identify PSYOP arguments that will help bolster support for the insurgency among sympathizers and the uncommitted populace. TAA als o identifies PSYOP arguments that will aid in creating a desired behavior change among enemy forces and enemy sympathizers. TAA will identify the vulnerabilities of key le aders and communicators and groups and their accessibility to future PSYOP series. 6-3. It is during this phase that Psychological Operatio ns objectives (POs) are developed to support the commander’s objectives, product approval processes are designed and approved, supp orting PSYOP documents are developed (estimates, annexes, and tabs), and PSYOP programs are approve d by the President or SecDef. POs may be oriented around the following genera l topics: Creating popular support for the insurgency movement. Developing support of the populace to allow the in surgents to avoid detection and move freely. Promoting the recruitment of othe rs into the resistance movement. Discrediting the existing government and its programs. Introducing or delineating a shadow government or government in exile. Maintaining support of the indigenous populace for U.S. support and presence. Dividing and inducing defection among enemy forces. Winning the support of the uncommitted. Preserving and strengthening friendly civilian support. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 6-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Developing unity among the UW force. Maintaining motivation in the UW force. 6-4. Once PSYOP are authorized, PSYOP forces will ex ecute and monitor planned programs and series supporting PE. In a UW environment, Psychological Operations actions (PSYACTs) can have a greater impact than at other times simply by harnessing and building upon preex isting feelings of overall frustration of the populace with regard to the exis ting government. PSYACTs in corporated into a PSYOP series must undergo detailed, deliberate planning to war game potential outco mes of the activity. For example, a planned demonstration can easily turn into a riot when emotions run high. Whether this occurs deliberately or spontaneously can affect the potential outcome. War gam ing allows forces to plan for different outcomes, protect the appropriate parties, and achiev e the desired objective from the goal. F ORMAL L AUNCH 6-5. Typically, the movement sponsored by the United States in a UW effort is a lready in existence. However, the movement may be highly generaliz ed and perhaps conducted by several different organizations. If the effort to oppose an adversary during UW has some sort of benc hmark date or event, such as the anniversary of a general strike or an excess crackdown by the governme nt, this date may be of psychological value in formally launching an insurgency. 6-6. In addition, if two or more groups join in common cause and form a united front, the date of this event may be exploitable. Formation of a united front may include the formal declara tion of a government in exile or some form of early shadow government organization. These organizations may or m ay not have been in existence before a formal launch and therefor e may have preexisting conditions or may be a blank slate. The former may present cons iderable challenges to overcoming perceptions of inertia or even incompetence. The latter may present cha llenges of establishing the a government in exile that is viable an d credible. PSYOP forces may disseminate series in support of this government in exile as early as Phase I or may merely conduct research for later use. Typically, fo rces would do this in Phase IV as the UW effort becomes increasingly viable militarily. 6-7. The declaration of a movement or escalation of resistance (particular ly if the government has not yet faced armed resistance) by a key communicator can provide psychological ince ntive to the UW effort. Planners must base any formal launch of a new movement or a reinvented movement on careful analysis of the key TAs. A formal launch of the UW effort with PSYOP series can be counterproductive if they will generate unrealistic expectations in TAs. Therefore, ARSOF forces may need to caution irregular forces against such a COA. Example of Forming a United Front The example of the Patriotic Union of Ku rdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in Iraq points out both the benef its and pitfalls of a formal launch of a new “united front” of former ly combative groups. Before OIF, the PUK and KDP had a long history of conflict. In May 1994, support ers of the PUK clashed with supporters of the KDP leaving 300 people dead. Rela tions among the groups further soured in March 1995 when the KDP backed out of an attack on Saddam’s fro nt lines led by the Iraqi National Congress. Over the ne xt year, the PUK and KDP fought several more times, eventually devolving into a state of civil war. At the start of OIF, both the KDP and PUK worked alongside ARSOF units in northern Iraq aga inst what had always been a common enemy in Saddam Hussein. PSYOP and public diplomacy supported the unification of the former rivals. In 2004, the KDP and PUK, along with several smaller Kurdish a nd one ethnic Turkoman party, united to form a joint polit ical coalition, the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan (DPAK). This alliance clearly constituted a formal launch of the latter stages of a UW effort. Initially, this formal launch bore political fruit with the winning of 75 seats in the Iraqi Council of Representat ives. In addition, the KDP and "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Psychological Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 6-3 PUK were able to secure the selection of Jalal Talabani (the PUK leader) as President of Iraq, while Massoud Barzani (t he KDP leader) became President of Iraqi Kurdistan. In May 2006, the KDP formed an alliance with the PUK to run Irbil as a unified party. However, relations have since soured again, with northern Iraq effectively divided into KDP-controlled territory and PUK-controlled territory (centered on Suleymaniya). In 2006, a reconstituted DPAK that still contai ned both the PUK and KDP tempered this deterioration. This particular case highlights the inher ent challenge in UW of persuading human actors to operate in concert with U.S. ob jectives. The breakdown of a union that was earlier launched an d championed through PSYOP and public diplomacy was useful despite later complications; the union contri buted to the overall success of the UW effort in northern Iraq. Moreover, as ARSO F efforts transition more to FID operations, this breakdown can be couched in PSYOP and public diplomacy term s as the normal functioning of a democratic process in which parties do not alw ays agree. C ONSTANT C OURSE 6-8. In UW, the forces battling an adversary frequently emerge from debates and issues that have degenerated into armed conflict. In most cases, ce rtain themes and symbols will already resonate with current and potential sympathi zers, supporters, or recruits. If so, rath er than any change in themes or any new formal launch of a resistance movement, the most effective approach may be to “stay on message” and continue to use the themes and symbols that have resonated before the escalation to a UW effort. In addition, a careful PSYOP assessment may reveal gaps in knowledge of the vul nerabilities or accessibility of TAs that require further study of the type of PSYOP programs or inadvertent PSY OP that any antigovernment organizations or key communicators have put out. If the impact of p rior PSYOP is immeasurable during initial TAA, the initial COA for U.S. or insurgent PSYOP efforts may be silence during the preparation phase or may be limited to face-to-face PSYOP during initial contact. M ILITARY D ECEPTION S CENARIOS 6-9. In preparing for UW operations, the potential to conduct military deception (MILDEC) operations exists. For example, commanders may consider PSYOP support to MILDEC operations that obscure and misdirect government efforts to discer n the intent and strength of prepar ations and then to accurately assess later phases (such as initial contact and infiltration of irregular and U.S. fo rces). Commanders may use MILDEC operations in later phases as well. The same caveats and cautions that apply to use of MILDEC in other operations apply in UW as well. ARSOF personnel may have to di ssuade insurgent forces from improperly using PSYOP series intent on perpetrating deception. Of part icular concern is irregular forces inflating their capability, thereby damaging their credibility the ir credibility with supporters and with government forces. Another concern is any proposed deception of suppor ters or sympathizers. Educating insurgent PSYOP cadre on the pitfa lls of unrealistic and potentially damaging support to MILDEC should take place as the phases of UW evolve. In addition, careful planning of U.S. PSYOP support to MILDEC operations is necessary. PHASE II: INITIAL CONTACT 6-10. During the initial contact phase of an operation, PSYOP support co ntinues by executing PSYOP series (products and PSYACTs) that support the preparation of the envi ronment. This phase includes preparing the civilian population to receive allied forces and actively assist in the UW mission to follow. PSYOP forces should identify requirements for information that the pilo t team can gather during its assessments. This information can range from media availability and transmission technical data to validating psychological assessments of key individuals and communicators to id entifying personnel and equipment requirements for establishing irregular PSYO P forces. The burden is on PSYOP forces to stay"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 6-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 abreast of all activities during each phase of the operation and meet suspenses for turning in information requirements. E XPATRIATES 6-11. During the initial contact phase and possibly extending back into t he preparation phase, expatriates from the nations in the UWOA may be a valuable asset. ARSOF must assess expatriates on an individual basis because both their motivations and willingness to accept risk may vary greatly. Expatriates who support a resistance can vary from mildly supportive and only ideologica lly sympathetic to willing to support initial contact and even take part in armed re sistance. Some expatriates may be former members of TAs. These expatriates can help with both TAA and product pretesting. Some key communicators can come from the expatriate community. Symbolic or ac tive leaders of UW operations may emerge from the expatriate community. I NDIGENOUS P OPULATION 6-12. Rank-and-file members of the population at remote locations, such as vill ages away from major population centers, typically make initial contact in UW. When eval uating these individuals for potential training as dedicated PSYOP cadre, or even for ba sic awareness of the psychological impact of UW operations, ARSOF may encounter a wide range of education and comprehensio n levels. In addition, during initial contact, necessity may dictate expending PSYOP resources on TAs that eventually will not be the focus of effort. Initial contact in terms of PSYOP may be with TAs that in the early stages of resistance may be critical to UW operations, such as rural villagers. As a UW operation matures, the focus of resources may shift to other TAs. K EY C OMMUNICATORS 6-13. Reaching and recruiting key communicators may be th e focus of initial contact efforts. Like many UW efforts, the initial key communicators may be much more locali zed in the early stages of a UW operation. The village elder who is a key communicator in initia l contact may eventually become simply a member of a wider TA, such as village elders in a given province or other subnational area. Conversely, major political dissidents or other key communicators typicall y have relevancy over the entire course of a UW operation. PHASE III: INFILTRATION 6-14. PSYOP forces may infiltrate with SF units complete or in part or may fol low on at a later time. Many factors contribute to this, including the tactical situation; con nectivity to development, production and dissemination assets; and location of the irregular for ce. PSYOP series may transition to another phase or program at this time depending on the plan that was developed during Phas e I. When this occurs, PSYOP series products designed to elicit support and assistance for the UW orga nization and U.S. forces must be carefully monitored. Evaluation criteria not only provide f eedback for the evaluation of a series of products and/or PSYOP program but may provide indicators that aid in FP measures and O PSEC as well. R ANK - AND -F ILE P SYCHOLOGICAL O PERATIONS A WARENESS 6-15. Developing awareness of the psychological impact of their activities begins when ARSOF infiltrate to begin assisting irregular forces. ARSOF should make the rank-a nd-file armed members, undergrounds, and auxiliaries aware of PSYOP program objectives and any themes t hey should stress or avoid. In addition, ARSOF personnel need to begin communi cating ideas and actual planned face-to-face PSYOP products that conform to the U.S. PSYOP progra m. If the infiltration plan includes transporting preapproved PSYOP products for dissemination by irregula r forces in an overt manner that will bring them in contact with the intended TA, they should have a sufficient understand ing of the product to (at a minimum) not detract from or contradict the product. Ideally, such disseminat ion plans should include supporting face-to-face PSYOP products as part of the series. Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) partners should also be sufficien tly cognizant of the PSYOP program to do no harm to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Psychological Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 6-5 the overall effort. Adequate intelligence sharing must take place so that ARSOF Soldiers are aware of any PSYOP executed by JIIM partners. D EDICATED C ADRE 6-16. During the infiltration phase, the segregation of dedicated PSYOP cadre in any arm of the irregular movement may be impractical or represent an unacceptable drain on limited personnel in the ea rly phases of UW. In addition, resources in terms of media as well as a lack of comprehe nsive knowledge of PSYOP may prohibit irregulars’ production of PSYOP series . However, during infiltration ARSOF can identify personnel within the resistance who can become the nucleus of a dedicated P SYOP force. As they develop, the underground and auxiliaries may be the first source of a pra ctical, dedicated PSYOP arm. PHASE IV: ORGANIZATION 6-17. During organization, the focus of the ARSOF un its is developing the capability of the required irregular force. PSYOP forces may need to develop an organic PSYOP capability within the force. PSYOP forces should carefully consider the organization, ro le, and techniques the irregular force will use. The insurgent force can use PSYOP forces as a neutral s ounding board. In this capacity, PSYOP Soldiers can form relationships with irregulars through informal contact du ring and after training. From these conversations, PSYOP Soldiers can help SF personnel gauge the moral e of the insurgents and help ensure that the training provided the irre gulars is accomplished using the mo st culturally relevant techniques available (Figure 6-1). For example, some irregulars may initially feel hom esick or miss family members and support groups from their local village while in training. This si tuation was a common occurrence while training Afghan personnel. Sin ce Afghan culture and society are trib ally based, members of different tribes who trained together often felt more of a sense of belonging to their own tribe or village instead of to the group they were training with. If ARSOF leave this situation unchecked, high potential exists for desertion. PSYOP Soldiers help identify factors that might cause desertion fr om training and create communication techniques and messages that reinforce the greater good of sacrif icing for the irregular effort. Themes of patriotism and nationalism are of particular use when pr operly employed in this situation. Figure 6-1.

The video portrayed the soldier writing in the letter to hi s father that, despite his discomfort with his surroundings and traini ng, he remained committed to the security and safety of his family and tribe that the new army would afford them in the coming months. He ended the letter stating that for the sake of t he honor of his family and their long-term safety he remained commi tted to the new army and his training. 6-18. It is natural to want to design the force similar to a U.S. organization. However, this may not be the most appropriate organization to accomplish the immediate task s facing the irregular force. Likewise, techniques taught must follow the legal guidelines that PSYOP forces follow to avoid potential legal fallout for the USG when training an irregular force. In addition, PSYOP forces ca n educate irregular force personnel on psychological aspects of the enemy force if they are not familiar w ith them. During Phase IV, PSYOP forces should support the development of the UW organization by capital izing on U.S. rapport-building activities and multiplying their effect s. PSYOP forces should take advantage of the situation during the organization phase to capture im ages (whether still or video) and interview the UW force to capture information for use in future products. G RASSROOTS P SYCHOLOGICAL O PERATIONS 6-19. Whether members of the irregular force are dedicated specifically to a PSYOP mission or are doing so as an additional duty, lack of equipment or suppor t in this stage may limit them to basic PSYOP media. They may conduct what might best be termed grassroots PSYOP that ut ilize whatever media they can use independently (Figure 6-2, pa ge 6-7). The inability to receive either i ndirect or direct su pport from U.S. or other allied forces may necessitate grassroots PSYOP. If executed using sound methodology and sufficient research, multiple low-cost, high-reward avenues exis t to reach select TAs. Wh en tactically feasible, face-to-face PSYOP and other in-person products, such as guerrilla theater, ca n resonate with TAs. Members of the underground or auxiliaries can pursue limited-risk cove rt media. This media can range from graffiti to simple alternative newsletters an d handbills. Recent experience has shown that some electronic media have passed into the realm of gras sroots PSYOP. Various elect ronic formats, such as digital video discs (DVDs), can provide a degree of security for irregular per sonnel located in adversary-controlled areas. These formats have had significant impact. U.S. personnel supporting and advising such activities must keep an open mind on what mig ht be an unusual form of media. However, U.S. personnel must also analyze proposed products that may be counterpr oductive, offensive, or may violate any of the basic tenets and historical truths of successful PSYO P. D EDICATED F ORCES 6-20. In the organization phase, it may prove useful and practical to encourage th e formation of dedicated PSYOP cadre and to train them for later stages. The goal is to build a skeletal structure that forces can flesh out during buildup as recr uitment grows. However, it can unacceptably drain limited combat power by overbuilding an indigenous PSYOP force. In addition, such a force in the underground or auxiliaries could expose it to a level of adversary scrutin y that is unacceptable. Therefore, in Phase IV (just as in Phase III) it may be necessary to limit the number of specifically tasked PSYOP personnel and continue to build databases of potential personnel with skill sets that might warrant a transfer of function at a later date."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Psychological Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 6-7 Figure 6-2. Afghan village elder addressing population on Psychological Operations loudspeaker R ELATIONSHIP W ITH O THER O RGANIZATIONS 6-21. It is likely that relationships between ad hoc or dedicated PSYOP cadre will become an important consideration at this time. Organizations paralleling U.S. milit ary and OGA structures will increasingly form in Phase IV, even if it is in embryonic form. Organizations among the guerrillas paralleling U.S. organizations that typically would work or deconflict with DOD PSYOP personnel should begin to work with dedicated military PSYOP cadre. At this stage, military PSYOP cadre and government-in-exile or shadow-government civilian PSYOP cadre may be the same organization. It is foreseeable that this task organization may continue even th rough the success of the insurgency. PSYOP cadr e should attempt to establish bonds, boundaries, and communications with thei r relevant counterparts within the armed wing of the insurgency, as well as any relevant civilian government-in-e xile organizations. T RANSREGIONAL AND G LOBAL R EACH 6-22. With the advent of multiple avenues of instant or near-real-time t ransfers of information and data, UW operator can assume that the UW operation has pr imarily a local or U.S. domestic audience. U.S. PSYOP forces are always aware of the potential for any action to quickly have an impact across the region in which the UW operation is being conducted and, quite often, across the globe . Irregular forces may or may not appreciate this fact and may require training and advising from A RSOF personnel. Conversely, they may from early stages plan for and use asymmetric capacity to reach wider a udiences. Although such"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 6-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 efforts may only begin in later phases, only a small group of trained individu als is necessary for an irregular force to utilize the Internet and global media outlets to promote PSYO P programs. When the underground or auxiliary must emphasize concealing their involv ement, the global media can sometimes provide additional anonymity b ecause of the difficulty of tracing through multiple servers and routers. Overt supporters of either a U.S.-sponsored irregular organization or its opp onents can use the reach of global media quite openly and overtly. ARSOF Soldiers must be aware of all such e fforts by the U.S.-sponsored irregular, allied, competitor, or antagonistic groups. In most instances, control of these types of asymmetric approaches used by an adversary may be impossible. The focus then must switch to counterpropaganda efforts. PHASE V: BUILDUP 6-23. During Phases IV and V, PSYOP forces may focu s on recruiting and building external support for the force. Depending on the duration of Phase V, ARSOF may focus on, increa se the number of, or maintain the previous level of capitulation programs during this phase. PSYO P forces may or may not begin more emphasis on preparing the populace for introd uction of the UW force. In general, ARSOF must ensure that no party compromises the covert nature of the operation. All operators at every level must safeguard the force. Although it is generally easy for forces support ing or conducting tactical-level support to keep this foremost in their minds, forces conducting strategic- or ope rational-level PSYOP may forget or be unaware of the potential co mpromising effects of products on the force—whether they come unintentionally while disseminating talking points or unconsciously i n a newspaper article. R ECRUITMENT 6-24. Typically during buildup, some active PSYOP programs to produce series on recr uitment can be pursued. Although recruitment of members of the un derground or auxiliary remains either covert or clandestine, motivating TAs susceptible to joining these organiza tions can be pursued by highlighting the successes of the organization. In addition, recruitment series for the armed force may have an effect on recruitment in other areas as well. No PSYOP support to recruitmen t should make unrealistic or unfulfillable promises. ARSOF Soldiers must caution irregular fighters and organizations from making these promises as well. Although po tential recruits may be accustomed to strong-arm tactics or coercion from the government, ARSOF Soldiers should discourage this avenue in face-to-face encounters and avoid it as a PSYOP approach. D OMESTIC S UPPORT 6-25. Although not necessarily the primary effort in PSYOP programs, some PSY OP series typically target supporters of the irregular effort. The behavior desired in such groups is oft en to increase efforts, donations, and recruitment. In the buildup phase, this may entail attempting to move s upporters from nominal agreement to active participation. During buildup, some supporters have unrealistically short time spans for success. Common themes during UW are often persever ance and the tactical necessity of a “long war.” Themes may need to discourage abortive, disorganized efforts as well. In many UW efforts, uniting several dissimilar organizations into a single front is useful. During buildup, A RSOF advisors may frequently need to advise against COAs that might alienate supporters. 6-26. In any insurgency, even those initiated with support from a larg e portion of the population, sizeable portions of the population will be uncommitted to eith er the adversary or the fo rces backed in the UW effort. In a UW operation where the government maintains large blocks of tac it support through coercion, violence, or bribery, that support may disappear when the government loses power. In addition to supporting desired behaviors in committed supporters, U.S.-directed PSYOP supp ort and irregular force PSYOP programs will typically target the uncommitted in UW efforts. An irony of UW is that every person remaining uncommitted rather than supporting the advers ary is a partial success. Typically, this behavior is not actively encouraged. However, ARSOF should not ignore the realit y that antiadversary PSYOP may produce this effect. In the long-t erm PSYOP plan, this may be a nece ssary stage before garnering active support for the UW effort. However, the focus of programs should usually be on moving fence-sitters into passive or active support of the irregular organization’s efforts."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Psychological Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 6-9 6-27. Supporters of an adversary government can vary greatly in their degree of c ommitment. Early TAA will reveal the likelihood that government supporters will be sus ceptible to abandoning the government, moving against it, or metaphorically or literally “d ying in place” for it. Hard-c ore government supporters may be unreachable no matter how impossible their tactical situation becomes. History has shown, however, that authoritarian regimes (the typical target in UW) do no t enjoy deep ideological commitment beyond the upper levels of the regime and those completely dependent upon it. E ven powerful backers, such as major corporations, may well be swayed if they perceive no th reat from the irregular organization. During buildup, susceptible TAs within the ranks of government s upporters may be a lucrative target. In addition, inevitability and capitulation themes and sy mbols may be useful during buildup. However, if buildup is progressing well and OPSEC allows release of some figures, governm ent supporters may not believe the actual level of support for the UW effort and such series ma y be counterproductive. E XTERNAL S UPPORT 6-28. Although not as critical to success in UW as is in ternal support, external support for an irregular effort is for the most part beneficial. An exception is always external support that may be viewed in a negative way by domestic TAs. For instance, the assistance of region al nations or organizations can be seen as interventionist or self-serving. ARSOF may need to downplay U.S. support fo r this reason as well. Typically, the opposite is true—external support for the insurgency legitim izes it and increases the psychological effects of the irregul ar’s cause. U.S. PSYOP support may attempt to build greater external support for an irregular effort or leave this function to irregular PSYOP organiza tions. Surrogate PSYOP forces and the irregular force should be cautione d not to inflate claims of external support. I NCREASING M EDIA O PERATIONS 6-29. During buildup, the security situation in limited areas may shift sufficiently to allow for committal of more U.S. PSYOP assets, as well as the operation of new types of media by the underground or the auxiliary. The projection of new media types from external sites may bec ome practical as the irregular organization grows. In addition, more sophisticated ty pes of media may have been deliberately held back until sufficient levels were reached during buildup. This situation can be particular ly true if TAs would not find U.S.-produced media credible. PHASE VI: EMPLOYMENT 6-30. Combat operations may not directly involve U.S. forces, but this does not preclude PS YOP forces from supporting the UW force. During the employment phase, widely varying mixtures of unilateral U.S. combined and unilateral irregular force PSYOP are possi ble. In all cases, however, PSYOP forces’ primary role is not that of a shooter in direct action roles. PSY OP forces should be careful not to misuse their skills. PSYOP forces support SFODAs by communicating messages designed to el icit desired behaviors from local people that support the activities of the SF units and the irregu lar organization. PSYOP programs can capitalize on the actions of the UW force to support ca pitulation of individuals, groups, and units. PSYOP forces continue their role as a force multiplier by e liciting support for the operation in and around combat operation areas. Sympathizers may be much more sus ceptible to recruitment PSYOP arguments once action has started. In addition, rewards for information programs can provide informati on that may prove invaluable to the operation. 6-31. Another means of bolstering the fighting spirit and mo rale of insurgent forces is to mitigate or minimize any tactical setback s. Doing so may entail mitigating the mistakes of individual irregu lar force or shadow government leaders and stress ing the competence of leadership in general. Highlighting tactica l or operational successes also mitigates any failures by the irregular fo rce. Regardless of the type of support they are providing, however, PSYOP forces must not get caught up in the excitement of long-awaited action. PSYOP forces should— Continue to update TAA. Capture and analyze feedback from ongoing an d previously executed programs and series. Analyze government and other adversary propaganda. Update plans for supporting the next phase of the operation."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 6-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 PSYOP Support to the UW Force in Afghanistan During combat operations in Afghanistan, ARSOF provided support to the Northern Alliance. The Northern Alliance was having offensive success and had driven the enemy forces to the town of Kunduz. Anticoalition militias movi ng into the town forced the people of Kunduz to support them. This fact was known t o the commanding officer of the Northern Alliance, and he requested that PSYOP forces assist in reducing collateral damage and unwanted civilian casualties during the capture of the town. The objective was to reduce the number of civilian casu alties and win the support of the town’s people for the Nort hern Alliance. PSYOP forc es broadcast radio messages from the EC-130, COMMANDO SOLO , and dropped leaflets that let the people know if they opened their gates to the Northern Alliance there would be no retribution taken against them, and the Nort hern Alliance would safeguard them. The people of Kunduz took this message as credible and opened the town’s gates to the Northern Alliance. The Northern Alliance t ook the town and gained the support of the local populace. 6-32. During the employment phase, PSYOP forces typically direct products towa rd eliciting behaviors that degrade the support for the adversary forces and their standing governm ent. Generally during the employment phase, some degree or even a high degree of vilific ation of the government and standing military forces is useful. PSYOP forces may need to cau tion the irregular force against using overly divisive series that may make their own consolidation of power a nd any national reconciliation more difficult. PSYOP series at this point typically share the UWOA with PA messages and DOS products communicating the USG position on the standing governm ent. PSYOP series may inform select TAs of USG positions as well, but this is secondary to elic iting specific behaviors, such as defections, to the irregular force. ARSOF personnel during this time may also have to caution i rregular forces from inflating claims of success or making unachievable promises. PHASE VII: TRANSITION 6-33. The transition phase marks the end of hostilities and the start of s tability operations. Depending on the situation, rewards for information programs may continue. Generally, howe ver, transition phase marks the introduction of legitimacy and professionalism progr ams. Regardless of whether or not U.S. military forces begin FID operations, PSYOP forces can work with OGAs and embassy teams to support DOS and national objectives. If PSYOP forces transition from supporting DOD operations t o DOS missions, they must ensure that programs do not lapse and that PSYOP execution remains seamless. L EGITIMIZATION 6-34. Legitimization of any new government, military, and other instit utions formed by or radically reorganized by a successful UW effo rt is often central to transition PSYOP. U.S. PSYOP forces may not accomplish this legitimization. Instea d, former irregular force PSYOP personnel may condu ct postconflict programs. Part of the legitimization of a new government may entail advising the new government and military against reprisals of any kind. PSYOP programs supporting amne sties, new freedoms, or enforcement of long-denied civil rights; domestic di sarmament programs; and humanitarian measures not only provide practical benefits but also legitimize or create a better climate in which the new government can be legitimized. A major focus of DOD PSYOP an d DOS public information efforts may center on new constitutions, national laws, or elections. ARSOF personnel may p romote the need for a national self-determining vote from the beginning to support a successful irregular move ment’s new government. At this stage, however, ARSOF personnel may need to discourage the same sort o f behaviors the outgoing military and government conducted, including voting irregularities. S HIFT OF F OCUS 6-35. During transition, previously untargeted TAs may become more important to the peacetime PSYOP program. For instance, UW efforts rarely result in the immediate halt of armed opposition. Typically, a"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Psychological Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 6-11 hard-core element of the former government and military begins an insurgency o f its own at this time. Although small in number, it may have secured large amounts of resources befo re abandoning previous bases and sites. As underdogs, these elements may be more susceptibl e to PSYOP. 6-36. Other TAs and new desired behaviors typically emer ge in transition operations, regardless of the level of resistance the new government faces. Even if the old adversary govern ment’s supporters do begin an insurgency, the new government established by the UW effort should foc us on promoting its agenda rather than reacting to an insurgency. Domestic PSYOP programs may instead focus on economic and governance issues and, thereby, minimize an insurgency. In addition, PSYOP in the transition phase may focus some resources on regional or international issues, such as reassuri ng bordering nations or traditional trade partners. In the early days of transition, this an d other issues not typically the purview of U.S. PSYOP may of necessity be done by members of the former irregular force until the new government can form a civilian international information program and a diplomatic corps. S TANDING D OWN F ORCES 6-37. After a successful UW operation, the new military may expand any existing military PSYOP force they had during earlier phases or release personnel from other duties to join or start such a force. Typically, a new government will also ask for more U.S. PSYOP su pport in transition rather than less. However, the sociopolitical realities in the country may make domes tic PSYOP impossible, especially if the former government had propaganda units associated with excesses or civil rights viola tions. Although needed, political realities may force the immediate redeployme nt of most or all ARSOF PSYOP personnel. In a society expecting a smaller military or less military participation in the life of the nation, one of the last endeavors for domestic or U.S. PSYOP personnel may be to focus attention and su pport from select TAs for a stand-down of forces. E XTENDED A RMY S PECIAL O PERATIONS F ORCES P SYCHOLOGICAL O PERATIONS P RESENCE 6-38. Regardless of whether large-scale FID operations become necessary, PS YOP personnel may have an extended presence in what can now be termed an HN. Whether the new government creates, expands, or stands down its own PSYOP force, the U.S. Ambassador may request the deployment of a military information support team. A larger U.S. PSYOP presence may also tackle other prob lem areas even if they do not train, advise, or support HN PSYOP personnel. In the wake of the changes brought about by UW, other threat elements may emerge that also affect U.S. national interests. These can include narcotics production and trafficking, maritime or intellectual piracy, and, because of new freedoms and openness in society, terrorism. Much as the UW effort is a long -term process, the consolid ation of the advantages gained by a new government may take years to achieve . It may take years to stabilize the new government and establish its viability against any armed resistance. This process may involve frequent rotations of PSYOP personnel or the long-term deployment of a military information support team.

During the past century, most internal resistance movements have failed. St anding governments crushed most internal resistance movements before they developed a critical mass of skill and support or were simply incapable of attaining such a critical mass. Successful movements possessed sufficient FP and CI capabilities to prevent the government, whether an indigenous regim e or outside partner, from pushing the conflict to decision in the military realm until the po wer balance shifted in favor of the irregular force. They did this either by making the political and psyc hological realms decisive (since it was much easier for them to attain parity with the government in this sphere) or by postpo ning decisive military encounters until they weakened the controlling force through guerrilla, political, CA, and psychological operations. 7-2. For the irregular efforts to succeed, they must attain the pivotal concept of legitimacy. This concept assumes the people of a country will decide whether the government or t he insurgents can offer them the “best alternative” in terms of goods and services and then will support t hat organization. Following this line of thought, the basis of ARSOF UW activity is the irre gular forces identifying the genuine grievances of its people and taking political, economic, and social actions to redress t hem. The integration of CA forces in the seven phases of UW enhances the ARSOF planner’s margin for success. NOTE: Some of the following phases may occur simultaneously or—in certain situations—not at all. PHASE I: PREPARATION 7-3. ARSOF and irregular force leaders must consider not only the military forces but also the operational environment in which those forces operate. To see first, understand first, act first, and finish decisively in the operational environment, irregular forces must consider civilian comp onent political, military, economic, social, informational, and in frastructure factors. In other words, they must consider civil areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events (ASCOPE) aspects and their impact on the mission of irregular forces. CA forces support the ARSOF command er in CMO by focusing on CA core tasks when conducting CAO. It is imperative that CA personnel are include d in all phases of the operation from planning to transition and are capable of performing CMO in support of UW (Figure 7-1, page 7-2). A REA S TUDY AND A REA A SSESSMENT 7-4. The U.S. military orients CA units toward a specific region of the world. This orientation helps CA units focus their personnel and training. Examples include language, cultura l norms, and operational requirements unique to the assigned region. The initia ting process of prime importance in preparation for operations is the area study. Area study files contain information on a designated area. General areas of information include history, public administration, cultural relations, and supply , among others. This information supports contingency and SO planning in areas assigned to o perational forces. CA personnel obtain, analyze, and record information in advance of a need. Although an area study has no set format, information acquired through the study supports the area assessment. 7-5. The CA area assessment begins with the receipt of a mission. The CA area assessment supports SO. This assessment should supplement, not repeat, the basic area study. Th e area study and assessment ensure all functional areas of the AOR are covered."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 7-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Figure 7-1.

The culmination of the area study an d area assessment effort is a syst em analysis of the operational area. This analysis equips ARSOF CA forces with unique information requireme nts (IRs). IRs contained in the analysis target specific areas, people, source mate rials, and agencies relevant to the operation and essential to mission preparation and execution. Such IRs might include but are not limited to— Typography, hydrography, climate, weather, and terrain, including landf orms, drainage, vegetation, and soils. Census, location, ethnic composition, and health factors of the popul ation. Attitude of the population, including ideological, religious, a nd cultural aspects.

Other initial contact activities ma y occur outside the UWOA through coordination with shadow government and auxiliary personnel, whethe r conducted during Phase II or a later phase. An initial assessment based on the area study begins when the first CA personnel arrive in the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Civil Affairs Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 7-3 UWOA. Information contained in this assessment clarifie s what support is available to both the irregular forces and the local population and what support needs to be provided. Duri ng this period the assessment team will identify or confirm the leaders, centers of gravity, and influential persons. The CA battalion (Figure 7-2), through one of its four CA companies, will then begin providing tactical CA support, to include assessment, planning, and coordination with the civil component and IG Os, NGOs, and IPI, in areas where military forces are present. Figure 7-2. Active Army Civil Affa irs battalion operational structure 7-8. Functions of the CA battalion support the core tasks of CMO (Figure 7 -3, page 7-4). These functions include the following: Promote U.S. policy objectives before, during, and after combat operations by influe ncing the civil component of the operational area. Reduce demands on the supply system by facilitating the coordination of i ndigenous resources and supplies, where appropriate. Fulfill responsibilities of the SOF under U.S. domestic and international laws relevant to civilian populations. These responsibilities may become evident when cons idering the safety and protection of local government personnel, religious leaders, and others con sidered centers of gravity that may be targeted for reprisal. Minimize civilian interference with irregular oper ations and the impact of these operations on the civilian populace. Control m easures may include curfews, movement restrictions, travel permits, registration cards, and relocation of the population. Coordinate ARSOF operations with other irregul ar forces, agencies, IPI, IGOs, and NGOs. Exercise civil administration in occupied or lib erated areas until civilian or non-U.S. military authority can retake control of this function.

Sustaining operations at any echelon can enable shaping and decisive operations by providing logistics support, rear-area and base security, movement control, ter rain management, and infrastructure development. CAO and CMO normally support sustaining operations throu gh their planning abilities in movement control and infrastructure development. CAO and CMO support sustainin g operations working with IPI and local authorities to protect local sources of essential supplies and services. CA forces support sustaining operations by— Providing liaison to local agencies and civilian authorities. Identifying the local resources, facilities, and support available for insurgency operations. Coordinating the use by irregular forces of lo cal resources, facilities, and support, such as civilian labor, transportation, communications, medical facili ties, and miscellaneous services and supplies. Facilitating irregular efforts to develop and implement plans for using l ocal resources, as well as supporting civil information programs and coordi nating these efforts with those of IGOs, NGOs, and IPI. Minimizing the impact of UW operations on civilians through IO and b y planning for possible population displacements. Managing civilian access to areas of ongoing operations using ARSOF advisors and local auxiliaries. Facilitating the passage of civilian humanitarian assistance and providers when possible. Advising the ARSOF command on cultural and moral considerations. PHASE V: BUILDUP 7-12. During buildup, CA forces will assist the ARSOF commander in an expandi ng operational area through shaping operations. Shaping operations at an y echelon create and preserve conditions for the success of the decisive operation. In UW operations, sh aping operations often conv ert temporary gains into long-term political success. Sh aping operations can aim to keep newl y gained stability from being undone. Shaping operations may focus on identifying and cooling potential flash points that can occur after initial stabilization efforts. The main ef fort during shaping operations is military-to-civilian contact. The secondary effort is civilian-to-civilian contact by O GAs. CA forces conduct CAO, and CMO planners plan CMO to deter a potential crisis, reinforce or regain public support of the transitional government and U.S. forces, and mitigate conditions that lead toward irre gular safe havens. CMO are shaping operations that gain favor with the IPI and influence positive attitudes and percepti ons. CMO directly support the ARSOF commander’s ability to conduct shaping operations in his UWOA by facilitating the transfer of responsibilities to IPI. PHASE VI: EMPLOYMENT 7-13. Normally, CAO and CMO support offensive or defensive operations by enabli ng maneuver, mainly through planning populace and resources control (PRC) and providing cr itical civil information to increase the ARSOF commander’s situational awareness and understanding. All CA core tasks support CMO. CMO support UW operations and normally prevent or mitig ate the effects of natural or man-made disasters. Normally, CAO and CMO support UW operations through stability operations by assisting in the establish- ment of order in the UWOA.

S TABILITY O PERATIONS 7-14. Forces conduct CAO and CMO during offensive and defensive operations to set the conditions for stability operations. CMO are the major effort of stability operations. CA suppo rt to stability operations depends on the condition of the affected IPI. The CMO staff continually mo nitors the condition of the transitional governing body during the operation, applies available res ources to affect the civilian component, and recommends functional skills require d to support this critical phase. CAO support conventional forces, SOF, USG agencies , and the local civil administration in transitioning the power to t he new administration. 7-15. Conflict termination marks the start of new challe nges for CA forces and CMO planners. These may include encounters with the local populace as it responds to a new or significantly changed government and to a new way of life. Problems may involve the unrealized hopes and aspiratio ns of the local populace, as well as local leaders’ desire for recognition as the legitimate power. T he need to maintain and restore law and order, as well as basic life services (food, water, electricity), is critical early in stability operations. During stability operations, the main effort shifts from military-to-mil itary to military-to-civilian contacts. 7-16. Insurgency forces, if any, also present unique challenges for the commander. Th e ultimate goal is the complete demobilization of the irregular force and the return of those force s to civilian pursuits. Demobilization involves, among other things, the collection of weapons. The de mobilization effort may be difficult unless the irregular force r eceives assurances of security, tran sition assistance, jobs, and proper resettlement. 7-17. The goals of stability operations may not be achie vable in the short term. Success often requires perseverance and a long-term commitment to resolving th e source of the conflict. The achievement of these goals may take years. Conversely, daily operations may require rapid responses t o changing conditions based on unanticipated localized conflict among competing groups. Civil consid erations are especially critical in stability operations. The civil population, new governm ent, NGOs, and IGOs can greatly affect achieving stability. 7-18. Stability operations are usually nonlinear and nonc ontiguous. ARSOF and indi genous leaders tailor the application of the operational framework, elements of operationa l design, and METT-TC to fit each situation. During stability operations, identifying centers of gravity, decisive points—and even the desired end state—can be more complex and unorthodox than in offensive and defensive ope rations. In stability operations, the adversary is often disease, hunger, or the consequences of disas ter. CMO and CA planners are integral players in the successful execution of stability operation missions. Forces may conduct stability operations in any operational environment."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Civil Affairs Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 7-7 7-19. The CA supporting tasks in CMO are of support to the ARSOF commander’s oper ational function in UW. Generally, CA Soldier tasks include— Assessing and assisting in the restora tion of essential government services. Assisting in the protection of public health and safety (within the limits of Federal law and the United States Code [USC]). Assisting in the provision of emergency relief to the new government, bus inesses, and individuals. Identifying and assessing the threat posed by hazardous materials (civil considerations). Providing consultation through the defense coordinating officer to decisi on makers. Participating in interagency assessment, planning, and synchronizi ng of domestic stability operations. Participating in the execution of selected CMO activities, as ne eded or directed. 7-20. It is during this stability phase that CA personnel provide the greatest s upport to the indigenous populace and new or transitional government, which re quires the employment of CA functional specialists from the USAR. The following paragraphs discuss CA personnel specialty area s. Rule of Law 7-21. The purpose of rule-of-law operations is to creat e security and stability for the civilian population. Rule-of-law operations provide legitimacy to the new or transitional government by restoring and enhancing the effective and fair administration a nd enforcement of justice through impartial legal institutions and competent safety systems. Rule-of-law operations a re of great importance in stability operations. Rule-of-law operations are particularly significant in the immedia te aftermath of major ground combat operations when it is imperative to restore order to the civ ilian population in the vacuum that inevitably results when combat disrupts the routine administration of the society. Close coordination between the rule-of-law section and the governance section to achieve sy nchronization and synergy between efforts to restore, reform, and assist the cour t and legal system and the public safety system is critical. A judicial system is powerl ess without an effective public safety system, whereas a public safety system is not legitimate without a fair and efficient judicial system. Infrastructure 7-22. The infrastructure section consists of functional sp ecialists in public works, transportation, utilities, and communications. It provides technical expertise, staff advice, and planning assista nce to the supported command. The section assesses the indigenous public in frastructure and systems. Using its assessments and civilian skills, the team determines methods to design, build, and maintain the organizations, architecture, and systems required to support transportation, water, communications, and pow er. The infrastructure section provides recommendations and, when appropriate, direction to ma intain, sustain, and improve indigenous public systems and services, such as transportation, util ities, and postal systems. Governance 7-23. The governance section consists of functional specialists in public administration and services (excluding public health and welfare), cultural relations, and education. It provides technical expertise, staff advice, and planning assistance to the supported command in creating, resourc ing, managing, and sustaining the institutions and processes that govern a nd protect a society. Personnel in this section include public administrators, public safety administrato rs and managers, environmental administrators and managers, and other administrators whose civilian duties include upper-level management of public institutions at various levels (city, county, local, state, and fede ral). Public Health and Welfare 7-24. The public health and welfare section consists of functional specialists in public health and medical services. It provides technical expe rtise, staff advice, and planning a ssistance to the supported command in creating, resourcing, managing, and sustaining the institutions and processes through which a society"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 7-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 maintains the physical, mental, and social health of its people. Some skills required in this section include doctors, dentists, hospital administrators, nurses, public health spe cialists, environmental scientists and specialists, museum curators, archivists, and others whose civilian duties include health and welfare management in addition to arts, monuments, and archives. Economic Stability 7-25. The economic stability section consists of functio nal specialists in economic fields and business administration. It provides technical expertise, staff advice, and planning assis tance to the supported command. The section assesses government, corporate, and private resources and syst ems. Using these assessments, based on their civilian skills, the team determines how to assist in the efficient management of resources, goods, and services to enhance the viability of the societ y’s economic system. The economic stability section provides recommendations and, when appropriate , directions to maintain, sustain, and improve economic systems and services. Some skills found in this sect ion include economists, bankers, supply technicians, business administ rators, entrepreneurs, agriculturalists, farmers, food specialists and technicians, marketing and distribution specialists, a nd other officer and enlisted personnel whose civilian skills make them suitable for improving a nation’s economic syste m. Public Education and Information 7-26. The public education and informat ion section consists of functiona l specialists in education and information services. It provides technical expertise, staff advice, and planni ng assistance to the supported command in designing, resourcing, and implementing public education and informat ion programs and systems through media and formal education institutions. Some skills requi red in this section include educators at all levels, education specialists, school administ rators, public relations personnel, media specialists, and others whose civilian duties include educatio n and information management. L OCAL D EFENSE T RAINING 7-27. Internal defense training is an umbrella concept that covers a broad range of activities. Its primary intent is to help address internal threats and their underlying causes. Commensurat e with U.S. policy goals, the focus of all U.S. efforts is to support internal defense and development. Civil defense training is not restricted to times of conflict. It can also take place in the form of training exercises and other activities that show irregular-force resolve to and for the region. 7-28. Of primary importance to the irregular forces is the security and welfare of the population that supports the movement. Without this support, the insurgency is doomed to fail. CA forces support local security through local defense tr aining. Local defense training protects the society from subversion, lawlessness, hostile government retaliation, and the effects of man-made and natural disasters. 7-29. The proper use of ARSOF CA assets in UW is essen tial during all phases of an insurgency to counter retaliation by the hostile government. When used to its full potential, CMO can be crucial to solidify the position of the transitional government and improve secu rity conditions for the people. CAO vary with the capabilities of the new administration and with the le vel of hostile activity. The economic, social, and political situations are also major influences. CA elements suppo rting local security— Review U.S. security assistance program goal s to support the insurgent security plan. Plan CMO based on the seven phases of insurgency. Train irregular forces to plan, train for, and conduct nation assistance, PRS, an d other CAO appropriate to the needs of its region. Train on TTP required to prot ect the populace from lawlessness and retaliation and develop indigenous individual, leader, and organizationa l skills to isolate hostile personnel and protect the civil population. Establish and maintain contact with nonmilitary agencies and l ocal authorities. Identify specific CMO missions the new leadership can and should c onduct."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Civil Affairs Operations 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 7-9 PHASE VII: TRANSITION 7-30. CMO planners, usually CA-trained personnel, play a major role in transition planning. Based on their expertise, these personnel may be the best group to perform this functi on. For these planners to accomplish this task, a clearly identifiable end state and transition or terminat ion criteria for the operation must be developed (JP 3-57 includes further information). Termin ation or transition occurs when either the mission has been accomplished or when the President or SecDef so directs. Planners may base criteria for termination or transition on events, measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and success, availability of resources, or a specific date. A successful harvest or rest orations of critical facilitie s in the crisis area are examples of events that might trigger termination of the miss ion. An acceptable drop in mortality rates, a certain percentage of dislocated civilians returned to their homes, or a given decrease in threat activity against the operation are examples of MOEs that may prompt the end of ARSOF involvement. 7-31. The transition plan is vital if stability operations ar e to be a success. It prio ritizes and plans for the successful handover of missions to a follo w-on agency or force. It is either military or civil in nature or a blending of the two. Examples of these organizations are peacekeeping entities under a UN mandate, IGOs, NGOs, or IPI. CA forces and CMO planners are uniquely qualified to advise the commander on activities that reduce turmoil and stabilize the situation until internat ional relief organizations or IPI assume control. 7-32. Transition may occur between U.S. military fo rces, another military force (for example, multinational or forces from the affected country), regional organization s, the UN, or indigenous civilian organizations. A detailed plan addressing the various civil functi ons and to whom they will transition greatly reduces the turmoil typically associated with transition. The CMO staff should periodically review the transition plan with all participating organizations. This rev iew will ensure that planning assumptions are still valid and determine if changes in the situation require change s in the transition plan. 7-33. For CAO planners to accomplish this task, a cl early identifiable end state and transition or termination criteria for the operation must be developed (Figure 7-4). Transit ion planning must start during the initial phases of operation planning to ensure that planners pay adequate attention to this critical area. ARSOF plan for transition when they plan for intervention. Has the end state been achieved? Can forces be safely withdrawn from the operational area? Has consideration been given as to when USAR forces will be released? Has coordination for redeployment of the force been conducted with appropriate commands, agencies, and other organizations? Has the commander identified postconflict requirements? Has transition planning been accomplished in t he event that operations are transitioning to another military force, regional organization, UN, or civili an organization? Have stated operational objectives been accomplished? Have the underlying causes of the confli ct been considered, and how do they influence termination planning? What additional support will be required for redeployment? What are the FP requirements? What arrangements have been made with ot her organizations to accomplish the postconflict activities? For example, w ill there be humanitarian, governmental, and infrastructure assistance requirements? What is the policy for evacuati on of equipment used by the force? What is the policy for redeployment? How will postconflict requirements impact t he timeline for redeployment of the force? Will the force be expected to sup port these types of activities?

Historically, the international community has undertaken stabi lization and reconstruction operations in an ad hoc fashion, recreating the to ols and relationships each time a crisis arises. If the United States is to ensure that countries are set on a sustainable path toward peace, de mocracy, and a market economy, it needs new, institutionalized foreign-policy tools—tools that can in fluence the choices countries and people make about the nature of their economies, their political systems, the ir security, and in some cases, the very social fabric of a nation. In July 2004, Congress cr eated the State Department’s Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS). The mission of the S/CRS is to integrate military expertise and best practices into the civilian world, while preserving the fle xibility and agility necessary to respond to the highly fluid environments of conflict transformati on. There is a tremendous as ymmetry in the resources that the military and civilian worlds bring to bear on planning. S/CRS con siders it a priority to develop a cadre of civilian planners for reconstruction, stab ilization, and conflict transformation. C/SRS core objectives include— Monitor and plan. Develop clear policy options concerning states and regions of greatest risk and importance and lead U.S. planning focused on these priorities to avert crises, when possible, and to prepare for th em when necessary. Mobilize and deploy. Coordinate the deployment of U.S. resources and implementation of programs in cooperation with international and local partners to accelerate transitions from conflict to peace. Prepare skills and resources. Establish and manage an interagency capability to deploy personnel and resources in an immediate surge re sponse and the capacity to sustain assistance until traditional support mechanisms can operate effectively. Learn from experience. Incorporate best practices and lessons learned into functional changes in training, planning, exercises, and operationa l capabilities that support improved performance. Coordinate with international partners. Work with international and multilateral organizations, individual states, and NGOs to plan and acceler ate deployment and increase interoperability of personnel and equipment in multilateral operations. 7-35. When ARSOF conduct UW, CA forces must coordinate CAO with this relativ ely new USG C/SRS asset from the earliest practical moment in the preparation p hase through the UW operation to transition or the final ARSOF efforts in the UWOA. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 8-1 Chapter 8 Supporting Elements and Activities INTRODUCTION 8-1. ARSOF communications, logistics, medical, and aviation elements conduct activities to support SO, including support to UW. Most SO are politically sensitive, high-risk a nd high-reward strategic operations, and these characteristics of support to ARSOF SO will re main constant regardless of the specific operation. Nevertheless, ARSOF supporting units must consider the often -protracted nature of UW (typically within a hostile and denied territory), the fundamental UW quality of supporting (directly or indirectly) an irregular TA, and the degree of relative self-sufficiency with in which ARSOF and supported irregular organizations must operate. UW is fundamentally an effort to persua de and assist others to act in concert with U.S. national strategic objectives. The focus is primarily on the behavior of relevant TAs, and the application of firepower and the conduct of combat operations is us ually a secondary concern. Moreover, tactical SO characterized by time-sensitive, direct, and speci fically limited application of SO capabilities—while important—will often be subordinate supporting efforts to a protracted, ess entially indirect, and mutable UW campaign. COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT 8-2. To enable its assigned forces to perform the ARSOF core tasks, USSOCOM de veloped doctrinal communications principles and architectural tenets. These principles and tenets guide ARSOF communications support of SO, including support of UW. Communications systems support to ARSOF must be— Global . SOF communications systems span the full range of diverse SO missions worldwi de. SOF communications make maximum use of existing national capa bilities and commercial, tactical, and HN assets. Access to the infosphere is available at the lowest possible tactical level. In UW, some use of and interoperability with HN or irregular organizations’ indigenous assets should be expected. Secure . Employment of SOF communications systems involves the use of the latest techn ology procedures and National Security Agency (NSA)-approved encrypti on and devices that prevent exploitation by the enemy. Use of HN or irregular assets makes adherin g to this principle more challenging. Mission-tailored . SOF communications systems deploy re lative to the projected operational environment, information transfer requ irements, threat, and mission analysis. Value-added . SOF communications systems never compromise a unit on the ground, in the ai r, or at sea. Flexibility and interoperability of communications syst ems substantially increase the fighting effectiveness of the SOF warrior. Jointly interoperable . SOF communications systems are interoperable by design, adapting to varying C2 structures. They support operations w ith joint, multinational, and interagency forces. In UW, this principle implies combined inte roperability with fore ign irregular forces. A RCHITECTURAL T ENETS 8-3. ARSOF must be able to communicate worldwide and at any time by using national, theater, and SOF communications assets. Doctrinal principles and planning considerations are th e building blocks for an operational architecture that guides communications systems strategy. The architectural tenets for SOF communications systems provide SOF elements seamless, robust, protected, and automated communications systems, using the full-frequency spectrum while making sure t he systems comply with established standards."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 8-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 8-4. Implementation of these tenets eliminates tr aditional geographical, procedural, and technical boundaries. The infosphere allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. SOF architectural tenets are: Seamless . Digital SOF communications systems are transparent to the wa rrior and support every phase of the mission profile—in garrison, in tran sit, and while deployed. Multiple entry points into the infosphere, high-speed networks, and worldwide Global Informat ion Grid (GIG) connectivity are critical elements of this tenet. Robust . Robust networks feature multiple routing, alternative sources of connectivity, bandwidth on demand, modularity, and scalability. Multiple r outing and alternative sources of connectivity prevent single points of failure and site isolation. Bandwidth on demand, provid ing automatic network reconfiguration, is available for garriso n locations via secure commercial means and via the SCAMPI entry points for tactical SOF. Protected . SOF C2 nodes are lucrative targets for all types of adversaries ranging from fore ign governments to hackers. A thorough information assurance (IA) plan protects SOF communications architectures and critical resour ces from attack and intrusion. Creating and maintaining sound communications security, co mputer security, and information security programs are necessary to protect the network. Automated . SOF communications systems must facilitate the exchange of di gital data and implement advanced automation techniques to reduce operator manning and to exploit unattended operation. Full automation facilitates the exchange of information with all Soldiers in the mission, including elements of a multinational joint force, other SOF components , a wide range of intelligence sources, and national information sources. Ne tworking technology of the local area network and the wide area network is the cornerstone of a digital, seamless nodal architecture that provides transpar ent connectivity at all echelons. Full spectrum . SOF communications systems must not be limited in the use o f the entire frequency spectrum for information transfer. SOF have been at the forefront of exploi ting new technology to take advantage of more of the frequency spectrum. In addition , blending in available HN assets can enhance many SO missions. ARSOF must be in a position to use not only emerging technology but also technology outside traditional high-frequency (HF) and man-portable satellite systems. Standards compliant . SOF communications systems must adhere to commercial, interna tional, federal, and DOD hardware and software standards. Adherence to DOD communications standards ensures a capability to interchange hard ware and software products. Adherence also permits the interface and exchange of data, through the infospher e and GIG, with all organizations that support or require SOF. 8-5. These tenets should be realized between ARSOF units deployed in the UWOA and U.S. stations external to it. However, combined communications between ARSOF units and the irregular organizations they support in the UWOA will make these tenets more difficult to achieve. ARSOF must consider and plan for the limitations of irregular communications capabili ties. 8-6. The mission of the ARSOF 112th Signal Battalion (A ) is to provide strategic, operational, and tactical communications for joint and Army SO comma nders in support of deliberate plans (including UW), crisis action operations, and the WOT. It is the onl y Army signal unit specifically dedicated to support deployed SO. The 112th Signal Battalion (A) can provide signal force packages as directed or as available. Additional tasks include providing communications for standing JTFs in USASOC and USSOCOM as well as being the home station operations center to manage all USASOC sat ellite systems. The 112th Signal Battalion (A) provides required coordination between the five Theater Netw ork Operations and Security Centers, Defense Information Systems Agency, De fense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and USSOCOM. 8-7. The 112th Signal Battalion (A) is a unique organization in its structure and i ts mission to support SO, including ARSOF conduct of UW. Because of its mission, the 112th Signal Battalion (A) is uniquely equipped to provide enhanced communications capabilities in support of UW. No other Army signal battalion is equipped or has the capabilities of this unique elem ent. When deployed into the often multinational 21st century UW environment, ARSOF may have a need to gi ve limited voice and data access to supporting HN or coalition armed forces w ithin or adjacent to th e UWOA. The 112th Signal"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Supporting Elements and Activities 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 8-3 Battalion (A) can establish classified or unclassified coalitionwide area networks to provide an information network through which coalition forces suppo rting UW can coordinate with ARSOF. C OMMUNICATIONS S UPPORT TO S PECIAL F ORCES 8-8. When a Special Forces group (airborne) (SFG[A]) deploys, it establishes a SOTF or, when augmented by joint SO assets, a JSOTF. The JSOTF or SOTF can have numerous su bordinate SOTFs consisting of SF battalions or Ranger regiment or smaller SO elements and could ev en have attached conventional forces for specific missions. 8-9. The JSOTF or SOTF establishes a C2 and suppo rt base, operated with organic and attached resources, primarily for planning and coordinating SOF under its control . The JSOTF or SOTF provides C2 to subordinate SOTFs, advanced operational bases (AOBs), and selected independent S FODAs for extremely sensitive or compartmented missions. In add ition to reachback and internal communications, the JSOTF or SOTF must integrate and synchronize its operations with other SOF and theater conventional operations. SF battalions can also establish JSOTFs or SOTFs and provide similar C2 support. When the U.S. military employs SFODBs as AOBs, they can serve as terminati ng base stations for C2 of deployed SFODAs. 8-10. In UW, the U.S. military typically deploys SFODAs in areas that are host ile or denied. This makes communication requirements more challenging because of the need to oper ate in a clandestine, covert, or low-visibility manner. Since UW, by definition, will in volve support of irregulars, SF can use innovative combinations of U.S. and irregular communication methods. FM 3-05.201 contai ns more information on special communications. C OMMUNICATIONS S UPPORT TO C IVIL A FFAIRS 8-11. CA forces normally operate from several primary and secondary sites, such a s— A G-9/S-9 staff within or near the main command post. It coordinates current o perations, plans, and technical support. A G-9/S-9 staff within or near the rear command post. It coordinates foreign nation support, dislocated civilian operations, and transition planning. One or more CMOCs. These centers coordinate requests for assistance from government organizations, NGOs, international organizations, and civil ians. Various nonmilitary locations where CA liaison duties or planning expertise are required. 8-12. In UW, communicators must anticipate the requirements for both int eroperability of U.S. communications with non-U.S., nonstandard systems (which may be seriously de graded) and the likelihood of rendering advice and support on rehabilitation of indigenous communication infrastructure in the UWOA as part of the CAO plan. C OMMUNICATIONS S UPPORT TO P SYCHOLOGICAL O PERATIONS 8-13. Army signal doctrine dictates that communications responsibil ities go from “higher to lower,” from “left to right,” and from supporting to supported unit. However, PSYO P communications requirements are inherently joint and interagency in nature and, as an echelon-above-corps unit, PSYOP units will require connectivity from the deployed lo cation back to the su staining base. This requirement may place extraordinary communications demands upon an undeveloped theater in a tim e of crisis. Therefore, commanders should adhere to the following principles when planning PSYOP in a theater. There are three distinct functions that must be supported by communications for PSYOP forces to be successful: C2. Intelligence. Distribution. 8-14. When elements from the 4th POG(A) are empl oyed, these forces possess their own organic equipment and communications personnel. However, PSYOP forces may require a dditional augmentation"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 8-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 and assistance from the supported GCC, SOC, JTF, or th e 112th Signal Battalion (A ). Because of these support requirements, it is often n ecessary to collocate part of the PS YOP force with the supported HQ. 8-15. For C2 and intelligence, PSYOP forces will normally operate or coor dinate for periodic access of the following systems and networks: Local area network of the supported command. SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network and Non-Secure Internet Protocol Route r Network of the Defense Information Systems Network. 8-16. PSYOP forces have the capability to integrate thei r tactical communications devices into future and legacy Army communications networks. PSYOP forces will always bring their own video distribution network to the JOA or AOR. Some networks used and planned for use by PSYOP forces incl ude the following: Single-channel TACSAT. International maritime satellite. Global Broadcast System/Joint Intratheater Injection System. Product distribution system (PDS). C-, X-, and Ku-band satellite communications (SATCOM). 8-17. PSYOP forces may depend upon the communica tions capabilities of other Service component commands to support the PSYOP mission. For example, if USN transportable amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio broadcas t system dissemination capabilities are used, the Naval Component Command must provide organic compa tible communications to receive a udio products fo r dissemination. However, should SOF aviation units, such as the 193d Special Operati ons Wing (SOW), EC-130E/J COMMANDO SOLO, deploy to an undeveloped intermediate staging base , PSYOP forces will provide required distribution communications for the 193d SOW to receive and disse minate audio and video PSYOP products. 8-18. PSYOP forces coordinate bandwidth requirements with the J-6 of the sup ported GCC, not the supported JTF. This early coordination ensures support throughout the AOR and deconflicts PSYOP communications requirements early during contingency planning. 8-19. PSYOP communicators must coordinate and manage the frequency spectrum under the di rection of the J-6 of the supported GCC and JTF. PSYOP co mmunicators participate in the joint-restricted frequency-list coordination process with the supported command’s J-6, l ike any other functional or Service component command. This process assigns C2 frequencies. However, the coordina tion between the electronic warfare officer, the primar y electronic support planner of th e IO cell, the J-2, the primary electronic surveillance planner of the CCDR or JTF, and the PSYOP communi cator must be fully integrated to ensure capabilities are maximized and priorities are established. Allocation of targeted frequencies for dissemination must be coordinated as part of the electro nic countermeasures support to the targeting process, in conjunction with the inte lligence, operations, and fire support communities. 8-20. The PDS provides PSYOP forces with an organic, high-bandwidth-capable, secure/nonsecure, fully interoperable, MC SATCOM system for product distribution. This SATCOM sy stem links all PSYOP elements on a near-real-time basis. The PDS enable s commanders to receive timely, situation-specific PSYOP products. The PDS also enables video production units to produce requir ed products and disseminators to quickly receive and relay commercial broadcast-quality products to the intended audience. 8-21. In UW, communications support to PSYOP may in clude utilization and manipulation of non-U.S., nonstandard media. The area assessment should include detailed considerat ion of communications capabilities and coverage indigenous to or capable of influencing the UWOA. LOGISTICS SUPPORT 8-22. Logistics during UW presents unique challenges for ARSOF units. Caref ul planning and coordination—both with normal supply channels and other available government agenc ies—help to diminish these challenges and sustain the force. The SB(SO)(A) serves as the pr imary logistics operator"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Supporting Elements and Activities 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 8-5 and advisor to the USASOC commander and primarily focuses on operational to tact ical logistical support. When deployed, the SB(SO)(A) acts as the si ngle logistics command element for a JSOTF. 8-23. As soon as practical, the Theater Sustainment Command (TSC) or Expedit ionary Sustainment Command (ESC) will release the SB(SO)(A) making it available for redeplo yment to the continental United States or to another theater. An ARSOF suppor t cell will remain in-theater and embed itself within the TSC or ESC Distribution Management Center and become the forward SB(SO )(A) logistical element for ARSOF, synchronizing logistic support for JSOTF operations. ARSO F liaison elements are assigned to the SB(SO)(A) in direct support of the TSOC, with duty at the ASCC, coordinating logistic plans for Army-provided common-user logistics support for deployed AR SOF and joint SOF where the Army is the executive agent. This coordination chain will typically not be co llocated with ARSOF elements within the UWOA. 8-24. In UW, ARSOF and joint force commanders responsible for a desi gnated UWOA cannot assume that logistical requirements will be met entirely through standard U.S. procedures. The SB(SO)(A) is required to anticipate, coordinate, facilitate, and execute unorthodox logistic al procedures as needed through JIIM partners, both inside and outside of the UWOA. Such nonstandard logistical requirements must be identified early in the planning process, assume clos e interagency cooperation, and require flexibility and ingenuity. T HE A UXILIARY 8-25. The auxiliary is the clandestine support element of the guerrilla force. As with the underground, the auxiliary is often a cellular organization that can be either rural - or urban-based. Functions of the auxiliary include the following: Security and early warning. Intelligence collection. CI operations. Recruitment of new personnel. Air or maritime reception support. Communications. PSYOP. PRS. Support of evasion and escape mechanisms. Internal logistics and medical support. Fund-raising. Augmentation. S UPPLY 8-26. Supply requirements—whether for a resistance elemen t or a surrogate force for UW against nonstate actors—should be established during initial planning. Regulatory require ments limit the types of supplies (specifically, lethal aid) that the DOD can provide to a resistance organi zation or a foreign surrogate force. Coordination with other agencies of the USG is required to procure lethal aid supplies, which DOD can then transport and deliver. 8-27. Local procurement of supplies generally provides a more favorable OPSEC posture. Lo cal procurement includes coordination through the auxiliary to leverage it s internal logistic system of barter, purchase, levy, or seizure. All elements of the UW fo rce can accomplish battlefield recovery. Aerial as well as other forms of resupply may be used, but eac h technique presents unique challenges during UW. Maintaining the security of the DZ (from both the enemy and civilians) is paramount. During OEF, for example, there were several instances of civilians rushing int o DZs to procure items contained in the resupply bundles."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 8-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 C ACHES AND M ISSION S UPPORT S ITES 8-28. Caches are hidden storage places for supplies and equipment. When properly planned and established, caches permit ARSOF and irregular forc es considerable freedom to operate throughout the UWOA, independent of their base areas. Caches reduce the amount of supplies UW elements must carry, thus enhancing foot mobility. Caches are located to support projected operatio ns. 8-29. An MSS is a temporary base used by personnel who are away from their base camp during an operation for periods in excess of two days. The MSS may provide food, shelter, medical s upport, ammunition, or demolitions. The use of an MSS elimin ates unnecessary movement of supplies and allows the irregular force to move more ra pidly to and from target sites. H OSPITALS AND M EDICAL O PERATIONS 8-30. Medical operations in support of UW conserve the fighting strength of guerrilla forces and help secure the support of the local population for U.S. and guerrilla forces oper ating within the UWOA. Medical requirements within the UWOA differ from t hose posed by a conventional force in two key areas: Guerrilla forces typically su ffer fewer battle casualties. Guerrilla forces typically have higher incidences of disease and malnutrition. 8-31. In UW, commanders must tailor the organization of me dical elements to fit the particular situation. Depending upon the required skills, organizers may be able to bring personne l from other medical units into the UWOA. The basic medical organization may also expand by using guerrilla force members and recruiting professional medical personnel to establish and operate guerrilla hospitals. 8-32. Clandestine facilities are, at first, confined to emergency and expedient care with minimum preventive medicine. Once the area command develops sufficien tly, the clandestine facilities can expand and become part of the unit’s medical organization. Wounded guerrillas that fall into enemy hands may reveal critical intelligence that may compromise the mission . Patients with appropriate cover stories may infiltrate civilian or enemy m ilitary hospitals to receive car e not otherwise available. A DMINISTRATIVE I SSUES 8-33. Generally, not every group requires every routine administrative procedure . The prior development of the organization, its requirements, and the requirem ents of the theater and US G dictate the administrative procedures employed. F UNDING 8-34. Section 1208, Support of Military Operations to Combat Terrorism (1 November 2004), of Public Law 108-375, FY05 National Defense Authorization Act, au thorizes the SecDef up to $25 million per year to provide support to foreign forces, irregular forces, groups, or individuals e ngaged in supporting or facilitating ongoing military operations by U.S. SOF to combat terrorism.

Before any UW deployment, ARSOF must acquire as much medical information as pos sible to ensure that the medical intelligence about the UWOA is current. This information will aid infiltrating detachments in developing a more thorough mission-planning profile. M EDICAL A REA S TUDY 8-38. SFODA medics prepare medical area studies of the UWOA as part of the overall detachment area study. Sources used to prepare this study include CA area studies (avai lable through the CA database), OGA-provided information, and reports by UN agen cies and NGOs operating in the area. Because this study is continuous, the SFODA medic updates applicable portions whenever he re ceives new medical intelligence. 8-39. Below is a general outline for a medical area study; the format is flexib le enough to allow SFODA medics to tailor the report as required: General. Provide a brief summary of the nation’s health status. Environmental Health Factors. Discuss the country’s topography and climate, to include effects on health, medical evacu ation, and logistics. Demographics. Include population, ethnic groups, life expectancy, and infant mortalit y. Nutrition. Discuss nutrition and facilities for refrig eration and food inspection programs. Water Supply. Discuss the method of supply, location, treatment, and health hazards of water as they apply to drinking, bathing, and swimming. Fauna of Medical Importance. Discuss disease vectors, host s, reservoirs, and poisonous mammals, reptiles, and spiders. Flora of Medical Importance . Cover poisonous plants, plants with medical value, and edible plants used for survival. Epidemiology. Discuss prevalent diseases and their cont ributing factors. Focus on diseases of military importance, including communicable diseases and susce ptibility to cold and heat injury. Discuss concerns of indigenous personnel, such as physical characteristics, unique attitudes, dress, religious taboos, and psychological attributes. Discuss preventa tive veterinary medicine programs that deal with prevalen t animal diseases and diseases that animals can give to humans. Public Health and Military Medical. Focus on public health an d military medical services. Village Organization. Cover such important village concerns as social, physical, and famil y organization; housing; diet; water and waste disp osal; local medicinal practices; and rapport with neighboring tribes. Domestic Animals. Discuss the types and uses of domestic animals and any possible religi ous symbolism or taboos with these animals. M EDICAL A REA A SSESSMENT 8-40. The initial medical area assessment begins immediately upon i nfiltration. The SFODA medic, using needed medical skills, establishes rapport with the lo cal population and irregular forces. The medic seizes valuable opportunities to collect intelligence and information not re adily available elsewhere. Such information might include captured medical order-of -battle intelligence from medical supplies, documents obtained through battlefield recovery, and intelligence garnered fro m indigenous sources. The SFODA medic uses the assessment to evaluate the actual exte nt of medical training for the irregular force, the availability of medical supplies and facilities, and the state of the sanitation and health within the UWOA. 8-41.

M EDICAL E LEMENTS W ITHIN THE U NCONVENTIONAL W ARFARE O PERATIONS A REA 8-42. Historically, the lack of proper medical attention l eads to serious illness and disability and results in reduced irregular unit combat and irregular organizationa l effectiveness. Health st andards in many areas are well below those of the United States. Indigenous personnel may refuse treatment because of religious beliefs or superstitions. Also, certain natives may have an acquired immunity to diseases of the area. 8-43. Sometimes, a broad range of medical support may already be availabl e in the UWOA. Although initial treatment may be limited to rudimentary medi cal procedures, some irregular forces may have developed highly organized and effective medical support units and installat ions. Their organizations typically parallel those of conventional forces, includin g the establishment of field hospitals in inaccessible areas. Medical Requirements 8-44. Medical elements that support irregular forces must be mobile, responsive, and effective to prevent disease and restore the sick and wounded to duty. In many instances, there is no safe rear area where guerrilla forces can bring casualties for treatment. Wounded and sick personnel in such environments become tactical rather than logis tical problems. Medical support must be a major tactical consideration when planning all operations. The civilian infrastructure of the irregular organization contributes to medical support by setting up and operating medical facilities. Medical personnel help during guerrilla combat operations by establishing casualty collection points, thereby p ermitting the remaining members of the guerrilla force to continue fighting. Casualties at these collection points are evacuated to a guerrilla base or a civilian care facility when possible. 8-45. In UW scenarios, the attitudes of the sick and wounded are extremely imp ortant. The emotional importance the individual soldier attributes to the medical service goes a l ong way toward care and treatment. When presented with difficult conditions, medical personnel do not lower standards of care. Experience has demonstrated that a soldier can under go major surgery under extreme hardship conditions and still demonstrate remarkable recuperative power. Medical Net 8-46. Medical personnel keep the medical net in the UWOA as simple as possible. The medical net entails just enough to provide security and fit the estimated future expansion of the UW OA. Medical personnel refine and modify the net after it is functioning and secure. When establishing a medical net, personnel must consider the following: The scale of activities already in existence and those planned. The potential increase in strength, activities, and operations . The physical factors, includ ing topography, climate, transportation, and communications. The number, availability, and dependability of medically qualified (and semi-qualified) personnel in the UWOA. The attitude of the population, the government, and the irregular organiz ation toward medical problems and the medical standards accepted in the area. The existing nonmedical operationa l facilities of the area command. 8-47. Medical personnel may use the existing intelligence and security nets to establish a separate medical net for the collection of medical intelligence. They may also use t he existing logistics net to aid in the transport of medical supplies. 8-48. UW operations typically include some level of bu ildup in the irregular organization and guerrilla force, to include the fo rce multiplication of irregular medical providers throughout the med ical net. Depending on the situation and operational requirem ents, the SFODA medic—supported by the larger ARSOF organization—begins medical training of irregular forces at th e earliest possible opportunity. FM 3-05.201 contains more detailed information on irregular medical force tr aining."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Supporting Elements and Activities 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 8-9 Aid Station 8-49. Mission planning includes the positioning and operation of an aid station. Medical perso nnel provide emergency medical treatment at this location, and it is here that the e vacuation of wounded personnel from a battle begins. Because the conditi on of the wounded may preclude movement to the unit base, medical personnel may need to hide the injured in secure loca tions while they notify the auxiliary. The auxiliary can then care for and hide the wounded or evacuate them to a treatment facility when the opportunity arises. As the UWOA develops and the situation increa singly favors the sponsor, evacuation of the more seriously injured or diseased personnel to friendly areas by clandesti ne air evacuation or other means may become possible. Convalescent Facility 8-50. The area where medical personnel send patients to recuperate is the convalescent facility. Medical personnel discharge patients from a convalescent fac ility as quickly as possibl e. Convalescent facilities may be located in a safe house, where one or two conva lescents may recuperate with their necessary cover stories; they may be located in any base camp in gu errilla-controlled areas or ev en outside of the UWOA. Guerrilla Hospital 8-51. The guerrilla hospital is a medical treatment fac ility (MTF) or complex of smaller facilities that provides inpatient medical support to the guerrilla fo rce. A guerrilla hospital is established during the classic organization and buildup phases of a resistance organi zation. The guerrilla hospital must be ready for operation at the start of any combat operations and must continue to provide medical support until directed otherwise. The hospital is generally located in the UWOA i t supports; ho wever, considerations of METT-TC may dictate otherwise. An indigenous medical officer—with advice and assistance of the U.S. SF group or battalion surgeon—will typically command the guerrilla hospital, although circumstances within the UWOA may require the group or battalion surgeon to serve as the commander. 8-52. The guerrilla hospital rarely (if ever) outwardly resembles a conventiona l hospital. The requirement for strict security, flexibility, and rapid mobility precludes visible comparison with conventiona l military or civilian MTFs. As the irregular forces consolidate their hold on the UW OA, all medical support functions also tend to consolidate. Safe ar eas allow the establishment of a ce ntralized system of medical care. Sophisticated hospitals permit care that is more elaborate, because they provide a wider selection of trained personnel, specialized equipment, and the capability of more ex tensive and prolonged treatment. Guerrilla hospital considerations include the following: Location. Security. Communications. Medical supplies. Sections. AVIATION SUPPORT 8-53. The SOAR is an integral part of ARSOF. Special operations aviation (SOA) units can operate as part of a SOTF or a JSOTF. They give the ground comm ander a means to infiltrate, resupply, and extract ARSOF. Since irregular forces supported in UW would rarely have aviation assets during the conduct of a UW campaign, SOAR support of ARSOF in UW resembles support to other SO i n virtually all aspects. To properly employ the SOAR, commanders must understand the characteristics of SO in general and SOAR support of ARSOF UW in particular. M ISSION 8-54. The mission of the 160th SOAR in UW is to plan, conduct, and support ARSOF by clandesti nely penetrating nonhostile, hostile, or denied airspace. Th e SOAR conducts air operations to support UW in any operational environment acros s the spectrum of conflict."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 8-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 M ISSION -E SSENTIAL AND B ATTLE T ASKS P ERTINENT TO U NCONVENTIONAL W ARFARE 8-55. The mission-essential and battle tasks for SOAR pertinent to UW a re to— Infiltrate, resupply, and ex filtrate U.S. ARSOF and other selected personnel. Insert and extract ARSOF land and maritime assault vehicles and vess els. Conduct DA or close air support (CAS) using organic attack helicopters to pro vide aerial firepower and terminal guidance for precision munitions, unilaterally or with other ARSOF. Provide forward air control for U.S. and multin ational CAS and indirect fires in support of ARSOF UW. Conduct SR missions in support of ARSOF UW. Conduct electronic, photographi c, and visual reconnaissanc e in support of ARSOF UW. Conduct limited electronic warfare (EW) in support of ARSOF UW. Recover personnel or sensitive ma teriel in support of ARSOF. Conduct assisted evasion and recovery when dedi cated combat search and rescue (CSAR) assets are unavailable in support of ARSOF. Perform emergency air evacuation of ARSOF personnel during the conduct of U W. Conduct ARSOF water insertion and recovery operations in support of UW . Support and facilitate ground and aerial comma nd, control, communications, computers, and intelligence operations for ARSOF UW. Provide the C2 element, when augmented w ith required USAF assets, specialties, and communications equipment, for SOA assets and attached convention al aviation assets supporting ARSOF UW. E MPLOYMENT C ONSIDERATIONS 8-56. The SOAR provides ARSOF the capability to penetrat e hostile or denied territory and to accomplish UW missions. SOAR units have specialized aircraft w ith sophisticated state-of -the-art special mission equipment. SOAR aircrews undergo intense training in the tactical employment of the aircraft and the execution of SOA tasks. The SOAR supports the JFC’s UW campaign plan th roughout all phases, throughout the spectrum of conflict, and inside or outside of any designated UWOA. T he SOAR should exploit the darkness, adverse weather conditions, and extended range and navigatio n systems to penetrate hostile territory from unexpected avenues of approach in the executi on of tasks that support the UW campaign. Although organic SOAR assets can support most required tasks in UW, occasionally the need for flexibility and the limited range of rotary-wing assets will requ ire support from sister Services. Moreover, the requirement for low visibility of ma ny UW operations may require SOAR support from OGA-provided aviation assets. 8-57. SOAR missions and activities fall into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct contact with the adversary applies military resources to accomplish a task without relying on indigenous or surrogate forces not under direct U.S. control. Indirect contact with the adversary applies military resources to train, advise, or assist interagency activities, nations important to U. S. interests, or irregular surrogate forces pursuing objectives that further U.S. interests. These categ ories are not mutually exclusive. However, SOAR activities in UW will be predominantly in support of ARSOF interaction with irregular forces; direct contact with the adversary in UW will be the exception. 8-58. During UW, the SOAR supports the commander by conducting air movement of supported ARSOF teams, indigenous forces, and supplies. These air movements require the SOAR to conduct covert or clandestine penetration, precision navigation, and lo ng-range infiltration and exfiltration. The SOAR can extract U.S., allied, or irregular personnel recovered by the unconventional assist ed-recovery mechanism, a capability which is particularly relevant to UW. In addition, the SOA R can provide training and other support to irregular forces using nonstandard aviation platforms, equipme nt, and procedures. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 A-1 Appendix A The Diplomatic Instrument of National Power INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SYSTEM A-1. Throughout history, mankind has existed in an environment of informational (cultural , philosophical, religious, mythical, and so on) and economic competition and a spectrum of conflic t ranging from individual duels to societal wars of annihilation. This was an essentiall y anarchic environment, and force was the final judge between competition and conflict. Through nat ural development and for mutual protection, groups formed around kinship, ethnicity, and shared mythology and developed into historically identifiable bands, clans, tribes, and nations (“peoples” ) to compete and conflict mo re effectively. Starting in early modern Europe, many people recognized these groups as distinct sove reign states, increasingly aligned over time with a perceived distinct national identity. I NTERNATIONAL S YSTEM OF S TATES A-2. A state is a set of institutions that possess the authority to make t he rules that govern the people in one or more societies, having internal sovereignty ov er a definite territory. The state includes institutions, such as the armed forces, civil serv ice or state bureaucracy, courts, and police. By Max Weber's influential definition, a state has a “monopoly on the legitimate use of physica l force within a given territory.” By modern practice and the law of international relations, a state’s sovere ignty is not conditional upon the diplomatic recognition of the state’s claim to independence by other states. However , the capacity of a state to enter into various international relations and trea ties is conditional upon such recognition. Degrees of recognition and sovereignty may vary. However, any degree of recognition, even the majority recognition, is not binding on third-party states. A-3. Within sovereign states, the ruling government uses all of the instru ments of national (“state”) power on its own people. The government is the political authority; it esta blishes and enforces the law, manages and develops the economy and allocates state fina nces, disseminates state-supporting information and gathers internal intelligence, and relies on the military as the final guarantor of internal state power. A-4. Although the term often refers broadly to all in stitutions of government or rule—ancient and modern—the modern state system bears a number of characteristics that first consolidated in Western Europe, beginning in earnest in the 17th century. Since the late 19th century, a ll of the world’s inhabitable land has been parceled up into states; earlier, quite large land areas had be en either unclaimed or uninhabited or inhabited by nomadic peoples who were not organized as sta tes. A-5. Governments now used the same instruments of power that they had previ ously used internally against other states in interstate competition and conflict in an otherwise anarchic international environment. State gov ernments could em ploy each of these instruments as a weapon in pursuit of their own interests. Despite the increased power of stat es, the international environment was still largely anarchic with each sovereign state in terpreting international conduct by its own calculation. Using a mix of power instruments, groups of states formed ever-shif ting blocks of alliance in the pursuit of advantage. A-6. After the world wars of the 20th century, participating nations formed the U N. An increasing body of international law sought to reduce the anarchy in th e international environment. Today’s international environment is characterized by stat es—constrained by international law—using all of their instrumen ts of national power for competition and conflict. A-7. In the late 20th century, the globalization of the world economy, the mobi lity of people and capital, and the rise of many international institutions all combined to re strict the freedom of action of states. However, the state remains the basic political unit of the world and, therefore, the state is the most central concept in the study of politics. Currently, more than 200 states mak e up the international community, with the vast majority represented in the UN."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Appendix A A-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 A-8. In casual usage, the terms “country,” “nation,” and “state” are often used synonymously, but in a more strict usage, they are distinguished as follows: Country is the geographical area. Nation designates a people; however, national and international both confusingly refer as well to matters pertaining to what are strictly states, as in national capi tal or international law. State refers to a set of governing institutions with sovereignty over a definite territory. C URRENT G LOBAL G OVERNANCE S YSTEM A-9. The UN is the primary formal organization coordi nating activities between states on a global scale and the only intergovernmental organization with a truly universal me mbership (192 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the World Health Organization, the International Labor Organi zation (ILO), and International Telecommunications Union. Of particular interest politically are the WB, the IMF, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). A-10. The WB and the IMF were formed together in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire i n 1944 to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by fi nancially assisting states in need. The WTO sets the rules of international trade. It has a semilegislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another in fluential international economic organization is the OECD, with a membership of 30 democratic members . A less formal but highly influential organization in global politics is the G8, an associa tion of eight of the richest and most technologically advanced democracies in the world. The leaders of th e G8 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies for confronting glob al issues, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change. A-11. Militarily, the UN usually de ploys only peacekeeping forces to bu ild and maintain postconflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ad hoc coalitions (for example, the MNF in Iraq) or regional military alliances (for example, NATO) are typically used. A-12. International law encompasses international treaties, customs, and globally accept ed legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), national courts interpret the laws. The ICJ (also known as the World Court) is the judiciary organ of the UN. It settles disputes voluntarily submitted to it by states (only) and gives advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by other organs of the U N, such as the General Assembly or Security Council. The ICC is a r ecent development in international law; it is the first permanent international criminal court. The ICC was established to ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished. One-hundred and thirty-nine national governments signed the IC C treaty. By October 2005, 100 of those nations had ratified the treaty into law. A-13. In addition to the formal or semiformal internati onal organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms regulate human activities across national bo rders. In particular, international trade in goods, services, and currencies (the “global market”) has a tremendous impa ct on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency among nations t hrough globalization. Transnational (or multinational) co rporations, some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapi d increase in the volume of transborder digital communications and mass-media distribution (for exampl e, the Internet and satellite television [TV]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws. INTERNATIONAL LAW A-14. Codified or habitual relations and conduct between nations has de veloped over millennia of “natural law.” The first formal attempts to develop modern in ternational law stem from renaissance Europe and the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Diplomatic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 A-3 gradual development of the European national state. By the beginning of the 17t h century, several generalizations could be made about the political situation: Self-governing, autonomous states existed; th e Peace of Westphalia established states as sovereigns answering to no one within their own borders. Monarchs governed almost all states. Land, wealth, and trading rights were ofte n the topics of wars between states. A-15. The growth of nationalism in the 19th century pushed natural law farther from th e legal realm. Commercial law became nationalized into private international law, distinct from public international law. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 marked formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe. A-16. After World War I, many states decided to form an international League of Na tions in the hope of preventing such conflicts. However, because of political wranglin g in the U.S. Congress, the United States did not join the League of Nations, even though it was an initiative of U.S. President Wilson. When WWII broke out, the League of Nations foundered. Nevertheless, on 1 January 1942, U .S. President Roosevelt issued the “declaration by united nations” on behalf of 26 nations that had pledged t o fight against the axis powers. Even before the end of the war, representatives of 50 nations met in San Francisco, California, to draw up the charter for an international body to re place the League of Nations. On 24 October 1945, the UN officially came into existence, setting a basis for much internati onal law to follow. A-17. In a global economy, law is global too. International law plays an incre asingly important part in people’s lives. The goods bought, the services cons umed, and the work done by people are increasingly integrated with people far across the planet. In ternational law can refer to three things: Public international law. Private international law or conflict of laws. Law of supranational organizations. P UBLIC I NTERNATIONAL L AW A-18. Public international law concerns the structure and conduct of sta tes and international organizations. The UN, founded under the UN charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is the most important international organization. Other international agreements, like the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war and international bodies, such as the IL O, the WTO, or the IMF, also form a growing part of public international law. To a lesser degree, interna tional law also affects multinational corporations and individuals, an impact increasingly evolving beyond do mestic legal interpretation and enforcement. Public international law has increased in use and importance vastly over the 20th century , mainly because of the increase in global trade, armed conflict, environmen tal deterioration on a worldwide scale, human rights violations, rapid and vast increases in international transportation, an d a boom in global communications. Public international law also is also known as the “law of nati ons.” Public international law is not the same as “private international law,” which is conc erned with the resolution of conflicting laws. Scope of Public International Law A-19. Public international law establishes the framework and the criteria for identifying states as the principal actors in the international legal system. The existence of a state presupposes control and jurisdiction over territory. International law deals with the acquisition of territory, state immunity, and the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with eac h other. International law is similarly concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. Thus, there is a compre hensive regime dealing with group rights, treatment of aliens, rights of refugees , international crimes, nationality problems, and human rights in general. This regime further includes the important functio ns of the maintenance of international peace and security, arms control, the peaceable settlement of disputes, and the regula tion of the use of force in international relations. Even when the law is not able to stop the outbreak of war, it has developed principles to govern the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of prisoners. A-20. International law also governs issues relating to th e global environment, the global commons, such as international waters, outer space, global communications, and world trade. Whereas municipal law is"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Appendix A A-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 hierarchical or vertical in its stru cture (meaning that a legislature enact s binding legislation), international law is horizontal in nature (meaning that all states are sovereign and theo retically equal). As a result of the notion of sovereignty, the value and authority of international law is dependent upon the voluntary participation of states in its formulation, observan ce, and enforcement. Althou gh there may be exceptions, most states enter into legal commitments with other states out of enlightened self-interest rather than adherence to a body of law that is higher than their own. A-21. Breaches of international law raise difficult questions for lawyers and statesmen. Since international law has no established compulsory judicial system for the settlement of disputes or a coercive penal system, managing breaches of international law is not as straightforward as managi ng breaches within a domestic legal system. However, there are ways that parties bring breaches to the attention of the international community, and there are ways to resolve conflict. Fo r example, there are judi cial or quasi-judicial tribunals in international law for certain areas, such as trade and human rights. The founders of the UN, for example, created the organization as a means for th e world community to enforce international law upon members that violate its charte r through the Security Council. A-22. Traditionally, states and the Vatican were the sole subjects of i nternational law. With the proliferation of international organizations over the la st century, some organizations have been recognized as relevant parties as well. Recent interpretations of international human ri ghts law, international humanitarian law, and international trade law have been inclusive of corporat ions, and even of certain individuals. Sources of International Law A-23. Public international law has three primary sources : international treaties, customary, and general principles of law. International treaty law includes obligatio ns states expressly and voluntarily accept between themselves in treaties. Customary international law derives from the consistent practice of states accompanied by legal opinion that legal obligation re quires the consistent practice. Those practicing international law traditionally look to judgments of in ternational tribunals, as well as scholarly works, as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior. Attempts to codify customary international law gained momentum afte r WWII with the formation of the International Law Commission (ILC), under the guidance of the UN. The binding interpre tation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty codifies cust omary law. For states not party to such treaties, the work of the ILC may still be accepted as custom applying to those states. General principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world. Certain norms of inte rnational law achieve binding force to include all states with no permissible deviations. When there are disputes about the exact meaning and application of national laws, it is the responsibility of the courts to decide what the law means. In international law, there are no courts with the authority to do this. It is generally the responsibility of states to interpret the law for themselves. Unsurprisingly, this means that the re is rarely agreement in cases of dispute. A-24. Since international law exists in a legal environment without a n overarching “sovereign,” enforcement of international law is very different from enforcement in th e domestic context. In many cases, enforcement takes on charac teristics where the norm is self-enforci ng. In other cases, defection from the norm can pose a real risk, particularly if the international environment i s changing. When this happens and enough states (or enough powerful states) continually ignore a particular as pect of international law, the norm may actually change according to concepts of customary internati onal law. A-25. Apart from a state’s natural inclination to uphold certain norms, th e force of international law has always come from the pressure that states put upon one another to behave consis tently and to honor their obligations. As with any system of law, many violatio ns of international law obligations are overlooked. If addressed, it is usually done purely through diplomacy and the consequences of un wanted behavior upon an offending state’s reputation. Though violations may be common in fact, states try to avoid the appearance of having disregarded international obligations. States may al so unilaterally adopt sanctions against one another, such as the severance of economic or diplomatic ties or through reciprocal action. In some cases, domestic courts may render judgment agains t a foreign state (the real m of private international law) for an injury, though this is a complicated area of law where intern ational law intersects with domestic law.

States may also use force in collective self-defense against another state. A-26. The primary branches of public international law today include— International criminal law. Use-of-force law. International human rights law. International humanitarian law. Maritime law. Diplomatic law. Consular law. State responsibility law. International environmental law. International trade law. International space law. International aviation law. P RIVATE I NTERNATIONAL L AW A-27. Private international law (or conflict of laws) is th at branch of international law and interstate law that regulates all lawsuits involving a “foreign la w” element, where a difference in result will occur depending on which laws are applied. First, it is concerned with determini ng whether the proposed forum has jurisdiction to adjudicate and is the appropriate venue for dealing with the dispute. Second, it is concerned with determining which of the competing st ate’s laws the determining body will use to resolve the dispute. It also deals with the enforcement of foreign judgments. The object is the resolution of conflicts between competing law systems rather th an resolution of the conflict itself. S UPRANATIONAL L AW A-28. The European Union (EU) is the only example of a supranational legal framework, where sovereign nations have pooled their authority through a system of courts and poli tical institutions. It constitutes a new legal order in international law intended for the mutual social a nd economic benefit of the member states. EU law operates alongside the laws of the member states that have chosen by consent to limit some of their sovereign rights within certain limited fields. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS A-29. An international organization, or more formally IGO, is an organization, s uch as the European Community or the WTO, with sovereign states or other IGOs as members. Such organizations function according to the principles of inte rgovernmentalism, which means that unanimity is required. NGOs are private organizations that can also be international in scope. Generally a nd correctly used, however, the term “international organization” is reserved for intergovernmental organiz ations only. L EGAL N ATURE A-30. Legally speaking, a treaty must establish an international organi zation, which provides it with legal recognition. International organizations so established are subjects of internationa l law, capable of entering into agreements among themselves or with states. Thus, international o rganizations in a legal sense are distinguished from mere groupings of states, such as the G8 and the G-77, neither of which have been founded by treaty, though in nonlegal contexts these are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well. International organizations must also be distinguished from treaties; although all international organizations are founded on a treaty, many treaties (for example, the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA ]) do not establish an international organization and rely purely on the member parties for their administration."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Appendix A A-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 M EMBERSHIP AND F UNCTION A-31. International organizations differ in function, membership, and membershi p criteria. Membership of some organizations (global organizations) is open to all the n ations of the world. This category includes the UN and its specialized agencies and the WTO. Othe r organizations are only open to members from a particular region or continent of the world, like the EU, African Union, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and so on. Finally, some organizations base their membership on other criteria, such as— Cultural or historical links (for example, the Commonwealth of Nations, la Francophonie, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, and the Latin Union). Level of economic development or type of economy (for example, OECD and Organiza tion of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC]). Religion (for example, Organization of the Islamic Conference). Were it to come about, the ultimate international organization would be a federal world government. Global and Regional Organizations A-32. Examples of global organizations include the following: UN, its specialized agencies, and associated organizations. International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). International Hydrographic Organization. WTO. Universal Postal Union. International Red Cross (IRC) and Red Crescent movement. Figures A-1 through A-3, pages A-6 and A-7, show examples of regional organizations. Financial International Organizations A-33. Examples of financial international organizations include the following: Bank for International Settlements. IMF. The WB group. Figure A-1.

Several smaller regional orga nizations with nonoverlapping memberships Figure A-3. Several nonoverlapping large alliances Nongovernmental Organizations A-34. The term “nongovernmental organization” is used in a variety of ways all ove r the world and, depending on the context in which it is used, can refer to many different types of or ganizations. In its broadest sense, an NGO is one that is not directly part of the structur e of government. Depending on how an NGO is defined, they number in the 10,000s to several million worldw ide. History of Nongovernmental Organizations A-35. Though voluntary associations of citizens have existed throughout history, N GOs along the lines seen today, especially on the international level, have developed in the pa st two centuries. One of the first such organizations, the IRC, was founded in 1863. The IRC and Red Crescent movement are the world’s largest group of humanitarian NGOs. The phrase “nongovernmental organiza tion” came into use with the establishment of the UN organization in 1945 with provisions i n Article 71 of Chapter 10 of the UN charter for a consultative role for organizations that are neither governme nts nor member states. Resolution 288(x) of the UN ECOSOC on 27 February 1950 first gives the definition of inte rnational nongovernmental organization. The resolution defines an international nongovernmental orga nization as “any international organization that is not founded by an international treaty.” NOTE: Lighter colors indicate observer/ associate or candidate countries."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Appendix A A-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Types of Nongovernmental Organizations A-36. NGOs are also known by alterna tive terms, such as independent sector, volunteer sector, civic society, grassroots organizations, transnational social movement or ganizations, private voluntary organizations, self-help organizations, and nonstate actors. NGOs are a dis similar group. Some focus on small-scale relief or development, others do the same on much larger scales, and still others are primarily political organizations. The USAID refers to NGOs as “private voluntary organizations.” However, many scholars have argued that this definition is highly problematic as many NG Os are in fact state and corporate funded and projects are managed with professional staffs. A-37. There are also numerous classifi cations of NGOs. The typology the WB uses divides them into operational and advocacy: The primary purpose of an operational NGO is the design and implementation of development-related projects. One categorization that is frequently used is the division into relief-oriented or development-or iented organizations. They can also be classified according to whether they stress service delivery or participati on, whether they are religious or secular, and whether they are more public or private. Oper ational NGOs can be community-based, national, or international. The primary purpose of an advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these orga nizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbyin g, working with the press, and conducting activist events. An example of this type of NGO is Amnesty International, the largest human rights organization in the world. It forms a global community of human rights defenders with more than 1.8 m illion members, supporters, and subscribers in over 150 countries and territories. Purposes and Methods A-38. NGOs exist for a variety of purposes, usually to further the political or s ocial goals of their members or funders. Examples include improving the state of the natural environment, e ncouraging the observance of human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corpor ate agenda. However, there is a huge number of such organizations, and their goals cover a br oad range of political and philosophical positions. These goals can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations. NGOs also vary in their methods. Some primarily act as lobbyists, while othe rs primarily conduct programs and activities. Public Relations A-39. NGOs need healthy relationships with the public to meet thei r goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance be cause of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. Some NGOs seek to mobilize public support. Consulting A-40. Many international NGOs have a consultative status with UN a gencies relevant to their area of work. As an example, the Third World Network has a consu ltative status with the UN Conference on Trade and Development and the ECOSOC. In 1946, only 41 NGOs had consultative status with t he ECOSOC. By 2003, this number had risen to 2,350. Project Management A-41. Management techniques are crucial to project su ccess in NGOs. Generally, private NGOs private have a community or environmental focus. They addre ss a variety of issues such as religion, emergency aid, and humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contri butions for aid. They often have strong links with community groups in developing countries and they often w ork in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. States accept NGOs as a part of th e international relations landscape. While they influence national and multilateral policy-m aking, their direct involvement in local action is increasing."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Diplomatic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 A-9 Funding A-42. Large NGOs may have annual budgets in the millions of dollars. For in stance, the budget of the American Association of Retired Persons was over $540 million dollars in 1999. Human Rights Watch spent and received $21.7 million U.S. dollars in 2003. Funding such large budge ts demands significant fund-raising efforts on the part of most NGOs. Major sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of goods and services, grants from interna tional institutions or national governments, and private donations. Several EU grants pr ovide funds accessible to NGOs. A-43. Even though the term NGO implies independence of governments, some NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding. The EU and the British government donated a quarter of the U.S. $162 million income in 1998 of the famine-relief organization OXFAM. The Chris tian relief and development organization World Vision collected $55 million (U.S.) worth of goods in 1998 fr om the American government. Médecins Sans Frontières (known in English as Doctors Withou t Borders) gets 46 percent of its income from government sources. Legal Status, Criticism, and the Monitoring and Control of N ongovernmental Organizations A-44. NGOs are not legal entities under international law. An exception is the International C ommittee of the Red Cross, which states consider a legal entity under international law because the organization’s basis it the Geneva Convention. In general, states view NGOs as a beneficia l and complementary source filling gaps in society not provided by the public or for-profit sectors. NGOs have als o played a crucial role in upholding international law, especially UN treaties. However, critics argue that although NGOs have good intentions, they undermine outcomes. A-45. Conservative critics have maintained that NGOs too often conflict with states activities, going so far as to subvert government actions, violate the law, and make common cause with criminals and terrorists. Progressive critics have suggested that imperialism and NGOs s hare a fine line. One of the first modern NGOs, for example, was the American Colonization Society that founded Liberia. Other famous examples include various Christian missionaries throughout the Americas, As ia, and Africa during colonial times. A-46. Although most complain t literature is against multilateral or bilateral agencies, there are occasional criticisms of NGO operational strategies and inadvertent adverse impacts. For example, it is often argued that in poorer countries, northern-funded and mana ged NGOs tend to act as substitutes for popular movements in forums, like the World Social Forum, with negative consequences f or the development of local civil society. In many developing countries with dysfunctional economies, entry into the aid industry is the most profitable professional car eer path for young college graduates. As NGOs provide services in the community for free or at subsidized rates (such as training), the private sector is unable to evolve and compete effectively at sustainable levels. If an NGO begins offering products or services for a fee (handicrafts, evaluations, digging wells, counseling, and so on), it eventua lly becomes a competitor with private-sector providers of these sa me services. However, with its do nation-funding support or access to voluntary labor, the NGO has a significant competitive advantage. A-47. Additional areas of concern include co-option (by political or other forces), mission-drift, changing core services based on an ever-changing funding landscape, transparency, accountability, moving beyond a charismatic founding leader, and dono r-driven rather than se lf-defined strategies. New NGOs occasionally receive “do-gooder” complaints of engaging in action to help withou t understanding the full complexity and interplay of issues, which results in more harm than good. UNITED STATES POLITICAL PO WER IN THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT A-48. The international environment includes all modes of human interac tion. This environment is not limited strictly to official political interaction betw een countries. Nevertheless, states generally consider international political power and foreign policy functions of sovereign nat ion-state governments. States primarily contend politically through government-to- government diplomacy and by leveraging the UN and international law against one another."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Appendix A A-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 A-49. A state’s foreign policy is a set of political goals th at seeks to outline how that particular state will interact with other states of the world and, to a lesser extent, non state actors. Politicians generally design foreign policies to help guide and protect a state’s national inte rests, national security, ideological goals, and economic pros perity. Successful foreign policy occurs as the result of peaceful cooperation with other states, wherever possible, through the exploitation of all instruments of na tional power. States may employ the military instrument of power up to the level of general war when differences between states are irreconcilable. The United States also uses the military instrument of power as the ultimate guarantor of U.S. foreign policy. Virtually every state in the world is now able to interact with one another in some diplomatic form. In many states, foreign policy ranks high on the list of factors that influence public opinion. The national and cultural values of all states and the fore ign policy positions and activities that reflect those values have their disputants. Such is th e nature of a large complex world with a troubled and imperfect history, finite resources, and differences of international pers pective. UNITED STATES FOREIGN POLICY A-50. U.S. foreign relations are marked by a large economy, well-funded military, and notable political influence. According to estimates given in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Fact Book, the United States has the world’s largest economy, the wo rld’s most well-funded military, and a large amount of political influence. The officially stated goals of U.S. foreign policy are— Protecting the safety and freedom of all American citizens, both within the United States and abroad. Protecting allied nations of the United States from attack or invasio n and creating mutually beneficial international defense arrangements and partnerships to ensure th is. Promoting peace, freedom (most notably of speech and enterprise), and democracy in al l regions of the world. Furthering free trade, unencumbered by tariffs , interdictions, and other economic barriers, and furthering capitalism to foster economic growth, improve living conditi ons, and promote the sale and mobility of U.S. products to international consumers. Bringing developmental and humanitarian aid to foreign peoples in need. D ECISION M AKING A-51. The President negotiates treaties with foreign states . The President is also Commander in Chief of the military. As the Commander in Chief, the President has broad authority over the armed forces once they deploy. The Secretary of State is the “foreign minister” of the United Stat es and is the primary conductor of state-to-state diplomacy. The U.S. Congress has the po wer to declare war, but th e President has the ability to commit military troops to an area for 60 days without congressional approval (though in all cases, Congress has granted approval afterward). The U.S. Senate also holds the ex clusive right to approve treaties made by the President. Congress is likewise responsible for p assing bills that determine the general character and policies of U.S. foreig n policy. The Supreme Court traditionally has played a minimal role i n foreign policy. D IPLOMATIC R ELATIONS A-52. The United States has one of the largest diplomatic presences of any state. Al most every state in the world has both a U.S. Embassy and an embassy of its own in Washington, DC. O nly a few nations do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States. They are Bhutan, Cuba , Iran, North Korea, Somalia (no widely recognized government), Sudan, Republic of China (Taiwan), and Western Sahara (not recognized). In practical terms, how ever, this lack of formal relations does not impede the United Sta tes’ communication with these states. In areas where no U. S. diplomatic post exists, the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Switzerland, or another friendly third-party na tion conducts American rela tions. In the case of the Republic of China, the American Institute in Taiwan conducts d e facto relations. The United States also operates an Interests Section in Havana. Although this does not creat e a formal diplomatic relationship, it fulfills most other typical embassy functions. The United States maintains a normal trade relations list. There are several states excluded from the list, which means that their exports to the United States are subject to significantly higher tariffs."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Diplomatic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 A-11 A LLIES A-53. The United States is a founding member of NATO, th e world’s largest military alliance. The 26-state alliance consists of Canada and much of Europe. Un der the NATO Charter, the United States is compelled to defend any NATO state attacked by a foreign power. These mutual defense obligations are restricted to within the North American and Europ ean areas, and for this reason, the United States was not compelled to participate in the Falklands War between Argentina and the UK. T he United States has also given major non-NATO ally status to fourteen states. Each such state has a unique relationship with the United States, involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances. INSTRUMENTS OF UNITED ST ATES DIPLOMATIC POWER A-54. The following paragraphs discuss the instruments of official U.S. diploma tic power as contained within the charter of the U.S. Department of State. However, many other USG departments, agencies, and other organizations play an adjunct or de facto diplomatic role under DOS leadersh ip. D EPARTMENT OF S TATE A-55. The DOS leads the United States in its relationships with forei gn governments, international organizations, and the people of other countries. It aims to provid e a free, prosperous, and secure world. The management of these relationships is called diplomacy. Diplomacy is vital t o the United States because it is how the DOS formulates, implements, and represents to other nat ions the foreign policy goals of the President. Diplomacy is vital to U.S. interests. The DOS is a vital part of the USG because it— Represents the United States overseas and conveys U.S. policies to forei gn governments and international organizations through American embassies and consulates in fore ign countries and diplomatic missions. Negotiates and concludes agreements and treatie s on issues ranging from trade to nuclear weapons. Coordinates and supports international activities of other U.S. agenci es, hosts official visits, and performs other diplomatic missions. Leads interagency coordination and manages the allocation of resources f or foreign relations. A-56. There are more than 190 states in the world and the United States maintains diplomatic relations with some 180 of them, as well as with many international organizations. Advan ces in travel, trade, and technology have made the world more interconnected today than ever before, making in teractions with other countries and their citizens more important for the United Stat es. The DOS has four main foreign policy goals: Protect the United States and Americans. Advance democracy, human rights, and other global interests. Promote international understanding of American values and policies. Support U.S. diplomats, government officials, and all other personnel at home and abroad w ho make these goals a reality. A-57. Diplomacy is one of the best ways to protect the United States and the Ameri can people. The United States uses diplomacy with other states of the world to successfully deal with a number of challenges that cross state boundaries and affect Ameri cans in the United St ates, including— Terrorism. WMD. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other infec tious diseases. Illegal drug trafficking and crime. Humanitarian needs of migrants and refugees. Environmental degradation."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Appendix A A-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 A-58. Americans at home and abroad face threats to th eir physical and economic well-being. The DOS protects the nation, its people, and its prosperity by helping to— Prevent terrorist attacks and strengthen interna tional alliances to defeat global terrorism. Ensure America’s homeland security by promoting policies and practices to keep travel, trade, and important infrastructure safe. Provide guidelines to manage the entry of visitors to the United States. Promote stability in all regions of the world. Prevent enemies from threatening the Un ited States or its allies with WMD. Reduce the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on Am ericans. Protect and assist American citizens who travel, conduct business, and live abroad. A-59. The following paragraphs discuss some of the many ways the DOS uses diplom acy to protect America. Fighting Terrorism A-60. After the attacks on 11 September 2001, the United St ates learned firsthand the serious threat it faces from terrorists and from states supporting them. The te rrorists who performed these attacks had no respect for human life or state borders. Terrorists threaten not only Americans but a lso all people who believe in freedom and democracy. They are the enemy of all civiliz ed states. They will be defeated only through the united action of states throughout the world. To provide leadership in the fi ght against terrorism, the DOS works with other U.S. agencies and foreign governments to— Identify terrorist organizations and states that support terrorists. Investigate the activities of terrorist organizations. Shut down terrorist financial networks. Bring terrorists to justice. Department of State Support to Homeland Security A-61. Security for Americans begins at home but extends beyond its borders. In pursuit of homeland security, the DOS conducts visa operations and lead s U.S. diplomatic efforts to gain international cooperation on measures to deter threats to trav el, communications, and other critical infrastructure networks—information systems, transportation, and energy—and to secure America’s bor ders. The DOS also carefully reviews more than 7 million visa applications per year. The visa reg ulations help ensure that no visas are approved for foreign citizens who might harm the nation, thereby keeping A merica safe while continuing to welcome citizens from around the globe. Regional Stability A-62. The DOS uses diplomacy in all regions of the wo rld to keep local conflicts from becoming wider wars that may harm U.S. interests. The DOS joins with other countries in international organizations to promote stability and economic prosperity. Weapons of Mass Destruction A-63. WMD—such as nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons—pose a serious danger to the United States and the world. The United States must be con cerned about the possibility that terrorists may acquire these weapons for use against innocent people. The DOS works to ensure that more countries do not obtain these weapons and to verify that other countries are honoring interna tional agreements restricting such weapons."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Diplomatic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 A-13 Democracy and Human Rights A-64. Democracy and the protection of f undamental liberties were the basis for the creation of the United States more than 200 years ago. Since then, a cent ral goal of U.S. foreign policy has been to promote respect for democracy and human righ ts throughout the world. The DOS— Promotes democracy as a way to achieve security, stability, and prosperity for the entire world. Helps establish and assist newly formed democracies. Identifies and denounces regimes that deny their citizens the right to ch oose their leaders in elections that are free and fair. A-65. Human rights are a crucial foundation to create and maintain democracy. The DOS works to promote human rights in those countries where democr acy is not firmly established. The DOS— Holds governments accountable to their promises to uphol d universal human rights. Promotes greater respect for human rights, incl uding freedom from torture, freedom of speech and other expression, freedom of religion, freedom of press, protection of the rights of women and children, and protection of minorities. Promotes the rule of law, such as fair judicial and voting procedures. Helps reform and strengthen the UN Commission on Human Rights. Coordinates support for human ri ghts with America’s allies. Releases an annual report on human rights practices. Refugees, Migration, and Population Growth A-66. The DOS helps millions of refugees and victims of conflict or natural disasters around the world. Each year, the United States also allows tens of thousands of refugees to live in the United States permanently. Population growth affects the environment and the ability o f governments to provide services to the growing number of people who live in less space, use more fuel, and require more food. There is no country in the world untouched by America, and Ameri ca is touched by every country in the world in some way. American principles of democracy, freedom, tolera nce, and opportunity inspire people throughout the world. Recognition and understanding of these common values increases trust among s tates and peoples and betters the chances of resolving differences and reaching agreements. To achieve this understanding of other people and states, the DOS explains U.S. policies. While ensuring that its voice is heard in foreign affairs, good diplomacy dictates listening to the voices and concerns of other nations and peoples. The most effective way for others to hear the American message is to welcome their views, from which America has much to learn. The DOS provides information to foreign audiences, ofte n in various foreign languages, through TV broadcasts, videos, print publications, and the Internet. Department of State Personnel A-67. Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel have the primary responsibil ity for executing U.S. foreign policy in the United States and at U.S. missi ons abroad. More than 11,000 employees make up the Foreign Service. These employees represent the United States in other countries. The Foreign Service can send its members to any embassy, consulate, or other diplomatic mission anywhe re in the world, at any time, to serve the diplomatic needs of the United States. About 8,000 empl oyees—mostly in Washington, DC—make up the Civil Service. These employees provide expertise, support, and continuity in accomplishing the mission of the department. Some Civ il Service employees are the domestic counterparts to consular officers abroad, issuing passports and assi sting U.S. citizens at home and abroad. U.S. missions abroad are supported by more than 31,000 locally engaged staff, formerly referre d to as Foreign Service National employees, who are citizens of the country in which an embassy or other post is located. These employees provide continuity by remaining in their jobs, while the Foreign Service officers move in and out of the country.

The information environment is the total of individuals, organizations, and syst ems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. The actors include leaders, de cision makers, individuals, and organizations. Resources include the materials and sy stems employed to collect , analyze, apply, or disseminate information. The information environment is where humans and automat ed systems observe, orient, decide, and act upon information, and is therefore the principal environm ent of decision making. Even though the information environment is considered distinct, it resides within each of the four domains of air, land, sea, and space. B-2. The information environment is made up of three interrelated dimensions (Figu re B-1, page B-2): The physical dimension . The physical dimension is made up of the C2 systems and supporting infrastructures that enable individuals and organizations to conduct operations ac ross the four domains. It is also the dimension where physical platforms and th e communications networks that connect them reside, which includes the means of transmission, infrastructure, technologies, groups, and populations. Comparatively, the elements of this dimension are the ea siest to measure, and consequently, combat power has traditionally been measured primarily in this dimension. The informational dimension . The informational dimension is where information is collected, processed, stored, disseminated, displayed, and protected. It is the dimension w here the C2 of modern military forces is communicated, and where commander’s intent i s conveyed. It consists of the content and flow of information. Consequently, it must be protected. The cognitive dimension . The cognitive dimension encompasses the mind of the decisio n maker and the TA. People think, perceive, visualize, and decide in this dimension . It is the most important of the three dimensions. A commander’s orders, training, a nd other personal motivations affect this dimension. Battles and campaigns can be lost in the cognitive dimension. Factors such as leadership, morale, unit cohesion , emotion, state of mind, level of training, experience, situational awareness, as well as public opinion, perceptions, media, public information, and rumors influence this dimension. B-3. Advancements in technology have enabled information to be collected, process ed, stored, disseminated, displayed, and protected outside the cognitive process in quantities and at speeds that were previously incomprehensible. While technology makes great qua ntities of information available to audiences worldwide, perception-affec ting factors provide the context that individuals use to translate data into information and knowledge. B-4. There are criteria that define the quality of inform ation relative to its purpose. The varying purposes of information require different applications of thes e criteria to qualify it as valuable. In addition, each decision relies on a different weighting of the information quality criteri a to make the best decision. The finite amount of time and resources available to obtain information is a considerat ion. Whether decisions are made cognitively or preprogrammed in automated systems, the lim ited time and resources to improve the quality of available information leaves decision making subj ect to manipulation. In addition, there are real costs associated with obtaining quality information—that is, information well-suited to its purpose— such as those to acquire, process, store, transport, and distribute in formation. The overall impact of successful IO improves the quality of friendly inform ation while degrading the quality of adversary information, thus providing friendly forces the ability to make faster, mo re accurate decisions (Figure B-2, page B-2)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Figure B-1.

INTERNATIONAL INFO RMATION PROVIDERS B-6. A medium of information is anything that conveys meaning to a person who perc eives the conveyed information. It includes the symbolic meaning perceived in anything taken in by the one who perceives, to include stationary inanimate objects, nature, or man- made images. It also includes messages sent in human interaction—large or small—regardless of whether the message actu ally delivered was the one intended by the sender or whether the message received was unders tood as the sender intended . Very broadly, anything and anyone can be an information provider, intentionally or uninten tionally. B-7. This manual construes information as an inst rument of power as th e deliberate crafting, manipulation, and dissemination of information to convey an intended messa ge or theme to a large TA. This manual narrowly focuses on media capable of and willing to in fluence audiences in the context of international relations and warfare. The media considered most broadl y and profoundly influential is the so-called mass media. This is in contrast to nonmass, person-to-person, or po int-to-point media, such as conversation, interpersonal gestures, telephony, postal mail, email, and some interactive media. Arguably, blogs and other first-person, Web-based communications are not mass media. B-8. Media (the plural of medium) is a shortened version of the term “media of comm unication,” referring to those organized means of dissemination of fact, opinion, entertainment, and other inform ation, such as newspapers, magazines, banners, billboards, cinema films, radio, T V, the World Wide Web, books, compact discs (CDs), DVDs, videocassettes, computer games, and other forms of publishing. M ASS M EDIA B-9. Mass media is a term used to denote that section of the media specificall y conceived and designed to reach a very large audience, such as the population of a nation-state. The term “public media” has a similar meaning: it is the sum of the public mass distributors of news and entertainment a cross mediums such as newspapers, TV, radio broadcasting, and text publishers. The expansion of Internet me dia has complicated the concept of mass media because now individuals have a means of potential exposure on a scale comparable to what was previously restricted to a select group of mass media producers. Traditional mass media has a correspondingly lessened monopoly on information. These Internet medi a can include personal Web pages, podcasts, and blogs. B-10. During the 20th century, technology that allowed the massive duplicati on of material drove the growth of mass media. Physical duplication technologies, such as printing, re cord pressing, and film duplication, allowed the duplication of books, newspapers, and movies at low pri ces to huge audiences. Radio and TV allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. B-11. Mankind’s ability to use informational power remained slow, small-sca le, and expensive for millennia and then exploded expon entially in speed, scale, afford ability, and accessibility throughout the 20th century. At the beginning of the 21st century, prac tically anyone with the freedom and means to do so can access, develop, and distribute information for any purpose. Mass media can be used for various purposes: Advocacy for business and social concerns, to include advertising, marketing, propaganda, public relations, and political communication. Journalism. Public service announcements. Personal enrichment and education. Entertainment. B-12. Another description of mass media is central media, meaning that it emanates from a central point and provides an identical message to numerous recipien ts. Those who control centralized media are able to control the content and leverage public opinion, as we ll as inherently force certain intrinsic constraints on the kind of messages and information conveyed."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 B-13. Hazards of centralized mass media include the following: A disproportion of power occu rs. Disproportionate informati onal power accrues to those who control centralized mass media; arguably, it is inherently undemocra tic. An inability to transmit tacit knowledge; the context of content presented must either be explicitly explained or is assumed to be understood by the receiver. An inclination to focus on the unusual and sensatio nal to capture the receivers’ attention, leading to a distortion and trivialization of reality. The deliberate promotion of emotions such as anxiety, fear, or greed can be used to se ll a particular agenda. An inability to deal with comp lex issues because of time and economic constraints leads to simplification, further distorting and trivializing reality. B-14. This view of central media can be contrasted w ith lateral media, such as email networks where messages are all slightly different and spread by a pro cess of lateral diffusion. Democratic and independent use of media theoretically serves to educate the public or electorate about issues regarding government and society. Undemocratic use of media can lead to indoctrination, propaganda, an d exploitation. P UBLISHING B-15. Publishing is the industry concerned with the production of literature or i nformation—the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors ma y be their own publishers. Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of pr inted works, such as books and newspapers. With the advent of digital information systems and the Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include Web sites, blogs, and the like. As a business, publis hing includes the development, marketing, production, and distribution of newspapers, magazines, bo oks, literary works, music, and software. B-16. The control of publishing and press freedom is relevant to the effectiveness of i nformational operations. The degree of press freedom is contentious and subjective. C ritics contend that press freedom is constrained by concentration into conglomerates in the West and del iberately and severely censored by the state in undemocratic countries. One source for more information on freedom of the pre ss internationally is “Reporters Without Borders,” which provides assessments and a rank inde x of press freedom of 168 countries ranging from Finland (“most free” in 2006) to North Korea (“least free”). A UDIO R ECORDING AND R EPRODUCTION B-17. Sound recording and reproduction is the electrical or mechanical re-creati on or amplification of sound, often as music. Audio recording involves the use of audio equipment, such as microphones, recording devices, and loudspeakers. From early beginnings with the inventi on of the phonograph using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of elect rical recording, the mass production of the 78 record, the magnetic wire recorder followed by the tape re corder, and the vinyl LP record. The invention of the compact cassette in the 1960s, followed by Sony’s Walkman, gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of digital re cording and the compact disc in 1983 brought massive improv ements in ruggedness and quality. Th e most recent developments have been in digital audio players like the Apple IPOD. B ROADCASTING B-18. Early radio engineers coined the term “broadcas t” in the United States. Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video signals (programs) to a number of recipients (“liste ners” or “viewers”). This group may be the public in general, a relatively la rge audience within the public, or small, narrowly focused audiences. Thus, an Internet channel may distribute text or music worl dwide, while a public address system in a workplace or school may broadc ast very limited ad hoc sound bites to a small population within its range. The sequencing of conten t in a broadcast is called a schedule. TV and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or cable and often thro ugh both simultaneously. By coding signals and having decoding equipment in homes, the latter also enables subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-5 B-19. A broadcasting organization may broadcast severa l programs at the same time through several channels (frequencies); British Broadcasting Corpora tion (BBC) One and Two, for example. On the other hand, two or more organizations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed pa rt of the day. Digital radio and digital TV may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble. When broadcasting via the Internet, the term “webcasting” is often used. In 2004, a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce podcast ing. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. Broadcasting forms a very la rge segment of the mass media. Broadcasting to a very narrow range of audience is called narrowcasting. B-20. Critics have accused the larger conglomerates of dominating media—especially news. Critics say that the larger conglomerates refuse to publicize or deem “newsworth y” information that would be harmful to their other interests and of contributing to the merging of entertai nment and news at the expense of tough coverage of serious issues. Critics also accuse these la rger conglomerates of being a leading force for the standardization of culture (globalization, or so-called “Americanization”). They are also a frequent target of criticism by partisan political groups that often perceive the news productions as biased toward their foes. Broadcasting companies and their supp orters claim that they maintain a strict separation between the business end and the production end of news departments. B-21. Some of the largest media conglomerates include AT&T (U.S.), Berlusconi Group (I taly), Bertelsmann AG (Germany), CanWest Global (Canada), Columbia Broadcasting S ystem (CBS) Corporation (U.S.), General Electric (U.S.), Hearst Co rporation (U.S.), Lagardère Media (France), Liberty Media (U.S.), News Corporation (A ustralia), NHST Mediagroup Norg es Handels Og Sjøfartstidende (Norway), Organizações Globo (Brazil), Grupo Prisa (Spain), Sony (Japan), Time Warner (U.S.), the Times Group (India), Viacom (U.S.), Vivendi (France), and the Walt Disney Company (U.S.) . Just seven of these conglomerates (Disney, CBS, Time Warner, News Corp, Bertelsmann AG, Viacom, and General Electric) together control more than 90 perc ent of the media market in western countries. G EOGRAPHICAL U SAGE OF T ELEVISION B-22. In addition to the explosion of in formational technologies in the 20 th century being relatively recent, the diffusion of such technologies has been uneven. Technological developments typically spread from the developed and democratic world outward with corresponding politi cal effects on access to information and democratization. Authoritarian regimes severely curtail or in fluence some media in their countries. Canadian Networks and Stations B-23. In Canada, there are a number of national networks, including three main networks for Engli sh Canada. One, CBC Television, is owned by the Canadi an Broadcasting Corporation, a government-funded Crown corporation. The other two, CTV and Global, are privately run. The private networks usually use most of their prime-time hours to rebroadcast U.S. shows, while the CBC airs more Canadian programming. Citytv, CH, and A-channel are private systems whose stat ions have a somewhat enhanced local focus. These stations do not reach all of Canada. In French Canada, particularly Quebec, the main networks are the CBC-owned Télévision de Radi o-Canada and private ne tworks TVA and TQS. United States Networks and Stations B-24. In the United States, the three traditional co mmercial TV networks (American Broadcasting Companies [ABC], CBS, and National Broadcasting Company [NBC]) provide prime -time programs for their affiliate stations to air from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Monday through S aturday and from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Sunday. Most stations procure other programming, often syndicated, for o ff prime-time periods. Four newer broadcasting networks, FOX, the CW, ION, and My Network TV do not provide the same amount of network prog ramming as do the traditional three networ ks. Over the past 30 years, cable and satellite TV have come to provide most homes with dozens or e ven hundreds of TV services. Latin American Networks and Stations B-25. More than 500 TV stations exist in Latin America. There are more than 60 million TVs in that same area. This represents a theoretical viewing audience of more than 200 million people. Because of the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 financial and political troubles that occurred betwee n the mid-1970s and the early 1990s, TV networks in some countries of this region had a more irregular development than did those of North Ame rican and European networks. In countries like Mexico or Brazil, one or two networks claim almost all the audience. In other countries, like Colombia, TV broadcasting had historically been state-dominated until the 1990s. In countries like Nicaragua or Peru, TV has had a troubled history. European Networks and Stations B-26. In much of Europe, TV broadcasting has historically been state-dominated rat her than commercially organized, although commercial sta tions have grown in number recentl y. In the UK, the major national broadcaster is the BBC, which is funded by a televisi on license granted by royal charter. Commercial TV is provided by Independent Television (ITV), Channels 4 and 5, as well as the satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting. BBC1, BBC2, ITV, and Channels 4 an d 5 are broadcast on anal og terrestrial TV. An abundance of new broadcasters and channels have changed the market over the la st few years, giving viewers a level of choice previously as sociated only with the United States. B-27. Other leading European networks include SVT, Sweden; RAI, Italy; TF1, M6, and France Télévisions, France; ARD, German y; ORF, Austria; ERT, Greece; YLE, MTV3, and Nelonen, Finland; RTE, Ireland; TVP, Poland; RTP, Po rtugal; TVR, Romania; TVE, Spai n; RTV Slovenija, Slovenia; HRT, Croatia; and BNT, BTV, and Nova Te levizia, Bulgaria. The largest commercial European broadcaster is the Luxembourg-based RTL Group. There are now also a few Europe-w ide networks. Asian Networks and Stations B-28. In Asia, TV has traditionally been state-controlled, although the number of private stations is increasing, as is competition from satellite TV. Japa n’s NHK is a noncommercial network similar to the BBC funded by a TV license fee. NHK has more editorial independence over n ews and current affairs than broadcasters like India’s state-run Doordarshan or China’s China Central T elevision. From 2000 onward, India has encouraged development of new private stations. Star TV based in Ho ng Kong has expanded to other areas recently. The number of private broadcasters is increasing in some count ries. For example, in 2004 Indonesia had 10 private national stations compared to only 1 in 1989. Middle East Networks and Stations B-29. Similarly in the Middle East, TV has been heavily state-controlled, with co nsiderable censorship of both news coverage and entertainment—particularly that imported from the West . The increasing availability of satellite TV has eroded control over this medium, and the number of satellite channels in Arabic is second only to the number of satellite cha nnels in English. The best known satellite channel in Arabic is the Qatar-based news service Al Jazeera. African Networks and Stations B-30. Despite being the most economically advanced country on the continent, South Africa did not introduce TV until 1976 because of opposition from the apartheid regime. N igeria was one of the first countries in Africa to introduce TV in 1959. Zimbab we followed (then Rhodesia) in 1961. Zanzibar was the first area in Africa to introduce color TV in 1973 (although mainland Tanz ania did not introduce TV until 1994). The main satellite TV providers are the South African Mu ltichoice Digital Satellite Television service and the predominantly French language Canal Horizons, which Fran ce’s Canal Plus owns. Australian and New Zealand Networks and Stations B-31. Australian TV began in 1956, just in time for the Melbourne Olympic s. Australia has three nationwide metropolitan commercial networks (Seven, Nine, and Ten), as well as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a government-owned, commercial-free network, and t he Special Broadcasting Service, a commercial-supported, multilingual, govern ment-owned station. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has also issued licenses to community groups to estab lish community TV stations in most capital cities on the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) Channel 31. In regional and rural areas, numerous commercial"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-7 stations are affiliated with one of the three me tropolitan networks and carry programming generally indistinguishable from those in the cities. B-32. The New Zealand government owns two TV networks: Television One and TV2. Othe r, purely commercial networks include TV3 (owned by a Canadian media company), Pri me Television (Australia), Sky Network Television, and a New Zealand government-funded Maori T elevision Service. F ILM B-33. The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost at their invention. The film industry today spans the globe. There is also a large industry for educational a nd instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. The major business c enters of filmmaking are concentrated in India, the United States, China, and Nigeria. However, most developed nations have their own film industries. B-34. Much like American popular music, American cinema has ha d a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. During the 1930s and 1940s, big studios dominated American cinema. These studios virtually monopolized the production and distribution of film. The costs inherent in big-budget studio film production were also a hurdle to being able to pro duce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. Production costs also led to conservative choices in content. Fol lowing technological advances and antitrust legislation, the big studios no longer enjoy such monopoly power. Hollywood, California, remains the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry, but today independ ent filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood and major studio systems. B-35. With the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985 and the arrival of high-resoluti on digital video (DV) in the early 1990s, the technology barrier to movie production has been drastically lowered. Since the introduction of DV technology, filmmakers can concei vably shoot and edit a movie, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. DVDs, professional-grade v ideo connections, nonlinear editing systems, and other new technologies make moviemaking relativ ely inexpensive. However, while the democratization of production has occurred, financing, dist ribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outsid e the traditional system. Most indepe ndent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. B-36. The Indian film industry is multilingual and the larg est in the world in terms of number of annual movie releases and annual (domestic) ticket sales. Indian films have bee n gaining popularity in the rest of the world, especially in countries w ith large numbers of expatriate Indians. India’s film industry is mostl y concentrated in Bombay and is commonly referred to as “Bollywood.” However, there are several smaller centers of Indian film industries in regional languages (Bollywood is largely i n Hindi) centered in the states in which those languages are spoken. B-37. Hong Kong, China, is a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (includi ng the worldwide Chinese diaspora) and East Asia in general. For decades, Hong Kong was t he third-largest motion picture industry in the world (after India and Hollywood) and the second-largest export er. Despite a return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997, Hong Kong film reta ins much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinematic stage. Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong enjoys little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas. It has alway s been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing genres, like comedy a nd action, and relying heavily on formulas, sequels, and remakes. B-38. The cinema of Nigeria is a developing industry that has become increasi ngly productive in recent years. Although Nigeria has been producing films since the 1960s, the rise of di gital cinema has resulted in a rapidly growing video film industry. The Nigerian video feature film indus try is colloquially known as “Nollywood.” Nigeria has a multibillion-dollar movie industry, churn ing out some 200 home videos every month to become the third largest in the world after the United States and India. In just over a decade, Nollywood has grown from nothing into an industry that employs thousa nds of people. B-39. Nollywood has no studios in the Hollywood sense. Filmmakers shoot movie s in locations all over Nigeria. Nigerian directors adopt new technologies as soon as they become affordable. Bulky videotape cameras gave way to their digital descendents. Filmmakers are now replacing t hose with high-definition"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 cameras. Film industry personnel accomplish editing, music, and other postprodu ction work with common computer-based systems. B-40. Currently, Nigerian films outsell Hollywood films in Nigeria and many other Afric an countries. Some 300 producers churn out 1,00 0 and 2,000 new titles per year. Th e films go straight to DVDs and video compact discs. The industry delivers 30 new titles to Nigeria n shops and market stalls every week, where an average film sells 50,000 copies. A hit may sell several hundred thousand. Discs sell for two dollars each, making them affordable for most Nigerians and providing ast ounding returns for the producers. Nigerian video movies are available in even the most remote are as of the continent, and Nollywood films are growing in popularity among th e African communities in both Europe and North America. The content of the Nigerian film industry is primarily commercially orient ed, but includes Christian- and Muslim-themed work as well. I NTERNET B-41. The Internet is “a network of networks.” Speci fically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected computer networks. This network transmits data by packet switching using the standard Internet protocol. It consists of mill ions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and governmental networks, which together carry various information and services , such as email, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked Web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web. Contrary to common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymo us: the Internet is a collection of interconnected computer networks, linked by copper wires, fiber-optic cables , wireless connections, and so on; the Web is a collection of interconnected documents linked by hyperlinks and uniform resource locators (URLs). The World Wide Web is accessible via the Internet. B-42. Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which any individual could have a means of exposure on a s cale comparable to that of mass media. For the first time, anyone with a Web site can address a global audience, although serving t o high levels of Web traffic is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies will drive the cost of bandwidth down. Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (cont ent) is available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliabilit y of information contained in Web pages. In many cases, Web pages are self-published, and practically anyone can create a W eb page. The invention of the Internet has also allowed break ing news stories to reach around th e globe within minutes. This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is likely to change mass media and its relationship to society. B-43. An estimated 16 percent of the world populati on has access to the Intern et with the highest concentration in North America (68.6 percent), Oceania/Australia (52.6 percent ), and Europe (36.1 percent). In terms of broadband access, countries su ch as Iceland (26.7 percent), South Korea (25.4 percent), and the Netherlands (25.3 pe rcent) lead the world. While Internet use is growing worldwide, some governments—such as those of Iran, the People’s Re public of China, and Cuba—restrict what people in their countries can access on the In ternet, especially political and re ligious content. The countries accomplish this restriction through content-control soft ware that filters domains and content. This makes them difficult to access or obtain w ithout elaborate circumve ntion. In Norway, Finl and, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by police. Although this list of forbidden URLs is only supposed to contain addr esses of known child pornography sites, content of the list is secret. Many states have enacted laws making the possess ion or distribution of certain material illegal but do not use filtering software. Most governments and busine sses, among others, use firewalls that restrict access to many sites to protect against cyberterrori sm or cybercrime. S OFTWARE P UBLISHING B-44. Software can be considered a component of the modern international informati on environment because software— Can be made relatively easily and cheaply. Can carry any content.

Moreover, people can easily, discretely, and rapidl y transport powerful software in tiny packages. B-45. A software publisher is a publishing company in the software industry between th e developer and the distributor. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be c ombined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of shareware) . Software publishers often license software from developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region. The terms of licensing vary enormously and are typically s ecret. Developers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets or to avoid focusing on marketing. Conversely, publishers may use developers to create softw are to meet a market need that the publisher has identified. The United States i s the largest and most profitable producer of software in the world by far, and the Microsoft Company dominates the industry. Other countries with large software industries include Japan, England, Canada, and Germany. UNITED STATES DOMESTIC INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT B-46. Individual liberty and freedom of speech protected by law and a tradition of co mpetitive economic freedom in a diverse society provide the United Stat es with an unusually broad array of information content. In the public commons, individuals exchange almost every perspective, counter perspective, and intervening gradation of meaning. As shown in the section above, the United States dominates or leads in many of the forms and technologies of international mass informational power. This section discusses current issues particular to informat ional power as it affects, or may affect, distribution of content to the U.S. domestic audience. B-47. Little mass media regulation existed in the United States before the creation of the Federal Radio Commission in 1927. The Telecommunications Act of 1934 was a fundam ental decision on how broadcast mass media would function from then on. At the time, radio technology was widespre ad among the public, and the electromagnetic spectrum was public propert y. The act reappropriat ed the spectrum to the government and claimed the right to assign spectrum ranges to private part ies as long as they broadcast in the public interest. This act creat ed the Federal Communications Commi ssion (FCC) to replace the Federal Radio Commission. B-48. Lobbyists from the largest radio broadcasters of the time, ABC and NBC, successfully petitioned to attach a cost to broadcast licenses. This enabled them to “price out” many amateur broadcasters. Such was the precedent for much of th e following regulatory deci sions, which have mostly focused on the percentage of a market deemed allowable to a single company. B-49. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 set the modern tone of “deregulati on,” a relaxing of percentage restrictions that solidified the previous history of privatizing the utility and “commodifying” the spectrum. The legislation, touted as a step th at would foster competition, actually resulted in the subsequent mergers of several large companies, a trend that continues. The FCC Forum of February 2003 appro ved new media ownership laws that removed many of the restrictions previously imposed to limit ownership of media within a local area. A few of th e points included the following: Single-company ownership of media in a given market is now permitted up to 45 percen t (formerly 35 percent, up from 25 percent in 1985) of that market. Restrictions on newspaper and TV station ownership in the same market were re moved. All TV channels, magazines, newspapers, cable , and Internet services are now counted and weighted, based on people’s average tendency to find news on that medium. At the sa me time, whether a channel actually contains “news” is no longer considered in counting the percentage of a medium owned by one owner. For example, it is now possible for two companies to own all of a city’s two newspapers, three local TV stations, two national TV networks , and eight local radio stations (up to 45 percent of the media each), as long as there are other companies owning the “Shopping Channel” or the “Discovery Channe l” and at least 10 percent of other non-news outlets. Previous requirements for periodic review of licenses have been changed. Licenses are no longer reviewed for public-interest considerations."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 B-50. Depending on one’s perspective (and political views) such media consolidatio n is capable of dominating the informational power to deliberately craft, manipulate, and disse minate information for conveyance of an intended message or theme to a domestic TA. B-51. In opposition to this trend, some U.S. citizens promote a production and distribution model of “media democracy” that theoretically info rms and empowers all members of society and enhances democratic values. The term also refers to a modern social movement evident in ma ny other countries that attempts to make mainstream media more accountable to the publics they serve and to create democratic alternatives. Citizens base this concept and social movement on th e assertion that increased corporate domination of mass media leads to a perceived shrinking of the mark etplace of ideas. Its propon ents advocate monitoring and reforming the mass media, strengthening public service broadcasting , and developing and participating in alternative media and citizen journalism. B-52. Media democracy is a difficult term to define, because in addition to being a concept, it is also an advocacy movement. A number of academic and grassr oots organizations, each with its own methods and goals, are advancing. Moreover, since suspicion of and hostility to corporate inte rests is a key tenet of the left end of the U.S. domestic political spectrum, much of the media democracy effort runs parallel with anticapitalist, even anti-American, agitation. Ironically, one of the central issues routinely assailed by the right end of the U.S. domestic political spectrum is a perceived monoli thic and consolidated domestic media dominated by a “leftist agen da” in delivery of content. B-53. Despite the difficulties in defining the term, the concept broad ly encompasses the following notions: The health of the democratic political system depends on the efficien t, accurate, and complete transmission of social, political, and cultural information in societ y. The media are the conduits of th is information. As such, they should act in the public interest. The mass media have increasingly been unable and uninterested in fulfilling this role because of increased concentration of ownership and commercial pressures. The concept and practice of democracy are under mined if voters and citizens are unable to knowledgeably participate in public policy debates. B-54. Without an informed and engaged citizenry, policy issues become defined by political and corporate elites. A related element of this concept asserts that co rporate media interests lack a diversity of voices and viewpoints, particularly of traditionally marginalized sectors of the population. The following paragraphs discuss alternatives to traditional mass media. P UBLIC B ROADCASTING B-55. Public broadcasting serves as one potential counte rweight to commercial media. As such, it is a notable element of the so-called media democracy. The government and individual donations usually fund public TV and radio broadcasts. Therefore, they are not subject to the same commercial pressures as private broadcasters and, theoretically, provide a distinct source of more diverse, in-depth media content. However, public broadcasters are subject to funding instability, which jeopardizes their ability to operate consistently. Moreover, public broadcasting’s editorial objectivity is susceptible to the editorial preferences of those who approve and provide grants, which jeopardizes its autonomy. A LTERNATIVE AND C ITIZEN M EDIA B-56. As a response to the asserted shortcomings of the mainstream media, proponents of media democracy often advocate supporting and engaging in independent and alternative pr int and electronic media. Through citizen journalism and citizen media, individuals can produce and disseminate information and opinions that the mainstream media marginali zes. Practically anyone can now easily and cheaply publish audio, video, and written content to the Web. Home computing has empowered e veryone to be a publisher of written documents. Every shade of opini on is now represented and there is a published viewpoint for every microconstituency. However, objec tivity and credibility are endlessly disputed. In the absence of consensus over objectivity and credibility, such alternative media is unlikely to replace the mass persuasive power of the traditional, large- scale, information-providing institutions."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-11 W IKIPEDIA AND W IKINEWS AS T OOLS OF M EDIA D EMOCRACY B-57. A similar claim for media democracy is asserted for the online dictionary “Wikipedia.” Anyone— regardless of educational background, experience, or in-depth knowledge—can edit, expand, or remove content. Individuals do not have to get the approval of an editorial boa rd to post content. Although there are administrators on Wikipedia, they have roughly the same powers as ordinary users. Wikipedia also lacks corporate control: it operates as a not -for-profit entity and accep ts no advertising or corporate investment, which can influence or theoretically silence particular ideas. Typically, small individual donations pay its operating costs. Creators of a related site called “Wikinews” intend to provide an alternative news source using the same open collaborative philosophy. B-58. As with other forms of alternative media, such as weblogs, the appeal of Wikipedia is that anyone can access and contribute to the site. This site provides a wide range of information in a free format and can be a handy quick reference similar to a traditional en cyclopedia. However, its accessibility diminishes its authority. Although individuals can dispute inserted content, the shaping of mu ch content has no objective peer review. This allows individuals to easily craf t content to convey a slanted editorial position. ROLE OF UNITED STATES DOMESTIC MEDIA B-59. U.S. domestic media includes stationary visuals, such as billboards and other a dvertisements, and print documents, such as newspapers, periodicals, and books. Publishers typica lly craft these products for and disseminate them to specific, narrowly defined TAs to address specific, narrowly defined interests (predominantly commercial advertising and entertainm ent). In keeping with this manual’s focus on mass media, however, this section w ill outline U.S. broadcast media—specifically, news media, whi ch is theoretically a transmission of objective truth imparting seriou s information about society and matters of state. B-60. Regular but rudimentary broadcast programming occurred in the United States and several European countries before WWII. Regular network broadcasting began in the United Stat es in 1946, and TV became common in American homes by the middle of the 1950s. In the last half of th e 20th century, TV news in the United States evolved from a simple 10-to-15-minut e format in the evenings to a variety of programs and channels. Today, viewers can receive local, regional, and national news programming in many different ways, any time of the day. O RIGIN AND D EVELOPMENT OF T ELEVISION N EWS B-61. The reach, appeal, and centrality of TV news is ta ken so much for granted in the early 21st century that it is difficult to remember how recently it developed and ho w limited it was, and how few media stars have represented its visual front. NBC and CBS only initiated regular network ne ws broadcasts in 1948. The third major network broadcast news (ABC) did no t join NBC and CBS until 1965. For decades, these three national broadcasters of TV news were the public’s only choice. Moreover, in th e 1960s and 1970s national news was only available at set times of the evening (after the concl usion of a standard workday), requiring the news-viewing public to arrange their personal schedules around the limited availability of broadcast national news. B-62. Moreover, many news anchor personalities remained in their position s so long that they took on a familiar and authoritative iconic status. For example, Walter Cronkite (CBS news anchor 1963 to 1981) was alternately known as “Uncle Walter,” or “the most trusted man in America.” Critics have claimed that Cronkite’s opinion after the Vietnamese Tet Offensive that “the war w as now lost” significantly influenced American public opinion against continued involvement in the war. Since the 1940s, fewer than two dozen personalities have been the influe ntial public face of such mainstr eam broadcast news by the three traditional networks. T ODAY ’ S T ELEVISION N EWS B-63. TV news has come a long way since its beginning. Today, electronic news gathering has enabled reporters to capture video and audio more easily and edit the footage faster th an in the days of film."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Journalists also employ microwave and satellite feeds and even videophone to transmit live video and audio signals from remote locations. B-64. Programmable video recorders, such as videocassette recorders and the di gital video recorder free viewers from dependence on artificial schedules. Consumers can now watch programs on their own schedule once they are broadcast and recorded. TV service providers also offer video on demand, a set of programs that viewers can watch at any time. Mobile phone networks and the Internet are capable of carrying video streams. In addition, Internet TV (either live or as downloadable programs) and video-sharing Web sites have become more popular. P ROGRAMMING B-65. Aside from TV news production, news providers must market and deliver the “product” to whatever markets are willing to use it. TV is a commercial business. Sell ing the product and generating revenues from advertising drive programming decisions more than any other factor. Despite t he inherent substantive importance of “news information,” news broadcasts are a small segment of the total TV menu. News broadcasts must compete with other first-run and s yndicated TV entertainment, the Internet, traditional newspapers, and so on, which has affected the availability and format—and some would argue quality—of TV news. TV news programming in the United States is separated into t hree different categories: local news, network news, and cable news. Local News B-66. Many local broadcast TV stations have in-house news departments that produce their own newscasts. Newscasters gear content toward view ers in specific, designated market areas in which the stations operate. The content of such stories have a strong local focus and are relevan t to local lives. Network News B-67. The three traditional networks all operate news divisions named ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News respectively. Their schedules are broadly sim ilar. They each air half-hour early weekday morning programs, and, following intervening local news, they each run a longer morning news show with a significant entertainment approach. All three also have morning weekend news pr ograms. On Sunday mornings, the three networks and FOX News Channel ai r political interview programs. In the evenings, the networks’ flagship news programs air seven nigh ts a week. During prime time, all three traditional networks air newsmagazine programs with a more in-depth and themat ic focus on select topics. On late weeknights, the networks air similar half-hour newsmagazine program s. Cable News B-68. The advent of cable TV in the United States led to the eventual birth of cabl e news. The first 24-hour cable news operation, Cable News Network (CNN), was launched in 1980 and gain ed a significant reputation with its 1991 coverage of the Gulf War. The success of CNN inspired many other 24-hour cable news stations. Today, CNN, CNN Headline News, FOX News Channel, MSNBC, and CNBC compete for viewers in the national cable news arena. Regional cable news operations, such as New England Cable News, NY1 for New York City, Northwest Cable Ne ws, and Texas Cable News, have also gained prominence among regional viewers. The programming styles vary among these cable channels, but during prime time, their key personalities strongly drive th e channels. Typically, such programming is in a TV show format based on a particular host rather than continuous broadcasts of breaking news. C URRENT D EVELOPMENTS B-69. As the Internet has become more prevalent in Amer ican lives, TV news operations have had to adapt and embrace new technologies. Today, most TV news operations publish the text and video of the stories aired during their newscasts on dedicated Web sites. Such information pos ting is contributing to a convergence between TV and Internet media formats accessible 24 hour s a day to computer-savvy viewers."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-13 B-70. Technological advancement is also changing the way news is gathered and edited. R eporters do not use film anymore. TV journalists are now capturing and reporting images and so und on video, DV, and even high-definition. Even editing and archiving systems are evolving as more sta tions convert to nonlinear editing systems and store file footage on computer servers rather than tape s. B-71. With digital cable comes on-demand news programming. News operations have begun to feel the burden to generate news content on a 24-hour news cycle, while keeping mat erial “fresh” on their regularly scheduled newscasts. Such around-the-clock coverage means that rather tha n having a certain deadline for scheduled newscasts to meet, reporters have to file stories as fast as the y can. Producers, on the other hand, have to find more innovative ways to package news stories as fresh to the vi ewers. Such immediate, worldwide coverage of news events has speeded th e pace of cause-and-effect and reaction times in international statecraft. F ORMATS B-72. Over the years, TV news in the United States has evolved into a variety of formats. Local news and network news, once similar in having slow paces and low story count s, are now quite different in style: Traditional . In the early days of TV, the public viewed local newscasts as a public service. The style was straightforward. Stations and networks divided newscasts into th ree blocks: news, sports, and weather. They further divided the news block into national, internatio nal, and local stories. These newscasts usually had a white male anchor, with w hite males announcing sports and weather as well. This form at is no longer prevalent. Eyewitness news . This style developed in the late 1960s. Networks and stations hired reporters to leave the newsroom and become “eyewitnesses” of news stories, recording t hem on film. Later, they asked reporters to join the anchors in the studio to talk about the st ories. Most TV news operations are working under some variation of the eyewitness format. Action news . TV executives devised this style to co mpete against the eyewitness news format. The action news format features short stories, high story counts in newscasts , and a strong focus on spot news. The “action” refers to the fast pacing of the newscast. Franchise news . This style is a variation of eyewitness news. Some stations decide to brand the ir news with slogans such as “News You Can Use” or “8 On Your Side.” The newscasts at these stations tend to focus more on franchises—stories that cover a topic important to l ocal viewers. The most successful franchises are health and consumer news, but other examples inc lude parenting, pets, environment, and crime fighting. Almost every news op eration uses some franchises, and a few stations build their news identities around these topical stories entirely. Interview news shows . Many cable news channels run these shows, which incorporate lots of talk and often heated debates between anchors and guests. Interview news program s typically promote discernable editorial positions on the topics covered. Tabloid news . This style blurs the line between news and entertainment wit h sensational writing and energetic reporters. Tabloid news programs generally confine stories to popular culture items. A LLEGED S OCIAL D ANGERS B-73. Paralleling TV’s entrenched informational primacy in current U.S. family life and society, a vocal chorus of legislators, scientists, parents, and politi cal commentators raise objections to an uncritical acceptance of the medium. Continuous disputes over the effect TV view ing may have on children, whether it influences individuals to misbehave and leads to erosion of social more s or health, and how aired content is controlled to further particular (political) agendas are now commo n complaints. Judgments on such issues are beyond the scope of this manual. However, given the assumed fundamental mission of U.S. domestic news to deliver truth—and the example of Cronkite declaring the Vie tnam War “unwinnable after Tet” (referenced above), and the effect that declarati on may have had on public opinion—it is reasonable to assume that news programs do exert influence on domestic support for U .S. foreign policy. B-74. The extent of such media influence and the forces and agendas behind it are s ubjects of continuous debate. A neutral understanding of the term “mains tream media” (MSM) suggests outlets that are in"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-14 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 harmony with the prevailing direction of influence in the culture at large. In the United States, usage of this term often depends on the connotations the speaker wants to invoke. The term “corpora te media” is often used by left-wing media critics to imply that MSM is made up of large multinational corporations, which primarily promote corporate, capitalist interests. By contrast, right-wing media critics’ use of the term MSM often connotes a majority of mass media sources dominated by politically left-leaning elites that are furthering a leftist political agenda. INSTRUMENTS OF UNITED STAT ES INFORMATIONAL POWER B-75. U.S. engagement in the world and the DOS’s engagement of the American public are indispensable to the conduct of foreign policy. Where conflict between states is absent or low, the United States attempts to influence other states’ populations through PD. B-76. The Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs has oversight o f the PD functions of cultural and educational exchange, as well as international inform ation programs, and the PA function of providing information to the U.S. audience. The long-term and comprehensi ve strategy of the bureau is based on three strategic objectives: Offer people throughout the world a positive vision of hope and opportunit y that is rooted in America’s belief in freedom, justice, opportunity, and respect for all. Isolate and marginalize violent Muslim extremists; confront the ir ideology of tyranny and hate. Undermine their efforts to portray the West as in conflict with Islam by empowering mainstream voices and demonstrating respect for Muslim cultures and contributions. Foster a sense of common interests and common values between Americans and people of different countries, cultures, and faiths throughout the world. P UBLIC D IPLOMACY AND T RADITIONAL D IPLOMACY B-77. In traditional diplomacy, U.S. Embassy officials con duct official USG business with the officials of the host government. The emphasis is on state-to-state relations t hrough their respective government apparatus. In PD, U.S. Embassy officials primarily engage a wide range o f nongovernment audiences. The U.S. Country Team sometimes conducts these activitie s directly but often acts a facilitator of private American and individual engagements with various sectors of the HN socie ty. B-78. The Undersecretary for Public Di plomacy and Public Affairs over sees the following offices and bureaus: The Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources for Public Diplomacy a nd Public Affairs. The Bureau of Public Affairs. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). The Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP). Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs B-79. This office provides long-term strategic planning and performance me asurement capability for PD and PA programs. It enable s the Undersecretary to better advise on the allocation of PD and PA resour ces, to focus those resources on the most urgent national security object ives, and to provide realistic measurement of PD’s and PA’s effectiveness. The offi ce also coordinates the department’s PD presence in the interagency, in close consultation with relevant bureaus. Bureau of Public Affairs B-80. The Bureau of Public Affairs carries out the S ecretary of State’s mandate to help Americans understand the importance of foreign affairs, and to feed their concerns and comment s back to policy makers.

It works in close cooperation with State Department posts through cultu ral and professional exchanges and presenting U.S. history, society, art, and culture in all of its diversity to overseas audiences. Bureau of International Information Programs B-82. The IIP is the principal international strategic communications entity for the foreign affairs community. The IIP informs, engages, and influences international audiences abou t U.S. policy and society to advance American intere sts. The IIP develops and implements PD strategies that measurably influence international audiences through quality programs and cutting-edge technologies. The IIP provides localized context for U.S. policies and messages, reaching millions worldwide in E nglish, Arabic, Chinese, French, Persian, Russian, and Spanish. B-83. The IIP’s mission statement is to “inform, engage, and influence internati onal audiences about U.S. policy and society to advance America’s interests. ” The IIP delivers America’s message to the world through a number of key products and services. The IIP created this outreach strictly for international audiences, such as international media, government offi cials, opinion leaders, and the public in more than 140 countries around the world. The IIP— Delivers America’s message to the world, counter acting negative preconceptions, maintaining an open dialogue, and building bridges of understanding to help build a network of c ommunication, promote American voices, and forge lasting relationships in inte rnational communities. Delivers clear and meaningful U.

I NTERNATIONAL B ROADCASTING B UREAU B-84. The USG created the IBB as a federal agency in 1994 to produce political radio and TV broadcasts that intended for audiences in foreign countries. The IBB replaces the defunct Bureau of Broadcasting agency that superseded the Voice of America. The le gislation that originally placed the IBB within the United States Information Agency (USIA) also created a Broadcastin g Board of Governors (BBG) with oversight authority over all nonmilitary USG international broadcasting. Whe n the government disbanded USIA in 1999, it established the IBB and BBG as in dependent federal government entities. The IBB and"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-16 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 BBG do not fall under the oversight of the Undersecretary for Public Dipl omacy and Public Affairs. The IBB includes— The Voice of America (VOA). Radio Martí and TV Martí (broad casting exclusively to Cuba). An office of engineering and technical services. B-85. The BBG funds other international broadcasting services as privat e corporations that are not part of the IBB. These include Radio Sawa (Arab world), Radio Farda (Persian Farsi to Iran), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia. The IBB provides the technical suppo rt of transmission sites in three U.S. states and operates shortwave and medium wave relay stations in Europe, Africa, and Asia. B-86. The BBG is made up of nine bipartisan members with expertise in the fields of journalism, broadcasting, and public and international affairs. The President appoints eigh t members and the U.S. Senate confirms them. The ninth, an ex-officio memb er, is the Secretary of St ate. The BBG oversees all USG and government-sponsored, nonmilitary internatio nal broadcasting. The BBG board also evaluates the mission and operation of U.S. international broadcasters to ensure statutory compliance, to assess quality and effectiveness, to determine the addition and deletio n of language services, and to submit annual reports to the President and Congress. INFORMATION OPERATIONS B-87. When some percentage of another state is hostile to U.S. interest s to the point that it becomes a defense concern, the United States may engage in IO (PSYOP, EW, physical stri ke, and so on) against that adversarial percentage. M ILITARY O PERATIONS AND THE I NFORMATION E NVIRONMENT B-88. Information is a strategic resource vital to national security. Dominan ce of the information environment is a reality that extends to the armed forces of the United States at all levels. Military operations, in particular, are dependent upon many simultaneous and integrated activities that, in turn, depend upon information and information systems, which the United State s must protect. B-89. In modern military operations, commanders face a variety of information challenges. Technical challenges include establishing and maintaining conn ectivity, particularly in austere and distributed locations. Operational challenges include the complex ities of modern combat against adversaries with growing information capabilities. For example, regardless of size, adversaries, including terrorist groups, can counter U.S. efforts through propaganda campaigns or develop, purchas e, or download from the Internet tools and techniques enabli ng them to attack U.S. information and information systems, which may result in tangible impacts on U.S. diplomatic, econo mic, or military efforts. The global information environment and its associated technologies are poten tially available to everyone, and as a result, U.S. military commanders face another challenge. Advers aries now have the capability to pass information, coordinate, exchange ideas, and synchr onize their actions instantaneously. B-90. The commander visualizes, plans, and directs operations—IO are a part of those op erations. The commander’s intent should specify a visualization of the desired effects of IO a nd other operations for the staff to develop IO objectives. The commander must not only be able to vis ualize the desired effects of IO but also to understand the adversary’s capabilities to lim it the impact of U.S. operations while the adversary strives to acquire information superiority from the United States. These effec ts can vary based on the objectives of the mission, ranging from disrupting an enemy commander in comb at to assuring friendly nations through combin ed or multinational military training or ex ercises during peacetime. The nature of the conflict determines the role of the military and the desired end stat e or effect. If conducting a humanitarian assistance mission, then generating goodwill for th e services rendered and departing with a favorable impression of U.S. activities becomes a prim ary objective. The commander’s intent must include the concept of how these effects will help achieve force objectives. B-91. Military forces operate in an information enviro nment of constantly changing content and tempo. This evolution adds another layer of complexity to the challenge of planning and e xecuting military operations at a specific time and in a specific location. A continuum of long-, medi um-, and short-term"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-17 factors, each of which must be considered together when planning and ex ecuting military operations, shapes the information environment. Commanders and IO cell chiefs must be pr epared to adapt or modify IO plans to meet their desired IO effects. Long-term factors that ma y shape the information environment include the various ways by which humans— Organize (nation-states, tribes, families). Govern. Interact as groups (culture, sociology, religion). Experience regional influence (stability, alliances, economic relation ships). Advance technologically. Medium-term factors may include— The rise and fall of leaders. The competition between groups over resources or goals. The incorporation of specific technologi es into information infrastructure. The employment of resources by organizations to take advantage of IT and infrastructure. Short-term factors may include— The weather. The availability of finite resources to support or employ specific in formation technology (IT). The ability to extend or maintain sensors and portable information i nfrastructure to the specific location of distant military operations. B-92. The pervasiveness of the information environment in human activity combined with the speed and processing power of modern IT enhance and complicate military efforts to organize, tra in, equip, plan, and operate. Today, technology has opened the way to an ever-increasing span of control. B-93. U.S. forces perform their missions in an increas ingly complex information environment. To succeed, it is necessary for U.S. forces to gain and maintain information superiorit y. DOD policy describes information superiority as the operational advantage gained by the a bility to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information wh ile exploiting or denying an adversary’s ability to do the same. The forces possessing better information and using that i nformation to more effectively gain understanding have a major advantage over their adversaries. A commander who gai ns this advantage can use it to accomplish missions by affecting perceptions, attitu des, decisions, and actions. However, information superiority is not static; during operations, all sides c ontinually attempt to secure their own advantages and deny useful information to adversaries. The operational advantages of inform ation superiority can take several forms, ranging from the ability to create a comm on operational picture to the ability to delay an adversary’s decision to commit reinforcements. B-94. Recognizing information superiority can be difficult to attain over cert ain adversaries, but its advantages are significant. When it exists, the info rmation available to commanders allows them to accurately visualize the situation, anticipate events, and make appr opriate, timely decisions more effectively than adversary decision makers. B-95. In essence, information superiority enhances commanders’ freedom of action and all ows them to execute decisions and maintain the initiative while remain ing inside the adversary’s decision cycle. However, commanders recognize that without continuous IO designed to achieve and maintain information superiority, adversaries may counter those advantages and possibly attain infor mation superiority themselves. Commanders can achieve information superiority by mai ntaining accurate situational understanding while controlling or affecting the adve rsaries’ or TAs’ percep tions. The more a commander can shape this disparity, the gr eater the friendly advantage. B-96. Potential information adversaries come in many shapes. However, they traditionally are hostile countries who wish to gain information on U.S. military capabilities and intentions, malicious hackers who wish to steal from or harm the USG, terrorists, and economic competitors, ju st to name a few. Potential adversarial information attack techniques are nume rous. Some, particularly electronic means, can be prevented by the consistent application of encryption, firewalls, and other netw ork security techniques. Others are considerably more difficult to counter. Possible threat information te chniques include but are not"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-18 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 limited to deception, electronic attack (EA), computer network attack (CNA), propaganda and PS YOP, and signals intelligence (SIGINT) operations. B-97. With the free flow of information present in all th eaters, such as TV, phone, and Internet, conflicting messages can quickly emerge to defeat the intended ef fects. As a result, continuous synchronization and coordination between IO, PA, PD, and U.S. allies is impe rative. It also helps to ensure that information themes employed during operations involving neut ral or friendly populations remain consistent. B-98. IO may involve complex legal and policy issues and require careful review. Beyo nd strict compliance with legalities, U.S. military activities in the inform ation environment, as in the physical domains, are conducted as a matter of policy and societ al values on a basis of respect for fundamental human rights. U.S. forces, whether operating physically from bases or locations overse as or from within the boundaries of the United States or elsewhere, are required by law and policy to act in accordance with (IAW) U.S. law and the law of armed conflict. P RINCIPLES OF I NFORMATION O PERATIONS B-99. Success in military operations depends on collecting and integrating e ssential information while denying it to the adversary and other TAs. IO encompass planning, coordinating, and s ynchronizing the employment of current capabilities to deliberately affect or defe nd the information environment to achieve the commander’s objectives. IO are integrated into join t operations as follows: Core capabilities (EW, computer network oper ations [CNO], PSYOP, MILDEC, and OPSEC) are integrated into the planning and execution of operations in the information environment. Supporting IO capabilities (IA, physical security, physical attack, CI, an d combat camera [COMCAM]) have military purposes other than IO , but they either operate in or affect the information environment. Related IO capabilities (PA, CMO, and DSPD) may be constrained by U.S. polic y or legal considerations. Although these capabilities have common interfaces with IO, their purposes and rules make them separate and distinct. As a result, it is essential that commanders and their staffs coordinate their efforts when ex ercising their functions within the information environment. B-100. IO are primarily concerned with affecting decisions and decision-making processes, while defending friendly decision-making processes. Primary mechanisms used to affe ct the information environment include influence, disruption, corruption, or usurpation. Table B- 1, page B-19, describes how joint operations integrate IO. B-101. The ability of IO to affect and defend decision ma king is based on five fundamental assumptions. Although each of these assumptions is an important enabling factor for IO , they will not all necessarily be true for every operation. For any sp ecific operation where one or more of these assumptio ns are not met, the risk assessment provided to the commander woul d be adjusted accordingly . The five fundamental assumptions are as follows: It is generally accepted that the quality of inform ation that is considered valuable to human and automated decision makers is universal. However, the relativ e importance of each quality criterion of information may vary based on the influences of geography, language, culture , religion, organization, experience, or personality. It is known that decisions are made base d on the information available at the time. It is possible, with finite resources, to understand the relevant aspec ts of the information environment to include the processes deci sion makers use to make decisions. It is possible to affect the information envir onment in which specific decision makers act through psychological, electr onic, or physical means. It is possible to measure the eff ectiveness of IO actions in relation to an operational objective. B-102. Since human activity takes place in the information environment, it is potentially subject to IO. However, IO should only target mission-related critical psychological , electronic, and physical points in the information environment. B-103. IO capabilities can produce effects and achieve objec tives at all levels of war and across the range of military operations. The nature of the modern information environment complicates the identification of"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-19 the boundaries between these levels. Therefore, at all levels, informa tion activities (including IO) must be consistent with broader national security policy and strategic objectives. Sometimes only a small TA is an adversary within an otherwise nonadversarial state. At the other end of the spec trum of conflict, when conflict between states is elevated to potential or actual employment of armed forces, the entire population of an adversarial state may be the TA of IO. Table B-1. Information operations integration into joint operations B-104. IO are conducted across the range of military oper ations. IO can make significant contributions before major operations begin. Because of these factors, the IO environment should be prepared and assessed through a variety of engagement and intelligence activi ties. In addition to affecting the environment before the onset of military operations, IO are essential to postc ombat operations. Therefore, integration, planning, employment, and assessment of core, supporting, and related IO are vital to ensuring a rapid transition to a peaceful environment.

The ultimate strategic objective of IO is to deter a potential or act ual adversary or other TA from taking actions that threaten U.S. national interests. In addition, IO actions executed through civilian-controlled portions of the global information envi ronment must account for U.S. policy and legal issues, as well as potentially disruptive infrastructure issues, t hrough civil-military coordination at all levels. IO actions that may cause unintended reactio ns from U.S. or foreign populaces also require civil-military coordination. B-106. IO may target human decision making or automated decision support systems with s pecific actions. Technology allows for increasingly precise targeting of autom ated decision making and affords more sophisticated ways to protect it. However, targe ting automated decision making is only effective if the adversary is relying on it. B-107. The focus of IO is on the deci sion maker and the information environment to affect decision making and thinking processes, knowledge, and understanding of the situati on. IO can affect data, information, and knowledge in three basic ways: By taking specific psychological, electronic, or physical actions that add, modify, or remove information from the environment of various individuals or groups of decision makers. By taking actions to affect the infrastructure th at collects, communicates, processes, and stores information in support of targeted decision makers. By influencing the way people receive, process, interpret, and use da ta, information, and knowledge. B-108. Commanders use IO capabilities in both offensive and defensive o perations simultaneously to accomplish the mission, increase their force effectiveness, and protect their organizations and systems. Fully integrating IO capabilities requires planners to treat IO as a single function. Commanders can use IO capabilities to accomplis h the following: Destroy. Destruction is damaging a system or entity so badly that it cannot pe rform any function without being replaced or entirely rebuilt. Disrupt. Disruption is breaking or interrupting the flow of information. Degrade. Degradation is reducing the effectiven ess or efficiency of adversary C2 or communications systems and information collection efforts or means. IO can also degrade the morale of a unit, the target’s value, or the quality of adversary decisions and actions. Deny. Denial is preventing the adversary from accessi ng and using critical in formation, systems, and services. Deceive. Deception is causing a person to believe what is not true. MILDEC seeks to misl ead adversary decision makers by manipulating their perception of reality. Exploit. Exploitation is gaining access to adversary C2 systems to collect information or to plant false or misleading information. Influence. Influence is causing others to behave in a manner favorable to U.S. forces. Protect. Protection is taking action to guard against espionage or capture of sensitive equipment and information. Detect. Detection is discovering or discerning the existence, presence, or fact of an intrus ion into information systems. Restore. Restoration is bringing information and inform ation systems back to their original state. Respond. Response is reacting quickly to an adversary’s or others’ IO attack or int rusion. B-109. SC constitutes focused USG efforts to understand and engage key audiences to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of USG interest s, policies, and objectives through coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchron ized with the actions of all elements of national power. DOD efforts must be part of a governmentwide approach to develo p and implement a more robust SC capability. The DOD mu st also support and participate in USG SC activities to understand, inform, and influence relevant foreign audiences, including the DOD’s trans ition to and from hostilities, security, military forward presence, and stability operations. PA, DSPD, and IO capabilities primarily accomplish DOD transition and coordination."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-21 B-110. DOD PA, DSPD, and IO are distinct functions that can support SC. The synch ronization of these functions is essential for SC to be effective. CCD Rs should ensure IO, PA, and DSPD planning is consistent with overall USG SC objectives. CCDRs also must ensure that the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) approves the planning. CCDRs should in tegrate an information strategy into planning for peacetime and contingency situations. CCDRs plan, ex ecute, and assess PA, DSPD, and IO activities to implement theater security coopera tion plans, to support U.S. Embassies’ information programs, and to support other agencies’ PD and PA programs that directly support DOD miss ions. B-111. IO enables the accuracy and timelin ess of information required by U.S. military commanders by defending U.S. systems from exploitation by adversaries. IO are used to deny adversaries acce ss to their C2 information and other supporting automated infrastructures. Adversari es are increasingly exploring and testing IO actions as an asymmetric threat that can be used to thwart U.S. mil itary objectives that are heavily reliant on information systems. This threat requires the U.S. military to employ defensive technologies and utilize leading-edge tactics and pr ocedures to protect U.S. forces and systems from attacks. C ORE , S UPPORTING , AND R ELATED I NFORMATION O PERATIONS C APABILITIES B-112. Of the five core IO capabilities, PSYOP, OPSEC, and MILDEC have played a major part in military operations for many centuries. In this modern age, they have been j oined first by EW and most recently by CNO. Together these five capabilities, used in co njunction with supporting and related capabilities, provide the JFC with the principal means of in fluencing an adversary and other TAs by enabling the joint forces freedom of operation in the information environ ment. Psychological Operations B-113. PSYOP are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultim ately, the behavior of their governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. The purpose of PSYOP is t o induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behaviors favorable to the originator’s objectives. PS YOP are a vital part of the broad range of U.S. activities to influence foreign audiences and are the only DOD op erations authorized to influence foreign TAs directly through radio, print, and other media. PSYOP personnel a dvise the supported commander on methods to capitalize on th e psychological impacts of every aspect of force employment and on how to develop a strategy for de veloping and planning the dissemination of specific PSYOP programs to achieve the overall campaign objectives. B-114. During a crisis, a Psychological Operations asse ssment team (POAT) deploys at the request of the supported commander. A POAT is a small, tailored team of PSYOP planners, produc t distribution and dissemination specialists, and logistics specialists. Th e POAT assesses the situ ation, develops PSYOP objectives, and recommends the appropriate level of support to accomplish the mission. A POAT can augment a unified command or JTF staff and provide PSYOP planning support. The senior PSYOP officer in the operational area, normally the joint psychological operations task force co mmander, may also serve as the de facto joint force PSYOP officer. Working through the various component o perations staffs, the joint force PSYOP officer ensures continuity of psychol ogical objectives and identif ies themes to stress and avoid. B-115. PSYOP have a central role in the achievement of UW objectives in support of the JFC. In today’s information environment, even PSYOP conducted at the tactical leve l can have strategic effects. Therefore, PSYOP have an approval process that Soldiers must understand. The necessity for timely decisions is fundamental to effective PSYOP and IO. Anticipatin g PSYOP involvement in th e early stages of an operation is particularly important given the time it takes to develop, design, pr oduce, distribute, disseminate, and evaluate PSYOP products and actions. Interagency-coordinated a nd OSD-approved PSYOP programs oversee the conduct of all PSYOP. Th e PSYOP program approval process at the national level requires time for sufficient coordination and re solution of issues; hence, JFCs should begin PSYOP planning as early as possible to ensure the execution of PSYOP in support of operat ions. A JFC must have an approved PSYOP program, execution authority, and delegation of product approval authority before PSYOP execution can begin. JFCs should request PSYOP planners imme diately during the initial crisis stages to ensure the JFC has plenty of time to obta in the proper authority to execute PSYOP. PSYOP assets"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-22 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 may be of particular value to the JFC in precombat and postcombat operati ons when other means of influence are restrained or not authorized. Military Deception B-116. MILDEC are deliberately mi sleading actions executed for adversar y decision makers as to friendly military capabilities, intentions, and operations, thereb y causing the adversary to take specific actions (or inactions) that contribute to the accomplishment of the friendly forces’ m ission. MILDEC and OPSEC are complementary activities—MILDEC seeks to encourage in correct analysis, causing the adversary to arrive at specific false deductions, while OPSEC seeks to deny real information to an adversary and prevent correct deduction of friendly plans. To be effective, a MILDEC operati on must be susceptible to adversary collection systems and “seen” as credible to the enemy commander and staff. A plausible approach to MILDEC planning is to employ a friendly COA that friendly forces can execute and that adversary intelligence can verify. However, MILDEC planners must not fall into the trap of ascribing to the adversary particular attitudes, values, and reactions that “mirro r image” likely friendly action in the same situation; for example, assuming that the adversary will respond or act in a particular manner based on how U.S. forces would respond. B-117. Core, supporting, and related IO capabilities al ways represent competing priorities for the resources required for deception and the resources requ ired for the real operation. For this reason, the deception plan should be developed concurrently with the real plan , starting with the commander’s and staff’s initial estimate, to ensure proper resourcing of both. To encourage incorrect analysis by the adversary, it is usually more efficient and effective to provide a false purpose for r eal activity than to create false activity. OPSEC of the deception plan is at leas t as important as OPSEC of the real plan, since compromise of the deception may expose the real plan . This requirement for cl ose-hold planning while ensuring detailed coordination is the greatest challe nge to MILDEC planners. On joint staffs, MILDEC planning and oversight responsibility is normally organized as a sta ff deception element in the operations directorate of a joint staff (J-3). B-118. MILDEC is fundamental to succe ssful UW. It exploits the adve rsary’s information systems, processes, and capabilities. Successf ul MILDEC rely on an understanding of how the adversary commander and his staff think and plan and how both use information managem ent to support their efforts. Effective MILDEC requires a high degree of coordinatio n with all elements of friendly forces’ activities in the information environment, as well as with physical activities. Ea ch of the core, supporting, and related capabilities has a part to play in the development of successful M ILDEC and in maintaining its credibility over time. While PA should not be involved in the provision of false information, i t must be aware of the intent and purpose of MILDEC in order not to inadvertently compromise i t. Operations Security B-119. OPSEC is a process of identifying critical information and subsequentl y analyzing friendly actions and other activities to— Identify what friendly information is necessary for the adversary to have sufficiently accurate knowledge of friendly forces and intentions. Deny adversary decision makers critical information about friendly force s and intentions. Cause adversary decision makers to misjud ge the relevance of known critical friendly information because other information about friendly forces and intentions rem ains secure. B-120. On joint staffs, the J-3 is normally responsibl e for OPSEC. A designated OPSEC program manager supervises other members of the command-assigned OPSEC team and oversees t he coordination, development, and implementation of OPSEC as an integrated part of IO in th e operational area. B-121. OPSEC denies the adversary the information needed to correctly asses s friendly capabilities and intentions. In particular, OPSEC complements MILDEC by denying an adversary information required to both assess a real plan and to di sprove a deception plan . For those IO capabilities that exploit new opportunities and vulnerabilities, such as EW and CN O, OPSEC is essential to ensure uncompromised friendly capabilities."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-23 B-122. The process of identifying essential elements of friendly information and taking me asures to mask them from disclosure to adversaries is only one part of a defense-in-depth app roach to securing friendly information. To be effective, other types of security must complement OPSE C. Examples of other types of security include physical security, IA programs, computer network defense (CN D), and personnel programs that screen personnel and limit authorized access. Electronic Warfare B-123. EW plays a limited role in UW. EW refers to any military action involv ing the use of electromagnetic (EM) and directed energy to control the EM spectrum or to attack the adversary. EW includes three major subdivisions: EA, electronic protection (EP), and electr onic warfare support (ES). EA involves the use of EM energy, dir ected energy, or antiradia tion weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying adversary combat capability. EP ensures the friendly use of the EM spectrum. ES consists of actions tasked by or under direc t control of an operational commander to search for, intercept, identif y, and locate or localize sources of intentional and unintentional radiated EM energy for the purpose of i mmediate threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations. ES provides information required for decisions inv olving EW operations and other tactical actions, such as threat avoidance, targeting, and homing. F orces can use ES data to produce SIGINT, provide targeting for electronic or other forms of attack, and pr oduce measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). SIGINT and MASINT can also provide battle damage assessment (BDA) and feedback on the effectiveness of the overall operational plan. B-124. EW contributes to the success of IO by using offe nsive and defensive tactics and techniques in a variety of combinations to shape, disrupt, and exploit adversarial use of the EM spectrum while protecting friendly freedom of action in that spectrum. Expanding reliance on the EM spectrum for i nformational purposes increases both the potential and the challeng es of EW in IO. The increasing prevalence of wireless telephone and computer usage extends both the utility a nd threat of EW, offering opportunities to exploit an adversary’s electronic vulnerabilities and a requirement to identify and protect such U.S. assets from similar exploitation. Computer Network Operations B-125. CNO are one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military op erations. CNO stem from the increasing use of networked computers and suppor ting infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations. Forces use CNO, alon g with EW, to attack, deceive, degr ade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure. For the purpose of milita ry operations, CNO are divided into CNA, CND, and related computer network exploitation (CNE) enabling operations. C NA consists of actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, de grade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themse lves. CND involves actions taken through the use of computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, de tect, and respond to unauthorized activity within DOD information systems and computer net works. CND actions not only protect DOD systems from an external adversary but also from exploitation fr om within, and are now a necessary function in all military operations. CNE is enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather da ta from target or adversary automated information systems or ne tworks. Because of the continued expansion of wireless networking and the integration of computers and radio frequen cy communications, there will be operations and capabilities that blur the line between CNO and EW, and that may require case-by-case determination when EW and CNO are assigned separate release authorities. B-126. The increasing reliance of unsophisticated militaries and terro rist groups on computers and computer networks to pass information to C2 forces reinforces the importance of CN O in UW plans and activities. As the capability of computers and the ra nge of their employment broaden, new vulnerabilities and opportunities will continue to develop. CNO offer both opportun ities to attack and exploit an adversary’s computer system weaknesses and a requirement to identify an d protect U.S. systems from similar attack or exploitation. B-127. Capabilities supporting IO include IA, physical security, physical attac k, CI, and COMCAM. These are either directly or indirectly involved in the information environment and con tribute to effective"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-24 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 IO. They should be integrated and coordinated with the core capabilit ies, but also serve other wider purposes. Information Assurance B-128. The U.S. military defines IA as measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication , confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. IA includes providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating prote ction, detection, and reaction capabilities. IA is necessary to gain and maintain information supe riority. IA requires a defense-in-depth approach that integrates the capabilities of pe ople, operations, and technology to establish multilayer and multidimensional protection to ensure survivability a nd mission accomplishment. IA assumes others can gain access to information and information systems from i nside and outside DOD-controlled networks. In joint organizations, IA is a responsib ility of the J-6. B-129. UW depends on IA to protect information and information systems, thereby assuring continuous capability. IA and IO have an operational relationship in which IO are concerned with the coordination of military activities in the information environment, while IA protect s the electronic and automated portions of the information environment. IA and all aspects of CNO are interrelated and rel y upon each other to be effective. IO relies on IA to protect infrastructure to ensure its availability to position information for influence purposes and for the delivery of information to the adversary. Conversely, IA relies on IO to provide operational protection with coordinated OPSEC, EP, CND, and CI against adversary IO or intelligence efforts directed against friendly el ectronic information or information systems. Physical Security B-130. Physical security is that part of security concer ned with physical measures designed to safeguard personnel and to prevent unauthorized access to equipm ent, installations, materi al, and documents against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. The physical security process includes determining vulnerabilities to known threats; applying appropriate deterrent, control, and denial safegua rding techniques and measures; and responding to changing conditions. B-131. Just as IA protects friendly el ectronic information and information systems, physical security protects physical facilities containing information and information systems worldwide. Physical security often contributes to OPSEC, particularly in the case of MILDEC, when comp romise of the MILDEC activity could compromise the real plan. UW plans may require significant physical security resources and the J-3 must understand this requirement as early as possible in the pla nning process. Physical Attack B-132. Physical attack disrupts, damages, or destroys adversary targets through de structive power. Forces can also use physical attack to create or alter adversary perceptions or drive an adversary to use certain exploitable information systems. Ph ysical attack can be employed in support of UW as a means of attacking C2 nodes to affect enemy ability to exercise C2 and to infl uence TAs. Commanders can employ IO capabilities, for example PSYOP, in support of physi cal attack to maximize the effect of the attack on the morale of an adversary. The integration and sync hronization of fires with IO through the targeting process is fundamental to creating the necessary synergy between IO and mo re traditional maneuver and strike operations. To achieve this integration, commanders must be able to define the effects they seek to achieve and staffs will incorporate these capabilities into the commander’s plan. Specifically, because of the fast-paced conduct of air operati ons, it is crucial that the planning and execution of both IO and air operations be conducted concurrently to produce the most effective target ing plan. Counterintelligence B-133. CI consists of information gathered and activitie s conducted to protect against espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted b y or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations, foreign pers ons, or international terrorist activities. The CI programs in joint staffs are a responsibility of the CI and human intell igence staff element of the intelligence directorate. CI procedures are a critical pa rt of guarding friendly information and information"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Informational Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 B-25 systems. A robust security program that integrates IA, physical secu rity, CI, and OPSEC with risk management procedures offers the best chance to protect friendly information and in formation systems from adversary actions. CNO provide some of the tools needed to conduc t CI operations. For the IO planner, CI analysis offers a view of the adversary’s information-gathe ring methodology. From this, CI can develop the initial intelligence targ et opportunities that provide access to the a dversary for MILDEC information, PSYOP products, and CNA/CNE actions. Combat Camera B-134. The COMCAM mission is to provide the OSD, the CJCS, the military depart ments, the COCOMs, and the JTF with an imagery capability in support of operational and planning requirements across the range of military operations. The COMCAM is responsible for rapid development and di ssemination of products that support strategic and operational IO objectives. The COMCAM program belongs to the defense visual information directorate, which falls under th e assistant secretary of defense for public affairs. The JFC and subordinate commanders can delega te operational control of COMCAM forces to any echelon of command. The IO staff at the JFC, component, and subordinate unit level s may coordinate the COMCAM. The commander with opera tional control can assign COMCAM teams to SOF or other specific units. B-135. COMCAM supports all of the capabilities of IO that use images of U.S. or friendly force operations, whether to influence an adversary or othe r TAs or support U.S. fo rces or allies. COMCAM provides images for PSYOP, MILD EC, PA, and CMO use. However, COMCAM can also be used for BDA/MOE analysis. COMCAM can also provide records of IO acti ons for subsequent rebuttal proceedings. However, the command must control COMC AM imagery to ensure that OPSEC is maintained and valuable information is not released to the ad versary. The quality and format, including digital video/still photography and ni ght and thermal imagery, means that CO MCAM products can be provided to professional news organizations by PA when they are unable to provide t heir own imagery. B-136. There are three military functions—PA, CMO, and DSPD—specified as rela ted capabilities for IO. These capabilities make significant contributions to IO and mu st always be coordinated and integrated with the core and supporting IO capabilitie s. However, IO must not compromise the primary purpose and rules under which PA, CMO, and DSPD operate. Avoi ding compromise requires additional care and consideration in the planning and co nduct of UW. For this reason, the PA and CMO staffs particularly must work in close coordination with the IO planning staff. Public Affairs B-137. PA are those public information, command in formation, and community relations activities directed toward both external and in ternal audiences with interest in the DOD. PA is essential for j oint forces information superiority, and credible PA operations are necessary to support the commander’s mission and maintain essential public liaisons. PA’s princi pal focus is to inform domestic and international audiences of joint operations to support COCOM public information need s. B-138. PA and IO must be coordinated and synchronized to ensure that personnel com municate consistent themes and messages to maintain credibility. As with other core, supporting, and related IO capabilities related IO capabilities, PA has a role in all aspect s of DOD’s missions and functions. Communication of operational matters to internal and external audiences is just one part of PA’s function. In performing duties as one of the primary spokesmen, the PA officer’s inte raction with the IO staff enables PA activities to be integrated, coordinated, and deconflicted with IO. Wh ile intents differ, PA and IO ultimately support the dissemination of information, themes, and messages adapted to their audi ences. PA contributes to the achievement of military objectives, for instance, by countering advers ary misinformation and disinformation through the publication of accurate information. PA also assi sts OPSEC by ensuring that the media are aware of the implications of premature re lease of information. Th e embedding of media in combat units offers new opportunities, as well as risks, for the media an d the military; the PA staff has a key role in establishing rules for embedding media personnel. Many adversaries re ly on limiting their population’s knowledge to remain in power; PA and IO provide ways to get the joint forces’ messages to these populations."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Appendix B B-26 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Civil-Military Operations B-139. CMO are the activities of a commander that establish, maintain , influence, or exploit relations between military forces, governmental and nongovernmental civilian o rganizations and authorities, and the civilian populace. CMO are conducted across the spectru m of conflict to address r oot causes of instability, assist in reconstruction after conflict or disaster, or support U.S. national security objectives. CMO can occur in friendly, neutral, or hostile operational areas to facilitate military operations and achieve U.S. objectives. CMO may include performance by military forces of activities and functions that are normally the responsibility of local, regional, or national government. These a ctivities may occur before, during, or subsequent to other military actions. CMO may be performed by designat ed CA, by other military forces, or by a combination of CA and other forces. Certain types of organizations ar e particularly suited to this mission and form the nucleus of CMO. These units are typically CA and PSYOP units. Others units, such as other SOF, engineers, health service support, transp ortation, military police, and security forces, may act as enablers. Personnel skilled in the language and culture of the popu lation are essential to CMO. B-140. CMO can be particularly effective in peacetime and precombat and postcombat operations when other capabilities and actions may be constrained. Early conside ration of the civil-military environment in which operations will take place is important. As with PA, the CMO st aff also has an important role to play in the development of broader UW plans and objectiv es. As the accessibility of in formation to the widest public audiences increases and as forces increasingly conduct military operations in open environments, the importance of CMO to the achievement of UW objectiv es will increase. At the same time the direct involvement of CMO with core, supporting, and rela ted IO capabilities (for instance, PSYOP, CNO, and CI) will also increase. CMO, by their nature, usually affect public percepti ons in their immediate locale. Distribution of information about CMO efforts a nd results through PA and PSYOP can affect the perceptions of a broader audience and favorably influence key groups or indi viduals. Defense Support to Public Diplomacy B-141. DSPD consists of activities and measures taken by DOD components, not solely in the area of IO, to support and facilitate public diplomacy efforts of the USG. The DOD contributes to PD, which includes those overt international information activities of the USG design ed to promote U.S. foreign policy objectives by seeking to understand, inform, and influence foreign audiences a nd opinion makers and by broadening the dialogue between American citizens and instit utions and their counterparts abroad. When approved, commanders may employ PSYOP assets in support of DSPD as part of security cooperation initiatives or in support of U.S. Embassy PD programs . Much of the operational-level IO activity conducted in any theater will be directly linked to PD obj ectives. DSPD requires co ordination with both the interagency and among DOD components.

International trade is the exchange of goods and services across int ernational boundaries or territories. In most countries, it represents a significant share of the gross domes tic product (GDP). While international trade has been present throughout much of history, its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centurie s. Industrialization, ad vanced transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing a ll have a major impact on what is politically and militarily possible. Increasing international trade—an economic and fi nancial function—is the primary meaning of globalization. R EGULATION OF I NTERNATIONAL T RADE D-2. Traditionally, bilateral treaties between states regulated trades. For centuries, most states maintained high tariffs and many other restrictions on international trade through a belief in mercantilist trade theory. In the 19th century, especi ally in Britain, a belief in free trade became paramount. Si nce that time, this view has dominated the thinking among we stern nations. In the years sinc e WWII, multilateral treaties and organizations, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and th e WTO, have attempted to create a globally regulated trade structure enforced thro ugh diplomatic pressure and international law. D-3. Usually, the most economically powerful nations support free trade, alt hough they often engage in selective protectionism of some domestic industries that are politically important (the protective tariffs applied to agriculture and textiles by the United Stat es, Europe, and Japan, for example). The Netherlands and Great Britain were both strong advocates of free tr ade when they were econom ically dominant. Today, the United States, the UK, Australia, and Japan are fr ee trade’s greatest proponents. However, many other countries, such as India, China, and Russia, are increasingly advocatin g free trade as their economic power increases. As tariff levels fall, there is also an in creasing willingness to negotiate nontariff measures, including foreign direct investment, alternative procurement, and trade facilitation. D-4. At the global level, the WTO regulates international trade. Several other re gional arrangements, such as Mercosur in South America; NAFTA between th e United States, Canada, and Mexico; and the EU between 27 independent states, regulate internationa l trade as well. The 2005 Buenos Aires talks on the planned establishment of the Free Tr ade Area of the Americas failed, largely because of opposition from the populations of Latin American nations. Similar agreements, such a s the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, have also failed in recent years. D-5. Some nations support the regulation of international trade because of risks inherent in the free trade ideal. Free trade makes economic sense because the elim ination of artificial costs and barriers lowers the cost of goods and services. However, comparative advantage would automatical ly flow to those producers with natural advantages (such as favorable climates for agriculture or natural resources) or artificial advantages based on preexisting conditions (such as cheap—or even “slave”—la bor or a well-developed industrial base). While free trade theory may be economically sound, it can be disruptive to markets, industries, and entire societies. Throughout history, un resolved trade disputes, perceptions of interstate exploitation, seizure of assets, or denial of access to markets or reso urces have caused wars. Given the political consequences inherent in such international trad e, it is unsurprising that states attempt to use state power to seek advantage for their economic enterprises through various e conomic weapons. Some of the economic weapons employed by nations throughout history include— Market penetration. Protectionism or trade sanctions. Trade wars."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Appendix D D-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 D-6. Market penetration is the “offen sive” (deliberate) attempt to enter another nation’s economy to secure a market for one’s goods and se rvices. Because this penetration co mpetes with indigenous suppliers, it may be unwelcome for economic, political, cultural, or other reasons. As businesses compete for market dominance, some market penetration may involve the us e of aggressive techniques to subdue and even eliminate market competitors. Typical tools of market penetration used throughout history include— Military and political conquest . An invader can impose controls on supply and market access. This extreme action can be a pretext for broad-based general war. Market creation . This comprises fostering a demand for goods and services that tradition ally is unprecedented. Developing a widespread demand fo r opium in China or a taste for Asian tea in Britain by British companies are examples. Monopoly . If an external power can control the only supply of a good or service that i s in demand, it can not only dominate the indigenous market but also demand higher pri ces. Subsidized industry and dumping . If a government provides subsidies to its industry such that the industry does not compete for inputs similar to its international comp etitors, that industry will have an artificial advantage in producing goods and services. Competitors can then sell those goods and services at a lower price than indigenous products. Left unchallenged, s uch “dumping” can force the indigenous suppliers to go out of business, leading in theory to a supply monopoly and market domination by the foreign provider. D-7. Protectionism is the economic policy of restrainin g trade between nations through methods such as high tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, a variety of restrictive government regulations designed to discourage imports, and antidumping laws in an attempt to protect domes tic industries in a particular nation from foreign takeover or competition. This po licy contrasts with theoretical free trade. Free trade institutes no artificial barriers to entry. Protectionism is mostly u nderstood as policies that protect businesses and stable labor forces by restricting or regulating trade betw een foreign nations. Protectionist “weapons” of the economic in strument of power include— Intervention . Any use of state power to bolster an economic entity. Such “artificial” acti ons are outside of the normal economic laws of supply and demand in a free market. Economic interventions have political dimensions that may or may not b e obvious to all. All of the following specific weapons are examples of intervention. Subsidies . These are targeted government allocations of money to protect existing busi nesses from risk associated with change, such as the costs of labor, materials, and so on. Protective tariffs . Tariffs are a form of tax designed to increase the price of a foreign competitor’s goods by artificially increasing the cost of imports on par or higher-than-domestic prices. Quotas . By restricting the amount of imports, quotas prevent th e introduction of competitive goods and services. Sometimes, st ates impose quotas to prevent the dumping of cheaper foreign goods that would overwhelm the market and drive indigenous suppliers out of business. Tax cuts . Tax cuts can function as a “reverse or shadow subsidy.” If the indig enous government makes targeted tax relief that alleviates the norm al burdens of social and business costs, these cuts can provide an artificial advantage to the indigenous busines s relative to foreign competitors. Trade restrictions . Trade restrictions include all mean s to frustrate the free import and competition of foreign goods. Typical restricti ons include bureaucratic requirements (red tape) for licensing, quality controls, safety inspections, quarantine, cult ural-sensitivity protestations, and so on. D-8. Protectionism has frequently been associated with economic theories such as mercantilism, the belief that it is beneficial to maintain a positive trade balance and i mport substitution. Protectionist actions may be standard policy or may be a reaction to the aggressive, sometimes unfa ir actions of foreign competitors. Such defensive, retaliatory actions are trade sanctions. They tend to arise in the context of an unresolved trade or policy dispute, such as a disagreement about the fairness of a policy affecting internationa l trade (imports or exports). For example, in 2002 the United States placed import tariffs on steel to protect the U.S. steel industry from more efficient foreign produc ers, such as China and Russia. The WTO ruled that"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Economic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 D-3 these tariffs were illegal. The EU threatened retaliatory tariffs (sanctions) on a range of U.S. goods, forcing the USG to remove the steel tariffs in early 2004. D-9. Trade sanctions are only one specific type of ec onomic power. Trade sanctions are regarded as political interventions in an otherwise free flow of economic goods and serv ices. Recently, the United States and multilateral partners threatened sanctions against Iran and North Korea in response to those regimes’ threat to develop nuclear arsenals. This is not primarily a trade s anction because the normal volume of trade between these nations and the United Stat es is already limited. St ates can manipulate other economic variables, such as grants of aid, credit, currency value manipulation, and acc ess to financing, to put direct or indirect pressure on other governments to modify politi cal behavior. D-10. Being frequently retaliatory in nature, trade and economic sanctions can rat chet out of control and lead to trade wars. A trade war refers to two or more nations increasing or creating tariffs or other trade barriers in retaliation for other trade barriers. It is th e opposite of free trade. Economists believe trade wars are nonproductive. They also believe that trade wars decrease th e economic welfare and total social surplus of all nations involved. Politically, however, the threat of a trade war is helpfu l in winning concessions. This is another example of the complex relationship between more than one instr ument of power—the diplomatic (political) and the economic. The WTO is the world governing body for trade disputes. D-11. Economic and financial flows are a natural charact eristic of the international environment and a fundamental activity of human society. When economic relations between two countries exist, most act ivity is conducted by economic sectors of society in general. The degree of s tate government direction or intervention in the economy will vary with the nature of each ruling reg ime. When state governments take action in international trade or economic disputes, they attempt to solve the dispute through bilateral diplomacy, multilateral diplomacy, and recourse to intern ational trade and legal bodies to seek honoring of agreements and international law enforcement. Failing a diplomatic solution or successful international arbitration, state governments can also intervene domestically by restric ting or blocking natural economic and financial flows. C ORPORATIONS D-12. Just as the state remains the central structural concept of internation al political relations, the company or corporation is the central structural concept of international economics. A corporation is a legal entity collectively owned by a number of natural person s or other legal entities. However, a corporation can exist completely separate from those entities. This separation gives the corporation unique powers that other legal entities lack. The laws of place of in corporation determine the extent and scope of a corporation’s status and capacity. D-13. Investors and entrepreneurs often form joint stoc k companies and incorporate them to facilitate a business; as this form of business is now extremely prev alent, the term “corporation” is often used to refer specifically to such business corp orations. Corporations may also be formed for local government (municipal corporation); political, religious, and charit able purposes (not-for-profit corporation); or government programs (government-owned corporation). Legal Status D-14. The law typically views a corporation as a fictional person, a legal person, o r a moral person (as opposed to a natural person). Under such a doctrine, a corporation enjoys ma ny of the rights and obligations of individual persons, such as the ability to own property, sign bindin g contracts, pay taxes, exercise certain constitutional rights, and otherwise par ticipate in society. On the other hand, corporations often have rights not granted to individuals, such as treaty rights. D-15. The most salient features of incorporation include— Limited liability . Unlike in a partnership or sole proprietorship, members of a corporation have “limited” liability for the corporation’s debts and obligations. Li mited liability allows anonymous trading in the shares of the corpora tion, greatly increases its ability to raise more funds for enterprises, and reduces investor risk. This, in turn, greatly increases both the number of willing investors and the amount they are likely to invest, thus adding liquidity and volume to the stock market."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Appendix D D-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Perpetual lifetime . The assets and structure of the corporation exist beyond the lifetime of any of its members or agents. Perpetual lifetime allows for stability and accumula tion of capital, which becomes available for investment in projects of a larger size and ov er a longer term than if the corporate assets remained subject to dissolution and distribution. The perpetual lifetime feature is an indication of the unbounded potential duration of the corporation’s existence, as well as its accumulation of wealth and thus power. In theory , a corporation can have its charter revoked at any time, putting an end to its existence as a legal entity. Howeve r, in practice, dissolution only occurs for corporations that request it or fail to meet annual filing requirem ents. Ownership and control . Humans and other legal entities composed of humans (such as trust s and other corporations) can have the right to vote or share in the profit of corporations . In the case of for-profit corporations, these voters hold shares of stock as proof of ownership of the corporation. This is why they are called shareholders or stockholders. W hen no stockholders exist, a corporation may exist as a nonstock corp oration. In this situation, the corporation has members who have the right to vote on the corpora tion’s operation instead of stockholders. If the nonstock corporation is not operated for profit, it is called a not-for-profit corporation. In either category, the corporation includes a collection of individuals with a distinct legal status and with special privileges not provided to ordinary unincorporated businesses, vol untary associations, or groups of individuals. D-16. Typically, a board of directors governs a corporatio n on the behalf of the members. The corporate members elect the directors, and the board has a fiduciary duty to look after the interests of the corporation. The board chooses the corporate officers, such as the chief executive officer, president, treasurer, and other titled officers, to manage the affairs of the corporation. D-17. Creditors, such as banks, can also control (in part) corporations. In return for lendi ng money to the corporation, creditors can demand a controlling interest similar to that of a shareholder, including one or more seats on the board of directors. Creditors do not “own ” the corporation as shareholders do but can outweigh the shareholders in practice, especially if th e corporation is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot survive without credit. D-18. Members of a corporation have a “residual interest .” Should the corporation end its existence, the members are the last to receive its assets, following cr editors and others with interests in the corporation. This can make investment in a corporation risky; however, the corporation’s l imited liability, which ensures that the members will only be liable for the amount they contribut ed, outweighs the risk. This only applies in the case of for-profit cor porations; nonprofits are not allowed to have residual benefits available to the members. Formation D-19. Historically, special charter of governments created corporations. Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or federal government and are regula ted by the laws enacted by that government. As part of this registration, corporations are often required to design ate the principal address and registered agent of the corporation. D-20. Generally, a corporation files articles of incorporation with the government, la ying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is to issue, and the names and addresse s of directors. Once the government approves the articles, the corporation’s directors meet to creat e bylaws that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and offi cer positions. D-21. The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporatio n operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a foreign corporation and is usually subject to laws of its hos t state pertaining to employment, crimes, contracts, and civil actions. The nature of the corporation cont inues to evolve through existing corporations pushing new ideas and structures, courts responding , and governments regulating in response to new situations."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Economic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 D-5 Development of Modern Commercial Corporations D-22. Early commercial corporations were formed under frameworks set up by governments of states to undertake tasks that appeared too risky or too expensive for individuals or governments . Many European nations chartered corporations to le ad colonial ventures, such as the Dutch East India Company, and these corporations came to play a large part in the history of corporate coloniali sm. D-23. The 20th century saw a proliferation of corporation-enabling law across the gl obe, which drove national economic booms, international development, and globalization. Sta rting in the 1980s, many countries with large, state-owned corporations move d toward privatization—the selling of publicly owned services and enterprises to private, normally corporate, ownership. Deregulation—reducing the public-interest regulation of corporate activity—often accompanied privati zation IAW policies based on minimal government interference economic theory. Another major postwar shif t was toward development of conglomerates, in which large corporations purcha sed smaller corporations to expand their industrial base. Japanese firms developed a horizontal conglomeration model, the keiretsu , which other countries later duplicated. While corporate effici ency (and profitability) skyrocketed, small shareholder control diminished and directors of corporations assumed greater control over business, cont ributing in part to the hostile takeover movement of the 1980s and the accounting scan dals that brought down Enron and WorldCom following the turn of the century. D-24. More recent corporate developments include downsizing; contracting-out, or outs ourcing; offshoring; and narrowing activities to core business as information technol ogy, global trade regimes, and cheap fossil fuels enable corporations to reduce and externalize labor costs, transpor tation costs, and transaction costs and thereby maximize profits. Types of Corporations D-25. Most corporations register with the local jurisdiction as either a stock corporation or a nonstock corporation. Stock corporations represent ownership of the corporation by shares of stock. A stock corporation is generally a for-profit corporation. A n onstock corporation does not have owners. However, it may have members who have voting rights in the corporation. Some jurisdictions (for example, Washington, DC) separate corporations into for-profit and nonpro fit instead of stock and nonstock. D-26. The institution most often referenced by the word “corporation” is a public or publicly traded corporation, the shares of which ar e traded on a public market (for ex ample, the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) specifically designed for the buying and selling of shares of stock o f corporations by and to the general public. Most of the largest businesses in the world are pu blicly traded corporations. However, the majority of corporations are cl osely held, privately held, or close corporations, meaning that no ready market exists for the trading of ownership interests. A small group of business people or companies own and manage many such corporations, although the size these corporations can be a s vast as the largest public corporations. D-27. The affairs of publicly traded an d closely held corporations are similar in many respects. The main difference in most countries is that publicly traded corporations have the b urden of complying with additional securities laws and stricter corporate governance stand ards. Though the laws governing organizations may differ, the courts often interpret provisions of the law that apply to profit-making enterprises in a similar manner when applying principles to nonprofit orga nizations—as the underlying structures of these two types of entities often resemble each other. Multinational Corporations D-28. Following on the success of the corporate model at a national level, m any corporations have become MNCs or transnational corporations (TNCs), growin g beyond national boundaries to attain sometimes remarkable positions of power and influence in the process of globalizing. D-29. The typical TNC or MNC may fit into a web of overlapping ownerships and directors hips, with multiple branches and lines in different regions, and many such subgroupings compri sing corporations in their own right. Growth by expansion may favor national or regional branches; growth by acquisition or merger can result in an excess of groupings spanning the globe, with structures and names that do not"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Appendix D D-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 always make the structures of ownership and interactio n clear. In the spread of corporations across multiple continents, the importance of corporate culture has gr own as a unifying factor and a counterweight to local-national sensibilities and cultural awareness. D-30. MNCs can powerfully influence international relations, given their large economic influence in politicians’ representative districts, as well as their extens ive financial resources available for public relations and political lobbying. MNCs play an important role in globa lization. Given their international reach and mobility, prospective countries and sometime s regions within countrie s must compete with each other to have MNCs locate their facilities (and subsequent tax revenue , employment, and economic activity) within their borders. To compete, countries and regional political districts offer incentives to MNCs, such as tax breaks, pledges of governmental assistance or improved infrastructure, or lax environmental and labor standards. D-31. MNCs try to affect government policy through lobby ing and donating to politicians that management feels will be supportive of corporate goals on topics ranging from tariff structures through labor laws to environmental regulations. However, there is no unified multinati onal perspective on any of these issues because MNCs have different competitive goals between and within industries. D-32. By contrast, there are many more actions taken by governments to affect corpora te behavior. From nationalization (forcing a company to sell local assets to the governme nt or to other local nationals) to a host of changes in laws and regulations to which business must re spond, it is more realistic to think of business-government relations as a constant push-and-pull between adversarie s that periodically make peace and move together in a single direction. INSTRUMENTS OF UNITED ST ATES ECONOMIC POWER D-33. The following paragraphs discuss the instruments of U.S. economic power. Most of these instruments are units of the DOC. The United States Agency for Internati onal Development, however, is an independent agency under the general guidance of the State Department. D EPARTMENT OF C OMMERCE D-34. The mission of the department is to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domest ic commerce of the United States. Because of legislative and admini strative additions, this mi ssion evolved to encompass the responsibility to foster, serve, and promote the nation’s economic de velopment and technological advancement. Some of the ways the department fulfills this miss ion is by— Participating with OGAs in the creation of nati onal policy through the President’s cabinet and its subdivisions. Promoting and assisting international trade. Strengthening the international economic position of the United St ates. Ensuring effective use and growth of the na tion’s scientific and technical resources. Acquiring, analyzing, and disseminating information regarding the nation an d the economy to achieve increased social and economic benefit. Assisting states, communities, and individuals with economic pr ogress. D-35. The USG divided the department into several primary operating units, among which the I nternational Trade Administration (ITA) is the primary instrument of official U.S. economic powe r abroad. The ITA includes the following subunits: Trade Promotion and the United St ates and Foreign Commercial Service (TP/US&FCS), the Import Administration, Market Access and Compliance, and Manufacturing and Services (M&S). International Trade Administration D-36. The ITA plans, determines, and coordinates policy; directs the progra ms; and oversees all activities of ITA. The ITA coordinates all issues concerni ng import administration, trade law enforcement, agreements compliance, international trade and commercial policy, trad e promotion, and trade competitiveness. In the absence of the Secretary of Commerce, the Under Secretary for ITA represents the DOC on the Trade Policy Committee as an ex officio member of the board of the Export-Import Bank of"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Economic Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 D-7 the United States and as chair of the Trade Pr omotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC). The Under Secretary also serves, as assigned, on all other secret arial-level boards, committees, or panels focusing on international trade. The Under Secretary has primar y responsibility for developing and implementing the President’s National Export Strategy in conjunction with the TPCC. United States and Foreign Commercial Service D-37. The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) is a subunit that directs the ITA’s export promotion programs and develops and implements a unified goal-setting and ev aluation process to increase trade assistance to small and medium-sized bu sinesses. The US&FCS integrates its activities with the rest of the ITA. It directs a program of interna tional trade events, market re search, and export-related trade-information products and serv ices. It also directs programs th at help U.S. firms to compete successfully for major projects and pr ocurements worldwide through strate gic, comprehensive, and focused advocacy support. Trade Promotion and the United States and Foreign Commercial Service (International Operations) D-38. The TP/US&FCS (International Operations) subunit administers a system of ove rseas posts located in commercial centers throughout the world that, IAW the annual country co mmercial guide, support and carry out trade promotion activities. It develops marketing and commerc ial intelligence, facilitates U.S. investments, and assists in the monitoring and compliance with U.S. rights and opportunities created by trade agreements. It also supports ITA import admi nistration activities and provides representation to host governments on behalf of U.S. business firms. The senior commercial officer in a country has overall responsibility for all ITA activities and personnel in that country. Trade Promotion and the United States and Foreign Commercial Service TP/US&FCS (Domestic Operations) D-39. The TP/US&FCS (Domestic Operations) subunit administers a syste m of U.S. export assistance centers located in commercial cente rs throughout the United States that offer export-ready U.S. firms overseas marketing counseling, technical export inform ation, and marketing opportunities and strategies guidance. It disseminates information on trade developments and trade poli cy issues to the business community. The subunit provides a co mprehensive platform of export assistance services throughout the United States to assist U.S. firms in entering or ex panding their presence in overseas markets, including counseling, trade events, and outreach. It establishes program partnerships with state and federal agencies and other public and private sector entities to create an efficien t export-assistance network for U.S. companies. Market Access and Compliance D-40. This subunit advises on the analysis, formulation, and implementation of U.S. international economic policies of a bilateral, multilateral, or regional nature and ensures that trade obj ectives align with U.S. foreign policy. It improves market access by U.S. companies to overs eas markets and strengthens the international trade and investment position of the United Stat es. Import Administration D-41. This subunit ensures the proper administration of antidumping and counte rvailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. These duties include the tim ely conduct of investigations and administrative reviews, the administration of AD/CVD findings and orders, the issuance of instructions di recting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect duties under those findings and orders, and the admi nistration of AD/CVD suspension agreements and other related bilateral and mu ltilateral trade agreements. It assists the Office of the Chief Counsel for Import Administration in its responsibilities for the defense of litigation challenging actions taken by the department under the AD/CVD laws and other laws and conduc ts negotiations with foreign manufacturers or governments to suspend AD/CVD investigations."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Appendix D D-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 D-42. In conjunction with the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Import Adminis tration subunit recommends remedial action to the Pr esident upon a finding by the Bureau of Industry and Security that imports threaten national security. It administers tr ade agreements with foreign governments in product areas and ensures the continued full access to trade re medy laws by U.S. indus try. Import Administration implements WTO and key bilateral agreements by st rengthening enforcement efforts to combat illegal transshipment and participating in negotiations or consu ltations on matters of transshipment, classification, and investigation. It also administers classification and categorization se minars for foreign governments, issues visa agreements and visa waiver s, and identifies barriers to trade. Manufacturing and Services D-43. This subunit serves as the primary liaison with U. S. industry and trade associations to help address the U.S. industry’s concerns and to support U.S. i ndustry’s competitiveness. It advises on domestic and international trade and investment policies affecting the competit iveness of U.S. industry and carries on a program of research and analysis on manufacturing and services. Based on this analys is and interaction with U.S. industry, it develops strategies, policies, and programs to strengthen the competitive position of U.S. industries in the domestic and world markets. D-44. M&S administers the market development cooperator program and congressionall y mandated grants. It manages the industry trade advisory program (joi ntly with the U.S. Trade Representative) and other advisory committees. M&S provides staff support for the President’s e xport council and coordinates the department’s participation on the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. U NITED S TATES A GENCY FOR I NTERNATIONAL D EVELOPMENT D-45. The USAID is an independent agency that recei ves general direction and overall foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State. The USAID admi nisters U.S. economic a nd humanitarian assistance programs designed to promote sustainable development in countries worldwide. O verseas missions that work in close coordination with U.S. Embassies administer USAID assist ance programs. The USAID works to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives of shaping a freer, more secure, a nd more prosperous world by focusing its programs in five interrelated areas. These include— Improving health and population conditions. Protecting the environment. Promoting economic growth and agricultural development. Building human capacity through education and training. Supporting democracy. D-46. In addition to providing humanitarian assistance, USAID promotes d emocratic values and international cooperation and helps establish economic conditions that expand markets for U.S. goods and services in developing countries. The agency funds technical assistance and comm odity assistance, trains thousands of foreign students each year at U.S. colle ges, and supports development research. USAID also enlists the collaboration of the United States for-profit private sector, nongovernmental and private organizations, and universities in its programs. Money spent on foreign a ssistance programs in the United States is usually in the form of purchases of food, equipment, and services se nt overseas. Nearly 80 percent of USAID contracts and grants go to U.S. firms for such purchases."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 E-1 Appendix E The Financial Instrument of National Power THE INTERNATIONAL FI NANCIAL ENVIRONMENT E-1. In addition to its economic functions and capacities, money has acqu ired other secondary social and psychological powers that may be exercised either by the expenditure of money or by its mere possession. These include the power to enhance popularity, status, and prestige; th e capacity to enhance the sense of self-worth; and the power to attain or influence political power. E-2. A number of commodity money systems were among the earliest forms of money to em erge. Examples include iron bars; cowry shells; salt; ingots of copper, silver, and gold; ru m; and cash crops, such as tobacco, rice, indigo, or maize. In recent experience struggling ag ainst al-Qaeda and global terrorist networks, it was discovered that the “hawala system” of clandestine terr orist financing was organized around a trade in honey. Under a commodity money system, the objects used as money ha ve intrinsic value; that is, they have value beyond their use as money. For example, gold co ins retain value because of gold’s useful physical properties besi des its value because of monetary usage, whereas paper notes are only worth as much as the monetary value assigned to them. Groups usually adopt com modity money to simplify transactions in a barter economy, and so it functions first as a medi um of exchange. E-3. Some forms of commodity money are too bulky and difficult to transport, lea ding to the invention of more practical symbolic substitute s. Goldsmiths’ receipts became an accepted substitu te for gold in 17th century England. The goldsmiths were the precursors of banks, and th e receipts they issued were the precursors of the banknote. Through most of the 19th century, commercial ba nks in Europe and North America issued their own banknotes based on the same principle of partial backing. From there it was only one further step to create true fiat money, currency with negligible inherent value and no backing of a commodity. A central authority (government) creates new money by issuing paper c urrency or creating new bank deposits. The central authority mandating the money’s acceptance as legal tender under penalty of law and demanding this money in payment of taxes or tribute most frequentl y enhances fiat money’s widespread acceptance. By the early 1970s, almost all countries had a bandoned the gold standard and converted their national currencies to pure fiat money. S OCIAL E VOLUTION OF M ONEY E-4. Money is an invention of the human mind. The creation of money is possible because hum an beings have the capacity to accord value to symbols. Money is a symbol th at represents the value of goods and services. The acceptance of any object as money—be it wampum, a gold coin, a paper currency note, or a digital bank account balance—involves the consent of both the individu al user and the community. Thus, all money has a psychological and social as well as an economic dimension. Characteristics E-5. Money is generally considered to have the followi ng three characteristics an d associated features: It is a medium of exchange . A medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system. It should have liquidity and be easily tradable, easily transportable, and durable. It is a unit of account . A unit of account is a standard nu merical unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. A unit of account is a prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt. It should be divisible into sm all units without destroying its value; fung ible (one unit or piece must be exactly equivalent to another); and it must be a specific weight, measure, or size to be verifiably countable."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Appendix E E-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 It is a store of value . To act as a store of value, commodity, form of money, or financial capital, it must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved—and be predictabl y useful when retrieved. Therefore, it should be durable, of stable value, and difficult to counterfeit (and the genuine must be easily recognizable). Money also is typically that whi ch has the least declining marginal utility (meaning that as more units accumu late, each unit is worth about the same as the prior units and not substantially less). E-6. Moreover, libertarians and most laissez-faire economi sts would argue that an additional characteristic is that money is anonymous. This view requires that money is not subject to governme nt tracking or does not require any equipment, tools, or electricity to use and is useable for purchase s in a black market. Modern Forms E-7. People commonly use banknotes (also known as paper money) and coins (the mos t liquid forms of tangible money) for small person-to-person transactions. Today, people com monly use gold as a store of value but not often as a medium of exchange or a unit of account (although central bank s do use gold as a unit of account). Less tangible forms of money exist that nevertheless serve the same functions as money. Checks, debit cards, and wire transfers are an easy means to transfer larger amounts of money between bank accounts. Electronic money is an entirely nonphysical currency that pe ople use and trade over the Internet. Credit E-8. People often loosely refer to credit as money. People use money to buy goods and ser vices, whereas people use credit to buy goods and services on the promis e to pay with money in the future. This distinction between money and credit causes much confusion in discussions of monetary theory. In lay terms, people frequently use the terms credit and money interchangeably. For example, bank depo sits are generally included in summations of the national broad money supply. However, any detaile d study of monetary theory recognizes the proper dis tinction between money and credit. Creation of Money E-9. Although people easily identify and distinguish types of money, the act ual nature of money and the manner in which it is created is less easily understood. Th e fact that commodities, su ch as gold, silver, furs, or tobacco leaves, have value does not make any of them money. Commoditie s only become money when people widely accept them as a symbol representing a cer tain value of goods and services and in exchange for other goods and services of commensurate perceived value. Trust in the commodity’s authenticity and universal acceptance and confidence in the availability of goods and services for redemption are essential criteria. E-10. Later, banks became the principle source of new money. Banks take in dep osits and issue loans to borrowers either by paying out some of the currency receipted on deposit or simply by c reating a new deposit in the borrower’s account without receiving currency to back it up. By this means, banks create many times more money than the amount they receive or hold on deposit. In turn, central banks further multiply the amount of currency and demand deposits by printing additional currency and using it to purchase government bonds or by lending it to commercial banks by creating fresh depo sits at the central bank for the bank just as the bank does for its own borrowers. Economic Value of Money E-11. The value of money depends on what it can purchase, not what it is made of. Fiat m oney has value because people can use it to purcha se goods and services, even though it has no intrinsic value or utility other than as a medium of exchange. The intrinsic value of gold and s ilver remains unaltered by the quantity available. However, their value as a medium of exchang e is directly dependent on the availability of goods and services for sale. When explorers discovered huge quantities of gold and even larger amounts of silver in the New World and brought the gold and silver back to Europe for con version into coin, the purchasing power of those coins fell by 60 to 80 perc ent. Prices of commodities rose because the supply of goods for sale did not keep pace with the increased supply of money. In addition, the relative value of silver"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Financial Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 E-3 to gold shifted dramatically downward. The government s that issue today’s nationa l currencies back them, not gold or silver. The governments are backed by the productive capacity of the societies they represent. Problems With Paper as Money E-12. Because of the ease of production, paper money may lose value through infl ation, and in today’s electronic era, vast quantities of money can be created with a few key strokes. Perhaps the biggest criticism of paper money is that its stability is generally subject to the wh im of government regulation rather than the disciplines of mark et phenomena. Money and Economy E-13. Money is one of the most central topics studied in economics, and th e value of money is the central concept in finance. Monetarism is an economic theory that predominantly deals wi th the supply and demand for money. Monetary policy aims to manage money supply, inflation, and int erest to affect output and employment. Inflation is the decrease in the value of a specific currency over time. Dramatic increases in the money supply can cause such a decrease of value. The interest rate (the cost of borrowing money) is an important tool used to control inflation and economic growth in monetary econ omics. Governments often make central banks responsible for monitoring and controlling the money supply, interest rates, and banking. E-14. A monetary crisis can have very significant economi c effects, particularly if it leads to monetary failure and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happene d in Russia, for example, after the fall of the Soviet Union. There have been many historical arguments regar ding the combination of money’s functions, some arguing that they need more sepa ration and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. Financial capital is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniform ly recognized tender. Money Supply E-15. The money supply is the amount of money available within a specific economy a vailable for purchasing goods or services. The money supply in th e United States exists in four escalating categories: M0, M1, M2, and M3. The categories grow in size with M3 representing all f orms of money (including credit) and M0 representing only base money (coins, bills, and central bank deposits). M0 is also money that can satisfy private banks’ reserve requirements. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the Euro area, the respective institution is the European Central Bank. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the Bank of Japan, People’s Bank of China, and the Bank of England. Social and Psychological Value of Money E-16. Money is so universally valued that people consider its value self-evi dent. Money today is valued for the products and services for which it can be exchanged, the security it provides ag ainst unexpected needs, the economic power it generates, the political influence it exerts, the social status it offers to those who possess it, and the self-confidence and sense of accomplishment it fost ers in those who earn it. Linkages Between Money and Other Social Institutions E-17. The evolution of money illustrates how each new social institution creates linkages with other existing social institutions as it develops and how those linkag es gradually expand into complex networks of relationships until they become inseparable elements of a si ngle social web. The evolution of money began as a medium of exchange and measure of value. Money thus served as a stimulant f or the exchange of goods and services. As a medium for storage of value, it gave rise to banking. By cre ating and lending money, banks became catalysts for the further developmen t of trade and industry. In the form of taxation, money supported the development of government. These linkages are direct expressions o f the primary powers of money to facilitate transactions."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Appendix E E-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 E-18. In addition, money exercises secondary influences on the society. Pol itically, the right to collect taxes helped monarchies centralize power and influence into national government s. At a later stage, the ever-increasing need of that government for more funds made it increasingly depen dent and subject to those sections of society that possessed or controlled large sums of money. The En glish Parliament eventually wrested power from the king by first acquiring the sole right t o raise taxes, paving the way for democracy. Later, the wealthy merchant class acquired increasing infl uence over the political establishment. Socially, money has helped breakdown the rigid class structure th at allocated privileges according to one’s birth. In a mone y economy, access to goods and services is based on the capacity to pay rather than one’s social origins. Thus, it helps elimin ate social discrimination based on caste and class. Private Currencies E-19. In many countries, laws have severely restricted th e issue of private paper currencies. In the so-called free banking era (1837 to 1866), some 8,000 private banks in the United States issued priv ate money. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the government licensed private sector ba nks to print their own paper money. Today, privately issued electronic money is in circulation. Histori c forms of money, such as gold (as in the case of digital gold currency), back some of these private currenci es. Transactions in these currencies represent an annual turnover value in billions of U.S. do llars. E-20. Any material can back privately i ssued money. The material used to back money changes with the times—and sometimes to avoid legal scrutiny. This make s things, such as energy, transport capacity, food, honey, illegal drugs, and so on, more useful for backing money. It is impor tant for Soldiers to understand that money is, above all, an agreem ent to use something as a medium of exchange. It is up to a community (or to the entity that holds the power within a community—state governme nt, MNC, nonstate actor) to decide whether money should be backed by a certain material or should be to tally virtual. Future of Money E-21. In recent years, the European Monetary Union introduced the Euro to many Eu ropean nations. Now, almost all use one currency (the UK and Sweden ar e notable exceptions). West Africa is proposing the 2009 introduction of the Eco, a new currency for 5 or 6 nations. Some speculate that a North American currency, such as the Amero, might come next. Some are proposing an Asian currency unit as well. In the Middle East, many nations use the dinar. An Islamic gold dinar is also propo sed. In Mexico, there is a movement to return to using silver as money. One difficulty with currency bloc ks unifying paper currencies is that it may eliminate the ability to exchange trillions of do llars on currency markets. If this kind of trading were to move into the gold and silver market s, the prices for gold and silver could soar. Today, people can trade gold and paper mone y electronically via online systems. Practice and Organizations of International Finance E-22. International finance is the branch of economics that studies the dynami cs of exchange rates and foreign investment, as well as their affects on interna tional trade. International financial organizations study and influence the effects of these phenomena. Exchange Rates E-23. The exchange rate (also known as the foreign exchange rate) betw een two currencies specifies how much one currency is worth in terms of the other. For example, an exchange rate of 120 Japa nese yen (JPY) to the United States dollar (USD) means that 120 JPY is worth the same as 1 USD. The foreign exchange market is one of the largest markets in the world. Experts estimate that approximately 2 trillion USD worth of currency changes hands on the market every day. Th e spot exchange rate refers to the current exchange rate. The forward exchange rate is an exchange rate that members of the financial arena quote and trade today for delivery and payment at specified later date. E-24. In the international arena, currency exchange rates matter to a state’s economy for inverse reasons. A relatively strong or appreciating currency provides the home country w ith more purchasing power abroad. Moreover, foreigners will want to hold strong curren cies in their financial holdings (U.S. debt, for example). In this case, such foreign-held debt can be used by the USG to finance major expenditures (like"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Financial Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 E-5 the WOT or massive infrastructure projects). However, domestic goods for export will be more expensive for foreigners to purchase, which reduces export sale s and affects the balance of international trade. Conversely, a relatively w eak or depreciating home currency reduces purchasing power abroad but increases the affordability to foreigners of domestic go ods for export, thus increasing sales. In addition, depreciating currencies will become increasingly unattractive to foreign currency investors, decreasing the amount of debt they are willing to hold. In the case of the USG, such foreign unwillingness to hold U.S. debt constrains the ability to finance massive expenditures. Free or Pegged E-25. If a currency is free-floating, its exchange rate va ries against that of other currencies and market forces determine supply and demand. Exchange rates for such currencies are likely to change almost constantly as quoted on financial markets, mainly banks, around the world . By contrast, a movable or adjustable peg system is a system of artificially fixed exchange rates determined by one or more state governments. For example, between 1994 and 2005, the Chinese yuan (CNY) was pe gged to the USD at 8.2768 CNY to 1 USD. Many countries have pegged their currencies to the USD at vari ous times, as Japan and Western Europe did from World War II until the 19 70s. Fixed exchange rates can have benefits for both the U.S. and foreign states. For example, export-driven economies, such a s Japan, can benefit by stability and predictability, resulting in cheap imports fo r the United States and increased export growth for Japanese industry. Pegged exchange rates facilitated postwar reconstruc tion of U.S. allies during the Cold War, and the United States and its allies therefore bene fited politically, militarily, and economically relative to the Communist threat. However, artificial manipula tion of currency exchange represents an artificial manipulation of free trade, which can threaten the survival of dome stic industry. Nominal and Real Exchange Rates E-26. International finance also distinguishes between nominal and real exchan ge rates. The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which an organization can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another. The real exchange rate is an economic theory that attempts to reflect th e complexity of currencies’ and price levels’ real value. In practical usage, ther e are many foreign currencies and price level values to take into consideration. For example, if the price of a product increases 10 percent in the UK and the Japanese currency simultaneously appr eciates 10 percent against the UK currency, the price of the product remains constant for someone in Japan. The people in the UK, howeve r, would still have to deal with the 10 percent increase in domestic prices. E-27. Government-enacted tariffs or legal restrictions can affect the actual rate of exchange for protectionist economic or other political reasons. For ex ample, if the Thai baht is more valuable than the Bangladeshi rupiah but Bangladesh makes direct tradin g in Baht illegal, the transaction costs of converting each currency into dollars or yen first make s the real exchange rate more costly. E-28. Finally, considerations of nominal and real curr ency values must accoun t for purchasing power parity. If a state’s currency is relatively weaker than an other state’s currency but the cost of living in the former state is also lower, the nomin al exchange rate does not necessarily reflect real value. For example, the CNY may be weaker than the USD if used to buy rice in Tokyo, but le ss yuan is needed to buy that same amount of rice within China. Fluctuations in Exchange Rates E-29. A market-based exchange rate will change whenever the values o f either of the two component currencies change. A currency will tend to become mo re valuable whenever demand for it is greater than the available supply. It will become less valuable when ever demand is less than available supply. This does not mean people no longer want money; it just means th ey prefer holding their w ealth in some other form, possibly another currency. Increased demand for a curre ncy is due to either an increased transaction demand for money or an increased speculative demand for money. E-30. The transaction demand for money is highly correla ted to the country’s level of business activity, GDP, and employment levels. The greater the unemployment, the less the public as a whole will spend on goods and services. Central banks routinely adjust the available mone y supply to accommodate changes in"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Appendix E E-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 the demand for money because of business transactions. The speculative dema nd for money is much harder for a central bank to accommodate but they tr y to do this by adjusting interest rates. E-31. In choosing what type of asset to hold, people are also concerned that the asset will retain its value in the future. Most people will not be interested in a currency if they think it w ill devalue. A currency will tend to lose value, relative to other currencies, if the country’s level of infl ation is relatively higher, if the country’s level of output is expected to decline, or if a country is troubled by political uncertainty. For example, when Russian President Putin dismissed his government on 24 Febr uary 2004, the price of the ruble dropped. Foreign Exchange Markets E-32. Because the world’s main intern ational banks provide a market around-the-clock, the foreign exchange markets are highly liquid. The biggest foreign exchange trading center is London, followed by New York and Tokyo. Foreign Investment E-33. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a long-term investment by a foreign direct invest or in an enterprise residing in an economy not his own. The FDI relationship consis ts of a parent enterprise and a foreign affiliate that together form a TNC. To qualif y as an FDI, the investment must afford the parent enterprise control over its foreign affiliate. The UN de fines control in this case as owning 10 percent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated firm or its eq uivalent for an unincorporated firm. There are several recognized types of FDI: Greenfield investments are direct investment in new facil ities or the expansion of existing facilities . Greenfield investments are the primary targ et of an HN’s promo tional efforts because they create new production capacity and jobs, transfer technology and know-how, and lead to linkages to the global marketplace. However, Greenfield investments often accomplish thi s by crowding out local indu stry. MNCs are able to produce goods more cheaply because of advanced technology and efficient processes. In addition, they compete for local resources (labor, intermediate goods, and so on). Another downside of Greenfiel d investments is that profits from production feed back into the MNC’s home economy instead of th e local economy. This is in contrast to local industries whose profits flow back into the dome stic economy to promote growth. Mergers and acquisitions transfer existing assets from local firms to foreign firms . These are the most common types of FDIs. Cross-border mergers occur when the assets and o peration of firms from different countries combine to establish a new legal entity. Cross-border acquisitions occur when the control of assets and operations transf er from a local to a fore ign company, with the local company becoming an affiliate of the foreign company. E-34. Unlike Greenfield investments, acquisitions provide no long-term benefits to the local economy. In such deals, the acquiring entity typically pays owners of the local firm in stock, m eaning that the money from the sale never reaches the local economy. Ne vertheless, mergers and acquisitions are a significant form of FDI and until the late 1990s accounted for nearly 90 percent of t he FDI flow into the United States. E-35. FDI can be characterized by structure: Horizontal FDI represents investments in the same industry abroad as a firm operates in at home. Vertical FDI takes two forms: When an industry abroad provides inputs for a firm’s domestic production process, it is a backward vertical FDI. When an industry abroad sells the outputs of a firm’s domestic productio n, it is a forward vertical FDI. E-36. The motives of the investing fi rm can also characterize FDI: Resource-seeking investments attempt to acquire mo re efficient production factors than those in the firm’s home economy. In some cases, these resources may not exist in the home economy"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Financial Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 E-7 (for example, cheap labor or scarce natural resources). This typifies FDI into devel oping countries. Market-seeking investments attempt to either penetrate new marke ts or maintain existing ones. Efficiency-seeking investments attempt to exploit the bene fits of economies of scale and scope and also those of common ownership. I NTERNATIONAL F INANCIAL O RGANIZATIONS E-37. The following paragraphs discuss various interna tional financial organizations. These paragraphs will cover the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organiza tion for Economic Coordination and Development, the Bank for International Settlements, and addition al types of international banks and financial institutions. World Bank E-38. The WB is a group of five international organizations responsible for provid ing finance and advice to countries for the purposes of economic development and poverty elimination. The bank came into formal existence in 1945 following international ratification of the Bretton Woods agreemen ts. It approved its first loan on 9 May 1947 ($250 million to France for postwar reconstruction), which in real terms is the largest loan ever issued by the bank. Its five agencies are the— International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). International Finance Corporation (IFC). International Development Association (IDA). Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. E-39. The WB focuses its activities in developing countries on fields, such as human development (for example, education or health), agri culture and rural development (for exam ple, irrigation or rural services), environmental protection (for example, pollution reduction or establishing and en forcing regulations), infrastructure (for example, roads, urban regeneration, or electricity), and governance ( for example, anticorruption or legal institutions development). E-40. The IBRD and IDA provide loans at preferential rates to member countr ies, as well as grants to the poorest countries. Th e granting agency often links loans or gran ts for specific projects to wider policy changes in the sector or the economy. For example, the entity grant ing the loan may link a loan to improve coastal environmental management to the development of new env ironmental institutions at national and local levels and to the implementation of new regulations to limit p ollution. The activities of the IFC and MIGA include investment in the private s ector and providing insurance respectively. E-41. The WB is an international organization owned by member governments. The headqua rters of the WB is in Washington, DC. Although it makes profits, th e WB uses profits to support continued efforts in poverty reduction. The WB technically is part of the UN system, but its governance s tructure is different. Each institution in the WB group is owned by its memb er governments, which subscribe to its basic share capital with votes proportional to shareholding. Member ship gives certain voting rights that are the same for all countries but there are also additional votes that depend on fina ncial contributions to the organization. E-42. As a result, developed countries primarily control the WB. Most of the WB’s clie nts are developing countries. Some critics argue that a different governance structure would ta ke greater account of developing countries’ needs. As of 2006, the United States held 16.4 percent of total votes; Japan, 7.9 percent; Germany, 4.5 percent; and the UK and France each held 4.3 percent. As major decisions require an 85 percent super majority, the United States can block any major changes. International Monetary Fund E-43. The IMF is an international organization that oversees the global financial sys tem by observing exchange rates and balance of payments, as well as offering financial and technical assistance when"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Appendix E E-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 requested. The IMF’s headquarters is in Washington, DC. However, the IM F describes itself as an organization of 185 countries working to foster global monetary cooperati on, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sust ainable economic growth, and reduce poverty. E-44. The primary mission of the IMF is to provide financ ial assistance to countries that experience serious financial difficulties. Member states with balance-of-payment probl ems may request loans or organizational management of their national economies. In retu rn, the countries are usually required to launch certain reforms. Critics have often derisively dubbed the reforms as the “Washington consensus.” The IMF generally requires these reforms because count ries with fixed exchange rate policies can engage in fiscal, monetary, and political practices that may l ead to the crisis. For example, states with severe budget deficits, rampant inflation, strict price controls, or significantly ove rvalued or undervalued currencies run the risk of facing balance-of-payment crises in the future. Thus, the IMF’s structural adjustment programs ostensibly attempt to ensure that the IMF is actually helping to prevent financial crises rather than merely funding financial recklessness. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development E-45. The OECD is an international organization of de veloped countries that accept the principles of representative democracy and a free market economy. It originat ed in 1948 to help administer the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after WWII. La ter, however, the OECD extended its membership to non-European states. E-46. The OECD Secretariat in Paris provides a setting for governments to compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, and identify good practice and coordinate do mestic and international policies. It is a forum where peer pressure can act as a powerful incentive to improve policy and implement “soft law”—nonbinding instruments that can occasiona lly lead to binding treaties. The Secretariat collects data, monitors trends and analyses, and forecasts econom ic developments. It also researches social changes or evolving patterns in trade, environment, agriculture, technology, taxation, and other ar eas. The OECD is also a premium statistical agency, because it publishes highly comp arable statistics on a wide number of subjects. E-47. Over the past decade, the OECD has tackled a range of economic, social, an d environmental issues while deepening its engagement with businesses, trade unions, and other repre sentatives of civil society. Activities have included negotiating taxation and transf er pricing, coordinating international action on corruption and bribery, and reporting on the effects of Internet spam problems in developing countries. Twenty-four nonmembers currently participate as regular observers or full participants in OECD committees, and the OECD conducts policy dialogues and capacity bui lding activities with nonmembers (country programs, regional approaches, and global forums) to share bes t policy practices. Bank for International Settlements E-48. The BIS is an international organization of central banks that exists to foste r cooperation among central banks and other agencies in pursuit of monetary and financial stability. It carries out its work through subcommittees, the secretariats it hosts, and through its annual general meeting of all members. The BIS also provides banking services, but only to central banks or to o ther international financial organizations. The headquarters of the BIS is in Basel, Switzerland. E-49. As an organization of central banks, the BIS seek s to increase predictability and transparency in monetary policy among its 55 member central banks. While monetary policy is determ ined by each sovereign state, policy is subject to central and private banking scru tiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and the fate of export economies. Failures to ke ep monetary policy in line with reality and to make timely monetary refo rms—preferably as a simultaneous policy among all 55 member banks and the IMF—have historically led to fi nancial losses in the billions of dollars as banks try to maintain a policy using open market methods that have proven to be unrealistic. E-50. Central banks do not unilaterally “set” exchange rates; they set go als and intervene using their massive financial resources and regulatory powers to ach ieve monetary targets that they set. One reason to coordinate policy closely at the BIS and elsewhere is to ensure that this does not become too expensive and"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Financial Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 E-9 that opportunities for private arbitrage exploiting shifts in policy or difference in policy are rare and quickly removed. The BIS therefore has two specific goals: to regulate capital adequacy and to make reserve requirements transparent. Additional Bank and Financial Institution Types E-51. A multilateral development bank (MDB) is an institution created by a group of states that provides financing and professional advice for development. MDBs have large membershi ps including both developed donor countries and developing borrower countries. MDBs finance proj ects in the form of long-term loans at market rates, very long-term lo ans (also known as credits) below market rates, and through grants. The five main MDBs are the WB, African Development B ank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-American De velopment Bank Group. E-52. There are also several “subregional” MDBs. These banks typically only include borrowing nations as members and do not include developed donor nations. The banks borrow from a nd lend to its developing members. Examples include the Caribbean Development Bank and the West A frican Development Bank. E-53. There are also several multilateral financial institu tions. These institutions are similar to MDBs but they are sometimes separated because their memberships are more limited and their financing often focuses on financing certain types of projects. Examples include the European Investment Ba nk, the Islamic Development Bank, and the OPEC Fund for International Development. INSTRUMENTS OF UNITED ST ATES FINANCIAL POWER E-54. The Department of the Treasury is the primary federal agency responsible for the economic and financial prosperity and security of the United St ates. As such, the Department of the Treasure is responsible for a wide range of activities, including advising the Presid ent on economic and financial issues, promoting the President’s growth agenda, and enhancing corporate gove rnance in financial institutions. In the international arena, the Treasury works with other fede ral agencies, the governments of other nations, and the international financial institutions to e ncourage economic growth, raise standards of living, and predict and prevent, to the exte nt possible, economic and financial crises. E-55. The basic functions of the Treasury include— Managing federal finances. Collecting taxes, duties, and monies paid to and because of the Uni ted States. Paying all bills of the United States. Producing all postage stamps , currency, and coinage. Managing government accounts and the U.S. public debt. Supervising national banks and thrift institutions. Enforcing federal finance and tax laws. Advising the President and Congress on domes tic and international financial, monetary, economic, trade, and tax policy. Investigating and prosecuting tax evaders, c ounterfeiters, forgers, smugglers, illicit spirits distillers, and gun law violators. E-56. Various offices and bureaus exist within the Treasur y that support USG power abroad and, in some cases, function as U.S. financial “weapons.” The Treasury includes 10 offices, among which is International Affairs. The mission of International Affa irs is to protect and support economic prosperity at home by encouraging financial stability and sound economic policies abroad. International Affairs performs constant surveillance and in-depth analysis of global econo mic and financial developments and then engages with financial market participants, foreign governmen ts, international financial institutions, and in multilateral meetings to develop and promote good polic ies. It advises and assists in the formulation and execution of U.S. international economic and fina ncial policy, as well as international financial, economic, monetary, trade, investment, bilateral aid, environment, debt, develo pment, and energy programs, including U.S. participation in international financial institutions."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Appendix E E-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 E-57. Another Treasury office is Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI). TFI marshals the department’s intelligence and enforcement functions with the twin aims of safeguard ing the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue nations, terrorist facilitators, mone y launderers, drug kingpins, and other national security threats. TFI develops and implements USG strategies to comb at terrorist financing domestically and internationally, develops and implements the nat ional money-laundering strategy, as well as other policies and programs to fight financial crimes. E-58. TFI gathers and analyzes information from the intelligence, law enforcement, and financial communities concerning how terrorists and other criminals earn, move, an d store money. Based on this analysis, TFI takes appropriate policy, regulatory, or enforcement action to— Freeze the assets of terrorists, drug kingpins, and their support networks. Cut off corrupt foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions from the U.S . financial system. Develop and enforce regulations to address U.S. vulnerabilities to terrorist financing and money laundering. Promote the international adoption and implementation of counterterrorist financi ng and anti-money-laundering standards. Trace and repatriate assets looted by corrupt foreign offi cials in such countries as Iraq, Liberia, and Haiti. Promote a meaningful exchange of information with the private financial sect or to detect and address threats to the financial system. E-59. TFI’s subordinate offices include an Office of Terr orist Finance and Financial Crime, an Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA), an d an OFAC. TFI is also affiliated with the Treasury bureau FinCEN. E-60. OIA is responsible for the receipt, analysis, collation, and disseminat ion of foreign intelligence and foreign CI information related to the operation and responsibilities of the Tre asury. OIA is a member of the U.S. IC. Its mission is to support the formulation of policy and execution of treasury authorities by providing— Expert analysis and intelligence production on financial and othe r support networks for terrorist groups, proliferators, and other key national security threats. Timely, accurate, and focused in telligence support on the full range of eco nomic, political, and security issues. E-61. OFAC administers and en forces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries , terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those engaged in activities related to the proliferati on of WMD. OFAC acts under Presidential wartime and national emergency powers, as well as authority granted by specific legisl ation, to impose controls on transactions and to freeze foreign assets under U.S. jurisdiction. UN and other international mandates are the basis for many of the sanctions, which are multilateral in scop e and involve close cooperation with allied governments. E-62. The Treasury has a long history of dealing with sanctions dating back to bef ore the War of 1812 when it administered sanctions imposed against Great Britain for the harassment of American sailors. During the Civil War, Congress approved a law that prohibited transactions w ith the Confederacy, called for the forfeiture of goods involved in such transactions, and provided a l icensing regime under rules and regulations administered by the Treasury. E-63. OFAC is the successor to the Office of Foreign Funds Control (FFC), which was established in WWII following the German invasion of Norway in 19 40. The Secretary of the Treasury administered the FFC program throughout the war. The FFC’s initial pu rpose was to prevent Nazi use of the occupied countries’ holdings of foreign exchange and securities and to prevent forced repatriation of funds belonging to nationals of those countries. The United States later extended these cont rols to protect assets of other invaded countries. After the United States formally entered WWII, the FFC played a leading role in economic warfare against the Axis powers by blocking enemy assets and pro hibiting foreign trade and financial transactions. The Treasury formally created OF AC in 1950, following the entry of China into the Korean War. OFAC blocked all Chinese and North Korean assets subje ct to U.S. jurisdiction."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Financial Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 E-11 E-64. The Treasury also includes 11 bureaus, among which is the FinCEN. The FinCEN sup ports law enforcement investigative efforts and fosters interagency and global cooper ation against domestic and international financial crimes. It also provides U.S. policy makers with strategic analyses of domestic and worldwide trends and patterns. E-65. Since 1995, the United States has pursued an aggressive policy of promoti ng a worldwide network of financial intelligence units (FIUs) in its overall strategy of fight ing money laundering and terrorist financing. The FinCEN is the FIU of the United States . As such, the FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group of FIU. The Egmont group is an international network of 100 countr ies that have implemented national centers to collect information on suspicious or unusual fi nancial activity from the financial industry, to analyze the data, and to make it available to appropriate nat ional authorities and other financial intelligence units for use in combating terrorist funding and other fina ncial crimes. E-66. Information exchange is at the heart of the Eg mont group. There are limitations, however. All information exchanged by an FIU is subject to strict controls and safeguards t o ensure that its use is in an authorized manner consistent with national provisions on priva cy and data protection. No entity can use the information in an administrative, investigative, prosecutorial, or judicial purpose without the prior consent of the FIU that disclosed the information. E-67. The FinCEN also provides strategic analysis support to internationa l law enforcement through identification of trends, patterns, and issues associated with money laun dering and other financial crimes. Strategic analysis information, especially suspici ous activity reports filed by the nation’s financial industries, forms the heart of FinC EN’s strategic analysis knowledge base. FinCEN’s strategic analysis products are intended to assist partners in the improvement of money-laundering pre vention and detection programs while providing support for the enforcement of anti-money-laun dering laws and regulations. E-68. The objectives of strategic an alysis at the FinCEN include— Disseminating information on money-laundering trends and methods to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the banking industry. Assessing industry, geographic, and other systemic money-laundering vu lnerabilities. Undertaking research and analysis to identif y newly emerging or inadequately understood money-laundering methodologies. Providing support to federal, state, local, and in ternational law enforcement efforts in connection with illicit funds movement methodologies associated with co mplex financial or money-laundering investigations. Providing feedback to the U.S. financial community on the use and utili ty of suspicious activity reports and other Bank Secrecy Act data.

The INTERPOL is the world’s largest international police organization, with 186 member countries. Created in 1923, it facilitates cross-border police coop eration and supports and assists all organizations, authorities, and services whose mission is to prevent or combat international crime. The INTERPOL aims to facilitate international police cooperation even where diplomatic relations do not exist between particular countries. Action is taken within the limits of existi ng laws in different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Ri ghts. INTERPOL’s constitution prohibits “any intervention or a ctivities of a political, military, religious, or racial charact er.” The INTERPOL has three core functions, which provide— Secure global police communications. Data services and databases for police. Operational police support services. S ECURE G LOBAL P OLICE C OMMUNICATIONS S ERVICES F-2. The ability of police to exchange crucial data quic kly and securely is a cornerstone of effective international law enforcement. This is why INTERPOL developed the I-24/7 global police communications system. The system connects the INTERPOL General Secretariat in Lyon, France, with the National Central Bureaus (NCBs) in member countries and regional offices, creati ng a global network for the exchange of police information and providing law enforcement authorit ies in member countries with instant access to the organization’s databases and other services. F-3. Member countries can also choose to grant consultative access to authorized law enforcement entities outside of NCBs, such as border control units or customs officials. INTERPOL continues to develop new services and training programs to ensu re that users are able to make full use of the I-24/7 system. As of the end of 2006, 183 countries and 25 additional sites, including INTERPOL Sub-Regional Bureaus, were connected. For coun tries unable to connect because of technical or financial limitations, a sophisticated, cost-efficient satellite system is in place to enable a ll member countries to be active participants of the international law enforcement community. O PERATIONAL D ATA S ERVICES AND D ATABASES FOR P OLICE F-4. To fight international crime, po lice need access to information that can assist investigations or prevent crime. INTERPOL manages several databases, accessible to the INTERPOL bureaus in all member countries through its I-24/7 communications system, which contain criti cal information on criminals and criminality. These include— MIND/FIND. Suspected terrorists. Nominal data on criminals (names, photos). Fingerprints. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiles. Lost or stolen travel documents. Child sexual abuse images. Stolen works of art. Stolen motor vehicles."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Appendix F F-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 O PERATIONAL P OLICE S UPPORT S ERVICES F-5. INTERPOL seeks to enhance the role of NCBs and regional offices and to increase the General Secretariat’s responsiveness to th eir needs. This includes the development of emergency support and operational activities centered on the organization’s pr iority crime areas: fugitives, public safety and terrorism, drugs and organized crime, trafficking in human beings, and financial and high-tech c rime. The Command and Coordination Centre (CCC) operates around the clock in all of INTERPOL’s four official languages (English, French, Spanish, and Arabic) and serves as the first poi nt of contact for any member country faced with a crisis. The CCC staff monitors news channels and INTERPOL messages exchanged between member countries to ensure the full reso urces of the organization are ready and available whenever and wherever needed. If a terrorist attack or natural disaster occurs, the CCC and the Crisis Support Group mobilize to offer and coordinate the organization’s response . INTERPOL treats all messages and requests for information and assistance fr om the affected member co untries with the highest priority. F-6. Terrorism poses a grave threat to individuals’ lives and nat ional security around the world. INTERPOL has therefore made available various training and resources to support member countries in their efforts to protect their citizen s from terrorism, including bioterrorism, firearms and explosives, attacks against civil aviation, maritime piracy, and WMD. F-7. INTERPOL collects, stores, analyzes, and exchanges information about sus pected individuals and groups and their activities. The organization also coor dinates the circulation of alerts and warnings on terrorists, dangerous criminals, and weapons threats to police in member countries. A chief initiative in this area is the Fusion Task Force, which INTERPOL created in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks in the United States. F-8. INTERPOL has long cooperated with the UN in law enforcement matters and has observer status in the General Assembly. This cooperation includes— Responding to the needs of the international community in fighting crime. Assisting states in their effort s to combat organized crime. Cooperating in the implementation of the mandates of internationa l judicial bodies. Carrying out joint investigations and other police-related matters in the context of peacekeeping. Establishing joint databases related to penal law. INSTRUMENTS OF UNITED ST ATES LAW ENFORCEMENT F-9. The following paragraphs discuss the instrument s of U.S. law enforcement. Most of these instruments reside within the Department of Justi ce, although there are si gnificant agencies in the Departments of Homeland Security and State as well. D EPARTMENT OF J USTICE F-10. The mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law, to ensure public sa fety against threats foreign and domestic, to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime, to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior, and to ensure fair and impartial administrati on of justice for all Americans. The attorney general represents the United States in legal matters a nd advises the President and heads of the executive departments of the government when so requested. The DOJ is the world’s large st law office and the central agency for enforcement of federal laws. F-11. Among its other offices, the DOJ includes a National Security Division that combines the CT and counterespionage sections of the Criminal Division with the Fo reign Intelligence Surveillance Act experts from the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIP R). This organization enables a vigorous effort to combat terrorism and other threats to national security. The National Security Division improves coordination against terrorism between the DOJ, CIA, DOD, and other IC agen cies."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Law Enforcement Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 F-3 F-12. The DOJ also has several subordinate elements that function as part of the U.S. law enforcement instrument of national power abroad, including the United States Nat ional Central Bureau (USNCB) of INTERPOL, the FBI, and the DEA. United States National Central Bureau of INTERPOL F-13. The USNCB operates in conjunction with the DHS and within the guide lines pr escribed by the DOJ. The mission of the USNCB is to facilitate international law enforcem ent cooperation as the U.S. representative with INTERPOL on behalf of the attorney general. The major functions of the USNCB are to— Transmit information of a criminal justice, humanitarian, or other law enforcement-related nature between NCBs of INTERPOL member coun tries and law enforcement agencies of the United States. Respond to requests by law enforcement agencies and legitimate orga nizations, institutions, and individuals when in agreement with the INTERPOL constitution. Coordinate and integrate information for investig ations of an international nature and identify those involving patterns and trends of criminal activities. Federal Bureau of Investigation F-14. The FBI has an international presence to protect Americans. The globalization of crime—whether terrorism; international trafficking of drugs, contra band, and people; or cybercrime—requires the United States to integrate law enforcement efforts with willi ng international partners. This integration includes having FBI agents work directly with law enforcemen t counterparts ab road, where possibl e, to solve and prevent crimes and terrorism. The FBI’s international presence currently consists of more than 50 small legal attaché offices in U.S. Embassies and consulat es around the world. Thei r goals include stopping foreign crime as far from American shores as possible and helping solve international crimes that do occur as quickly as possible. The activities of agents and support staff in clude coordinating international investigations with their colleagues, covering intern ational leads for domestic U.S. investigations, and linking U.S. and international resources in critical crim inal and terrorist areas that better ensure the safety of the American public at home and abroad. F-15. The FBI solicits information on suspected criminal and terrorist activity, including possible terrorist threats to the United States. The FBI’s CI section is responsible for exposing, preventing, and investigating intelligence activities on U.S. soil. The FBI is the lead law enforcement agency for investigating cyber-based attacks by foreign adversaries and terror ists. The FBI works with the DOJ’s National Security Division, which consolidates the resources of the Criminal Division’s CT and counterespionage sections and the OIPR. The Criminal Division supervises the investigation an d prosecution of cases affecting national security, exercises the exclusive responsibility for authorizing the prosecution of criminal cases relating to espionage and sabotage, and plays a key role in coordinating U.S. efforts t o combat and disrupt terrorist activity against U.S. interests around the world. Drug Enforcement Administration F-16. Another arm of the U.S. law enfor cement instrument abroad is the foreign cooperative investigations and corollary activities of the DEA. Cooperation with fo reign law enforcement agencies is essential to the DEA mission because the trafficking syndicates responsi ble for the drug trade inside the United States do not operate solely within U.S. bord ers. Since its creation in 1973, the number of DEA agents stationed i n foreign countries has grown as drug syndicates possess greater financial and technol ogical resources that enable them to operate on a global scale. International cooperation has increasingly become more crucial to effective drug law enforcement. By 2002, the DEA was operating in 58 foreign countries. F-17. In 1976, the Mansfield Amendment required the US G to adopt formal rules concerning DEA agents’ duties and activities while working abroad. Among the am endment’s many restrictions, DEA agents were prohibited from active involvement in arrests of suspects in host countries. T hey were also prohibited from participating in unilateral enforcement actions without t he approval of officials fr om the host government."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Appendix F F-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Operating strictly within these guidelines, DEA agen ts participate in five different law enforcement functions while working abroad: Bilateral investigations . DEA special agents assist their foreign counterparts by developing sources of information and interviewing witne sses. Agents work undercover and assist in surveillance efforts on cases that involve drug traffic affecting the U nited States. Foreign liaison . The DEA actively participates in several international forums to p romote international law enforcement cooperation. Institution building . The DEA helps host countries fight the criminals by working with the people who have the integrity and the courage to pass strong antidrug laws and bu ild strong law enforcement institutions. Intelligence gathering . The DEA, respected for its drug intelligence-gathering abilities, su pports its foreign counterparts’ investigations by provid ing information, such as who controls the drug trade; how drugs are distributed; how the profits are being laundered; and how the entire worldwide drug system operates at the source le vel, transportation level, and wholesale and retail levels. International training . The DEA conducts training for host- country police agen cies at the DEA training facilities in Quantico, Virginia, and on-site in host coun tries.

It also plays a role at select times and locations in foreign waters. In an environme nt shaped by globally interlinked economies, revolutions in maritime transportation and information systems, emerging threats to the marine en vironment, and changing national security concerns, the USG has an abiding interest in continuing the USCG’s active presence and e xertion of influence in the nation’s inland waters, coastal regions, and on the high seas. F-20. The fundamental roles of the USCG are to save lives and property at sea; provide a safe, efficient marine transportation system; protect the marine en vironment; enforce laws and treaties in the maritime region; and defend U.S. national security interests and maritime borders in Americ a’s inland waterways, ports and harbors, and along the approximately 95,000 miles of U.S. coas tlines. The USCG also defends U.S. interests in U.S. territorial seas, the more th an 3.4 million square miles of U.S. exclusive economic zones, in international waters, and in other maritime regions of importance to the United States. The USCG has unique characteristics as a mar itime agency with regulatory authority, law enforcement authority, and military capability.

Under the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. President is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. To coordinate military action with diplomatic action, the President has a n advisory NSC headed by a National Security Advisor. Under the Presiden t is the SecDef, a cabinet secretary responsible for the DOD. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is made up of the Service chiefs and is led by the CJCS a nd the Vice Chairman of the JCS. The JCS advises both the President and SecDef. The Goldwater-Nichols Act streamlined the military chain of command, which now runs from the President through the SecDef direc tly to unified CCDRs, bypassing the JCS, who were assigned to an advisory role. Each Service is respon sible for organizing, training, and equipping military units for the commanders of the various un ified commands. G-2. There are 10 unified COCOMs—6 geographic and 4 functional. These commands and their responsibilities are as follows: U.S. Northern Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado (responsible for North America n homeland defense and coordinating homela nd security with civilian forces). U.S. Central Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida (responsible for E gypt through the Persian Gulf region and into Central Asia). U.S. European Command (also Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe), Belgium and Stuttgart, Germany (responsible for Europe and Israel). U.S. Pacific Command, Camp H. M. Smith, Oahu, Hawaii (responsible for the A sia-Pacific region including Hawaii). U.S. Southern Command, Miami, FL (responsible for South and Central America a nd the surrounding waters). U.S. Africa Command, Stuttgart, Germany presently but relocation to the African continent is planned (responsible for Africa excluding Egypt). USSOCOM, MacDill Air Force Base, FL (responsib le for providing special operations for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps). U.S. Joint Forces Command (also Suprem e Allied Commander Transformation and Naval Support Activity Headquarters) Norfolk, Virginia (responsible for support ing other commands as a joint force provider). U.S. Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Ba se, Nebraska (responsible for the strategic deterrent force and coordinating the use of space assets). U.S. Transportation Command, Scott Air Force Ba se, Illinois (responsible for global mobility of all military assets for all regional commands). G-3. The armed forces fulfill unique and crucial roles, defending the United States against all adversaries and serving the nation as a bulwark and guarantor of its security and independence. When called to action, they support and defend national interests worldwide. They fulfill their roles, missions, and functions within the American system of civil-military relations . The interests of the United States and the nature of the challenges it faces demand that the armed forces operate as a fully integrat ed joint team across the range of military operations. U.S. forces may conduct th ese operations with the military forces of allies and coalition partners, U.S. and foreign government agenci es, state and local government agencies, IGOs, and NGOs. The best way to meet today’s challenges is th rough the unified action of the armed forces eliciting the maximum contribution from each Service and th eir unique but complement ary capabilities and through the synergy that results from their synchronized and integrated action."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Appendix G G-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 JOINT FORCE G-4. The term “unified action” is a broad generic term th at describes the wide scope of actions directed by national civilian and military authorities and the commanders of unified commands, subordinate unified commands, or JTFs. It includes the synchronization and integration of joint or multinational military operations with the activities of local, state, and federal governmen t agencies; IGOs; and NGOs. “Unity of effort” is the result of su ccessful unified action. National unified action is governed by the constitution, federal law, international law, and the national interest. Responsibilities for strategic coordination established by the Constitution and federal law and practice are as follow s: The President of the United States, advised by th e NSC, is responsible to the American people for national strategic unified action. The SecDef is responsible to the President fo r creating, supporting, and employing military capabilities. The SecDef provides authoritativ e direction and control over the Military Departments through the Service secretaries. The SecDef retains control of and authority over those logistics and logistics support forces not specifically assigned to the COCOMs and administers this authority through the Military Departments, the Service secretaries, and applicable chains of command. The Military Depa rtments organize, train, and equip forces for combat and provide for the administration and support of those forces assigned or attached to the CCDRs. The CJCS is the principal military advisor to th e President, the NSC, and the SecDef. The CJCS functions under the authority of the President and the direction and control of the President and SecDef. The CJCS transmits communications be tween the President, SecDef, and CCDRs and oversees activities of CCDRs as directed by the SecDef. CCDRS exercise COCOM over assi gned forces. They are respon sible to the President and SecDef for the performance of assigned missions and the preparedness of their commands to perform assigned missions. In a foreign country, the U.S. Ambassador is responsible to the President for directing, coordinating, and supervising all USG elements in the HN, except those under the command of a CCDR. GCCs are responsible for coordinating with U.S. Ambassadors in their geographic AORs as necessary across the range of military operations and for negoti ating memoranda of agreement with the Chiefs of Mission in designate d countries in support of military operations. Force protection is an example of a military operation or requiremen t where a memorandum of agreement would enhance coor dination and integration. G-5. Unified action within joint commands synchroni zes and integrates join t, single-service, and multinational operations with the operations of other USG agencies , NGOs, and IGOs (for example, the UN) to achieve unity of effort in the operational ar ea. Unified action within the military instrument of national power supports the national strategic unified action through close coordination with the other instruments of national power. Success depends on unified actions. T he CJCS and all CCDRs are in pivotal positions to ensure that unified actions are planned and conducted IAW the guidance and direction received from the President and SecDef ICW other authorities (for example, alliance or coalition leadership). G-6. Unified action of the U.S. armed forces starts with unified direction. For U.S. military operations, unified direction is normally accomplished by esta blishing a joint force, a ssigning a mission to the designated JFC, establishing command relationships, assigning or attaching app ropriate Service and special operations forces to the joint force, and empowering the JFC with sufficient authority over the forces to accomplish the assigned mission. O BJECTIVES G-7. In the abstract sense, an objective is the clearly defined, decisive, and attainable goal toward which every military operation should be directed—the mi litary objective. Objectiv es provide the focus for military action; they are essential for unity of effort. In the concret e sense, an objective may be a physical object of the action taken (for example, a definite terrain feature, the se izure or holding of which is essential to the commander’s plan or the destruction of an a dversarial force without regard to terrain features). This is more accurately termed the “physical objective.” Soldiers mu st not confuse physical"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Military Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 G-3 objectives with military objectives, although occasionally they m ay overlap. Usually, physical objectives contribute to the attainment of military objectives. Military o bjectives must contribute to the achievement of national objectives (for example, defend the territorial integrity of an ally, ensure the freedom of maritime commerce, and so on.). R OLES , M ISSIONS , AND F UNCTIONS G-8. The terms “roles, missions, and functions” are often used interchangeably, but the distinctions between them are important: Role : A role is a position or function. This is the broad term for which the s ervices and USSOCOM were established in law. Mission : The mission is the task, together with the purpose, that clearly in dicates the action to be taken and the reason therefore. In common usage, and especially when applied to lower military units, a mission is a duty assigned to an individual or unit. The mission i s a task. Functions : Functions are the appropriate or assigned du ties, responsibilities, missions, or tasks of an individual, office, or organization. As defined in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, the term “function” includes functions, powers, and duties. C HAIN OF C OMMAND G-9. The President and SecDef exercise authority and control of the armed forces through two distinct branches of the chain of command. One branch runs from the President through the SecDef to the commanders of unified commands for missions and fo rces assigned to their commands. The other branch (used for purposes other than operational direction of forces assigned to the COCOMs) runs from the President through the SecDef to th e secretaries of the Military Departments. The Military Departments, organized separately, operate under the authority, direction, and control of the SecDef . The secretaries of the Military Departments exercise authority through th eir respective Service chiefs over their forces not assigned to the CCDRs. The Service chiefs, except as otherwise prescribed by law, perform their duties under the authority, direction, and cont rol of the secretaries. The Service chiefs are directly responsible to their secretaries. G-10. CCDRs exercise COCOM of assigned forces. They are directly responsible to the President and SecDef for the performance of assigned missions and the preparedness of the ir commands. CCDRs prescribe the chain of command within their COCO Ms and designate the appropriate command authority that subordinate comm anders can exercise. G-11. The Military Departments operate under the authority , direction, and control of the SecDef. This branch of the chain of command is responsible for a ll military forces within the respective Service not assigned to commanders of COCOMs. For those forces not assigned to COCOMs, th e Service secretary has authorities and responsibilities equal to COCOM (command authority) a nd administers these through the appropriate chain of command. This branch is separa te and distinct from the branch of the chain of command that exists within a COCOM. C OMBATANT C OMMANDS G-12. The President, through the SecDef and with the advice and assistance of the CJCS, establishes combatant (unified or specified) co mmands for the performance of military missions and prescribes the force structure of such commands. The CJCS assist s the President and SecDef in performing their command functions. The CJCS transmits to the CCDRs the orders given by the P resident or SecDef and, as directed by the SecDef, oversees the activities of those commands. Orders issued by the President or SecDef are normally conveyed by the CJCS under the authority and directio n of the SecDef. CCDRs normally submit reports through the CJCS. The CJCS w ill then forward them to the SecDef and will act as the spokesman for the CCDRs. G-13. Commanders in the chain of command exercise COCOM, OPCON, TACON, or a support command relationship, as prescribed by law or a superior commander, over the m ilitary capability made available to them. Unless otherwise directed by the President or SecDef, COCOM is reserved for the commanders of"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Appendix G G-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 the COCOMs over forces assigned to that command. For those forces no t assigned to COCOMs the Service secretary has authorities and responsibilities equal to COCOM (command authority) and administers these through the appropriate chain of command. During contingency planning, th e majority of forces are apportioned to support the missions of more than one CCDR. This requires CCDRs that do not exercise COCOM over an apportione d force to continuously coordinate w ith the CCDR that ex ercises COCOM to fully prepare for mission success. MILITARY DEPARTMENTS, SERVICES, AND FORCES G-14. The authority vested in the secretaries of the Military Departments in the performance of their role to organize, man, train, equip, and provide forces runs from the President th rough the SecDef to the secretaries. Then, to the degree established by the secretari es or specified in law, this authority runs through the Service chiefs to the Service component commanders assigned to the CCD Rs and to the commanders of forces not assigned to the CCDRs. This administrativ e control (ADCON) provides for the preparation of military forces and their administration and support, unless the SecDef specifi cally assigns those responsibilities to another DOD component. G-15. The secretaries of the Military Departments are responsible for the admi nistration and support of the Service forces assigned or attached to CCDRs. They fulfill their responsib ilities by exercising ADCON of Service forces through the Service chiefs (as determ ined by the secretaries) to the commanders of the Service component comma nds assigned to CCDRs. G-16. Each of the secretaries of the Military Departments, coordinating as appropriate with the other department secretaries and with the CCDRs, has th e responsibility for organizing, manning, training, equipping, and providing forces to fulfill specific role s and for administering and supporting these forces. This responsibility, however, is subject to the CCDR’ s authority to organize assigned forces and ensure their preparedness as necessary to accomplish a specific mission. G-17. Commanders of forces are responsible to their re spective Service chiefs for the administration, training, and readiness of their units. Commanders of forces assigned to the COCOMs are under the authority, direction, and control of (and are responsible to) their CCDR to carry out assi gned operational missions, joint training and exercises, and logistics. G-18. The USG manages the USCG differently. Although it is a military Service and a branch of the U.S. armed forces at all times, federal law establishes it separately as a service in the DHS, except when transferred to the DN during time of war or when the President so directs. Authorities vested in the USCG under Title 10 as an armed Service and Title 14 as a federal maritime s afety and law enforcement agency remain in effect at all times, including when US CG forces are operating within the DOD/DN chain of command. USCG commanders and forces may be assign ed to JFCs in performance of any activity for which they are uniquely qualified. USCG units routinely serve alongsid e USN counterparts operating within a naval task organization in support of a maritime component com mander. G-19. In addition to the Services above, a number of defense agencies pr ovide a spectrum of logistics or sustainment to joint forces. The USG designates thes e agencies as combat support agencies (CSAs). Included among CSAs are the DIA, NGA, Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Contract Management Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction Age ncy. These CSAs provide CCDRs with specialized su pport. Executive authority over thes e CSAs resides with the SecDef.

Other key elements of this effec tiveness are the conduct of joint training and exercise, and a materiel development and fielding process that pr ovides materiel that is fully compatible with and complementary to systems of all Services. G-22. A key to successful interoperability is to ensure th at planning processes are joint from their inception. Those responsible for systems and programs intended for joint use est ablish working groups that fully represent the Services and functions affected. Planne rs consider interoperability in all joint program reviews. CCDRs ensure maximum interoperability and identify interoperability issues to the CJCS, who has overall responsibility for the joint interoperability program. G-23. The synchronized employment of land, air, maritime, space, and special operations forces provides JFCs with a wide range of strategi c, operational, and tactical options . All Service components contribute their distinct capabilities to the joint campaign, each domin ating a domain. However, their operational and tactical interdependence is critical to overall joint force effectiveness. Joint interdependence is the purposeful reliance by one Service’s forces on anot her Service’s capabilities to maximize complementary and reinforcing effects of both. J OINT S PECIAL O PERATIONS G-24. USSOCOM is the unified COCOM charged with overseeing the various SO commands of each U.S. military branch. The command is part of the DOD. When SOF of different branches participate in the same operation, USSOCOM acts as the joint command center of all the forces for th e operation. The Joint Special Operations Command is the USSOCOM branch working on CT. AIR AND SPACE POWER G-25. The USAF is the aerospace branch of the armed forces. The USAF is currently the largest and the most technologically advanced air force in the world, with about 6,057 manned a ircraft in service (4,273 USAF, 1,313 Air National Guard, and 400 Air Force Reserve), approximately 160 unma nned combat air vehicles, 2,161 air-launched cruise missiles, and 1, 900 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The stated mission of the USAF today is to “deliver sovereign options for the defense of the United States of America and its global interests—to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.” G-26. The USAF does not operate all U.S. military combat aircraft. The USA operates its own helicopters, mostly for support of ground combatants. The USN is responsible for the a ircraft operating on its aircraft carriers and naval air stations, and the USMC operates its own combat and transport aircraft. The USCG also maintains transport an d search-and-rescue aircraft, which may be used in either a combat or law enforcement role. All branches of th e U.S. military operate helicopters. O RGANIZATION G-27. The (civilian) Department of the Air Force manages and the Secret ary of the Air Force (SECAF) leads the USAF and the uniformed air staff. The o ffice of the SECAF handles acquisition and auditing, comptroller issues (including financial management), inspector general matt ers, legislative affairs, and public affairs. USAF subordinat e commands and echelons are the major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies, and direct reporting units (DRUs). M AJOR C OMMANDS G-28. The USAF is organized on a functional basis in the United States and a geog raphical basis overseas. A MAJCOM represents a major USAF subdivision having a specific portion of the USAF mission. Each MAJCOM is directly subordinate to HQ USAF. MAJC OMs are interrelated and complementary, providing offensive, defensive, and support elements. An operational command consis ts (in whole or in part) of strategic, tactical, space, or defense forces, or of flying forces that di rectly support such forces. A support command may provide supplies, weapon systems, support systems, operational su pport equipment, combat material, maintenance, surface tran sportation, education and training , or special services and other supported organizations."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Appendix G G-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 N UMBERED A IR F ORCES G-29. The numbered air forces (NAFs) are a level of command directly under a MAJCOM. NAFs are tactical echelons that provide operational leadership and supervision. The y are not management HQ. They do not have complete functional staffs. Many NAFs are responsible for MAJCOM operations in a specific geographic region or theater of operations. A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups, and squadrons. Wings G-30. The wing is a level of command below the NAF. It is responsible for maint aining the installation and may have several squadrons in more than one dependent group. A wing may be an operational wing, an air base wing, or a specialized mission wing. A colonel or brigadier general usually commands a wing. Operational Wing G-31. An operational wing is one that has an operations group and related op erational mission activity assigned to it. When an operational wing performs the primary mission of the ba se, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is capable of self-support in functional areas like maintenance, supply, and munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a tenant organization, the host command provides it with base and logistics support. Air Base Wing G-32. Some bases that do not have operational wings or are too large or div erse for one wing will have an air base wing (ABW). The ABW performs a support function rather than an ope rational mission. It maintains and operates a base. An ABW often provides functional support to a M AJCOM HQ. Several groups with different functional responsibilities make up wings. Several squadrons, each of which has one major responsibility of flying one type of aircraft, make up groups. Two or more flig hts make up a squadron. Independent Groups G-33. The last level of independent operation is the group level. When an organizati on is not part of the primary mission of the base, it will be made an independent group. Inde pendent groups may report to a wing, or they may be completely independent. They may also be organized as a n expeditionary unit, independent but too small to warrant a wing designation. The organization of th e independent group is usually similar to the operations group. Independent groups have a few squadr ons or flights from the support side added to make the organization more self-sufficient. However, this does not make the independent group large enough to become a wing. O PERATIONAL O RGANIZATION G-34. The above organizational structure is responsib le for the peacetime organization, equipping and training of aerospace units for op erational missions. When required to support operational missions, the SecDef directs a change in operational control (chop) of these units from their peacetime alignment to a CCDR. A EROSPACE E XPEDITIONARY T ASK F ORCE G-35. Chopped units are referred to as “f orces”. The top-level structure of these forces is the Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The AETF is the USAF presentation of forces to a CCDR for the employment of air power. A standing warfighting headquarters (WFHQ) supports ea ch CCDR to provide planning and execution of aerospace forces in support of CCDR requir ements. Each WFHQ consists of a Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR), and Air For ce forces staff, and an air operations center (AOC). The WFHQ may deploy air component coordinate elements to liaise with and support JFCs in the CCDR’s AOR as needed."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Military Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 G-7 G-36. The COMAFFOR is the senior USAF officer responsible for the employment of air power in support of JFC objectives. The COMAFFOR has a special staff and an A-staff to en sure assigned or attached forces are properly organized, equipped, and trained to support the operational miss ion. The AOC is the COMAFFOR’s C2 center. This center is responsible for planning and exe cuting air power missions in support of JFC objectives.

U NITED S TATES A IR F ORCE S PECIAL W ARFARE G-38. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) provides AFSOF for worldwid e deployment and assignment to regional unified commands. AFSOF are highly trained, rapidly deployab le airmen who are equipped with specialized aircraft. These forces conduct global SO missions that include precision application of firepower, infiltration, aviation FID, ex filtration, resupply, and refueling of SOF operational elements. AFSOC’s unique capabilities include airborne radio and TV broadcast for PSYOP, as well as combat aviation advisors to provide other governments with military ex pertise for their internal development. AFSOC’s special tactics squadrons combine combat controllers, SO weathermen, and pararescuemen to form versatile SOF teams. G-39. AFSOC core tasks are grouped into nine missi on areas: air-to-surface interface, agile combat support, combat aviation advisory operations, IO, ISR, personnel rec overy/recovery operations, precision fires, PSYOP dissemination, and specialized air mobility.

SEA POWER G-41. The USN is the branch of the U.S. armed forces primarily responsibl e for conducting naval operations. Its stated mission is to maintain, train, and equip co mbat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression, and maintaining freedom of the seas. The USN current ly operates 276 ships in active service and more than 4,000 aircraft.

Despite decreases in ships and personnel followi ng the Cold War, the USN has continued to spend more on technology development tha n any other navy. The USN is the world’s largest navy with a tonnage greater than that of t he next 17 largest navies combined. O RGANIZATION G-42. The USN falls under the administration of the DN and under the civilian leadership of the SECNAV. The most senior naval officer is the Chief of Naval Operations, a four-st ar admiral who reports to the SECNAV and is a member of the JCS. The SECNAV and Chief of Naval Operations are responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the USN so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified CCDRs. O PERATING F ORCES G-43. There are nine components to USN operating forces: Atlantic Fleet, Pacific Fleet, Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), Naval Forces Europe (NAVEUR), Naval Networ k Warfare Command, Navy Reserve, Naval Special Warfare Command, Operational Test and Eva luation Forces, and the Military Sealift Command. USN fleets take on the role of force provider. USN fle ets do not carry out military operations independently. They train and maintain nava l units that will subsequently be provided to the naval forces component of each unified COCOM. G-44. The USN has five active numbered fleets, each led by a vice admiral. These five fleets are grouped under Fleet Forces Command (the former Atlantic Fl eet), Pacific Fleet, NAVEUR —all led by four-star full admirals—and NAVCENT, whose commander is also commander of the Fifth Fl eet. Fleet Forces Command G-45. Fleet Forces Command is made up of the following: Submarine Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Surface Forces Atlantic, and Naval Air Forces Atlantic. Second Fleet, which operates in the Atlantic O cean from the North to South Pole, from the eastern United States to Western Europe and Af rica, and along both the eastern and western shores of Central and South America. Second Fleet is the sole numbered operational fleet within Fleet Forces Command, providing forces to Join t Forces Command. Second Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia, and its flagship is USS Wasp (LHD-1). Pacific Fleet G-46. The Pacific Fleet is made up of the following: Submarine Forces Pacific, Surface Force Pa cific, and Naval Air Forces Pacific. Third Fleet, whose jurisdiction is the northern, southern, and eas tern Pacific Ocean along with the west coast of the United States. Normally, units assigned to Third Fleet undergo training cruises before deployment with either the Fifth Fleet or Seventh Fleet. These units are not intended for immediate use in battle. Only in the event of general war does Third Fleet participate in active combat operations. Forming part of the Pacific Fleet, Third Fleet is a part of the USPACOM and is based in San Diego, California. The USS Coronado (AG F-11) is its flagship. Seventh Fleet, which is the largest forward-deploy ed U.S. fleet, operates in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, stretching to the Persian Gulf and including much o f the east coast of Africa. It forms the fully combat-ready part of the Pacific Fleet and provides naval units to the USPACOM. At any given time, Seventh Fleet consists of 40 to 50 ships operating from bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam. Seventh Fleet’s headquarters is in Yokosuka, K anagawa, Japan. Its flagship is the USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19)."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Military Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 G-9 Naval Forces Europe G-47. Sixth Fleet is deployed in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, under the ad ministrative direction of NAVEUR and the operational command of the European Command. Sixth Fleet also pr ovides the HQ and core of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO, a multinational force supporting NATO objectives in the Mediterranean. Sixth Fleet is based in Gaeta, Italy, and its flagship is USS Mount Whitney (LCC-20). Naval Forces Central Command G-48. NAVCENT includes a number of task forces that are not part of the Fifth Fleet. These include combined Task Force 150, carrying out maritime surveillance activities in the Gulf of Oman and around the Horn of Africa, and Task Force 152, covering the s outhern Persian Gulf with the same role. Both task forces report to Commander NAVCENT in his role as Combined Maritime Forces Component Commander. G-49. Fifth Fleet’s AOR is the Middle East, including th e Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, and parts of the Indian Ocean. Consisting of approximately 25 ships, including a carrier strike group and an expeditionary strike group, Fifth Fleet is effectively fused with NAVCENT, which is the naval component of the larger USCENTCOM. Fifth Fleet’s headquarters is in Manama , Bahrain. S HORE E STABLISHMENTS G-50. Shore establishment commands exist to support the mission of the afloat fleets through facilities on land. Focusing on logistics and combat readiness, they are essentia l for the full, smooth, and continuous operation of operating forces. The varieties of commands reflect the comp lexity of the modern USN and range from naval intelligence to personnel training to maintaining repair facilities. Two of the major logistics and repair commands are Naval Sea Systems Command and Naval A ir Systems Command. Other commands, such as the ONI, the U.S. Naval Observ atory, and the Navy War College are focused on intelligence and strategy. Training commands include the Naval S trike and Air Warfare Center and the U.S. Naval Academy. G-51. The Navy maintains several “naval forces commands” that operate naval shore facilities and serve as liaison units to local ground forces of the USAF and USA. Such commands are answerable to a fleet commander as the shore protector component of the afloat command. During time s of war, all naval forces commands augment to beco me task forces of a primary fleet. Some of the larger naval forces commands in the Pacific Ocean include Commander, Naval Forces Korea; Commander, Naval Forces Marianas; and Commander, Naval Forces Japan. M ILITARY S EALIFT C OMMAND G-52. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) serves not only the USN but also the ent ire DOD as the ocean carrier of materiel during peacetime and war. It transports equipment, fuel, ammunition, and other goods essential to the smooth function of U.S. armed forces worldwide. The MS C can move up to 95 percent of all supplies needed to sustain the U.S. military. It operates approximately 120 ship s with 100 more in reserve. The MSC is unique in that its ships are manned not by active d uty Navy personnel but by civil service or contract merchant mariners. G-53. Four programs make up MSC: Sealift, Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF), S pecial Mission, and Pre-positioning. The Sealift program provides the bulk of the MSC’s s upply-carrying operation and operates tankers for fuel transport and dry-cargo ship s that transport equipment, vehicles, helicopters, ammunition, and supplies. The NFAF directly replenishe s ships that are underway at sea, enabling them to deploy for long periods without having to come to port. NFAF also runs the US N’s two hospital ships, which provide emergency health care to both military personnel and civil ians. The Special Mission Program operates vessels for unique military and fede ral government tasks. These vessels perform such duties as oceanographic and hydrographic surveys, submarine support, a nd missile flight data collection and tracking. The Pre-positioning Pr ogram sustains the U.S. military’s forward presence strategy by deploying supply ships in key areas of the ocean before actually needed. I n the event of a contingency,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Appendix G G-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 these ships would be available to support military ope rations on short notice and before full-scale supply lines are established. N AVAL S PECIAL W ARFARE G-54. The U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command is in charge of USN SOF. The command currently oversees the following: Naval Special Warfare Group (N SWG) One (sea-air-land teams [SEALs], Naval Air Base, Coronado, California [CA]). NSWG Two (SEALs, Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Virginia). NSWG Three (SEAL delivery vehicle teams, Naval Air Base, Coronado, CA). NSWG Four (Special boat teams, Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Virginia). Naval Special Warfare Developmen t Group (Dam Neck, Virginia). U NITED S TATES M ARINE C ORPS G-55. Historically, the USN has enjoyed a unique relationship with the USM C, partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations. Th e USMC is a branch of the U.S. military responsible for providing power projection from the sea, using the mobility of th e USN to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces to global crises. G-56. The USMC serves as an amphibious force- in-readiness. It has three primary AORs: The seizure or defense of advanced naval base s and other land operations to support naval campaigns. The development of tactics, techniques, and equipment used by amphibious landing f orces. The duties other than the above that the President may direct. G-57. The third clause is a codification of the expeditionary duties of the USMC. The Co rps has most often performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its famous actions in the W ar of 1812, at Tripoli, Chapultepec (during the Mexican American War), and numerous counterin surgency and occupational duties in Central America and East Asia, World War I, and the Korean W ar. While these actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns or amphibious warfar e, their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature, using the mobility of the USN to provi de timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests. G-58. At the top level of civilian organization, the USMC is part of the DN and reports to the SECNAV. However, the USMC is a distinct Service branch and not a subset of the USN. The highest-ranking Marine officer, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, does not report to a naval officer. Th e Commandant is responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the USMC so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified CCDRs. There are four principal subdivisi ons in the USMC: HQ Marine Corps, the operating forces, th e supporting establishment, and the Marine Forces Reserve. G-59. The operating forces are further subdivided into th ree categories: Marine Corps forces assigned to unified commands; Marine Corps security forces guarding high-risk naval insta llations; and Marine Corps security guard detachments at American embassies, legations, and consulates a t over 110 DOS posts overseas. The USMC assigns its forces to each of the regional unified comm ands at the discretion of the SecDef and with the approval of the President. Sin ce 1991, the USMC’s component HQ are at each of the regional unified COCOMs. Marine Corps forces are further divided into Marine Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Marine Forces Pacific (MARFO RPAC), each headed by a lieutenant general. MARFORCOM has operational control of the II Mari ne Expeditionary Force (MEF); MARFORPAC has operational control of the I MEF and the III MEF. The supporting establishment inc ludes Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Marine Corps recruit depots, Marine Corps Logis tics Command, Marine bases and air stations, and the Recruiting Command."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Military Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 G-11 Capabilities G-60. Although the USMC does not employ any unique combat arms, it has, as a force, the unique ability to rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force to al most anywhere in the world within days. The basic structure for all deployed units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Forc e (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size that integrates a gro und combat element, an air combat element, and a logistics combat element under a common command element. A MAGTF can operate independently or as part of a l arger coalition. It is a temporary organization formed for a specific mission a nd dissolved after completion of that mission. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong trad ition in the Corps toward self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms—both essential assets of an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations. G-61. A MAGTF varies in size. The smal lest element is a MEU, based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite squadron. The largest element is a MEF, which ties togeth er a division, an air wing, and a logistics group under a MEF HQ Group. Th ere are usually three MEUs assigned to each of the USN Atlantic and Pacific fleets, with a seventh MEU based on Okinawa. Whi le one MEU is on deployment, one MEU is training to deploy and one is standing down, resti ng its Marines and refitting. Each MEU is capable of performing SO. The three MEFs are— I MEF located at Camp Pendleton, California. II MEF located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina (NC). III MEF located at Camp Courtney, Okinaw a, Japan (relocating to Guam in 2008). Relationship With Other Services G-62. The USMC and USN are partner Services with a closer relationship than exist s with other branches of the U.S. military. Marine air s quadrons operate alongside Navy air sq uadrons from USN aircraft carriers, though they frequently have distinct missions and ra rely fly sorties together, except to directly support Marine ground troops. Conversely, the USMC is responsible for conducting la nd operations to support naval campaigns, including the seizure of naval and air bases. Both Services opera te a network security team in conjunction. As amphibious assault specialists, Marines oft en deploy on and attack from Navy vessels. While being transported on a Navy ship, Marines must obey the orders of its captain. G-63. The Corps’ combat capabilities in land warfare over lap those of the USA. Originally organized as the Continental Marines in 1775 to serve as naval infantry, the USMC’s mis sion has evolved with changing military doctrine and American foreign policy. G-64. Although the USA now maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment, they do not match the combined-arms integration of a MAGTF. In addition, the USA does not have the logistical train that the USN provides. For this reas on, the USMC is often assigned to noncombat missions, such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries and humanitari an relief of natural disasters. In larger conflicts, Marines act as a stopgap—to get into and hold an are a until larger units mobilize. The USMC performed this role in World War I, the Korean War, and Operation DESERT STORM, where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the Unit ed States. Those Marines held the line until the country could mobilize for war. G-65. While the creation of joint commands under the Goldwater-Nichols Act has improved inter-Service coordination between the U.S. military Services, the Corps’ ability to p ermanently maintain integrated multielement task forces under a single command provides a smoother impl ementation of combined-arms warfare principles. G-66. The USMC is the smallest of the U.S. Armed Forces in the DOD (the USCG, about one-fifth the size of the USMC, is under the DHS). The Corps is noneth eless larger than the entir e armed forces of many significant military powers; for example, it is larger th an the active troop level of the Israeli Defense Forces. Marine Special Warfare G-67. In addition to the “special oper ations-capable” MEUs noted above, in 2006 the USMC agreed to supply a 2,600-strong unit, the Marine Forces Sp ecial Operations Command (MARSOC), which answers directly to USSOCOM. MARSOC trains, organizes, equips—and when direct ed by the Commander,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Appendix G G-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 USSOCOM—deploys task-organized, scalable, and responsive USMC SOF worldwide in support of CCDRs and other agencies. Component units of MARSOC include the follow ing: Marine Special Operations Advisor Gr oup, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion (1st MSOB), Camp Pendleton, Cal ifornia. 2nd MSOB, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Marine Special Opera tions Support Group. Marine Special Operations School (including a Special Missions Training Br anch on each coast). U NITED S TATES C OAST G UARD G-68. The USCG is a branch of the U.S. armed forces involved in maritime law enforcement, mariner assistance, search and rescue, and national defense. As the smallest of the five U.S. armed Services, its stated mission is to protect the public, the environment, an d the economic and security interests of the United States in any maritime region in which those interests ma y be at risk, including international waters and America’s coasts, ports, and inland waterways. G-69. The USCG is a component of th e DHS, unlike the other branches of the military, which are components of the DOD. Because the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits th e USN from enforcing U.S. laws, the USCG fulfills this role in naval operations. G-70. The USCG has a broad and important role in home land security; law enforcem ent; search and rescue; marine environmental pollution response; and the maintena nce of river, intracoastal, and offshore aids to navigation. The USCG has participated in every U. S. conflict from landing troops on D-Day and on the Pacific islands in WWII through conducting extensive patrols and shore bomba rdment during the Vietnam War to OIF. Maritime interception operations, coastal security patrols, and law enforcement detachments are the major roles in Iraq. The USCG provides law enforcement detachme nts to USN vessels to perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during Navy boarding and interdiction mi ssions. At other times, coast guard port security units are se nt overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets. The USCG also jointly staffs the USN’s naval coastal warfare groups and squadrons ( previously known as harbor defense commands), which oversee defense effort s in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas. G-71. The USCG carries out five basic missions: Maritime safety. Maritime mobility. Maritime security. National defense. Protection of natural resources. The USCG has no designated SO element. LAND POWER G-72. The USA is the largest branch of the U.S. armed forces and has primary responsibility for land-based military operations. The USA is managed by the Department of the Army, whic h is led by the Secretary of the Army. The highest-ranking military officer in the department is the Chi ef of Staff of the Army, who is a member of the JCS. S TRUCTURE G-73. Three components make up the USA: the Active Army and two reserve components, the ARNG and the USAR. Both reserve components are primarily made up of part-time Sold iers who train once a month and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Title 10 of the U.S. Code provides the organization of both the Active Army and the USAR, while Title 32 of the U.S. Code provides the organization of the ARNG. The USA organizes, trains, and equips the ARNG as one of its components. However, when it is not in federal service, it is under the command of individual sta tes’ governors. However, a presidential order can federali ze the ARNG against th e governor’s wishes."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Military Instrument of National Power 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 G-13 G-74. Since the Militia Act of 1903, all ARNG Soldiers have held dual s tatus: as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state and as a reserve of the USA under the authority of the President. Since the adoption of the total force po licy in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, reserve component Soldiers have taken a more active role in U.S. military operations. USAR and ARNG units took part in the Persian Gulf War, peacekeeping in Kosovo, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Various state defense forces also exist, sometimes known as state militias, which are sponso red by individual state governments and serve as an auxiliary to the ARNG. Except in ti mes of extreme national emergency, such as a mainland invasion of the United States, state militias operate in dependently of the USA. These militias are seen as state government agencies rather than a component of the military. G-75. Although the present-day USA exists as an all- volunteer force, augmented by USAR and ARNG forces, measures exist for emergency expansion in the event of a catastrophic occurrence, such as a large-scale attack against the United States or the outbreak of a major global war. The current “call-up” order of the USA is as follows: The Active Army volunteer force. The total mobilization of the USAR. The full-scale activation of ARNG forces. The recall of all retired personnel fit for military duty. The reestablishment of the draft and creation of a conscript force within the Active Army. The recall of previously discharged officers and enlisted personnel w ho were separated under honorable conditions. The activation of the state defense forces/state militias. The full-scale mobilization of the unorganized U.S. militia. G-76. The final stage of USA mobilization, known as “activation of the unorganized mili tia,” would effectively place all able-bodied male s in the service of the USA. The last time an approximation of this occurred was during the American Civil War when the Confederate States of Am erica activated the “home guard” in 1865, drafting all males, regardless of age or health, into the Confederate Army. A DAPTING THE M AJOR A RMY C OMMAND S TRUCTURE G-77. The Army Campaign Plan adapts major Army co mmands and specified HQ to reflect the most effective C2 structure for supporting the modular force. This deci sion defines three HQ—Army command, ASCC, and DRU. The definitions align responsibilities of these HQ to the Department of the Army and Secretary of the Army and assign theater support relationships and responsibilities.

The Army Campaign Plan accomplishes three obj ectives: it recognizes the global role and multidiscipline functions of the three Army commands , establishes the theater Army as an ASCC reporting directly to the Department while serving as the Army ’s single point of contact for a unified combatant or functional component command, and acknowledges DRUs as the functional propon ent at the Department of the Army level. G-79. As part of the same transformation plan, the USA is currently unde rgoing a transition from being a division-based force to a brigade-based force. The cent ral part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular; that is, all brigades of th e same type will be the same. This allows any division to command any brigade. There will be three major types of ground combat brigades: Heavy brigades will have approximately 3,700 troop s. They will be equivalent to a mechanized infantry brigade. Infantry brigades will have approximately 3,300 troops. They will be equiv alent to a light infantry or airborne brigade. Stryker brigades will have approximately 3,900 troops. They will be b ased around the Stryker family of vehicles. G-80. In addition, the Army Campaign Plan will establish logistics and sustainment modular brigades, aviation brigades in heavy and light varieties, fires (a rtillery) brigades, and several varieties of sustainment brigades that will function in a standard support role.

In this manual, history does not mean the profession of history—the study o f the past—so much as the concept of worldview. History is related and is per ceived as a narrative story. It is this narrative that allows for the widest range of interpretation from many perspectives. Historia ns as scholars strive to achieve an “objective” view of cause- and-effect in the past based on conclusive or reasonable evidence by academic criteria. Nonhistorians interp ret their individual and cultural hist ory by their own criteria; that is, the “historical narrative” by which each individual interprets the world as a matter of perception. Individual perceptions are a matter of subjective individual and cu ltural interpretation. They are not necessarily valid. Nevertheless, such interpretations remain powerful. H-2. It is beyond the scope of this manual to judge the relative merits o f “objective” and “subjective” truth. It is pertinent, however, to identify the many ways in which peopl e perceive individuals organized in various groups and how they prescribe to a given set of beliefs over time. Fam iliarization with how such historical and cultural issues are de fined, analyzed, and disputed provides useful insights into the context within which the informational instrument of power is effective and the manner in which forces conduct UW. As a primer for considering many of the facets of the human terrain, this appendix will survey the concepts of culture, society, civilization, state, na tion, race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, band, tradition, mythology, folklore, and religion. The importance of these concepts will vary by UWOA and specific target audience, which warrants further study of how each of these applies t o various situations. CULTURE H-3. Anthropologists use the term culture to refer to the universal human ca pacity to symbolically classify, codify, and communicate thei r experiences. As a scientific concept, it refers to patterns of huma n activity and the symbolic structures that give such ac tivity significance. In the most general sense, the term culture denotes the whole product of an individual, group, or society. I t includes technology, art, science, and the moral systems and characteristic behaviors and habits of the population unde r examination. Individuals dispute the idea of culture, which reflects different theoretical base s for understanding or criteria for evaluating human activity. H-4. Some classify culture as the way of life for an entire so ciety. As such, it includes codes of manners; dress; language; religion, rituals; norms of behavior, such as law and mora lity; and systems of belief. Edward Burnett Taylor, writing from the perspective of social anthropology in the UK in 1871, described culture in the following way: “Culture, or civilization, taken i n its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals , law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.” In 2002, th e United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization described culture as follows: “Culture should be regarde d as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual, and emotional features of society or a social group, and that it encompasses, in addition to art and literature, lifestyles, ways of liv ing together, value systems, traditions, and beliefs.” K EY C OMPONENTS OF C ULTURE H-5. A common way of understanding culture is that it c onsists of four elements that are passed on from generation to generation. The four elements are— Values . Values include ideas about what is important in life. They guide the rest of the culture. Norms . Norms are expectations of how people will behave in various situat ions. "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Appendix H H-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Institutions . Institutions are the structures of a so ciety that transmit values and norms. Artifacts . Artifacts are things or aspect s of material culture that derive from a culture’s values and norms. C ULTURE AS C IVILIZATION H-6. The culture that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th cen turies reflected inequalities within European societies and between European powers and their colonies. According to this perspective, people can classify some countries as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. H-7. From the 19th century onward, Marxists and other social critics have recognized this contrast between high and low culture but claimed that the refinement and sophi stication of high culture were corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people’s essential nature. For example, in this view, folk music (as produced by working-class people) honestly express es a natural way of life, and classical music seems a superficial and decadent represen tation of a particular social class. This view often romanticizes indigenous peoples as “noble savages” living “authentic,” un blemished lives, “uncomplicated” and “uncorrupted” by the highly stratified capitalist syst ems of the West. This view rejects the opposition of culture to nature. Those that subscribe to this view assert that nonelites are as cultured as elites (and nonwesterners just as civilized as western ers, simply regarding them as just cultured—or civilized—in a different way). This pe rspective underlies an egalitarian, multicultural worldview in reaction to more ethnocentric and nationalistic worldvie ws emphasized in the 19th and 20th centuries. C ULTURE AS S HARED S YMBOLS H-8. Culture holds symbols to be both the practices of social actors and the context tha t gives such practices meaning. Symbols provide the limits of cultured thought. C ULTURE AS A S TABILIZING M ECHANISM FOR S URVIVAL H-9. The view of culture as a “stabilizing mechanism” considers the pos sibility that culture itself is a product of stabilization tendencies. For example, indivi duals identify with those cu ltural artifacts, symbols, and practices that foster feelings of survival, secur ity, and (eventually) self-actualization. Allegiance to a culture for these reasons te nds to perpetuate it. C ULTURE AS U NBOUNDED A CTIVITY H-10. Some scholars (particularly sociologists and Marxists) focus on the study of “arti facts” to understand culture. The patterns involving value and transfer of consumption goods (suc h as fashion, art, and literature) have been a common means of analyzing cultural patterns. With modern reactions to the 18th- and 19th-century distinction between “high” and “low” culture, such scholars tend to emphasize mass-produced and mass-marketed consumption goods of “popular” culture. H-11. However, other contemporary scholars (particularly anthropologists) reject the i dentification of culture with consumption goods and de-emphasize the defining role of any artifacts. This view rejects the notion of culture as “bounded” by a set class of defini ng attributes. Such scholars consequently reject the notion of mainstream “culture” or “subculture” altogeth er. Instead, they see culture as a complex web of shifting patterns at any given time that link people in different locales in to social formations of different scales. According to this view, any group can construct its own cultural i dentity. C ULTURAL C HANGE H-12. Each culture, however defined, is predisposed to either embrace or resist change based on its particular cultural traits. Two kinds of influence cause ch ange or resistance to it: forces at work within or"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Role of History and Culture 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 H-3 between cultures and changes in the natural environment. Some of the t erms associated with cultural change include the following: Diffusion . The form of something moves directly from one culture to another. For example , a culture adopts fashion or music styles unchanged from another culture. Stimulus diffusion . Exposure of one culture to another that leads to new and different activity or products. For example, exposure to American blues music in the early 20th c entury led to newly developed styles of rock and roll in mid-20th-century Britain. Acculturation . In this context, it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another. For example, certain indigenous peoples across the globe ado pted the culture of the entering power during the process of colonization. Assimilation . This term reflects a more complete leve l of acculturation wherein those assimilated effectively become a part of the mainstream culture. For example, the descendents of 19th-century European immigrants to America have largely assimilated into “American” culture. H-13. Cultural change or resistance to change can be difficult to measure—esp ecially the diffusion, acceptance, and rejection of ideas. In the context of 21st- century globalization and with a view of culture as “unbounded,” culture can be a complex and subjective matter of definiti on, interpretation, and self-identification. C ULTURES W ITHIN A S OCIETY H-14. The idea of culture is inexact. Large societies often have subcultu res, or groups of people with distinct sets of behavior and beliefs. Subculture may be distinctive because of many factors: age, race, ethnicity, class, gender, behavior patterns, and so on. C ULTURES BY R EGION H-15. In practical terms, world region can identify current broad cultural influences. Through out history, contact with others through conquest, colonization, trade, migrati on, mass media, and religion has influenced all predominant regional cultures. Examples of this influence foll ow: Africa . European colonialism and Arabic and Islamic culture. America . Colonialism, immigration and Christianity. Asia . Chinese language and culture, Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, and Islam. Oceania . Aboriginal culture, the indigenous Maori people, and Christianity. Europe . Ancient Greece and Rome; Christianity; Eu ropean culture and languages, such as English, Spanish, and French. Middle East and North Africa . Persian culture and Arabic language. SOCIETY H-16. Closely related to the term culture is the notion of society. A society is a grouping of individuals characterized by common interest and, sometimes, a distinctive culture and institutions. In a society, members can be from a different ethn ic group. A society may refer to a pa rticular people, such as the Nuer, to a nation-state, such as Switzer land, or to a broader cultural group, such as western society. C HARACTERISTICS OF S OCIETY H-17. The three components common to all definitions of society are— Social networks. Criteria for membership. Characteristic patterns of organization."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Appendix H H-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Social Networks H-18. Social networks are relationships between people. Ex amples of social networks are relatives, friends, and colleagues. Criteria for Membership H-19. The most common entrance to membership of any gi ven society is to be born into it, where the individual generally accepts and reflects its norms. In this sense, society and culture are sometimes indistinguishable. Continued self-identification with and support of t he original society is the most common method of sustaining membership. H-20. Society is not necessarily synonymous with state or nation. Sometimes , peoples of many nations united by common political and cultural traditions, shar ed beliefs or values, or common goals form a society (such as Judeo-Christian, eastern, and western). When used in this context, the term is a means of contrasting two or more large “societies” whose me mbers represent alternativ e conflicting and competing worldviews. Other examples include some small academic, learned, and scholarly associations that describe themselves as societies or as used in some countries to denote a partnership between commercial investors. Characteristic Patterns of Organization H-21. Experts classify societies in various ways. For example: Hunters and gatherers. Simple agricultural. Advanced agricultural. Industrial. H-22. Societies may also organize according to their politi cal structure or by the st atus of individuals, complexity, and the role of the state: Hunter-gatherer bands. Tribal societies. Kingdoms and early modern European nation-states. Civilizations with complex social hierarchies. C ONCEPT OF S OCIETY H-23. Some societies disappear, while others have progressed toward ever more co mplex forms. Some dispute the concept of society. Some sociologists and anthropologist s question whether society as an entity exists. Some Marxist theorists argue that society is nothing m ore than an effect of the ruling ideology of a certain class system. They contend th at people should not use society as a sociological notion. Marx held that society was merely the sum total of social relations among members of a community. Many Muslims identify more readily with “Islamic society” than they do with any particular state or nation. Regardless of ideology, the way people define so ciety explains much about them. CIVILIZATION H-24. The term “civilization” has a variety of meanings related to human so ciety. Most often, civilization refers to complex societies—those that have an intensive practice of agri culture, have a significant division of labor, and have population densities sufficient to form cities. People ma y use civilization more broadly to refer to the sum or current ex tent of human accomplishment and diff usion (human civilization or global civilization). H-25. The term “civilization” in common speech has both a normative and a des criptive dimension. In the past, to be “civilized” was linked to the act of being “civil”—a term for politeness and propriety. To be “uncivilized” in this usage means to be rude, barbaric, or savage. In this sense, civilization implies sophistication and refinement. The problem with this concept i s that some people who lived outside of a"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Role of History and Culture 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 H-5 given, recognized civilization could nonetheless be quite civilized in their beha vior. Many world cultures throughout history have used the normative definition of “civiliza tion” to justify imperialism. H-26. In reaction to this disparaging meaning of civilization, academia has broadened the term so that “civilization” can often refer to any di stinct society, whether complex and city dwelling or simple and tri bal (for example “Australian aboriginal civilization”). People often perceive this sense of the term as less exclusionary and ethnocentric, because it does not make distinctions between civi lized or barbaric. However, this less-ethnocentric approach to the term weakens its descriptive powe r. Such a usage is both less useful and meaningful than the first. In this sense, civilization becomes nearly synonymous with culture. H-27. In contrast, civilization can also legitimately describe the cult ure of a complex society, not just simple societies or society itself. Every society has a specific set of ideas, customs, items, and arts that make it unique. However, civilizations have even more intricate cultures, including literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion, and complex customs. It is a matte r of degree. The description of a “culture” as a “civilization,” therefore, is another contentious and vagu ely defined concept. C HARACTERISTICS OF C IVILIZATION H-28. Civilizations are complex systems or networks of cities that emerge from preurban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, and cultura l interactions between them. Therefore, as a descriptive and literal term, a civilization is a complex soc iety, as distinguished from a simpler society. Historically, civilizations have shared some or all of the foll owing traits: Agricultural techniques. Division of labor. Permanent settlements. Social organization. Institutional food control. Complex social institutions. Complex economic exchange. Material possessions. Advanced technology. Advanced arts. Long existence. H-29. By these characteristics, some so cieties, like Greece, are clearly ci vilizations, whereas others, like the Bushmen or the early nomadic Native Americans, clearly are not. Howeve r, the distinction is not always clear and is often in dispute. C IVILIZATION AS H UMAN -S OCIETY - AS - A -W HOLE H-30. Some argue that the entire world is already integrated into a single world system, by a process known as “globalization.” Different civilizations and societies all ov er the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began and what sort of integration—cultural, technological, economic, politica l, or military/diplomatic—is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. H-31. In this broader sense, “civilization” can refer to human society as a whole—the “global civilization.” What globalization means and how to characterize are also in dispute. Critics of “globalization” reject such a coupling of the terms, saying that what is called “globalization” is in fact a form of “global corporatization” and that other forms of “globalization” are possible (such as Communist world government or a worldwide Islamic caliphate). Others argue that globalization and ongoin g future integration inherently erode the distinct sovereignty of states. Still others believe that states will continue to be politically meaningful despite the technological and economi c integration of continued globalization. Despite ideology, people widely accept that the “world ci vilization” is increas ingly integrating."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Appendix H H-6 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 STATE H-32. As noted above, a state is a set of institutions that possess the a uthority to make the rules that govern the people in one or more societies with internal sovereignty over a definite territory. It is casually and most commonly confused with “country,” which refers to a geographic area and “nation,” wh ich designates a people. NATION H-33. A nation is a group of humans that people assume share a common identity and a common language, religion, ideology, culture, or history. People often assume that individual s in groups have a common origin, in the sense of ancest ry, parentage, or descent. H-34. The national identity refers both to the distinguishin g features of the group and to the individual’s sense of belonging to it. People use a very wide range of criteria with very different applications to determine national identity. Small differences in pronunciation m ay be enough to categorize someone as a member of another nation. However, two people may be separated by differe nce in personalities, belief systems, geographical locations, time, and even spoken language yet regard themselves (and others may regard them as well) as members of the same nation. Members of a nation are considered to share certain traits, values, and norms of behavior; certain duties toward other m embers; and certain responsibilities for the actions of the members of the same nation. H-35. Nations extend across generations and include the dead as full members. More vaguely, people include future generations as members. People frame past events in t his context; for example, referring to “our soldiers” in conflicts that took place hundreds of years ago. H-36. People often use the term “nation” as a synonym for ethnic group. However, al though ethnicity is now one of the most important aspects of cultural or social identity for th e members of most nations, people with the same ethnic origin may live in different na tion-states, and people may treat them as members of separate nations for that reason. People often disput e national identity, down to the level of the individual. H-37. Almost all nations are associated with a specifi c territory, the national homeland. Some live in historical communities outside of their original national ho meland. A state that explicitly identifies as the homeland of a particular nation is a nation-state, and most modern states fall into this category, although there may be violent disputes about their legitimacy. When nations dispute t erritory, the nations may base their claims on which nation lived there first. Esp ecially in areas of European colonial settlement (1500-1950), the term “first nations” is used by some groups that share an ab original culture and seek official recognition or autonomy. A MBIGUITY IN U SAGE H-38. In the strict sense, terms such as “nation,” “ethn os,” and “people” (for example, the “Danish people”) name a group of human beings. The concepts of nation and nationality h ave much in common with ethnic group and ethnicity but have a more political connotation, since th ey imply the possibility of a nation-state. Country names a geographical territory, whereas st ate expresses a legitimi zed administrative and decision-making institution. Confusingly, some use the terms “natio nal” and “international” as technical terms applying to states. International law, for instan ce, applies to relations between states and occasionally between states on the one side and individuals or legal persons on the othe r. Likewise, the UN represents states, while nations are not admitted to the body (unl ess a respective nation-state exists, which can become a member). H-39. Usage also varies from country to country. For example, the UK is an internationall y recognized sovereign state, which is also a country whose inhabitants have Britis h nationality. It is, however, traditionally divided into four home nations—England, Scotland, Wales , and Ireland. Three of these are not sovereign states. Ireland, however, is now divided into the sovereign R epublic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which remains part of the UK. H-40. Usage of the term “nation” not only is ambiguous but also is the subject of political disputes, which may be extremely violent. When the term “nation” has any implications of claims to independence from an"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Role of History and Culture 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 H-7 existing state, its use is controversial. Finally, the term “nation” is widely used by extension or metaphor to describe any group promoting some common interest or common identity, s uch as “Red Sox nation,” “rhythm nation,” or “religious nation.” N ATIONALISM H-41. In Europe, especially since the late 18th century, the idea of nation as sumed a fundamental political significance with the rise of the ideology and philosophy of national ism. Nationalists saw a nation not simply as a descriptive term for a group of people bu t as an entity entitled to sovereignty, if necessary, by the absorption or destruction of nonnational states. H-42. There is no consensus among the theorists of nationalism on whether nations were a s ignificant political factor before that time. Some historians see England and Portugal as early examples of nation-states, with a developed sense of national id entity. Others see the nation-state as a 19th century creation, either as the result of the political campaigns of nationa lists or as a top-down and indoctrinated creation by preexisting states. Some Marxists and world civilizati on-oriented theorists are hostile to the idea of “centuries-old nations” that nationalists claimed to represent, a rguing that nations are often imagined communities constructed through a variety of techniques using state power. The generally accepted but eroding idea that populations divide Europe into nations has existed since at least the 19th century. H-43. In the course of the 20th century, partly through decolonization, a world of nati on-states came into existence, at least nominally. That does not mean that there is any agreement on the number of nations, on whether they correspond with a natio n-state, or on whether any partic ular existing state is necessarily legitimate. Very few nation-state’s territory and borders are 100 percen t undisputed. Political actors make claims on behalf of stateless nations, such as the Kurds, Assyrians, Palestin ians, or Roma people (gypsies). Secessionist movements may oppose the very existence of the nati on-state, as in Belgium. Some nationalist movements request greater autonomy within the framework of the broader sta te (for example, the Basque in Spain, Quebecois in Canada, or Native Americans in the western h emisphere). Claimed national territory may be partitioned or divided, as in the Republic of Ireland and Nort hern Ireland. There are also examples of national identity without a corresponding state or cl aim to a state. Although it is common to attribute political and territorial aspirations to a nation itself, political movements speaking on behalf of that nation make these aspirations. H-44. People sometimes use the term “state-nation” for nations in which th e common identity derives from shared citizenship of a stat e. This term implies that the state formed first followed by a sense of na tional identity or that it developed in tandem. Examples of state-nations are Italy and France. However, both countries also have a strong ethnic and cultural identity. If the people defined the nation only by citizenship, then the people would acce pt naturalized citizens as equal memb ers of the nation and that is not always the case. Citizenship may itself be conditional on a citizen ship test, which usually includes language and cultural knowledge tests. D EFINING A N ATION H-45. Nations are defined by a limited number of character istics that apply to both the individual members and the nation. The first requirement for the definition is that the characteristics should be shared—a group of people with nothing in common cannot be a nation. Because they are shared, the nationa l population also has some degree of uniformity and homogeneity. Finally, at least some of the chara cteristics must be exclusive—to distinguish the nation from neighboring nations. All of the charac teristics can be disputed and opposition to seces sionist nationalism often includes the de nial that a separate nation exists. C OMMON DESCENT H-46. Almost all nationalist movements make some claim to shared origins and descent, and it is a component of the national identity in most nations. Th e fact that members of the nation share ancestry unites them and sets them apart from other nations that do not share that ancestry. The question is: descent"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Appendix H H-8 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 from whom? Often, the answer is simply from previous generations of the same nation. More specifically— The nation may be defined as the descendants of the past inhabitants of th e national homeland. The nation may be defined as the descendants of past speakers of the nationa l language or past groups that shared the national culture. H-47. Usually, people assume these factors coincide. Icel and provides an example. People assume the well-defined Icelandic nation consists of the descendants of the isla nd of Iceland in, for example, 1850. Those people also spoke the Icelandic language. They were known as Icel anders at that time. They had a recognized culture of their own. Ho wever, the present population of Iceland cannot coincide exactly with their descendants; that would mean that no Icelander since 1850 ever had children by a non-Icelander. Most European nations experienced border changes and migration over the last few centuries and members intermarried with other national groups. Statistically, their current national population cannot coincide exactly with the descendants of the nation in 1850 or 1500, even if it w as then known by the same name. The shared ancestry is more of a national myth than a genetic realit y—but still sufficient for a national identity. C OMMON L ANGUAGE H-48. People often view a shared language as a defining feature of a nation. In some cases, the language is exclusive to the nation. This language may be central to the nat ional identity. The Basque language is a unique language isolate and prominent in the self-definition of the Basque pe ople and in Basque nationalism, although not all Basques speak it. In other cases, other nations also speak the national language (shared among the nation, but not exclusive to the nation). Som e peoples, such as the Swiss, identify themselves as multilingual. Conversely, Papua New Guinea prom otes a “Papuan” national identity, despite having around 800 distinct languages. People do not define any nation solely by language—that would effectively create an open membersh ip for anyone who learned the language. C OMMON C ULTURE H-49. People define most nations partly by a shared culture. Unlike a langu age, a national culture is usually unique to the nation, although it may include many elements shared with other nations. In addition, people assume that previous generations shared the national culture and that they shar e a cultural heritage from these generations, as if it were an inheritance. As with the common ancestry, th is identification of past culture with present culture may be largely symbolic. The archaeological site of Stonehenge is owned and managed by English heritage, although no “English” people or state existed when it was constructed 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. Other nations have similarly appr opriated ancient archaeological sites, literature, art, and even entire civilizations as a national heritage. C OMMON R ELIGION H-50. People sometimes use religion to define a nation, although some nat ionalist movements de-emphasize it as a divisive factor. Again, it is the sh aring of the religion that makes it national. It may not be exclusive. Several nations define themselves partly as Cathol ic although the religion itself is Universalist. Irish nationalism traditionally sees Ca tholicism as an Irish national characteristic, in opposition to the largely Protestant British colonial power (although the Iris h Republic usually recognizes the Protestant minority in Ireland as Irish). Some religions are largely speci fic to one ethnic group, notably Judaism. Nevertheless, the Zionist movement generally avoided a religious de finition of the “Jewish people,” preferring an ethnic and cultural definition. Since Judaism is a re ligion, people can become a Jew by religious conversion, which in turn can facilitate their obtaining Israeli citizenship. Jews in Israel who convert to other religions do not lose Israeli citizenship, although th eir national identity might then be questioned by others."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Role of History and Culture 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 H-9 V OLUNTARY D EFINITIONS H-51. Some ideas of a nation emphasize not shared charact eristics, but rather on the shared choice for membership. In practice, this always applies to a group of people who are al so a nation by other definitions. The most famous “voluntarist” definition is that of Ernest Renan. In a lecture i n 1882, he rhetorically asked “What is a nation?” and answered that it is a “daily plebiscite.” Re nan meant that the members of the nation by their daily participation in the life of the nation show their consent t o its existence and to their own continued membership. Renan saw the nation as a group “having done great thin gs together and wishing to do more.” S TALIN ’ S D EFINITION H-52. Many definitions of a nation combine several of these factors. One influent ial example of these combined definitions is that of Joseph Stalin given in 1913: “A nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life , and psychological makeup manifested in a common culture.” RACE H-53. The term “race” serves to distinguis h between populations or groups of people based on different sets of characteristics that can be determined either through scientific co nventions or, more commonly, through social conventions. Visual traits are the most widely used human racial categories (especially skin co lor, facial features, and hair texture), genes, and self-i dentification. Conceptions of race and specific racial groupings vary by culture and over time. They are often controversial fo r scientific reasons and because of their impact on social identity and identity politics. Many conte mporary biological and social scientists regard the concept of race primarily as a social cons truct, while some maintain it has a genetic basis. ETHNIC GROUP H-54. An ethnic group or ethnicity is a population of humans whose members identify with each other, usually on a presumed common genealogy or ancestry. Recognition by others as a separate ethnic group and a specific name for the group also contribute to defining it. Certain common cultural , behavioral, linguistic, and ritualistic or religious traits also usually unite ethnic groups. In this sense, an ethnic group is also a cultural community. H-55. Because of closely related definitions, an ethnic gr oup can overlap or even coincide with a nation, especially when terms of common origin primarily define national id entity. Members of nations also identify with each other. They often presume a common ancestry. In addition, othe rs recognize them as a distinct group with a specific name. Nations also have a common id entity: always cultural, usually linguistic, and sometimes religious. An ethnic group that is also a nation can be t he named head of a nation-state; however, ethnic groups as such are not a state and possess no territorial sovereignty. Members of an ethnic group generally claim a strong cultural continuity over tim e. H-56. While ethnicity and race are related concepts, the conc ept of ethnicity is rooted in the idea of social groups and is marked especially by shared nationality, tribal affiliat ion, genealogy, religious faith, language, or cultural and traditional origins, whereas r ace is traditionally rooted in the idea of a biological classification. TRIBE H-57. A tribe, viewed historically or developmentally, consists of a s ocial group existing before the development of or outside of states, although some modern theorists hold that contemporary tribes can only be understood in terms of their relationship to states. People often use the term loosely to refer to any nonwestern or indigenous society. Many anthropologists use the term to re fer to societies organized largely based on kinship, especially descent groups. In the common modern un derstanding, the word tribe is a social division within a traditional society consisti ng of a group of interlinked families or communities sharing a common culture and dialect. In the contempor ary western mind, the modern tribe is typically"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Appendix H H-10 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 associated with a seat of traditional authority (tribal l eader) with whom the representatives of external (for example, state or occupying) powers interact. H-58. Considerable debate takes place over how best to ch aracterize tribes. Some of this debate stems from perceived differences between prestate tribes and contemporary tribes. Some of this debate reflects controversy over cultural evolution and colonialism. In the popular imagin ation, tribes reflect a way of life that predates and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also grant primary social ties, contain clear boundaries, demonstrate uniform culture, manife st a narrow outlook, and establish stability. Thus, many believed that tribes organize links between families (including clans and lineages) and provide them with a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some w ay more limited than that of an “ethnic group” or of a “nation.” H-59. Anthropological and ethnohistorical research challenges all of these n otions. In his 1972 study, The Notion of the Tribe , Morton Fried provided numerous examples of tribes in which members spoke different languages and practiced different rituals or shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes. Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in whic h people followed different political leaders or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes. He concluded that generally f luid boundaries and dissimilarity characterized tribes, in general. He determined that tribes have open outlooks and are dynamic. CLAN H-60. A clan is a group of people united by kinship and descent, which is defined by perceived de scent from a common ancestor. Even if actual lineage patte rns are unknown, clan memb ers nonetheless recognize a founding member or original ancestor. As kinship-based bonds can be merely sym bolical, some clans share a “stipulated” common ancestor, which is a symbol of the clan’s unity. Sometimes this ancestor is not human. Generally, kinship differs from biological relation, as it also involve s adoption, marriage, and fictional genealogical ties. Clans can be most easily de scribed as subgroups of tribes and usually constitute groups of 7,000 to 10,000 people. H-61. Some clans are patrilineal, meaning its members are related through t he male line. Others are matrilineal; its members are related through the female lin e. Still other clans are bilateral, consisting of all the descendants of the original ancestor through bo th the male and female lines. Whether a clan is patrilineal, matrilineal, or bilateral depends on the kinship rul es and norms of their society. H-62. In different cultures and situations, a clan may mean the same thing as other ki n-based groups, such as tribes and bands. Often, the distinguishing factor is th at a clan is a smaller part of a larger society, such as a tribe, chiefdom, or a state. Examples include Iris h, Scottish, Chinese, and Japanese clans, which exist as kin groups within their respective nations. However, tribes and bands can also be components of larger societies. Arab tribes are small gr oups within Arab society, and Ojibwa bands are smaller parts of the Ojibwa tribe. H-63. Apart from these different traditions of kinship, further confusion arises from com mon use of the term. In post-Soviet countries, for example, it is quite common for the term to refer to informal networks within the economic and political sphere. This usage re flects the assumption that their members act toward each other in a particularly close and mutually supportive way approximating the solidarity among kinsmen. H-64. People sometimes better refer to cl ans as a “house” or “line.” In some cases, a house or line consists of a collection of families bearing the same coat of arms, as opposed to ac tually claiming a common descent. Most clans are exogamous, meaning that its members cannot m arry one another. Some clans have an official leader, such as a chie ftain, matriarch, or patriarch. BANDS H-65. A band society is the simplest form of human society. A band generally consists of a small kin group no larger than an extended family or clan. Bands ha ve very informal leadership. There are no written laws in bands. In addition, the coercion normally present in more complex so cieties does not exist in bands. Younger members of the band look to older members for guidance and advice. Band members usually transmit customs orally. Formal social institutions ar e few or nonexistent. Generally, family tradition,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Role of History and Culture 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 H-11 individual experience, or shamanic counsel is the basis of the band’s relig ion. All known band societies hunt and gather to obtain their food. H-66. Fried defined bands as “small, mobile, and fluid social formations with wea k leadership that do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standi ng army.” Bands are distinguished from tribes in that tribes are generally larger and consist of many families. Social roles exist in tribes, such as a chief or elders. Tribes are also more permanent than bands. A band can cease to exist if only a small group walks out. Many tribes are in fact subdivided into bands. In th e United States, some tribes are made up of official bands that live in specific locations. With the spread of the modern nation-state to all corners of the globe, there are very few true band societies left. Some historic examples include th e Inuit of northern North America, the Shoshone of the great basin, the bushmen of southern Africa, an d some groups of indigenous Australians. TRADITION H-67. A tradition is a story or a custom that a person memorizes and passes down f rom generation to generation. Traditions are usually thought of as— A meme, which is a unit of cultural information passed down orally. A set of customs or practices. A broad religious movement made up of religious denominations or church bodi es that have a common history, customs, cultu re, and body of teachings. H-68. On a more basic theoretical level, traditions are info rmation brought into the present from the past in a particular societal context. This is even more fu ndamental than particular acts or practices even if repeated over a long sequence of time. For such acts or practices, once performed, disappear unless they are transformed into some manner of communicable information. H-69. Although people usually presume that traditions are ancient, unalterable , and deeply important, this is not necessarily true. People or groups sometimes deliberately invent some “t raditions” for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution. People also change traditions to suit the needs of the day, and the changes quickly become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition. Some examples include “the invention of tradition” in Afric a and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces. Requiring legitimacy, the colonial power would sometimes invent a tradition that they could use to legitimize their own position. For example, a force mi ght recognize a certain succession to chiefdom by a colonial power as traditional to favor their favorite candidate for the job. Often the force based these inventions on some form of tradition. However, these were grossly exaggerated, di storted, or biased toward a particular interpretation. MYTHOLOGY H-70. A mythology is a narrative, oral tradition, or a popular belief or assu mption based on the heroes of a culture. Mythology sometimes involves supernatural events or characters to explain the nature of the universe and humanity. The term myth is often used interchangeably with le gend or allegory. C HARACTERISTICS H-71. Myths are narratives about divine or heroic beings arranged in a coherent syste m. Myths often explain the universal and local beginnings, natural pheno mena, inexplicable cultural conventions or rituals, and anything else for which no simple explanation exists. H-72. Individual myths may be classified in various categories: Ritual myths. Origin myths. Creation myths. Cult myths. Prestige myths. Eschatological myths."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Appendix H H-12 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 Social myths. Trickster myths. F ORMATION OF M YTHS H-73. Myths authorize the cultural institutions of a trib e, a city, or a nation by connecting them with universal truths. All cultures have developed their own myths, consisting of nar ratives of their history, their religions, and their heroes. FOLKLORE H-74. Folklore is the body of expressive culture, including tales, music, dance, legends, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, customs, and material culture common to a particular po pulation, comprising the traditions of that cu lture. The definition most widely accep ted by current scholars of the field is “artistic communication in small groups.” The te rm, and the associated field of study, now includes nonverbal art forms an d customary practices. H-75. Contemporary narratives common in the western world include the urban le gend. There are many forms of folklore that are so common, however, that mo st people do not realize th ey are folklore, such as riddles, children’s rhymes, ghost stories, rumors, gossip, ethnic stere otypes, holiday custom, and life-cycle rituals. RELIGION H-76. A religion is a set of beliefs and practices held by a community that involves a dherence to codified beliefs and rituals and the study of ancestral or cultural traditions and my thology, as well as personal faith and mystic experience. H-77. The Encyclopedia of Religion describes religion in the following way: “In summary, it may be said that almost every known cu lture involves the religious in the sense of a ‘depth dimension’ i n cultural experiences at all levels—a push, whether ill-defined or conscious, t oward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. W hen more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life arou nd the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity IAW the en vironing culture.” R ELIGION AS A S OCIAL C ONSTRUCTION H-78. Those who assert that religion—however defined—is an overall positive are as numerous as the number of religious adherents. Inherently, each individual’s religious adherence en tangles with the ways he identifies with all of the other characteristics of huma n organization. Therefore, most individual’s religious adherence interweaves with tradition and ideas of cultu re, society, mythology, and so on. Conversely, all philosophies and orthodoxies—including religious philo sophies and orthodoxies—have their disputants. In the 21st century western world, most Marxists and some scientists are the most strident critics of “religion.” R ELIGIONS AS P ROGRESSIVELY T RUE H-79. Within these models, religions reflect an essential truth that is revealed as society develops. Models that view religion as progressively true include the following: The Baha’i model of prophetic revelation . This model holds that god has sent a series of prophets to earth, each brining t eachings appropriate for his cultu re and context but originating from the same god and, therefore, teaching the same essential message. While religious truth is seen as being relative because of its varied cultural and developm ental expression, this model accepts that the underlying essential truth being ex pressed is absolutely tr ue, if incompletely and progressively presented. The study of history model . This model holds that prophets are given to extraordinary spiritual insight during periods of social decay and act as surveyors of th e course of secular civilization"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Role of History and Culture 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 H-13 who report breaks in the road and breakdowns in the traffic and plot a ne w spiritual course that will avoid those pitfalls. The great awakening model. This model states that religion proceeds along a Hegelian dialectic of thesis, antithesis, synthesis, in cycles of appr oximately 80 years as a result of the interaction between four archetypal generations, by which old religious beliefs (the thesis ) face new challenges for which they are unprepared (the antithesis) and adapt to create new and more sophisticated beliefs (the synthesis). R ELIGIONS AS A BSOLUTELY T RUE H-80. Some models see religion as absolutely and unchangi ngly true. Models that view a particular religion as absolutely true include the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic models. Exclusiv ist models hold that one particular set of religious doctrines is the one true re ligion and all others are false to the extent that they conflict with the true one. In this model, all other religio ns are seen as either distor tions of the original truth or original fabrications resulting from either ignorance or imagination or a more de vious influence, such as false prophets. R ELIGIOUS B ELIEF H-81. Religious belief usually relates to the existence, nature, and worshi p of a deity or deities and divine involvement in the universe and human life. It may also relate to val ues and practices transmitted by a spiritual leader. Religious beliefs are found in vi rtually every society throughout human history. All religions generally seek to provide answers to metaphysical and cosmolo gical questions about the nature of being, of the universe, humanity, and the divine. H-82. Many early scientists held strong religious beliefs and many theories exist as to why religions sometimes seem to conflict with scientific knowledge. In the case of Christianity, a relevant factor may be that it was among Christians that science in the modern sense was developed. U nlike other religious groups, as early as the 17th century the Christian churches had to deal d irectly with this new way to investigate nature and seek truth. The practice of literally int erpreting the Bible partially explains the perceived conflict between science and Christianity. Th is way to read the sacred texts became especially prevalent after the rise of the Protestant Reform ation, with its emphasis on the Bible as the only authoritative source concerning ultimate reality. In contra st, this view is often shunned by both religious leaders who prefer a metaphorical interpretation and many scienti sts who regard it as an impossibility. The proper relationship of religion to science remains an unsettled matt er of widely varied opinion. H-83. Some Christians disagree with scientists on astronomy, the theory of evolut ion, and the nature of creation and origin of life. Others find no contradic tion in a metaphorical interpretation of their faith with scientific inquiry. Islam sees a ll endeavor as god’s will, so scie ntific endeavor is theoretically unobjectionable. However, particular Muslim observa nce and tolerance for scientific consensus varies widely in Muslim societies ranging from theocratic Iran through democ ratic Malaysia to Muslim minorities in the United States. Other faiths such as Baha’ism and Hinduism maintain there is no disharmony between true science and true religion, because they are aspects of the same “truth.” "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank.

The United States has considerable experience in conducting UW . The best known U.S. UW campaigns include OSS activities in Europe and the Pacific (1942–45), Philippines (1941–44), Guatemala (1950), Cuba (1960–61), North Vietnam (1964–72), South Vietnam (1967–72), Iraq (1991–96 ), OEF (2001–02), and OIF (2002–03). Below is a brief but expanded representative samp ling of such operations. UNITED STATES-PHILIPPINE RESISTANCE TO JAPANESE OCCUPATION (1942–1945) I-2. U.S. support to and in some cases leadership of irregular resist ance to Japanese forces in the Philippine archipelago was an unqualified success. It sta nds as a premier example of what military planners today call operational preparation of the environment. The Philippine resis tance movement, made up of a number of groups spread throughout the archipelago but most numerous on the main island of Luzon, collected and transmitted intelligence on adversary or der of battle, conducted hit-and-run raids against Japanese forces, and provided de facto government services in a number of villages. The resistance movement benefited from environmental factors that contributed to the overall success of the campaign. These factors included the size of the archipelago (almost 115,000 square meters) spread out over 7,100 islands and the imposing jungle and mountain terrain on the largest islands. Both fa ctors, as well as the requirement to maintain lines of communications an d supply between garrisons, severely stretched the occupying Japanese forces. Although the Japanese in itially offered positive or neutral incentives not to resist, such as amnesty to military stragglers and those under arms, inc reasing negative measures (including collective reprisals against villagers for attacks; impris onment, torture, or execution of suspected guerrillas; and seizing crops and livestock) turned the population against them. UNITED NATIONS PARTISAN OPERATIONS IN KOREA (1951–1953) I-3. Success and failure in waging UW can be difficult to judge. In the case of UW conducted during the Korean War, the evidence seems contradictory. A lthough UN partisan forces contributed to allied interdiction efforts in the operational rear areas of North Korea, the movement nevertheless failed to achieve more widespread strategic success. Most if not all of the preconditions for UW success existed on the Korean peninsula, but a number of factors inhibited the success of UN partisa n forces. First, the responsibility for UN partisan oper ations shifted between different command instruments, none of which had developed a comprehensive plan or phasing for UW in the theater. Seco nd, the command used UN partisan forces primarily for seaborne raids not unlike British commando raids in WWII—not for organization of an indigenous organization. The purpose of these raids wa s to interdict main supply routes, inflict casualties, and boost the morale of anticommunist instrume nts in North Korea. The command applied little effort to establishing sanctuaries and base areas on the peninsula itself or cultivating the population to support an insurgency. From 19 52 onward, the North Koreans placed greater emphasis on rear area counterpartisan operations that limited the mobility and a ccess of UN partisan forces to the North Korean population. Finally, and most significantly, U. S. advisors to UN partisan forces neither spoke Korean nor understood the culture. This lack of preparation seriously influ enced the ability of UN partisan forces to undertake UW actions more co mplicated than episodic raids-in-force."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Appendix I I-2 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 UNITED STATES UNCONVE NTIONAL WARFARE IN NORTH VIETNAM (1964–1972) I-4. With few possible exceptions, U.S. UW efforts in North Vietnam were among the least successful of any it has attempted. According to Conboy and Andrade, U.S. UW efforts failed bec ause of a “lack of imagination in planning, faulty execution of missions, and poor operational security.” Although originally planned and controlled by the CIA in 1960, responsibility for U.S. UW activities was shifted to the DOD in 1964. Most of the activities subsequently conducted in Northern Vietn am bore a striking similarity to missions conducted by the OSS during WWII. These missions included parachuting lone Vietnamese agents or teams of agents deep into North Vietnam to gather and report intelligence or conduct attacks. Maritime missions included short-term seaborne ra ids, agent insertion, and deception/psychological warfare operations. Such UW was designed to distract North Vietnamese attent ion, as well as resources, to combating saboteurs operating in their homeland. The re sults of these UW efforts were dismal. The fact that such operations continued despite persistent evidence of th eir failure is a testament to the lack of imagination mentioned above, as well as the bravery of most of the Vietnamese volunteers. The inability of U.S. planners to set meaningful strategic and operational objectives for UW a nd the haphazard and uncoordinated use of UW troops si mply because the optio n existed—without any hope of generating support among the local populous—ultimately doomed such efforts. UNITED STATES UNCONVE NTIONAL WARFARE IN SOUTH VIETNAM (1967–1972) I-5. The successful U.S.-led UW effo rts in South Vietnam had their genesis in the Mike Force and Mobile Guerrilla Force concepts, whic h were initially corps-level reserve forces designed to react quickly to contingencies such as Viet Cong attacks on SF or Civilian Irregular Defens e Group camps. Instead of responding to the adversary and ceding the local initiative to them the newly developed Mobile Guerrilla Force would operate autonomously for extended periods of time to take the fight to areas of South Vietnam controlled by the Viet Cong. A crucial difference between the Mobil e Guerrilla Forces and their predecessors was operational control. An SF corps-level commander direc tly controlled the force, instead of a conventional corps commander in each of the four corps of South Vi etnam. The United States designed the Mobile Guerrilla Forces for extended operations , including long-range reconnaissance patrolling and ambushing, to fight the Viet Cong using their own tactics against them. Com prised of any combination of Vietnamese, Montagnard (tribal hill peoples), and ethnic Cambodians, these forces were led by U.S. an d/or South Vietnamese SF personnel. Operating largely in sparsely populate d areas, the Mobile Guerrilla Forces combined cultural awareness; local knowledge and support; U.S. supply, mobility, and firepower; and guerrilla tactics offensively and succe ssfully against the Viet Cong. UNITED STATES UNCONVE NTIONAL WARFARE IN THE SOVIET-AFGHAN WAR (1981–1989) I-6. Not all offensive UW efforts involve the United States working with indigenous forces directly, as was the case with U.S. support to Afghan Mujahideen forces during the Soviet-Afghan War. Initially, the United States funneled financial support for the Afghan fighters from other gove rnment agencies through the intelligence service of Pakistan. The Pakistani Inter-Servic e Intelligence maintained direct links with a number of Mujahideen leaders and dispensed the funds to favored groups so that t hey could buy arms and other supplies. In addition, some of these Afghan gr oups maintained training bases and safe areas within Pakistan. Although financial support was important to sustaining the Muj ahideen, one of the key turning points in the war occurred when the United States and the British introduced sh oulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, such as Stinger and Blowpipe, into the conflict. The Mujahideen we re effective at ambushing the largely road-bound motorized and mech anized Soviet forces. Soviet airpower, especi ally in the form of helicopter transports and gunships, inflicted serious losses on Mujahidee n forces. The introduction of man-portable surface-to-air missiles severely constr ained the Soviet use of their airpower. Continued"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"A Historical Survey of Unconventional Warfare 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 I-3 numbers of casualties on the ground, as well as mounting domestic opposition to th e war, convinced Soviet leaders to withdraw from Afghanistan. The United St ates was able to achieve its goals by waging UW through third-party actors without directly confronting the Soviet Union. UNITED STATES UNCONVE NTIONAL WARFARE IN AFGHANISTAN (2001–2002) I-7. Experience in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 demonstrates that waging UW need not be prolonged, costly undertakings. Waging UW can quickly and effi ciently achieve policy goals if the conditions for success are right. In this specific case, a standing indigenous force was al ready in existence. The forces of the Northern Alliance, although somewhat demoralized from previous l osses, were armed and many were combat veterans, including some who had fought against the Soviets. The intro duction of American military and paramilitary advisors and resources wa s critical in defeating and scattering Taliban and al-Qaeda forces in less than four months. Conventional force options would have take n too long to implement and, according to at least one accou nt, CIA Director George Tenet suggested more unconventional uses of force including UW. Supported by Army and Air Force SO A assets, USA SF teams conducted two primary missions in the subsequent UW campaign. The fi rst was political in nature and involved close liaison with Northern Alliance factio n commanders to prevent jealousy and rivalries from adversely affecting the campaign. A key to the success of the SF te ams was their cultural sensitivity and willingness to engage the Afghan and Uzbek leaders on their terms, creating considerable trust between U.S. and Northern Alliance forces. The second mission was military in nat ure and involved combat advice and leadership, C2, and precise fires against Taliban strong points and key force concentrations. The flexibility and adaptability of joint SO teams, connect ed to awe-inspiring leve ls of firepower, greatly boosted Northern Alliance confidence and, in one particular case, led to the first horse-mounted cha rge against armored forces in over sixty years. Alt hough the character of the campaign changed, from overthrowing the Taliban regime to stabilizing the country and chasing the Taliban and al-Qaeda remnants, the success of the U.S. UW campaign is undeniable. It also underscores the necessity of achieving a close working relationship with indigenous forces based on trust and mutual co mpetence. UNITED STATES UNCONVENTIO NAL WARFARE IN IRAQ (2003) I-8. Experience in the early stages of OIF in 2003 demonstrates that waging UW continues to have utility in the present global environment and in the context of ongoing major comba t operations. Elements of the 10th SFG(A) were infiltrated by SO F aircraft from the 353d SOW ac ross denied airspace after Turkey refused U.S. passage over its border in the opening st ages of the conflict. Once the 10th SFG(A) Soldiers successfully infiltrat ed Kurdistan in northern Iraq and linked up with Kurdish peshmerga units, the anticipated second operational front was achieved using initially unanti cipated methods. The SF Soldiers’ presence acted as a force multiplier by providing evidence of the poli tical support desired by the Kurds. Thus emboldened, Kurdish forces with SF support tie d down Hussein’s entire northern army. In addition, the SF Soldiers provided and reinforced the legitimacy of U.S. support to Kurdish aspirations and provided additional legitimacy to Kurdish forces’ participation in the larger coalition effort. Moreover, seeing that the second front established despite its objections, Turkey eventually rele nted and allowed subsequent border crossings to reinforce the effort. This example illustrates that the ability to conduct UW not only can support the larger conventional operation but also can use national strategy to achieve second- and third-order effects that are sign ificant, practical, and timely.

It is common for definitions to evolve, and ARSO F have recently refined the definition below to highlight the essentials of UW and eliminate everything that is nonessential. Words matter. In this era of definitional and conceptual change, ARSOF must be unified with a clear and co ncise understanding of the UW core task. The UW definition is operations conducted by, with, or through irregular forces in support of a resistance movement, an insurgency, or conventional milita ry operations. PREVIOUS DEFINITIONS FO R UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE J-2. The initial doctrinal concept for the United States to conduct UW lies with the creation of the OSS. Doctrine generally defined UW in terms of guerrilla and covert operat ions in enemy-held or influenced territory. In August 1950, the Dictionary of United States Army Terms defined “partisan warfare” as an “Activity carried on against an enemy by people who are devoted adherents to a cause, but who are not members of organized and recognized military forces. It includes gue rrilla action, passive resistance by underground groups, espionage, sabotage, and propaganda.” (Special Regulation 350-5-1.) J-3. In 1951, the Army consolidated its UW assets under the Office of Psychologica l Warfare. It was then that the Army published the first two manuals for the conduct of SO. They were FM 31-21, Organization and Conduct of Guerrilla Warfare , and FM 31-20, Operations Against Guerrilla Forces . J-4. FM 31-21 (October 1951) defined “guerrilla warfare” as “Operations carried out b y small independent forces, generally in the rear of the enem y, with the objective of harassing, delaying, and disrupting military operations of the enemy. The term is sometimes l imited to the military operations and tactics of small forces whose objective is to inflict casualties and damage upon the enemy rather than to seize or defend terrain. The extensive use of surprise and an emphasis o n the avoidance of casualties characterize these operations. The term includes orga nized and directed passive resistance, espionage, assassination, sabotage and propaganda, and, in so me cases, ordinary combat. Guerrilla warfare is ordinarily carried on by irregular or partisan forces; however, regular forces t hat have been cut off behind enemy lines or have infiltrated into the en emy rear areas may use guerrilla tactics.” J-5. FM 31-21 (October 1951) also noted, “Guerrilla warfare...is capable of gain ing political and economic decisions.” J-6. In March 1955, FM 31-21, Guerrilla Warfare , stated, “The broad aims of guerrilla strategy are to lessen the enemy’s combat effectiveness; delay and di srupt operations of the enem y forces; and weaken the morale and will to resist of a hostile military force.” J-7. In August 1955, FM 31-20, Special Forces Group (which superseded FM 31-20, February 1951), stated, “UW consists of the interrelated fields of gu errilla warfare, escape an d evasion, and subversion against hostile states.” J-8. In May 1958, FM 31-21, Guerrilla Warfare and Special Forces Operations (which superseded FM 31-21, March 1955, and FM 31-20, August 1955), st ated, “Guerrilla warfare comprises that part of UW which is conducted by relatively small groups employing offensive tactics to re duce enemy combat effectiveness, industrial capacity, and morale. Guerrilla operations are normally conducted in enemy-controlled territory by units organized on a military basis.

In May 1961, FM 31-15, Operations Against Irregular Forces , stated, “The term irregular, used in combinations such as irregular forces, irregular activ ities, and counter-irregular operations, is used in the broad sense to refer to all types of nonconventional forces and operat ions. It includes guerrilla, partisan, insurgent, subversive, resistance, terrorist, revolutionary, and simila r personnel, organizations, and methods. Irregular activities include acts of milita ry, political, psychological, and economic nature, conducted predominately by inhabitants of a nation for the purpose of eliminatin g or weakening the authority of the local government or occupying power, and using primarily irregular an d informal groupings and measures.” J-10. In September 1961, FM 31-21, Guerrilla Warfare and Special Forces Operations (which superseded FM 31-21, May 1958) stated, “UW consists of the in terrelated fields of guerrilla warfare, evasion and escape, and subversion against hostile states (resistance). UW operations are conducted in enemy-controlled territory by predominately indigenous personnel, usually suppo rted and directed in varying degrees by an external source.” J-11. In June 1965, FM 31-21, Special Forces Operations (which superseded FM 31-21, September 1961) stated, “UW includes the three interre lated fields of guerrilla warfare, evasion and escape, and subversion. UW operations are conducted within enemy or enemy-controlled territory by predominately indigenous personnel, usually directed and supported in varying degrees by an exter nal force.” J-12. The broadest classic conceptions of UW doctrine did not apply to COI N situations. However, select UW tactics and techniques—such as establishing in telligence nets and methods to gain support of the population and combat techniques, such as raids and ambushes—had obvious applic ation to COIN—a growing concern during the Vietnam conflict. J-13. In December 1965, FM 31-20, Special Forces Operational Techniques (which superseded FM 31-20, October 1961) omitted a direct definition of UW from the manual. However, by the early 1960s, definitions began to take more of an “insurgent” nature, whereby UW expanded to include “for ces [that] may have political aspirations inimical to our own.” The February 1969 issue of FM 31-21, Special Forces Operations (which superseded FM 31-21, June 1965), changed this idea. FM 31-21, Fe bruary 1969, included the following definitions and amplifications: “UW includes the three related fields of guerrilla warfare, evasion and esc ape, and subversion, conducted within hostile areas by predominatel y indigenous personnel, usually supported and directed in varying degrees by an external source. UW consists of mil itary, political, psychological, or economic actions of covert, clandestine, or overt nature w ithin areas under the actual or potential control or influence of a forc e or state whose interests and objectives are inimical to those of the United States. These actions are conducte d unilaterally by U.S. resources or in conjunction with indigenous assets, and avoid formal military confr ontation.” “The UW Concept. UW is conducted to exploit military, political, econo mic, or psychological vulnerabilities of an enemy. It is implemented by providing support and direction to indigenous resistance forces where appropriate, or by unilateral operations of U.S. U W forces. Its conduct involves the application of guerrilla warfare and se lected aspects of subversion, political warfare, economic warfare, and psychological operati ons in support of national objectives.” “UW Operations. UW operations may be covert, clandestine, or overt in nature. C overt operations are conducted in such a manner as to conceal the identity of the sponsor, while clandestine operations place emphasi s on concealment of the operati on rather than the identity of the sponsor. Ov ert operations do no t try to conceal either the ope ration or the identity of the sponsor. In an established theater of operations in which significant gr ound operations by conventional U.S. military force will be undertake n, UW is conducted primarily to complement, support, or extend conventional operations. Within geographical are as under enemy control or influence, to which conventional U.S. forces w ill not be deployed, UW may be conducted as an economy-of-force measure, and to reduc e or dissipate the enemy potential.” J-14. In February 1971, FM 31-20, Special Forces Operational Techniques (which superseded FM 31-20, December 1965) continued to omit a direct definition of UW from the manual. J-15. In December 1974, FM 31-21, Special Forces Operations , stated, “UW is defined as a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations conducted in enemy, enemy-held, enemy-controlled, or"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"An Outline History of the Unconventional Warfare Definitio n 30 September 2008 FM 3-05.130 J-3 politically sensitive territory. UW includes, but is not li mited to, the interrelated fields of guerrilla warfare, evasion and escape, subversion, sabotage, direct ac tion missions, and other operations of a low-visibility, covert, or clandestine nature. These interrelated aspect s of UW may be prosecuted singly or collectively by predominantly indigenous personnel, usually supported and directed in varying degrees by (an) external source(s) during all conditions of war or peace.” J-16. Also in December 1974, FM 31-21A, Special Forces Operations , expanded on the above definition by stating that “UW operations may be conducted against the external sponsor of an insurgent (movement in a host country), or against insurgent (movement in a host country), or ag ainst insurgent activities in a third country, which either willingly or unwillingly accepts the use of its territory by the insurgents for bases, movement, or actuary. Their purpose is to support or complement ID AD in the host country.” J-17. In April 1990, FM 31-20, Doctrine for Special Forces Operations , defined UW as “A broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations, norm ally of long duration, predominantly conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized, trained, equipped, support ed, and directed in varying degrees by an external source. It includes guerrilla wa rfare and other direct offensive, low-visibility, covert, or clandestine operations, as well as the indirect ac tivities of subversion, sabotage, intelligence collection, and evasion and escape.” J-18. In April 1998, JP 3-05, Doctrine for Joint Special Operations , essentially copied the above definition: UW is “a broad spectrum of military a nd paramilitary operations, no rmally of long duration, predominantly conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces who are organized, tra ined, equipped, supported, and directed in varying degrees by an ex ternal source. It includes guerrilla warfare and other direct offensive low-visibility, covert, or clandestin e operations, as well as the indirect activities of subversion, sabotage, intelligence activities, and evasion and esca pe.” J-19. In December 1998, FM 31-20 (Initial Draft), Doctrine for Special Forces Operations , added to the two definitions above stating— “UW is a broad spectrum of military and paramilitary operations, predom inantly conducted by indigenous or surrogate forces organized, trained, equipped, supported, an d directed in varying degrees by an external source. It includes guerrilla warfare and the indire ct activities of subversion, sabotage, intelligence activities, and unconventional assisted recovery (UAR). UW is the military and paramilitary aspect of an insurgency or ot her armed resistance movement. UW is thus a protracted political-military activity.” “Contemporary UW is significant for several reasons. Historically, SF has focused o n UW as an adjunct to a major theater of war. The new strate gic environment, however, requires SF to focus on UW during military operations other than war, especially as it relates t o UAR. Moreover, global urbanization dictates a shift in SF emphasi s from rural guerrilla warfare to all aspects of clandestine UW.” NONDOCTRINAL TERMS J-20. Other currently influential but nondoctrinal terms further complicate the go al of maintaining an up-to-date, authoritative, a nd clearly articulated ARSOF UW doctrine . Incorrect usage of doctrinal terms sows confusion and aggravates mission accomplishmen t. Incorrect usage of unapproved terms does so exponentially. Individuals throughout the government, academia, and the press so widely and often incorrectly use these terms that they demand a brief summary. J-21. One such imprecise term often confused for UW is “asymmetric warfare.” Despite the frequent usage of the term, JP 1-02 has no approved definition for it. “Symmetric warfare” assumes the legacy concept of two roughly equal nation-states who fight each other directly, using standing, uniformed armies, navies, and air forces. WWII countries and combats are a clas sic example. Asymmetric warfare is generally understood to be a conflict in which the strengths and sizes of the opponents do not mirror each other. The side with the conventional disadvantage is probably incapable of winni ng through direct, conventional warfare. It must seek victory through other methods that exploit weakness es in the superior conventional power’s capacity to prevail. Examples include the Maoist Peoples’ War against the Imperial Japanese Army, the Vietnamese dau trahn strategy in the First and Second Indochina Wars, and al-Qaeda’s tactics in"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Appendix J J-4 FM 3-05.130 30 September 2008 the WOT. In these cases, political organization, pros elytizing, and PSYOP were fundamental to their effectiveness. J-22. Although symmetric warfare is the loose conceptual equivalent of conventional warfare, it is not an approved doctrinal definition. The discussion of “as ymmetry,” however, is obviously useful to the characterization of IW, UW, and CO IN. IW does include the concept of seeking asymmetric advantages. IW also uses terms such as “asymmetric applica tions” of TTP and drawing attention to “asymmetric activities.” ARSOF—and its joint, interagency, and multinational partners—must therefore understand and use the unapproved term “asymmetric warfare” with care. It is not sy nonymous with UW. J-23. A second term often used in discussions of UW, IW, and COIN is so-called fou rth-generation warfare, or 4GW. 4GW proponents maintain that the world is in a new era , or generation, of warfare. The first generation was characterized by massed manpower, the second by firepowe r, and the third by maneuver. 4GW proponents claim that the new generation is characterized by the use of all instruments of power—not just the military—to defeat the will of enemy decision makers. 4GW has its detractors. 4GW borrows heavily from concepts previously developed by Mao, the Vietnamese, and others. It is not accepted DOD doctrine or terminology and is not a synonym for UW. J-24. A third term that is sometimes mistakenly confused with UW is “un restricted warfare.” This term refers to the title of a monograph written by two army co lonels from the Peoples’ Republic of China. They advocate “a multitude of means, both military and particularly nonm ilitary, to strike at the United States during times of conflict.” Hacking into Web sites, targeting financial institutions, conducting terrorism, using the media, and conducting urban warfare are among the methods propo sed. The first rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules. Stro ng countries would not use the same approach against weak countries because “strong countries make the rules, while rising ones break them and exploit loopholes.” J-25. The similarity of these ideas to those in the previous terms is unmist akable. Whether or not the authors break any new ground or establish a new theory is debatable. Their monograph has generated interest in the West primarily for what it may signify in Peoples’ Rep ublic of China strategic thinking— such ideas could not be published without some official sanction in the often inscru table Chinese government. ARSOF Soldiers—and their joint, intera gency, and multinational partners—should be aware of unrestricted warfare, but they must understand that the term is not synonymous w ith the aforementioned terms, is not approved doctrine, and has a very specific international context and usage.
