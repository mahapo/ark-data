Is America a place or a state of mind? The British may love their language, and the French may love their gold, but Americans love more than anything to argue over who they really are. And in all that time, and all that arguing— from the dueling essays of Jefferson and Ham ilton, to the confused politics of the Reform Party and Pat Buch anan—the American story has ultimately never strayed very far from the plotline that has energized it from the start. You may devote a lifetime to peelin g back the onion skins of the American Experience, as so many scholars have done, and no matter where you stop you will always enc ounter the same basic question that frames our history: In a democracy, what are the limits to legitimate power? At its core, that is the question that informs The Iron Triangle: In side the Secret World of the Carlyle Group—-just as it eventually seems to inform our understanding of everyt hing that ever happens in American public life, from the XYZ A ffair to the Pentagon Papers. It is why one generation of Americans enacts the Sherman Antitrust Act, and a later generation eviscerates it. At the start of the 1950s, a screenwriter named Ring Lardner, Jr . was imprisoned as a Communist sympathizer; a generation later he was lionized in Hollywood as the screenwriter of M*A*S*H."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FOREWORD Of such moments is the history of this country even tually told, as Americans engage in the ceaseless pursuit of midcourse corrections to get where we wa nt to go as a nation without becoming a tyranny in the process. When Richard Nixon lamented the nation's seeming obsession with \"wallowing in Waterg ate,\" he missed the key point: As a nation and a peop le, we really had no other choice. Now, in the winter of 2003, with America's wrath once again poised to strike down Iraq, a palpable sense is abroad in the land— not shared by all, but shared by enough—that we have somehow drawn a line in the sand where we never really intended to stand. How did we get to this moment anyw ay? In the visible mechanism of political cause and effect, part of what's happenin g feels hidden from view. We see the cause, and we see the effect. But the assembly of gears that transmits the power seems off somewhere else, in another room. It is the work of scholarship—and in particular, of that uniquely American kind of contemporary schola rship that we call investigative journalism—to enter thos e darkened rooms and sw itch on the light so that all may see what is actually taking place. When the work is done well, and the message is true, we fi nd ourselves in a diorama we never imaged could exist. One thinks in that regard of Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives, or more recen tly, and on a different stage entirely, Wise and Ross's Invisible Government. At other times, the exposes connect invisible dots, and in fa irly short order are deservedly consigned to the ash bin of histor y as conspiracy theory. (Want to find yourself standing alone at a co cktail party? Then try suggesting that you have it on good authority that the Trilateral Commission actually runs the world.) Briody's scholarship will meet no such fate, for not only are the facts of The Iron Triangle accurat e, but the picture they present is also true. And just as Invisible Government in 1964 helped bring depth to our understanding of some of the missi ng gears that soon drove America into the jungles and highlands of Indochina , so too does The Iron Triangle introduce us to th e men (and they are mostly just that) whose role in the geopolitics of the Middle East is now only glimpsed fleetingly, and never by design."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Foreword In the foreign policy apparatus of Washington, the Carlyle Group inhabits one of th e most darkened rooms of all—hiding in plain sight in offices a mere five minutes' wa lk down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Into this room, Bri ody has wandered uninvited and flipped on the light, to reveal the en tire spin-cycle apparatus of post- public-sector employment that keeps the top men of successive administrations still gainfully empl oyed in the fields they know best (typically aerospace and defense) once the boss has vacated the White House and return ed to private life. In this room, you'll meet the crud e and brashly entertaining original founder of the Carlyle Group, Stephen Norris, a one-time hotel executive for the Marr iott Corporation, who figured out how to exploit a late-1980s tax break passed for some Eskimos whose businesses kept failing, and parlayed it into a gimmick for monetizing the value of failure itself, and then marketing it as tax loss carry- forwards. From this gimmick sprang the Carlyle Group—named by Norris and some chums after an organizing meet ing they'd held in New York's Carlyle Hotel, as if the Group we re nothing more than a piece of faux Regency furniture in need of a credential. In these pages, you'll meet the relentlessly over-achieving David Rubenstein, now no longer the boy wonder bullet-biter of the Carter White House, where he held the title of Deputy Domestic Policy Assistant at the age of 27, a nd was said to have eaten three squares a day, for the en tire four years, on junk food from White House vending machines. You'll also come face-to-face with hatchet-faced Frank Carlucci (\"Spooky Frank\"), a man with a shadowy past including allegations that he began his career in the CIA with a foiled attempt to assassinate Patrice Lumumba in the Eisenhower years—something that Spooky Frank denies. You'll see him rise to de puty director of the CIA late in the Carter years, then \"retire\" ear ly in the first term of Ronald Reagan's administration to beco me head of Sears World Trade—a company with a business that consis ted, intriguingly, of neither deals nor revenues. Then, drawn back to Washington by the Great Revolving Door of government, Carl ucci took a seat on the National Security Council, once agai n for Ronald Reagan, then"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" FOREWORD hopped over to Defense, finally spinning back through the door and into the private sector. At the e nd of Reagan's second term, he was settling behind his desk at the Carlyle Group. You'll meet such figures as George Bush, Sr.'s one-time secretary of state, James Baker, who also joined the team, and even the ex- president himself, now a se nior advisor to the Group. And, for the first time anywhere, you'll go behind the scenes to see what this group really does as a \"business.\" How it nails down deals, whose arms get twisted, and why. On the light side, you'll encounter comic relief figures like Prince Alwal eed bin Talal, who has promoted himself around the world as a top me mber of the Saudi royal family but has proved to be a spectacularly inept investor, pouring vast sums of Saudi money into dot-corn stocks at the top of the boom. More darkly, you'll enter the astounding—and until now almost entirely hidden—world of the Vinnell Corporation, which has been training the Saudi Armed Forces in how to protect th eir country's oil fields since the mid-1970s. There are now an almost unbelievable 45,000 private mercenaries working for Vinnell and outfits like it in place in the coun try. Vinnell was a Carlyle Group subsidiary from 1992 to 1997. What is one to make of all this? Certainly enough to want to know more, which is why a book such as The Iron Triangle is such an important contribution: It puts the subject in play. A half century ago, Douglas MacArthur, having been summoned back to Washington from Korea by his Commander in Chie f, Harry Truman, and relieved of his command over a dispute rega rding his conduc t of the war, stood before a joint session of Cong ress and declared, in one of the most memorable moments in American life, that \"old soldiers never die, they just fade away . . .\" af ter which he retired to the penthouse suite of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York and was rarely seen in public again.

But even agai nst this extravag ant setting, the Carlyle Hotel stands out. Its tower rises unapologetically into the sky, lording over Central Park and domin ating the skyline around it. The blue-blood interior with lush carpe ting and hushed tones perfectly suits its high-end clientele. It is a place for those accustomed to success and comfortable with luxury. In a city full of opulent hotels, it is among royalty. So it is altogether fitting that the Carlyle Group would assimilate the name of this regal re sidence when ba nding together in the summer of 1987. At the time, co-fou nders Stephen Norris and David Rubenstein met often at the ho tel on 76th Street and Madison Avenue.

Today, the Carlyle Group is a stor y of dealings inside the \"Iron Triangle,\" the place where the world' s mightiest military intersects with high-powered politics and big business. It is a company whose history includes ties to CIA cover-ups and secret arms deals, and an astounding trail of corporate cronyi sm. By making defense buyouts the cornerstone of its business strategy, Carlyle now finds itself the beneficiary of the larg est increase in defense spending in history. Indeed the stars seem to have aligne d perfectly for Carlyle, in just 15 short years. With the ascension of Ge orge W. Bush to the presidency, the White House is now full of ex -Carlyle employees, friends, and business partners. And with the newly fattened defense budget, Carlyle has been able to extract massive profits from its defense holdings, like United Defense, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It may be tough times for America, but as Bette Midler might say, everything's coming up Carlyle. While the company flew well u nder the radar screen for the first decade of its life, lately success has not come without scrutiny for the Carlyle Group. After all, it's hard to remain anonymous when your employee roster includes names like George Herbert Walker Bush, James Baker III, John Major, and Arthur Levitt.

But no matter how deep your susp icions run, the Carlyle Group warrants close examination. That a company like the Carlyle Group even exists is testament to the irresistible temptation for ex- politicians to cash in on their time as public serv ants, in ways that to some seem less than scrupulous. The Carlyle Group has established a number of firsts in America, including: • It is the first time a former pres ident has toiled on behalf of a defense contractor. • It is the first time that a former president advised his son, while holding office, on foreign policy decisions that directly impacted both of thei r financial fortunes. • It is the first private-equity firm of its kind to be based in Washington, DC, rather than the traditional haunts of New York, or even Chicago. • It is the first company to assemble a cast of characters that even X-Files writers couldn't have dreamed up. Besides the im pressive domestic roster of political heavyweights, Fidel Ramos, former president of the Philippines is a senior advisor. Park Tae-joon, former prime mini ster of South Korea was also a senior advisor. Former Thai Premier Anan Panya- rachun also worked for the company. If the thought of all of these men working together outside the fishbowl of international politic s makes you uneasy, you are not alone.

Coincidence a nd circumstance only go so far in explaining the unbridled success of this company. Connections, cronyism, and cunning fill in the ga ps. Far more disconcerting to the discriminating investor is the fact th at Carlyle has beco me the model for a new generation of investment banking in which former politicians are brought in at high- level positions to butter up investors, foreign heads of state, and business partners. Why else would Los Angeles-based Metropolitan West Financial appoint Al Gore, with zero professional investment experience, its vice chairman? Investment banks are learning that the Carlyle model pays. But it is Carlyle's particular st yle of investing that has raised eyebrows. Concentrating on heavil y regulated indu stries like de- fense, telecommunications, energ y, and health care, Carlyle is betting that it can predict future trends in government spending and policy, or influe nce them outright. And by hiring former sec- retaries of defense, ex-presidents, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commissio n, and the former chai rman of the Federal Communication Commission, they are in a position to do either.

His time with the Carlyle Group, ending abruptly in January 1995, was marked by tension, competition, and conflicting egos. He is a man with casual disregard of those with whom he is conversing. His eyes flit around the room. He looks at ev erything but you. He talks freely, with no fear of consequence, and rarely pauses for a retort. He talks over you. Athletic, fit, handsom e, and with a healthy taste for the good life, Norris speaks longingly, even boastfully, of his time with the Carlyle Group, fondly recalling his blockbuster deals with rich Saudi princes and Fortune 500 companies. He is, and always has been, a man that swings for the fences. In late 1986, Norris, then an exec utive with Marriott's mergers and acquisitions group and a tax whiz , got wind of a little-known tax loophole that allowed Eskimo-owned companies in Alaska to sell their losses to profitable companies. The origin of the loophole dated back to 1971, when Alas kan natives arrived at a unique settlement with the federal government over ownership claims of Alaskan land. Typically, when Native Americans sued the U.S. government over the atrocities committed during the nation's \"manifest destiny\" era, the settlements revolved around land, otherwise known as reservations . The logic went that if the government could return some por tion of the land they stole in claiming America for themselves, the irreparable cultural damage done to Native Americans in the process would somehow be forgotten. But the Eskimos we ren't buying it. Unlike Native Americans in the lower 48 states, Alaska's natives eschewed the traditional award of land reserv ations. Instead, the Alaskans chose cash. Under a unique settlement, Alaskan natives were al- lowed to set up native-run corpora tions to invest and manage the money they had been awarded. In the end, the Eskimos and other native Alaskans ended up with $962 million to manage as they saw fit. They al so managed to negotiate for 44 million acres"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Politician, the Businessman, and the Unlucky Eskimos of land on which to run their businesses. It was the price paid to them for decades of oppression, and they took it. Because of some bureaucratic foot-dragging and truly unfortunate timing, the newly formed corporations missed out on Alaska's boom time in the mid-1970 s. Fishing, timber, and oil, three of the local industries most companies were set up around, experienced major downturns. Many of the companies fell prey to mismanagement, investing in foolish pursuits like tire manu- facturers, concrete plants, and hot els. Even though they had chosen their own fate, the owners of the companies felt they had been set up to fail. More than 180 companie s had been formed out of the settlement. Only one managed to c onsistently turn a profit. It was a total disaster. The companies soon found themselves facing huge losses, and limited options for turning thi ngs around. In 1983, Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens worked to save hi s floundering constituency by incorporating a clause in the 1984 tax bill that allowed the Alaskan-owned companies to leverage their losses by selling them to profitable companies looking for a break on their taxes. Essentially, if an Alaskan compa ny lost $10 million in a fiscal year, they would sell the losses fo r $7 million in much-needed cash. The buyer would then write the losses off against its profits, getting a $10 million tax credit for just $7 million. Everyone's happy, except, of course, the government . Norris smelled money. But he needed help from someone. Someone with exceptional connections. Someone that knew everybody, including some Alaskan Eskimos. Someone like David Rubenstein. Rubenstein: Carlyle's Beating Heart Ask enough people abou t David Rubenstein, a nd you start to hear the same descriptors over and over: brilliant, driven, tireless."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"4 THE IRON TRIANGLE Norris still maintains an objectiv e respect for Rubenstein, with whom he joined forces in 1986. Rubenstein had been toiling as a Washington, DC, lawyer for six year s with the mergers and acquisitions groups at Shaw, Pittman, Potts &: Trowbridge and G. William Miller & Co. when Norris came calling. Norris, who often transitions seamlessly between utterly eloquent and outright crude, calls Rubenstein \"indefatig able, \"indomitable,\" a nd \"f**king brilliant.\" Rubenstein would go on to beco me the very heart and soul of Carlyle, driving the company forw ard through clashing egos and countless near-scandals. After graduating from the University of Chicago Law School in 1973, Rubenstein worked his way up the political ranks with blazing speed. At the tender age of 27, he became the deputy do- mestic policy assistant to Presiden t Jimmy Carter. He was the first person in the office in the morni ng, and the last to leave. One of the most widely circulated stories about Rubenstein is that he survived solely on vending machine fare during his time at the White House, a claim he does not refute. He strongly believed in the nobility of being a public servan t. He was young, idealistic, and most of all, innocent. In the spring of 1980, Rubenstein filed a memo to the president late one night. Before he left to go home—some thought that he was actually living in the White House due to his late hours—he remembered something he had intended to add to the memo, and went into the president's offi ce to fetch the document. After shuffling through some papers in the president's inbox, he found the memo, amended it, and return ed it to the stack. The next morning, President Carter questio ned Rubenstein about his late- night foray into his office, asking him pointedly and repeatedly what he had seen while he was there. Rubenstein truthfully told the president that he simply got his memo, and then returned it, seeing nothing in the process.

The story, related to me by Norris, demonstrates Rubenstein's early naivete. It also foreshadows the paranoia that some say has grown inside him over the past 20 years in Washington, DC. \"He sees conspiracies,\" says Norris. After Carter lost to Reagan in 1981, Rubenstein was released into the world of high-priced beltway lo bbyists. It was a business that insulted Rubenstein's renowned intelligence and underutilized his many talents. His distaste for the wo rk was captured in a 1993 article in New Republic, wher e he was quoted as saying, \"I found it demeaning, it was legalized bribery. \" His opinion of lobbying would change later in his career. Rubenstein would soon be deli vered from the tedium of Washington influence peddling, when Norris, while still working for Marriott, contacted him, lo oking for a way to cash in on what would come to be known within Carlyle as the Great Eskimo Tax Scam. Norris' entire job at the time was to scour tax law and find ways to save Marriott million s. He hired Rubenstein and William Barr, the man who would go on to become attorney general from 1991 to 1993, from Shaw, Pitt man, Potts & Trowbridge, a Washington law firm that had represented Marriott on the Hill in the past. Along with his relentless work ethic, Rubenstein had also garnered a reputation for his extensive Rolodex. When Norris asked him if he knew any native Alaskans, Rubenstein had no problem coming up with some names. Marriott ended up paying Rubenstein and Barr a seven-figure fee for their help in saving them a bundle on their taxes in 1986. Norris, after reading the tax bi ll closely, decided there was a much greater opportunity here than just this one-shot deal. He figured if Rubenstein and Barr could make out so handsomely for their limited role in facilitating Marriott's tax relief, he could, too. Norris left Marriott and set up shop in Seattle to pursue the deals, all the while talking to investors about opening up a little business of his own."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE IRON TRIANGLE Before long, Norris and Rubenstein were flying Eskimos into Washington, DC, butteri ng them up, and brokering deals between them and profitable American companies.

Norris and Rubenstein took a 1 per cent cut of the transactions and sent an estimated $1 billion th rough the loophole, A cottage industry had been born. After cl earing close to $10 million, Norris and Rubenstein recognized the ongoi ng potential of the business, and decided to incorporate. For corporate representation, the two hired none other than Ron Astin of the venerable Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins. (Astin would late r find himself testifying before Congress about offshore partnerships he had helped set up for Enron.) With the crew in place, liabilities limited, and money coming in the door, th e boys were ready to make something of themselves. All they needed now was a name. During this time, Norris and Rubenstein frequented the Carlyle Hotel in New York. Norri s loved the place. It was the kind of over- the-top lavishness he couldn't get en ough of. It had a high-roller feel to it. His hero, Andre Me yer, the legendary head of investment bank Lazard Freres, had lived th ere for years. Norris felt the name lent the company a silk-stocking air. Afte r selling Rubenstein on the idea, the Carlyle Group was born. That the Carlyle Group was formed out of a temporary tax loophole, which was eliminated a year late r, is utterly appropriate. David Rubenstein, as dedicated a public se rvant as there ever was, saw fit to found his company on a scheme that denied the federal government close to $1 billion in taxes. It was the first of many ironies that would compromise Rubenstein's political roots as his career with Carlyle progressed.

A discrepancy between \"hard\" and \"s oft\" losses arose. Corporate appraisers took liberties in estimating the loss in value of certain goods, like timber and oil. Suddenly everyone in Alaska had losses for sale. It was a bonanza for accountants. Though no charges were ever filed, the case portends the current corporate malfeasance in America, in which companies inflate revenues and earnings through marginally legal accounting. It bears mentioning that in cert ain cases, the tax loophole actually did what it was intended to do. Some Alaskan companies took the capital they received an d reinvested, saving th emselves from certain bankruptcy. Finally, however, just before Carlyle could complete a $500 million deal with a company called Cook Inlet, the government had seen en ough of its money wast ed, and sewed up the hole.

Everyone was getting rich and Rubenstein was itching to get a piece of the action. He woul d later confess to a reporter that \"I thought I had a pretty good IQ myself, and people were making a lot more money than me who I thought mayb e weren't so smart.\" The most important thing for buyout firms, otherwise known as private equity firms, is raising ca pital. The more money a given firm can raise, the more successful it can be. Like a mutual fund, a buyout fund collects money from a number of sources—wealthy individuals, institution al investors, pension funds—then invests it on their behalf. But instead of inve sting in stocks, buyout funds buy companies, with the intention of turning them around and selling them for a profit. Typically, the companies are bought with a mix of capital and debt, somewhat m itigating the risk of the buyer. Hence, the leveraged buyout, or LBO, nickname. The companies are then held in a portfolio, or fund, which usually has a target market or theme. It can be a dangerous form of investing, open only to the extremely wealthy. Minimum investments in a given fund are usually no less than $1 m illion, and returns are generally expected to be more than 25 percent, usually within 10 years, sometimes less. Downside can be that much and more. LBOs are not for the faint of heart. The Carlyle Group based themselves in Washington, DC, instead of the more traditional buy- out firm haunts of New York or Chicago, a move that surprised ma ny in the business. Arthur Mil-tenberger, then chief investment officer of the Mellon Foundati on, would tell Forbes at the time, \"I was intrigued by a merchant bank based in Washington, DC, because foreigners have to come to Washington.\" Upon incorporation, Carlyle hardly re gistered a blip on the radar of older, more established buyout firms like Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts and Fortsmann Little."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Politician, the Businessman, and the Unlucky Eskimos It was clear from the outset that wh at the Carlyle Group had to offer that was different from its more incumbent competitors was its access. Newspapers hera lded the rise of a ne w breed of dealmaker: the access capitalist. Indeed, the Carlyle Group's first deals reflected the relationships that its founders had fostered. Carlyle took a $35 million stake in Consolidated Entertainment, a company that was part-owned by Gerald M. Rafshoon, a former Carter administration advisor. The company was pl anning a six-hour miniseries for HBO called \"The Great Satan,\" a detailed account of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Iranian hostage crisis, a topic that Rubenstein knew all to well. But it soon became apparent that it takes more to succeed in the world of high finance than a political pedigree and a bunch of swell friends. The company stumbled its way to a disastrous early record, overpaying for ill-advised investments, and gett ing beat out by more nimble competitors on the only deals that had potential. In 1987, Carlyle launched a takeover bi d of the Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's, only to be outbi d by Foodmaker. Then again in 1988, Carlyle began accumulating shar es of Fairchild Industries, a Virginia-based defense contractor, only to be out-bid by Ban ner Industries, which up until that point had been in partner ship with Carlyle. It was a bruising introduction to the world of high finance. Though the company made about $10 million in stock profits on both deals combined, they were discovering the hard way how the leveraged buyout game was played.

Close friends with George H. W.

But the excitement wa s to be short-lived. Less than a month after Malek's appointment, scandal erupted in Washington. In early September 1988, the Washingt on Post reported that in July 1971, operating under instructions from President Nixon, Malek had compiled figures on the number of Jews working within the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (B LS). Nixon, then at the height of his paranoia, believed that a \"Jew ish cabal\" within the Bureau was undermining him, releasing unfavorable and inaccurate data to the public to damage his approval ratings. Malek, in a memo dated July 27, 1971, reported that 13 of the top 35 BLS officials were indeed Jewish, and provided their names to Nixon. In the months following, Chief Economist Peter Henle and Director of Current Employee Analysis Harold Goldstein were reassigned to lower level positions within the BLS. At the time these events occurred, nothing was known of Nixon's anti-Se mitic sentiments. It wasn't until 17 years later that the inci dent came back to haunt Malek, when Washington Post reporters uncovered the fateful memo while digging through old files from the Nixon administration. After the news broke, Malek re signed as RNC chairman imme- diately and admitted to compiling the figures for the president, but not for reassigning the two promin ent Jews. The damage had been done though. Malek knew that he would be labeled an anti-Semite. He knew the public had no tolera nce for that kind of ethnically fueled politicking. He knew that he was in danger and he knew immediately where to go.

Malek was by far the best connected of the nascent company. He brought with him deep relationships with the Bush family, the Saudi Arabian royal family, and countless Washington insiders. Even with his freshly tainted reputation, he would go on to spearhead several big deals for the company, including an ill- fated buyout of Caterair, the Texas-based airline catering company that would hire George W. Bush. Though Malek's stay at Carlyle would amount to nothing more than time on the lam, hiding out while the furor over his anti-Semitic actions died down, he did manage to set Carlyle up with a handful of high- powered Republican connections. He would soon return to public life to lead President George H. W. Bush's reelection campaign in 1991. But after Bush lost to William Jefferson Clinton, Malek found that he was no longer welcome at Carlyle. \"No one wanted him back, and it was very embarr assing for Fred not to have a place to land,\" says Norris. \"And it was wrong.\" Malek still harbors resentment over what he feels was mistreatment. \"His wife still hates me,\" says Norris. Though brief, Malek's time with Carlyle would ultimately change the face of the company foreve r. \"I brought a little more name recognition, a little more gray hair,\" recalled Malek in an interview for this book. He is quick to point out that he never joined the firm outright. \"I was off icing there, just a freelancer,\" he says.

Caterair may have b een a complete failure"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"14 THE IRON TRIANGLE by ordinary business standards, but the relationships cultivated therein were more than worth th e stinging financial losses. In Washington, it's not what you know, but who you know, and knowing George W. Bush, then son of the nation's president, was a valuable connection indeed. But getting an in with the president's son wasn't easy, and it all started when the man known simp ly as \"Mr. Marriott\" got a hankering to sell one of his businesses. J. W. Marriott is among the most highly regarded businessmen in the world. He has a proven track r ecord of deft management and strong leadership. His former employ ees, years after they've left the company, continue to refer to him as \"Mr. Marriott,\" out of sheer respect. He has been known to sense trends in the industry with uncanny prescience. So in 1989, wh en Mr. Marriott made it known that his company's airline catering division, then known as Marriott In-Flite Services, was on the bloc k, one had to suspect that he knew something the rest of the world didn't know. Nevertheless, a group of zealous Marriott execu tives went ahead with plans to buy the stagnating division from Ma rriott Corp. with the help of the newest merchant bank on the block: Carlyle Group. Originally formed in 1937, Marr iott In-Flite had c eased to be a growth area for Marriott by the late 1980s, and Mr. Marriott wanted out. Dan Altobello, who head ed the division within Marriott since 1982, decided that he wo uld spearhead a management-led leveraged buyout of In -Flite, meaning the curr ent employees of the division would raise the capital nece ssary to buy the business from Marriott. Altobello knew exactly who to call to structure the deal. In fact, he knew them quite well. Norris, Malek, and D'Aniello, were all former Marri ott executives and former co-workers of Altobello's, and toge ther they all got to work immediately on putting together a deal. Norris' role was to work the deal such th at Marriott's tax liab ilities were limited. Malek was needed to help Altobello manage the new independent company (this was a special request of Mr. Marriott)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Craterair 15 D'Aniello managed the relations hip with Merrill Lynch, which would provide a $250 million bridge loan to complete the deal, the last such deal Merrill Lynch would ever partake in. Negotiations progressed, capital was raised, an d then, $650 million later, in July 1989, Marriott In-Flite was sold to its employees and renamed Caterair. Carlyle retained a stake in the new company, as well as collecting a fee for structuring the deal. It would be the last major LBO of the 1980s, th e decade of LBOs. Caterair consisted of 150 different airline customers at 45 U.S. and 38 foreign airports. It had an army of 19,000 employees and revenues of $800 million in 1988. It was a very big deal. Malek and Altobello became co-chairmen and greeted the press with promises of expansion in interna tional markets, particularly the Soviet bloc. But it was not to be. Malek's Triangle Trade At the same time he was working to complete the Caterair deal, Fred Malek was also putting together the largest buyout ever in the airline industry: a $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest Airlines, then the country's fourth largest carrier . Malek worked with Al Checchi and Gary Wilson, two more former Marriott executiv es, to buy out Northwest, and in June 1989, just da ys before the Caterair deal was finalized, Malek had successfully co mpleted the Northwest deal. That Malek was working on two colo ssal deals simultaneously was disconcerting to the boys at Carlyle, particularly when they had cut out of the Northwest deal entirely. Just a year removed from his disgraceful exit from pu blic life on the Bush campaign trail, and Malek had multiple irons in the fire. (He was also helping George W. Bush to buy the Texas Rangers at th is time.) Controversy had slowed down Malek's political ambitions, but it did nothing to hinder his business pursuits. By October 1989, Malek had been named president and CEO of Northwest. The job"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"16 THE IRON TRIANGLE required that Malek a ssume responsibility for day-to-day operations at Northwest, meaning he could no longer devo te the time necessary to Caterair, and the burden of running the company fell solely to Altobello. But Malek was no fool. Though he wa s constantly distracted by his myriad responsibilities, he still had time to make some critical moves for Caterair. By 1990, Malek had decided that George W. Bush would make an excellent board member for Caterair. \"I began spending all my time on the Nort hwest deal, and when we did the Caterair deal, I thought he (Geo rge W. Bush) would be a good guy to be on that board,\" Malek told me. \"His office had been next to mine on [his father's] campaign, so I knew him real well. He was coming to Washington a lot anyway, and I thought he had a lot of business judgment and practical sense. I just thought he would be a good director.\" George W. Bush became a board member of Caterair in 1990, the year afte r the company was bought out. Up to that point, Bush had a decade's worth of experience in the oil industry, but nothing even resembling the service-oriented business of airline catering. But George W. Bush had far more valuable things to offer than direct business experience. His father was president of the United States at the time and one would think that had to be worth something, both to Malek personally and to Carlyle. In effect what Malek had constructed was his own personal triangle trade. Caterair did a sizeable business with Northwest. Northwest needed some help from the Bush administration on some regulatory issues, after Congress began questio ning the airline's near-monopoly status at certain hubs. Finally, Geor ge W. Bush needed to bolster his business resume, and Malek of cour se was close friends with his father. Between currying favor with the president and securing business for Caterair, Malek had killed two birds with one Bush. And that's how cronyism works. Despite Malek's public statemen ts about Bush being appointed because of his business acumen, one Caterair board member said the real reason that Bush was named to the board was to help"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Craterair 17 Malek out on with the regulatory is sues he was facing at Northwest. The board member also says th at Malek, Bush, and Alto-bello would often huddle together at Caterair board meetings, excluding the rest of the board. Bush's involvement in the day-today activities of Caterair was nominal at best. \"We all coveted his custom Texas Ranger's boots, signed by Nolan Ryan,\" says the board member, recalling what George W. Bush added to the board. \"He was really smart but not really enga ged in Caterair's business.\" The point at which arrangements like Caterair's break down is when the few individuals who control th e company are maneuvering so feverishly for their own personal gain, that the well-being of a company, and its 19,000 employees, is overlooked. Business went on that way for a ti me until the ai rline catering industry hit a wall that Caterair wa s ill prepared to climb. War in the Gulf, higher oil prices, and a nationwide recession combined to devastate revenues in the airline industry. Airlines started shutting their doors, facing bankruptcy. In 1991, alone, Caterair lost two of its best customers when both Pan Am and Eastern Air Lines stopped flying because of financial insolvency. Adding to Caterair's woes, airlines started aggressively cutting costs, and one of the first places they looked was their meal budget. By 1993, the nine major ai rlines had cu t food costs by 8 percent. Peanuts and crackers took the place of hot meals. Low-cost airlines that rarely served meals at all, like Southwest, steadily gained popularity. The pullback vanquished profitability in the catering business, which was already operat ing on razor-thin margins. \"They could not cut costs fast enough,\" Malek bitterly recalls of the airlines. Morris' Sel f-Destruction Caterair lost $185 million in fiscal 1993, down from a profit of $52 million the year before , and the comp any was in a dire positi on. At this point, dissension began to fester in the boardroom."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"18 THE IRON TRIANGLE Norris wasn't making any friends at Caterair, riding management and looking for alternatives and exit strategies for the company's quickly evaporating business. He began taking matters into his own hands, looking for buyers an d raising money from personal acquaintances. He even held me etings with potential acquirers, like Sodexho, a massive international facilities management company. Norris was push ing his own agenda, and his fellow board members didn't appreciate it. But th ey all had their own agendas as well. With so much disparate intent in the boardroom, it's no wonder the company failed. Then Norris went too far. Carlyle had been attempting to negotiate a management fee at Caterair, a customary payment in a leveraged buyout, but something th at Carlyle did not ask for until years after the deal had been done. The Cate rair board was about to approve the fee, which would at least bring some dividends from the deal back to Carlyle. To do so, the bo ard held a meeting to vote on it. When it came time to vote, the bo ard asked those members of the board who were also on staff at Carlyle to leave the room, due to their obvious conflict of interests. Norris, who had been attending the meeting from Paris via speakerphone, unleashed an inexplicable tirade of obscenities aimed at the board, according to people who were in the room. Ap parently indignant at having to hang up during the vote, a perfectly reasonable request, Norris refused. His fiery outburst incensed the other board members, and ended up costing Carlyle the mana gement fee. Reminded of the incident, one Carlyle staffer expl ained Norris' ac tions like this: \"That's just Steve. One minute he's a brilliant businessman, on the trail of a big deal. The next he's a maniac. Steve is incredibly erratic.\" Norris then instructed one of his staffers at Carlyle to work up some numbers on how a sale to So dexho might save the equity in Caterair. Norris had very little confidence in Altobello's ability to steer the company through these troubled waters. He felt that Altobello had already missed opportunities to exit the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Craterair business with their reputations and their bank accounts intact. Norris often criticized Altobello's ineptitude to colleagues and friends. So instead of bringing the paperwork to the company's CEO, he naively brought it to Malek, thinking he could confide in him. It didn't take long for Alto bello to find out what was going on behind his back, and he went ballistic, according to Norris. Altobello told Norris he had no right to attempt a sale of \"his\" company. Norris was asked to le ave the board, and it would signal the beginning of the end of his Carlyle career. But it would get even uglier. Shortly after Norris left, in 1994, George W. Bush would also jump ship. In a move that would dog him throughout his Texas gubernatorial campaign, Bush quit th e board in May, in the midst of Caterair's financial unraveling. Incumbent Governor Ann Richards attacked Bush's business record, questioning Bush's claims that he was a successful businessman. \"Mr. Bush continues to insist that he's a successful businessman, but when you take a hard look at his record, it's clear that he's not wh at he says he is,\" said Chuck McDonald, Governor Richards' spokesperson. With layoffs and losses mounting at Caterair, it wa s hard to argue. Bush responded feebly in the Dallas Morning News, saying simply that \"the airline food business is going from hot meal s to peanuts, and this company is in the process of adjusting.\" The roof was caving in fast now, th e result of squabbling in the boardroom and difficult economic circumstances. Forbes ran a scathing expose of the company in September 1994, entitled \"Coffee, tea, or bankruptcy?\" In it, the magazine ridiculed Altobello for drawing more than half a million dollars in annual salary as his company went belly up . Competitors were beating Caterair to international markets, which were the only markets growing at this point. Finally, Caterair was unable to diversify into a number of the ancillary markets its competitors were exploring, because of a noncompete clause with Marriott the managers signed when they led the buyout five years earlier. It was now all too clear why"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"20 THE IRON TRIANGLE Mr. Marriott couldn't wait to unload the catering business. It was a lemon. Adding injury to insult, Representative Harold Ford told newspapers that he nearly choked to death during a Northwest flight in 1992, catered by Caterair. The Democratic congressman from Tennessee claimed there were multiple unidentified objects in his steak and potatoes that tore up his mouth a nd throat. He filed a lawsuit for $18 million against Caterair. It was horribly embarrassing for the faltering company, and it would coinci de with Caterair's last gasp. In September 1995, Caterair completed a deal with Onex Food Services, the parent company of S ky Chefs, Inc. The value of the transaction was slightly more th an $500 million, far less than the $650 million that was originally paid for the company, which had grown its operations in the six years it had been independent, and should have been worth much, much more. It was, by all accounts, a disastrous deal. Carlyle, Malek, and Altobello had all taken a bath on it. By this time, Malek had been spurned by Carlyle upon his return from the unsuccessful Bush reelection campaign and had gone on to start up his own private equity concern—Thayer Capital. He offers this understated comment on Caterair's ruination: \"What went wrong is that you had the Ira qi invasion of Kuwait and the explosion of oil prices, which led to reduced travel and higher oil prices for airlines. There was lower passenger count because people were afraid to travel, and now higher costs because of the huge spike in fuel. We were in a survival mode as the airlines uniformly and drastically cut food service. We had to find a way to come out of that as best we could, and we were able to do that by merging it into Sky Chefs. We got enough cash to pay off debts, and a little bit of equity.

Until Norris left the company in 1995, Carlyle would struggle with achieving solidarity among its upper management and creating a unified identity.

Caterair turned out to be a very expensive intro duction to then- President Bush's son for Carlyle. From George W. Bush, to James Baker, to George H. W. Bush, the connections made through Caterair would bolster Carlyl e's ability to hook hi gh-profile politicians leaving office. In the end, they had Malek, the man to whom they coldly turned their ba cks, to thank for it. But it wasn't until 1989, after th e Reagan administration had cleared out its desks, that Ma lek's stamp was permanently im- pressed on Carlyle. Rubenste in asked Malek who he thought would be a good person to hire co ming out of the Reagan White House. Malek thought immediately of Frank Carlucci, the outgoing secretary of defense, and the man who had succeeded him as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in 1972. Malek held a cocktail party at his house in Washington, spoke to Carlucci, and quickly s ealed the deal.

But it was Carlucci that served as th e foundation of Carlyle's political reputation. He was the first high-profile, well-publicized hire by Carlyle (Malek was kept quiet for f ear of bad press). It was Carlucci that really got the ball rolling, despite his checkered past. Depending on your politi cal leanings, Carlucci 's early curriculum vitae read either like a resume for president of the United States or a checklist of foreign policy snafus. From his days with the U.S. State Department in the explosive C ongo to his clean up of the Iran- Contra affair, Carlucci has been everywhere, seen everything, and knows everyone. He has been calle d \"Mr. Clean\" for his ability to mop up politically damaging situations, and \"Carlucci the Cutter,\" for his relentless budget trimming. It was this type of ultimate Washington insider that Carlyle was fishing for wh en they hooked him in the winter of 1989. And that 's exactly what they got. Carlucci's tenure at the firm would result in an astonishing litany of high-powered hirings, fr om James Baker III to John Major to George H. W. Bush, himself. But it was Carlucci's dark political past, and the relationships fostered therei n, that suddenly made Carlyle's future so bright. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1930 to the son of an immigrant stonecutter from Southern Italy, the diminutive, soft-spoken Carlucci attended Princeton Univ ersity, where he roomed, wrestled, and recreated with close friend Donald Rumsfeld. He served two years in the U.S. Navy, took so me classes at Harvard Business School, and signed up with the St ate Department as a Foreign Service officer in 1956. After two years as vice consul and economic officer to Johannesburg, South Africa, Carlucci was assigned to the volatile Congo ( now known as Za ire) as second secretary in the U.S. Emba ssy. He was 30 years old. The year was 1960, and the Congo was a dangerous place to be. The former Belgian colony received its independence in late June and was holding its first public election. But the mood was still uncertain, and the population was volatile. By July, Patrice"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"24 THE IRON TRIANGLE Lumumba and his nationalist part y had assumed control of the sprawling country. Lumumba was ru mored to be tight with com- munist factions in the Soviet Union, and the election results put the United States on edge. Even after Congo's new leadership had been established by democratic means, sporadic violence throughout the country was not uncommon. While negotiating through tribal violence, which had been fo- mented by the Belgian colonial g overnment for years, Carlucci's daughter was threatened at bayonet-point, and Carlucci himself was stabbed between the shoulder blad es and arrested after a car he was riding in struck and killed a bicyclist. But Carlucci, who was once called \"a tough little monkey\" by his father, stayed on in the Congo, despite the life-threatening circumstances. Lumumba stayed in power only two months, replaced by Mobuto Sese Seko, America's handpicked successor, in the fall. But the threat of a Lumumba-led coup to recapture power rema ined. Uncomfortable with that prospect, the United States began planning an assassination attempt. A poisons expert was dispatched to the region to carry out the mission. An investigative committee led by Senator Frank Church would later reveal that President Eisenhower himself had ordered the assassination. Though many Americans suspected that their go vernment engaged in this kind of murderous behavior during th e Cold War, the Church report made it frighteningly real. And undeniably true. Lumumba was eventually assassina ted, though not by U.S. forces. Instead, rival factions within the Congo took his life during a scheduled prisoner transfer. Many still believe the United States was behind the assassination, sharing information on the time and place of the transfer with the executioners. The Church report ultimately cleared the CIA of i nvolvement. That didn't stop filmmaker Raoul Peck, a native of the Congo who has dedicated his professional life to researching and telling the story of Patrice Lumumba, from including a scen e in his docudrama Lumumba that shows a group of men plotting Lumumba's murder."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Mr. Clean 25 At one point during a vote on th e means of assassination, an actor playing Carlucci is asked wh at he thinks.

We'll respect your decisi on.\" Peck says his extensive research uncovered that Carlucci was involved in the plot at the highest level, and the scene was used to illustrate that point. Carlucci would fight the filmmaker, and eventually have the scene edited (his name is bleeped out), saying it was a simple case of mistaken identity. \"I was never as fat as that guy,\" he charmingly told reporters at the film's ope ning. \"The scene is tendentious, false, libelous; it never happened, and it is a cheap shot.\" Peck says today that the film's distributor did not want to run the risk of a lawsuit, but Peck stands by the veracity of the film, and in particular, that scene. Cold War Operative to Career Politician Thus, began Frank Carlucci's rise through the ranks of the executive branch. Before being offered the number two job at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in 1969 under his old friend Donald Rumsfeld, he was accused of leading the overthrow of Joao Goulart in Brazil in 1964, Abeid Karume of Zanzibar in 1972, and Salvador Allende of Chile in 1973, accord ing to the London Times.

During his time at the CIA, Carlucci wa s accused by conservative senators of weakening the agency through budget cuts, a charge that worked against him when those same senators voted against his nomination as deputy secretary of defense under Reagan (though he was ultimately approved for the job). He also pushed for legislation that limits the public's right to learn of CIA activity through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, an important tool for Americans wanting to know more about the actions of their elected officials. By February 1981, working under Caspar Weinberger in the defense department, Carlucci was cultivating a new re putation, that of a master bureaucrat, efficient manager, and loyal citizen.

Carlucci had accepted his position w ith Carlyle almost immediately after leaving office, but had only worked peripherally on defense deals. By September 1990, just 18 months after Frank Carlucci had resigned his post as defens e secretary, the man who had reengineered defense spending and procurement at the Pentagon was ready to bring his expertise to bear on the industry he had shaped. Though he had already been wheeling and dealing on behalf of Carlyle with regard to other defense properties, he was now legally able to accept an official position with a defense contractor, an important distinction that would attract defense companies to Carlyle. With Carlucci \"cooled off,\" Carlyle's defense prospects were really heating up. Defense spending was still anemic after the end of the Cold War and before the beginning of the Gulf War, and Ford Motor Company was looking to divest its defense holdings, namely Ford Aerospace. Carlyle fought hard to buy the entire unit, but it lacked the capital, a shortcoming that would often plague the company in the early going. In the end, the fledgling company lost Ford Aerospace to Loral, a much more established player in"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Carlucci's Connections defense. Loral bought Ford Aerospace for $715 million in cash. But thanks to Frank, Carlyle wasn't entirely cut out of the deal. Carlucci's contacts would prove valuable early and often in his career at Carlyle. In particular, his close friendship with Earle Williams, president and chief executive of BDM International, a defense consulting subsidiary of Ford Aerospace, would deliver Carlyle with the firm's most lucrative defense buy out of the early 1990s. BDM is one of the most successful defense consulting businesses in the history of the industry. When it was founded in 1959 in El Paso, Texas, the company was focused on doing weapons systems analysis, a geeky trade they plied mostly at offices in New Mexico. In 1962, they hired Earle Williams, a young engineer from Alabama, who over the next three decades, that included his promotion to CEO in 1972, came to embody the new spirit of the company, a hard- driving consultancy intent on expa nding its business to all parts of the armed forces. In 1973, W illiams and BDM put the harsh summers of Texas behind and moved to McLean, Virginia, just outside of Washington, DC, in order to be closer to the federal government with which it was now doing most of its business. He was moving them to where the money was. It didn't take long for the compan y to learn the harsh lessons of doing business in Washington, when competitors stole contract after contract from under th em because of tight pol itical connec-tions and well-timed campaign donations. It was a lesson that Williams learned the hard way, but one he would never forget. Over the next two decades, the outs poken Williams would thoroughly insinuate himself into the DC power scene. Suddenly, Williams was everywhere on Capito l Hill, holding fund-raisers, heading civic activities, rubbing elbows with key politicians, and landing on highly coveted advisory boards. Among the close ties that Williams forged during this time was a friendship with Mar-cia Carlucci, the wife of Frank Carlucci. Will iams' ability to work"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"34 THE IRON TRIANGLE the room was a style of doing bu siness that Carlyle would learn much from. And, as it turned out, it was highly lucrative. \"I didn't think there was anything unusual with what I was doing at . the time,\" says Williams, who retains his Alabama drawl and speaks with the ease of a man wh o has long since fought his most meaningful battles. \"I just figur ed if you want to know people, you go where they are. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.\" Williams got to know Frank thro ugh Marcia Carlucci, and also through his work with the Defe nse Department (DOD) when Carlucci was secretary of defens e. \"When [Carlucci] was in the DOD, we had a V.P. that was wo rking in the DOD that was on leave from us ... sort of,\" says Williams. Williams' relentless gripping-and-gri nning eventually paid off. In 1984, Williams was appointed to the Naval Research Advisory Board, which consulted the Navy on long-term strategic planning. BDM's competitors couldn't believe it. How did this man manage to convince the secretary of the Navy to place him on an advisory board that allowed access to confidential information and Navy officials? Particularly when the bu lk of BDM's business was with the Army and Air Force, not the Navy? (In 1983, BDM did just $1.9 million worth of business with the Navy, an insignificant fraction of their overall business and an unregistered blip on the Navy's massive procurement budget.) The answers would soon be forthcoming and would demonstrate just how much Williams had learned about doing busin ess in the Beltway. In the spring of 1983, BDM hire d a little-known market researcher by the name of Vicki Paisley for a ye arly salary of $40,000. It turned out to be an excellent hire. Pais ley's husband, Melvyn Paisley, was in charge of awarding Navy contracts. A year after the hiring of Vicki Paisley, Williams landed the cove ted position on the Navy's advisory board. \"Mel was instrumental in getting me on that board,\" recalls Williams, who says that Paisley approached him for the position, and Williams in itially demurred. \"I think"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Carlucci's Connections 35 you've got the wrong man, we work mostly with the Air Force and the Army,\" Williams told Paisley. But Paisley wouldn't relent, and eventually succeeded in signing up Williams. It was a coup for Williams, and it paid off almost immediately. Between his ap- pointment to the Naval Research Advisory Boar d in 1984 and the end of fiscal 1987, BDM had more than doubled its contracts with the Navy from $3.1 million to $6.6 million. Then, in the beginning of fiscal 1988, BDM was reporting to shareholders an expected $62 million in Navy contracts, accordin g to a Washington Post article. The build up in Navy contracts had other defense contractors from around the world scratching their heads. Competitors accused Williams of hiring Vicki Paisley as a favor to Melvyn, who then brought in Williams to the advi sory board, and subsequently awarded Navy contracts to BDM. Th e situation reeked of perceived impropriety, and the newspapers covered the entire story in great detail, but inexplicably no investigation was ca lled for at the time. Much of the new business BDM was garnering was in an area the Navy called Black Projects, or budgets that are kept secret because to publicize them would compromise national security. Lawmakers often complain about Black Projec ts, citing that many contracts are thusly classified, not because of national security concerns, but rather to avoid the required congressional review. Regardless, BDM was suddenly ratcheting up it s Navy business year after year. When Melvyn Paisley left the Pe ntagon in 1987, he took a job alongside his wife, consulting for BD M. It was a good time to get in. The company was clearly growing fa st, and in the midst of its good fortune, was bought in May 1988 by Ford Aerospace for an eye- popping $425 million. Times were good, and Earle Williams had finally showed the cutthroat defense contractors how business was done in the Beltway. Then in the summer of 1988, Operation I ll Wind swept through the Pentagon, exposing a ring of corruption, br ibery, and fraud that would eventually send dozens of officials to jail"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE IRON TRIANGLE for rigging the awarding of defens e contracts. For years, various elements in the government had su spected widespread corruption in the Pentagon and the defense busi ness. Several years of covert investigation proved those suspicions true. It was a crushing blow to the credibility of the Pentagon and the secretary of defense at the time, Frank Carlucci. Arrests, arra ignments, and convictions rained down weekly on the Pentagon, ar med forces officials, and the defense contractors with whom they all did business. The most prominent official convicted in the seven-year inves- tigation was none other than Melvyn Paisley, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the gove rnment, bribery, and theft of government property. He was sentenced to four years in prison for taking kickbacks. The FBI inve stigated BDM and the connection between Williams, Paisley, and his wife. Documents from the Paisley home were confiscated, incl uding at least a dozen relating to BDM. Williams was told th at he would eventually need to testify in front of the grand jury, but the bu reau was unable to bring a case against BDM, and, as Williams says, \"111 Wind just blew away.\" Williams had this to say about hi s role in the investigation: \"In hindsight, I understand why people would have thought we partic- ipated [in illegal acti vity]. When Vicki Paisley came to see me, I didn't know who she wa s, but she wanted the job. I was aware of a potential conflict, and I to ld her that it probably wouldn't be suitable. But she said she really wanted to work for me. I asked her why she was leaving her job at Computer Scienc es Corp. (CSC). She said it was because Mel told her to because CSC was doing too much Navy business, and it looked bad. I guess that's ironic. When 111 Wind hit, we started to lose business, but I told our clients we hadn't done anything wrong. There was never any real involvement of BDM in 111 Wind, and I guess the FBI just eventually figured we were small potatoes.\" But the damage had been done. Be tween the residue left from the scandal and the end of the Cold War, the value of BDM, now"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Carlucci's Connections a subsidiary of Ford Aerospace, plummeted. When Loral picked up Ford Aerospace in th e fall of 1990, Williams was intent on not working for Bernie Schwartz, then the head of Loral, for personal reasons. Ironically, Williams co nvinced Schwartz that owning BDM would be a conflict of interest fo r Loral, since BDM had consulted the Pentagon on systems that Loral produced. The perceived conflict of interest inherent in hiring Vicki Paisley seven years prior hadn't weighed on Williams ' conscience quite as much, apparently. After Williams got in touch with his good friend Frank Car-lucci, Conway negotiated the purchase, and $130 million later, BDM was the newest company in Carlyle's portfolio. That was less than a third of the $425 millio n Ford Aerospace had paid for the company just two years prior. Carlucci landed a job as chairman, Conway snagged a seat on the board, and W illiams stayed on as president and CEO. It was a steal. A New Friend After a couple of years, Williams, age 62, aspired towa rd a career in government service and, in earl y 1992, announced his retirement from the $400,000-a-year CEO job at BDM. It was time for another friend of Frank. This time, Carl ucci turned to an ol d buddy and tennis partner by the name of Phil Odeen, currently chairman of TRW. A vice chairman at Coopers Lybrand at the time, Odeen had known Carlucci for decades, having spent 13 years in the office of the secretary of defense early in his own career. Carlucci's wife had even worked with Odeen at Coopers. Odeen was also good friends with Williams, and so the circle was complete. Over a tennis match in the winter of 1992, Ca rlucci popped the question. \"He asked me if I had any interest in the job, and I had just been promoted to vice chairman at Coopers and moved to New"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"38 THE IRON TRIANGLE York,\" Odeen told me. \"I said no thanks, but if you don't find the right person, give me a call.\" Carlucci called the very next morning and arranged a Sunday morning breakfast meeting in DC between Conway, Rubenstei n, and Carlucci. Apparently, Carlucci had indeed found the right person, and it was Odeen. Within a week, Odeen had an of fer, and by May, Odeen was the new president and CEO of BDM. \"I t all happened very fast,\" re- calls Odeen. Under Odeen's watch, BDM would transform itself from a business heavily reliant on defense contracti ng to a more diversified services company. \"The Cold War was ov er, and defense budgets were coming down,\" explains Odeen. \"Information and communications technology were more important than ships and tanks.\" Odeen did a bang-up job getting BD M into emerging enterprise resource planning (ERP) and warehouse automation markets. But it was st ill defense that buttere d BDM's bread. And controversy in that arena was set to strike yet again. On Christmas Eve, 1994, the New Yo rk Times reported that Frank Carlucci had again been involved in a clandestine arms deal, this time with the Soviets. With Carlucci as chairman, BDM, now a Carlyle portfolio company, had brokered a deal between the Pentagon and the former Soviet Re public of Belarus to secretly purchase an S-300, the Soviet's version of the Patriot missile defense system the United States had used so effectively during the Gulf War. After the Cold War, the Russians were selling weapons to both allies and enemies of the United States . They needed the cash and no longer had much use for weapons, so the Russians opened up an arms bazaar. In another black bu dget project, BDM was hired in 1992 to acquire the S-300 for the De fense Intelligence Agency's Missile and Space Intelligence Center in Alabama. American forces wanted the weap ons so they could take them apart, see how they work, and develop ways to defeat them."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Carlucci's Connections For the deal, BDM used the infamous Canadian arms dealer Emmanuel Weigensberg, the same man that brokered the Iran- Contra arms shipments for the Re agan White House. The reason for the secrecy around the de al, says Odeen, was that the Russians were selling the same weapons to Amer ica's enemies and wouldn't want those customers to know the Russians were playing both sides of the fence. But others speculated that the Russians had been duped. That they never knew they were selling the S-300 to the Americans, and had they known, would never have gone through with the transaction. Hence, the need for a middleman like Weigensberg, to obfuscate the actual buyers. Odeen denies those accusations. \"We did not do these deals openly or publicly, but they [the Russians] knew who they were selling to,\" says Odeen. \"This was a decent business for us. We had the relationships, and we were essentially a broker.\" But BDM's competitors didn't see it that way. Again, there were charges of favoritism, cronyism, and quid pro quo. Russian military officials were reportedly incensed by the transaction, claiming they had no knowledge of the ultimate buyer. Competitors griped about their inability to penetrate the relationship between BDM and the Pentagon. They said that BDM's connections, particularly within Carlyle, were to blame. At the time, Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon told the Times that he was \"concerned about any allegations of unfairness and will review them as appropriate.\" But BDM was cleared again. The company seemed to have acquired Carlucci's Houdini-esque ability to sidestep scandal. As it turned out, BDM had in place something called a \"basic ordering agreement,\" or an ongoing, open-ended, long-term contract with the Pentagon. The agreement did put BDM on an inside track with regards to foreign weapons procurement. \"Otherwise, it can get very bureaucratic,\" says Odeen. As for Carlucci's potential involvemen t, having advocated long-term"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE IRON TRIANGLE contracts that protect vendors like BDM when he wa s secretary of defense, Odeen recites an exculp atory mantra heard over and over again throughout Carlyle's history. \"I don't think Frank had anything to do with that at all,\" says Odeen. He adds, \"But being connected to Carlyle sure doesn't hurt.\" Indeed, BDM's connections to Carl yle have done nothing but help them. And the deal didn't work out too badly for Carlyle, either. First, Carlyle took the company public in 1994. Then in 1997, TRW paid $975 million for BDM, making Carlyle's $130 m illion investment just seven years earlier, look brilliant. Phil Odeen went on to become the chairman at TRW, which then became one of the largest defense contractors in the country. In the words of Fred Malek, this deal was a \"screaming home run.\" Carlyle also used BDM in doing due diligence on future defense deals. It was a perfect setup. Because BDM had so much consulting experience and had worked with most of the major contractors, Carlyle had built in proprietary knowledge of dozens of defense companies. And this is where th e bulk of Carlyle's early deals would come from. Some were more successful than others, but with defense, Carlyle had found a ca lling. They had found a business that they understood, in which they had myriad connections, and could make loads of cash. They had found what would become their identity. But with the acquisition of BDM, Carlyle was agreeing to do business in the shadowy world of defense contracting; a murky business with which Carlucci was well acquainted, but Norris and Rubenstein knew little about. The d ecision to go down this road would eventually make Carlyl e one of the largest defense contractors in the country and wo uld create the controversial be- hemoth it is today."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"5 GETTING DEFENSIVE It's tike shooting fish in a barrel. —Former Chrysler chairman Lee lacocca, Washington Post, March 31, 1985 Cast of Characters M.

After the BDM deal was completed, the rest of the defense world knew Carlucci meant business."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE IRON TRIANGLE In the years following the BDM acq uisition, Carlyle would embark on a stunning series of defense dealings, fighting it out with the giants of defense contracting, and quite often having their hats handed to them. But many of the deals they did win were hugely successful, as well as controversia l, and built them into the nation's eleventh largest defense contractor. The disconcerting pattern of doing business with questionable companies continued, however, and signaled Carlyle's willingness to dwell in the dark underworld of the defense industry. With BDM's consulting help, Carlyle made a run at the top defense play ers in the nation and, when it was all said and done, carved them selves a place at the top. An Arsenal of Democracy The government has a long histor y of overpaying for weapons, of- fering interest-free loans, waiving federal taxes, bailing out floundering defense contractors, and even paying generous ter- mination fees to unsuccessful ve ndors. The Defense Department has bailed out more than 6,000 defense companies since 1958, under an act of Congress known as the Extraordinary Contractual Relief Act. It is all done in the interests of \"national security.\" And it amounts to a government-subsidize d industry, doing business over a safety net. Carlucci had as much to do with the current state of defense spending as anybody. As deputy defense secretary under Wein- berger, Carlucci developed a Pentagon policy of procurement that called for higher profits for the defe nse industry. It also lowered the risks within defense contracti ng, ensuring long-term and no-bid contracts, both moves intended to encourage private companies to enter the market. Privatization, th e practice of taking government- run offices and departments an d forming for-profit, private companies, was all the rage. The idea was to build"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Getting Defensive 43 up a healthy and happy private defens e industry that would carry the United States to victory in the Cold War. And juice the economy while we were at it. It worked. The defense industry blossomed under Reagan's watch by creating, and the former pres ident himself termed it, an \"arsenal of Democracy. \" At one point in 19 85, a Washington Post expose on the defense industry uncovered that the Pentagon was spending an average of $28 million an hour—24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The top 13 contractors had revenues of more than $122 billion. Those same contractors were also the ones consulting the government on which weapons to buy and when. And few of the defense contractors were payi ng taxes. The numbers were astounding. It was a great time to be in the de fense business. But it wouldn't last. Just nine months after Carlucci to ok his post at Carlyle, the defense business came to a screeching halt, marked by the felling of the Berlin Wall on November 10, 1989, and the subsequent end of the Cold War. The defense industry went into instant retreat. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney announced a \"peacetime dividend\" and quickly slashed $180 billion off the defense budget. Because of the end of the Cold War, everyone knew that the budget cuts were imminent, but no one thought it would be so quick, and so severe. Values of defense companies plummeted. Contractors didn't know what had hit them. It was a perfect time to get into defense buyouts, when all the properties were cheap, and Carl ucci knew it. After the BDM buyout, Carlyle bega n bearing down on the defense market in earnest. The first object of its affection was a Pennsylvania-based industrial co mpany that owned an undervalued defense division that ma de howitzers and othe r military equipment, Harsco Corp. The defense division that Harsco harbored would later become the now well-known Unite d Defense (much more on that later). The only problem was, Harsco wasn't interested in selling. Harsco employees didn't want to sell the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"44 THE IRON TRIANGLE company at such a low point, locking in their losses. As a result, they resisted Carlyle's overtures, which often happens in the fierce world of leveraged buyouts, as companies struggle to maintain their independence during hard time s, while the vultures circle above. Carlyle went to plan B. If th ey couldn't convince Harsco man- agement to sell the co mpany outright, they would start snatching up public shares. It was more time -consuming and generally more expensive to acquire a company this way, but the thinking is that by gaining a large position in stock, they could begin to exert some pressure on Harsco's management. So Carlyle began accumulating a large stock position in Ha rsco, about 6 percent of the total shares outstanding. If they didn't want to sell, Carlyle was going to put the screws to them, threat ening to acquire a majority share in the company. Then, at 2:30 P . M . on Ground Hog Day 1990, Harsco CEO M. W. Gambill got the ca ll from Frank Carlucci. It is known as a courtesy call, making a CEO aware of an aggressor's increasing position in a public co mpany, as if Gambill hadn't already noticed. Carlucci and the boys at Carlyle had their eye on Harsco's defense division, whose va lue had been decimated by the retreat in defense spending. But Harsco still wasn 't interested. Carlyle quickly increased its position in the company, until it became the majority shareholder with nearly 7 percent of the company. It submitted a restructuring plan to the company that included a tempting $15-a-share dividend, an appeal to shareholders of the company, a move designed to outflank Harsco's management. Harsco s till wouldn't budge, and the com- pany rejected the proposal outright. It was a slap in the face to Carlyle, and symbolic of the compa ny's early lack of clout. Carlucci 's reputation alone was not enough to get potential buyout targets excited. The company ha d no track record, and Harsco could not be sure of its intentions. Would Carlyle just break the company up and sell it for parts? Or would they nu rture it back to health, then sell it for a profit? There wa s no precedent by which"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Getting Defensive 45 Harsco could judge Carlyle. And they would just as soon not do business with them. Carlyle was not through, however. The company upped its stock position to 10 percent, and demande d two positions on Harsco's board, as negotiations became mo re contentious. Harsco, under significant pressure now, compromi sed, offering Carlyle one position on its board. But Harsco never sold the unit to Carlyle outright. Harsco had maintained its inde pendence and fended off a hostile takeover. It cost Carlyle $63 million in stock to gain that one board seat, not to mention the time and labor costs of doing due diligence on Harsco. On the surface, it was a terrible deal. But six years later, when Carlyle used that board seat to steal United Defense away from General Dyna mics, it would prove to be one of the best deals the company ever made. More Ill Wind Shortly after this failure, Carlyle turned its attention to another highly controversial acquisition target: Unisys Corp. Now known mostly for its mainframe computer and IT services business, Unisys was among many companies looking to divest itself of a money-losing defense division. But in June 1988, in the middle of Carlucci's tenure as defense secretary, Operation 111 Wind, the same investigation th at had attempted to nail BDM, took down Unisys. The probe, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica, resulted in convictions against 45 individuals and $225 million in fines. It was a comp rehensive web of co rporate and political corruption in the military, exactly what Eisenhower had warned against 30 years earlier. And it wa s all uncovered during Carlucci's watch. In September 1991, after the probe was complete, Unisys alone paid $190 million in fines for bribing public officials en route to hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts. The company pleaded"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"46 THE IRON TRIANGLE guilty to conspiracy, bribery, and illegally overtoiling the govern- ment. Unisys had been disgraced and, as a result, was thoroughly devalued. Of all the companies im plicated in Operation 111 Wind, Unisys probably took th e worst hit. And now, Ca rlyle was looking to pick the defense division up on the cheap. Ultimately though, much like with Ha rsco, Carlyle would fail. Unisys and Carlyle would flirt for the better part of a year before Unisys chose to take the division public instead. Carlyle was having trouble convincing potential buyout partners to get in bed with them, an obstacle that is not uncommon for young buyout firms. Each failed takeover attempt costs money, though. And the payoffs were not forthcoming. It was another deva stating setback fo r the incipient company, but it would not prove fatal. Not even close. The folks at Carlyle were learning on the job. They had taken a few lumps, but in the co mpany's 1992 bidding wa r for the defense and aerospace division of LTV Corp., they would show off their newly acquired erudition. The saga of LTV would ultimately consume a full year, involve multiple cour t battles, and even require a presidential intervention before it was done. Rubenstein would call it the most difficult transaction he ha d ever been involved in. It was, in a word, wild. The fun once again started with a call from Frank Carlucci, this time to his friend Norman Augustine, chairman of defense giant Martin Marietta and former a ssistant secretary of the Army. Together with Lockheed Corp., Ma rtin Marietta had announced on February 3, 1992, the purchase of LTV's defense and aerosp ace division, which was in bankruptcy at the time, for $355 million. It was a steal and, for all intents and purposes, a done deal. But on March 27 of that year, Augustine took a call from Carlucci, who asked if Lockheed and Martin Ma rietta might be willing to cut Carlyle into the deal. Augustine was shocked and confused. For the past few months, Carlyle had been putting together a competitive bid for the division, with its partner Thomson-CSF, the French defense contractor."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Getting Defensive 47 Why would Carlucci be asking in on his deal? Especially now, when it was pr actically done? As it turned out, things weren't going so well between Carlyle and Thomson. Carlyle once again couldn't get the financing in order for its share of the deal, and Thomson wouldn't proceed without it. The fragile partnership the two had constructed was falling apart. Thomson chairman Alain Gomez was calling aro und, looking for other partners that had the capital, and could complete the deal. All of which led Carlucci to call his old friend Augustine. Bill's Will Conway and Rubenstein met with Augustine and offered $50 million to get in, money they said would be useful if Thomson were to succeed in finding a nother partner and make a new more competitive bid at the eleventh hour. Augustine turned them down flatly, apparently unconvin ced that Thomson would ever reemerge as a real th reat. It looked like it was over. Thomson of- ficials had abandoned hope, and Augustine felt certain that LTV was his. But Bill Conway had other ideas. A relentless businessman, Conway was largely responsible for building MCI Communications into a major player in the tele- communications industry as chie f financial officer during the 1980s. He had an impeccable reputa tion in financial circles, often cited as one of the top handful of CFOs in the country. He was a fearsome manager in th e Carlyle offices, building tight-knit groups of his favorite empl oyees and largely igno ring the rest of the company. One former employee said, \"You're either in with Bill or your out, and if you're out, he 'll make your life miserable.\" Conway is a conservative businessm an from New England and a real company man. Many ex-employees credit him with cultivating an atmosphere of intimidation in the Carlyle offices, putting"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"48 THE IRON TRIANGLE employees in place by firing off companywide e-mails stating, \"I'm sick and tired of people complain ing about their offices and their office furniture. It's not your offi ce or your furniture. It's mine.\" He was notoriously cheap and would often gripe loudly about there being too many employees at Carl yle, \"sitting around my offices, drinking strawberry flavored water.\" The way Carlyle was structured, th e partners got very, very rich from big deals, and no one else saw a dime outside of their salary. Conway would inexplicably remind employees of this sore spot when he would close out a company meeti ng by proclaiming it was time to go out \"and make me money.\" According to those who worked for him, he could be alternately brilli ant, driven, and despotic. And he never gave up on a deal. Two days before the bankruptcy ju dge was to award LTV's assets to Martin Marietta and Lockheed, Conway got the needed money together from Carlyle's old benefa ctor, the Mellon family, and called Thomson to make nice. With the money in hand, Thomson and Carlyle quickly resolved their diff erences, waltzed into bankruptcy court, and offered $400 million in cash fo r LTV aerospace, $45 million more than the Martin Mari etta/Lockheed team had offered. Conway had pulled it off, against all odds. Augusti ne was floored, and defeated. Or so it seemed. This war was just heating up. Augustine kicked it into overdrive, setting up meetings with Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense Don Atwood, and Assistant Secretary of the Army Stephen Conver. Augustine argued that selling LTV's defense and aerospace division to Thomson, a company partly owned by the Fr ench government, would be a breach of national security. Martin Marietta sent a raft of lobbyist to the Hill to persuade lawmaker s to come out against the deal. And quickly the tide turned. Augustine was making progress in blocking the sale. Carlucci work ed the phones, as well, getting assurances from several Pentagon officials that the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Getting Defensive 49 deal would go through, despite th e concerns of lawmakers over foreign ownership. In the final day of bankruptcy court, the bidding escalated rapidly. Augustine had created enough uncerta inty over whether the U.S. regulatory agencies would approv e the deal, that the game was once again wide open. Because LTV's creditors were concerned over regulatory approval of the deal, which wouldn't be known until months after the actual sale, Carlyle and Thomson were forced to increase their bid to $430 million, pl us a $17 million nonrefundable deposit. In the event that the sale was denied by lawmakers under national security concerns, Carlyle would pay LTV $17 million for nothing. Martin Marietta and Lockheed upped their bid to $385 million and urged creditors to consider the likelihood that the Carlyle-Th omson deal would never get approved. Carlyle would ev entually offer another $20 million, plus a $20 million nonrefundable deposit. That was enough, and the judge awarded LTV's missile divisi on to Thomson and the aircraft division to Carlyle. The boys fr om Carlyle had finally done it. They had gone up against the best, and won.

Thomson would eventually pull out of the running altogether, flinging the door open to renewed bidding, and getting Augustine back into the game. The race was on again.

The nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, the Prince was a glamorous, wealthy jet setter who ha d spent much of his formative years studying in the United States . After earning his bachelor's degree in business administration at tiny Menlo College in Cali- fornia in 1979, he went to Syracuse University in upstate New York to get his masters in social science. Upon re turning to Saudi Arabia, the Prince immediately began building his investment portfolio, mostly in real estate and construction . At first, he wasn't so good at it, and he burned through a $30,000 gift from his father within months. At that time, he approached Citigroup in Riyadh, an American bank, to ask for a loan. They rejected him flatly. But he went on to accumulate millions, at least some of which came through acting as a liaison between foreign construction contractors and local businesses, though the source of much of the Prince's fortunes remains unknown. Through his gains, he formed the Kingdom Holding Company, an investment vehicle through which he could play with his mill ions. But the Prin ce was looking for more, much more. He was looki ng toward investing in America. The timing was right. America an d Saudi Arabia were cooperating on defeating Saddam Hussein's aggr ession in Kuwait. It was one of the first times the United States and Saudi Arabia had their political agendas in line. Saudi Ar abia had committed more than a hundred thousand troops to the c onflict in the gulf, and those soldiers were fighting beside Am erican troops. Many saw this as the dawn of a new era of cooper ation between the two nations, both politically and financially. And they were right. Back at home in the United States, the mighty banks were gasping for air. Stocks were plummeting all around the financial sector, and bankruptcies were not uncommon. The fallout from the savings and loan crisis was littered along Wall Street. It was on this shaky ground that Citicorp, America's largest bank at the time, f ound itself in February 1991.

It was in desperate need of financing, a lot of financing. Citicorp was looking for as much as $1.5 billion to stay afloat, and they were hoping to raise it through the sale of stock. They were looking for a white knight. A Saudi Savior Enter the Prince. Prince Alwaleed was watching the events in the United States closely, as he always did, and he had decided it was time to put his money to work in America. Known for his eccen- tricities, the Prince would often dr ag a caravan of trucks out into the desert to relax. There, with the baking, barren desert glowing all around him, he would sit in a te nt complex, entertain guests, and watch multiple satellite televisi on hook ups, staying abreast of world news. A seasoned critic of American media, he had been following the saga of Citicorp from the beginning. He decided it was time to invest. Working through his representative in the United States, San Francisco lawyer Faissel Fahad, th e Prince was put in touch with a prominent DC-based law firm. B ecause of the tricky political nature of a deal involving a major U.S. bank and a foreign investor, the firm felt they needed an advi sor that offered more than just traditional investment banking ad vice. They decided they needed the Carlyle Group, to help them navigate the choppy waters of federal approval for the deal. After all, Carlyle had the government connections, they were based in DC, and a sensitive deal like this was going to need a delicate po litical touch. They called Norris. The Prince had loads of cash, and Citicorp needed it. But at the time, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady had been pushing reform in the banking industry, to allow banks more fl exibility in the types of business they could enter. It was intended to diversify"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"54 THE IRON TRIANGLE banks from the disastrous sa vings and loan business, and strengthen the industry by giving it more options. But there was concern that opponents to the legislation would use the fear of foreign ownership in American ba nks as a sticking point to hold up the reform. A deal between a weal thy Saudi Prince and the nation's largest bank was all reform opponents needed to prove their case. It was, to say the least, a ve ry sensitive time in the banking industry. Norris and the Prince kne w this, and the two worked hard to structure a deal with Citi corp that would allay any and all concerns, but still get the much-needed capital into the hands of Citicorp. Norris and the Prince spoke often, sometimes two or three times a day, for hours on end. One conversation was temporarily interrupted while the Prince watched the American Patriot De- fense system shoot down an Iraq i Scud missile outside his window. Unphased by the attack, the Prince and Norris picked up the conversation where they had left off. \"It was a crazy time,\" re- members Norris. \"The Prince and I were extremely close. I have a passport full of Saudi stamps. I don't even know how many times I went over there.\" The negotiations were cordial but intense. During the deal-making process, Norris asked Citicorp for a board seat in return for the Prince's investment. It was a pure red herring. A shrewd negotiating tactic, designed to be dropped in a show of concession, which it later was. Neither the Prince nor Norris thought they would get it. In fact, they knew it would make the Federal Reserve Board's approval of the deal nearly impossible. But it worked to perfection. After months of prep aration, they got the deal preapproved by the Federal Reserve Board (Fed), by conceding measures they never intended to s ecure and assuring me mbers that the Prince would be a passive investor. Th e thinking at the Fed was that everyone wanted the Prince to inve st his money to save Citicorp, they just didn't want him to exercise any control over his"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"An Arabian White Knight 55 investment. It was a lo t to ask, but Norris and the Prince had ex- pected it. The Fed also spent months researching where the Prince's money was comi ng from. Rumors that Prince was acting as a front for other investors ran rampant. There was concern about Middle Eastern investors using the Prince to launder their money. But finally, the Fed relented, and the deal went through. On February 21, 1991, a mammoth de al was announced. The Prince would be purchasing $590 million worth of stock in Citicorp, and bailing out the bank that once turn ed him away when he needed a loan back in his home country. Th e shares were nonvot-ing preferred stock, which meant that the Prince could not vote his shares in proxy battles. But, he would be a llowed to convert the shares to common stock at an exercise pric e of $16 a share in just eight months. He already owned 4.9 perc ent of the common stock, which he had acquired over ti me in the fall of 1990. Th at meant that if he were to convert his shares in October 1991, he would hold almost 15 percent of the common shares. In other words, he would be one of the company's largest shareholders. Media Misteps The stock jumped up 8 percent in the week following the an- nouncement, and the press was all over the news. Who was Prince Alwaleed? How did he get so much money? Who is the Carlyle Group? Would the Prince be seeking a board seat in return for his investment? Is this a new beginning for financial co- operation between Saudi Arabia and the United States? There with the answers to all of these pressing questions, in all his glory, was Stephen L. Norris, the co-founder of the Carlyle Group and the man who had engineered th e biggest deal of the year. He was quoted everywhere, and figured prominently in a BusinessWeek profile of the deal. Norris told the press that the Prince would not be asking for a board seat. But that he didn't"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"56 THE IRON TRIANGLE plan to be completely passive ei ther. After all, who invests $590 million of his own money and doesn't expect his voice to be heard on important decisions? No, Prince Alwaleed would be an \"active\" investor, said Norris. Norris' statements proved to be we ll off the mark, an d they set off the alarm bells at the Federal Reserve Board, the same board that had already been promised Alwaleed would remain a passive investor. Originally, th e Fed had been assured that Alwaleed would not attempt to \"influence management\" for at least five years, though he would be al lowed to speak his views to the board of directors, says Norris today. That was the deal. But Norris' statements to the press after the d eal appeared to contradict that agreement, and the Fed wanted some answers. The Prince's people feverishly wo rked the phones that next day, desperately trying to convince the Fed that Norris was out of line, not expressing himself clearly, a nd that the Prince had every intention to remain passive. In th e middle of all of this, a 1988 article in Forbes surfaced, in whic h Alwaleed is quoted as saying the role of the passive investor is not for him. \"I want my voice to be heard ... I would love to be a corporate raider,\" he said. Suddenly, the whole reason that the Prince had chosen Car-lyle in the first place—to help him traverse th e rocky regulatory terrain—had blown up in his face. In addition, the Prince took grave offense at what he perceived as Norris taking credit for the deal in the press. The Prince, not unreasonably, wanted to be seen as the savior of Citicorp. Instead, Carlyle was getting all the credit. No rris' Carlyle partners also felt he was becoming too personally invol ved in the success of a client, too public. The fiasco that resulted began the long, drawn-out process of Norris' exco mmunication from the firm. Ultimately, and after much cajoling, the Fed allowed the deal to go through. But they forced the Prince to sell the 4.9 percent of common shares he had previously accumulated, and mandated that he not own more than 9.9 percent of the overall stock."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"An Arabian White Knight 57 The move cost the Prince millions in future profits. It was a public sign from the Fed that they were going to remain ex- tremely vigilant. With his newly acquired shares of Citicorp, Al- waleed had also bought himself a very high profile in the United States. His moves would be scrutinized by regulators and investors alike. The rumors that Alwaleed was investing money on behalf of Middle Eastern i nvestors that don't want their identities revealed continued to dog him. The accusations were adamantly denied by Al waleed—and are still denied to this day. (Those who know him say the Prince sees himself as a link between the Arab world and America—a Saudi with a soft spot for true capitalism.) A Source Emerges Then, in the Spring of 1991 shortly after the Ci ticorp investment, the Bank of Credit and Commerce Inte rnational (BCCI) scandal ripped through the banking world like a miss ile. The fifth largest private bank in the world, as it turned out, was nothing but a fraud-ridden front, laundering money for drug lords and terrorists throughout the Middle East. BCCI was also trying to gain control of American banks. It was a scandal of epic proportions that brought down dozens of high-profile members of the international banking community. It was the largest bank fraud case ever. And it didn't bode well for the Citicorp deal. After BCCI, the media speculated that Alwaleed might be up to the same thing. In an in terview with CNBC 10 ye ars later, Alwaleed described the situation like this, \"We had Arabs involved with BCCI at that time. And they had a big scandal there, unfortunately. They (the Fed) looked at what I had th ere, we had a big discussion, long discussions, they could not find an ything wrong with it at all. But I got the message that they were in a difficult position.\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"58 THE IRON TRIANGLE The Fed was indeed in a difficu lt position in trying to save Citicorp—the nation's largest ba nk. According to one person involved in the Citicorp negotiations, the Fed suspected that the money Alwaleed was investing was not his own, and officials there \"looked the other way.\" The source says that the lack of due diligence in adhering to the rule s that require transparency of foreign investors facilitated the Fed's goal of saving Citicorp. A source close to Alwaleed now says that at least some of the money belonged to Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia's defense minister. The defense minister could not be reached for comment, and the Prince maintains that all of the money he invested was his. Since the Citico rp flap, Alwaleed has regularly, and voluntarily, disclosed selected investments to the public, even though he is under no obligation to do so. But he only discloses what he wants to. Despite its controversial nature, th e Citicorp deal put both Carlyle and Alwaleed on the map. Ma ny believed the deal was the financial embodiment of the political accord between the United States and Saudi Arabia. In a Washington Post article at the time of the deal, Shafiqul Islam, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said \"h ere the profit motive and the political motive seem to coincide. Right now, the Saudis are our good friends, and Citicorp does n eed the money.\" Politically, it could be considered as a quid pro quo for the United States \"helping them\" in the Gulf War. It was a rare time when the United States and Saudi Arabia were both politically and finan- cially aligned, and it opened a brief window of opportunity for Carlyle and the Prince. But it w ouldn't always be that way. Surprisingly, consider ing the magnitude of the deal, Norris and Carlyle walked away with a me re $50,000 of the Prince's money (they were paid more handsomel y by Citicorp, though they won't disclose how much).

But more importantly, the deal gave Carlyle access to Saudi Arabia, a country of unimagin able wealth if one knew where to look. \"The deal gave us an enormously high profile in Saudi Arabia,\" recalls Norris.

Vinnell's hi story, before, during, and after Carlyle owned it, is a litany of covert oper ations, mercenary mis- sions, and cover-ups: right up Carl yle's alley. Carlyle, it seemed, was building an entire port folio of controversy, and Vinnell was the early centerpiece. The relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia has grown increasingly comp lex and co-dependent in recent years: the United States gorging itself on Saudi Arabia's cheap oil, and the Saudi's relying on American military support of the royal family. This give-and-take rela tionship has made navigating the post-September 11 political waters very tricky. Despite a near total lack of cooperation in the bombi ng campaign of Afghanistan and the investigation into September 11, Saudi Arabia remains the United States' chief ally in the Gulf. In response to Saudi Arabia's obstruction, senators have come out with strong rhetoric toward the Saudis, calling the regime co rrupt. Some have accused them of sponsoring terror, or at least doing nothing to abate it. Others have recommended an end to the alliance between the two nations. But the relationship, how ever tenuous, holds. Like the oil that trades hands between the two countries, the United States holds Saudi Arabia in a slippery, combustible embrace. Saudi Arabia's military dependen ce on the United States can be traced back to a Vinnell deal in 19 75 that would alter the nature of the alliance forever. Of all the military ties the United States has fostered with Saudi Arabia over the last three decades, perhaps no one company has d one as much to inject the American military machine into everyday life in Saudi Arabia than Vinnell. It was, and still is, an integral part of the Saudi military makeup."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"62 THE IRON TRIANGLE A Company with No Past Until Carlyle, through BDM, pur chased Vinnell in 1992, the com- pany virtually didn't exist to the public. Even though Vinnell claims to have been around since the days of the Great Depression, documentation of its history is nearly impossible to find. No publicity, no press releases, no news clippings. To this day, no one knows who the original owners were . Reports indicate that Vinnell, at one time a heavy construction company in Los Angeles, built Dodger Stadium. Then the comp any built some airstrips in Vietnam. But it wasn't until 1975 that the company mistakenly flew temporarily above the radar and into the public's view. In February 1975, the Associated Press broke a story that sent shock waves through Washington. A private American firm was hired by the Pentagon to train Sa udi troops to prot ect oil fields from potential aggression in the Mi ddle East. The news came just two years after the United States had pulled its final remaining troops out of Vietnam, and Americans saw the action as yet another ill-conceived invol vement in a foreign na tion's affairs. Only this time, it wasn't enlisted soldiers, working for the American Armed Forces. It was soldiers of fortune, civilians with guns. The $77 million contract, broker ed through the Defense De- partment, stipulated that Vinnell would hire 1,000 former Special Forces personnel, most of whom ha d recently served in Vietnam, to work with the Saudi National Guard, th e 26,000 men sworn to protect the royal family. Never be fore had a private company, em- ploying civilians, been deployed overseas to train a fo reign gov- ernment in battle tactics. But it would not be the last time. The news caused instant outrage on Capitol Hill. Congressmen accused the Pentagon of hiring \"mercenaries\" to develop the military of a country the United States may one day have to invade.

Henry Kissinger himself had th reatened an invasion of Saudi Arabia if the situation did not improve. With tensions rising between the two nations, the Vi nnell deal left lawmakers scratching their heads. Senator Henry Jackson, of Washington, demanded a congressional inquiry and was quoted as saying he was \"completely baffled,\" by the deal, adding that to his knowl- edge, the only threat to Saudi Arabia's oil fields had come from the United States itself. And we certainly weren't going to train the Saudi National Guard how to defend themselves against us, were we? U.S. companies had regularly scored contracts for training foreign nations in the use of American-made military equipment. But training men in battlefield tactic s and combat was considered off limits. It was viewed by many as a way for the government to get around laws that prohibit the Unit ed States from getting involved militarily in certain nations, an issue that was particularly raw following America's disastrous foray into Vietnam. It was a quiet, though expensive, way to further America's agenda abroad without committing its own troops. The type of men Vinnell was recruiting for the job led to con- sternation from others in the military training indust ry. This was not your typical service contract. The head of one security company at the time of the deal told Forbes that \"the whole thing stinks. You're talking about profe ssional killers, very senior Special Forces guys on this Vinnell contract. These aren't personnel specialists. They've got tremendous combat reputations. What kind of control does Vinnell have over them once they get over there?\" In the same article, William L. Hilger, corporate secretary for Vinnell at the time of the deal, told Forbes, \"This isn't anything new for us.

Defense Department spokesmen explained that the United States was trying to wean foreign governments off of U.S. military manpower, steering them toward private companies instead, which frees up active troops for more pressing action. It was the be ginning of privatization in the defense industry, a trend that woul d burgeon over th e following two decades and make Carlyle very rich. The Vinnell contract was characterized as a one- time training mission, a quick in-and-out. Twenty-seven years later, Vinnell is still well entrenched in Saudi Arabia, though Carlyle so ld the company in 1997. At the time, Vinnell spokespeople played down the significance of the announcement, defending themselves against claims that they were nothing but a ragtag group of mercenaries. One former U.S. Army officer, while waiting in line to apply for a position in Saudi Arabia (Vinnell had to hire on most of the men for the job due to a lack of experience in this type of work), told Newsweek \"We're not mercenaries because we're not pullin g the triggers. We train people to pull triggers.\" Hundreds of youn g men applied for the positions, which were advertised in local news papers. It was a truly frightening trend for Americans to watch evolve. Senator Henry Jackson finally got his congressional investigation into the Vinnell deal. And the resu lts were difficult to fathom. The probe yielded a stu nning contract clause th at barred Jews from working on the contract. Because of the sensitivities between Arabs and Jews, which ran very high in the mid-1970s, Vinnell had agreed to the obviously anti-Semitic clause. The investigation also turned up a suspicious $4.5 million agent's fee that investigators thought was a kickback to th e royal family. But"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" Vinnell's Executive Mercenaries 65 in the end, the anti-Semitic clause was dropped, and no charges were filed. Vinnell was free to go ahead with the highly contro- versial, highly profitable, contract in Saudi Arabia. Going Dark Then Vinnell disappeared again. Like a shadow at night, the company seemed to have the di sconcerting ability to disappear when it needed to, just go dark. It wasn't until the Iran-Contra affair that Vinnell resurfaced temporaril y. Richard Secord, a retired Air Force general who worked for Vinnell in the mid-1980s, was implicated as Oliver North's acco mplice in the we ll-known arms-for- hostages scandal. As part of th e voluminous press coverage of the scandal, Secord's background wa s thoroughly investigated, and it was found that he had previously worked for Vinnell. But Vinnell managed to successfully distance itself from the investigation and from Secord, who woul d eventually plead guilty to lying to Congress for his involv ement with Iran-Contra. But his involvement with Vinnell put the quiet compan y in the spotlight once again. In a brief, confusing, and rare public reference to the company, a Time magazine article in 1987 picked up the s cent of Vinnell when it reported that two Vinnell employe es may have been tangentially involved in a failed attempt to ov erthrow Granada's leftist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop. It was a bizarre revelation and few in the media knew what to make of it. What were these guys doing? And does this mean Vinnell was involv ed with plots of regime change? The story caused a few ripples of concern, no follow-up, and then once again the company dropped off the radar. How was such an intriguing company keeping so quiet? Why did the press never seem to follow up on these strange tales?

It had also paved the way for the cooperation between th e United States and Saudi Arabia in the Gulf War. Many of its empl oyees fought right alongside the Saudis, something the Pentagon had promised would never happen, in defending Saudi Arabia from Iraq's aggression. \"During the Gulf War, when a lot of co mpanies sent their people home, BDM (and Vinnell) did not,\" says Phil Odeen, then chairman of BDM. \"We kept our people ther e during war, and we got high marks from the Saudi's for that. I'm sure there were a lot of nervous people, but that was a big fa ctor in our cont inued success in Saudi Arabia.\" The U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia was growing steadily after the war. The Air Force was setting up shop indefinitely in Riya dh. BDM was increasing its business. By the mid-1990s, there were about 5,000 U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia, and close to 2,000 BDM and Vinnell employees. But while the royal family welcomed the presence of the American military mach ine in its backyard, many Saudi nationals did not. It is a dichotomy that exists to this day, in which the royal family's c oncerns do not mirr or those of the general population of Saudi Arab ia. And Vin-nell's presence in Saudi Arabia was exacerbating that problem. Both th e royal family and Vinnell tried to keep their deali ngs as quiet as pos sible. But with so many non-Arab employees work ing in and around Riyadh, the secret got out. Tensions steadily rose, and then, disaster struck. Hate Boils Over In November 1995, a car bomb ripped through th e Riyadh offices of BDM and Vinnell, killing seven peop le, including five Americans. Three spouses of Vinnell employees were injured in the blast. The offices that were targeted were those supporting Vin-nell's National Guard contract. \"One of them got cut up badly,\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" Vinnell's Executive Mercenaries remembers Odeen.

The radicals responsible for the explosion knew enough to a ttack the Americans where they worked. Vinnell was fooling nobody. The bombing set off a feeding fren zy by the national media. It was as though the Vinnell story was brand new, and everyone had questions. What were these people doing in Saudi Arabia? How did the Saudis know they were there? Why were they targets? The answers would turn out to be far more sinister than anyone suspected. According to one former board me mber of Vinnell, who wishes to remain anonymous, Vinnell had been a cover for the CIA for decades. Dating all the way back to 1975, the company was gathering intelligence on behalf of the U.S. government, by infiltrating the Saudi National Guard u nder the specious guise of military trainers. The board member also says that though the company was supposed to be nothing more than a front for covert intelligence gathering, the darn thing st arted making mo ney.

Today, Vinnell continues to do its work in Saudi Ar abia, since 1997 as a subsidiary of TRW. Whether it is a front for CIA activity is unclear. The company is among many that have come under political attack in the wake of September 11, and has been held up as an example of why it is so difficult fo r the United States to cut ties with the Saudis during the War on Terror ism. William Hartung, a foreign policy expert at the World Policy In stitute, in referring to Saudi Arabia's stonewalling of the United States following September 11, was quoted as saying \"If ther e weren't all these other arrangements—arms deals and oil deals and consultancies—I don't think the United States would stan d for this lack of cooperation.\" And it's not just Vinnell. The company led a tidal wave of private American military into Saudi Arabia. Today, it is estimated that between 35,000 and 45, 000 employees for outfits like Vinnell are living and working in Saud i Arabia. It is becomi ng nearly impossible to distinguish America's real mil itary from America's soldiers for hire. Carlyle has certainly had more pede strian investments than Vinnell, but it's had more controversial ones as well. It's safe to say, that after the purchase of Vinnell, Ca rlyle entered new territory that separated the compan y from other buyout gi ants like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.

Six years and a dozen or so buyouts after Rubenstein and Norri s joined forces at the Carlyle Hotel in New York, the firm had made some huge deals happen. It had also participated in some major flops. The company had stakes in 10 companies valued at around $2 billion."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"70 THE IRON TRIANGLE But the bottom line was that the Ca rlyle was not making the gobs of money its co-founders had hoped it would. And the time had come to kick it into gear. In 1993, Carlyle began a rapid transformation, from an eager young private equi ty firm into an inte rnational political and financial powerhouse. They brought in the high-priced, high- profile talent that would ultim ately define the company. They shed some of their old, bad hab its, one of which happened to be Steve Norris, the co-founder of th e company. And the result was nothing short of astounding. The moves the company made between 1993 and 1995 would cause some growing pains within the firm, but would also lay the groundwork for the new Carlyle— the company kicked off the training wheels and began to tear around the international business community. All of which began with a very important hire, and ended with a tragic but inevitable firing. To this point, the company was still operating without a chairman. Carlucci had settled nicely into his role as vice chair- man. Aside from opening the door s of defense to the Carlyle Group, he was now residing on the boards of an astounding 32 companies, not all of them owned by Carlyle. He was ridiculously well connected. His time was precious, and he was not highly involved in Carlyle's day-to-day deal making. While Carlucci was a serviceable figurehead, he was a bit detached, and didn't exactly reek of credibility. In referring to Carlucci's status value and lack of business acumen, Rubenstein was often overheard around the office saying, \"we all know what Frank is . . .\" Carlucci was invaluable in Carlyle's dealings in defense. But he was not the marquee name the company needed to really go global. Carlyle needed someone who could help raise money. Someone that would make the world stand up and take notice. Someone universally admired and respected. Someone like James A. Baker III."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Out of the Shadows 71 A Trophy Hire Baker, like Carlucci and Rumsfel d, attended Princeton University, and graduated in 1952. (The more you research the backgrounds of the key figures in Carlyl e, the more you end up at the same place: Princeton.) He then spent almost 20 years toiling with Houston law firm, Andrews and Kurth. But in 1975, he would enter American politics when he became the Undersecretary of Commerce for then President Ford. He would not leav e politics again for the next 18 years. During that time, he would lead presidential campaigns for Ford, Reagan, and Bush. He would serve as Reagan's White House Chief of Staff from 1981 to 1985, then secretary of the Treasury from 1985 to 1988. After leading George H. W. Bush to victory in the 1988 presidential election, he would be rewarded by becoming the nation's sixty-first secretary of state, a po st he would hold from January 1989 to August 1992. For th e last few months of Bush's time in office, Baker again became White House chief of staff, until January 1993, when after failing to get his boss r eelected, he resign edly cleaned out his office to make way for the in coming President Clinton, ushering in eight long years of Democrats in the White House. All told, Baker had been camped in the White House for 12 years straight. He was, and still is, a consummate statesman, and a steadfast Republican. Carlyle, with its offices at 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, just a few blocks from the White House, with a distinctly Republican flavor, made a compelling offer to Baker. It's not as if Baker had a paucity of offers either. Publishers urged him to write his memoirs. Rice University, in Baker's hometown of Houston, wanted him to run a foundation. Enron made overtures. So when the boys from Carlyle k nocked on his door, they weren't sure what to expect. Rubenstein, Conway, and Norris went to the White House to make their pitch during the White House transition, and in the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"72 THE IRON TRIANGLE waiting room, they ran in to David Rockefeller, the next in line to see the man of the hour. They kne w then that the competition for Baker's services was going to be stiff. After an hour-long meeting with Baker, however, they felt considerably better about their chances of landing the outgoing administration's biggest fish (aside from the presid ent himself, of course). Baker was intrigued by the offer, and he invited Richard Darman, Bush's outgoing budget director, to get involved. Darman convinced Rubenstein that if Carlyle wanted Baker, they were going to have to take him, too. He made it a package deal. On February 24, 1993, the news re lease hit the wire that Richard Darman, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, was joining the Carlyle Group as a managing director. Darman was a former executive at Shearson Lehman Hut-ton, Inc., and combined with his years of government service, would make an excellent investment adviso r in sectors heavily affected by government regulation, like energy, transportation, and insurance. Two weeks later, da ys after accepting another job consulting with Enron on overseas projects, James Baker became a partner at the Carlyle Group. Carl yle had officially appeared on the radar screen. Suddenly, every media outlet wanted to find out more about this quiet little merchant bank called the Carlyle Group, and it seemed that every writer had the same idea. Ten days after Baker was hired, Time magazine ran a story entitled \"Peddling Power for Profit.\" In it, the magazine referred to Carlyle as a \"Republican administration in exile,\" and reported that Colin Powell was also considering a job offer from the group. Powell and Carl ucci were very close from their days together on Reagan's National Security Council. Then the New Republic wrote a scathing cove r story later that year entitled \"The Access Capitalists,\" which portrayed Rubenstein as a nervous, paranoid wreck, obsessed with the media's portrayal of Carlyle. His fears proved warranted. In a New Republic article, writer Michael Lewis called the company a"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Out of the Shadows \"salon des refuses for the influenc e peddling class.\" It went on to say, \"[Carlyle] offers a neat soluti on for people who don't have a lot to sell besides their access, but who don't wa nt to appear to be selling their access.\" It was not th e kind of public relations coup Rubenstein was looking for when he went combing through the remains of the former Republican White Ho use. The stinging ac- cusations and acrid characterizations first levied in these articles would follow the co mpany to this day. Baker's hiring caused some waves inside Carlyle as well. Ruben-stein and Norris, who were running the firm at this point, were concerned that Carlucci would want out when Baker came on board. After all, it would be hard to argue that Carlucci would be of more value to the company than Baker. It seemed reasonable to assume that Baker might be Carlucci's boss. It wasn't clear which one was going to be more se nior. So in a preemptive case of ego-stroking, the firm decided to bring Baker in as a partner and promote Carlucci to chairm an. But former employees agree that the new title was pu rely for outside appe arances. One former employee would say of Carlucci, \"Frank was a good guy to have around, even though he was rarely there. But when we had a tough problem to tackle, no one said, 'Hey, let's go show this to Frank and see what he comes up with.'\" Carlucci and Baker also clashed over politics. When he was in the Carlyle offices, Carlucci was often overheard badmouthing former President Reagan, the man who appointed him national secu rity advisor and secretary of defense, saving him from the ni ghtmare that was Sears World Trade. Baker, a devoted Reaganite, didn't take lightly to Carlucci's disrespect. And Norris, a huge Reagan fan, would often remind Carlucci that it was Reagan who \"m ade you who you are,\" a jab that went unappreciated by Carlucci . But Carlucci and Baker's differences were miniscule compared to the other clashes to come in Carlyle's testosterone-l aden executive ranks.

It was a classic style clash. The two eventually had to work out an arrangement limiting Darman's role in management in order to get along. The tensions inside the co mpany were growing along with the company itself. As with any company that achieves success, Carlyle was finding itself at a crossroad between the past and the future, and the strain was weighing on its executives. Power struggles were common, and not the least bit private. The entire office saw management openly snip ing at one another. But no one could have understood the severity of the split that had opened up between fellow co-founders St eve Norris and Bill Conway. And this was the battle that would be the turning point in Carlyle's history, the winner defining how business would be done going forward, the loser left to carve out another future, away from Carlyle. A Chasm of Character Norris' relationship with Conway had almost completely deteriorated by the mid-1990s. There were ma jor differences of opinion on business issues. But this particular feud got increasingly personal over the years. Two me n could not have had mo re wildly disparate styles. Norris loved \"elephant hunting,\" wheeling and dealing, striking out occasionally, but all the while looking for the deal of the century, the one that would make them all rich beyond their dreams. He spent money lavishly, spoke out of turn, and followed his own instincts. Some call him me rcurial, a term he dismisses by claiming not to know the definition. Some call him a loose cannon. But no one denies the important imp act that Norris had on Carlyle. \"In the beginning, it was all Stev e,\" recalls one employee. \"David and Steve. Steve and David. That was all an ybody knew. Between the two of them, they got it all done.\""},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Out of the Shadows Conway, on the other hand , was conservative to a fault. He deplored wastefulness and railed against unnecessary expenses. He was a button-down businessman from New England. His father wrote the book on quality. . . literally. William E. Conway Sr., a world- renowned quality consulta nt, first wrote The Quality Secret: The Right Way to Manage in 1996, and followed it up with Winning the War on Waste: Changing the Way We Work in 1997. Conway's fa ther was also the first American CEO to embra ce the teachings of Total Quality Management (TQM), a corporate trend that would sweep through American business as capriciou sly as the Macarena affected American dance. Knowing this, it is not difficult to understand why Conway found Norris' foot loose style of deal maki ng deeply offensive. And why Norris felt threatened by Conway's staid approach to business. If you didn't know any be tter, you'd have thought Conway was playing the role of controlling father to Norris' troubled adolescent in Carlyle's internal drama. The rift between the two was da maging morale at the Carlyle offices. Without solidarity at the top, there was little to keep the younger MBA types from fracturin g and feeling put upon. One former employee remembers the office at the time like this: \"It was not a place where you sensed joy or even teamwork. There was no camaraderie. It was a tough place to be, where most of the economics went to the senior guys, and they didn't even like each other. It was hard for the younger guys to see how they were ever going to make money. A huge amou nt of the firm was going to a bunch of guys who didn't even do deals.\" Things got even worse, and even pettier. Norris recalls a painting he bought for about $5 ,000 for his wife at the time that hung in his livi ng room. Later when the Nor-rises hosted a cocktail party at their hom e, Conway and his wife saw the painting and were beside themselves. Apparently, Con-way's wife had intended to buy the same pain ting. According to Norris, the rivalry between the two had grown so fierce, that the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"76 THE IRON TRIANGLE Conways were convinced that Norris had bought the painting just to stick it to them. Norris claims he had no idea the Conways had designs on the painting. The petty jealousies and name calling of the super rich can be astonishing to the rest of us. By 1993, it had become appallingly clear that Norr is' time with the firm was going to end badly. Conway had begun to manage Carlyle's defense buyout business , taking over the day-to-day deal- making responsibilities that Carlucci had helped put in place. By this time, Norris was spending a gr eat deal of time and money set ting up shop in Paris as he worked a deal between the Prince Al- waleed and Euro Disney, an operation badly in need of some financing. Norris wasn't afraid to enjoy his successes, and when he was in Paris on business, he st ayed at the Ritz Carlton. He also availed himself of some free time while traveling on business. He didn't dwell on the minutia of high finance. He likes to tell a story that illustrates the difference in work ethics between him self and David Rubenstein. Bill C onway came in to the Carlyle of fices one weekend to pick up so me work. Rubenstein was there, huddled over his desk, feverishly writing a memo, with Norris re- laxing on his couch. Conway as ked Rubenstein what he was doing, and David said, \"writi ng a memo.\" Norris and Conway teased him, until Rubenstein aske d Conway what he liked to do to relax, to which Conway replied, \"play golf.\" Rube nstein then said, \"Think of this as me playing golf .\" Suffice to say given Norris' po- sition on the couch, he didn' t write memos to relax. While Norris was negotiating with Michael Eisner an d crew for the Prince's eventual $360 million invest ment into Euro Disney, he was racking up healthy expense reports. One day, in the midst of heated negotiations, he decided to go shopping. \"I could see that it wasn't going anywhere,\" Norris says of the negotiations. \"If I wasn't available, nobody could talk to anybody, and tempers would calm down, and we could reach a compromise .\" It was a decision for which Conway could never forgive him.

His partners were losing patience. \"He has no discipline,\" sa ys Stan Anderson, a partner at McDermott Will & Emery in Washington, who worked with Carlyle, especially Baker, on a few early deals. \"On a bike trip in Europe, Eisner lambasted him for bringing an undisciplined approach to the negotiations,\" says Anderson. \"He wa s basically living in Paris, and he was living too large.\""},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"77 Norris' Last Stand The final straw for Norris came when he drummed up a potential piece of business with a man he met in a sauna.

After a workout, Norris started up a conversation with an Italian businessman in the steam room of their fitness club.

Norris smelled a deal. \"He wanted to internationalize Ca rlyle,\" recalls Gu izzetti. \"To that point, Carlyle International didn't exist.\" Norris and Guizzetti struck up a friendship.

(\"If we had fi nalized the deal with the Bulgaris we would be multimillionaires right now,\" laments Guizzetti.) But in the end, the deal they decided to pursue was a buyout of IP, the retail unit of Italian oil company AGIP, a subsidiary of ENI. AGIP had built up too large a market share in Italy with IP, and the European Union was uncomfortable with the potentia l for monopoly, so the company was looking to sell off the retail ch ain of gas statio ns. Because the deal would have major political implications within Italy and the United States, Carlyle assigned a career diplomat to assist Norris. They called in Baker. Guizzetti, Norris, and Baker travel ed around Italy meeting with ENI's top executives as well as high-rank ing politicians. They secured time with then Prime Minister Carlo A zeglio Ciampi's general secretary. The met multiple times with Paolo Savona, the minist er of industry privatization.

The family had amassed a fortune through construction contracts and was looking to diversify. The name of the family was bin Laden. And the relationship Al Rahim established with the estranged family of Osama bin Laden would go on to be a long-term and very lucrative partnership. But not this time.

Co nway's cautious conser-vativism had won out, and Norris was to be part of Carlyle's past, not its future. Without Norris, the IP deal fell ap art. Carlyle backed out of the transaction at the eleventh hour, cl aiming that one of AGIP's oil refineries processed oil from Li bya, a nation embargoed by the United States for sponsoring terrorism. Norris says that Baker's law firm, Baker Botts, had already told Carlyle there were no legal problems with owning the refinery . But Carlyle wanted out anyway, apparently preferring to distance itse lf from deals that were initiated by Norris. \"We were very, very clos e to the deal,\" recalls Guizzetti. \"Then suddenly Carlyle changed, and the reason they gave about Libya being a terrorist st ate was stupid. It was the departure of Steve [Norris] that killed the deal.\" Norris went on to start up a series of independent investment houses on his own and met with tepid success.

Soliciting money from just about anyone who had it, th e company put together some powerful and unlikely bedfellows . And the little merchant bank from Washington, DC, began to grow in both stature and intrigue. Considering Carlyle's questionabl e investing record by the mid- 1990s, it is truly remarkable that th e firm was able to attract the type of talent it had. Midway through the 1990 s, the company had yet to cash in on anything but a few defense buyouts. Carlyle was getting pigeon holed as a defense company, and fast. Business press was criticizing it for being a bunch of tax-scamming crony capitalists, trading in on their time in gove rnment, and hitting up old friends for business. They had made a little money, but they certainly weren't lighting up the Scoreboard. One magazine reported that Conway's wife was pestering him about seeing some profits they could take to the supermarket. Th en everything started to change. With Baker on board, Rubenstein turned his focus to raising money. Truckloads of money. Rubens tein began work on a fund that would eventually be called Carlyle Partners II, designed to focus on aerospace, defense, heal thcare, telecommunications, and insurance. The idea was to parlay the newly acquired political expertise that Carlyle had gained through the hi ring of Darman and Baker, and invest in industries that are heav ily dependent on federal regulation. This way, Carlyle could cash in on its ex-politicos in two ways: first, to help them raise money by gi ving speeches at home and abroad, packing the house with high net worth individuals; and, two, to leverage their relationships with lawmakers to gain insight on the direction of policies that affect their target industries. It was a brilliant strategy that wa s about to make all of them very, very rich."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Breaking the Bank 83 Soros' Millions The goal for the fund was $500 milli on, a relatively modest sum in private equity circles, but five tim es as much as Carlyle had ever raised. Until this time, Carlyle's strategy was to first identify a deal, then round up the investors needed to make it happen. There was often a great deal of leverage in volved, and the debt loads on some of the deals caused ongoing probl ems for Carlyle. This time would be different. After rounding up almost $150 million from some banks, pension funds, and Richard K. Mellon & Sons (an original investor in Carlyle), the company was going after an investor that could contribute both m oney and fame and get them over the hump. They were going after George Soros. The Hungarian-American Soros al ready had the reputation of being the most prescient and successf ul investor in the world. His Quantum Fund was admired aro und the world. His investment record was unassailable. But on September 16, 1992, he cemented his place in finance history by shorting the British pound, and nearly bringing down the British banking system. That day came to be known as Black Wednesday. Shorting is a way of bettin g that a stock or curre ncy will lose value, usually over a relatively short am ount of time. The investor borrows the stock or currency, then sells it, expecting to buy it back after the value decreases, thus pocketing th e difference. It's a very risky investment strategy, because should th e stock or currency increase in value during that time, the short i nvestor may be forced to buy back the stock with money they may or may not have, resulting in huge losses. People who short are universally reviled in investing circles, because they want companies and cu rrencies to fail and thus lose value. Often times, they take an active role in making that happen, circulating rumors and various untruths that will undermine the stock. It can be a ra ther dirty business. In 1992, Britain was in the mids t of a tough recession, and the British pound was struggling to maintain its value against"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"84 THE IRON TRIANGLE other currencies. Then prime minister John Major had an- nounced a comprehensive plan to restore confidence in the pound. Publicly, he called it hi s \"over-riding objective.\" But Soros had other ideas. Soros placed a $10 billion bet against the pound, enough to cause the value of the currenc y to bottom out on it s own when the public saw that such an important and knowledgeable investor had lost confidence in the currency. In essence, Soros was betting against Major and his ability to prop up the sagging pound. It has been called the highest stakes poker game in history. Currency speculators were either to believe in Major's ability to save the pound or Soros' intent to evisce rate it. Soros won. On Black Wednesday, the pound crashed, cri ppling the British economy and embarrassing the prime minister. Soros made a profit of $950 million. He would later be known in England as the man who made a billion off the pound's coll apse. Needless to say, George Soros wasn't exactly a popular bloke in the United Kingdom. So when Soros agreed to become a limited partner in Carlyle's new fund exactly one year after Black Wednesday, he was bringing far more than just $100 million. He wa s bringing added credibility and a reputation for making gobs of mone y. George Soros didn't make bad investments, so the Carlyle Group must be for real. Soros was also jump starting a fund that would go on to be the most successful in Carlyle's history. It is unusual fo r a private equity firm to issue a press release announcing an inve stment into a fund.

Suddenly, raising mone y was surprisingly easy. Investments were pouring in from the likes of Amer ican Airlines, Gannett, Citibank, and others. By the winter of 199 4, the fund had already reached $400 million, and the target was raised to $650 million. Then in the fall of 1995, the goal was again raised, this time to $750 million. The money was starting to pile up. The Carlyle Group had everyone from Soros to Colin Powell helping them out, talking to investors, and opening wallets. In Carlyle's previous fund, Carlyle Partners I, the defense in- vestments Carlyle had made in the la te 1980s were finally starting to cash out in the mid-1990s, and the payment was handsome.

Part of Carlyl e's strategy in identifying invest- ments—the compan y was looking at more than 1,200 potential deals a year at this point, bu t rarely invested in mo re than four or five— was to avoid getting into an auction with all of the other big names in private equity, like Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts or Forstmann Little & Co. As it turned out, the big guys weren't interested anyway, because the aer ospace industry was in a major slump. So Carlyle joined forces with a maker of rocket fuel named Thiokol, and each picked up half of Howmet for $100 million. The two companies leveraged the rest of the purchase, which ended up costing $750 million in total. They all agreed they had overpaid. Carlyle then applied a formula that would result in many successes for them in the future. They st ructured a sweeping system of financial incentives, from the executives to the shop floor workers.

They taught every last employee in the company, all 10,000 of them, ho w to manage cash flow. They dangled a great big green carrot. And it worked. In the first two years Carlyle owned th e company, sales increased by 25 percent while expenses fell consistently. By the fall of 1997, just two years after the buyout, Carlyle had managed to pay down more than half the debt that was incurred during the buyout and was ready to take Howmet public. The initial public offering was valued at $1.5 billion. Carlyle was entitled to half of that, making their $10 0 million investment worth $750 million. Not bad for a two-year turnaround. The boys at Carlyle had learned much since the early days of Chi-Chi's and Caterair. Things were starting to co me more easily for them. Carlyle was on a serious roll now. They decided to hit the global scene, using the same formula they had applied domestically: hire ex-politicos to open doors and wall ets. By this time the company had George Bush Sr. casually working for them on and off as a \"senior advisor.\" (Bush and Rubenstein had become very close friends at this point.) So it wasn't difficult to hook former U.K. Prime Minister John Major, as well. Fresh off his 16 years in government, the last seven of which were as prime minister, Major was another huge score for Carlyle. He had been America's ally during the Gulf War, which put him largely in the good graces of Carlyle's Middle East investors. And Carlyle had plans to create another massive buyout fund, this time targeted at European companies. The fit was perfect, and in late 1997, John Major became a member of the Carlyle European Advisory Board—just months after he left his post as prime minister in May. The hiring of Major set up another of Carlyle's global ironies. It was, of course, Major that fought so ha rd to restore the value of the pound during Britain's di sastrous recession in the early 1990s.

But the road to the Bush White House was fraught with land mi nes for Carlyle. As Bush cam- paigned, the press examined his an d his father's relationship to Carlyle, and the result was a seri es of stories about dubious in- vestments, seemingly crooked kic kbacks, and near -miss scandals, any one of which, had they hit their mark, could have brought Carlyle crashing back down to ea rth. Instead, as it had done so many times before, Carlyle deftly traversed the tricky terrain and reached the Bush White House relatively unscathed. A Bush Bonanza While Carlyle had amassed a formidable employee roster by the late 1990s, it wasn't until Ge orge W.

After all, it was Carlyle that had placed young Bush on the board of Cat-erair when he needed to beef up his busine ss resume (though he would later eliminate any reference to the disastrous Caterair debacle in his official bio).

Not ones to leave anything to chance, Carlyl e did what they could to ensure their desired outcome to the 2000 elections. The company was among the top political contributors in the defense industry in the 2000 election cycle. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Carlyle cont ributed more th an $427,000 to political candidates in 2000. A to tal of 84 percent of those con- tributions went to Republicans, ma king Carlyle the most partisan of the top 10 defense contributors. George W.

While the tantalizing prospects of one of their own setting up shop in the White House filled their dreams, the campaign of George W.

Over time, the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"' Buying Bush Complicated web of bribes and kickbacks was uncovered, and the result was the Carlyle name ge tting dragged through the mud again. After he lost his bid for reel ection to the Connecticut State Treasurer's office in November 1998 , but before he left office in January 1999, Paul J. Silvester was a busy man. He invested $800 million in state pension funds in a series of eleventh-hour placements during those two frene tic months. This inordinate amount of action for a lame-duck tr easurer raised eyebrows at the FBI, and the Bureau began an in vestigation. The Bureau wanted to know where the money had been placed, and why Silvester was in such a hurry to invest it. Silv ester told the press that there was nothing irregular about the inves tments, and the whole thing was nothing but \"a politically motivated witch hunt,\" contrived by one of his former political rivals. Nevertheless, Silvester resigned his newly acquired position at an investment firm called Park Strategies to concentrate entirely on the investigation. His new boss at Park Strategies, Wayne Be rman, told the press early on that Silvester \"resigned for personal reasons.\" It was one of the last times Berman would talk to the press on the matter. But the investigation turned when ag ents realized that at least two of the investments that Silveste r had made during the period in question were placed through Park Strategies, the same firm that had hired Silvester upon his leaving the state treasury. It worked like this: Silvester landed a high-lev el position at Park Strategies almost immediately after placin g the investments and leaving office. On the face of it, it appeared as if Si lvester was securing his future by investing the money through Park Strategies, which in turn had agreed to hire him. Incidentally, Park Strategies pl aced $50 million of the money that Silvester invested into an Asian buyout fund run by Washington, DC's most connected company: The Carlyle Group. By the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"94 THE IRON TRIANGLE summer of 1999, the focus of the investigation shifted onto whether Silvester had shuttled the money through Park Strategies in return for getting a job. The fact that the money had ended up with Carlyle seemed irrelevant. But every week, media scrutiny on Wayne Berman increased. Park St rategies LLC was a consulting firm that Berman set up with former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican from New Yor k. Berman worked in the first Bush administration's Commerce De partment and wa s also one of the largest fund raisers to the George W. Bush campaign, having raised more than $100,000 for the cause. He was thoroughly connected in DC. Soon, the focus of the investigat ion again shifted. The FBI now wanted to know if Silvester had received illegal kickbacks, either from Berman or his clients like the Carlyle Group, in exchange for his placement of the $800 milli on, of which $50 million went to Carlyle. Federal officials subp oenaed information from Park Strategies and Carlyle, as well as dozens of other investment firms. Homes were searched, files were confiscated, and dozens of inter- views were conducted as part of the investigation. And finally, Sil- vester cracked. On September 2 3, 1999, Paul Silvester pleaded guilty to charges of corruption. Over the ensuing months, a com- plicated ring of kickbacks would result in fines and indictments for several of Silvester's family me mbers, including his brother and brother-in-law. Together, the S ilvester family had been accepting bribes for years, buyi ng themselves boats a nd shiny new coats of paint on their houses.

According to Bernar d Kavaler, director of communi- cations at the Connecticut Treasury Department, the U.S. attorney's office has not named th e firms involved because the case is still pending.

Just how much busi ness has George W. Bush done with the Carlyle group? As it turned out, the Silvester a ffair led reporters to another questionable association between George W.

En- terprising young reporters were more interested in establishing the elusive connection between Berman's dealings with Silvester, and his generous campaign contributio ns to Bush. It was a connection they failed to establish. But the hunt for questionable campaign contributions led them to anothe r financial supporter of Bush: Tom Hicks. In February 2000, Harper's Magazine wrote an epic piece laying out the George W. Bush's business history in excruciating detail. It scrutinized the relationship betw een Bush and Thomas O. Hicks, a self-made Texas millionaire whose company, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, was among Carlyle's bigg est competitors in the private equity business.

Frustrated with the conservati ve strategy of years past, Hicks felt the University was leaving money on the table and had big ideas on how to change that. Th e answer was the P-word: privati- zation. Hicks fought hard to create a private company through which the assets of the University of Texas would be managed. It was a bold strategy, but one that fit with the larger trend toward privatization sweeping the nation. By 1996, University of Texas I nvestment Management Company (UTIMCO) was born. Tom Hicks was quite pleased wi th the creation of UTIMCO, but the public and press were a bit miffed. As it turned out, the nonprofit company no longer had to divulge details on the investments of the Univ ersity's money to the public; due diligence reports were not made available to the press. No one knew what the University's money was being spent on anymore. It was an untenable situation for the University's investors. But it went on for years. Over time, the press and polit ical action committees forced UTIMCO to open up its books, for fear that investments were being made based on political leanings and personal relationships. They found what they had su spected. Among the reams of Republican-friendly re cipients of investments was, perhaps not surprisingly, the Carlyl e Group. Weeks after Bu sh became governor in 1994, the University's board of regents placed $10 million into Carlyle Partners II, the fund that holds the bulk of the company's defense investments, as well as the lion's share of its controversy. It was a stunning example of how big business and politics are never far apart. Tom Hicks, an appointee of George W. Bush, had helped place $10 million of the University's money wi th a firm that not only had employed George W. a year earl ier (via Caterair), but at the time was also considering employing George H. W. Bush. It was classic Carlyle, commingling business and politics to the point that the lines are blurred. Hicks told Harper's that he di dn't know of the relationships within the Carlyle Group when he made the investment. In fact,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Buying Bush 101 he went on to say that he suspec ted internal problems within the firm (most likely the ongoing fe ud between Norris and Conway) and had reservations about the investme nt from the onset. Which begs the question: Why invest in them at a ll? Especially in light of the fact that Carlyle is the su pposed competition to Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. Tom Hicks, like so many others that do business with Carlyle, declined to be interviewed for this book. It appears that UTIMCO's invest ments were at least partially politically motivated, rather than purely financially motivated. And that is the power of Ca rlyle. When an investor commits capital to a Carlyle fund, are they making a sound financial investment or a strategic political cont ribution? The inherent confusion works to Carlyle advantage. Baker's Battle Many political experts thought that the revelations about Herman and Hicks would do serious damage to George W. Bush's presi- dential campaign. It's impossible to know just how much of an effect the news had on voters. But however great the damage was, it paled in comparison to the value of the money that Berman and Hicks would contribute to Bush's camp aign over time. Miraculously, Carlyle managed to tiptoe th rough the landmines relatively unscathed, aside from some un wanted attention. However, speculation over Carlyle's political leanings and what the company had or had not done to further Geor ge W.

From the moment he was called into duty on November 8, 2000, until the day that Gore conceded the election on December 13, Baker dedicated himself tirelessly to winning the Florida vote for Bush. Having sat out the previous two campaigns, including"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"102 THE IRON TRIANGLE George W. Bush's, Bake r jumped into the fray with both feet. It was obvious he hadn't lost a step. After taking a plea for help from Bush's campaign manager, Baker flew to Florida immediately to assess the situation. So many things were riding on this vote. Bake r, already as partisan a politician as there is, had many re asons to want the younger Bush in office. For one, there was the eight long years he had spent in exile since the Clinton administr ation took office. The hatred that Republican stalwarts harbored for Clinton and Gore cannot be overstated. Then, there was Ba ker's fierce loyalty to his close friends in the Bush fa mily. And finally, the ne w life that Baker had carved out for himself since leav ing the public's eye— that of a lawyer at Baker Botts and a globe -trotting deal maker for Carlyle Group—would benefit substantially if a close family friend were in office. The motiva tion was stacked. Baker brought the same te nacity into Florida th at he brought to his previous five Republican presiden tial campaigns. He relentlessly went to work attacking the Gore cam p's motto, repeated ad nausea during the fight for Florida, of \"Count all the votes.\" Baker was quoted in Jeffrey Toobin's definiti ve book on the subject, Too Close to Call: The Thirty-Six Day Battle to Decide the 2000 Election, as saying, \"We need a PR strategy, we're getting killed on 'Count al l the votes.' Who the hell could be against that?\" Republicans, that's who. Baker wanted to limit the amount of vote s that were recounted, knowing that with Bush already in the lead, the fewer votes that are recounted, the better Bush's chances of winning. Recounting them all could only lead to bad things. But the Gore camp decide d not to get too greedy by asking for a full recount throughout the st ate. Instead, they asked for a selective recount, only in the most controve rsial counties. Gore's people thought the tactic would be seen by the public as generous and fair, but they forgot that the campaigning was over, and the public's impression no longer mattered."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Buying Bush 103 Baker turned the tables on Gore, filing a federal lawsuit claiming that the Gore camp's selective recount request only included counties in which Gore was likely to pick up votes. Many of the lawyers at work with Baker felt fi ling a lawsuit would look bad, and ultimately be a losing strategy. But Baker knew better. It was a litigious long shot, and ironically oppos ed their real goals. The fact of the matter was that the Baker/Bush camp had no intention of recounting all of the votes. They didn't want any of the votes recounted. As far as they were concerned, they had already won the election. Baker carried out the operation in Florida with military precision. He spoke to George W. Bush often, sometimes four times a day. Though Baker kept Bush informed, he was in no way taking orders from the much younger presiden tial candidate. Baker was in complete command, calling all the shots. He managed to somehow sway the opinion of the court and Florida lawmakers against a recount, painting Gore as a sore loser, desperate to gain an edge. He held press conferences, claiming to be acting to \"preserve the integrity and the consis tency and the equality and the finality of the most important civic action that Americans take: their votes in an election for the presid ent of the United States.\" Over time, Baker developed an ov erused mantra of his own: The vote in Florida was counted and recounted, referring to the automatic recount of machine ballots. This was a claim, which Toobin points out, was entirely untru e. The automatic recounts that took place in Florida simply rechec ked the totals that machines had spit out. It did not pu t the ballots through th e machines again, the true meaning of a recount. Eighteen counties failed to properly recount their votes, accounting for mo re than a quarter of the total votes cast.

George Herbert Walker Bush and his son George W. Bush have repeatedly and flagrantly crossed this border of impropriety since the younger Bush became president in 2001. And the compan y creating this ongoing breach of the public's trust is the Carlyle Group. Money: A Bi-Partisan Goal The ascension of George W. Bush to the presidency wasn't all good for the Carlyle Group. It was true that the new president had close ties to the company and would be in a position to send all kinds of business their way. It could even be sa id that the new president might be inclined, or at least not disinclined, to push policies and projects that might fa tten his father's, and in a less direct way his own, bank account s. But along with those newfound advantages for Carlyle came the c ontinued, and at times increased, scrutiny of its behavior; fevered charges of cronyism; and the occasional accusation that the co mpany was not a private equity firm at all, but rather a shadow government pulling the strings in Washington. Some of these concer ns are more legitimate than others, but there was another mo re immediate issue: Who were they going to hire now that all the Republicans were going back to work? Carlyle had been cultivating an unseemly reputation as a Republican boys club, whose membership privileges included the thrill of deal making on a global scale and a he fty paycheck at the end of the month. Indeed, it was di fficult to spot any Democrats on the employee roster aside from Rube nstein himself, and he was 20 years removed from service by this time. But as always,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Family Business Carlyle already had a plan. It wa s time once again to pick over the bones of an outgoing administration. And this time, they were looking to harvest a host of Democrats. In the spring of 2001, just a few months after Clinton had cleared out his desk, Carlyle snatched up both outgoing Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman William Ken-nard and outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt. The annou ncements of their hirings were less than a week apart. Both men are loyal to traditional democratic doctrine. Levitt has long been known for his concern for the individual investor, fighting to defend the little guys from the scourge of corporate greed. In one master stroke, indeed in one week, the Carlyle Gro up went from being a dark and mysterious GOP lair to a bright and open bipartisan buyout firm with a heart. It was Rubenstein at his best, fully aware of pub lic opinion, and ready to make whatever changes were needed. Incidentally, the company had also picked up two of the best minds in the telecommunications and securities businesses. But like most of Carlyle's high-prof ile hires, it seems that Kennard and Levitt did not come without baggage. Kennard in particular had the apparent stink of a quid pro quo deal. Over the course of 2000, SBC Communications, the parent company of the Baby Bell Southwestern Bell, was pursuing two major agendas simultaneously. On one hand, SBC was eager to buy into the Saudi Telecommunications Company (STC), as the Saudi Arabian Kingdom took the stat e-owned and run telephone monopoly private. In so doing, the company had contracted Carlyle to help them, because, as one European investor noted, \"Carlyle had Saudi Arab ia completely sown up . They controlled the deal flow in and out.\" Two years earlier, Carlyle had hired Frank Yeary, former head of the media and telecommunicatio ns investment group at Salomon Smith Barney.

Th en in 1998, he had helped Car- lyle and a partner buy some ca ble properties in Virginia and Maryland from SBC for $250 million, then turn around and sell them six months later to Comcast for $735 million. He was a legend in telecom. And he was very close to the folks at SBC. Carlyle was in the perfect position to facilitate the deal in Saudi Arabia, which they did, extremely quietly, in August 2000. The deal was so secretive, it was near mi raculous that anybody go t wind of it at all. But an Arabic daily ca lled Asharq al-Awsat reported that the Saudi government had chosen SBC Communications to buy between 20 percent and 40 percent in the Saudi Telecommunications Company, which had an estimated value of $12 billion at the time. The deal was termed a \"strategic partnership.\" Any number of telecom companies woul d have wanted in on it, but with Carlyle on its side, SBC never ha d any real competition. At the same time, SBC was ch affing under newly established restrictions on telecommunications companies at home in the United States. Under the Telecommun ications Act of 1996, regional bell operation companies, or Baby Bells, had to make their local lines available to the national long distance companies before they would be able to enter the long distance market themselves. Baby Bells, by nature of the telecommun ications structure in the United States, had been government sanctioned regional m onopolies since Ma Bell was broken up. Each Baby Bell owned and operated all of the local telephone lines for a given geographic area. Like Bell Atlantic in the Northeast, Pacific Bell in California, or Southwestern Bell in Texas. But the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was supposed to change all of that, opening up each region to competition. The tricky part was ensuring the Baby Bells would allow new competitors in to use th eir lines, thereby taking customers away. A bureaucratic nightmare of line request forms, fees, and fines for noncompliance emerged. Not surprisingly, new competitors had an impossible time securing lines from"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Family Business the Baby Bells, who protected their turf with arrogance and defiance of the new law. It was a mess. Baby Bells, like SBC, abused th e spirit of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 repeatedl y. When competiti ve local carrie rs requested lines for a new customer , the Baby Bells would drag their feet, with little or no incentive to help a new competitor steal their customers. The fines for this anticompetitive behavior, levied by the FCC, were nominal and harmlessly factored in as a cost of doing business by the Baby Bells. Many of the would-be competitors in local markets dried up and died waiting for lines they knew they would never get from the likes of SBC. SBC was among the biggest offenders, drawing millions in fi nes and testing the patience of regulators and potential competitors alike. That's why jaws dropped when SBC filed an application to begin delivering long-distance servic e in Texas at the end of 1999. Competitors that had b een trying to get a fair shake in Texas, waiting in vain to gain access to SBCs local line s, couldn't believe it. The law clearly stated that a Baby Bell must open its local lines up to competition before it would be allowed to enter the long distance markets. SBC had not done that ye t. So the U.S. Department of Justice recommended in February of 2000 that the application be rejected on the basis that SBC had not sufficiently opened up its network to competitors. But the Department of Justice (DOJ) doesn't get the final say in the ma tter. The FCC, chaired by William Kennard, does. SBC voluntarily withdrew the a pplication, and reapplied a few months later. After being embarrassed by the original rejection, the company pointed to the recommendation of the Texas Public Utilities Commission (TPUC) to approve the application, which the DOJ had summarily dismissed. The TPUC, happens to be chock full of Bush appointees, a nd SBC was one of the largest single corporate contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. \"What this sounds like is, [the DOJ] is telling the Texas state commission it doesn't kno w what it's doing,\" said"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"110 THE IRON TRIANGLE Michael Balhoff, managing director at Legg Mason, in an inter view with the Houston Chronicle. To the shock and dismay of many, SBC's application was ultimately approved by William Ke nnard and the FCC in the summer of 2000, and SBC was free to deal long dist ance in Texas. And in January 2001, the FCC approved SBC's appli cation to offer long distance in Oklahoma and Kansas as well, making it the first Baby Bell company to offer interstate se rvice since the breakup of Ma Bell. The approval was handed down on Kennard's last day as FCC chairman. Less then two months later, Kennard was working alongside Frank Yeary and the boys at Carlyle. It was all sounding awfully familiar. The hiring of William Kenn ard brought with it the same appearance of impropriety that the hiring of Frank Carlucci brought. It looked quite a bit like the hiring of Paul Silvester at Park Strategies after he left the office of the treasury of Connecticut, and that of Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss after she left her post at the World Bank. Here were men and wo men that made in dustry-altering decisions while in powerful posit ions and public office, then put themselves in a position to profit fr om those decis ions months after they left their posts. Did Kennard act with fore knowledge of his employment with Carlyle? And what ha ppened to his \"cooling off\" period? Kennard was on fire when he accepted a job at Carlyle. Only William Kennard, and maybe a few f olks at Carlyle, know the answers to these questions. Perhaps that's why they all declined to be interviewed for this boo k.

Though the press missed the ironies and improprieties of Le vitt and Kennard, they seized on the mother of all impropriety: The Bush fam ily stood to gain financially from policy decisions George W. made while in office. The New York Times finally got in on the game, writing a revealing article in March 2001, detailing the relationships between the current administration and the Carlyle Group. It was the firs t most people had ever heard of this company, and it scar ed the pants off of them. In the article, Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity is quoted as saying: Carlyle is as deeply wired into th e current administration as they can possibly be.

A natural confusion arose over the nature of Bush's visits to foreign digni- taries. Were the trips a form of commercial diplomacy? Were they social visits? Was the former president representing U.S. interests? Or was he just there on behalf of a moneymaking behemoth by the name of the Carlyle Group? The same questions arose in the United Kingdom over the actions of John Major, who accompanied Bush on the trips to Saudi Arabia. Of greater concern was that Major and Bush Sr. were meeting with less savory characters than the roya l family. They ha d been to see the bin Laden family, the wealthy re latives of a known terrorist (by this time Osama bin Laden was unam biguously viewed as a terrorist threat to the United States, and estranged from his family). It wasn't clear what either of the former world leaders were up to. And it was this confusion, on the part of both the public and foreign world leaders, that played to Carlyle's advantage. Carlyle repeatedly reaped the benefit of blurred boundaries, with foreign business owners and world leaders not knowing whether Bush Sr. represents American political interests or Carlyle's financial interests. That was, and still is, a very powerful tool for Carlyle. But while everyone was waiting for a conflict of interest to arise in the elder Bush's business with Saudi Arabia—as indeed it would later—the real controversy was happening half a world away, in the tiny peninsula off the Eastern coast of Asia: Korea. Sowing Carlyle's Seeds in Korea On May 27, 1999, former president George H. W. Bush touched down in Seoul, South Korea, for a whirlwind business trip. His visit was celebrated in Seoul, with newspapers hailing his arrival, excited about the possibility of Am erican investment in Korea in the wake of the Asian economic crisis of 1998.

He also met with the chairman of South Korea's Financial Supervisory Commission, Lee Hun-jai, chairman of SK Telecom Choi Tae-won, and the president of a financially ailing As ian conglomerate called Halla. Again, it was classic Carlyle: a measured blend of business and politics that sufficiently blurred the boundaries between the two. Carlyle's spokespeople, when questioned by the press about the impropriety of the senior Bush working for a defense contractor while his son is president, often retort by explaining that all the senior Bush does for them is ma ke speeches about world events. They say his job is to pack the house, get the crowd excited, then step aside while Rubenstein pries open their wallets. But this trip to South Korea was much more th an that. Bush Sr. wasn't just giving speeches to rooms full of investors; he was doing business, one on one, with CEOs and politicians. These were not motivational talks about global politics. This was business. And he was good at it. Carlyle was really starting to get busy in South Korea now. That same spring, the company hired Michael Kim, a Harvard-educated native Korean, to open its brand new Seoul offices. Kim is the son-in-law of aforementioned Park Tae-joon. Carlyle and nepotism seemed to go hand in hand. Immediately following Bush's visi t, Korean newspapers lauded an announced $1 billion investment in the country by Carlyle, including a buyout of a division of Mando Machinery, a South Korean industrial firm, owne d by Halla, the same company Bush Sr. had visited weeks earlie r.

But back in Korea, Michael Kim wa s working to put toge ther another massive deal. This time Carlyle was look ing to buy one of the few healthy banks left in Korea, KorAm Bank. Korea, like the rest of Asia, had suffered terribly from the economi c crisis that swept through the continent in the late 1990s. Many of the country's banks had faltered and collapsed. But KorAm was an exception. It had taken some hits, like all businesses in Korea, but had re mained solvent. The Korean governme nt had a vested interest in keeping the firm in Korean investors' hands. But Carlyle had other ideas. Carlyle gained approval for the b uyout by the KorAm board, thanks to its high-powered connections with Park Tae-joon, who became prime minister of South Kor ea in January 2000 and lobbied on Carlyle's behalf. But when Park re signed just four months after taking office, amid allegations of corruption, Carlyle had lost its regulatory advantage. It was go ing to be difficult to get the government to approve the deal w ithout Park Tae-joon's involve- ment. So the firm then struggled to get the deal, which was to be for a 40 percent stake in the bank, approved by Seoul's Financial Supervisory Commission, the chairman of which Bush had met with a year prior. Carlyle was slippi ng, losing their political edge because of the unexpected and un seemly departure of Park Tae- joon from politics. They were losing the deal. But after some months in self-imp osed exile, Park Tae-joon, still a popular figure in Korea despite the allegations of corruption against him, came through in the end, rising from the ashes and l obbying the key government officials to allow the deal to happen, according to press accounts of the deal.

It wa s the best financial news Korea had seen in years, and it was largely Carlyle's doing. But the mirth would soon come to an abrupt halt. A Foreign Policy Flop When George W. Bush was sworn in to office in January 2001, everything changed suddenly and dramatically. One of the first things that young Bush did as president was call off the missile control talks that the Clinton administration had been conducting with North Korea for years. Bush revealed open hostility toward North Korea, calling it a rogue state that cannot be trusted. It was a stunning reversal of American polic y, which heretofore had been to use diplomacy in mitigating Nort h Korea's military aggression toward South Korea. And it wa s coming from a man that had virtually no experience in foreign affairs. The nation watched in disbelief. Not surprisingly, the backlash from Bush's brash actions was felt far and wide. North Korea accused the United States of planting a \"time bomb\" in the midst of thei r fragile negotiations with South Korea. The South Korean government received Bush's actions as a rebuff to their safety, knowing th at North Korea would be more inclined to attack without Washington's involvement. Kim Dae^ung, South Korea's president, was forced to turn to the European Union for help in fi lling the sudden gap the United States had created in the peace process between North and South Korea. He was also getting lambas ted at home for not being on top of the situation in Washington. Bush had made the South Korean s look bad, and undermined their safety, all with one fell swoop. Analysts speculated that Bush was motivated by his desire to create a national missile defense system, part of his campaign platform.

As absurd as it sounds, peace between North and South Korea, and between North Korea and the United States, did not further his broader agenda in the White House. Regardless of his rationale, he had created an international crisis on just his second month on the job. This also threatened Carlyle's extensive investments in South Korea, which would plum met in value as inst ability in the region increased. The threat of war alwa ys sends local economies into a tailspin, much like America's ec onomy since Se ptember 11. And Carlyle could kiss regulatory ap proval for future deals goodbye, with South Korean officials feelin g slighted by the United States, and particularly George W. Bush. At first it seemed as if this was a rare case in which being associated with the Bushes was not going to work to the benefit of Carlyle. But that would not prove to be the case. Adding to the disarray George W. 's stance toward North Korea was causing, the unionists at KorAm bank were starting to rebel against their new American owners, acc using Carlyle of being nothing more than a speculative investor that had already broken its promise not to intervene with management. Employee representatives at the company be lieved that Carlyle intended to restructure the company, probab ly threatening jobs. And the union was rallying against Carlyle. The situation was dire. Carlyle had just ploughed nearly $1 billio n into South Korea, and the man they all thought would be so good for business, George W. Bush, was on the verge of screwing it all up. Something had to be done. On June 6, Bush reversed course . In a statement, the president announced plans to resume negotiations with North Korea, es- sentially picking up where the Clin ton administration had left off.

Just like that, the si tuation was all better. But what could have created the sudden change of heart? On June 10, 2001, just a few days after the welcome announce- ment by President Bush, the New York Times reported that the sen- ior Bush had forcefully argued fo r his son to reopen negotiations with North Korea shortly before President Bush did just that. The article opened: In an effort to influence one of his son's most crucial foreign policy decisions, former President George Bush sent to the president through his aides a memo forcefully arguing the need to reopen negotiations with North Korea, according to people who have seen the document. It was the first time that anyone had tangibly seen the influence of the father on the son. According to the article, Bush Sr. felt that his son was being unduly influenced by the Pentagon, and that he should adopt a more moderate stance toward the Korean peninsula. He also spelled out that the hard-line policy toward North Korea was undermining the government in South Korea, thereby hurting U.S. interests in North Asia. White House spokesman Ari Fleisc her confirmed th e report in the Times, and told the press that the argument for reopening ne- gotiations came originally from Donald Gregg, former ambassador to South Korea under th e first Bush administra tion. Fleischer said that Gregg had sent a memo to th e senior Bush, who then sent the memo to national security adviso r Condoleeza Rice, who then passed along \"the thoughts in the note\" to the president. It was a way of watering down the connecti on between George W. Bush and his father, even though it has been widely reported that the two speak regularly.

It seemed the former pres ident was everywhere at once, acting as counsel to his son, ambassador to Korea, and businessman for Carlyle. For a man that had supposedly retired from pol itics, Bush Sr. was awfully busy. Bush of Arabia The folks at Carlyle refuse to talk about how ex-president Bush is compensated for his work on their behalf. Former employees, however, say that he is invested in the funds that he helps raise and place. If that is the cas e, the senior Bush's involvement in foreign policy regarding South Korea is a clear conflict of interest. He stands to gain financially from deci sions that he is urging his son to make. It doesn't get any more eg regious than that. But the press missed the connection at the time. Indeed it was a difficult connection to make, given that Bu sh Sr.'s trips to Korea and his work on behalf of Carlyle was kept very quiet. Then another story hit the front pages. Bush Sr. was at it again. This time the New York Times re ported that in July 2001, just months after he had advised his son on North Korea, the elder Bush had placed a call to Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on behalf of his son, to reassure Sa udi Arabia's leadership that his son's \"heart is in the right place,\" when it comes to Middle East policy.

According to one of the accounts, President Bush was in the room when his father made the call.\" The news was stunning, and it undermined the credibility of George W. Bush on foreign policy. Who was making the decisions in the White House? Why didn't Bush Senior run for president instead? But more than that, the news of Bush Sr.'s continued in- volvement in foreign policy wa s undermining the credibility of both Bushes ability to keep politics and family business apart. Like the situation on Korea, Carlyle's extensive business interests in Saudi Arabia and throughout the Middle East, were in grave danger if the younger Bush kept pi ssing off the roya l family. So the Senior Bush needed to step in and preserve the relationship once again. It was testament to the sway ex-president Bush still held over foreign affairs. And it didn't look good. The reports of Bush Sr.'s actions sent the Washington, DC-based public advocacy groups into a tizzy.

And according to press re ports, Bush Sr. s till requests and receives CIA briefings often.

Wrong. Crusader's Crusade By 2001, the world outside of Washington, DC, was becoming dimly aware of the Carlyle Group. People would chat about them casually at cocktail pa rties, noting th e intimidating employee roster and joking about shadow government s and X-files episodes. But it was all speculation at that point . No one in the media had put together the apparent conflicts of interests the Bushes had cultivated in Korea an d Saudi Arabia. Yet people had a vague and nagging notion that th ere was something wrong with the way Carlyle was conducting its business. They were just having trouble putting a name to it. Everyone was looking for the proverbial smoking gun. Little did they know that it was literally a smoking gun they would find. The saga began in the summer of 1997, when Carlyle was raising money like mad, hiring world leader s, and, in gene ral, becoming the dominating global private equity firm it is today. Among the investments Carlyle had targeted for its Carlyle Partners II fund— the one chock full of defense, aer ospace, and security companies— was a maker of armored vehicles named United Defense. The owners of United Defense were FMC Corp oration and Harsco Corporation— the same company that Carlyle had unsuccessfully and hostilely tried to acquire six years earlier. All Ca rlyle got for its $63 million back then was one lousy board seat with Harsco. But what a valuable board seat that ha d suddenly become.

But at the last minu te, Harsco and FMC decided instead to sell to the Carlyle Group, whic h had submitted a low-ball bid of $850 million, 15 percent less th an General Dynamics had been offering. It turns out that rumors had begun to circulate around Washington, DC, that General D ynamics was going to run into antitrust issues. Eventually, the rumors grew so loud that General Dynamics was forced to back out of the bidding, and Carlyle was there to pick up the scraps. It was another stunning victory for Carlyle. Despite paying a fire-sale price for United Defense, Carlyle was not without its challenges regarding the new ac quisition. Since 1994, United Defense had been working on a massive gun: a mobile howitzer that can fire 10 rounds of 100 pound shells per minute, 25 miles in distance, cruise at 29 mph, and reload on the battlefield. The \"Crusader\" was the most advanced artillery system the U.S. Army had ever conceived. It is the kind of weapon that makes the United Stated unbeatable in large scale, op en warfare, lobbing multiple shells at varying trajectories so that they rain down at their desired target at the same time. It is a fearsome we apon. A killing machine. It was also United Defense's future cash cow. But times had changed considerab ly since Crusader was first conceived in the early 1990s. In fa ct, the very nature of war had changed and had left Crusader behind. The gun had two very se- rious problems: It was too big, and it was designed to fight a type of battle that no longer presented its elf to the U.S. armed forces.

The problem was that at 60 tons each—plus a supply vehicle that weighed an additional 50 tons—the Crusader was impossible to deploy quickly enough to hot spot s around the world. It could not be airlifted by any of the massive cargo planes employed by the Army. And shipping Crusader would take too long to reach the ephemeral battles to which the Army had recently grown accustomed. The United States had learned that lesson the hard way, when it took more than a mont h to ship its Apache helicopters to the action in Kosovo in 1999, a conflict that lasted only 78 days total. The United States wasn't fighting long, drawn out land wars in Europe anymore, and Crusader's effectiveness for the new breed of fighting was being called into question. \"For the foreseeable future, no one is going to stand out in the open and fight the American forces,\" says Andrew Krepinevich, a member of the 1997 National Defense Panel that panned the Crusader and executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. \"The U.S. will be fighting in more complex terrain, like mountains and cities, and in those areas there is not a lot of use for heavy artillery of this natu re. The big challenges are how do you get there fast and how do you fight people that won't fight you out in the open.\" The panel re commended the Crusader program be dramatically scaled back, and some, including Krepinevich, wanted it canceled outright. A cancellation of the Crusader program would have been cat- astrophic for United Defense. The company had just lost out on a crucial contract with General Dy namics to build tracked fighting vehicles for the army. It was a deva stating loss, leaving Crusader as the saving grace for the company. Losing the Crusader"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Big Guns 125 contract, originally valued at $20 billion, would jeopardize the future of the company and woul d be a mighty hit to Carlyle's premier fund, Carlyle Partners II. The momentum against the Crusad er was building rapidly by the turn of the century, as more de fense analysts recognized the importance of mobile armed forc es that could be deployed in- stantly. When General Shinseki took over as U.S. army chief of staff in June 1999, he preached the go spel of a faster, lighter army in which the Crusader played no role. Even George W. Bush, when running for office, questioned th e utility of the Crusader. In a Campaign speech in 1999, Bush recognized the end of the Cold War as an opportunity to \"skip a generation of technology.\" It was all part of an effort to build an army \"not by mass or size, but by mobility and swiftness,\" accordi ng to Bush. The future of the Army was at hand, an d almost everyone was on board but United Defense. The Crusader had become the poster child of the old, lumbering Cold War army. Time ma gazine said of the Crusader, \"the kind of war it was meant to fight is already obsolete.\" The Wall Street Journal called it a \"dinosaur.\" By all accounts, the Crusader was headed for the scrap heap. But Carlyle was just getting started. The effort the compan y put forth to save their precious gun would illustrate exactly how the Iron Triangle of defense, government, and business work together to the benefit of all three. Carlyle had been built to prevail in situations like these, when the large amounts of money were riding on the decisions of a few men in public office. It was time to call in a few favors. Slimming Down In the fall of 1999, General Shinse ki told United Defense that if they did not reduce Crusader's weight to under 42 tons, light enough to be transported on a C-17 cargo plane, he was going to"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"126 THE IRON TRIANGLE kill the program. He gave the company thre e months. \"We were given a bogey,\" says Doug Coffey, vice president of corporate com- munications for United Defense. \"W e were told that we had to be able to put any two of the Crusad ers on a C-17, so you could take a complete system anywhere in the world.\" United Defense worked furiously through the winter to meet the goal. They redesigned the engine, stripped armor, and reduced ammunition. They worked through the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. By 2000, th ey had made their designated weight: 42 tons on the button. In the meantime, Carlyle and United Defense were waging a political battle for the Crusader. Shortly be fore Carlyle bought the company, United Defense organized a political ac tion committee (PAC) through which the co mpany would funnel co ntributions to key lawmakers. In the cycle leading up to the 1998 elections, United Defense made campaign contributions of only $49,500. But by 2000, under Carlyle's leadership, the co mpany's PAC had spread around more than $180,000 to more than 70 senate and house members. The bulk of th e company's largesse went to politicians on the house and senate arms committees. And of ten, a good deal of money found its way to the house and senate members whose districts were expected to participate in manufacturing the Crusader. It was also uncanny how United Defense pl anned to build manufacturing facilities for the Crusad er in the backyards of key members of the arms committees, creating jobs a nd wealth that hadn't existed before. These are the kinds of things that get politicians reelected, and get businesses what they want. Rick Santorum, a Republican sena tor from Pennsylvania, netted $10,000 from the United Defense PAC in 2000. York, Pennsylvania, is home to a United Defense manufactur ing facility. Another manufacturing facility for Crusader was lo cated in Minnesota, home of republican senator Rod Grams, who took anot her $10,000 from the United Defense PAC. Republican representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma received $6,000 from the United Defense"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Big Guns 127 PAC. Watts's corner of Oklahoma, which incl uded Fort Sill, was targeted as a factory site for assembly of Crusader. Watts was also a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Carlyle was being thorough and strategic, and they were starting to make up ground. Reports of Crusader's death had in fact been greatly ex- aggerated. When reporters question Carlyle representatives about the potential for people like Frank Carlucci to lobby his good friends in the Pentagon and the White House, they receive ad- monishments and are made to feel unpatriotic for even suggesting the thought. One Los Angeles Time s reporter was excoriated by a Carlyle spokesperson, \"I assure you [Carlucci] doesn't lobby. That's the last thing he'd do. You' d have to know Carlucci to know he'd never do that, and you'd have to know Rumsfeld to know it wouldn't matter.\" The company often aggressively defends itself from accusations that it lobbies or has any undue influence over key decision makers. But concentrating on whether Carlyle \"lobbies\" or not is a red herring argument, designed to lead reporters on a wild goose chase for the elusive definition of lobbying. Besides, according to offici al records, Carl yle does in fact lobby. According to the Center for Resp onsive Politics, the Carlyle Group spent more than $1,200,000 in 2000 hiring lobbying firms to wage battle on Capitol Hill on behalf of United Defense. What Carlyle representatives are really saying when they assure the public they do not lobby is that their high-pr ofile hires like Carlucci, Bush, and Baker don't personally register as lobbyists and work to drum up support for various programs. That, of course, is true. But to say that the Carlyle Group does n't lobby is simply not true. Rubenstein, a former lawyer, ha s been playing a cat-and-mouse game of semantics with the press for years. Does the Carlyle Group register as lobbyists? No. Do they hire lobbying firms to do it for them? Yes. Do they influence key lawmakers and help shape policy? Of course they do. People like Carlucci"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"128 THE IRON TRIANGLE don't need to lobby, in the traditio nal sense of the word. They al- ready know the lawmakers involved in key decisions, and the law- makers know them. There ar e memorandums and meetings. There are unspoken understandings that are reached over a drink and a wink. \"It's impossible to say when people working for Carlyle are wearing more than on e hat,\" Peter Eisner, managing director at the Center for Public Integrity, told me. It would be ludicrous to imagine George Bu sh Sr. fighting it out in the trenches with all the other regist ered lobbyists. But does George Bush Sr. have a say in policy decisions made by this White House? That much has already been proven. Regardless of your definition of lobbyin g, in the case of the Crusader, Carlucci and his team did lobby, and they lobbied hard. According to the Wall Street Journal, Carlucci called Defense Un- dersecretary Jacques Ga nsler multiple times to have the program spared. The Wall Street Journal al so reported that Carlucci called defense think tanks and pleaded with them not to write anything negative about Crusader. Carlyle hired recently retired senator Dan Coats and his former staffer, a retired army colonel named Frank Finelli, to start stumping for Crusader. In an interview, Greg McCarthy, a spokesperson fo r now retired representative Watts, said this of Carlyle an d Finelli: \"Carlyle's strength was within the DOD. As a rule someone like Frank Carlucci is going to be able to have access, and memb ers of congress are going to have an open door to Frank. Without question, they have influence. But the fact that this is a ll known mitigates that influence to some extent. They are not able to hide. But they have other, less visible people. They have these staff types that ar e behind the scenes; they work in the dark. Guys like Frank Finel li who know everything about the army and about Capitol Hill.\" One of the lobbyists who Carlyle hired to work congressmen on Crusader had this to say of Carlyle: \"I felt that in this effort, they were like any other lobbying group, aside from the fact that they are not one. They ha ve been able to r each into Congress,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Big Guns 129 and there was a lot of contact with the Pentagon. They definitely influenced the decision-making process.\" Lobbying laws in the United States are vague and ill defined. Lobbyists are required to register with the federal government and disclose their clients and the pa yment amounts publicly. But what exactly constitutes lo bbying is much less clear. The formal definitions of lobby ar e: (1) to conduct activ ities aimed at influ- encing public officials and especially members of a legislative body on legislation; and (2) to attempt to influence or sw ay (as a public official) toward a desired action. By those definitions, contributing funds to various lawmakers, calling the defense undersecretary to plead for the Crusader, and hiring $1,200,000 of lobbying groups on United Defense's behalf would indeed be considered lobbying. It's hard to see what Carlyle di d in this case as anything but lobbying. What they did was sa ve their precious gun. Between the slimming down of the gun, the massi ve lobbying effort, and the scaling back of the original order from 1,200 to 480, the Crusader survived. When Bush's proposed defense budget for 2002 was finally handed down in June 2001, it included funding for Crusader. It was nothing short of a Hail Mary pass w ith no time left on the clock for Carlyle. And within two months of the decision by Bush, the Carlyle took its first dividends fro m United Defense, a windfall of $289 million. The Crusad er was saved for the time being, but opponents continued to fight to have the program cancelled. The raging debate would not be ultimately settled until long after September 11, 2001.

Though the company de fended itself from claims of undue"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"130 THE IRON TRIANGLE influence, public ad vocacy groups were sure Carlyle had unmiti- gated and unethical access to th e highest ranks of government. The problem was, proving those ki nds of things was nearly im- possible. Interested parties would have to tail Frank Carlucci for months, and even then, all you would learn was whom he met with and when, not what was said. It just wasn't the kind of thing a reporter could spend time on. But then there was a break. Judicial Watch, the public interest law firm that investigates government corruption and repeatedly called for the resignation of Bush Sr. from the Carlyle Group, has been using legitimate and legal means to prove to the American public that the Carlyle Group has the ability to access and influence key deci sion makers in the current administration. By utiliz ing the Freedom of Information Act, a law that gives the right for all citizens to request and receive information from the federal government, Judicial Watch has been able to obtain a smattering of doc uments from the Department of State and the Department of Defense that illustrate the sway Carlyle holds. Many of Judicial Watch's requests were ignored or delayed indefinitely, heightening their susp icions of foul play and forcing them to file a lawsuit against the state and legal departments to obtain the requested documents. Finally, they saw a few documents coming their way. But only a few. Judicial Watch grew increasingl y frustrated as they were con- sistently stonewalled in their re quests. But even the limited docu- ments that the state an d defense departments did release show the power, reach, and influence of Carlyle. The first documents Judicial Watch received are correspondences between Carlucci and William Perry, another former secret ary of defense, and Car-lucci's good friend Donald Rumsfeld, the current secretary of defense. In the letter to Rumsfeld from Carlucci and Perry, which is on Carlyle letterhead, the two former secretaries of defense urge Rumsfeld to heed the findings in a report the BENS Tail-to- Tooth Commission wrote on reducing infrastructure"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Big Guns 131 Spending in the Pentagon. Both Carlucci and Perry served on the BENS Commission: The BENS Commission stands for the Business Executives for National Security, and the suggestion, as the letter shows, is to \"cut the cost of defense infrastructure and re- invest in modernization a nd other priority programs.\" Dear Don, Thanks for lunch last Friday. It was great seeing you in such good spirits even if you are \"all alone.\" We thought it useful to follow up on our discussions on the need for reductions in the infr astructure of the Depa rtment— and how that might best be done. Over the past three years, the two of us have served as senior advisors to th e BENS Tail-to-Tooth Commission. We believe the Commission has addressed th e most critical areas that must be tackled if we are to cut the cost of defense infrastructure and re- invest the savings in modernization and other priority programs.

The mere fact that Carlucci could have such unimpeded access to such an important decision is disturbing enoug h, but the nature of their correspondence is wholly inappropriate, given the obvious fi- nancial benefit of Carlucci should Rumsfeld follow his advice.

Montenegro is among the more outspoken republics in th e formerly war-torn region of Yugoslavia. After allying with the United States in isolating, and eventually removing Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic was now pressing his case for Montenegrin inde- pendence in the Balkans. The m ove was widely opposed by the international community, including the United States, because of fears that the move toward indepe ndence would again destabilize the region, which had been at war for years and had finally reached some semblance of peace. Djuka novic came to the United States to press his case in early Febr uary 2001 and was rebuffed by Secretary Powell in his reque st for a meeting. The Bush administration had taken a stand against Montenegrin in- dependence, fearing it would in fact plunge the entire region back into war. Djukanovic did manage to meet, howev er, with Frank Carlucci of the Carlyle Group. And the following is Car-lucci's plea to Colin Powell on Montenegrin independence: Dear Colin, We congratulate you on your great st art as Secretary of State. We recognize that there is no shortage of serious issues seeking your attention, but one of the earliest will certai nly be Montenegro's relationship to Serbia.

Best wishes, Frank C. Carlucci Chairman Why Frank Carlucci, the chairman of a private equity firm, would be meeting with leaders of war-riddle d nations is anyone's guess. It is easy to see how anyone would be conf used as to what role he has in Montenegro's independence. Is he acting on behalf of the United States? Or as a Carlyle executive, since the letter is on Carlyle letterhead and signed \"Chairman.\" But it is ev en more baffling why he felt it necessary to directly lobby the stat e department for support of Montenegro's independence in the first place. Perhaps his thinking was that the more inst ability in the Balkans, the more need for war and the more weapons that are sol d. All of which benefits defense contractors, like Carlyl e. Although unsubstantiated, that could be the intent behind Carlucci's overtures to Powell. Regardless, Powell's administrators had the good sense to recommend against the inappropriate meeting, recognizing that Carlucci would likely have more to talk about with Powell than just Montenegro.

An Extraordinary Day The skies over Manhattan that morn ing were astonishingly blue. It was one of those rare days of la te summer, not a single cloud in the sky, temperatures so mild and inviting, you almost didn't mind getting up and going to work. It was an elec tion day in New York, but there was no discernible difference in the way the city went about its business, aside from the buzz on the local news stations. Trucks honked industrial-strengt h horns, echoing down canyons of steel and glass. Cabbies swerved and jerked their bright yellow Fords from stoplight to stoplight on rush hour streets. Businessmen sidestepped delivery men on frenetic sidewalks, everyone hus tling, with somewhere important to be. And the sky, unambi guously blue, looked down silently at the city below. At 8:43 A . M ., American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston tore through the daily cacophony of New York , ripping a path down midtown Manhattan, roaring toward the no rth tower of the World Trade Center. Many in midtown would shrug off the incident, wondering why a jumbo jet was flying so lo w, and maybe speculating with a friend, but never suspecting the ultimate destination. It wasn't until the thick, dark stripe of smoke from the explosion billowed and writhed against the clear blue sky on the southern horizon, that most New Yorkers knew something was terribly wrong.

Newscasters were initially baffled, as if their ne tworks had suddenly come across footage of the first pl ane hitting the tower. Suddenly the dreadful logic of what was unfolding quickly took hold, and the grim reality dawned on the city's collective conscience at once, with inescapable reality: It was a second plane, and we were under attack. The fear that descended on the city was immediately palpable. Without speaking, everyone not directly involved in the horrifying events taking place at the Trade Ce nter asked themselves the same questions: How long will this go on for? Is my building safe? Who do I know in the Twin Towers? Will God ever forgive us for this? The city was instantaneously shut down. Bridges and tunnels were sealed off. Subways stopped runnin g. Airplanes were redirected and landed at alternate airports. Then, at 9:43 A . M ., American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, leaving little doubt that the attacks were ongoing.

In any circumstance, a confluence of such politically complex and globally connected people would have been curious, even newsworthy. But in the context of the terrorist attack s being waged against the United States by a group of Saudi nationals led by Osama bin Lade n, the group assembled at the Ritz-Carlton th at day was a disconcerting and freakish coincidence. At 10:05 A . M ., the world stifled a collective cry as the south tower of the World Trade Center, once th e mightiest building on earth, seemingly evaporated behind a shro ud of dust and smoke.

Twenty minutes later, the north towe r met the same fate as its twin, pounding mercilessly in to the streets of do wntown Manhattan, leaving thousands dead and hundre ds more fleeing for their lives.

Also in the works was a massive in crease in the Pentagon budget, $33 billion, in time for the Depart ment of Defense's 2002 fiscal year, beginning October 1, 2001. Cashing in on Tragedy The partners of Carlyle—Rubenstein, Carlucci, Conway, and D'Aniello—stood to gain the most of anyone in the company, pos- sibly in the country. Those four wo uld have to shake off the devas- tation of September 11, and look fo rward to their big payday. It is not an exaggeration to say that Se ptember 11 was go ing to make all of them very, very rich men. This is the reality of the business they chose. And in the defense in dustry, war time is boom time. \"Capitol Hill is prepared to do whatever the Pentagon wants,\" said Gordon Adams, a budget official in the Clinton administration, in a New York Times piece a week after the attacks. Indeed Capitol Hill provided enough money to the Pent agon to make the budget woes and tough decisions of the past ye ar suddenly irrelevant. Among the weapons programs that had been gi ven new life was, of course, the unkillable gun: the Crusader. The money was pouring in now and there was no long er any reason to deny the army its precious gun. After the attacks, opponents to the gun were silenced, not wanting to assume the political liabilities of killing a weapons program in the midst of war. On September 26, just two weeks after that attacks, the army signed a $665 million contract with United Defense for the next phase of the Crudader's development.

It was highly unlikely the war in Afghanistan would still be ongoing by that time. And nothing had changed the original argument ag ainst the gun: it was still too heavy, even at 42 tons, and the need for this ty pe of open battlefield weapon was waning, as the fighti ng in the caves and tunnels of Afghanistan was demonstrating. But none of that was important anymore. There was enough money to go around for everyone. \"A rising tide does lift all boats,\" said John Williams of the National Defense Industrial Association, in a New York Times article. The defense landscape had cha nged so dramatically, and so thoroughly, after September 11 that Carlyle quickly and wisely decided it was time to take United Defense public weeks after the attacks on the America. On October 22, 2001, the company filed an S-l registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, planning an initial public offering before the end of the year. In the filing, United Defense listed th e following as its reasons for selling shares to the public: 1. The U.S. defense budget subm ission for fiscal 2002 reflects an 11 percent increase over fiscal 2001. 2. Defense procurement and development accoun ts are growing proportionately with overall na tional security spending .and are expected to continue growing in the near future. 3. The Bush administration's recently published Quadren nial Defense Review calls for retaining the current force structure and increasing investment in next-generation technologies and capabilities to enable U.S. military forces to more effectively counter emerging threats. 4. The terrorist attacks of Se ptember 11, 2001, have gener ated strong congressional s upport for increased defense spending."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"144 THE IRON TRIANGLE William Conway would later go on the record as saying \"No one wants to be a beneficiary of Se ptember 11,\" in a report in The Nation entitled \"Crony Capitalism Goes Global.\" Nevertheless, Carlyle took United Defense public on December 14, the day after Congress passed the defense author ization bill allowing for full funding of Crusader pr ogram going forward. On that single day, Carlyle took profits of $237 million. On paper, the company had made three times that amount. All the time spent lobbying government officials, calling on ol d friends, and greasing the palms of congressmen had finally paid off. Crusader was alive and well. Bin Laden's Business In the mean time, Carlyle was de aling with yet another public re- lations crisis, and this one dwarfed all that came before it. Carlyle had been doing business with doze ns of families and businesses throughout the Middle East since the early 1990s. And they had been extremely successful in the region. So successful that they had garnered a reputation for having a tremendous amount of influence over the deal flow in the area. After all, the company had been running the Saudi Economic Offset Program for years, a government funded program designed to encourage foreign investment into Saudi Arabia, unde r the condition that a portion of the profits be reinvested in Saudi Arabia. In a sense, Carlyle had become the gatekeeper to fore ign investing in Saudi Arabia. Not many people knew any of this at the time of the September 11 attacks. But by the end of September, the general public would know far more about Carlyle's busin ess than anyone at Carlyle was comfortable with. In the weeks following the attacks, the name Osama bin Laden leaped onto the forefront of America's consciousness as public enem y number one. Storefronts"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"hung pictures of his likeness, cut out of newspapers, with headlines of \"Wanted: Dead or Alive.\" Not since the Red Scare of the 1950s had the United States had a more tangible opposition. It seemed that the entire nation was united in its hatred of one man. Then, on September 27, the Wall Street Jo urnal ran a story entitled \"Bin Laden Family Is Tied to U.S. Gr oup.\" That group, of course, was Carlyle. Carlyle had a relationship with the bin Ladens that began in the early 1990s, when they tried to put together a deal for the Italian Petroleum (IP) company. At the time, Basil Al Rahim, a young Carlyle associate, was traveling from Saudi Arabia to Amman to Bahrain, to United Arab Emir ates, drumming up support for Carlyle's forthcoming international funds. \"I met with 101 different potential clients in 16 days,\" recalls Al Rahim. \"No one had really ever heard of us.\" Sin ce that time, Carlyle's business in the Middle East blossomed. One of the clients that Al Rahim helped secure was th e bin Laden family, wh ich owned a $5 billion construction business by the name of Saudi Binladin Group. The bin Laden family consists of mo re than 50 brothers and sisters, all the progeny of Mohammed bi n Laden. Osama had his Saudi citizenship revoked in 1991, and wa s reportedly cut off from his family. Since his father's passing, Bakr bin Laden became the head of the business and the family, and as such he committed money to Carlyle on several occasions. It was a fruitful relationship for both parties involved. But now, all of that had changed. The article in the Wall Street Jour nal pointed out the most stunning and atrocious irony of Carlyle's history: through Carlyle, the bin Laden family was in a position to make mill ions from the war being waged against their own brother. The news that George Bush Sr., James Baker III, and Fra nk Carlucci had visited the bin Ladens in recent years also stunned the American public. It was, in fact, the Carlyle Partners II fund in which the bin Laden family"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"146 THE IRON TRIANGLE was invested. The same fund that he ld United Defense, as well as a host of other defense holdings. Carlyle told the press that the bin Ladens were only in for $2 million, a relatively small amount of mone y considering the whole fund was worth $1.3 billion. But one bin Laden fa mily financial representative says the number was mu ch larger. And Al Rahim says that earlier in his time with Carlyle, which ended in 1997, the bin Laden family had several times that amount invested in the company. Regardless of the actual amount, the irony ultimately proved too much for Carlyle, and by the end of October, they severed ties to the family, liquidating their holdings. A month had elapsed between when the news of Carlyle's bin Laden connection emerged and the company divested their millions. During that time, every major news outlet had pick ed up the story. Carlyle was sustaining significan t collateral damage and was ill- equipped to handle it. Up to this point, Rubenstein had always acted as the company's spokesperson to the press. But this was too much. Calls were pouring in from around the world. Everyone wanted to know about the company that c onnected the Bush's and the bin Ladens. It was a disaster. A Congresswoman's Accusations The company hired a public relations specialis t for the first time in its history, but he was overmatch ed. The press was digging faster and deeper than ever before, dredging up all of the old controversies and conflicts of in terest. From sources of varying credibility came claims th e now all too fa miliar charges of cronyism, influence peddling, and dirty deali ng in the Middle East. It was all the same accusations the press had levied before, just in greater volume than ever. But it wasn't until an actual electe d official called out Carlyle by name that the company started fighting back."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"9/11/01 147 In a March 2002 interview with a Be rkeley, California, radio station, Representative Cynthia McKinney, a Democrat from Georgia, spoke publicly what was already making so many Americans uneasy: \"Persons close to this administration are poised to make huge profits off America's new war.\" She went on to say, \"An administration of questionable legitimacy has been given unprecedented power . . . We know there were numerous warnings of the events to come on September 11 ... What did this administration know and when did it know it. . . Who else knew, and why did they not warn the innocent people of New York who were n eedlessly murdered . . . What do they have to hide?\" In the address, McKinney named th e Carlyle Group as an example of the cronyism she was talking about. McKinney was implying that the Bush administration knew the attacks were coming, allowed them to happen, and wa s now reaping the profits, both financial and political, through its connections to the Carlyle Group. The comments resonate d with a growing group of cynics on the Internet and spread like wildfi re across the Web. For weeks there had been reports of an intelligence breakdown and fore knowledge of the attacks in the major news outlets. McKinney was simply giving a voice to what many already suspected. And she was absolutely lambasted for it. Carlyle spokesman Chris Ullman, in easily his most entertaining, not to mention effective, public statement in his six months on the job asked the press if McKinney had \"said these things While standing on a grassy knoll in Roswell, New Mexico?\" And the public lashing was on. Representative Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, said McKinney has \"demonstrated in Washington a total lack of responsibility in her statements.\" Senator Zell Miller from Georgia called her \"very dangerou s and irresponsible.\" Kathleen Parker, a nationally syndicated columnist, called McKinney's statements \"idiotic\" and bordering on treason. Parker suggested the advent of a new award, the McKinney Award, \"for people too stupid to serve in public office.\""},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"148 THE IRON TRIANGLE Parker also pointed out that it was McKinney that publicly ad- monished New York Mayor Rudol ph Giuliani for declining Prince Alwaleed's offer of $10 million in aid after the September 11 at- tacks. McKinney offered to find appropriate charities for the Prince's money if he still wa nted to donate it. He didn't. McKinney would eventually back off a little from her comments, issuing a statement saying \"I am not aware of any evidence showing that President Bush or member s of his administration have personally profited from the attacks of 9/11. A complete in- vestigation might reveal that to be the case.\" In the end, McKinney received vindication when it became clear that a complete investigation would indeed be necessary, as enough information had emerged that indicated Bush's prior knowledge of the attacks. But McKinney's over-the-top comments probably did more damage than good in the drive to address the truly important issues surrounding the Carlyle Group. Charles Lewis, ex ecutive director of the Center for Public Integrity, said the comments undermined the important work the center has been trying to complete in regards to Carlyle by making a \"caricature of the issues that may make it easily dismissible.\" McKinney was certainly an easy target to discredit. And by August her previously loyal cons tituents voted her out of office. But at least part of what she said in that in terview was dead on: Persons close to the Bush administration were in fact in a position to gain financially from the September 11 attacks, as the United Defense IPO had already demonstrated. Bu t there were other ways the company was getting rich off the even ts of that day as well. Lots of ways. And September 11 was turni ng into an outright bonanza for the boys at Carlyle. Beyond Big Guns Most of the American public first heard of anthrax a week after the attacks on the World Trade Center, when a granular substance"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"was found in letters sent to NBC news in New York and the New York Post offices. But the dead ly virus soon found a permanent place in the American terrorist lexicon when every day brought new cases of infection. First it was an editorial assistant at the Post who noticed a blister on her fi nger: cutaneous anthrax. Then an assistant to NBC anchor Tom Brokaw found a lesion. Then a photo editor at The Sun in Boca Raton. Ma il sorting facilities were shut down. News media outlets were on edge, and stopped opening their mail. In many ways, the anthrax scare had Americans more on edge than the September 11 attacks. It seemed more insidious, like we were seeing the beginnings of what could ultimately be a far more deadly act of terror. And the terror spread rapidly, from mail processing facilities in Trenton, New Jersey, to the Ha rt Senate Office building in Washington, DC. The country was ill-equipped to handle this kind of an attack, psychologically or logistically. Building after building was shut down, crippling postal service and severely inhibiting the Beltway's political machine. The government gave mixed messages on a daily basis, encouraging citi zens not to panic, while at the same time warning of the lethalit y of anthrax. It was a confusing, fearful time for the whole country . But once again, Carlyle had the uncanny ability to be at the right place at the right time, and profit from the situation. Carlyle owned 25 percent of a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company called IT Group, an envi ronmental and hazardous waste cleanup specialist. At the time of the anthrax attacks, IT Group was in bad shape, suffering under the weight of nearly $700 million worth of debt, and on the verge of declaring bankruptcy. In the wake of the anthrax attack s, IT Group scored a number of cleanup contracts with anthrax-in fected buildings. Among the new work coming their way was the cont ract for the Hart Senate Office Building and the Trenton postal facility. The company had 400 workers on site at various locations working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to clean up anth rax spores. It was snapping up contracts with government agencies left and right, like the General"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"150 THE IRON TRIANGLE Services Administration, the Army Corp of Engineers, the Center for Disease Control and Preventi on, and the U.S. Navy. Richard Conte, vice president and treas urer of IT Group would tell reporters that the anthrax work \"is very good for our bottom line.\" For a moment, it looked as if IT Group was going to miraculously save itself from bankruptcy and em erge one of the few winners in the war on terrorism. But the anthrax scare turned out to be much more limited an attack than was originally feared. In the end, IT Group still de- clared bankruptcy and was bought out by the Shaw Group for $105 million plus close to $95 million in assumed debt, a price that presumably would have been much lower had anthrax never burst on the scene and given IT Group some last minute business. Carlyle had saved at l east some of its bacon. Then rumors spread around the Internet that Carlyle was also invested in a company called Bioport, which he ld the only gov- ernment contract on an experimental and highly controversial anthrax vaccine. The company has retired Admiral William Crowe, a man who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff while Carlucci was secretary of defense. The two know each other well, but Carlyle's involvement with the company is unknown. Both companies are private, and as such have no obligation to disclose investments to the p ublic. Carlyle Group spokesperson Chris Ull- man asserts that Carlyle has nothing to do with Bioport. There were other ways that Carlyle was capitalizing on both the airplane attacks and the anthrax letters: security. Deep in the belly of a mountain in Boyers, Pe nnsylvania, exists an underground facility carved into rock that holds one of Carlyle's most important investments, U.S. Invest igations Services. USIS, as it is known, is a classic example of privatization, and a classic Carlyle investment. Once known as the U.S. Civil Se rvice Commission, then the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and finally the Office of Federal Investigations (OFI), the organization was a staple of the U.S. government's ability to gather"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"9/11/01 151 information on any individual ap plying for a job with the gov- ernment. Its charter, as it had been from the beginning, was to investigate the backgrounds of government employees, and provide them with varying levels of national security clearance. USIS's cave-like work environment is so mething that only James Bond could love. Rock walls, tight secu rity, no open-toed shoes, and no open flames—employees have steam ed lunches brought into the facility every day. The former mine is also home to the personnel files of thousands of go vernment officials. It is top secret stuff. The company's history, like most of the companies in Carlyle Partners II, is highly controversial. Since going private in 1996, USIS has been incredibly successful. But getting private wasn't so easy. Employees of the government-run Office of Federal Investigations fought the priva tization the whole way, fearing layoffs and salary cuts. They hired lawyers, testified at congres- sional hearings, and protested the decision to take it private, which was made by the Clinton ad ministration. To quiet them down, the government offered th e investigators an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) an d promised them the same or better salaries in the newly formed private enterprise. After years of acrimonious battles, the Office of Federal Investigations became USIS in July 1996. Employees retired from OFI and started work the next day at USIS. As life under the ESOP went on , some employees felt they had been duped. One former USIS employee says that USIS ex- ecutives harassed older investigators, encouraging them to leave the company so they could hire younger employees, who wouldn't vest in the stock plan for fi ve years. That left more of the equity pie to the high-level executives, should the company ever go public or sell itself. Before USIS had gone private though, the only investigators allowed to work on national security investigations had to have five years experience. That meant that the company would have to rely on less experienced"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"152 THE IRON TRIANGLE investigators for some of the most important jobs in the country. Many of the older investigators then left in disgust. The result was a watering down of the talent at USIS, and many blamed Carlyle for the changes. The company was growin g profits and acquiring smaller firms by the turn of the century. But nothing would compare to the explosion of business after September 11. \"Sin ce 9/11, USIS's acquisition of contracts has exploded,\" said one employee that declined to be identified. \"All the new FAA, Department of Transportation, Transportation Security Administration, INS, Customs, ... all of those employees being hired are being investigated by USIS. They also have contracts with all the major airlines, a nd the contract companies who provide airport security. I do not exaggerate when I say that Carlyle is taking over th e world in government contract work, particularly defense work. Carlyle is a one-world shadow government.\" USIS is just one more example of how Carlyle was in a fright- eningly good position to reap the benefits of September 11. There are more exampl es, like EG&G, a comp any Carlyle bought in the summer of 1999, which makes, among other things, the X-ray scanners that are used in airports. Whether the company is a \"shadow government,\" is for conspiracy theorists to debate. But the company's uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time sure doesn't help to dissuade the cynics. Crusader Denouement By 2002, Carlyle's decade of cu ltivating ties with prominent politicians and acquiring countless defense contractors was really paying off. President Bush was creating an Office of Homeland Security, and Secretar y of Defense Rumsfeld was talking of the war on terrorism being a long, drawn out affair, perhaps something that never ends. Defe nse budgets were soaring and"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Carlyle was already looking to ta ke other defense-related busi- nesses public in the coining year. After the unrelenting bad pres s about the Crusader approval reached a fever pitch in Washingt on, Rumsfeld, at the behest of Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, finally gave the order to kill the gun once and for all, but only after United De- fense had already made gobs of money from its public offering. It also came after Rumsfeld was publicly embarrassed by an Army- sponsored lobbying campaign of C ongress that went on behind Rumsfeld's back, after the Defense Secretary had already made it clear the program was to be cance lled. The actions on the part of the Army would result in Rumsfeld launching an investigation (still ongoing) and excoriating those re sponsible for the clandestine lobbying effort. \"I have a minimum of high regard for that kind of behavior,\" Rumsfeld would tell the press in an article by the Associated Press. But Carlyle had already taken its prof its. And besides, the very same day the U.S. Army officially notified United Defense of the termination of the Crusader cont ract, that same Army awarded United Defense a brand new contract for a new artillery system, much like the Crusader only much, much lighter. \"United Defense and its industry pa rtners welcome the new contract and the challenge of bringing the technological advances matured in the Crusader program to the Objective Force and the Future Combat System,\" said Keith Ho we, vice president and general manager of United Defense's Armament Systems Division, in the same press release that announced the end of the Crusader contract. \"The contract recognizes the tremendous capab ility and the performance of the over 2,200 employees nationwide that brought Crusader to the Army's Provi ng Ground and who will now focus their energies and talents on the need to field a less than 20-ton system to the Army by 2008.\" Everyone was happy with the resu lt.

The Army was assured of getting an even better gun in the same time frame as the Crusader had been promised. And United Defense got to prop up its stock price by announcing the new contract the day they announced the death of the old contract, without ever skipping a beat. It was classic Carlyle. United Defense also picked up in September 2002, a contract to pr ovide Taiwan with $250 million worth of amphibious assault vehicles. The deal happened after Carlucci, who is the chairman of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, met with Tang Yao-Ming, the defens e minister in Taiwan. Just another day in Carlyl e's global playground. The saga of Crusader is one of the clearest examples of how Carlyle does business. To th e outside observer, the company lives on the edge, deftly maneuvering its wa y through the revolving door of politics and business. Keenly aware of public opinion, and how to manage the press, Carlyle has always been able to avoid the kind of scandal that brings a comp any down. \"No one has any proof because there is no proof,\" explai ns Chris Ullman, the company's spokesperson. Though more financial companie s are learning from Carlyle's example—hiring politicians like Al Gore or Rudolph Giuliani, during their political downtime —we may never se e another com- pany like Carlyle. The sh eer volume of politica l capital the company has amassed in its 15 years of existence is unprecedented, and would be nearly impossible to duplicate. With $13 billion under manageme nt, close to 500 employees throughout the world, and hundreds of defense, aerospace, telecom and health care companies in their portfolio, it is safe to say that Carlyle has already gone well beyond Eisenhower's vision of a military industrial complex. There is every indication that with the current administration, and wa r remaining on the foreseeable horizon, Carlyle's power and reach may exceed anything Eisenhower might have imagined wh en he first warned against the formation of an Iron Triangle."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"9/11/01 155 The important thing to re member is that the story of Carlyle, while it makes good reading, is still youn g. The amount of influence the company wields is alre ady disconcerting, but at only 15 years old, the company is in a relative infa ncy. The potential of the company should not be underes timated, and a healthy dose of paranoia is probably in order when viewing an y of the Carlyle Group's actions. As America's most revered companies are brought down through scandals and abuses of the public's trust, it has never been more important for the average citizen to remain vigilant and skeptical, of our country's business and political leaders, even during war time, when we are expected to be exceedingly patriotic. While the Carlyle Group is certainly not about patriotism, it is a uniquely American story. It is about money, power, war, and politics. All of the things that build America's mi ght, and compromi se its integrity."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE It may well be that writing a book about the Carlyle Group in 2003 is a premature exercise. The company is, after all, only 15 years old, and is just now hi tting its stride. In fact, the future holds even more intrigue for this private equity behemoth than the past. In the summer of 2002, Carlyle helped form the China Venture Capital Association, a nebulous or ganization charged with warding off corruption in China and strengthening ties with the Chinese government. Chang Sun, the chairman of the group, said \"within the industry we need to have a mi nimal level of code of conduct so that we don't have people who ruin the reputation of the industry. We will talk about how to regula te ourselves rather than be regulated by the government.\" A truly scary prospect, but nothing we haven't seen before. China, like Saudi Arabia decades ago, is fertil e ground for American investment. Edging its way toward a more capitalistic society, China is still a massive unta pped market contro lled largely by the government: a combination tailor ma de for Carlyle's special brand of access capitalism. In othe r words, watch this space. Another area to keep an eye on would be Europe. In the fall of 2002, Carlyle completed an acquisition of Qinetiq, the research and development arm of the Unit ed Kingdom's Ministry of"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Epilogue 157 Defense. When news of the acquisition broke in England, the MOD came under fire for potentially compromising the national security of the United Kingdom by selling such a crucial unit to an American company run by so many ex-politicians. Fiona Draper, a representative of the trade un ion Prospect, which includes the scientists at Qinetiq, told reporters, \"the fact that they are a foreign company will obviously exacerbate my members concerns, given Carlyle's fairly opaque structure, there must be concerns over whether undue influence may be br ought to bear which may not be in Britain's interest.\" The \"opaque structure\" to which Draper refers is not uncommon for private companies, especially private equity companies. The nature of the business is such that a private company buys other private companies, none of whic h are obligated to reveal their financial records. All of which makes gathering information on Carlyle very challenging. Though it excels in buying and se lling businesses that are under heavy government regulation, Carlyle itself is under almost no scrutiny from federal overseers. The only thing keeping Carlyle the least bi t honest at this point is public interest groups and the media. And at a time when American patriotism is at an all-time high following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, cr iticizing the cu rrent president and his father for questionable business practices is a tricky business. There is frighteningly li ttle tolerance for muckraking at the moment. When Carlyle was notified of th is book, the comp any immediately circled its wagons, declining to allow any interviews of its employees and waging what one insider termed as a \"scorched earth campaign,\" instructing anyo ne that could be used as a source to clam up. Several people who have spoken to the partners about this book said the company is \"scared to death\" of the publicity that is sure to follow. It is common for former employees of the company to fear that Carlyle will somehow discern th eir identities if they speak"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"158 EPILOGUE to reporters, either on or off th e record, and ruin them. The com- pany has required many of its ex -employees to si gn nondisclosure agreements, or gag orders, instruct ing them not to talk about their work to the press, a highly unusual move. The result of the company essentially pleading the fifth is that they maintain plausible deniability of anything written abou t them. But the un intended effect is that it makes them a ppear as if they have something damaging to hide. All the while, Carlyle executives take umbrage at the mere suggestion that the company is secr etive. Yet the names of some of their most prominent employees, like George H. W. Bush, is not listed anywhere on the company's Web si te. There are many things this company doesn't want anyone to know. Conspiracy theorists that obsess on secret societies and outlandish plots overlook the more insidious and destructive effects of a company like Carlyle. By insinuating itself into the very fabric of the world's economic structure, Carlyle has accomplished far more than any Trilateral Commission or Masonic society could dream. They have made themselves an indispensable part of the international community's cash flow. Millions of people are invested in Carlyle and don't even know it, like the 1.3 million people relying on CalPERS to manage their pension fund. Do they even know that CalPERS is a part owner of Carlyle? Ultimately, the success of th e Carlyle Group depends on its continuing ability to ga in access to high-level government officials, thereby getting a jump on polic y changes, both domestic and international. And that access hinges on Carlyle's remarkable track record of hiring the most pow erful men in the world. To keep their stockpile of political powerhous es fresh, don't be surprised to see the company reach deep into the current Bush administration after the president leaves office and snare anyone from Colin Powell to Dick Cheney to Donald Rumsfeld to George W.

And as of June 2002, the company had over $13.5 billion under management in 21 different funds. Following is a sma ll sampling of the hundreds of companies that have been a part of the Carlyle family since the firm's founding in 1987. From the list, which is merely the tip of the iceberg, it is clear how thoroughly Carlyle has insinuated itself into the political, militar y, and financial fa bric of the Unit ed States. From security to weapons to information technology, Carlyle has all of the bases covered. United Defense was born from a partnership between Harsco and FMC, or Food Machinery Corp., when the two combined their defense units in 1994. The compa ny made a name for itself by producing the Bradley Fighting Vehicles, whic h was used to great effect during Desert Storm. Th e company was bought by Carlyle in 1997, in the midst of a major political battle over the future of its next-generation fighting vehi cle, a massive mobile howitzer called Crusader. After a contentious battle to save the gun program, despite widespread opposition, the Crusader program was cancelled in the summer of 2002, after United Defense had gone public in December 2001.

U.S. Invest igations Services is a private company, headquartered in an un derground bunker facility in western Pennsylvania, that pe rforms background checks on vir- tually all government employees, airline em ployees, and preem- ployment checks for corporate hires. The company has more than 3,600 employees, most of which ar e investigators, and operates in 178 locations throughout the United States. It performs more than one million cases a year for the federal government. Carlyle invested in USIS as a stra tegic partner in October 1999. Vinnell is one of the oldest comp anies to make an appearance in Carlyle's portfolio. Vinnell ha s a long, but mysterious past. Originally a heavy construction company that built airstrips in Vietnam, Vinnell burst onto the fo refront of the public's con- sciousness when in 1975 the comp any signed a multimillion dollar contract with the Saudi Arabian royal family, agreeing to train the Saudi National Guard, a privat e army charged with protecting the Saudi monarchy. The company pioneered a wave of military privatization, leading the way for dozens of similar mercenary outfits. The company claims to have operated on behalf of the U.S. government in more than 50 countries on five continents. But recent revelations have indicated th at the company, at least at one time, served as a cover for CIA activity in the Middle East. Vinnell was bought by RDM, a Carlyle company, in 1992. It was then purchased by TRW in 1997. BDM is historically one of the mo st successful defense consultants in history. Thanks to its er stwhile CEO Earl e Williams, the company became a player in the defense contracting business in Washington during the 1980s, and was bought by the Carlyle Group in 1990 from Loral, which had acquired the company"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Appendix A from Ford Aerospace. After a ro cky past, BDM settled in under Carlyle, doing more business in the burgeoning Saudi Arabian market. BDM was among the few co mpanies that stayed on in Saudi Arabia during th e Gulf War, a fact that was not lost on the royal family, or Saudi citizens, wh o bombed the offi ce buildings of BDM in 1994. Composite Structures is a make r of composite and metal-bond structures. Its products can be found on everything from fighter jets to Apache helicopters to missiles. The company does about $60 million in annual sales and employs 3 50 people. Among the military aircraft products that Co mposite manufactures are: AH-64 Apache Helicopter; C-17 Military Transport Jet; and the Bell UH-1 Military Helicopter Series. The Carlyle Group is a part owner of Composite Structures, which it purchased from Alcoa in the late 1990s. EG&G is named after its 1931 co-founding triumvirate, Harold Edgerton, Kenneth Germeshausen, and Herbert Grier. EG&G has been involved in everything from the Manhattan Project to modern day weapons design and analysis. Among the company's clients are the Departments of Energy, Defense, Treasury, and Transportation. It's annual sales are estimated at $500 million, and it employs more than 4,500 peopl e. Carlyle bought the company outright in August 1999. Federal Data Corporation is the premier provider of information technology services to the U. S. government. Federal Data Corporation boasts contracts with everyone from the Air Force to the Internal Revenue Service, and lots in between. Its annual revenues exceed $500 million, a nd it has more that 1,400 em- ployees. Carlyle bought the company in 1995 fo r under $100 million, and grew its revenues in 5 ye ars from $140 million to $538 m illion, then sold the company to Nort hrop Grumman in 2000 for $302 million."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"164 APPENDIX A Lier Siegler Services Inc.

Harry S. Tnnnan Building Washingt on, »C 20520 Dear Si We congratulate you on your great start as Secretary of State, We recognize &aj there is no shortage of serious issue* seeking your attentioa, but one of Ac earliest win cemiftly be Montenegro *s relationship to Serbia, As you know, Montenegro is the last of tee five original noo- Serbian republics to press its claim for independence. President Djukanovic WAS in Washington recently, and I hosted a long and spirited talk for several of us with Djukanovic to discuss hU thinking. Djukanovic is, of course, a proven friend, and ally of the United States, whose supportive rote during the NATO bombing campaign helped diminish the threat to Ame rican and allkd airmen. He abo took great risks to oppose Milosevic and aid the Serbian democrats during their darkest hours. He protected Mr. Djicdjic and many other Serbian democrats during the Kosovo war, and since 1998 has sheltered high rates of Kosovo refugees of all ethnic groups He has been die engine of pro-Western change in this heretofore-sol«% pro-Milosevic society, though he understands feat Montenegro has further to go to achieve full dfimGcratizatjKm and economic reform. Montenegro will for some lime remain a divided society whether or not it obtains independ ence, smce Montenegrins who allied themselves with Milosevic continue to side with Belgrade on retaining the FRY. Djukanovic struck us as determined to proceed to independence. He plans to hold special parliamentary elections April 22, which - if the pro- independence parties gain a majority - he intends to follow up with a. referendum on independen ce 45-to~60 days later, tf be ob tains over 50 percent of the vote ia !he referendum, h« plans to decent independence nr>d flw» begin a serious negotiation with Serbia about the future nature of their relations. He said that he views independence as a means to acMcvft tull democracy, market efficiency, and integration with Europe. By tak ing over the runctiorts of security, foreign affairs, trade, customs, currenc y, and economic management during Montenegro's (entire as the k ey U.S. ally ia the region, Djukanovic maintains the country has already acquired de facto independence. Djukanovic stressed that he pUn&cd to achi eve independence democratically and non-vioi erttly without destabilizing the region. He expressed confidence thai all Montenegrins, despite their political differences, would respect the majority decision in a referendum. He said he understood that die real issue behind the coolness, of Waslungton and the Europeans toward Montenegrin independence was not Montenegro itself but d ie impact of independence on Kosovo. Djukanovic said the Kosovo problem had originated long ago and escalated after Milosevic had revoked Kosovo's constitutional au tonomy. Then came the massive Serbian military intervention aod NATO's war. Meanwhile, Montenegro hid maintained good relations with the Alb anians, and Djukanovic had established a multiethnic state and cooperated with ethnic Albanian political parties in Montenegro, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE REVIEW AUTHORITY: JDONALD A.

A solution could only come through the efforts of Belgrade and Pristina with (he help of the internati onal community. He underlined that Montenegro was irrelevant to this process and that the success of Montenegro's multiethnic governance and reforms would have a stabilizing impact os both Serbia and Albanian communities in the region, In Ws view, Belgrade was just trying to frighten the international community by raising the problems of Kosovo, Macedonia, Gree ce, and the independence of Bosnia's Republika Srpska. The Bosnia problem, he said, was \"nonsense,\" stressing that Republika Srpska was a problem because of Serb nationalism in Belgrade. \"Belgrade tries to scare the international community that Montenegro's independence will cause Republika Srpska's secession, while all the time Belgrade is supporting Republika Srpska,\" he noted. He drew our attention to Belgrade media reporting that the U.S. by refusing to receive him at your level had rejected Montenegr o's independence effort. Despite this, the Serbs were still generally anti-American, while the Montenegrms were pro-American. Serbi a had refused to cooperate with the Hague tribunal, while Djukanovic indicated that he would arrest indictees residing in Montene gro if the chief prosecutor handed him any sealed indictment!. Asked whether be thought that maintaining the FRY would promote stability or instability, be said there was no question that it would be destabilizing: \"So long as Yugoslavia exists, Serbian nationalism lives on, Tbe concept of Greater Serbia is not gone,\" He said much of Europe was unhelpfully inclined toward the status quo. Despite the fact that Montenegro had met the terms of th e European Union's own Badinter Commission on independence for the Yugoslav republics, most Europeans had gone back on these principles, especially me two nations most friendly to Belgrade, France and Italy. These legal and performance principles were the same ones by which the EU and U.S. had recognized Slovenia's independence, which is now favored by many for NATO rrKmbership.
