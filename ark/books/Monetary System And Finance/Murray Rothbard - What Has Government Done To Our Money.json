Indeed, increasing th e stock of money through a central bank l i k e the Fed has horri fi c consequences, and Pr ofessor Rothbard provides the clearest explanation availabl e of in f l at ion .

A successful money needs only a fixed defi ni ti on rooted i n the commodi ty most suited to a monetary use, and a le gal system that enforces contracts and punishes theft and fraud. In a free market, the result has been, and would be, a gold standard. In such a free-market system, money wo uld be convertible domestically and internationally. Demand de posits would have 100% re serves, while the reserve rati os for ti me deposi ts wo uld be subject to the economic prudence of bankers and the watchful eye of the consuming public.

Wrangl es abound over \"ti g ht money\" vs. \"e asy money,\" over the roles of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury, over vari ous versions of the gold standard, etc. Should the government pump money into the economy or siphon it out? Which bran ch of t h e gov e rn men t ? Sh ou ld it en cou r age credit or rest rain it ? Sh ou ld it ret u rn to the gold standard? If so, at what rate? These and countless other questions mu lt iply , seemin gly w i t h ou t en d. Perhaps the Babel of views on the money question stems from man's propen sit y t o be \" r ealist i c, \" i. e. , t o st u d y on ly immediat e polit ical an d econ omic problems. If w e immerse ou rselv e s w h olly in day - t o- day af f a irs, w e cease mak i n g fundamental di sti n cti o ns, or aski ng the rea lly basic questions. Soon, basic issues are forgotten, and ai ml ess dri f t i s substi tuted for fi rm adherence to pri n ci pl e. Often we need to gain perspective, to stand asid e from our everyday affai r s i n order to u n d erst an d t h em more f u lly .

Analysis of C r u s oe an d F r iday on a desert islan d , mu ch abu s ed by crit ics as irrelev a n t t o today's world, actually performed the very useful functi on of spotl i g hti n g the basi c axioms of human action. Of all t h e econ omic problems, mon e y is possibly t h e most t a n g led, an d perhaps where we most need perspective. Money, moreover, is the economic area most encrusted and entangled with cent uries of government meddling. Many people—many economists—usually devoted to the free market stop short at money. Money, they i n si st, i s di fferent; i t must be supplied by government and regulated by government. They never thi n k of state cont rol of money as interference in the free market; a free market i n money i s unthi nkabl e to them. Governments must mi nt coins, issue paper, define \"l egal tender,\" create centra l banks, pump money in and ou t , \" s t a biliz e t h e price lev e l, \" et c. Hist orically , mon e y w a s on e of t h e f i rst t h in gs con t rolled by gov e rn men t , an d the free market \"revolution\" of the eighteenth and ninet eenth centuries made very l i ttl e dent i n the monetary sphere. So i t i s hi gh ti me that we turn fundamental attenti o n to the l i f e-bl ood of our economy—money. Let us fi rst ask oursel ves the questi on: Can money be organi zed under the freedom pri n ci pl e? Can we have a free mark et in mon e y as w e ll as in ot h e r goods and services? What would be the shape of such a market? And what are the effects of various governmental contro l s ?

Clearl y, Robi nson Crusoe had no need for money. He coul d not have eaten gol d coi n s. Nei t her woul d Crusoe and Fri d ay, perhaps exchangi ng fi sh for l u mber, need to both er about money. But when society expands bey o n d a f e w f a milies, t h e st age is already set f o r t h e emergen c e of mon e y . To expl ai n the rol e of money, we must go even further back, and ask: why do men ex ch an ge at all? E x ch an ge is t h e prime basis of ou r econ omic lif e. Wit h ou t exchanges, there would be no real economy and, practica lly, no society. Clearly, a voluntary exchange occurs because both partie s expect to benefi t. An exchange i s an agreement between A and B to transfer th e goods or services of one man for the goods and services of the other. Obviously, both benefit because each values what he recei v es i n exchange more than what he gi ves up. When Cr usoe, say, exchanges some fi sh for l u mber, he val u es the l u mber he \"buys\" more than the fi sh he \"sel l s ,\" w h ile F r iday , on t h e con t rary , v a lu es t h e f i sh more than the l u mber. From Ari s totl e to M a rx , men h a v e mist ak en ly [ 15] believ e d t h at an exchange records some sort of equ a lit y of v a lu e—t h at if on e barrel of f i sh is ex ch an ged f o r t e n logs, t h ere is some sort of u n d erly in g equality between them. Actual l y , th e exchange was made only because each party valued the two products in different order. Why should exchange be so univers al among mankind? Fundamentally, because of the great variety i n nature: the vari ety i n man, and the di versi t y of locat i on of n a t u ral resou r ces. E v ery man h a s a dif f e ren t set of sk ills an d apt i t u des, and every pl ot of ground has i t s own uni qu e features, its own distinctive resources. From thi s external natural fact of vari ety come exchanges; wheat i n Kansas for i r on in M i n n e sot a ; on e man ' s medical serv ices f o r an ot h e r' s play in g of t h e v i olin . Specializ at ion permit s each man t o dev e lop h i s best sk ill, an d allow s each region t o develop its own particular resources. If no one could exchange, if every man were forced to be compl e tel y sel f -suffi ci ent, i t is obvious that most of us would starve to deat h , an d t h e rest w o u l d barely remain aliv e.

How can he break up the plow and give part of it to a farmer and another part to a tailor?

An d t h in k of t h e pligh t of an economics teacher who has to find an e gg¦producer who wants to purchase a few econ omics lesson s in ret u rn f o r h i s eggs! C l early , an y sort of civ iliz ed econ omy is impossible under direct exchange. II. Money in a Free Society 3. Indirect Exchange But man discovered, in the process of tr ial and error, the route that permits a greatl y-expandi ng economy: indirect exchange. Under indire ct exchange, you sell your product not for a good whi c h you need directly, but for another good which you then, i n turn, sel l for the good you want. At first glance, this seems like a clumsy and rou n d - a bou t operat ion . Bu t it is act u ally t h e marv elou s in st ru men t t h at permit s civ iliz at ion t o dev e lop. Consider the case of A , the farmer, who wants to buy the shoes made by B . Since B doesn't want hi s eggs, he fi nds what B does want—let's say butter. A then exchanges his eggs for C's bu tter, and sel l s the butter to B for shoes. He fi rst buys t h e bu t t e r n o : becau s e h e w a n t s it direct ly , bu t becau s e it w ill permit h i m t o get h i s sh oes. Similarly , Smit h , a plow - o w n er, w ill sell h i s plow f o r on e commodit y w h ich h e can more readily div i de an d sell—say , bu t t e r—an d w ill t h en ex ch an ge [ 17] part s of the butter for eggs, bread, clothes, etc. In both cases, the superi ori t y of butter—the reason t h ere is ex t r a deman d f o r it bey o n d simple con s u m pt ion — is it s great e r marketability . If on e good is more mark et able t h an an ot h e r—if ev ery o n e is con f iden t t h at it w ill be more readily sold—t h e n it w ill come in t o great e r deman d becau s e it w ill be used as a me dium of e x change . It w ill be t h e mediu m t h rou g h w h ich on e specialist can exchange his product for the goods of other specialists. N o w ju st as in n a t u re t h ere is a great v a riet y of sk ills an d resou r ces, so t h ere is a v a riet y in t h e mark et abilit y of goods. Some goods are more w i dely deman d ed than others, some are more div i sible in t o smaller u n i t s without loss of value, some more durable over long periods of time , some more transportable over large dist an ces. All of t h ese adv a n t ages mak e f o r great e r mark et abilit y . It is clear t h at in ev ery societ y , t h e most mark et able goods w ill be gradu a lly select ed as t h e media f o r exchange. As they are more and more se l e cted as medi a, the demand for them increases because of this use, and so they become even more marke t able . The result is a rein f o rcin g spiral: more mark et abilit y cau s es w i der u s e as a mediu m w h ich cau s es more mark et abilit y , et c. E v en t u ally , on e or t w o commodit i es are u s ed as general me dia —in almost all exchanges—and these are called money. Hi stori c al l y , many di fferent goods have been used as medi a: tobacco i n colon i al Virgin ia, su gar in t h e West In dies, salt in Abyssinia, ca ttle in ancient Greece, n a ils in Scot lan d , copper in an cien t E g y p t , an d grain , beads, t e a, cow r ie sh ells, an d fi shhooks. Through the centuri e s, two commodi ti es, gold and silver , have emerged as money in the free competition of [18] the market, and have displaced the other commodities. Both are uniquel y marketable, are in great demand as ornaments, and ex cel in t h e ot h e r n e cessary qu alit ies. In recen t t i mes, silv er, bein g relat i v e ly more abundant than gol d , has been found more usef u l f o r smaller ex ch an ges, w h ile gold is more useful for larger transactions. At any rate, the i m portant thi n g i s that whatever the reason, the free market has found gold and si l v er to be the most effi ci ent moneys. 12 !

But the onl y way thi s can happen i s by begi nni ng wi th a useful commodi ty under barter, and then adding demand for a medium for exchange to the previous demand for di rect use (e.g., for ornaments, i n the case of gold [1] ). Thus, government i s powe rl ess to create money for the economy; it can only be developed by the processes of the free market. A most i m portant truth about mone y now emerges from our discussion: money is a commodity. Learni ng this simple lesson is one of the world's most i m portant tasks. So often [19] have peop l e tal k ed about money as somethi n g much more or less t h an t h is. M o n e y is n o t an ab stract unit of account , divorceable from a con c ret e good; it is n o t a u s eless t o k e n on ly good f o r ex ch an gin g ; it is n o t a \" c laim on societ y \" ; it is n o t a gu aran t ee of a f i x e d price lev e l. It is simply a commodit y . It di ffers from other commodi ti es in bein g deman d ed main ly as a medium of exchange. Bu t aside f r om t h is, it is a commodit y —an d , lik e all commodit i es, it h a s an ex ist i n g stock, it faces demands by people to buy an d h o ld it , et c. L i k e all commodit i es, it s \"price\"—in terms of other g oods—i s determi n ed by the i n te raction of its total supply, or stock, and the total demand by people to buy and hold it. (People \"buy\" money by sellin g t h eir goods an d serv ices f o r it , ju st as t h ey \" s ell\" mon e y w h en t h ey bu y goods and services.) [1 ] On the ori g i n of money, cf.

(New Haven Yale University Press, 1951) , pp. 97- 123. II. Money in a Free Society 4. Benefits of Money The emergence of money was a great b oon to the human race. Wi thout money— wi thout a general medi um of exchange—there coul d be no real speci a l i z ati o n, no advancement of the economy above a bare , primit iv e lev e l. Wit h mon e y , t h e problems of in div i sibilit y an d \" c oin c iden ce of w a n t s\" t h at plagu e d t h e bart er societ y al l vani sh. Now, Jones can hi re l a borers and pay them i n ... money. Smi t h can sel l hi s pl ow i n exchange for uni ts of... money. Th e money-commodi ty i s di vi si bl e i n to smal l u n i t s , an d it is gen e rally accept able by all. An d so all goods an d serv ices are sold f o r money, and then money i s used to buy othe r goods and services that people desire. Because of money, an elaborate \"structure of production\" can be formed, wi th l a nd, labor serv ices, an d capit a l goods cooperat in g to advance production at each [20] stage and receiving payment in money. The establishment of money conveys another great benefi t. Si nce al l exchanges are made in money, all the exch ange-ratios are expressed in money, and so people can now compare the market wort h of each good to that of every other good. If a TV set exchanges for three ounc es of gold, and an automobile exchanges for sixty ounces of gold, then everyone can see that one automobi l e i s \"worth\" twenty TV sets on the mark et. These exchange-ratios are prices , and the money- commodit y serv es as a common den o min a t o r f o r all prices.

Only such calculations can allocate resources to their mo st producti ve uses— t o t h ose u s es t h at w ill most sat i sf y t h e deman d s of con s u m ers. Many textbooks say that money has several functi ons: a medi um of exchange, uni t of account, or \"measure of values,\" a \"sto re of value,\" etc. But it sh ou ld be clear t h at all of these functions are simply corollaries of the one great function: the medium of exchange. Because gold is a gen e ral mediu m , it is most marketable, it can be stored to serve as a medi um i n the future as wel l as the present, and all prices are [ 21] expressed in its terms. [2] Becau se gold is a commodity medium for all exchanges, it ca n serve as a uni t of account for present, and expected future, prices. It is import ant to real i z e that money cannot be an abstract unit of account or cl ai m, except i n sofar as i t serves as a medi um of exchange. [2 ] Money does not \"measure\" prices or values; it i s the common denomi nator for thei r expressi on. In short, prices are expressed in mone y; they are not measured by it. II. Money in a Free Society 5. The Monetary Unit Now that we have seen how money emerged, and what it does, we may ask: how is t h e mon e y - c ommodit y u s ed? Specif ically , w h at is t h e st ock , or su pply , of mon e y in society, and how is it exchanged? In the fi rst pl ace, most tangi b l e physi c al goods are traded i n terms of wei g ht. Weigh t is t h e dist in ct iv e u n i t of a t a n g ible commodit y , an d so t r adin g t a k e s place in terms of uni ts l i k e tons, pounds, ounces, grai ns, grams, etc. [3] Gold is n o ex cept ion . Gold, lik e ot h e r commodit i es, w ill be t r aded in u n i t s of w e igh t . [4] It is obvious that the size of the common uni t chosen i n tradi n g makes no difference to the economist. One country, on the metric system, may prefer to figure in grams; England or America may prefer to reckon i n grai ns or ounces. Al l uni ts of weight are convertible into each other; one pound equals sixteen ounces; one ounce equals 437.5 grains or 28.35 grams, etc. [22] Assumi ng gol d i s chosen as the money, the si ze of the gold —uni t used i n reck on in g is immat e rial t o u s . J o n e s may sell a coat f o r on e gold ou n c e in America, or f o r 28. 35 grams in F r an ce; bot h prices are iden t i cal. All t h is migh t seem lik e laborin g t h e ob vious, except that a great deal of misery in t h e w o rld w o u l d h a v e been av oided if people h a d f u lly realiz ed t h ese simple truths. Nearly everyone, for example, th i n ks of money as abstract uni ts for somethi n g or other, each cl eavi ng uni quely to a certain country. E v en when countries were on the \"gold standard,\" pe ople t h ou gh t in similar t e rms. American money was \"dollars,\" French was \"francs, \" German \"marks,\" etc. All these were admi ttedl y ti ed to gol d , but al l were co nsidered sovereign and independent, and hence i t was easy for countri es to \"go off the gol d standard.\" Yet all of these names were simply names for units of weight of gold or silver. 14 !

Money in a Free Society 6. The Shape of Money If the si ze or the name of the money-uni t makes l i ttl e economi c di fference; nei t her does the shape of the monetary metal.

[6] Gold has been traded as money i n the raw form of nuggets , as gold dust in sacks, and even as jewelry. It should not be surprising that gol d , or other moneys, can be traded i n many forms, since their import ant feature is their weight. It i s true, however, that some shapes are often more conveni e nt than others. In recent centuries, gold and silv er have been broken down into coins , for smaller, day-to-day transactions, and into larger ba rs for bigger transactions. Other gold is transformed into jewelry and other ornaments. Now, any kind of transformation from on e sh ape t o an ot h e r cost s t i me, ef f o rt , an d ot h e r resou r ces.

Money in a Free Society 7. Private Coinage The idea of private coinage seems so st ran g e t o day t h at it is w o rt h ex amin in g careful l y . We are used to thi n ki ng of coi n age as a \"necessity of sovereignty.\" Yet, after all, we are not wedded to a \"royal pr erogative,\" and it is the American concept that sovereignty rests, not in government, but in the people. How woul d pri v ate coi n age work? In th e same way, we have sai d , as any other busi ness. Each mi nter woul d produce wh atever size or shape of coin is most pleasing to his customers. The price would be set by the free competition of the market. The standard objection is that it would be too much trouble to weigh or assay bits of gold at every transaction. But what is there to prevent private minters from stampi ng the coi n and guaranteei ng i t s wei g ht and fi neness? Pri v ate mi nters can guarantee a coin at least as well as a go vernment mint. Unbrai ded bits of metal would not be accepted as co in . P e ople w o u l d u s e t h e coin s of those mi nters wi th the best reputation for good quality of product. We have seen that thi s i s preci s el y how t h e \" d ollar\" became promin en t — as a compet it iv e silv er coin . Opponents of private coinage charge that fraud would run rampant. Yet, these same opponents woul d trust govern ment to provide the coinage. But if gov e rn men t is t o be t r u s t e d at all, t h en su rely , w i t h priv at e coin age, gov e rn men t coul d at l e ast be trusted to prevent or puni sh fraud. It i s usual l y assumed that the preventi on or puni shment of fraud, theft, or ot h e r crimes is t h e real ju st if icat ion f o r government. [26] But i f government canno t apprehend the criminal when private coin age is relied u p on , w h at h o pe is t h ere f o r a reliable coin age w h en t h e in t e grit y of the private market place operators is disca rded in favor of a government monopoly of coin age?

The modern market economy contai ns an i n fi ni te number of i n tri c ate exchanges, most depending on definite standards of quan ti ty and qual i t y. But fraud is at a minimum, and that minimum, at least in theory, may be persecuted. So it would be if there were private coinage. We can be sure that a minter's customers, and his competitors, would be keenly [27] al ert to any possible fraud in the weight or fineness of his coins. [7] Champions of the government's coinag e monopoly have claimed that money i s di fferent from al l other commodi ti es, be cause \"Gresham's Law\" proves that \"bad money drives out good\" from circulation.

After a few years of wear and tear, let us say that some coins weigh only .9 ounces. Obviously, on the free market, the worn coins would circulate at only ni nety percent of the val u e of the ful l - bo died coins, and the nominal face-value of the former would have to be repudiated.

What has th e government really done? It has imposed price control by coercion on the \"exchange rate \" between the two types of coi n . By i n si sti n g on the par-rati o when the worn coins should exchange at ten percent discount [28], it artificially overvalues the worn coins and undervalues new coins.

The \"Proper\" Supply of Money Now we may ask: what i s the suppl y of money i n soci ety and how i s that suppl y used? In particular, we may raise the pe renni al questi on, how much money \"do we need\"? Must the money supply be regulated by some sort of \"criteri on,\" or can it be left alone to the free market? [29] Fi rst, the total stock, or supply, of money in society at any one time, is the total weight of the existing money-stuff . Let us assume, for the ti me bei n g, that onl y one commodity is established on the free ma rket as money. Let us further assume that gold is t h at commodit y ( a lt h o u g h w e cou l d h a v e t a k e n silv er, or ev en iron ; it is up to the marke t , and not to us, to deci de the be st commodity to use as money). Sin c e mon e y is gold, t h e t o t a l su pply of mon e y is t h e t o t a l w e igh t of gold ex ist i n g in society. The shape of gold does not matter—except if the cost of changing shapes in cert ain w a y s is great e r t h an in ot h e rs ( e . g . , min t in g coin s cost in g more t h an melt in g t h em) .

In creases w ill st em f r om great e r produ c t i on f r om min e s; decreases from being used up in wear and t e ar, in in du st ry , et c. Because the market w ill ch oose a du rable commodit y as mon e y , an d becau s e mon e y is n o t u s ed u p at the rate of other commodi ti es—but i s em ployed as a medium of exchange—the proportion of new annual production to its total stock will tend to be quite small. C h an ges in t o t a l gold st ock , t h en , gen e rally t a k e place v e ry slow ly . What \"should\" the supply of money be? All sort s of crit eria h a v e been pu t forward: that money shoul d move i n accord ance wi th popul a ti on, wi th the \"vol ume of trade,\" with the \"amounts of goods produced ,\" so as to keep the \"pri ce l e vel \" constant, etc. Few indeed have suggested l e avi n g [30] the deci si on to the market. But money di ffers from other commodi ti es i n one essential fact. And grasping this di fference furni s hes a key to understandi ng monetary matters. When the suppl y of any other good increases, this increase co nfers a soci al benefi t; i t i s a matter for gen e ral rejoicin g. M o re con s u m er goods mean a h i gh er st an dard of liv in g f o r t h e public; more capital goods mean sustaine d an d in creased liv in g standards in the future. The di scovery of new, ferti l e l a nd or natural resources also promises to add to living standards, present and future. But what about money? Does an addi ti on to the money suppl y al so benefit the public at large? Consumer goods are used up by consumers; capi tal goods and natural resources are used up in the process of pr oduci n g consumer goods. But money i s not used up; i t s functi on i s to act as a medium of exchanges—to enable goods and services to travel more ex peditiously from one person to another. These exchanges 3% 3 are all made in t e rms of mon e y prices. T h u s , if a t e lev i sion set ex ch an ges f o r three gold ounces, we say that the \"price\" of the tel e vi si on set i s three ounces. At an y on e t i me, all goods in t h e econ omy w ill ex ch an ge at cert ain gold¦ r at ios or prices. As w e h a v e said, mon e y , or gold, is t h e common den o min a t o r of all prices.

But, in this case , the \"pri ce of money\" i s an array of the i n fi ni te number of exchange-ratios for all the various goods on the market. Thus, suppose that a televi sion set costs three gold ounces, an auto sixty ounces, a loaf of bread 1/100 of an ounce, and an hour of Mr. Jones' legal services on e ou n c e. [ 31] T h e \" p rice of mon e y \" w ill t h en be an array of alt e rn at iv e ex ch an ges.

The price of money, then, is the \"purchasing po wer\" of the monetary uni t—i n thi s case, of the gol d ounce. It tel l s what that o unce can purchase in exchange, just as the money-pri ce of a tel e vi si on set tel l s how much money a te levision set can bring in exchange. What determines the price of money? The same forces that determine all prices on the market—that venerable but et ernally true law: \"supply and demand.\" We all k n ow t h at if t h e su pply of eggs in creases, t h e price w ill t e n d t o f a ll; if t h e bu y e rs' deman d f o r eggs in creases, t h e price w ill t e n d t o rise.

Bu t w h at is t h e deman d f o r mon e y ? In t h e case of eggs, we know what \"demand\" mean s; i t i s the amount of money consumers are w illin g t o spen d on eggs, plu s eggs ret a in ed an d n o t sold by su ppliers. Similarly , in the case of money, \"demand\" means th e vari ous goods offered i n exchange for money, pl us the money retai n ed i n cash an d not spent over a certai n ti me peri od. In both cases, \"supply\" may refer to the total stock of the good on the market. What happens, then, if the supply of gold increases, demand for money remain in g t h e same?

An ou n c e of gold w ill n o w be w o rt h less t h an 100 loaves of bread, 1/3 of a television se t, etc. [32] Conversely, if the supply of gold falls, the purchasing power of the gold-ounce rises. What i s the effect of a change i n th e money supply? Following the example of David Hume, one of the first economists, we may ask oursel ves what woul d happen if, overnight, some good fairy slipped in to pockets, purses, and bank vaults, and doubled our supply of money. In our exam ple, she magically doubled our supply of gold. Would we be twice as ri ch? Obvi ousl y not.

Is hoardi ng real l y a menace? In the fi rst pl ace, what has si mpl y happened is an increased demand for money on the part of the miser. As a result , prices of goods fall, and the purchasing power of the gold-ounce rises. There has been no loss to society, which simply carri es on wi th a l o wer acti ve suppl y of more \"powerful \" gol d ounces. E v en in the worst possible view of the matter, then, nothi n g has gone wrong, and monetary freedom creates no di ffi cul t i e s. But there i s more to the probl e m than that. For i t i s by no means i rrati onal for peopl e to desi re more or less money in their cash balances. Let us, at thi s poi n t, study cash bal a nces further. Why do peopl e keep any cash balan c es at all? Su ppose t h at all of us were abl e to foretel l the future wi th absolute certainty.

We [37] have seen that the t o t a l su m of cash balan c es in societ y is equ a l an d iden t i cal w i t h t h e t o t a l su pply of money. Let us assume the supply rema ins constant, say at 3,000 tons. Now, suppose, for whatever reason—perhaps gr owing apprehension—people's demand for cash balances increases. Surely, it is a posi ti ve soci al benefi t to satisfy this demand. But how can i t be sati sfi e d when the to tal sum of cash must remain the same? Simply as f o llow s : w i t h people v a lu in g cash balan c es more h i gh ly , t h e deman d f o r money increases, and prices fall. As a resu lt, the same total sum of cash balances now confers a higher \"real\" balance, i.e., it is higher in proportion to the prices of goods—to the work that money has to perform. In short, the effective cash balances of t h e pu blic h a v e in creased. C o n v ersely , a f a ll in t h e deman d f o r cash w ill cau s e increased spending and higher prices. The public's desire for lower effective cash balan c es w ill be sat i sf ied by t h e n e cessit y f o r giv e n t o t a l cash t o perf orm more w o rk . Therefore, while a change in the price of money stemming from changes in supply merely alters the e ffectiveness of the money¦uni t and confers no social benefi t, a fal l or ri se caused by a change i n the demand for cash balances does yi el d a soci al benefi t—for i t satisfies a public desire for eith er a higher or lower proportion of cash bal a nces to the work done by cash. On the other hand, an increased supply of mon e y w ill frustrate public demand for a more effective sum total of cash (more effective in terms of purchasing power).

T h e resu lt in g f r ee econ omy w o u l d not be chaotic. On the contrary, the economy woul d move swi f tl y and effi ci entl y to supply the wants of consumers. The money market can al so be free. T h u s f a r, w e h a v e simplif ied t h e problem by assu min g on ly on e mon e t a ry metal—say, gold.

P o ssibly , gold w ill be t h e mon e y in on e area an d si l v er i n another, or el se they both may circulate side by side . Gold, for example, bei n g ounce-for-ounce more val u abl e on th e market than silver, may be used for larger t r an sact ion s an d silv er f o r smaller. Wou l d n o t t w o mon e y s be impossibly chaoti c?

It i s not necessary, however, for the government to step i n and save t h e mark et f r om it s ow n f o lly in main t a in in g t w o mon e y s .

Money Warehouses Suppose, then, that the free market has esta bl i s hed gol d as money (forgetti ng agai n abou t silv er f o r t h e sak e of simplicit y ) . E v en in t h e con v en ien t sh ape of coin s, gold is often cumbersome and awkward to carry an d use directly in exchange. For larger transacti o ns, i t i s awkward and expensi v e to transport several hundred pounds of gold. But the free market, ever ready to sa tisfy social needs, comes to the rescue. Gold, in the first place, must be stored so mew h ere, an d ju st as specializ at ion is most ef f i cien t in ot h e r lin es of bu sin e ss, so it w ill be most ef f i cien t in t h e w a reh o u s in g bu sin e ss. C e rt ain f i rms, t h en , w ill be su ccessf u l on t h e mark et in prov idin g w a reh o u s in g serv ices. Some w ill be gold w a reh o u s es, an d w ill st ore gold f o r it s myri ad owners. As i n the case of al l wa rehouses, the owner's ri ght to the stored goods is established by a warehouse receipt whi c h he recei v es i n [43] exchange for stori n g the goods. The recei p t enti tl es the owner to cl ai m hi s goods at any ti me he desires. t h is w a reh o u s e w ill earn prof it n o dif f e ren t ly f r om an y ot h e r—i. e. , by charging a price for its storage services. There is every reason to believe that gol d warehouses, or money warehouses, w ill f l ou rish on t h e f r ee mark et in t h e same w a y t h at ot h e r w a reh o u s es w ill prosper. In fact, warehousi n g pl ays an even more i m po rt an t role in t h e case of mon e y . F o r all other goods pass into consumption, and so must leave the warehouse after a while to be used up i n producti on or consumpti o n. But money, as we have seen, i s mai n l y n o t \" u sed\" in 3&3 t h e ph y s ical sen s e; in st ead, i t i s used to exchange for other goods, an d t o lie in w a it f o r su ch ex ch an ges in t h e future. In short, money is not so much \"used up\" as simply transferred from one person to another. In su ch a sit u at ion , con v en ien c e in ev it ably leads t o transfer of the warehouse receipt instead of the physical gold itself . Suppose, for example, that Smith and J o n e s bot h st ore t h eir gold in t h e same w a reh o u s e. J o n e s sells Smit h an au t o mobile for 100 gold ounces. They could go thro ugh the expensive process of Smith's redeeming his receipt, and movi ng thei r gol d to Jones' offi ce, wi th Jones turni n g ri ght arou n d an d redeposit i n g t h e gold again .

Rothbard convenient course: Smith si mply gives Jones a warehous e receipt for 100 ounces of gold. In thi s way, warehouse recei p ts for mo ney come more and more to functi on as money substitutes . Fewer and fewer transacti o ns mo ve the actual gol d ; i n more and more cases paper ti tl es to the gol d are used instead. As the market [44] dev e lops, t h ere w ill be t h ree limit s on t h e adv a n c e of t h is su bst i t u t i on process. One is the extent that people us these money warehouses—called banks —instead of cash. Cl earl y, i f Jones, for some reason, di dn't l i k e to use a bank, Smi t h woul d have to transport the actual gol d . The second limit is t h e ex t e n t of t h e clien t ele of each bank . In other words, the more transactio ns take place between clients of different banks, t h e more gold w ill h a v e t o be t r an sport e d. T h e more ex ch an ges are made by clien t s of the same bank, the l e ss need to tran sport the gold. If Jones and Smith were cl i e nts of di fferent warehouses, Smi t h's bank (or Smi t h hi msel f) woul d have to transport the gol d to Jones' bank.

In t h is respect , all w a reh o u s es—an d all bu sin e sses rest in g on good w ill—are alik e. As ban k s grow an d con f iden ce in t h em dev e lops, t h eir clien t s may f i n d it more convenient in many cases to waive their right to paper receipts—called bank notes— and, instead, to keep their titles as open book accounts . In the monetary real m, these have been called bank deposits . Instead of transferring paper receipts, the cl i e nt has a book cl ai m at the bank; he ma kes exchanges by writing an order to his warehouse to transfer a porti o n of thi s account to someone else. Thus, in our example, Smith will order the bank to transf er book title to his 100 gold ounces to J o n e s. T h is w r it t e n order is called a check . It sh ou ld be clear t h at , econ omically , there is no difference whatever between a bank not and a bank deposit. Both are clai ms to ownership of stored gold; both are transferred [45] similarly as money substi tutes, and both have the i d enti cal three limit s on t h eir ex t e n t of u s e. T h e clien t can ch oose, accordin g t o t h is con v en ien c e, whether he wishes to keep his ti tl e i n note, or deposi t, form. [14] Now, what has happened to thei r mone y supply as a result of all these operations? If paper notes or bank deposits are used as \"money substitutes,\" does thi s mean that the effecti v e money su pply in the economy has increased even though the stock of gold has remained the same? Certai nl y not. For the money substitutes are simply warehouse receipts f o r act u ally - d eposit ed gold. If J o n e s deposits 100 ounces of gold in his wareho use and gets a receipt for it, the receipt can be used on the market as money, but onl y as a conveni e nt stand-in for the gol d , not as an increment. The gold in the vault i s then no l o nger a part of the effecti v e money supply, but is held as a reserve for its receipt, to be claimed whenever desired by its owner. An increase or decrea se i n the use of substi tutes, then, exerts no change on the money supply. Only the form of the supply is changed, not the t o t a l. T h u s t h e mon e y su pply of a commu n i t y may begin as t e n million gold ou n c es. T h en , six million may be deposit e d in ban k s, in ret u rn f o r gold n o t e s, w h ereu pon t h e ef f e ct iv e su pply w ill n o w be: f o u r million ou n c es of gold, six million ou n c es of gold cl ai ms i n paper notes. The total money supply has remained the same. Curi ousl y, many peopl e have argued th at it would be impo ssible for banks to make money if they were to operate [46] on this \"100 percent reserve\" basis (gold al ways represented by i t s recei p t). Yet, ther e i s no real probl e m, any more than for any warehouse. Almost all warehouses k eep all the goods for their owners (100 percent reserve) as a matter of course—in fa ct, it would be considered fraud or theft to do otherwise. Their profits are earned from service charges to their customers. The banks can charge for their services in the same way.

We come now to perhaps the thorni est probl e m faci ng the monetary economist: an evaluation of \"fractional reserve banking. \" We must ask the question: would fractional reserve ba nking be permitted in a fr ee market, or would it be proscribed as fraud? It is well-known th at banks have rarely stayed on a \"100%\" basi s very l o ng. Si nce money can remai n i n the warehouse for a l o ng peri od of ti me, the bank i s tempted to use some of th e money for its own account—tempted also because people do not ordinarily care whet her the gold coins they receive back from the warehouse are the identical gold coins th ey deposited. The bank is tempted, then t o u s e ot h e r people' s mon e y t o earn a prof it f o r it self .

It cannot possibly hand over its customers' property, should they all so desire. [47] Generally, banks, instead of taking th e gold directly, print uncovered or \"pseudo\" warehouse recei p ts, i.e., warehouse receipts for gol d that i s not and cannot be there. These are then loan ed at a profit. C l early, the economi c effect i s the same. More warehouse receipts are printed than go ld ex it s in t h e v a u l t s . Wh at t h e ban k h a s don e is t o issu e gold w a reh o u s e receipt s which represent nothing, but are supposed to represent 100% of their face value in go ld. The pseudo-receipts pour forth on the trusti ng market i n the same way as the tr ue recei p ts, and thus add to the effecti v e money suppl y of the country. In the abov e example, if the banks now issue two million ou n c es of f a lse receipt s , w i t h n o gold beh i n d t h em, t h e mon e y su pply of t h e cou n t ry w ill rise f r om t e n t o t w elv e million gold ou n c es—at least u n t il t h e h o cu s- pocu s h a s been discov e red an d correct ed.

Issue of pseudo-receipts, like counter f e it in g of coin , is an ex ample of inflation , w h ich w ill be st u d ied f u rt h e r below . Inflation may be defined as any increase in the economy's supply of money not consisting of an increase in the stock of the money me tal . F r act i on al reserv e ban k s, t h eref ore, are in h e ren t ly in f l at ion a ry in st it u t ion s . Defenders of banks repl y as fol l o ws: the banks are si mpl y functi oni n g l i k e other businesses—they ta ke ri sks. Admi ttedl y, i f al l the deposi tors presented thei r claims, the banks would be ba nkrupt, si nce outstandi n g rece ipts exceed gold in the v a u l t s . Bu t , ban k s simply t a k e t h e ch an ce—u su ally ju st if ied—t h at n o t ev ery o n e w ill ask for hi s gol d . The [48] great di fference, however, between the \"fractional reserve\" bank and al l other busi ness i s thi s : othe r businessmen use their own or borrowed capit a l in v e n t u r es, an d if t h ey borrow cred i t , they promi s e to pay at a future date, taki ng care to have enough money at hand on that date to meet thei r obl i g ati o n. If Smith borrows 100 gold ounces for a year, he will arrange to have 100 gold ounces avai l a bl e on that future date. But the bank isn't borrowing from its depositors; it doesn't pledge to pay back gold at a certain date in the fu ture. Instead, it pledges to pay t h e receipt in gold at an y t i me, on dema nd. In short, the bank note or deposi t i s not an IOU, or debt; i t i s a warehouse re ceipt for other people's property. Further, when a businessman borrows or lends money, he does not add to the money supply. The loaned funds are saved funds, part of the existing money supply being transferred from saver to bo rrower.

T h e dire econ omic ef f e ct s of f r act i on al ban k mon e y w ill be ex plored in t h e next chapter. Here we concl u de that, mo ral l y , such banki n g woul d have no more ri ght to exi s t i n a trul y free market than any other form of i m pl i c i t theft. It i s true that the note or deposi t does not actua lly say on its face that the warehouse guarantees to keep a full back ing of gold on hand at all times. But the bank does promise to redeem on demand, and so when it issu es an y f a k e receipt s , it is already commi tti ng fraud, si nce i t i mmediately becomes impossible for the bank to keep its pledge and redeem all of its notes and deposits. [15] Fraud, therefore, is immediately bei n g commi tted when the act of i ssu ing pseudo-receipts takes place. Which particular receipts are fraudu lent can only be discovered after a run on the bank has occu rred ( s in ce all t h e receipt s look alik e) , an d t h e lat e ¦ c omin g claiman t s are lef t high and dry. [16] If fraud i s to be proscri b ed i n a free soci ety, then fracti onal [50] reserve banking would have to meet the same fate. [17] Suppose, however, that fraud and f r act i on al reserv e ban k in g are permit t e d, w i t h t h e ban k s on ly requ ired t o f u lf ill t h eir obligat ion s t o redeem in gold on deman d . An y f a ilu re t o do so w o u l d mean in st an t bankruptcy. Such a system has come to be known as \"free banking.\" Would there then be a heavy fraudul e nt i ssue of mone y substi tutes, wi th resul t i n g arti fi ci al creati on of new money? Many peopl e ha ve assumed so, and believed that \"wildcat ban k in g\" w o u l d t h en simply in f l at e t h e mon e y su pply ast r on omically . Bu t , on t h e contrary, \"free banki n g\" woul d l e ad to a fa r \"harder\" monetary system than we have today. The banks would be checked by the same three l i m i t s that we noted above, an d ch eck e d rat h er rigorou s ly . In t h e f i rst place, each ban k ' s ex pan s ion w ill be limit ed by a loss of gold t o an ot h e r ban k . F o r a ban k can on ly ex pan d mon e y w i t h in t h e limit s of it s own clientele. Suppose, for example, that Bank A , with 10,000 ounces of gold deposited, now issues 2000 ounces of false warehouse receipts to gol d , and l e nds them to vari ous enterpri se s, or invests them in securities. The borrow e r, or f o rmer h o lder of secu rit i es, w ill spen d t h e n e w mon e y on v a riou s goods an d serv ices. E v en t u ally , t h e mon e y goin g t h e rou n d s w ill reach an ow n e r w h o is a clien t of another bank, B . [51] At that poi n t, Bank B w ill call u p on Ban k A t o redeem it s receipt in gold, so that the gol d can be transferred to Bank B 's vaul ts. Cl earl y, th e wider the extent of each bank's clientele, and the more the cl i e nts trade wi th one another, the more scope there is for each bank to expand its credit and money supply. For if the bank's clien t ele is n a rrow , t h en soon af t e r it s issu e of creat e d mon e y , it w ill be called u p on to redeem—and, as we have seen, it does n't have the wherewithal to redeem more than a fraction of its obligations. To avoid th e threat of bankruptcy from thi s quarter, then, the narrower the scope of a bank's cl i e nt ele, the greater the fraction of gold it must keep in reserve, and the less it ca n expand. If there is one bank in each cou n t ry , t h ere w ill be f a r more scope f o r ex pan s ion t h an if t h ere is on e ban k f o r every two persons i n the communi ty. Other th ings being equal, then, the more banks there are, and the tinier thei r si ze, the \"harder\"—and better—the monetary suppl y w ill be.

None of this discussion is meant to impugn the general practice of credit , whi c h has an i m portant and vi tal functi on on the free market. In a credit transaction, the possessor of money (a good useful in the present) exchanges it for an IOU payable at some future date (the IOU bei n g a \"future good \") and the interest charge reflects the higher valuation of present g oods over future goods on the market. But bank notes or deposits are not credit; they are warehouse receipts, instantaneous claims to cash (e.g., gold) in the bank va ults. The debtor makes sure that he pays his debt when payment becomes due; the fracti onal reserve banker can never pay more t h an a small f r act i on of h i s ou t s t a n d in g liabilit ies. We turn, i n the next chapter, to a stud y of the various forms of governmental interference in the monetary system—m ost of them desi gned, not to repress fraudul e nt i ssue, but on the contrary, to remove these and other natural checks on in f l at ion . [ 14] A thir d f o r m o f mo ney - substitute will be to ken co ins for very smal l change. These are, i n effect, equivalent to bank notes, but \"printed\" on base metal rather than on paper.

[ 16] Perhaps a libertarian system would consider \"general warrant deposits \" (which allow the warehouse to r e tur n any ho mo geneo u s go o d to the depo sito r ) as \"specif i c war r a nt depo sits,\" which, lik e bills o f lading, pawn tickets, dock warrants, etc., establish ownership to certain specif i c earmarked objects. F o r, i n the case o f a general depo sit warrant, the wareho use is tempted to treat the go o d s as its own property, instead of being the property of its customers. This is precisely what the banks have been doing. See J e vons , op. c i t . , pp. 207- 12. [ 17] Fr aud is implicit theft, since it means that a co ntract has no t been co mpleted after the v a lue has been r e ceiv ed. In sho r t, if A sells B a bo x labeled \"co r n f l akes\" and i t turns out to be straw upon openi n g, A's fraud i s real l y theft of B's property. Si mi l a rl y, the i ssue of warehouse recei p ts for non-exi s tent goods, i d enti cal wi th genui ne recei p ts, i s fraud upon th ose who possess claims to non-existent property. II.

The uni t of money i s si mpl y a uni t of wei g ht of the monetary commodity—usually a metal, such as gold or silver.

III. Government Meddling With Money 1. The Revenue of Government Governments, in contrast to all other orga ni zati ons, do not obtai n thei r revenue as payment for their services. C o nsequently, governments face an economic problem di fferent from that of everyone el se. Pri v ate individuals who want to acquire more goods and services from others must prod uce and sel l more of what others want. Governments need onl y fi nd some method of expropriating more goods without the owner's consent. In a barter economy, government offi ci als can only expropriate resources in one way: by seizing goods in kind . In a mon e t a ry econ omy t h ey w ill f i n d it easier t o seize mone tary assets, and then use the money to acquire goods and services for government, or el se pay the money as subs idies t o f a v o red grou ps.

III. Government Meddling With Money 2. The Economic Effects of Inflation To gauge the economi c effects of i n fl ati o n, l e t us see what happens when a group of counterfeiters set about their wo rk.

In short, the counterfeiters and thei r local ret a ilers h a v e f o u n d t h eir in comes increased before any rise in the prices of the thi n gs they buy.

To businessmen, the new funds seem to be ge nui ne i n vestments, but these funds do not, like free market investments, arise fr om vol untary savi ngs.

In short, if people wish to save and invest about 20% of their incomes and consume the rest, new bank money l o aned to business at firs t makes the saving proportion look higher.

That was the indispensable means of getting control of the coinage supply. The king's or the lord's picture was stamped upon coins, and the myth was propagated th at coin age is an essen t ial prerogat iv e of royal or baronial \"sovereignty.\" The mi ntage monopoly allowed government to supply whatever denominations of coin it , an d n o t t h e pu blic, w a n t ed. As a resu lt , the variety of coins on the market was forc ibly reduced. Furthermore, the mint could now charge a high price, greater than cost s (\"seigniorage\"), a price just covering costs (\"brassage\"), or supply coins free of charge. Seigniorage was a monopoly price, an d it imposed a special bu rden on t h e con v ersion of bu llion t o coin ; grat u i t o u s coin age, on t h e ot h e r h a n d , ov erst imu l at ed t h e man u f act u re of coin s f r om bu llion , an d f o rced t h e gen e ral t a x p ay er t o pay f o r min t in g serv ices u t iliz ed by ot h e rs. Having acquired the mintage monopoly, governments fostered the use of the name of the monetary uni t, doi n g thei r best to separate the name from its true base in t h e u n d erly in g w e igh t of t h e coin . T h is, t oo, w a s a h i gh ly import an t st ep, f o r [ 62] it liberated each government from the ne cessity of abiding by the common money of the world market. Instead of using grains or grams of gold or silver, each State fostered i t s own nati onal name i n the su pposed i n terests of monetary patri o ti sm: dollars, mark s, f r an cs, an d t h e lik e. T h e shift made possible the pre¦eminent means of governmental counterfei t ing of coin: debasement. III. Government Meddling With Money 4.

Bimetallism Gov e rn men t imposes price con t rols largely in order t o div e rt pu blic at t e n t ion f r om gov e rn men t al in f l at ion t o t h e alleged ev ils of the free market. As we have seen, \"Gresham's Law\"—that an artifi cially ov erv a lu ed mon e y t e n d s t o driv e an art i f i cially underval u ed money out of ci rcul ati o n—i s an example of the general consequences of price control. Government places, in effe ct, a maximum price on one type of money i n terms of the other. Maxi mum pri c e caus es a shortage—disappearance into hoards or ex port s—of t h e cu rren c y su f f e rin g t h e max i mu m price ( a rt if icially u n d erv a lu ed) , and leads it to be replaced in ci rculation by the overpriced money. We have seen how thi s works i n the ca se of new vs. worn coins, one of the earliest examples of Gresham's Law. C h angi ng the meani n g of money from wei g ht to mere t a le, an d st an dardiz in g denomi nati ons for thei r own rather than for the publ i c 's conveni e nce, the governments cal l e d new [ 64] and worn coins by the same name, even though they were of di fferent wei g ht . As a result, people hoarded or exported t h e f u ll w e igh t n e w coin s, an d passed t h e w o rn coins in circulatio n, wi th governments h u r lin g maledict ion s at \" s pecu lat o rs, \" f o reign e rs, or t h e f r ee mark et in gen e ral, f o r a condition brought about by the government itself. A part icu l arly import an t case of Gres ham's Law was the perenni al probl e m of the \"standard.\" We saw that the free market est a blish e d \" p arallel st an dards\" of gold an d silv er, each f r eely f l u c t u at in g in relat i on t o t h e ot h e r in accordan ce w i t h mark et supplies and demands. But governments deci ded they would help out the market by st eppin g in t o \" s implif y \" mat t e rs. How mu ch clearer t h in gs w o u l d be, t h ey f e lt , if gold and si l v er were fi xed at a defi ni te rati o, sa y, twenty ounces of silver to one ounce of gold! Then, both moneys co uld always circulate at a fixed ratio—and, far more i m portantl y, the government co ul d fi nal l y ri d i t sel f of the burden of treati ng money by w e igh t in st ead of by t a le. L e t u s imagin e a uni t, the \"rur,\" defi ned by Ruri tani ans as 1/20 of an ounce of gol d . We have seen h o w v i t a l it is f o r t h e gov e rn men t t o i n duce the publ i c to regard the \"rur\" as an abstract uni t of i t s own ri ght, onl y l oosel y connected to gold. What better way of doing thi s than to fi x the gol d /si l v er rati o? Then, \"rur\" becomes not onl y 1/20 ounce of gol d , but also one ounce of silver. The precise mean in g of t h e w o rd \" r u r \" — a n a me f o r gold w e igh t —is n o w lost , an d people begi n to thi n k of the \"rur\" as somethi n g ta n g ible in it s ow n righ t , someh o w set by the government, for good and efficient purpos es, as equal to certai n wei g hts of both gold an d silv er. Now we see the i m portance of abstai ni ng from patri o ti c [65] or nati onal names for gol d ounces or grai ns.

Legal Tender How was the government able to enforce it s price controls on monetary exchange rates? By a device known as legal tender laws .Money i s used for payment of past debts, as wel l as for present \"cash\" transacti o ns. Wi th the name of the country's cu rren c y n o w promin en t in accou n t in g in st ea d its actual weight, contracts began to pledge payment in certai n amounts of \"money.\" Legal tender laws dictated what that \"money\" could be. When only the original gold or silver was designated \"legal t e n d er, \" people con s idered it h a rmless, bu t t h ey sh ou ld h a v e realiz ed t h at a dangerous precedent had been set for go vernment control of money. If the gov e rn men t st ick s t o t h e origin al mon e y , it s legal t e n d er law is su perf lu ou s an d unnecessary. [9] On the other hand, the government [67] may decl are as l e gal tender a l o wer-qual i t y currency si de-by-si d e wi th the ori g i n al . Thus, the government may decree worn coins as good as new ones in paying off debt, of silver and gold equi val e nt to each other i n the fi xed rat i o. T h e legal t e n d er law s t h en brin g Gresham's Law into being. Wh en legal t e n d er law s en sh rin e an overvalued money, they have another effect; they favor debtors at the expense of creditors. For then debtors are permitted to pay back their debts in a much poor er money than they had borrowed, and creditors are swindled out of the money ri gh t f u lly t h eirs. T h is con f iscat i on of creditors property, however, only benefits outstanding debtors; future debt ors w ill be burdened by the scarcity of credit ge nerated by the memory of government spoilation of creditors.

Governmental control of money coul d only become absolute, and its counterfei t i n g unchal l e nged, as money-substi t utes came into prominence in recent centuri e s. The advent of paper money and bank deposits, an economic boon when back ed f u lly by gold or silv er, prov ided the open sesame for government's road to power over money, and thereby ov er the entire economic system. [ 10] The use of foreign coins was prevalent in the Mi ddle Ages and in the United States down to the middle of the 19th century. III. Government Meddling With Money 7. Permitting Banks to Refuse Payment The modern economy, wi th i t s wi despread use of banks and money¦substi t utes, provides the golden opportunity for governme nt to fasten its control over the money su pply an d permit in f l at ion at it s discret ion . We h a v e seen in sect ion 12, page 20, that there are three great checks on the po wer of any bank to inflate under a \"free banking\" system: (1) the extent of the clie ntele of each bank; (2) the extent of the clientele of the whole bank i n g system,i .e., the extent to whi c h peopl e use money- substi tutes, and (3) the confi d ence of th e clients in their banks.

In the United States, mass suspension of specie payment in times of bank troubles became almost a tradition. It started in the War of 1812. Most of the country's banks were located in N e w E n glan d, a sect ion u n s y m pat h et ic t o America' s entry into the war. These banks refused to lend for war purposes, and so the government borrowed from ne w banks in the other states. These banks issued new paper mon e y t o mak e t h e loan s. T h e in f l at io n was so great that calls for redemption fl ooded i n to the new banks, especi al l y fr om the conservati ve [70] nonexpandi ng banks of New England, where the govern ment spent most of its money on war goods. As a result, there was a mass \"sus pension\" in 1814, lasting for over two years (wel l beyond the end of the war); duri ng that ti me, banks sprouted up, i ssui n g notes wi th no need to redeem i n gol d or si l v er. This suspension set a precedent for succeeding economic crises; 1819, 1837, 1857, and so forth. As a result of this trad ition, the banks realiz ed that they need have no fear of bankruptcy after an i n fl ati o n , an d t h is, of cou r se, st imu l at ed in f l at ion an d \" w ildcat ban k in g. \" T h ose w r it ers w h o poin t t o n i n e t een t h cen t u r y America as a horrid example of \"free banking,\" fail to realiz e t h e import an ce of t h is clear derelict i on of du t y by t h e st at es in ev ery f i n a n c ial crisis.

If the banks keep a reserve/deposit ratio of 1:10, then \"excess reserves\" (abo ve the required ratio) of ten million dollars will permit and encour age a nationwide bank inflation of 100 million .

The Central Bank adds to the quanti ty of bank reserves by buying assets on the market. What happens, for example, if th e Bank buys an asset (any asset) from Mr. Jones, valued at $1,000? The Central Ba nk writes out a check to Mr. Jones for $1,000 to pay for the asset. The Central Bank does not keep indi vidual accounts, so Mr. Jones takes the check and deposits it in hi s bank. Jones' bank credi t s hi m wi th a $1,000 deposit, and presents the check to th e Central Bank, which [77] has to credit the bank with an added $1,000 in reserv es. This $1,000 in reserves permits a mu lt iple ban k credit ex pan s ion , part icu l arly if added reserv es are in t h is w a y pou r ed into many banks across the country. If the Central Bank buys an asset from a bank directly, then the result is even clearer; t h e ban k adds t o it s reserv es, an d a base f o r mu lt iple credit ex pan s ion is est a blish e d. Undoubtedl y, the favori te asset fo r Central Bank purchase has been government securi ti es. In that way, the government assures a market for its own securities. Government can easily inflate the money su pply by issuing new bonds, and then orders its Central Bank to purchase them. Often the Central Bank undertakes to support the market price of go vernment securities at a certain level, thereby causing a flow of securities in to the Bank, and a consequent perpetual in f l at ion . Besides buying assets, the C e ntral Bank can create new bank reserves in another way: by l e ndi n g them. The rate wh i c h the Central Bank charges the banks f o r t h is serv ice is t h e \" r ediscou n t rat e . \" Clearly, borrowed reserves are not as sati sfactory to the banks as reserves that are whol l y thei rs, si nce there i s now pressure for repayment. Changes in the rediscount rate receive a great deal of publicity, but they are clearly of minor importance compared to the movements in the quanti ty of bank reserv es and the reserve ratio. Wh en t h e C e n t ral Ban k sells asset s t o t h e ban k s or t h e pu blic, it low e rs ban k reserves, and causes pressure for credit contracti o n and defl ati o n—l o weri ng—of the money suppl y.

Countri es that expand faster are i n danger of gol d l o sses and cal l s upon thei r banking system for gold redemption. This was the classic cyclical pattern of the ni neteenth century; a country's Central Bank woul d generate bank credi t expansi o n; prices would rise; and as the new money spre ad from domesti c to forei g n cl i e ntel e, foreigners would more and more try to redeem the currency i n gol d . Fi nal l y , the Central Bank woul d have to cal l a hal t and enforce a credit contraction in order to save the monetary standard. There is one way that foreign redemption can be avoided: inter-Central Bank cooperat ion . If all C e n t ral Ban k s agree t o i n fl ate at about the same rate, then no country woul d l o se gol d to any other, and al l the worl d together coul d i n fl ate al most w i t h ou t limit . Wit h ev ery gov e rn men t jealou s of it s [ 79] ow n pow e r an d respon siv e to di fferent pressures, howe ver, such goose-step cooperation has so far proved almost impossible. One of the closest appr oaches was the American Federal Reserve agreement to promote domestic inflation in the 1920s in order to help Great Britain and prevent i t from l o si ng gold to the United States. In the twenti eth century, governments, rather than defl ate or l i m i t thei r own i n fl ati o n, have si mpl y \"gone off the gol d standard\" when confronted wi th heavy demands for gold. This, of course, insures th at the Central Bank cannot fai l , si nce i t s notes now become the standard money. In short, government ha s fi nal l y refused to pay its debts, and has virtually absolved th e banking system from that onerous duty. Pseudo-receipts to gold were fi rst i ssued wi thout banki n g and then, when the day of reckoning drew near, the bankruptcy was shamelessly completed by simply elimin at in g gold redempt i on . T h e sev e ran c e of t h e v a riou s n a t i on al cu rren c y n a mes ( d ollar, pou n d , mark ) f r om gold an d silv er is n o w complet e . At fi rst, governments refused to admi t that thi s was a permanent measure. They referred to the \"suspensi o n of speci e payments,\" and it was always understood that eventual l y , after the war or other \"emergency\" had ended, the government w o u l d again redeem it s obligat ion s . Wh en t h e Bank of Engl and went off gol d at the end of the eighteenth century, it continued i n thi s state for twenty years, but al ways wi th the understandi ng that gol d payment would be resumed after the French wars were ended.

In recent years, therefore, govern ments have moved to abol i s h freel y- fluctuating exchange rates. Instead, they fixed arbitrar y exchange rates with other currencies.

Phase I: The Classical Gold Standard, 1815-1914 We can look back upon the \"classical\" gold standard, the Western world of the ni neteenth and earl y twenti eth centuri e s, as the literal and metaph orical Golden Age. With the exception of the troublesome prob lem of silv er, t h e w o rld w a s on a gold standard, which meant that each national currency (the dol l a r, pound, franc, etc.) was merel y a name for a certai n defi ni te weight of gold.

While the Bretton Woods system worked far better than the disaster of the 1930's, it worked onl y as another i n fl ati o nary recrudescenc e of the gold-exchange standard of the 1920s and—like the 1920s—the system lived only on borrowed time. The new system was essentially the go ld-exchange standard of the 1920s but w i t h t h e dollar ru dely displacin g t h e Brit ish pou n d as on e of t h e \" k ey cu rren c ies. \" Now the dol l a r, val u ed at 1/35 of a gol d ounce, was to be the only key [99] currency. The other difference from the 1920s was that the dollar was no longer redeemable in gold to American citizens ; instead, the 1930's system was continued, w i t h t h e dollar redeemable in gold only to foreign governments and their central banks. No private individuals, on ly gov e rn men t s, w e re t o be allow e d t h e priv ilege of redeeming dollars in the world gold curre ncy. In the Bretton Woods system, the United States pyramided dollars (in paper money and in bank deposits) on top of gold, in w h ich dollars cou l d be redeemed by f o reign gov e rn men t s; w h ile all ot h e r governments held dollars as their basic re serve and pyramided their currency on top of dollars. And since the United States bega n the post-war worl d wi th a huge stock of gold (approximately $25 billion) there was plen ty of play for pyra miding dollar claims on top of it.

All t h is, combined with the increasing productivi ty of Europe, and later Japan, led to continuing balance of paymen ts deficits with the United States.

But the classical gold standard check on in f l at ion — especially American inflation—was gone. For the rules of the Bretton Woods game prov ided t h at t h e West E u ropean cou n t ries h a d t o k eep pilin g u p on their reserve, and even use these dollars as a base to inflate their own currency and credit. But as the 1950s and 1960s continued, th e harder-money countries of West Europe (and Japan) became re st less at bein g f o rced t o pile u p dollars t h at w e re n o w increasingly overvalued instead of underva l u ed.

But they were locked into a system that was more and more of a ni ghtmare. The Ameri c an reacti on to the European complaints, headed by France and DeGaulle's major monetary adviser, the classical gold-standard economist Jacques Rueff, was merely scorn and [101] brusque dismissal. American politicians and economists simply declared that Europe was forced t o u s e t h e dollar as it s currency, that i t coul d do nothi n g about i t s growing problems, an d that therefore the U.

But Europe did have the legal option of redeeming dollars in gold at $35 an ou n c e. An d as t h e dollar became in creasin g ly ov erv a lu ed in t e rms of h a rd mon e y currencies and gold, European governments began more and more to exercise that option. The gold standard check was coming into use; hence gold flowed steadily out of the U.S. for two decades after the earl y 1950s, until the U.S. gold stock dwindled over this period from over $20 billion to $9 billion. As dollars kept inflating upon a dwindling gold base, how could the U.S. k eep redeemin g f o reign dollars in gold—t h e cornerstone of the Bretton Woods system ? These problems did not slow down con t in u e d U. S. in f l at ion of dollars an d prices, or t h e U.

Phase VI: The Unraveling of Bretton Woods, 1968-1971 As dollars piled up abroad and gold conti nued to fl ow outward, the U.S. found i t increasingly difficult to main tain the price of gold at $35 an ounce in the free gold markets at London and Zurich . Thirty-five dollars an ounce was the keystone of the system, and while American citizens have been barred since 1934 from owning gold an y w h e re in t h e w o rld, ot h e r cit i z e n s h a v e en joy e d t h e f r eedom t o ow n gold bu llion and coin. Hence, one way for individual Eu ropeans to redeem their dollars in gold was to sell their dollars for gold at $35 an ounce in the free gold market. As the dollar kept inflating and depreciating, and as American balance of payments deficits conti nued, Europeans and othe r private citizens began to accelerate their sales of dollars into gold. In order to keep the do llar at $35 an ounce, the U.S. government was forced to leak out gold from its dw indling stock to support the $35 price at London and Zurich. A crisis of con f iden ce in t h e dollar on t h e f r ee gold mark et s led t h e Un it ed States to effect a fundamental change in the monetary system in March 1968. The idea was to stop the pesky free gold ma rket from ever again endangering the Bretton Woods arrangement. Hence was born the \"two-tier gold market.\" The idea was that the free-gold market could go to bl az es; it w o u l d be st rict ly in su lat e d f r om the real monetary action in the central bank s and governments of the [103] world. The United States would no longer try to keep the free-market gold price at $35; it would ignore the free gold market, and it and all the other governments agreed to keep the value of the dollar at $35 an ounce forevermore. The governments and central banks of the worl d woul d henceforth buy no more gol d from the \"outsi de\" market and would sell no more gold to that market; from now on gol d woul d si mpl y move as counters from one central bank to another, and new gold supplies, free gold market, or private demand for gold wo ul d take thei r own course completely separated from the monetary arrangements of the world. Al ong wi th thi s , the U.S. pushed hard fora the new l a unchi ng of a new ki nd of world paper reserve, Special Drawing Ri ghts (SDRs), whi c h i t was hoped woul d eventually replace gold altogether and se rve as a new world paper currency to be issued by a future World Reserve Bank; if su ch a system were ever established, then the U.S. coul d i n fl ate unchecked foreverm ore, in collaboration with other world gov e rn men t s ( t h e on ly limit w o u l d t h en be the disastrous one of a worldwide runaway inflation and the crackup of th e world paper currency). But the SDRs, combatted i n tensel y as they have been by Western Europe and the \"hard-money\" countri es, have so far been onl y a smal l supplement to American and other currency reserves. All pro- paper econ omist s , f r om K e y n esian s t o F r iedman it es, w e re n o w confident that gold would di sappear from the i n ternati o na l monetary system; cut off from its \"support\" by the dollar, these econ omist s all con f iden t l y predict e d, t h e f r ee- market gold price would soon fall belo w $35 announce, and even down to the estimated \"industrial\" [104] non-monetary gold price of $10 an ounce.

Phase VIII: The Smithsonian Agreement, December 1971 -February 1973 The Smithsonian Agreement, hailed by Pres i d ent Ni xon as the \"greatest monetary agreement in the history of the world,\" wa s even more shaky and unsound than the gold exchange standard of the 1920s or th an Bretton Woods. For once again, the countries of the world pledged to mai n tai n fi xed exchange rates, but thi s ti me wi th no gold or world money to gi ve any currency backi n g. Fu rthermore, many European cu rren c ies w e re f i x e d at u n d erv a lu ed parit i es in relat i on t o t h e dollar; t h e on ly U.

Phase IX: Fluctuating Fiat Currencies, March 1973 -? Wi th the dol l a r breaki ng apart, the worl d shi f ted again, to a system of fl uctuati n g fi at currencies. Within the West European bl ock, exchange rates were ti ed to one another, and the U.S. again deval u ed the offi ci al dol l a r rate by a token amount, to $42 an ounce. As the dollar plunged in fore ign exchange from day to day, and the West German mark, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen hurtl ed upward, the American au t h orit ies, back ed by t h e F r iedman it e econ omist s , began t o t h in k t h at h i s w a s t h e mon e t a ry ideal. It is t r u e t h at dollar su rplu ses an d su dden balan c e of payments crises do not plague the world under fluctuating exchange [107] rates. F u rt h e rmore, American ex port f i rms began t o ch ort l ed t h at f a llin g dollar rat e s made American goods cheaper abroad, and therefor e benefi tted exports.

Bu t it became clear all t oo soon t h at all is f a r f r om w e ll in t h e cu rren t in t e rn at ion a l mon e t a ry sy st em. T h e lon g fun probl e m i s that the hard money cou n t ries w ill n o t sit by f o rev e r an d w a t c h t h eir cu rren c ies become more ex pen s iv e and thei r exports hurt for the benefi t of th eir American competitors. If American in f l at ion an d dollar depreciat i on con t in u e s, t h ey w ill soon sh if t t o t h e compet in g devaluation, exchange controls, currency blocs, and economic warfare of the 1930s. But more immediate is the other side of th e coin : t h e f a ct t h at depreciat i n g dollars means that American imports are far more expensi v e, Ameri c an touri s ts suffer abroad, and cheap exports are snapped up by forei g n countri es so rapidly as to raise prices of exports at home (e.g., the Amer ican wheat-and-meat price in f l at ion ) . So that American exporters might indeed be nefi t, but onl y at the expense of the i n fl ati o n-ri dden Ameri c an consumer. The cri ppling uncertainty of rapid exchange rate fl uctuati o ns was brought starkl y home to Ameri c ans wi th the rapi d pl unge of the dollar in foreign exchange markets in July 1973. Since the U.S. went completely off go ld in August 1971 and established the Friedmanite fluctuating fiat system in Ma rch 1973, the United States and the world have suffered the most intense and most su stained bout of peacetime [108] inflation i n the hi story of the worl d. It shoul d be cl ear by now that thi s i s scarcel y a coincidence. Before the dollar was cut loose f r om gold, k e y n esian s an d F r iedman it es, each in their own way devote d to fiat paper money, conf i d entl y predi c ted that when f i at mon e y w a s est a blish e d, t h e mark et price of gold w o u l d f a ll prompt ly t o it s n o n - monetary l e vel , then esti mated at about $8 an ounce. In thei r scorn of gol d , both groups mai n tai n ed that i t was the mi ghty dollar that was propping up the price of gold, and not vice versa. Since 1971, the ma rket price of gold has never been below the old fixed price of $35 an ounce, and ha s almost always been enormously higher.

T h e F r iedman it e dream of f l u c t u at in g f i at mon e y lies in ash e s, and there is an understandable yearning to return to an i n ternati o nal money wi th fixed exchange rates. [109] Unfortunately, the classical gold standard l i e s forgotten, and the ul ti mate goal of most American and world leaders is the ol d Keynesi a n vi si on of a one-world fiat paper standard, a new curre ncy uni t i ssued by a Worl d Reserve Bank (WRB). Whether the new currency be termed \"the bancor\" (offered by Keynes), the \"uni ta\" (proposed by World War II U.S. Treasury offi ci al Harry Dexter Whi t e), or the \"phoenix\" (suggested by The Economist ) is u n i mport a n t .

While a world-wide paper uni t and central bank remai n the ul ti mate goal of w o rld' s K e y n esian - orien t ed leaders, t h e more realist i c an d prox imat e goal is a ret u rn to a gl ori f i e d Bretton Woods scheme, except thi s ti me wi thout the check of any backing in gold. Already the world's ma jor central banks are attempti ng to \" c oordin a t e \" mon e t a ry an d econ omic policies, h a rmon iz e rat e s of in f l at ion , an d f i x exchange rates. The militant drive for a E u ropean paper currency [110] issued by a E u ropean central bank seems on the verge of success.
