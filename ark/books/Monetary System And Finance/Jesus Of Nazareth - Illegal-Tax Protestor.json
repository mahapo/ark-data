On most days, I turn first to the Gospels, paying particular attention to the words Jesus spoke. I have also devoted 135 days to concentrated Gospel study while incarcerated in several jails for violating various man-made laws that impinge upon my God-given right to liberty. Because I took Jesusí principles to jail with me, my days of incarcerations were joyful and productive. My purpose in focusing on the Gospels has been to know Jesus as best I can. Jesus spent his youth studying the Scriptures. So I read the Old Testament to gain insight into the mind of the most remarkable and influential man of all time. I read the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, paying particular attention to the words and actions attributed to Jesus in an effort to know this unique son of God as best I can. I read the Epistles, Revelation, and other ancient works relevant to Jesus by various authors to learn what others thought of him and how they have understood him. To this exercise, I bring the wisdom, education and experience God has given me, plus, I hope, enough humility to re cognize and admit when I am wrong. In the course of writing this essay, I have asked God for knowledge of His will for me and the wisdom, courage and power to carry it out. I have also solicited help from one and all w ho may be willing and able to point out weaknesses or suggest improvements. Such generous assistance has been forthcoming and has improved the essay a hundred-fold in the course of its numerous revisions. I have received many benefits from studying the Gospels and trying to live by Jesusí words. For example, I donít have health insurance, but I have"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4 near-perfect health. I have no regular source of income, yet all my material needs are continuously met in a timely fashion on a daily basis. I have relatively few possessions, yet I am abundantly rich. I have foresworn the use of force in the conduct of my a ffairs, even in self-defense, yet I am invulnerable to harm from others in an often-violent world. I have no fear of going anywhere on earth or consorting with anyone if I have good cause to do so. As long as my motives are pure, God keeps me from all harm. I am a long way from sainthood, but I do have a vital, fruitful relationship with God. For these and many other benefits, I hold Jesus of Nazareth fundamentally responsible. I have also been the beneficiary of an important revelation about the character of Jesus, which I believe came from Jesus. It did not arrive in a vision or a blinding flash. Rather it came through a gradually growing-until- unshakable conviction that I know something about Jesus many people should know, but do not. If more people knew where Jesus stood regarding taxes and the state, the world would be a better place. Of equal import, this insight serves to negate some absurd and demeaning allegations, which continue to be made concerning the char acter of Jesus by many scholarly commentators on the Bible. For thes e reasons, I am obliged to share what has been revealed to me by Jesus. This essay, therefore, is a duty. I (Ned Netterville) am not a Christian, but many of those who have contributed to improving this essay are. I personally do not profess any religion. However, I do have a profound faith in God, as I understand God. My faith and understanding of God are derived in large measure from the words and deeds of Jesus, which are credibly attributed to him, as well as from personal experience. I have ac hieved benevolent results from trying,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"5 however haltingly, to adopt the principles Jesus preached and follow his example. My faith isnít necessarily logical, except in the sense that it passes the ultimate test of logic, a test I learned from Jesus, to wit: Does it work? Does it bear fruit? My faith in God and in the wisdom of Jesus works so well it has become imbedded in my psyche. That doesnít mean my beliefs canít change, rather it means my faith in God is steadfast. I may not be a Christian, but I am a disciple of Jesus. And I donít blame Jesus for flaws I perceive in Christianity. I finished the original draft of this essay in 1997 and first published a version of it on the Internet in A ugust of 2004. Since then, the essay has been frequently and extensively revised with the help of many people. Thus, I no longer claim it as my own. With generous help from people who found the essay on the Internet and submitted comments and constructive criticism, pointing out weaknesses and errors, and with the invaluable assistance in every facet of its composition from the talented members of my writers group, the essay has vastly improved. Thanks to the help of others, I am now confident the essay fairly reflects the wisdom and character of Jesus. Any remaining errors are my own. Nevertheless, I have gone through the essay from the end of this Introduction to the beginning of the Addendum, replacing the words ìIî and ìmeî with ìweî and ìourî to acknowledge this as the work of a confederacy."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6 PREFACE: EXEGESIS AND HERMENEUTICS Exegesis is the science of textual interpretation, usually referring to the Bible. The specific techniques employed in the exegesis of Scripture are referred to as hermeneutics. Scholars who labor in the discipline are called exegetes, a title, which for lack of adequate alternatives, is used ad nauseam hereinafter. This preface was added in response to some early negative criticism. Two groups have been particularly vociferous. Christian fundamentalists donít like it at all. Nor do some people whose bread is buttered with tax revenues, who may feel threatened or perhaps antagonized by the essay for impugning the morality of tax collectors and tax beneficiaries. Curiously, both groups usually fault the essay along the same line. They protest that we rely on passages from the Bible, particularly from the Gospels, to make certain points, while ignoring, dismissing or even disputing the validity of other passages that tend to refute our theses. We confess: Guilty as charged. But we profess that all who read the Bible and reach conclusions do the same. In its English translations, the Bible has been through many hands. Some have made alterations, if only to make it clearerñby their way of thinking. Others may have had less honorable motives. Many changes have occurred as the result of human errors in translating and transcribing. For an insightful recent analysis of the innumerable changes, intentional and accidental, for good cause and bad, which have been made to the New Testament, see the book, Misquoting Jesus, The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why, by Bart D. Ehrman (New York, Harper Collins Publisher, 2005)."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"7 The Bible is rife with contradictions. For example, according to Matthewís account, Jesus and his apostles are about to leave for Gethsemane where he will be arrested. He tells them, ìëHe that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.î (Mt 22:36, King James Version--KJV) Later that night, according to Johnís account, when Peter uses his sword to defend Jesus, the Lord chastises him saying, ìPut up your sword into the sheath; the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?î (Jn 19:11 KJV) If both accounts are true, why did Jesus, the Prince of Peace, first tell his apostles to arm themselves as for a fight, then chastise Peter for using his sword? How are such conflicts to be understood without resorting to deductive reasoning aided by oneís existing knowledge of what has been written or said about him, plus any personal knowledge of the risen Jesus one may have received. Here is another glaring contradiction in the canonical gospelsí accounts of the Passion of Christ. In the accounts in Matthew, Mark and John, Pilateís soldiers put a scarlet robe on Jesus, place a crown of thorns on his head, and mock him, whereas in Luke, Pilate sends Jesus to Herod, whose soldiers put an elegant robe on him and mock him. Matthew, Mark and John do not even mention Herod. Such glaring discrepancies might induce a jury to reject the testimony of all four evangelists as unreliable. According to one dictionary, fundamentalism is ìreligious beliefs based on a literal interpretation of everything in the Bible and regarded as fundamental to Christian faith and morals.î Some fundamentalists even hold that only the 1611 King James Version of the Bible contains the inerrant word of God.

For an elucidation of the many textual discrepancies in the KJV, but particularly the Greek manuscript(s) from which it was translated, see Ehrmanís Misquoting Jesus (p. 78-83). Although the Bible is surely inspired by God, it clearly is not inerrant. For one thing, too many men have messed with it. In addition, it is evident that God didnít intend all of it to be taken literally. The story of Creation in Genesis, while it contains Divine insight and insight into the Divine, is obviously allegorical. Many Christ ians who are not fundamentalists agree. This essay contains three hypotheses . The primary thesis is that, contrary to what most people have been led to believe by their church and government leaders, Jesus did not condone taxation nor endorse the concept of the nation-state when he said ìrender unto Caesar therefore the things which are Caesarís.î If the essay succeeds in persuading some readers of that one point, and we are confident those who read it with an open mi nd will be persuaded, our research, writing and prayers will be vindicated. The second hypothesis is this: Jesus taught and lived by principles diametrically opposed to government and taxes . If that is true, then those who would live their lives according to the principles Jesus taught will neither collect, receive, nor voluntarily pay taxes, nor be involved with the state in any way that can possibly be avoided. Finally, although Jesus died of his own volition in compliance with his Fatherís will in order to save mankind from sin, which may be the most important fact to know about Jesus, our third hypothesis holds that it is likely and eminently logical to believe that Pontius Pilate crucified"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9 Jesus for ìforbidding the payment of taxes to Caesarî and teaching his disciples that taxation is condemned by Godís commandment, Thou shall not steal. Pilate obviously didnít kill Jesus to save mankind from sin, although Jesus died for that purpose. Did he die to save us from taxes? If, as this essay shows, taxes are sinful because they violate Godís Commandment, it follows as night follows day that indeed he did. The first two of these theses are scripturally and logically unassailable. The third, which really generates heat among those who believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God, is grounded less on Scripture than on logical assumptions supported by historical and economic analysis of the scriptural events as well as by common sense. The Scriptural evidence is there, but making the case requires deductive reasoning. All four canonical-Gospel accounts of the trial of Jesus either state or imply that Pilate was not persuaded by the evidence of Jesusí guilt and would have released him. However, against his better judgment and over the protests of his wife, he crucified Jesus to placate the leading Jews, who were demanding crucifixion, and/or, to appease the crowd of onlookers who were threatening to become unruly if Pilate did not bow to the priestsí demand. This is said about a Roman ruler with perhaps a legion of Roman soldiers at hand, a ruler who had dem onstrated contempt for the leading Jews in the past, and had once ordered his soldiers to ruthlessly extinguish the protests of a similar mob of agitating Jews when they opposed another one of his decisions, killi ng and wounding many of them in the process? The canonical Gospelsí presumptionsñand that is all they are--of Pilateís motives for executing Jesus are illogical. That he would crucify a tax protester is not."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 Although scriptural support of the essayís third thesis may be minimal but not entirely lacking, we believe it is well worth our readersí thoughtful consideration. The critical tool for discerning the truth of any event in the life of Jesus that is historically unknowable is going to be the readerís own God-given intellect and life experience, including oneís faith in God. Those who do not believe everything they hear from the pulpit may come to agree that Jesus was killed because Pilate dare not dismiss the inflammatory accusation that Jesus had been teaching people that taxes violated the law of God. He had been doing so within Pilateís jurisdiction, which augured great harm to Pilate, who was accountable to Rome for imperial tax collections in Judea. If the Bible has been altered, how can anyone know what Jesus really said or did? The prolific scholar-author John Dominic Crossan in his monumental investigation into the historical Jesus ( The Historical Jesus, The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant, New York, Harper Collins, 1991), applied the tools of science to the problem. He ranked the likelihood that Jesus actually said or did whatever has been attributed to him in the records that survives from the first one-hundred and fifty years of the common era. (The designation for the common era is CE, a modern equivalent of AD. It seems to be preferred by scholars who apparently disliked using AD, which is short for Anno Domini , a Latin term meaning \"in the year of the Lord.\" AD is used to indicate a date after the traditional date of the birth of Christ. BC, meaning before Christ, is now BCE among academics, meaning before the common era.) A scientific approach we would recommend is experimentation.

Those that work to make life better may safely be credited to Jesus. Overcoming long-standing and demeaning characterizations of Jesus by orthodox exegetes who put words in his mouth he never uttered wonít be easy nor likely without Godís intercession. The influence of the exegetes has thoroughly corrupted the Christian church. Nevertheless, we are confident that abominable lies claiming Jesus endorsed taxes and the state will eventually be discarded by all but the most rabid fundamentalists plus those who worship the state as thei r deity. When that comes about, chalk up another victory on Jesusí scorecard for leading the way."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 CHAPTER 1 : GUILTY! CRUCIFY THE TAX REBEL When Jesus was brought before Pontius Pilate by high-ranking Jews who wanted him crucified, the Gospel of Luke records the event as follows: ìThen the assembly rose as a body and brought Jesus before Pilate. They began to accuse him, saying, ëWe found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king.î Lk 23:1-2 (New Revised Standard Version Bible, New York, Oxford University Press, 1989. Note: The NRSV is quoted throughout this essay unless otherwise indicated.) Was Jesus guilty of these charges? Most Bible scholars are of the opinion he was not. However, we intend to show that the Gospels and other reliable evidence demonstrate conc lusively those scholars are wrong. The record is clear. At least on the count of forbidding the payment of taxes to Caesar, Jesus was guilty! Thus, pursuant to Roman law, he was a dangerous criminal who warranted the sentence Pilate handed down. The criminal cause of action preferred against Jesus before Pilate of ìperverting our nationî must be interpreted to mean the Roman nation, not Israel. Israel at the time was not a nation but an imperial province of the Roman Empire. Moreover, the charge could hardly refer to the Jewish nation because perverting the Jewish nation would be of no concern to a Roman magistrate administering Roman law. The specification, ìforbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor,î was brought not only because it was likely to incite Pilateís wrath against Jesus, but also because it could be supported by solid evidence. Further more, regarding the tax charge, his accusers were justifiably confident Jesus would not run from anything he had previously said or done. Resisting the emperorís tax augured harm to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"13 Pilate and to Rome, not Israel. One who called himself a king within the Roman Empire, without leave of the emperor, challenged Caesarís sovereign authority, not Israelís, which at the time had no sovereign authority whatsoever having been subjugated by Rome. Let us analyze the legal case against Jesus. The cause of action was that Jesus had been perverting the Roman nat ion. The specifications of the charge were two-fold, or in legal terms, there were two counts. Jesus was accused of perverting the nation (the c ause of action) by forbidding taxes (count one), and perverting the nation (sam e cause of action) by claiming to be the Messiah, which his accusers equated with calling himself a king (count two). The word pervert means, according to Websterís New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (New York, Simon & Schuster, 2nd Ed., 1983), ìto cause to turn from what is considered right, natural, or true: to misdirect: to lead astray: to corrupt.î Perverting a nation-state would be equivalent to the crime of sedition in modern legal parlance. Bouvierís Law Dictionary (Cleveland, OH, Banks-Baldwin Law Publishing Company, 1946) defines sedition as ìThe raising commoti ons or disturbances in the state: it is a revolt against legitimate authority.î (p. 1098) The reason why his accusers brought two counts is best explained by Bouvierís definition of the word ìcountî: One object proposed in inserting two or more counts in one declaration when there is in fact but one cause of action, is, in some cases, to guard against the danger of an insufficient statement of the cause, where a doubt exists as to the legal sufficiency of one or another of two different modes of declaring (p.240). Jesusí accusers had cause to worry about the sufficiency of the count"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 charging him with calling himself a king. One problem: Pilate had to accept his accusersí translation of the word ìMessiahî as meaning a king, a dubious rendering at best. Also, even if it could be shown that Jesus had called himself a king, Pilate might be reluctant to crucify him on that count, which in the event proved to be the case. The claim of kingship over the lowly Jews was more likely to elicit a good laugh than a death sentence from the haughty Roman procurator. Unless Pilate perceived Jesusí purported claim to be king of the Jews as a real threat to Caesarís sovereignty or to his own authority in Judea, count two was unlikely to rise to a capital offense. Jesus never pretended to an earthly kingship, but of course he had acknowledged he was the Messiah, meaning the Christ, the anointed one of God: He said to them (viz., his apostles), ìBut who do you say that I am?î Simon Peter answered, ìYou are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.î And Jesus answered him, ìBlessed art you Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven.î (Mt l6:l5-18) Also, when Jesus was passing through Samaria, in the city of Sychar, the following was part of a conversation he had with a Samaritan woman: ìThe woman said to him, ëI know that Messiah is coming (who is called Christ). When he comes he will proclaim all things to us.í Jesus said, ëI am he, the one who is speaking to you.íî (Jn 4:25-26) According to the Gospel of Mark, Jesus also acknowledged he was the Messiah after he was arrested at Gethsemane and brought before the Sanhedrin, a seventy member council co mprised of the high priest, chief"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"15 priests, elders and scribes. ìAgain the high priest asked him, ëAre you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?í Jesus said, ëI am.íî (Mk 14: 61-62) In the accounts of Matthew and Luke, when asked this question, Jesus responded, ìYou say so.î Jesusí adversaries among the Jews defined Messiah for Pilate because as a Roman he might not be familiar with that uniquely Hebrew word. But the word Messiah and the word king are not interchangeable. His accusers were being less than honest, and Pilate had lived long enough among the Jews and their language to perhaps know it. Furthermore, Jesus never claimed to be a king. As we will show, he rejected the concept of human kings and kingdoms. However, on one occasion in the Gospels he did refuse to chastise his disciples when they impetuously referred to him as a king. According to Luke, it happened when Jesus triumphantly entered Jerusalem on the occasion now celebrated as Palm Sunday: As he was now approaching the path down from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen, saying, ìBlessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven! î Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, ìTeacher, order your disciples to stop.î He answered, ìI tell you, if these were silent, the stones would shout out.î (Lk 19:37-40) Because he declined to silence his disciples, it might be argued Jesus had tacitly accepted responsibility for thei r words. Throughout his ministry, by word and deed, Jesus demonstrated knowledge and approval of the legal intendment of the master-servant, or principal-agent relationship. He even"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 lectured on it (see, e.g., Mt l0:24ff, 10:40ff, 25:14ff, 25:34f). Bouvierís Law Dictionary provides the following definit ion of the master-servant relationship: The master is answerable for every such wrong of the servant or agent as is committed by him in the course of the service and for the masterís benefit, though no express command or privity of the master be proved. Such liability springs out of the relation itself, and does not depend on the stipulations of their c ontract. Within the scope of his authority, the servant may be said to be the medium through which the master acts; it follows, as a gener al rule, that for the tortious acts of the servant the master is liable. (p. 765) So, on the questionable basis of this one incident, and by invoking that principle and holding the crowd as his agents, which is really a stretch, a fitfully flawed case might be made that Jesus had called himself a king because he did not prevent his followers from referring to him as a king. However, it is evident Pilate found the charge to be trivial. Pilate spoke to them again, ìThen what do you want me to do with the man you call the king of the Jews?î They shouted back, ìCrucify him.î Pilate asked them, ìWhy, what evil has he done?î (Mk 15:12-14) Then Pilate asked, ìAre you the king of the Jews?î He answered, ìYou say so.î Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, ìI find no basis for an accusation against this man.î (Lk 23:3-4) The first count, however, of forbidding people to pay taxes to the emperor, was clearly a capital offense supported by solid evidence. Pilate as procurator would be particularly sensitive to a charge of resisting taxes. It was a simple matter to prove Jesusí guilt. Principles he had openly"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"17 preached stand in opposition to paying or receiving taxes. This man of flawless integrity would have to deny the truth and repudiate Godís law in order to win an acquittal on the tax charge, which Jesus would never do. In essence, Jesus stood convicted by his righteous principles. His impeccably honesty precluded Jesus from denying the truth to avoid conviction for violating Roman laws prohibiting tax resistance. Pilate was personally accountable to Rome for the collection of taxes throughout the province of Judea. T he position of a Roman procurator is analogous to a District Director of the Internal Revenue Service in the United States today. (See, Historical Introduction to the Studyí of Roman Law , H. F. Jolowicz, London, Cambridge University Press, 1932, pp. 344- 348) The accounts in the canon Gospels of the trial of Jesus do not record how Pilate ruled on the charge of tax resistance after it was preferred. There is one other comment in the Gospel of Luke, which probably refers to the fact that Jesus was teaching people to resist taxes. His accusers told Pilate, ìHe (Jesus) stirs up people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.î (Lk 23:5) Tax resistance is illegal in all places and is universally judged to be an infamous form of sedition. What other possible doctrine might Jesus have been teaching, which his accusers supposed would induce Pilate to crucify him? The most logical conclusion is they were referring to principles he was preaching that confuted Roman taxes, and to the revolutionary impact his preaching was having upon a growing number of people. In Johnís Gospel, soon after Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, there is this telling passage: ìSo the chief priests and the Pharisees called a"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"18 meeting of the council, and said, ëWhat are we to do? This man is performing many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.íî (Jn 11:47-48) What, it must be asked, was Jesus preaching, which if accepted by the Jewish people, would incite Rome to annihilate the already subjugated Jews? Again, the most logical answer is that Jesus was teaching his followers a dangerous truth, that taxes violate Godís law. This likely would have led some of his followers to resist or stop paying their taxes. Rome could not maintain its hegemony over the lands it had conquered if it could not enforce its taxes. The leading Jews well knew what Rome would do to the Israelites to protect the tax revenues upon which its mighty empire depended. It would destroy both the Temple and the religious hierarchy.. According to the four canon-Gospelsí accounts, Pilate was unimpressed by the charge that Jesu s had been calling himself a king. He astutely determined the charge was prompted by the accusersí jealousy of Jesus. (Mt 26:l8ff, Mk 15:10ff, Lk 23:iff, Jn 18:33) He wanted to release Jesus, but the leading Jews incited the on-looking crowd to demand Jesus be put to death, and Pilate caved into their demands. (Mt 26:24, Mk 15:15, Lk 23:23, Jn 19:12) Nothing is said in any of these accounts of the trial to indicate Pilate even considered the c harge of ìforbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor.î Yet it is logically indisputable that the man in charge of collecting taxes and accountable to Rome for doing so would not have ignored such a provocative charge. As imperial director of taxation for Judea, Pilate obviously would care far more about the tax charge than the trivial king-of-the-Jews count."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"19 Something is obviously missing from the Gospel accounts, perhaps because the narratives that eventually became the four Gospels were first told by men who had fled from Jesusí captors on the previous evening when he was arrested at Gethsemane. His apostles all deserted him, and likely avoided the trial fearing they might be caught and charged as accomplices. Jesus had admonished them beforehand, ìYou will all become deserters because of me this night, for it is wr itten, `I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.íî (M t 26:31) Thus, the reports of the trial, which were not written down until considerably after the fact, and which eventually became the Gospels, we re based on second-hand information at best. In todayís legal parlance that is hearsay, not admissible as reliable evidence in American courts of law. The source for this sensible explanation of missing critical evidence in the canonical Gospelsí passion narratives is John Dominic Crossan. (See his books, The Cross that Spoke , 1988, Jesus, a Revolutionary Biography , 1994. and Who Killed Jesus , 1995, San Francisco, Harper & Rowe). It is also possible the canon Gospels were altered to exonerate the role Rome and its taxes played in the murder of Jesus. The oldest surviving complete manuscripts of the Gospels were written after the Christian church was subsumed by Rome and dependent upon Roman taxes. It is much more logical to conclude the haughty Roman procurator crucified Jesus as an ìillegal tax protester,î than it is to deduce that Pilate was frightened by a crowd of lowly Jews into doing what he would rather not do. (Note: The term illegal tax protester was coined by the IRS to describe and simultaneously denigrate those Americans who openly oppose its collection procedures. After decades of official use by the IRS, Congress"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 lately ordered the Service to banish the term from its lexicon.) As district director of taxation in Judea, Pilate dare not dismiss the incendiary charge that Jesus was ìforbiddingî his numerous followers to pay taxes. Without Pilateís memoir, we are reduced to speculating on what motivated him to convict and crucify Jesus. The accusation of kingship over the lowly Jews was manifestly more curiosity than concern to the arrogant procurator, whereas tax resistance posed a serious threat to the empire and to Pilate personally. It would only be pragmatic for Pilate to kill one lowly Jew rather than risk the possibility ther e was even a kernel of truth in the accusation that Jesus was encouraging tax resistance? Throughout recorded history, governments have dealt harshly and often summarily with tax resisters. Here in the United States, due-process requirements and other constitutional safeguards afforded other criminals, as a matter of course, are routinely denied to those the IRS describes as ìillegal tax protesters.î Like Pilate, members of the federal judiciary are entirely dependent on the revenues of taxation and brook no pity for those whose words or actions threaten their munificent emoluments and erode the foundation of their powerful jurisdiction. The Cons titution with its Bill of Rights is of no consequence whatsoev er when government revenues are threatened. (See, A Law Unto Itself , by David Burnham, New York, Random House, 1989; and, The Federal Mafia , by Irwin Schiff, Las Vegas, Freedom Books, 1990) Government courts perforce protec t government revenues at all costs, justice or judicial integrity notwithstanding.

Schiff was convicted and sent enced to over 13 years in prison! Such treatment of tax resisters in the United States today is not far removed from ancient Romeís in terms of its brutality. If anyone doubts the truth of these words, let them read the transcripts of Irwin Schiffís criminal trial. (CR-S-O4-0019-KJD-LRL, United States District Court for the District of Nevada) It is historically manifest that Pilate would not be cowed by a crowd of agitating Jews into crucifying Jesus against his better judgment, as the four canonical-Gospel accounts imply. Pilate well knew how to silence such protesters. The renowned Jewish hi storian, Josephus Flavius (37-100 AD/CE), who was nearly Jesusí contemporary, provided the following account of Pilateís response to an earlier attempt by a crowd of Jews to intimidate him into acting contrary to his own judgment. The incident is indicative of Pilateís utter contempt for Jewish law and the Jewish people. But now Pilate, the procurator of Judea, removed the army from Caesarea to Jerusalem, to take their winter quarters there, in order to abolish the Jewish laws...Pilate undertook to bring a current of water to Jerusalem, and did it with the sacred money, and derived the origin of the stream from a distance of two hundred furlongs. However, the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 Jews were not pleased with what had been done about this water; and many ten thousands of the people got together, and made a clamor against him, and insisted that he should leave off that design. Some of them also used reproaches, and abused the man, as crowds of such people usually do. So he habited a great number of his soldiers in their habit, who carried daggers under their garments, and sent them to the place where they might surround them. So he bid the Jews himself go away; but they boldly casting reproaches upon him, he gave the soldiers that signal which had been beforehand agreed on; who laid upon them much greater blows than Pilate had commanded them, and equally punished those who were tumultuous and those who were not; nor did they spare them in the least; and since the people were unarmed, and were caught by men prepared for what they were about, there were a great number of them slain by this means, and others of them ran away wounded. And thus an end was put to this sedition. (p. 575-576, Flavius, Josephus, Josephus The Complete Works , circa 70CE, Translated by William Whiston in 1737, Nashville, Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1998) In addition to the canonical Gospels, other early records of the life of Jesus include brief comments by Josephus and by the Roman historian Tacitus (55-117AD). Furthermore, archaeologists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have uncovered fragmentary documents, which are generally held to be authentic, containing early accounts of Jesus and the words he spoke. Many non-canonical documents were s uppressed by the Christian church after it became the official church of Rome during the reign of Constantine. The documents include such tracts as t he Gospel of Peter, the Gospel of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"23 Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.

For the Gospels of Thomas and of Mary Magdalene, see The Nag Hammadi Library in English (San Francisco, CA, Harper Publishing, 1994) In this essay we will present evidenc e to show Jesus was crucified for stirring up opposition to Caesarís tax by the principles of nonviolence he was preaching. For example, the principle of doing to others only what you would have them do to you precludes the use of force in the conduct of human affairs. Taxes, of course, depend utterly on force for their collection and were thereby condemned. And it follows as night follows day the same nonviolent principles that condemn ta xation confute the very existence of the nation-state. (Imagine a nation-st ate without taxes--and stop grinning.) Thus, Jesus may justly be described as an anarchist! The definition of anarchism relied on to make this case is found in Websterís New Universal Unabridged Dictionary. (New York, Simon & Schuster, 1983): ìthe theory that formal government of any kind is unnecessary and wrong in principle.î Those, like Jesus, whose principles preclude having anything to do with the state are anarchists. (See the essay, ìJesus was an Anarchist,î by James Redford, available on the web at www.anti- state.com/redford/redford4.html .) All governments assert the authority to initiate force against innocent people, if for no other reason--and there are always many other reasons-- than to enforce collection of taxes, the lifeblood of the state. George Washington reportedly said, ìGovernment is not reason, it is not eloquence,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 it is force, and force like fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.î The prerequisite of force upon which the state utterly depends for its existence is the reason why the Jesus-principles stand in stark condemnation of the state in all of its emanations. The leading Jews of his day believed that Jesusí testimony to the truth threatened their cozy relationship with Rome and they wanted him out of the way. They repeatedly misjudged Jesus. They were often shamed and embarrassed by his words and deeds in front of crowds of people they lusted to impress. They refused to believe he was the Messiah foretold by the prophets in their ancient Scriptures. As thoroughly as the leading Jews misunderstood Jesus, they nevertheless knew him better than mo st exegetes. We have checked most of the so-called ìinterpreter Bibles,î ìBible commentaries,î and ìBible expositionsî found in major research libraries. The authors of these exhaustive, often multi-volume tomes uniformly fail to comprehend, and thus misinterpret, the meaning and significance of a few words Jesus uttered on one particular and very important occasion, which are recorded in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, as well as in the Gospel of Thomas. In so doing, these scholars misrepresent and demean the character of Jesus to a degree bordering on character assassination."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"25 CHAPTER 2: RENDER UNTO CAESAR We refer to the important occasion as the ìrender-unto-Caesar incident.î It is recounted in all three synoptic Gospels (Mt, Mk, and Lk) with near unanimity among the three authors regarding what happened and what Jesus said at the time. The nearly identical Gospel accounts suggest the significance of what transpired upon the occasion should not be lost, and the lessons contained in Jesusí words and actions should not be misconstrued. But that is exactly what happened. This essay endeavors to correct a gross distortion of the record, which has been perpetrated by many if not most orthodox Bible exegetes. These scholars slander the character of Jesus and pervert an impor tant principle he espoused by their unfounded misrepresentation of the intendment of what Jesus said on the occasion of this fascinating incident. The Gospel of Matthew reports numerous encounters between Jesus and his enemies among religionist Jews prior to the render-unto-Caesar incident. (See, Mt 9:3ff, 9:11ff, 9:23ff, 9:34ff, 12:2ff, 12:14ff, 12:22ff, 12:38ff, 13:54ff, 15:1ff, 16:1ff, 19:3ff, 21:l5ff, 21:13ff, 21:45) The Gospels identify his antagonists as scribes, chief priests, elders, Sadducees, Herodians and Pharisees. These frequent encounters between Jesus and his adversaries provide a preponderance of evidence t hat his enemies knew first hand what Jesus was teaching and much about his character and temperament. His enemies realized Jesusí teaching regarding taxes was sedition, dangerous to Rome and dangerous to them. Jesusí adversaries were loyal to the Roman state for the advantages Rome bestowed on them in order to secure their cooperation in subjugating and taxing their fellow Jews of lower estate and less political clout. When Pontius Pilate hesitated to crucify"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 Jesus at their urging, he asked sarcastically, ìShall I crucify your king?î The chief priests replied emphatically, ìWe have no king but the emperor.î (Jn: 19-15) The leading Jews were on solid ground in believing they could bring Jesus to grief with the Roman authorities by inducing him to speak his mind on taxes. It was clear where Jesus stood on the issue of taxes from the principles he taught and from explicit comments he had made regarding taxes and tax collectors. They also knew from experience that Jesus would not shrink from expressing his views out of fear for his safety or because his wordsñthe truth--would offend someone. The enemies of Jesus were therefore justifiably confident he would incriminate himself of opposing Romeís taxes if they could get him to express his opinion on the subject in the presence of potential adverse witne sses. Rome, like every other state, did not tolerate opposition to its taxes, which financed the empire and the many benefits of Roman citizenship. Let us turn to the three canon-Gospel writersí accounts of the render- unto-Caesar incident from the NRSV Bible. MATTHEW: Then the Pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said. So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, ìTeacher, we know that you are si ncere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us then, what do you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?î But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, ìWhy are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.î And they brought him a denarius."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27 Then he said to them, ìWhose head is this, and whose title?î They answered, ìThe emperorís.î Then he said to them, ìGive therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperorís, and to God the things that are Godís.î When they heard this they were amazed; and they left him and went away. (Mt 22:15-22) MARK Then they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said. And they came and said to him, ìTeacher, we know that you are sincere, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?î But knowing their hypocrisy he said to them, ìWhy are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.î And they brought one. Then he said to them, ìWhose head is this, and whose title?î They answered, ìThe emperorís.î Jesus said to them, ìGive to the emperor the things that are the emperorís, and to God the things that are Godís.î And they were utterly amazed at him. (Mk 12:13-17) LUKE: So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest, in order to trap him by what he said, so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor. So they asked him, ìTeacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and you show deference to no one, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not?î But he perceived their craftiness and said to them, ìShow me"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"28 a denarius.

(Lk 20: 20-26) The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas is attributed to the apostle Thomas, called Didymus, who was known forever after as Doubting Thomas for his unbelief in Jesusí resurrection (see, Jn 20:24-29). Thomasí Gospel contains a much briefer account of the same incident: They showed Jesus a gold coin and said to him, ìCaesarís men demand taxes from us.î He said to them, ìGive Caesar what belongs to Caesar, give God what belongs to God, and give me what is mine.î ( The Nag Hammadi Library in English, op. cit.) We may assume, based on the other Gospels, that ìtheyî in this account are the spies of the canonical accounts sent to trap Jesus in speech. Thomas doesnít provide any details . The word ìrenderî as opposed to ìgiveî is used in the King James Version of the Bible (The Holy Bible. Authorized King James Version , National Bible Press, Philadelphia, originally translated into English in 1611)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"29 CHAPTER 3: BLASPHEMY These accounts of the render-unto- Caesar incident, a brief encounter between Jesus and the emissaries of those who eventually succeeded in seeing him put to death by the Roman state, provide considerable insight into the character of Jesus, and into his regard for taxes. It helps to know what transpired immediately preceding the incident. All three synoptic Gospels concur. As Matthew tells us (21:23ff), Jesus matched wits with the ìchief priests and the elders of the people,î and put them to shame when they asked him where he obtained the authority to do what he was doing, which was teaching and healing in the temple precincts. He then told his listeners several parables, which obv iously condemned the behavior of the same leaders. ìWhen the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. They wanted to arrest him, but they feared the cr owds, because they regarded him as a prophet.î (Mt 21:45-46). The accounts of Mark (11:27ff) and Luke (20:1ff) differ only in minor details. Johnís Gospel does not record the render-unto- Caesar incident. With the precedingí accounts of the render-unto-Caesar incident in mind, letís turn to a book, which is representative of the interpretation Christendom has generally made of the incident. The title is The Whole Story , by Martin J. Healy, S.T.D., published in 1959 by the Confraternity of the Precious Blood, a religious organization of the Roman Catholic Church. It contains the NIHIL OBSTAT of Thomas W. Smiddy, S.T.L., Censor Librorum; and the IMPRIMATUR of Brian Iosephus McEntegart, D.D., LT.D., Bishop of Brooklyn, NY. The Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur are official declarations by the Catholic Church that a book or pamphlet is free of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"30 doctrinal and moral error. A foreword by the Rt. Rev. Msgr. Joseph B. Frey describes the book as an attempt to present ìthe story of man in the light of revelation.î Although it is ìwritten for the general reading public,î its interpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident mirrors vo luminous, scholarly interpretations of the incident found in so-called interpreter Bibles and Bible commentaries of both Protestant and Catholic exegetes a like. Here then is the Rev. Martin Healyís take on the render-unto-Caesar incident, which is found on pp. 426- 429 of The Whole Story . Quotations from Rev. Healyís book are indented. [Our editorial comments are in bold face within brackets] . Unable to refute the claim of Jesus to be in a unique way the Son of God, and yet unwilling to accept Him as Godís Son, His enemies then tried to bring about His downfall by making Him appear to be in conflict with the ruling Roman authorities. [They neednít make him appear to be in conflict. The principles Jesus taught (love your enemies, do unto others, judge not, etc.) are so antithetical to the tenets of the Roman state that it was doomed to fall if Jesusí philosophy ever gained ascendancy, and he was doomed to die by the Roman sword if, or rather when, a loyal Roman administrator became aware of the sedition he was preaching to a growing cadre of disciples.] They sent agents to trap him. Posing as sincere Jews, anxious to follow the law of God exactly, they asked Jesus, ìIs it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?î The question was chosen with great guile. To have answered simply either ìYesî or ìNoî would have been disastrous to the cause of Jesus."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"31 [What cause? Would Jesus be less than forthright for any cause? Jesus taught that ends cannot justify means, and that the truth shall set you free. The truth was his only cause.] The answer ìNoî would have been in accord with the sympathies of the people (though not with the sympathies of the Pharisees and Herodians who had sent these spies to ensnare Jesus, which is why Jesus called them ìhypocritesî). But if Jesus had said ìNo,î He would have appeared to the Romans as a revolutionary inciting the people to rebellion. Moreover, and this was even more opposed to the intention of Jesus Himself, he would have appeared to His own people as a Messias, anxious to precipitate a revolt and establish a political Jewish kingdom. [The inescapable, demeaning implicati on of this interpretation is Jesus was more concerned with appearances than the truth.] On the other hand, if Jesus had given in answer a simple ìYes,î then He would have forfeited the sympathies of His countrymen by seeming to favor the Roman domination over the Jews. To a people whose Messianic hopes were almost entirely political, this would have meant that Jesus was disclaiming any right to the title of Messias. [This implies Jesus avoided speaking the truth in order to curry popularity with the people. But according to the Gospel of John, Jesus readily sacrificed popularity and lost many followers by insisting, ìThose who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life.î (Jn 6:41-71) Jesus did not answer in words at once. ìShow me the coin of the tribute,î He asked. When they had brought to him a silver penny, He"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"32 asked them, ìWhose are this image and this inscription?î (Matthew XXII, 20) ìCaesarís,î they replied. Jesus then said, ìRender, therefore, to Caesar the things that are Caesarís, and to God the things that are Godísî (Matthew XXII, 21) The people marveled at His answer. [The author fails to notice that Jesus did not ask the pertinent question, viz., ìWhose coin is this?î If he had, the answer would not have been ìCaesarís,î for it was not Caesarís coin. Why, then, did Jesus raise an issue irrelevant to the question whether or not to pay the tax? The solution to this conundrum is crucial to understanding the character of Jesus and the intendment of his answer.] In replying to the question Jesus said ìYes,î but in such a way that both the rights of God and the consciences of the people were protected. [This commentary is preposterous. How were the consciences of the people protected by hiding the truth from them? And why would their consciences need protection? From what danger? Jesus was the one in danger. He was the one they were trying to trap. Furthermore, he spent his ministry jarring consciences, not protecting them. As for protecting the rights of God, God is the Almighty; His rights need no protection.] In effect Jesus said it is lawful to obey an existing government (even when the government is unpopular) when that government is levying taxes to insure the public order and peace. [Where did this come from? It is plainly a giant leap from speculation to conclusion based solely on a statist mind set! (Note: Our definition"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"33 of statism, extracted from a Google definition of statist religion, is a mentality and set of beliefs inculcated by the state and meant to be upheld unquestioningly by those subject to them.) Is it lawful to obey government laws that abrogate Godís law? Godís Commandment, ìThou shall not steal,î is unequivocal. How is it possible that forcibly taking money against a personís will, such as by taxation, for any purpose, is not stealing? What attribute of government exempts its agents who collect, its bureaucrats who spend, and its dependents who receive or otherwise gain by tax revenues, from the law of God prohibiting theft? Furthermore, Rome used its tax revenues to prosecute wars of naked aggression, to slay, enslave, conquer and otherwise subjugate people. To enforce Pax Romana, Rome brutally extinguished opposition and dissent throughout its vast empire. Would Jesus support such violence by paying for it and encouraging others to do so? We think not!] It is even possible that Jesus, by asking for the coin of the tribute, a silver penny, a coin minted only by the Romans and not by the Jews, reminded his countrymen that by using this coin they recognized in fact the loss of their own independence and the legitimacy of the Roman government in fact. Thus, in paying the tax they would be only obeying a lawful authority. [What palpable nonsense! The author cannot explain how the Roman stateís de facto conquest by might of arms attained legitimacy in the eyes of God or Jesus. Mere use of an oppressorís coinage cannot legally nor logically be construed as conferring or recognizing a regimeís legitimacy. Government-minted coins proliferate only"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"34 because legal-tender laws forcibly prevent private mints from competing. If Romeís authority was lawful, then might makes right. Jesus counseled the contrary in his Sermon on the Mount and throughout his ministry, which is why he is justifiably known as the Prince of Peace and why he constituted a grave threat to Rome. The one and only reason why Jesus responded to their question with a question of his own was to allow hi s deceitful interrogators to become befuddled by their own duplicity, effectively removing the bait from their cunning trap. Let it also be noted that the government this author decrees legitimate ìin fact,î did in fact crucify Jesus, making it perhaps the most illegitimate government ever! ] But by adding, ìrender to God the things that are Godís,î Jesus safeguarded the rights of God and of the consciences of men. [Let me also repeat--Godís ìright sî do not require safeguarding, nor do menís consciences need safeguarding from the truth.] Moreover, the reply of Jesus maintained intact His own claims. By refusing to counsel rebellion agai nst Rome, Jesus showed once again that He had no desire to become a political Messias and no intention of allowing His own people to cast Him in that role. [Here the author confuses tax resistance with rebellion. Efficacious tax resistance pursuant to the Jesusí principles can only be accomplished by determined, nonviolent noncompliance with illicit tax laws, whereas rebellion usually involves violent confrontation with the forces of government. The former tends to nullify the taxing agentís authority, whereas the latter is bound to leave violent people, whether rebels or the existing state, in charge of the practice of stealing in the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"35 name of government.] This authorís interpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident is an egregious diminution of the character of Jesus. Unfortunately, it is also representative of a multitude of othersí interpretations written by exegetes of the various Christian churches. If the establishment-church scholars do not explicitly misinterpret Jesusí words as sanctioning taxation, at the minimum they assert he put his seal of approval on the state with the words ìrender unto Caesar the things which are Caesarís.î In either case the orthodox- Christian interpretations of the incident flagrantly mutilate the truth and slander the character of Jesus. The person who wrote the above interpretation of the render-unto- Caesar incident does not know Jesus as well as did his enemies, who said of him, ìWe know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou for any man; for thou regardest not the person of man.î (Mt 22:16, KJV) His adversaries were relying upon these attributes of Jesus when they fashioned their plot and concocted the question intended to ensnare him. Compared to this author, they knew the man Jesus very well. It is officious bible interpreters who evidently do not know his impeccable character."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"36 CHAPTER 4: THE CHARACTER OF JESUS The religious leaders who wanted Jesus put to death did not know the most important fact about Jesus--that he was the Messiah, anointed by God to serve as personal Savior of thos e who would embrace the truth he taught and by which he lived and died. They did not know because they refused to hear the good news he proclaimed. They were blinded by power and material prosperity and committed to defending the status quo. They literally could not afford to believe Jesus. They did, however, have good inte lligence on the man Jesus. When they sent spies to trap him in speech, they were accurate in their flattering assessment of his manly character: ìTeacher, we know that you are rght in what you say and teach, and you show deference to no one, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth.î (Lk 20:20) Knowing he possessed those attributes, they were safe in assuming Jesus would denounce Caesarís tax. They understood that taxation violates Godís commandment, ìThou shall not steal,î and they were confident Jesus would uphold Godís law and condemn such theft. They certainly knew that on previous occasions Jesus had equated collecting taxes with sinfulness. Thus, they were sure his answer would be, ìNo! Donít pay Caesarís tax!î The plot to trap Jesus should have worked, given his comprehensive knowledge of Godís law and unflinching adherence to it, the sinful nature of taxation, and his character as a man. But their plot failed because his adversaries did not comprehend theí divine nature of Jesus. It simply wasnít in them, as it is not in us, to trick, trap or fool this unique son of God. Those Bible scholars who say Jesus avoided the question, ìIs it lawful to pay the tax; should we pay it?î because he did not want to offend one"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"37 group or another, do grave injustice to his integrity. Those adversaries who tried to trap Jesus and who subsequently accused him before Pilate had a higher opinion of the character of Jesus than do the latter-day exegetes. His enemies did not take Jesus for a people pleaser, but as a courageous man of integrity who ìshowed deference to no one.î All of the accounts of the render-unto-Caesar incident make it clear that Jesus did not obfuscate, nor dissemble, nor endorse taxation, nor sanction the state, nor exonerate Caesar of theft. He did not answer their question yes or no, but his respons e boldly conveyed his position. He explicitly told them what Godís law requires, to wit--Give Caesar what belongs to Caesar. Period! No more, no less! That is the only way for one to treat anotherís property in accordance with Godís unequivocal command not to steal. And it is the only way his words can be construed. Jesus meant what he said! He did not tell them to give Davidís coin to Caesar, and no doubt the coin went back into Davidís pocket. Those who witnessed the incident knew that the coin belonged to David. It is also likely that many of the witnesses, though not necessarily all, realized that his answer constituted a resounding denunc iation of Caesarís tax. To many who were present Jesusí words conveyed thisñIf you believe your money belongs to Caesar because his face and seal are on it, then give it to him. And, by obvious infe rence, otherwise keep it. No one familiar with the attributes of circulating coins believed their money belonged to Caesar because his face and inscription were imprinted on it. Like Washingtonís face on a present-day quar ter, or Cadillacís emblem on your car, Caesarís face and inscription on Roman coins--the coin-makerís markñhad no bearing on the ownership of Roman coins. Any other"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"38 arrangement would destroy their value as a medium of exchange, which is the common, indispensable attribute of any commodity serving as money. (Would you accept coins in exchange for your goat if the goat became the property of the buyer but the coins remained the property of a third party, subject to arbitrary recall at any time?) Jesusí inquisitors may have realized he had condemned Caesarís tax exactly as they anticipated he would. If they did, however, they would also have realized that his response, remo ved from the context of the incident and repeated against him later at a trial before the Roman governor for resisting Romeís tax, might serve to exonerate rather than convict him. In other words, they worried Pilate would be confused by Jesusí response in much the same way his Christian interpreters have been bamboozled. That is why his answer so amazed and disc oncerted those who thought for sure they would trap him. It certainly helps to explain why so many church exegetes, neglecting to take the char acter of Jesus into account, have misinterpreted the incident and Jesusí answer. To lend a semblance of credence to the incredible proposition that Jesus endorsed paying taxes when he said give Caesar what is Caesarís, some church scholars resort to the absurdity mentioned above. They posit the untenable hypothesis as if it were historical fact, that Roman coins were understood to be the property of the emperor. Thus, Davidís coin was Caesarís property, not Davidís, and Caesar was only taking back what he already owned when he taxed David. Unfortunately for these commentator s, we have recourse to basic logic, monetary theory, and archaeology to refute their hypothesis. Logic tells us we would never accept money in exchange for something of value if"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"39 the money we received in the transaction belonged to a third party while what we gave became the property of the other party with no strings attached. Monetary theory (see, for example, The Theory of Money and Credit , by Ludwig von Mises, Irvington, NY, The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc., 1971) proves that it is beyond the power of any state to ensure by law, which is to say, by fo rce, the things it designates as money will in fact be employed as a common medium of exchange. Coins and currencies may be designated as money by governments, but they only become money by usage among those who engage in commerce. One absolute prerequisite to a commodity being accepted as money in exchange transactions is that the moneyís ownership must be presumptively established merely by possession. Archaeologists have found silver Roman denarii throughout what was the Roman Empire during the time of Jesus, indicating the coins circulated freely as a medium of exchange. Thus, it was understood by all that possession, not Caesarís image or superscription, conferred ownership. (See Roman Coins. from the Earliest Coins to the Fall of the Western Empire , by Harold Mattingly, London, Spinks and Sons Ltd., 1977) A short time before the render-unto-Caesar event, Jesus refused to answer another question asked of him by the Jewish leaders. The incident is recorded in Matthew, Mark and Luke. Lukeís account will suffice: One day, as he was teaching the peopl e in the temple and telling the good news, the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders and said to him, ìTell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Who is it who gave you this authority?î He answered them, ìI will also"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"40 ask you a question, and you tell me: Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?î They discussed it with one another saying, ìIf we say, ëFrom heaven,í he will say, Why did you not believe him?í But if we say, ëOf human origin,í all the people will stone us; for they are convinced t hat John was a prophet.î So they answered that they did not know where it came from. Then Jesus said to them, ìNeither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.î (Lk 20:1-8) This is an instructive episode, which provides further insight into the character of Jesus. It can also help us understand the true meaning of his answer to the subsequent question about paying Caesarís tax, and why he responded in the way he did. Jesus had already revealed that his authority to teach and heal came from God, his Father in heaven (Jn 5:25ff). Reports of his claim must have reached his interrogators. So, as in the render-unto- Caesar incident, his opponents were posing a superfluous question, thinking they knew beforehand what his answer would be. Their purpose in this instance was to prod him to publicly say he was the Messiah whose authority came from God. Unlike his disciples, the leading Jews did not believe Jesus was the Messiah. If Jesus responded as they expected, in their eyes he would be incriminating himself of blasphemy by professing a unique, personal relationship with God. Blasphemy was punishable by death under Jewish law. However, in the time of Jesus the subjugated Jews had to bow to Roman law, by which only Rome could carry out an execution. Roman law was not concerned with Jewish blasphemy. Undoubtedly, that is why the tax issue was soon thereafter chosen as more reliable bait to ìtrap him by what"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"41 he said, so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the Roman governor.î (Lk 20:20) On this occasion, as in the render-unto- Caesar incident, Jesus responded to the question with a question of his own, which had the same result. His adversaries were discomfited. Only two possible answers existed to the question of where Jesus received his authority to teach and preach. It obviously did not come from the religious authorities since they were the ones asking Jesus the question, so it either came from God or from the secular authority. The leading Jews knew full well Jesus was not licensed by Rome to preach. They fully anticipated he would tell them his authority came from God, just as they later anticipated he would answer their question on taxes by saying, No, pursuant to Godís law, you are not to pay the tax; donít pay it. Every Christian should be able to understand that if Jesus had answered either question directly, his answers in both cases would have been the answers his enemies expected from him. His enemies knew what they were doing, and they knew Jesus, the man. He did not answer them directly in either instance because in so doing he woul d have been outwitted by his foes, a turn of events that could never happen. The hallmark characteristic of Jesus was the truth. Among the four Gospel authors, John mentions this quality most often: And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory of a fatherís only son, full of grace and truth. (1:17) Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, ìIf you continue in my word, you are truly my discipl es; and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.î (8:31) Jesus said to them, ìIf you were Abrahamís children, you would be doing what Abraham did, but now"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42 you are trying to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.î (8:39-40) ìBut because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.î (8:45) ìIf I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?î (8-46) ìI am the way, and the truth, and the life.

To live, one must acquire the fruits of othersí labor. Only three methods of acquisition are possible. We can acquire resources we canít produce ourselves through voluntary exchange, as gifts, or by force, including coerci on. Variations of the latter include fraud, theft, robbery, plunder, extortion, slavery, taxation. All such aggressive means of acquisition are proscribed by Godís law, Thou shall not steal, and violate Jesusí Golden Rule, ìDo to others as you would have them do to you.î (Lk 6:31). Only the imprimatur of the state distinguishes taxation from the other forms of aggressive acquisition, which is why French economist Frederic Bastiat could coin the term ìlegal plunderî to precisely describe taxation. A law that makes taxation legal is not Godís law. Such a law violates Godís law. On the other hand, the statutes of legislatures affirming Godís law are merely pretentious and entirely redundant. Godís law is unequivocal, ìThou shall not steal.î Jesus was not duped by the sophistry required to distinguish taxation from other palpably sinful means of acquisition. On several occasions before the render-unto- Caesar incident, Jesus had openly expressed his negative regard for taxation. His attitude toward the act of tax collecting is reflected in remarks recorded in the Gospel of Matthew: For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?î (5:46) When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, ìWhy does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?î But when he heard this, he said, ìThose who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick...I"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"44 have come to call not the righteous but sinners.î (9:11-13) If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone.

If the member refu ses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile, and a tax collector.î (18:15-17) Jesus said to them (viz., the chief priests and the elders of the people), ìTruly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.î (21:32) Why did Jesus repeatedly point to tax collectors as prototypical sinners? Probably because the tax collectorsí sin, theft by taxation, was perpetrated openly, committed publicly under the carnal sanction of illicit law. It was, therefore, the most conspicuous of all sins at the time of Jesus, just as it is today. Clearly, even prostitutes practice their trade with greater discretion than tax collectors. Given the destitute and still declini ng economic circumstances of poor Jews under Romeís rule, given the substantial role taxes played in their impoverishment, given the brutality of Roman tax collectors and their methods, and given Jesusí compassionate regard for the poor, the most conspicuous archetypical sinner in t he eyes of Jesus and many others was the disreputable tax collector.

Jesus knew Romeís man-made tax laws stood Godís law on its head. However, tax laws were not Romeís invention. Taxes had been collected by Egyptís pharaohs since at least 2500 BC. (See, For Good or Evil, the Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization, by Charles Adams, Lanham, MD, Madison Books, 1993, pp. 5ff) According to Adams, who is the leading authority on the history of taxes, it is likely that while the Jews were dwelling in Egypt they were reduced from affluence in Josephís time to abject poverty in the time of Moses by Egyptian tax laws specifically designed to humble, impoverish, and ultimately enslave them (see, p. 29). Long before the time of Jesus, Israel too initiated internal taxation under its first human ruler. Proof of this is found in1 Samuel 17:25: ìHe [Saul] will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his fatherís family from taxes in Israel.î ( The Holy Bible, New International Version, 1984) (Note: Until the Jews made Saul their king and lawmaker in place of God, they had not been taxed since their exodus from Egypt four- hundred years earlier.) Jesus castigated the Pharisees and lawyers for nullifying Godís law by means of human ordinances. When the Jewish leaders criticized Jesusí followers for disregarding their man-made rules, he called them hypocrites and warned that even tax collectors and prostitutes would enter heaven before they did. (Mt 15:1ff, 16:3, Lk 7:30ff, 11:39ff, 13:10ff, 14:3f) While there can be no doubt then as to exactly where Jesus stood on"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"46 the evil of collecting or receiving tax booty, the question asked by the spies of the render-unto-Caesar incident solicited his opinion as to the legality, according to Godís law, of paying taxes. Is it possible Jesus deemed it sinful to pay taxes, never mind collecting taxes, which we know he condemned? How would Jesus have answered their question if it wasnít a design to trap him? During the render-unto-Caesar incident, Jesus could and would have avoided the trap by answering: Yes, it is lawful to pay the tax, you should pay it. If Jesus believed paying taxes was in accord with Godís law, he certainly would have taken the opportunity to openly instruct his followers on the truth of the matter. If that was his position, as virtually all of the renowned Christian exegetes have procla imed ever since the amalgamation of the church and the Roman state, there was no reason for Jesus not to answer directly. On the other hand, if he had said, ìNo, taxes violate Godís law; it is wrong to collect or pay; do not pay Caesarís tax,î as his enemies wanted and expected him to say, he would have been outwitted, duped, victimized by their ploy, caught in the Phariseesí cunning trap. Instead, Jesus maintained his impeccable integrity, confounded his cunning adversaries, and yet clearly enunciated his principled stance on the issue of paying taxes, to wit, an implacable foe. Give Caesar what belongs to him, no more, no less, no tax. Only two possible positions exist on the question. In Mark the question is asked, then rephrased. ìIs it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?î (Mk 12:14) Refusing to endorse paying taxes, which he could have done without being harmed by their treachery, Jesus de facto endorsed the only other alternative in words"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"47 that ìutterly amazedî them. On another occasion under different circumstances Jesus was explicit: When they reached Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, ìDoes your teacher not pay the temple tax?î He said, ìYes, he does.î And when he came home, Jesus spoke of it first, asking, ìWhat do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their children or from others?î When Peter said, ìFrom others,î Jesus said to him, ìThen the children are free. However, so that we do not give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook; take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for you and me.î (Mt 17:24-27, NRSV, emphasis added) This incident reveals Jesusí attitude regarding taxes. It may help in the context of this essay to provide another version of the same passage. The following is from The New American Bible (New York, Catholic Press, 1970). When they entered Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and said, ìDoes your master not pay the temple tax?î ìOf course he does,î Peter replied. Then Jesus on entering the house asked, without giving him time to speak: ìWhat is your opinion, Simon? Do the kings of the world take tax or toll from their own sons, or from foreigners?î When he replied, ìFrom foreigners,î Jesus observed: ìThen their sons are exempt . But for fear of disedifying them, go to the lake, throw in a line, and take out the first fish you catch. Open its mouth and you will discover a coin worth twice the temple tax. Take it and give it to them for you and me.î (Mt 17:24-27"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"48 NAB, emphasis added) The first thing to notice about this astonishing incident is the highly unusual negative context in which the tax collector posed the question to Peter. Does your teacher NOT pay the tax? No self-respecting tax collector would ask that questionñunless he had some indication that Jesus didnít pay. If not, he would simply tell Peter to tell Je sus to pay the tax. Tax collectors donít ask if you do pay , and they most emphatically donít ask whether you do not pay. Tax collectors donít ask; they tell you to pay upñor else. Jesus chided Peter for committing him to pay a tax, which Jesus would never pay voluntarily. But since Peter had committed him, however impetuously and imprudently, it would now be even worse than paying the tax to go back on his word, as pledged by Peter, his servant/agent in the full legal sense of the master/servant-pri ncipal/agent relationship, which Jesus understood perfectly as his parables demonstrate. To do so would have scandalized Jesus, made Peter a liar, and possibly harmed the tax collector, who took Peter at his word. Jesusí principled stance on taxes may be extrapolated from this incident and the render-unto-Caesar incident, and summarized as follows: One is not to participate in any way in the evil practice of taxation, including paying taxes, unless not paying can only be accomplished by resorting to dishonesty or the use of force. It is counterproductive and compounds the evil to resort to force or lies to oppose or escape a tax. Good ends (not participating in taxation) cannot justify sinful means (lying/violence). In this case, Peter would have been made a liar. But Jesus would not condone paying a tax from the common purse. Only a miracle could save Peter from the bedeviling consequences of shooting off his mouth. Jesus graciously"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"49 afforded him one. Only willing compliance with taxation is sinful. Voluntarily submitting to theft is almost as deleterious as partaking in the booty. Both acts serve to validate and perpetuate stealing. As with prostitution, wherein it takes two to fornicate or commit adultery, one cannot commit the sin of tax collecting without a taxpayer as oneís partner, the counterpart of a prostituteís john when a tax is paid voluntarily. Prostitute and john, tax collector and taxpayerñeach one is guilty when acting voluntarily. The contradictory modern term, ìvoluntary compliance,î is an oxymoron invented by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to euphemistically describe the act of docilely submitting to theft One reason why Jesus would oppose paying a tax is because those who abjectly submit to theft by taxation are usually eager to join in the looting themselves and become tax collectors or receivers of looted benefits when an opportunity presents itself. We know some good people who are not blind to the evils of taxation, yet they partake of tax-paid amenities such as Social Security, Medicare, welfare payments, government unemployment compensation, tuition loans and grants, business subsidies or protection, and so forth, benefits requiring the state to initiate force against innocent people on behalf of the recipients. Their justification for partaking of such ill-gotten gains inevitably relies on their own current or past payment of taxes. Because their property was stolen, they feel justified in stealing. Who can doubt the aphorism, violence begets violence? Who can doubt that Jesus would condemn a variation of theft that turns victims into perpetrators with such alacrity and spreads responsibility for the violence throughout society?

Having devoted most of four chapt ers to refuting the prevailing Christian interpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident, we want to share the comments of a valued critic who makes the same case we do, only in a single economical paragraph. Paul Farah ( cab498@earthlink.net ) wrote: Here is the question: Precisely what is Caesarís, and what exactly is Godís? An Important component of a Jewís training in those days included studying Scripture and memorizing the Pentateuch. (Viz., the Torah, also called the Law, which are the first five books of the Hebrew Bible.) Jesus was learned in the Law, as were the Pharisees. But they were trying to trap him, not learn from him. If they were paying attention to what he said, their knowledge of the Bible would have told them that Jesus had condemned Caesarís tax, because as least six times Hebrew Scripture attests that the Earth is the Lordís and everything in it, the world and the people in it. If everything belongs to God, nothing is left for C aesar. (Mr. Farah substantiates his contention with five citations from the bible, and weíve added a sixth: Exodus, 9:29, Deuteronomy 10:14, 1 Samuel 2:8, Nehemiah 9:6, Psalms 24:1, Psalms 115:16.)"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"51 CHAPTER 6: GODíS LAW OR MANíS LAW, PEACE OR WAR Why was Jesus, by virtue of his principles, an anarchist opposed to government as we know it? Why was he opposed to taxes of every stripe? The answers to these questions are mo re readily understood in light of the role of God in the affairs of the Israelites as revealed in Holy Scripture. Jesus knew the Scriptures by heart, and it is likely he is the only man who ever fully understood them. We know from Lukeís account (Lk 2:42- 60) that at the age of twelve, Jesus was already engrossed and advanced in the study of Scripture. He often referred to Scripture to explain himself, and after his resurrection on the road to Emmaus, ìbeginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted (i.e., to two of his disciples) all the things about himself in all the scriptures.î(Lk 24:27, and see, Mt 21:42, 22:29, 26:54, Lk 4:21, 32, 45; Jn 5:39; 7:38; and 10:35) Scripture records that from the time the descendants of Jacob escaped subjugation under Pharaoh in Egypt until Samuel appointed Saul king of Israel, a period of four-hundred years, the only lawmaker the Jews recognized was God. This fact is mentioned in the Book of Judges. ìThen the Israelites said to Gideon, ëRule over us, you and your son and your grandson also: for you have delivered us out of the hand of Median.í Gideon said to them, ëI will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you: the Lord will rule over you.íî (Jg 8:22-23) And again, ìIn those days there was no king in Israel, all the people did what was right in their own eyes.î (Jg 21:25) As Thomas Paine pointed out in Common Sense , Gideon did not decline to rule but rather affirmed the fact that the Israelites had no right or authority to make him or any other man their lawmaker in place of God. (See, Selected Writings of Thomas Paine (New York, Everybodyís"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"52 Vacation Publishing, Richard Roberts, Ed. 1945) (Note: also, available on the web at, http://www.bartleby.com/ 133/2.html, , ∂ 8) The state, through its monopoly on force and violence, exponentially increases the ability of individuals to kill, maim, and enslave others. Throughout recorded history m en have used the enhanced macabre capabilities of government to slaughter their fellows, often pursuant to laws made by kings and legislatures. The number of murders committed by the state over the course of its existence is truly incomprehensible. Historian R. J. Rummel, who is the leadingñif not the only--authority on the subject, in his exhaustive statistical compilation and analysis entitled Death by Government (New Brunswick, NJ, Transaction Publishers, 1994), calculated: In total, during the first eighty-eight years of this [twentieth] century, almost 170 million ìmen, women, and children have been shot, beaten, tortured, knifed, burned, star ved, frozen, crushed, or worked to death; buried alive, drowned, hung, bombed or killed in any other of the myriad ways governments have inflicted death on unarmed, helpless citizens and foreigners. The dead could conceivably be 360 million people. It is as though our species has been devastated by a modern Black Plague. And indeed it has, but a plague of Power, not germs. (p. 9) Extrapolating from the rate of democide (viz., murders by governments) for the first 88 years of the twentieth century and applying it to the period 3000 BC to 1900 AD, Rummel concludes t hat governments may have murdered as many as 1.1 billion people or more during those earlier centuries! These figures do not include combatants k illed in wars between governments,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"53 which would add millions more to a trul y satanic total. Given manís natural inclination to live off the fruits of othersí labor rather than the sweat of his own brow, and given the willingness of some men to even kill for that purpose, it is counterproductive to a peaceful, civilized, and prosperous society to create an instrument--the stateñwhich is so efficient at murder and plunder. It is also irrational. Godís law, on the other hand, is never irrational. The account of how the Israelites went from a stateless people to a nation under a king is enlightening. It is recounted in the Bible in the First Book of Samuel: Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, and said to him, ìYou are old and your sons do not follow in your ways; appoint for us, then, a ki ng to govern us, like other nations. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, ìGive us a king to govern us.î Samuel prayed to the Lord, and the Lord said to Samuel, ìListen to the voice of the people in all they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. Just as they have done to me, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so also they are doing to you. Now then, listen to their voice, only--you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.î So Samuel reported all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king. He said, ìThese will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen; and to run before his chariots; and he will appoint for himself commanders of"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54 thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots. He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards, and give them to his courtiers. He will take one-tenth of y our grain and your vineyar ds and give it to his officers and his courtiers. He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and donkeys, and put them to his work. He will take one-tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the Lord will not answer you in that day.î But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; they said, ìNo! but we are determined to have a king over us.î (1 Sam 8:4-19) It is only reasonable to assume Jesus would be offended by manís usurpation of Godís prerogative as lawmaker just as his Father was offended in Samuelís day. Jesus would not sanction man-made laws nor the rule of men over men. He said, ìDo not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.î (Mt 5:17) It is Godís law, not manís, that he came to fulfill. Godís law does not sanction manís laws. If the principles Jesus expounded in his Sermon on the Mount are ever embraced by those who profess Christianity, the era of governments and democide will be on the road to oblivion. Godís frightening description in 1 Samuel of how a king would reign over the Israelites was realized duri ng the reigns of the subsequent kings of Israel and Judah. Even worse misfor tunes befell the Jews during those times when they were ruled by foreign kings or councils, including Romeís"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"55 emperor. A king, as lawmaker, usurps a role reserved exclusively to God for people living under His dominion. The human act of making laws is a rejection of Godís law. Todayís legislators, the successors of kings, continue manís usurpation of Godís prerogative. The one-tenth tax on the Israelites, which made them slaves in the words of 1 Samuel, is far less than most Americans pay today in taxes to their government. The illicit activity of men making laws, even with the approval of one-hundred percent of a plebiscite, is proscribed by Jesusí principles, just as it was by his Father. It is wistful thinking to refer to any nation-state as ìChristian,î whether ruled by king or legislature. The principles Jesus espoused proscribe exercising control of others by means of human legislation, because such laws are always sustained by force. Jesus would never approve such a system, an arrangement denounced by his heavenly Father. All the laws man needs to live peacefully in a modern, prosperous society are contained in the Ten Commandments. Righteous men in the role of juries and judges have the ability to interpret and apply Godís law to the most recondite circumstances in a highly complex community. With the Decalogue as the foundation, men can develop and refine continuously evolving and effective standards of social conduct and efficient procedures for justly resolving disputes, and do so without recourse to man-made statutes or statist police powers. That in essence was the methodology of the English Common Law, although it was soon enough corrupted by statutory enactments. Only God has the divine wisdom necessary to create laws that can serve for all time. More than a hint of idolatry is involved in statutory"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"56 lawmaking. It is an arrogant human presumption that kings or legislatures at a moment in time possess the wisdom to make laws capable of serving the unknowable future. That is what God did when he promulgated the timeless Decalogue, but it is beyond our abilities to emulate Godís creative wisdom. A rough equivalent of taxation, called ìtributeî in the Scriptures, was one of the early unlawful practices of the Israelites. Slavery, taxation and military conscription are forms of involuntary servitude, and are all prohibited by the commandment, Thou shall not steal. The tribute of the Jews violated Godís law and rejected his rule. It was exacted from people living in territories the Israelites conquered when they took control of the Promised Land. The covenant God made with the Israelites through Moses proclaimed: If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, that I am commanding you today, by loving the Lord your God, walking in his ways, and observing his commandments, decrees, and ordinances, then you shall live and become numerous, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess. (Deuteronomy 30:15-16) When the Israelites, with Godís assistance, did take possession of the Promised Land, they were commanded by God to drive out all the old inhabitants lest they corrupt Godís chosen people with their practices of idolatry (Exodus 23:23-33) But the temptation to live off the fruits of other menís labor was too great. We are told in the Scriptures, ìYet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.î (Joshua 17:13"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"57 KJV) The tribute the Israelites exacted from the Canaanites may have served as a model for the tax of the render-unto-Caesar incident. It is called tribute in the KJV, a tax the Jews were required to pay to their conquerors, from which Roman citizens were exempt. A taste of their own medicine so to speak, perhaps just deserts for their treatment of the Canaanites after God had rescued them from similar oppression at the hands of the Egyptians. Just as God the Father proscribed the Israelites from exacting tribute, we can be sure that the principles Jesus espoused precluded his followers from collecting or paying taxes. In doing so, Jesus was guilty of violating Roman law but upholding Godís law against stealing and his own principle of nonviolence. Not paying taxes is a crime in every state; counseling others to resist has been a capital offense under many regimes. The crucifixion of Jesus--the Messiah, t he Anointed One of God--pursuant to man-made laws ought to be sufficient cause for his followers to abstain from making laws and levying or paying taxes. The Jewish leaders could not crucify Jesus on their own authority. Romeís government reserved that God-like power over life and death to its sovereign self. So, Luke tells us, the Sanhedrin dragged Jesus before the district director of taxation for Judea (Pontius Pilate) where they accused him of ìforbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor.î (Lk 23:2) It is virtually certain that on the basis of that accusation alone the man in charge of taxes for the district of Judea was persuaded to execute Jesus. Many Christians, dependent on tax-paid government benefits to supply their wants and needs, stand shoulder to shoulder in spirit with Pilate in favor of strict enforcement of tax laws, which fund their precious benefits. And why not?"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"58 Their exegetes have told them that paying taxes is a Christian duty. And like the Pharisees before them, many Christians today cannot afford to accept Jesusí words as they pertain to taxation because adopting his principles would jeopardize their entitlements. It is, as Jesus said, ìbecause they seeing, see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.î (Mt 13:13, KJV) Government and taxes are like two sides of a coin. You canít have one without the other. The virus that infects both, and places them beyond the pale of Godís law or Jesusí sanction, is violence. Violence is an indispensable element of their respec tive natures. A tax that did not ultimately rely on government force or coercion for its collection would not be a tax. And a government that did not assert the right to enforce its edicts by initiating violence, if for no other reason than to collect taxes, would not be government as we know it. A stateís sovereignty depends on the governmentís superior force, whic h depends utterly on its tax revenues. Throughout much of the world, the institution of kings ìgoverning by divine rightî has been supplanted by democracy--rule by the people. Sovereign power in the United States is said to reside in the people, whereas in Israel in the time of Judges it resided in God. This usurpation by many rather than by one, based on the numbers alone, must constitute a greater affront to the Almighty than the singular arrogance of a lone monarch. Furthermore, people ruled by a monarch are more likely to renounce their allegiance to a king and restore the reign of God than people engaged in imperiously legislating for themselves, who may be irredeemably corrupted by their unholy power. The practice of taxation is more grievous and deeply entrenched in a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"59 democracy than under a monarchy or dictatorship. More people partake of the booty of taxation under the former. Thus, the evil is more pervasive. With the advent and unremitting augmentation of income taxation in America, and the concomitant proliferation of tax-paid benefits, many Americans have become so dependent on government and taxes, which is to say addicted to the use of force to obtain their daily bread, that withdrawal, if it is even possible, is bound to be traumatic. Our society has been likened to an unbroken circle of pickpockets, each with one hand in his neighborís pocket and his neighborís hand in his. Dependence on state violence, has become ubiquitous in Americ a. It shows in our foreign policy and our treatment of one another at home. The state and taxation can metaphorically be likened to the head and tail of a serpent, with war the fodder on which the reptile feeds. One need only look at the history of the United States to see a parallel, symbiotic growth of government, taxes, and wa rs, with a concomitant erosion of liberty. (See, Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government, by Robert Higgs, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1987) Nothing is as effective as war to justify increasing governmentís size and the level of taxation. And there is nothing like size and abundant revenues to justify war. Without taxes there could be no government, and without government there could be no wars. War and death are among the few things the state is capable of producing more efficiently and abundantly than private enterprise. Taxes, war and the state all violate Godís law violently."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"60 CHAPTER 7: JESUS CHRIST, ANARCHO-CAPITALIST In his famous 1776 treatise on economics, The Wealth of Nations (Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, Edwin Cannan, ed., 1976), Adam Smith, defending free markets, argued as follows [Our summation is in boldface inside brackets] : [An individual working for his own gain is] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intentionÖBy pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it...The statesman, who would attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capi tals, would...assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever. (p.477-78). The truth of this observation is manifest in the generally greater affluence of the people of capitalist lands versus t hose living under socialism. Central planning assumes the central planners know better and are more concerned and adept at providing for the general welfare than are other people, yet no one has ever been able to explain whence the plannersí special genius, concern and skills ar e derived.

Murdering their own citizens and foreigners and making wars of aggression are two of those things. In addition, states can pursue prohibitively expensive projects funded by taxes, which no voluntary organization could afford nor would rationally undertake. But the science of economics demonstrates conclusively that in the long run such projects are always detrimental to the general welfare of the people for whom they are purportedly undertaken. Economic analysis differs from the methodology employed by the advocates of governm ent spending. Economists weigh the hidden ìopportunity costsî of government initiatives as well as the visible expenses. Opportunity costs include the lost purchases, savings and investments that individuals would have made if the state hadnít taxed away their resources to fund its projects. When missed opportunities are factored into the costs- vs-benefits analysis of state-funded pr ojects, state-sponsored projects invariably come up losers. The reason why statists are inclined to ridicule economists, or, alternatively, hire pseudo economists to justify government spending, is because the true science of economics consistently reveals the emperor has no clothes. Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) was a brilliant scientist of the same caliber as his contemporary, physicist Albert Einstein. The state, vonMises opined, ought to protect individuals from violence and fraud and defend against foreign enemies, but that is all it should do. Anything else, he argued, interferes with the smooth operation of the market economy to the detriment of society. VonMises showed that any government action in the milieu of the market economy always results in a state of affairs worse than the one t he advocates of t he intervention sought"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"62 to remedy. To address the self-inflicted damage caused by intervention, resort to further intervention is virtually inevitable with compounding deleterious results. Inevitable, because people who wield such power are loath to admit their mistakes and rescind their bold initiatives gone awry. This is an astounding assertion. According to vonMises, all government initiatives, except those limited to protecting individual rights, are doomed to be counterproductive. Whatever government does, outside its limited sphere of securing rights, only makes matters worse. VonMises made the case for his assertion with flawless logic and seamless economic analysis. In so doing, he provides scientific proof of an elementary truth, which Jesus depicted so simply but vividly when he asked rhetorically, ìAre grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles? In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.î (Mt 7:16-17) Jesus and vonMises would certainly agree: State violence cannot produce a peaceful, abundant society. Unfortunately, in his magnum opus, Human Action (New Haven, CN, Yale University Press, 1949, Contemporary Books Edition, 1966), vonMises dismissed anarchism as impractical: Anarchism believes that education could make all people comprehend what their own interests require them to doÖThe anarchists overlook the undeniable fact that some people are either too narrow minded or too weak to adjust themselves spontaneously to the conditions of social lifeÖSociety cannot exist if the majority is not ready to hinder, by the application or threat of violent action, minorities from destroying the social orderÖGovernment is the social apparatus of compulsion and coercion. It has the monopoly of violent actionÖThe state is"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"63 essentially an institution for the preservation of peaceful inter-human relations. However, for the preservation of peace it must be prepared to crush the onslaughts of peace breakers. (p.149) In Human Action and other books, vonMises makes a persuasive case for restraint of government action. His in tellectual contributions to the cause of human freedom may be unmatched in the past one-hundred years. He has done yeoman service in the cause of liberty by debunking myriad vacuous proposals, including so-called ìChristianî reforms of market operations often recommended by churchmen. VonMises was first to scientifically prove that socialism cannot possibly work for the betterment of a society. He also pointed out to the chagrin of supporte rs of a so-called mixed economy that ìNo deviation from the unhampered market economy is thinkable without authoritarian regimentation.î Such regimentation, he also showed, produces economic and social regression VonMises description of the market economy invokes the spirit of Adam Smithís invisible hand: [Our comments are in bold inside brackets] : The market economy is the social system of the division of labor under private ownership of the means of production. Everybody acts on his own behalf; but everybodyís actions aim at the satisfaction of other peopleís needs as well as the satisfaction of his own. Everybody in acting serves his fellow citizensÖThis system is steered by the market. The market directs the individualís activities into those channels in which he best serves the wants of his fellow men. There is in the operation of the market no compulsion or coercion. [This sounds to me like the invisible hand of God at work for the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"64 benefit of people adhering to Jesusí counsel to practice nonviolence.] The stateÖdoes not interfere with the market. It employs its power to beat people into submission solely for the prevention of actions destructive to the preservation and smooth operation of the market economy. It protects the individualís life, health and property against violent or fraudulent aggression on the part of domestic gangsters and external foes. Thus the state creates and preserves the environment in which the market economy can safely operate.î ( Human Action , p. 257) Sadly, in his objection to anarchy, and thus his support of severely limited government, this noble giant erred! To borrow a Jesus metaphor, the mistake vonMises made was in thinking that a bad tree (viz., the state, with its reliance on violence), can bear good fruit (viz., the preservation of the market economy). His description of the role of the state fails to notice an obvious problem. In order to prevent or punish acts that threaten the marketís smooth operation, the state must first initiate, without provocation, force or coercion against innocent people to collect taxes to pay for the security apparatus. As one James Allen, paraphrasing Jesus, said in his profound little book, As a Man Thinketh , ìNothing comes from corn but corn, nothing from nettles but nettles.î Because the nation-state is founded upon the tenet that it may initiate the use of force to support itself, it can never secure the benevolent market economy vonMises envisions. Violenc e begets violence; it cannot serve to suppress it. Bad means cannot se rve good ends. Furthermore, history proves conclusively that limited gover nment is a notorious oxymoron. With sanctioned force at hand for crime s uppression and national defense, the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"65 temptation to use it for other ìgoodî purposes is simply too great to entrust to fallible human beings. VonMises argued, ìThe anarchists overlook the undeniable fact that some people are either too narrow minded or too weak to adjust themselves spontaneously to the conditions of social life.î On this point, vonMises is plainly wrong. It is the anarchists w ho are the realists. Precisely because men are not angels anarchists are opposed to the state. The overwhelming power of nation-states makes it possible for weak, narrow-minded people to inflict widespread violence upon countless others far beyond what they could possible do absent the deadly apparat us of an existing state at their command. Furthermore, that superior force, which is the defining attribute of a nation-state, tempts people with aggressive aspirations and violent dispositions to grasp fo r the reins of government. The most cunning and dangerous among the weak and narrow- minded are attracted to, not repelled by, the high offices of nation-states. Modern examples who merely prove an entirely predictable phenomenon include Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, Adolph Hitler, Chiang Kai-shek, Vladimir Illich Lenin, Tojo Hideki, Pol Pot, Yahya Khan and Joseph Broz Tito, to name only the worst of many, who combined to murder at least 124,736,000 of their own citizens and foreigners (not counting myriad soldiers lost in wars these thugs pr ecipitated) with the force of their respective statesí governments dur ing their administrations. (See, Death by Government , op cit, p. 8, table) In an anarchic society, these monsters might have been dangerous criminals, but they could have murdered only a few people compared to the hundreds of millions they slaughtered with the apparatus of the nation-states they ruled."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"66 Ludwig von Mises coined the wonderfully descriptive word, ìstatolatry,î to depict the practice of attributing superhuman properties to the state. Those who believe they c annot obtain the benefits of good roads and bridges, an educated public, old-age security, clean air and water, medical insurance, a safe food supply, space exploration, mass transit, fair housing, community and national security, poor relief, the just resolution of civil disputes, crime suppression and restitution, or any other benefit routinely provided by government, without t he agency of a violent state, engage in the practice of statolatry. They fail to comprehend the benevolent, all- needs-fulfilling effect of living in accord with Jesusí principles, relying on freedom and the marketplace for all of these things. Statolatry is the most common form of idolatry extant in the world today. In the eyes of a pacifist Jesus, it may well be the most reprehensible form of idolatry, because the unique char acteristic that distinguishes the state from all other associations of human beings, and from other pagan idols, is its organized violence. Dependency upon the nation-state and its inherent violence for oneís wants and needs is perhaps as far astray from the way of living prescribed by Jesus as one can possible go. His advice on how to acquire worldly goods included a promise of fulfillment. His way negates the need for the violent nation-stat e. ìStrive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness,î Jesus proclaim ed, ìand all of these things will be given to you as well.î (Mt 6:33) Are we suggesting Jesus endorsed capitalism, in the same way the orthodox exegetes assert he sanctioned government and taxes? No, not exactly, but yes, in a manner of speaking. What Jesus endorsed is nonviolence and strict adherence by individuals to Godís law. However, the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"67 only nonviolent way for individual members of society to acquire the fruits of othersí labors on which their lives depend, without resort to aggression, is through voluntary exchange in a market economy. How, then, shall we resolve the apparent conflict between the spirit of generosity and active care for ìthe leastî or our fellows, which Jesus urged upon us, with the fiercely competitive, self-seeking aspects of capitalism? In the first place, the compar ison is onerous because Jesus did not urge his principles on mankind for the betterment of society; he urged them on individuals for the salvation of their souls, which is why he is called Savior. Society clearly benefits when some individuals practice nonviolence and exhibit love and care for their fellows, but that is merely a benevolent side effect of their adherence to the wisdom of Jesus for the good of oneís soul. If all members of society conformed to Jesusí principles, the market economy would undoubtedly be profoundly impacted, but it would not change its nature. It would remain a market economy, beneficial to society just as the Jesus-principles are beneficial to an individualís eternal soul. Moreover, in the absence of the dangerous prerogative of the state to initiate force, capitalism is the only imaginable societal arrangement. It thrives on the absence of force. All of the other social formulations that have been concocted require the initiation of force at some point for their implementation, which is why they donít work well and why Jesusí principles condemn them. In the second place, capitalism often extravagantly rewards, with profits, entrepreneurs who best fulfill the demands of the market. But by the same token, it simultaneously benefits consumers, who acquire the most desirable products and services at the lo west possible prices as a result of"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"68 the entrepreneursí genius, risk taking and effort. The cumulative advantage to consumers is invariably exponentially greater than the profit realized by the entrepreneur responsible for the i nnovation. The work of entrepreneurs lowers the total cost to society of all goods and services, leaving more money in the hands of consumers, which they can then use for other purposes, charitable or frivolous. ìCu tthroatî competition by capitalismís entrepreneurs bestows great benefits upon society as a whole, especially its poorest members. Another indispensable feature of cutthroat competition is regulation. The free market is far more efficient at regulating entrepreneurs and capitalist than the government. Government regulators often become corrupt simply because their authority and their emoluments are predicated on the state and its violence. Like other nettles, state regulators reproduce only nettles. Finally, the comparison is onerous because the market economy is neither moral nor immoral. Like a hammer or mathematics or nuclear fusion, it is a tool individuals can use for good or evil. However, because the market economy is the only alternative to a command economy, and since command economies require the initiation of force, the free market is clearly the moral choice. The way in which the market economy operates, as elucidated by Ludwig von Mises in Human Action , appears as though it is under the influence of Divine Providence. The market directs the individualís activities into those channels in which he best serves the wants of his fellow men. There is in the operation of the market no compulsion or coercion...Each man is free; nobody is subject to a despot. Of his own accord the individual"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"69 integrates himself into the cooperative system. The market directs him and reveals to him in what way he can best promote his own welfare as well as that of other people. The market is supreme. The market alone puts the whole social system in order and provides it with sense and meaning. (P. 257) Thus, a person not guided by the selfless principles advocated by Jesus is nevertheless directed into the service of others by his own self-interest in a market economy. In the same way a human social system is efficaciously ordered by free markets, so the planets, stars and galaxies of the universe are controlled by laws incompletely comprehended by manís limited knowledge. Although men may learn to comprehend them, such laws are not of human origin. The unwritten laws that give order to the operation of the market economy without the aid or hindrance of human laws are not unlike those laws that order the universe. They are all the handiwork of an Almighty Legislator, who is the author of the Decalogue as well as the law of marginal utility, Greshamís law, and the law of gravity. Those who fear multi-national corporations, business monopolies, and commodity cartels would proliferate at the expense of individuals in a capitalist economy without state regul ation, overlook the fact that corporations are government-created entities. Without government, no corporation nor similar legal fiction can exist. Regarding monopolies and cartels, vonMises explained: The important place that cartels occupy in our time is an outcome of the interventionist policies adopted by the governments of all countries. The monopoly problem mankind has to face today is not an outgrowth of the operation of the market economy. It is a product"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"70 of the purposive action on the part of governments. It is not one of the evils inherent in capitalism, as the demagogues trumpet.

The reason Jesus did not directly respond to the question, ìShould we pay the tax or not?î by saying, ìNo, donít pay it!î was because in teaching his principles he had already in essence told his disciples not to pay, and restating his position on this occasion would only have been redundant. And, it would have resulted in Jesus being duped by his enemies and falling into their trap, a stat e of affairs that simply could not happen. So when he responded, ìRender therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesarísî (KJV), he stated emphatically that Caesar, qua tax collector, was entitled to nothing more nor less than that which belonged to Caesar, which is to say, nothing belonging to others. His position on the issue was entirely unbiased, fair to Caesar and everyone else on the face of the earth. Neither the coin in question nor any money coerced for the payment of taxes belongs to the state. T he most sophisticated sophistry ever contrived could not fool Jesus into believing tax collectors only take what already belongs to the state. The statement, Give to Caesar what is Caesarís, is a plain statement of tr uth regarding the righteous treatment of other-peopleís property, including the emperorís. The truth of the statement is plainly self-evident. It defies challenge and precludes interpretation. We have supported our case with the conclusive words Jesus spoke regarding taxation on other occasions, and by additional logical assumptions based on his characte r and the principles he espoused as recorded in the Gospels. So far we have presented the position of only one"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"72 orthodox author. We will now provide t he interpretations of the render-unto- Caesar incident by other Christian scholars. Their arguments on behalf of the proposition that Jesus put his stamp of approval on Caesarís tax and Romeís oppressive government with his words, ìrender unto Caesar the things that are Caesarís,î often seem so blatantly contrived and farfetched that they effectively disprove themselves, which of course serves to make our point. Nevertheless, these false interpretations of Jesusí plain-spoken words have survived for many centurie s and are still being spoken as if they were true on a daily basis in the sermons of Christian ministers around the world. In the following analysis, the interpretations of the exegetes are indented. [Our editorial comments are in bold face inside brackets.] Matthew Henryís Commentary on the Whole Bible (London, Hendrickson Publishers, Vol.11, pp 256-259, commenting on Mt 22:15-22, and at pp 641-42, commenting on Lk 20:9-40, first published circa 1706): The design was to bring him into such a dilemma that he must make himself liable to the displeasure either of the Jewish multitude or of the Roman magistrates; let him ta ke which side of the question he will, he shall run himself into a praem unire; and so they will gain their point, and make his own tongue to fall upon him...If he should countenance the paying of tribute, the Pharisees would incense the people against him; if he should discountenance or disallow it, the Herodians would incense the government against him. [At this point in his commentary Henry is interpreting Matthewís account of the incident. His analysis ignores illuminating commentary contained in Lukeís account. Neither Matthew nor Mark explains the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"73 intent of the Phariseeís trap, but Luke is very clear about it. It was designed, Luke says, ìto trap him by what he said, so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.î Henryís proposition that if Jesus endorsed the tax it would incense the people against him has no foundation in the Gospels. Furthermore, it contradicts the interrogatorsí own proclamation that Jesus ìshowed deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality.î The author, however, at another point, confirms that the interrogatorsí flattering remarks are right on target, and he enlarges upon them, saying of Jesus:] That he was a bold Reprover. In preaching he cared not for any; he valued no manís frowns or smiles, he did not court, he did not dread, either the great or the many, for he regarded not the person of man. In his evangelical judgment he did not know faces; that Lion of the tribe of Judah, turned not away from any (Prov. 30:30), turned not a step from the truth, nor from his work, for fear of the most formidable. He reproved with equity (Isa. 11:4), and never with partiality [If this description of Jesusí character is accurate, and we believe it is, why would Jesus care what the masses would think of him if he stated an unpleasant truth regarding whether it was in accord with Godís law to pay the tax? Obviously, he did not care. Nor did he fear the Roman authorities as he would later demonstrate. But at this time under the circumstances of spies attempting to trick him in order to ìtrapî him, he would not say, ìNo, donít pay the tax.î If he had, he would have been duped by the Pharisees and falle n into their trap, which wasnít about to happen. Instead Jesus to ld all who were present to give"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"74 Caesar what belonged to Caesar, which did not include Davidís coin nor, we can say without fear of contradiction, anything else owned by those in attendance. In words so straight forward they confounded his deceitful enemies at the time, and his present-day interpreters later, Jesus said, give Caesar nothing, yet his words foiled their trap.] Now the question was, Whether it was lawful to pay the taxes voluntarily, or, Whether they should not insist upon the ancient liberty of their nation, and rather suffer themselves to be distrained upon? [This definitely is not the question r ecorded in any of the Gospels. It is, however, a fair depiction of the choice most people face when confronted with a tax. Distrain means to take someoneís property by legal means, which is to say by force, and can include jailing a tax delinquent until he or she coughs up sufficient funds to pay the tax. Any ìancient libertyî relative to paying their taxes, which the Jews may have enjoyed when their nation was independent, was lost to Roman conquest. Under Romeís rule, evasion of the most arbitrary tax could result in the precipitous loss of oneís property and even oneís life, as in the case of Jesus. Jews enjoyed no liberty whatsoever in the matter of paying Roman taxes. In America today, vigorous tax resistance can still get you killed. (Do a Google search on the Internet for accounts of the life and death of Gordon Kahl.) However, most taxes are paid without resistance long before distraint comes into play. And how, according to this author, did Jesus avoid their trap?] He evaded it; his convicting them of hypocrisy might have served for an answerÖbut our Lord gave a full answer to their questionÖso as to lay down a rule for his church in this matter, and yet to avoid giving"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"75 offense, and to break the snare. [The enemies of Jesus believed he would speak the truth without concern whether it might offend someone.

Jesus?] The coinage of money has always been looked upon as a branch of the prerogative, a flower of the crown, a royalty belonging to the sovereign powers; and the admitting of that as the good and lawful money of a country is an implicit submission to those powers, and an owning of them in money matters. How happy is our constitution, and how happy we, who live in a nation [viz., England] where, though the image and the superscription be the sovereignís, the property is the subjectís, under the protection of the laws, and what we have we can call our own. [The author cleverly exempts his own country from the effects of his fictional monetary theory, which holds that circulating coins belong to the state and the use of such coin s constitutes an act of submission and recognition of the legitimacy of the regime and its taxes. We have coined a new wordñ theorytale ñto describe such fantastic illusions masquerading as economic theories .] Christ asked them, Whose image is this?

First, That the Christian religion is no enemy to civil government, but a friend to it...The higher powers, entrusted with the public welfareÖare entitled, in consideration thereof, to a just proportion of the public wealth, and the revenue of the nationÖand it is doubtless a greater sin to cheat the government t han to cheat a private person. [All that from ìrender unto Caesar.î Notice the author employs a sophism to justify taxation, which, if true, negates the concept of private property, which is recognized in two of Godís laws: Thou shall not steal, and, Thou shall not covet thy neighborís goods. The sophism holds that the wealth and income of individuals belong to whatever sovereign happens to possess sufficient force to inflict its authority over the territory in which an unlucky taxpayer happens to reside. What Henry deceptively refers to as ìa just proportion of the public wealth, and revenue of the nation, î is the amount the state arbitrarily confiscates from individuals. Note also that Henry refers to the state as possessing ìhigher powers.î Those who truly esteem the wisdom of Jesus ascribe all higher-than-human powers exclusively to God. Some even refer to God as their Higher Power. Henry adorns the state with superhuman (viz., divine) qualities. His philosophy is a vivid example of that form of idolatry von Mises dubbed statolatry.]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"77 [Curiously, when Henry interprets Lukeís version of the render- unto-Caesar incident, he refers to the versions of Matthew and Mark to fill in some details. Why, then, does he not refer to Luke for an important detail, which is missing from the other accounts, but clearly only by ellipsis? Luke tells us the trap was designed to ìtake hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor?î (KJV) Accordingly, there was no reason for Jesus to decline to say, yes, it is lawful to pay the tax, and/or, yes, you should pay it, if that was his true belief. It is expressly stated by Luke, and implicit in Mark and Matthew, that his adversaries meant to use his words to paint him as an illegal-tax protester before the Roman procurator. If Jesus had said, yes, you should pay the tax, rather than crucifying him, Pilate would have thanked him for supporting the emperorís tax and perhaps given him a medal or good-taxpayer badge. Here is how Henry tries to extricate himself from the trap Lukeís Gospel sprung on him]: Their pride and covetousness made them loath to pay taxes, and then they would have it a question of whether it was lawful or no. [People are loath to pay taxes becau se they feel they can put their hard-earned wealth to better use for their own welfare or that of others, and because taxes are taken from them by force or coercion. Their loathing stems from an innate sense of the blatant injustice involved.] Now if Christ should say that it wa s lawful the people would take it ill, for they expected that he who set up to be the Messiah should in the first place free them from the Roman yoke, and stand by them in denying tribute to Caesar. But if he should say that it was not lawful,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"78 as they expected he would (for if he had not been of that mind they thought he could not have been so much the darling of the people as he was), then they should have something to accuse him to the governor, which was what they wanted.

The Bible Knowledge Commentary, An Exposition of the Scriptures by the Dallas Seminary Faculty. Edited by John F. Walvoord and Roy B. Zuck (Chariot Victor Publishing, 1983): Their question was, Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Their cleverly devised question appeared to have no clear cut answer.

The Pharisees already considered him their worst enemy. Jesus had often demonstrated he cared not one jot or one tittle about their approbation or condemnation. Why, then, would Jesus pander to anyone who might have been present?] If, however, He said taxes should not be paid to Rome, He could be accused of being a rebel who opposed the authority of Rome and the authorities would be against him. [Here yet another author neglects to check the Gospel of Luke, where he would learn that the question w as designed to elicit the answer, no, so Jesus could be charged before Pilate with forbidding payment of the tax. Those who sought to destroy him never even considered that Jesus would say, yes, pay the tax, because the oft-stated principles he advocated forbade paying taxes. All who had heard him convey his principles would know he opposed taxes. The Pharisees knew Jesusí principles, and they knew he was not a liar, nor a hypocrite, nor a mealy-mouthed panderer afraid to speak his mind.] Jesus was aware of the hypocrisy of their approach and also of the implications of His answer. He therefore answered their question by demonstrating that government does have a rightful place in everyoneís life and that one can be in subjection to government and God at the same time. [In his Sermon on the Mount (Mt 6:24), Jesus said, ìNo man can serve two masters.î] He asked them to give him a coin used to pay the tax. A Roman denarius, with its image of Caesar, the Roman emperor, made it obvious they were under Roman authority and taxation. (One coin"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"80 inscription reads, ìTiberius Caesar Augustus, son of the Divine Augustus.î) Therefore the taxes must be paid: Give to Caesar what is Caesarís. (vol II, pp 71- 72, 161-162, 255-256) [Since Caesar claimed to be divine, Godís first Commandment precludes having anything to do with C aesar or his idolatrous regime, least of all paying tribute to it or him. Only someone who cannot conceive of life without the state could adopt such stilted reasoning, or rather lack of reasoning, and come to such a warped conclusion. Jesus, of course, concluded otherwise.] The tediously reiterated monetary theorytale, which posits that the face on the coins in your pocket determines whose vassal you are, exists only in the minds of church scholars trying to explain away Jesusí opposition to taxation. In any case, it sounds like it was concocted by the same people who devised the theorytale of the ìdivine right of kingsî to rule their domains. In fact, ìyour money and your homage, or your life,î is the only truth that has ever supported such theorytales. Aside from the interpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident we propose, there is only one other possible interpretation of the intendment of the actions and words of Jesus during the incident that isnít silly on its face. Because of the blasphemous inscripti on on the denarius (ìSon of the Divine Augustusî), which purportedly (viz., according to some exegetes) was required in payment of the emperorís tax, Jesus and his followers would have disdained to even touch the coin, much less use it to pay the emperorís tax. Thus, when he asked to see the coin used for the tax, it could only have been produced by one of the Pharisees or Herodians. Without handling the coin, Jesus asked his adversaries whose face and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"81 inscription were on it? When they said ìCaesarís,î in effect he told them that, since they were in possession of the coin and aware of its idolatrous inscription referring to a mere mortal as divine, they should give the coin to their false god, particularly if they were naive enough to believe their coins really belonged to Caesar anyway. Having been reassured by Jesus that they were exempt under Godís law from paying Caesarís tax, his disciples knew Jesus was not talking to them, but only to those interrogators who possessed Caesarís idolatrous coin. This explanation makes far more sense than the incongruous hypotheses of most orthodox-church exegetes. The hypothesis, however, has a fatal flaw. It is logically incredible that only one specific coin would be acceptable in payment of a tax. If something of equal or greater value was tendered in lieu of the designated coin, no profit- minded tax collector would be dumb enough to refuse it. The Expositorís Bible Commentary , (Grand Rapids, MI, Zondervan Publishing Corp. 1981) The trap, then, put Jesus into the position where he would either alienate a major part of the population or else lay himself open to a charge of treason...Superficially Je susí answer accords with Jewish teaching that men ought to pay taxes to their foreign overlords, since the great, even the pagan great, owe their position to God.

They did not consider how a positive answer would impact opponents of the tax.

Specific comments by Paul in his Letter to the Romans, and comments by Peter in The First Letter of Peter cannot be ignored. Indeed, the pertinent words of the two saints undoubtedly and unfortunately may have influenced most of those who have misinterpreted Jesus on the issues of taxation and the state. Here is what Paul purportedly said in his epistle to a budding Christian community taking shape in Rome. According to many scholars, this letter was written in 58 AD from Corinth before Paulís eventual journey to Rome. Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God and those authorities who exist have been instituted by God. Therefore, whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad. Do you wish to have no fear of the authority? Then do what is good and you will receive its approval, for it is Godís servant for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for the authority does not bear the sword in vain! It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath, but also because of conscienc e. For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are Godís servants, busy with this very thing. Pay to all what is due them--taxes to whom taxes are due,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"93 respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due. (Romans 13:1-7) It is generally thought that Peterís First Letter (1 Peter) was written by him at Babylon in the year 63 AD. It was addressed to Christians throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. For the Lordís sake accept the authority of every human institution, whether of the emperor as supreme, or of governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right. For it is Godís will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of the foolish. As servants of God, live as free people, yet do not use your freedom as a pretext for evil. Honor everyone. Love the family of believers. Fear God. Honor the emperor. Slaves, accept the authority of your masters with all deference, not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh. (1 Peter 2:13-18) For the purpose of this treatise, we shall assume these passages are, in fact, the authentic words of their purported authors. In which case, note that neither Peter nor Paul cite Jesus as their authority for the position they seem to take in these epistles. The texts are, however, so singularly contrary to principles Jesus embr aced that the proposition that these passages were not written by Peter or Paul, but rather inserted by a translator or transcriber with a Roman axe to grind after the Christian church became enthralled to Rome, cannot be ruled out. In The Journal of New Testament Studies , Vol.11 (1964), p. 365-374, in an article entitled ìRomans 13:1-7, An Interpolation,î author John Kallas argued just such a theory regarding Paulís admonitions in Romans 13.

That failure of the world to end forced the chur ch to the conclusion that perhaps the world order--since it had not ceased--was not demonic as had earlier been supposed and was therefore to be obeyed. The editors of the respected The New Oxford Annotated Bible (New York, Oxford University Press,, Michael D. Coogan, Ed., 3 rd edition,2001), have their own problem with Romans 13:1-7. Here are two of their editorial notations: Sometimes read as Paulís `theology of the state,í these verses stand in tension with his view elsewhere of the `rulers of this age,í and his own willingness to suffer punishment from civil authorities.

This is at least one explanation for the notorious exhortation to be ìsubject to the governing authoritiesî. (Editors Introduction to Romans, p. 242 New Testament) We find Kalasí analysis more compelli ng than that of the Oxford editors. Nevertheless, we proceed here on the basis that Paul did write Romans 13:1-7, with the proviso that nothing Paul or Peter may have said can negate the principles Jesus espoused. While the comments of the saints in these two passages do not purport to explain the words and actions of Jesus on the occasion of the render-unto-Caesar incident, the authors were devoted disciples who would not knowingly eviscerate principles proclaimed true by Jesus, as they appear to do in these passages. (Note: More than a few critics of Paul have argued that he did eviscerate the words and works of Jesus, but we neednít examine that debate in this essay.) Because of the prestige of the two revered saints, and because these pa ssages are in the Bible, their comments regarding taxes and the state deserve our thoughtful consideration. Nevertheless, in the final analysis, the principles of Jesus should always prevail among his disciples. Peter was one of twelve apostles personally chosen by Jesus (Mt 4:19). He was close to Jesus throughout Jesusí ministry and was the first person to realize Jesus was the long-awaited Jewish Messiah (Mt 16:16, Mk 8:29, Lk 9:20, Jn 6:). From a safe distance, Peter watched as Jesus was"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"96 brought by guards before the high priest after he had been arrested, although he fled the scene before Jesus was taken to Pilate and tried. (Mt 26:75, Lk 22:62). Peter was among those visited by Jesus after his resurrection (Mt 28:16ff, Mk 16:16ff, Lk 24:34ff, Jn 21:lf) and one of those transformed by the Holy Spirit on the occasion now celebrated as Pentecost (Acts 2:1f). After that first Pentec ost, Peter performed miracles in the name of Jesus (Acts 3:1f). His words must carry great weight, for while Jesus walked the earth Peter may have been permitted to speak for Jesus, as he did in Capernaum when he mistakenly told a tax collector that Jesus did pay taxes (Mt 17:24-7). (On the other hand, and far more likely given Peterís manifest impetuosity, he probably overstepped the bounds of his personal relationship with Jesus on that occasion.) Peterís comments in his first epistle constitute the penultimate challenge to proving a contrarian interpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident such as ours, in which Jesus is portrayed as an anarchist unambiguously opposed to taxation Paul, a Pharisee, and--significantly--a Roman citizen, was the former persecutor of members of the early Jewish-Christian sect. After his remarkable conversion experience on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:3f), Paul became the disciple who personally carried the good news of Jesus primarily to Gentiles throughout much of the Roman Empire. Paulís epistles comprise thirty percent of the New Testament. His explicit instructions on taxes in Romans 13 constitute the ultimate obstacle one confronts in trying to prove Jesus himself would never endorse theft by taxation, nor condone the state and its monopoly on legalized violence as Paul seems to do in Romans 13. We say ìseemsî because John Howard Yoder in The Politics of Jesus (Grand Rapids, MT. Eerdmans Publishing"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"97 Co., 1972) argues that Romans 13 is not the blanket endorsement of government and taxes it may appear to be. Basically, Yoderís argument is that when Paul said ìpay taxes to whom taxes are due,î he meant it in the same way Jesus meant ìgive to Caesar what is Caesarís.î If nothing is due, nothing is exactly what Jesus and Paul said should be paid. Of course taxes are never ìdue,î until someone is lawfully assessed, or confesses to owing a tax, as when Peter mistakenly acknowledged that Jesus would pay the temple tax. In a similar fashion today, a taxpayerís federal income tax is assessed and becomes due when a taxpayer creates a tax liability by signing and filing a tax return. The taxpayer becomes liable for the tax (viz., it is due) by confessing the specified amount that is owed. Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2 create a problem even for those statists who support the proposition that Jesus endorsed taxation and a role for the state when he said, ìrender, therefore, unto Caesar the things which are Caesarís.î (KJV) Here, for example, is a comment from the Interpreterís Bible (Nashville, TN, Abingdon Press, 1954) : ìThose who contend for the ëdivine rightí of existing instituti ons have always found their strongest support in Ch. 13, and it could reasonably be claimed that no part of Scripture has afforded such solace to unscrupulous men.î If colonial Americans who thought of themselves as Christians, which would include most of the Founding Fathers, had heeded the counsel of Paul in Romans 13, the new American nation would have died aborning, and the Declaration of Independence would have been denounced as blasphemy. Slavery, which many people fought to abolish on religious grounds--but which Christian America embraced in its Constitution--might well have persisted throughout the Western world if Peterís words were"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"98 heeded. While these observations onl y support our thesis tangentially, we mention them because they reveal t he weakness of the authority of Peter and Paulís comments regarding the legitimacy of government. Christians have ignored the pertinent comments while overthrowing governments, and, more often, brandished them on high when defending existing states. It is reasonable to argue that Peter and Paul failed to comprehend Jesus on the issue of taxes and the state if it can be shown they failed to understand him on other important issues . One of the obvious and better- known errors in interpreting Jesus, which was committed by Peter and Paul and by virtually all of their contempor ary brethren, concerns the timing of Jesusí second coming. Most of his followers, including Peter and Paul, believed Jesus had said the Parousia would occur within their lifetime. In Paulís First Letter to the Corinthians he said, ìSo that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.î (1 Corinthians 1:7-8) Peter urged his contemporaries, ìTherefore prepare your minds for action; discipline yourselves; set all your hope on the grac e that Jesus Christ will bring you when he is revealed.î (1 Pet 1:13) And, again, ìBut the day of the Lord will come like a thiefÖwhat sort of person ought you to be waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of G od...Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting for these thingsÖî (2 Pet 3:10-14) Peter and Paul obviously misunderstood Jesus on this matter. Today we know Jesus could not have meant he would be returning triumphantly in the flesh within the lifetime of his listeners when he reportedly uttered words to that effect. (See, Mt 16:27-28, Mk 8:38, Lk 9:26-27) Of course we have"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"99 the advantage of twenty-twenty hinds ight and the passage of 2000 years without any evidence that Jesus has physically returned. The point is, if Peter and Paul misinterpreted Jesus on the timing of his return, they could have similarly misunderstood him on the issues of taxes and the illegitimacy of Roman civil authority. Peter often misunderstood Jesus to the point of vexation. Jesus was miffed when Peter presumptuously committed Jesus to pay the temple tax. On that occasion, recorded in Matthew 17, Peter exhibited knee-jerk obeisance to civil authority, just as he does in 1 Peter. Unfortunately, Jesus was no longer around to chastise him for evincing a misguided reverence of civil authority when Peter was writing his first epistle. Peter misinterpreted Jesus on many other occasions. When Jesus first began to tell his apostles he would have to suffer and die and be raised from the dead, Peter attempted to counsel against such a course, and Jesus severely rebuked him for doing so. (Mt 16:21-23) When Jesus told Peter that before the cock crowed twice he would deny Jesus three times, Peter ìvehementlyî professed he never would, although later he did just that. (Mk 14:30-31) When Jesus was arrested, Peter, seriously misunderstanding the pacific nature of Jesus, severed the ear of Malchus with his sword, and was again rebuked by Jesus. (Jn 18:10-11) If Peter was with Jesus during the render-unto-Caesar incident, he may well have failed to understand the Lord on that occasion too. And then there is this: [Jesus] poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter who said to him, ìLord, are you going to wash my feet?î Then Jesus answered, ìYou do not know what I am doing,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"100 but later you will understand.î Peter said to him, ìYou will never wash my feet.î Jesus answered, ìUnless I wash you, you have no share with me.î... [Jesus] said to them, ìDo you know what I have done? You call me Teacher and Lord-and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anotherís feet. For I have set an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.î (Jn 13:5-8) Now add these words of Jesus to the brew: [After serving the apostles bread and wine, Jesus] said to them, ìThe kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest; and the leader like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table, or the one who serves? But I am among you as one who serves.î (Lk 22:25-26) Jesus gave his apostles, including Peter, these explicit instructions and dramatic examples in an effort to teach them that a true leader selflessly serves his followers. The occasion was their Last Supper together. Now, contrast Jesusí instructions with Peterís and the other apostlesí behavior when Jesus was no longer with them. And the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said, ìIt is not right that we should neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables. Therefore, friends, select from among yourselves seven men of good standing, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom you may appoint to this task, while we for our part will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word.î (Acts 6:2-4)"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"101 This devolution of menial tasks by t he apostles to others, now subordinates, evidently with the approval if not at the urging of Peter, was a precursor to the rigid hierarchical structure of the church after it allied itself with Rome, and, indeed, up to the present. It vividly demonstrates that Peter failed to learn another lesson Jesus took great pains to teach him. Author Lance deHaven-Smith (about whom more will be said below) goes so far as to suggest the possibility that Peter wa s a ìfalse prophetî because he strayed from the ways of Jesus after Jesus was gone, and because the church Peter established has caused so much human suffering. (Only after it affiliated with the state, we would add.) DeHaven-Smith points to the Inquisition and the Crusades, with their wholesale slaughter of human lives, as examples of the bitter fruits that ripened in Peterís hierarchical church. Pope John Paul II did apologize for the crimes of the Catholic Church over the past two millennia, but he made no amends nor changes in the Churchís hierarchy, which is so inimical to the teaching and example set by Jesus. DeHaven-Smith undoubtedly had these words of Jesus in mind in questioning Peterís integrity: ìBeware of false prophets who come to you in sheepís clothing...you will know them by their fruits.î (Mt 7:15-16) Our own observation is that Peter was not a false prophet. Rather, he was a good but impetuous man who was prone to rash judgments, which often resulted in errors. The fact that Jesus kept Peter on as an apostle in spite of his glaring ineptitude affords comfort to those of us who slip and fall woefully short in our efforts to mimic Jesus. Paul did not know Jesus and did not become a disciple until after Jesus died. Although he was not one of the Twelve, he referred to himself as an apostle, which implies a modicu m of conceit. Because the Gospels"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"102 had not yet been written down and certainly were not universally known when Paul penned his Epistles to the Romans, he may not have realized that Jesus frequently pointed to tax collectors in general as exemplars of sinfulness merely because they collected taxes. Unlike Jesus, Paul was a Roman citizen and proud of it. In advocating the payment of taxes, he may have stumbled on his pride. ìPri de goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.î (Proverbs 16:18) Two incidents recorded in The Acts of the Apostles are revealing. The firs t took place in Philippi and the second in Jerusalem. When morning came, the magistrate sent the police, saying, ìLet those men go.î And the jailer reported the message to Paul saying, ìThe magistrates sent word to let you go; therefore come out now and go in peace.î But Paul replied, ìThey have beaten us in public, uncondemned men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and now they are going to discharge us in secret? Certainly not! Let them come and take us out themselves.î The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens; so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. (Acts 16:35- 39) And again: The tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by flogging, to find out the reason for this outcry against him. But when he had tied him up with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, ìIs it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who is uncondemned?î When the centurion heard"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"103 that, he went to the tribune and said to him, ìWhat are you about to do?

Paul obviously viewed the civil authority of Rome in a different light than did Jesus, who Rome unceremoniously crucified. Paulís Roman citizenship, whic h he brandished like a vampire-repelling amulet in times of danger, probably saved him from death at the hands of his fellow Pharisees and their Roman comrades in Jerusalem. Jesus, on the other hand, was murdered by a Roman civil servant enforcing Roman law against resisting Roman taxes, taxes that made possible the esteem Paul enjoyed as a Roman citizen. Because he was a Roman citizen, Paul was exempt from the imperial tribute tax, which literally brutalized most poor Jews, who constituted the bulk of Jesusí followers. For essentially the same reason that many Christian churches in the United States today endorse taxation, Roman citizens like Paul were likewise seduced into supporting the emperorís oppressive tax on the Jews. Paul himself, like U.S. churches, was exempt. It is easy to comprehend why Paul would misinterpret Jesus on taxes and civil government.

It is a case of what Jesus described as ìseeing, they see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.î (Mt 13:13 KJV) Today this phenomenon is called cognitive dissonance. At the inception of his ministry, Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness fasting, and there he was tempted by Satan. Here, in pertinent part, is how Luke reports what took place: Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said to him, ìTo you I will give their glory and all this authority , for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please. If you then will worship me, it will all be yours.î Jesus answered him, ìIt is written, ëWorship the Lord your God, and serve him only. (Lk 4:5- 8, emphasis added, and see, Mt 4:8- 10, Mk 1:13) Satanís claim of ownership and authority over all of the kingdoms of the world, which Jesus pointedly did not dispute, surely follows from the fact that all earthly kingdoms had then, as now, dethroned God as their lawmaker in favor of human monarchs or legislators. This passage categorically rebuts Paulís astonishi ng contention that government authority comes from God. It also trumps Peterís fawning exhortation to honor the emperor, a man whose predecessor was ultimately responsible for slaying his beloved master. How or why so many learned Bible commentators could have been led to declare that Jesus endorsed the state seems incomprehensible in light of this Lucan pericope.

Is it possible all nation states, even democracies, are Satanís domains, as the passage in Luke seems to assert? A variation of the master/servant relationship is a f undamental precept of our democratic government. Bouvierís Law Dictionary says a representative is ìone who represents or is in the place of another .î Thus, we speak of politicians, bureaucrats, and soldiers as ìour public servantsî who ìrepresent us.î But recall the previously quoted description of the master-servant relationship. (ìThe master is answerable for every such wrong of the servant as is committed by him in the course of the service.î) It logically follows that the citizens of a democracy or republic ought to be held fully accountable for any and all crimes their government serv ants commit in the course of their duties. Unfortunately, Americans do not regard themselves as personally responsible for the damaging legislativ e acts, unjust judicial decisions, unwarranted deadly military actions, merc iless executive orders, or rampant bureaucratic misdeeds of their lawful agents.

(P. 149) The point is the offending passages in Romans and 1 Peter could well have been changed or inserted in the canonical manuscripts after the Church was enthralled by its Roman-government masters, whose taxes supported both the state and its official church. It would certainly help the cause of tax collecting if non-compliance was made mortally sinful according to Christian-church doctrine.

So far, we have not found another author who interprets the render- unto-Caesar incident precisely as we do. We say Jesusí words, ìGive the emperor the things that are the emperorís,î mean precisely what they say. If his plain words must be interpreted, then the correct interpretation is this: Give the emperor nothing! Rome is evil. Taxes are evil. The tax you pay Rome produces nothing but evil. Donít pay ëem! Resist! It is hard to believe others have not found the true meaning of the words Jesus spoke during the render-unto-Caesar incident, particularly since our interpretation depends on the proposition that Jesus said what he meant and meant what he said. The fact that we are unlettered neophytes compared to the learned scholars whose works we have criticized cautions prudence but does not deter. There is a passage in Luke that explains why we are confident our interpretation is true, and was revealed to us rather than those learned bible scholars. ìAt that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, ëI thank you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because you have hidden thes e things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants, yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.íî (Lk 10:15) We have found a few Gospel interpreters whose commentaries generally support our thesis. While not minutely analyzing and interpreting the render-unto-Caesar incident exactly as we do, nor focusing narrowly on Jesusí denunciations of taxes and tax collectors as we have here, these scholars more or less agree with our conclusion that Jesus would not and did not put his imprimatur on taxes or the state. These commentators are in"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"108 close harmony with us on Jesusí attitude toward the state, although they do not cite the render-unto-Caesar incident as paramount to their conclusions. In reaching their judgment, they draw on a broad range of sources and authorities. By and large, their works are eminently more scholarly than ours. John Dominic Crossan is a highly re spected Bible scholar whose work is often cited by others. His numerous exegetical books include Who Killed Jesus (op cit), which is subtitled, ìExposing the roots of anti-semitism in the Gospel story of the death of Jesus.î One of Crossanís contentions is that the passion narrative as told in the four Gospels is not historically accurate. The apostles of Jesus deserted him upon his arrest at Gethsemane and were not witness to the narrativeís defining events--trial, crucifixion, burial, resurrection--that immediately followed. The canonical Gospel accounts of what transpired were derived from attempts by his followers to understand what happened to Jesus and what the phenomena of his life and death meant to themselves, their future, and mankind, by searching the Scriptures for understanding. As a result, Crossan argues with anthropological, sociological, and historical evidence in support of his logical assumption, that the passion narratives the canonica l Gospel writers constructed are ìprophesy historicizedî as opposed to ìhistory remembered.î Furthermore, Crossan posits, some parts of the four narratives are creative parables, composed by the authors to instruct Christians in the latter half of the first century, when the Christian sect of Jews was locked in ideological combat with mosaic Jews for adherents to their respective beliefs at the time the canonical Gospel accounts were set to writing. According to Crossan, because of these factors the popular passion narratives of Matthew, Mark,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"109 Luke, and John erroneously fixed primary blame for the crucifixion of Jesus on the Jewish leaders, whereas the historical truth is that the state of Rome, represented by Pilateís administration, was singularly responsible for the death of Jesus. Romeís responsibility for the death of Jesus does not detract from the fact that Jesus died willingly in compliance with Godís will in order to redeem mankind from sin. He did not resist Pilateís death sentence, which he could have done as readily as he av oided the Phariseesí trap. When he was arrested and Peter drew a sword to defend him, Jesus said, ìDo you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?î He could easily have thwarted Pilate, but then he wouldnít be our Savior. Should we thank Pilate for his part in our salvation? We think not, but neither do we condemn him, for condemnation of anyone is not be in accord with Jesusí principles. ìThen Jesus said [as he hung on the cross] , `Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.íî (Lk 23:34) The charge the Jewish leaders preferred against Jesus, that he had been forbidding the payment of taxes to Caesar, was factual. After the spies walked away from Jesus, undoubtedly befuddled by his render-unto- Caesar response, and reported back to the Pharisees, the well-educated chief priests probably exclaimed, ìYou buffoons! You had him! How can you fail to realize he told you not to pay the emperorís tax?î And that is exactly what they charged him with doing when they dragged him before Pilate a day or two later. Jesus was guilty of violating Roman law, and thus he was a common criminal in the judgment of the sovereign authority of the nation-state in"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"110 which he lived. The Romans killed Jesus because their illicit, man-made laws sanctioned the use of lethal force against those who refused to recognize Romeís sovereignty or who openly opposed its taxes. Living in territory under Roman rule, Jesus was doomed to die by the Roman sword whether some Jews interceded against him or not, because his principles were in conflict with Roman law. He would face the same dilemma if he lived in the United States today. According to Crossan, one bitter consequence of the Gospelsí passion narratives blaming the Jews for the death of Jesus is that they became ìthe matrix for anti-Semitism.î Crossan argues: Those first Christians were relatively powerless Jews, and compared with them the Jewish authorities represented serious and threatening power. As long as Christians were the marginalized and disenfranchised ones, su ch passion fiction about Jewish responsibility and Roman innocence did nobody much harm. But once the Roman Empire became Christian, that fiction turned lethal...If all this had stayed on the religious level, each side could have accused and denigrated the other quite safely forever. But by the fourth century, Christianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire, and with the dawn of Christian Europe, anti-Judaism moved from theological debate to lethal possibility. Think, now, of those passion-resurrection stories as heard in a predominantly Christian world. Did those stories of ours send certain people out to kill? ( Who Killed Jesus, op cit, p. xii) Crossan makes a valid point. However, the Gospelsí passion narratives arguably could not have served to ignite violent anti-Semitism if Jesusí message of nonviolence had not been egregiously distorted by the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"111 exegetesí misinterpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident. False assurances that Jesus put his imprim atur on the force- based constructs of taxation and the state clearly facilitated t he fateful affiliation of the Christian church with Rome. A church following the way of Jesus would never align itself with the state if it understood that Jesus was adamantly anti-statist. Crossan points out the fact that religi ous rhetoric only becomes lethal when it is amalgamated with the power of the state. We would point out that the state is an equally deadly force when combined with atheism or humanism, as the blood-drenched histories of the Soviet Union and communist China vividly demonstrate. The true cause of the problem is not the errant blame- placing of the Gospelsí passion narratives; it is the violent nature of the state, whether aligned with religion or actively suppressing it. A conspicuous example of a lethal mix of state and religion pre-dating any Christian anti-Semitism was Jesusí own murder. Jewish religious leaders had misinterpreted and warped Godís laws to accommodate their profitable alliance with Rome. They worried, and rightly so, that if Jesusí principles strictly upholding the law of God were accepted by the Jewish people, Rome would be obliged to crush the people and their leaders to enforce its sovereignty and ensure its revenues. They were spiritually incapacitated and thus incapable of be lieving God could or would intervene to save them if they upheld Hisí laws. They were also jealous of the peopleís embrace of Jesus and his principles. The religious leaders believed their condition of preferment would vanish if he continued. From early in his ministry, the leading Jews had wanted to kill Jesus. They were thwarted by their fear of the people, who were convinced Jesus was a prophet, and by Roman law, which reserved the subjugating power of a"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"112 ìlegalî execution to the almighty state. They needed Rome to carry out their desire to eliminate Jesus for purely selfish reasons, which they cloaked in religious fervor. Romeís motive, on the other hand, was purely pragmatic. It needed its taxes to survive. Professor Crossan, in summary of his life-long studies of the historical Jesus, states: The Kingdom of God movement was Jesusí program of empowerment for a peasantry becoming steadily more hard pressed, in the first- century Jewish homeland, through insistent taxation, attendant indebtedness, and eventual land expropriation...under Augustan peace...Jesus lived against the systemic injustice and structural evil of that situation...Jesus could have been executed for his activities at any time...( Who Killed Jesus , op cit, pp 211, 212) Crossan identifies the systemic injustice (viz., taxation), and the structural evil (viz., the state), and points out that Jesusí very life was directed against that evil dyad. It is only a small step from Crossanís analysis to our contention that Jesusí principles utterly condemned taxation and the state. Crossan no doubt would agree that it is wrong to assert, as do the orthodox exegetes, that Jesus condoned Caesarís tax or endorsed the state that crucified him. In his memoirs ( A Long Way From Tipperary , San Francisco, HarperCollins, 2000), Crossan provides a humorous interpretation of the render-unto-Caesar incident, which only misses the target as we see it by a hair: Remember the incident in which Jesus was asked to take a stand for or against Roman tribute? ìI myself,î he said, ìdo not carry Caesarís"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"113 coinage, so show me yours, and Iíll tell you where to put it.î (thatís my own [viz., Crossanís] translation). He gets it and says, ìRight, then, since this is Caesarís image, give it back to him.î He and his companions walked away holding back their laughter while the puzzled questioners argued about his answer. Was it yes or no? Did it mean that they were to pay their coins dutifully into Caesarís coffers or cast them defiantly into Caesarís face? (pp. 199-200) Another Bible commentator whose understanding of Jesusí contempt for taxes and the state comes close to our own is the great Russian novelist, Lev Nickolaevich Tolstoy (1828-1910). Tolstoy first taught himself Greek then translated the Gospels from early manuscripts and eventually produced his own consolidated Gospel. Naturally, among orthodox Christians, critics of his effort abound. Tolstoyís rendition of the incident in Matthew 17 when Simon Peter committed Jesus to pay the Temple tax refutes the interpretations of the orthodox exegetes. If we are sons of God, then we are not obligated for anything to anyone except God; we are free before everyone. We are not obligated for anything, but if taxes are demanded of you, then offer them, not because you are bound but because you must not resist evil.î ñThe Gospel According to Tolstoy , edited and translated by David Patterson, p. 110.

Tolstoy also missed the mark with his comment on evil. It is the evildoer--not evil itself--that Jesus instructed us not to resist. Tolstoy gleaned from the Gospels the facts that Jesus renounced the state and rejected the teaching authority of organized Jewish religion vested in priests, scribes, Pharisees and ìteac hers of the law.î Those who accept any Christian churchís bogus teaching authority are likely to be stuck with the overtly statist presumptions of Jesusí orthodox apologists, and their demeaning assessment of his character as a people-pleasing politician. In his introduction to The Gospel According to Tolstoy (op cit), translator and editor David Patterson says, ìTolstoy believed that the Gospel itself, in fact, rejects all earthly authority, both religious and political. Among the five rules for living laid down by Tolstoyís Jesus is the injunction to make no distinctions between one nation and another, that is, to acknowledge no kings or kingdoms.îñ(p. xxiv) Right on, brother Leo! Belatedly searching the Internet after substantially completing this essay, we discovered a few more scholars who either explicitly or implicitly contend Jesus was an anarchist.

Turning the trick question back upon the questioners, Jesus exposes their own collaboration with the Romans by asking them to show him a coinñliterally forcing their hand.

For words of encouragement on spurning these inducements to dependency, visit the following link on the Internet for a wonderful essay entitled, ìIím Spartacus:î http://www.thornwalker.com/ditch/sparacus.htm . We think improvement in oneís condition of dependency on the state should be the primary objective of committed, nonviolent voluntaryists and modern disciples of Jesus. The word voluntaryist (alternatively spelled, voluntarist) describes one who is a pacifistic anarchist. It is a useful word in the English vocabulary to distinguish nonviolent anarchists from those deluded hoodlums who refer to themselves as anarchists yet engage in violence to protest whatever it is t hey donít like about the state or about life in general. These pseudo-anarchists have hijacked the once-noble word and besmirched it bey ond rehabilitation. Other disciples of Jesus who, like us, find they cannot sever all ties to the violent state may take comfort in the Gospel story of Jesus and the chief tax collector, Zacchaeus, which is recorded in Lukeís Gospel. He entered Jericho and was passing through it. A man was there named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not see him, because he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, ìZacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.î So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him. All who saw it began to grumble and said, ìHe has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner.î Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ì"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"126 Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much. Then Jesus said to him, ìToday salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham . For the son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.î (Lk 19:1-10) Zacchaeus, a notorious sinner because he was a tax collector, was moved to repent by his brief encounter with Je sus. Jesus saw something special in Zacchaeus. It may have been the humility or audacity he demonstrated in climbing a tree just to get a glimpse of Jesus, or perhaps it was the tenacity and ingenuity of his resolve to see Jesus. More likely, Jesus knew that in his heart Zacchaeus longed for righteousness, but his work as a tax collector corrupted him. Perhaps the most important lesson th is passage teaches us is to treat tax collectors as people who can become particularly effective disciples of Jesus. One cannot go wrong pursuing peaceful tax resistance with the same patient love for tax collectors that Jesus exhibited. Relying on the wisdom of Jesus, and striving to put his principles to work in our lives, we will surely become better at resisti ng Satanís inducements to partake of governmentís enticing benefits, and at resisting taxes. After all, Zacchaeusí initial attempt at righteous living was really rather insipid, for he only gave up a job and only gave away half of his accumulated wealth, even though he had enriched himself collecting taxes. Nevertheless, Jesus approved of Zacchaeusí inaugural-if-attenuated effort to reform his character. We think he would approve of our incipient efforts as long as we are trying. Jesus concluded his Sermon on the Mount with these encouraging words:"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"127 Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rocks. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on rock.î (Mt 7:24-25) Those who heed the words of Jesus are his disciples. All knowledge of Jesus and the most steadfast belief that he is the Christ and oneís personal Savior is of no avail without adopting and living by the principles he preached and practiced. Jesus said, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesarís, no more, no less, and unto God the things that are Godís. In order to do so, surely we must renounc e the use of force in the conduct of our affairs and sever our relationship with the violent state. Complying with Jesusí principles is the truth that will set us free. French philosopher and economist, Fr ederic Bastiat, observed that freedom is an act of faith in God and in his handiwork. Voluntaryist Carl Watner, combining the wisdom of Jesus and Gandhi, made the profound observation that the faith that moves mountains is simply recognition of the truth of the Stoicís observation, ìif one takes care of the means, the ends will take care of themselves.î The way and the truth Jesus espoused can set any individual free, even from chronic government dependency. His way is paved with love and persuasion--not force. If the task of establishing a stateless society appears insurmountable, if the withering away of the stat e seems like a far-fetched utopian dream, imagine how very much harder it must have been for a man called Jesus to overcome doubt and death to achieve his resurrectionñthereby saving our souls and so very many others in the process.

It came about because a critic of this essay argued that taxes could not be sinful because neither God nor any of the prophets or authors of the Old Testament ever denounced taxes or those who levied them, which would include all of the kings of Israel and Judah from the first king to the last. In further support of his contention, the critic pointed out a passage from the Gospel of Luke in which taxation apparently meets with the tacit approval of John the Baptist, to wit: ìEven tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, ëTeacher, what should we do?í He said to them, ëCollect no more than the amount prescribed for you.íî (Lk 3:12-13) Furthermore, the critic reminded us that Jesusí praised John the Baptist with these words, ìTruly I tell you, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist.î (Mt 11:11) Essentially this same defense of taxation against the charge of sinfulness was at one time made in defense of slavery. Nowhere in the Bible is slavery condemned as sinful. It is undeniable that the kings of Israel had their slaves. In fac t, it can even be argued based on the Old Testament that God condones slavery. In a passage from Exodus (21:20- 21), God, speaking through Moses, proclaimed the following ordinance. ìWhen a slave owner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies immediately, the owner shall be punished. But if the slave survives a day or two, there is no punishment; for the slave is the ownerís property.î And in Leviticus, God tells the Israelites, again through Moses: As for the male and female slaves you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves. You may"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"130 also acquire them from the aliens residing with you, and from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property. You may keep them as possessions for your children after you, for them to inherit as property. (Lev. 25:44-46) These and many other passages, by the way, afford solid ground for not taking the Bible literally. Such passages are contrary to the explicit instructions for righteous living Jesus prescribed for his disciples in his Sermon on the Mount, and are opposed to the way he lived and died. Nevertheless, Christians relied on them to justify their part in slavery over the course of many centuries. The Apostle Peter also appears to have found the practice of slavery unexceptional and even quite acceptable. In Peterís first epistle he even seems to lend slavery his tacit support. To the exiles of the dispersion he wrote, ìSlaves, accept the authority of your masters with all deference, not only those who are kind and gentle, but also those who are harsh.î (1 Peter 2:18) Paul was even more sympathetic with the practice of slavery, lending his influential support to slave owners. To the Ephesians (6:5) he wrote, ìSlaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ, not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart.î Paul repeats this theme in his letter to the Colossians (3:21-23). In his letter to Titus (2:9-10) he advises Titus to, ìTell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to talk back, not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior.î"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"131 Thus, on the basis of the Bible, one is on much firmer ground condemning taxation than slavery. At least regarding taxes, Jesus implicitly condemned them and explicitly pointed to tax collectors as prototypical sinners. One cannot find such criticism of slavery or slavers in the Old Testament or the New. Precisely the same Bible-based argument our critic proposed in defense of taxation was raised by American slavers defending their evil practice prior to its belated abolition from ìthe land of the free.î It would be redundant to recite here the decisive arguments against slavery based on the teachings of Jesus t hat renowned abolitionists of the 18 th and 19 th centuries brought to bear against slavery and its apologists, which eventually carried the day. The same Jesus principles previously cited in condemnation of taxation apply with equal vigor to the peculiar and treacherous institution called slavery. Jesusí principles underpinned the abolitionist arguments throughout a campaign that took about a century to achieve its objective. One can only hope and pray that taxationís demise will be swifter! It is manifestly impossible for slavers to practice the Jesus principle known as the Golden Rule (ìDo to others as you would have them do to you.î--Lk 6:31), or to adhere to Jesusí principle of renouncing the use of force in the conduct of oneís human affa irs (ìPray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also.--Lk 6:27-28; and see Mt 5:38ff). Of course, what is said of slavers is equally true of tax collectors. Neither slavers nor tax colle ctors allow their respective victims to do unto them what they do to their victims. Both slavery and taxation depend completely on force and violence being embedded in and upheld by the laws of the reigning government."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"132 The closer one examines slavery from the perspective of its immorality, the more it looks like taxation--and vice versa. During the course of history, taxation has often supplanted slavery as a more effective means of exploiting subjugated peopl e. It happens because taxation is easier to impose, cheaper to adminis ter, and produces heftier returns. Fortunately, from the standpoint of slaves and taxpayers, the Jesus principles stand shoulder to shoulder with the victims, condemning both techniques of forcibly expropriating the fruits of their labors. The fact that the canonical gospels fail to record that Jesus explicitly denounced taxation or slavery does not reveal any moral weakness in his philosophy or character. What it reveals is the paucity of his chroniclersí reports as well as the inability of Ch ristian exegetes to comprehend, explain and apply the principles of right conduct Jesus prescribed. These are universal in their application, and they unequivocally forbid both taxation and slavery with equal force to those who would follow him, all of the Old Testamentís gibberish to the contrary notwithstanding. In citing John the Baptistís ambiguous advice to tax collectors and pointing out Jesusí high regard for John, our critic omitted the second half of the verse he cited in which Jesus praised John. As great as John was, Jesus qualified his praise for him by adding, ìYet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.î (Mt 11:11) As folks who are least in the kingdom of God, we have the benefit of Jesusí divine-like wisdom to help us evaluate taxes and tax collectors, which John the Baptizer had not.

Jesus did not tell Zacchaeus to ìcollect no more than the amount proscribed.î The Lordís mere presence in his house influenced Zacchaeus to resign his post as chief tax collector, give half of his wealth to the poor, and make restitution of four times any amount he stole for himself beyond what the law required him to steal for Rome. Only then did Jesus say Zacchaeus had achieved salvation. Jesu s did not tell Levi to go easy on his victims. He required him to abandon his post as a tax collector in order to follow Jesus. (See. Mt 9:9, Mk 2:14, Lk 5:27) It is logical to suppose that several or perhaps even many other tax collectors besides Levi and Zacchaeus renounced their unhol y calling in order to follow Jesus, which alone would be sufficient reason for a Roman procurator of taxes to kill him. John concludes his gospel by ack nowledging the paucity of the record setting forth Jesus prolific accomplishments. ìThis is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down, and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if every one of them were written down, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.î (21:24-25) So we ask our readers: How many miracles did Jesus perform?

The bottom line is that Christian churches in general sanctioned slavery back then ju st as most churches sanction taxation now. We have been harsh on post-Constantine Christianity throughout this essay because of the churchís allianc e with government and its embrace of taxes. The inducements offered by slaveryís evil twin are likely to continue to pervert Christianity until the sacerdotal order is replaced by disciples of Jesus. Most priests and ministers in America today are dependent on tax- deductible contributions for their daily bread, and, as they see it, for the survival of their congregations .

This Internet encyclopedia has been judged by some scholars to be as good as Britannica. Better yet, itís free! The following definitions are derived from Wiki : Malum in se (plural mala in se ) is a Latin phrase meaning wrong in itself; it is an act that is illegal from the nature of the act, i.e. it is inherently evil without any fact of its being noticed or punished; such crimes as larceny rape and murder are considered malum in se. This concept was used to develop t he various common law crimes. This term is to be distinguished from Malum prohibitum, which simply means wrongs that are prohibited, i.e., not necessarily inherently immoral or hurtful, but only wrong by statute, such as parking violations, or smuggling, or selling products without a licence, or selling prohibited products. It should be apparent to anyone that tax evasion, tax resistance, and willful failure to file a tax return, are all in the category mala prohibitum. No one, except perhaps some rapacious people who depend for their welfare on the proceeds of taxation, believes it is evil or wrong for an individual to keep the fruits of his or her own labors. Indeed, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus, instructing his disciples by parable, has his righteous protagonist in the story ask rhetorically, ìAm I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?î (Mt 20:15) In the context of the parable, the unstated answer is obvious: ìOf course you are.î Only when men enact perverse laws does benign behavior such as retaining oneís own property become a crime, in"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"136 which case the real criminals are the freedom-robbing legislators. The act of collecting a tax involves taking someoneís property without his or her consent by means of force or coercion. It is patently malum in se ñevil by its very nature. The act fits Wikipediaís definition of the crime of theft like a glove. ìIn the criminal law theft (also known as stealing) is the wrongful taking of someone else's property without that person's freely given consent.î Thus, it is self-evident that the only reason tax collectors do not go to jail for their morally repugnant behavior is because a legislature has enacted laws legalizing their plunder. However, no legislature on earth, no subterfuge nor sophistry, can transform taxation from an evil institutionña malum in se-- into something moral or beneficial. Tax evasion, on the other hand, can be malum in se or malum prohibitum. There would be nothing wrong with tax evasion if human laws did not prohibit it. However, one must be cautious here. The word evasion, according to Webster, means avoiding something by deceit or cleverness. Cleverness is not immoral, but deceit for any purpose certainly is. The federal income tax requires and depends on self-reporting, which has the effect of encouraging dishonesty among individuals who only want ìto do what [they] choose with what belongs to [them],î as Jesus so succinctly put it, but in the singular. Because of this inducement to dishonesty, Will Rogers c ould insightfully observe, ìThe income tax has made more liars out of the American people than golf has.î The only sure way for most people to remain entirely honest in relation to the income tax is to refrain from making any declarations whatsoever on a tax return. Given the incomprehensible complexity of the tax code, any declaration made under oath is likely to be false, which is why Mr. Rogers added, ìEven when"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"137 you make a tax form out on the level, you don't know when it's through if you are a crook or a martyr.î Unlike tax evasion, forthright tax resi stance, so long as it is nonviolent, is never immoral. Jesus certainly appears to have advocated resistance when, in response to the question in the Gospel of Mark whether they should pay Caesarís tax or not, he told an audience of Jews whose religion taught them that everything on earth belongs to God, ìGive Caesar what belongs to Caesar (nothing), and give God what belongs to God (everything).î Taxation has become so deeply rooted in our culture that it is unlikely that anything short of righteous, adamant resistance will dislodge it, which further explains why Jesus would have ventured to urge tax resistance. For perhaps as long as several m illennia, taxationí s apologists have engaged in cunning sophistry to make their evil institution appear, if not moral, at least necessary. Some of the more famous defenses would include Founding Father Ben Franklin, ìIn this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.î Or, Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., ìTaxes are the price we pay for civilization.î And, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, ìTaxes, after all, are dues we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.î Of course Holmes and R oosevelt were dependent on tax revenues. In making such statements they were serving their master, Uncle Sam. Moral glosses of recent vintage applied to taxation include the concept of paying oneís ìfair share,î and the oft -reiterated platitude that the only thing Americans despise more than paying taxes is ìfreeloadingî tax protesters who refuse to pay.

The Internal Revenue Service recently performed intensive, line-by-line examinations of 46,000 tax returns for the year 2001. Based on this sampling, the agency determined that American taxpayers under-reported their taxes by $345 billion for that one year! The survey (IRS National Research Program) showed that where the taxpayersí prospects of being caught were lowest, the highest rates of cheating occurred. It found fifty- seven percent of income not reported to the IRS by a third party went unreported! The only reason the number isnít closer to one-hundred percent is that most self-employed taxpayers who do submit more-or-less honest returns do so only because they fear the IRS.

What are the principles Jesus promulgated, many of which derive from traditional Jewish morality? First and foremost, he urged the love of God, which includes and requires the love of all of Godís children: ìTeacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?î He said to him, ìëYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.í This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ëYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.í On these two commands hang all the law and the prophets.î (Mt 22:36-40) One cannot love oneís neighbors and simultaneously send an IRS agent to take the fruits of their labor, by force, if necessary, to fix oneís road or pay oneís childís college tuition. In the marvelously radical Beatitudes (Mt 5:3-11) leading off his great Sermon on the Mount, Jesus instructed his followers to be meek and merciful, righteous and pure of heart, and to be peacemakers. One cannot employ a standing army and send it to do violence in foreign lands while endeavoring to live by the virtues Jesus preached. On the Mount Jesus urged his followers to observe Godís commandments, ìDo not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.î (Mt 5:17) Godís two commandments, ìThou shall not steal,î and, ìThou shall not covet thy neighborís goods,î implicitly but unequivocally proscribe taxation.

Jesus also said, ìYou have heard that it was said of ancient times, ëYou shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows that you have made to the Lord.í But I say to you, Do not swear at all...Let your word be ëYes, Yesí or ëNo, Noí; anything more than this comes from the evil one.î (Mt 5:33-37) One cannot follow the way of Jesus and sign a federal income tax return, or take an oath of office, or swear allegiance to the state, or put oneís hand upon the Bible in a court of law. Jesus said, ìDo not worry, saying, ëWhat shall we eat?í or ëWhat shall we drink?í or ëWhat shall we wear?í...Your heavenly father knows that you need all these things.

And far more than this...it constitutes a practical method for the development of the soul and for the shaping of our lives and destinies into the things we really wish them to be...The plain fact is that Jesus taught no theology whatsoever. His teaching is entirely spiritual and metaphysical...What he insisted on was a certain spirit of oneís conduct, and he was careful to teach principles only. Jesus may not have explicitly preached tax resistance or anarchy, but the spiritual principles he expounded require that we practice them. One statement in Foxís book is particularly pertinent. Either Jesus is to be taken seriously, or he is not to be taken seriously, in which case his teachings should be dropped altogether and people should cease to call themselves Christ ians. To pay lip service to his name, to say that Christianity is the divinely inspired Truth, to boast of being Christian, and then to quietly evade all the definite implications of his teaching, is hypocrisy and weakness of the most utterly fatal kind...The trouble and sorrow that humanity suffers are really due to the very fact that our mode of life is opposed to the Truth, that the things that he taught and the things that he said seem to us at first sight to be"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"143 foolish and wild. Whereas I heartily endorse Foxís Sermon on the Mount as an aid to understanding Jesus, I think he erred interpreting one of Jesusí wilder statements. Jesus said, ìYou have heard that it was said, ëAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.í But I say to you: Do not resist an evildoer. But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.î (Mt 5:38-39) Of this passage Fox says: [JesusÖconcerns] himself only with states of consciousness, with the thoughts and beliefs that men accep t: for these are the things that matter, the things that are causative. He gives no instructions for details of external conduct, and so the references here toÖturning the other cheek, are illustrative and sym bolic of mental states, and not to be taken in the narrow, literal senseÖTurning the other cheekÖwould be in the last degree unlikely to do anything but harm to both parties; and we should note particularly that Jesus, when he was struck in the room of Pilate, did not do this himself; on the contrary, he met his enemies with grave dignity. This instruction about turning the other cheek refers to the changing of oneís thoughts. I disagree with Fox. I am confident that Jesus meant exactly what he said both literally and figuratively, physically and spiritually. Furthermore, Fox is wrong about what he says happened when Jesus ìwas in the room of Pilate.î I have read and reread all four Gospels in several translations, and checked the non-canonical accounts as well. Thus, I know that when Jesus was before the chief priest prior to his trial he was slapped in the face (Mt 26:67, Mk 14:65, Lk 22:63-64, Jn 18:22-23), and before Pilate he was struck in the face and spit upon (Mt 27:30, Mk 15:19, Jn 19:3).

Fox is s peculating on how Jesus responded because the Gospels fail to report whether Jesus turned his cheek or not. I am confident that he did. For a better perspective on the wis dom of turning the other cheek, I recommend the book, I Must Speak Out by Carl Watner (San Francisco, Fox & Wilkes, 1999). It contains severa l chapters on nonviolent resistance to aggression. Watner says: I do believe that violent self-defense is a departure from the principle of non-violenceÖA person of integrity is more concerned with the means than the ends. Such a person would rather give up his own life than take the life of another. As the ancient Stoics put it, we must all die some time. It is more important how we live and deport ourselves, than whether we preserve our existence temporarily. The Biblical commandment did not say, ëThou shall not kill, except in self-defense of the family or for the common good.í A person simply has to have faith that ëif one takes care of the means, the end will take care of itself,í and let the chips fall where they may.î (p. 82-83) Jesus was a man of unblemished integrity. Even those who wanted him dead acknowledged that fact. He did indeed teach, as Fox argues, spiritual principles, and that attention to oneí s thoughts is the path to righteousness because out of oneís thoughts comes action. But literally turning the other cheek to an aggressor is a daunting challenge of both spiritual and physical dimensions.

Oh, yes, he was put to death, but only to rise from the dead and thereby fulfill his mission on earth as Savior. And he set an example of nonviolent human behavior that will live on as long as the human species survives. The most common consequence of making the commitment to turn the other cheek by adopting an attitude of non-aggressive humility in the face of violence may be that those who do so are kept safe from violence by God. According to John Hostetler in Hutterite Society (Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University. 1974), Hutterite religious communities have been around for over 400 years, and there has never been a single homicide among them. In their North-American villages there are no police forces. These benefits, it seems, are spiritual consequences of t he Hutterites consistently practicing nonviolence including abstaining from government benefits. God could and most assuredly would secure from harm any nation of people who acknowledged Him as their lawmaker, rather than a monarch or legislature relying on force to accomplish its ends, and followed through by obeying His laws. ------------ It is September 1984.

Soft sod grasps the right-front tire first, causi ng the car to swerve sharply right. Centrifugal force pulls me from behind the wheel and out through the space where a door used to be. By this time the car may have slowed from 60 to perhaps 50 or 40 miles per hour. My memory of the next few seconds is vivid regarding certain aspects of the event. I recall trying to hold on to the steering wheel, but it jerks from my grasp. I sense myself tumbli ng head over heels in somersault position. Astonishingly, I perceive rolling to a stop on my feet, my body bent over and my hands on the ground. My first thought is selfish: ìOh my God, Iím alive! Thanks!î My next thought is that my wife and child are in that wreck of a car a hundred feet in front of me. As I stumble forward, I see first my wife and than my son exit through the space where front and back left-side doors used to be. They appear uninjured, and their words confirm this marvelous fact. The drunkís car is upside down in the grass a thousand feet further down the highway. He is also uninjured. Both cars are totaled. I have a headache, many minor scrapes, cuts and bruises, and mud all over me. An emergency room cleans me up, bandages some c ontusions on my head, and sends me home. Every place on my body is sore the next day, but I am otherwise unharmed. April 1, 2001. I roll out of bed onto my knees for a perfunctory recitation of The Lordís Prayer. Then I am on my feet and on my way before I even get"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"147 to amen. My mind is racing ahead to last-minute preparations I need to make. It is Sunday and one of my brothers is coming over to relieve me of caring for our aged mother so that I can go riding. This will be my last long training ride before the mountain-bike racing season begins in earnest the following weekend. I am anxious to try out some fancy new components Iíve added to my custom racing bike over the past days and weeks. I feel strong as I begin my ride. Iíve been working out by climbing and descending progressively more flights of stairs, taking the steps two at a time while carrying thirty-six pounds of weights. I do this in the back stairwell of the 3-story apartment building where I live with mom. Iíve been doing it three or four times a week for five or six weeks now, and the effort is reflected in my riding. I will ride a 12-mile loop th is morning on trails that encompass a wide range of technical difficulty, from beginner level to several long sections demanding expert skills. I negotiate the hardest sections by dismounting and running with the bike lest I perform what is picturesquely called a face plant. The outbound leg of the loop is generally downhill, uphill on the return. One road, a one-way, three-lane thoroughfare, divides the loop into upper and lower sections. My off-road approach to crossing that avenue is down a long, steep, grassy embankment and onto the roadway at about a 45-degree angle to, and in the same direction as the traffic. The speed limit there is twenty five mph, but very few drivers adhere to it. My view to the left of approaching traffic is unhindered. There are oncoming cars in the first two lanes, but I have plenty of speed to beat them across with room to spare, although not enough that I can stop to clear the curb on the opposite side. I will jump it by lifting the front and rear wheels simultaneously, allowing the bikeís forward momentum to carry it over the low obstacle."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"148 My eyes focus on the curb until I am in the middle of the center lane, when I steal a glance to my left. A large SUV that wasnít there when I last looked has materialized in the far lane, which I am about to enter. It is moving fast, and about to occupy the same space where I will be momentarily. I swerve right and the driver of the Ford Explorer must have swerved left at the same instant, but nothing can avoid the collision. The top corner of the right-front fender strikes my left buttocks and the saddle of the bike, hurling us both forward. For a brief moment I remain upright on the bike impelled to a higher speed by the impact, and straight down the center of the lane directly in front of the speeding SUV that just hit me. I hear screeching tires, crunching metal, and an explosion of glass as I go down still clipped into my pedals. I hit the pavement, slide and roll at least once with the bike still attached to my shoe cleats. I rea lize that in a fraction of a second the SUV will run or roll over me and I will be dead. I commit my soul to God. Everything is quiet and I am lying in the middle of that third lane. My bike has finally detached from my shoes and is lying fifteen or twenty feet beyond me down the lane. I hear voices. I am not dead! I struggle to my feet and hurry to see if I can be of any help to whoever is in the SUV. It has gone over the curb that I was about to jump in the course of rolling or flipping three hundred and sixty degrees. The driver, who was alone, thank God, is exiting the demolished SUV through the passenger-side door and being helped by people who stopped to assist. He was wearing his seat belt and is uninjured--nary a scratch. I have road burns on my elbows, knees and shins, a sore left shoulder, some sore left ribs that are obviously cracked, and a severely lacerated left buttocks.

I refuse the repeated offer of the emergency-rescue personnel to transport me to a hospital. Miraculously, I am able to ride my bike--very slowly--the five miles back to my apartment. The following Sunday I participate in the season- opening, cross-country mountain-bike race, although I finish dead last for favoring my injuries. The SUV is totaled. My bike, into which I had just poured over $900 in new parts and upgraded equipment for the 2001 racing season, has minor damage to a saddle I acquired on close out for $15, plus a few small chips and scratches on the frameís new paint. I canít prove it, but I think God spared me on these two occasions so that I could complete this essay, and, possibly, so that I could continue to care for my mother. Mom has passed away now, so Iíve been a bit hesitant to finish and publish this work.
