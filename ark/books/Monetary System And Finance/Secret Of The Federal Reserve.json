A nat ive Virginian, he was educated at Washington and Lee University, New York University, Ohio University, the University of North Dakota, the Esc uelas des Bellas Artes, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, and the Institute of Con temporary Arts, Washington, D.C. The original book, published under the title Mullins On The Federal Reserve, was commissioned by the poet Ezra Pound in 1948. Ezra P ound was a political prisoner for thirteen and a half years at St. Eliza beth’s Hospital, Washington, D.C. (a Federal institution for the insane). His release was accomplished largely through the efforts of Mr. Mullins. The research at the Library of Congress was directe d and reviewed daily by George Stimpson, founder of the National Press Club in Washington, whom The New York Times on September 28, 1952 called, \"A highly regarded re ference source in the capitol. Government officials, Congre ssmen, and reporters went to him for information on any subject.\" Published in 1952 by Kasper and Horton, New York, t he original book was the first nationally-circulated revelation of the secre t meetings of the international bankers at Jekyll Island, Georgia, 1907-1910, at wh ich place the draft of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was written. During the intervening years, the author continued to gather new and more startling information about the backgrounds of the people who direct the Federal Reserve policies. New information gathered over the years from hundreds of newspapers, periodicals, and books give corroborati ng insight into the connections of the international banking houses.* While researching this material, Eustace Mullins wa s on the staff of the Library of Congress. Mullins later was a consultant on highway finance for the American Petroleum Institute, consultant on hotel developmen t for Institutions Magazine, and editorial director for the Chicago Motor Club’s four publications. __________________________ * The London Acceptance Council is limited to seven teen international banking houses authorized by the Bank of England to handle foreign exchange. @The above facsimile is reproduced from page 60 of \"HISTORICAL BEGINNINGS . . . .

(a Federal i nstitution for the insane), Dr. Pound asked me if I had ever heard of the Feder al Reserve System. I replied that I had not, as of the age of 25. He the n showed me a ten dollar bill marked \"Federal Reserve Note\" and asked me if I wou ld do some research at the Library of Congress on the Federal Reserve S ystem which had issued this bill. Pound was unable to go to the Library hi mself, as he was being held without trial as a political prisoner by the United States government. After he was denied broadcasting time in the U.S., Dr. Po und broadcast from Italy in an effort to persuade people of the United State s not to enter World War II. Franklin D. Roosevelt had personally ordered Po und’s indictment, spurred by the demands of his three personal assist ants, Harry Dexter White, Lauchlin Currie, and Alger Hiss, all of whom were subsequently identified as being connected with Communist espion age. I had no interest in money or banking as a subject, because I was working on a novel. Pound offered to supplement my income by t en dollars a week for a few weeks. My initial research revealed evidence of an international banking group which had secretly planned the writing of the Federal Reserve Act and Congress’ enactment of the plan into law. These fin dings confirmed what Pound had long suspected. He said, \"You must work o n it as a detective story.\" I was fortunate in having my research at th e Library of Congress directed by a prominent scholar, George Stimpson, f ounder of the National Press Club, who was described by The New York Times of September 28, 1952: \"Beloved by Washington newspapermen as ‘our w alking Library of Congress’, Mr. Stimpson was a highly regarded refer ence source in the Capitol. Government officials, Congressmen and repo rters went to him for information on any subject.\" I did research four hours each day at the Library o f Congress, and went to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in the afternoon. Pound an d I went over the previous day’s notes. I then had dinner with George Stimpson at Scholl’s Cafeteria while he went over my material, and I then went bac k to my room to type up the corrected notes. Both Stimpson and Pound made m any suggestions in guiding me in a field in which I had no previous ex perience. When Pound’s resources ran low, I applied to the Guggenheim Foun dation, Huntington Hartford Foundation, and other foundations to compl ete my research on the Federal Reserve. Even though my foundation applicat ions were sponsored by the three leading poets of America, Ezra Pound, E.E . Cummings, and Elizabeth Bishop, all of the foundations refused to sponsor this research. I then wrote up my findings to date, and in 1950 bega n efforts to market this manuscript in New York. Eighteen publishers turned it down without comment, but the nineteenth, Devin Garrity, preside nt of Devin Adair Publishing Company, gave me some friendly advice in his office. \"I like your"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 3 book, but we can’t print it,\" he told me. \"Neither can anybody else in New York. Why don’t you bring in a prospectus for your novel, and I think we can give you an advance. You may as well forget about gettin g the Federal Reserve book published. I doubt if it could ever be printed .\" This was devastating news, coming after two years o f intensive work. I reported back to Pound, and we tried to find a publ isher in other parts of the country. After two years of fruitless submissions, the book was published in a small edition in 1952 by two of Pound’s disciples, John Kasper and David Horton, using their private funds, under the title Mullins on the Federal Reserve. In 1954, a second edition, with unauthoriz ed alterations, was published in New Jersey, as The Federal Reserve Con spiracy. In 1955, Guido Roeder brought out a German edition in Oberammergau , Germany. The book was seized and the entire edition of 10,000 co pies burned by government agents led by Dr. Otto John. The burning of the book was upheld April 21, 1961 b y judge Israel Katz of the Bavarian Supreme Court. The U.S. Government ref used to intervene, because U.S. High Commissioner to Germany, James B. Conant (president of Harvard University 1933 to 1953), had approved the initial book burning order. This is the only book which has been burned in Germany since World War II. In 1968 a pirated edition of this book appe ared in California. Both the FBI and the U.S. Postal inspectors refused to a ct, despite numerous complaints from me during the next decade. In 1980 a new German edition appeared. Because the U.S. Government apparently no longer dictated the internal affairs of Germany, the identical book whi ch had been burned in 1955 now circulates in Germany without interference . I had collaborated on several books with Mr. H.L. H unt and he suggested that I should continue my long-delayed research on the Federal Reserve and bring out a more definitive version of this book. I had just signed a contract to write the authorized biography of Ezra Pound, an d the Federal Reserve book had to be postponed. Mr. Hunt passed away befo re I could get back to my research, and once again I faced the problem of financing research for the book. My original book had traced and named the shadowy f igures in the United States who planned the Federal Reserve Act. I now d iscovered that the men whom I exposed in 1952 as the shadowy figures behin d the operation of the Federal Reserve System were themselves shadows, the American fronts for the unknown figures who became known as the \"London Connection.\" I found that notwithstanding our successes in the War s of Independence of 1812 against England, we remained an economic and f inancial colony of Great Britain. For the first time, we located the o riginal stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks and traced their parent compa nies to the London Connection."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 4 This research is substantiated by citations and doc umentation from hundreds of newspapers, periodicals and books and charts showin g blood, marriage, and business relationships. More than a thousand issues of The New York Times on microfilm have been checked not only for origina l information, but verification of statements from other sources. It is a truism of the writing profession that a wri ter has only one book within him. This seems applicable in my case, because I am now in the fifth decade of continuous writing on a single subject, the insi de story of the Federal Reserve System. This book was from its inception co mmissioned and guided by Ezra Pound. Four of his protégés have previously been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, William Butler Yeats for his later poetry, James Joyce for \"Ulysses\", Ernest Hemingway for \"The Sun Also R ises\", and T.S. Elliot for \"The Waste Land\". Pound played a major role in the inspiration and in the editing of these works--which leads us to belie ve that this present work, also inspired by Pound, represents an ongoing liter ary tradition. Although this book in its inception was expected to be a tortuous work on economic and monetary techniques, it soon developed into a story of such universal and dramatic appeal that from the outset, Ezra Pound urged me to write it as a detective story, a genre which was in vented by my fellow Virginian, Edgar Allan Poe. I believe that the cont inuous circulation of this book during the past forty years has not only exone rated Ezra Pound for his much condemned political and monetary statements, b ut also that it has been, and will continue to be, the ultimate weapon against the powerful conspirators who compelled him to serve thirteen an d a half years without trial, as a political prisoner held in an insane as ylum a la KGB. His earliest vindication came when the government agents who rep resented the conspirators refused to allow him to testify in his own defense; the second vindication came in 1958 when these same agents dro pped all charges against him, and he walked out of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, a free man once more. His third and final vindication is this work, which doc uments every aspect of his exposure of the ruthless international financiers t o whom Ezra Pound became but one more victim, doomed to serve years a s the Man in the Iron Mask, because he had dared to alert his fellow-Amer icans to their furtive acts of treason against all people of the United St ates. In my lectures throughout this nation, and in my ap pearances on many radio and television programs, I have sounded the toxin t hat the Federal Reserve System is not Federal; it has no reserves; and it i s not a system at all, but rather, a criminal syndicate. From November, 1910, when the conspirators met on Jekyll Island, Georgia, to the present time, the machinations of the Federal Reserve bankers have been shrouded in secre cy. Today, that secrecy has cost the American people a three trillion dolla r debt, with annual interest payments to these bankers amounting to some three h undred billion dollars per year, sums which stagger the imagination, and w hich in themselves are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 5 ultimately unpayable. Officials of the Federal Rese rve System routinely issue remonstrances to the public, much as the Hindu faki r pipes an insistent tune to the dazed cobra which sways its head before him, not to resolve the situation, but to prevent it from striking him. Suc h was the soothing letter written by Donald J. Winn, Assistant to the Board o f Governors in response to an inquiry by a Congressman, the Honorable Norma n D. Shumway, on March 10, 1983. Mr. Winn states that \"The Federal R eserve System was established by an act of Congress in 1913 and is no t a ‘private corporation’.\" On the next page, Mr. Winn continues, \"The stock of the Federal Reserve Banks is held entirely by commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.\" He offers no explanation as to why the government has never owned a single share of stock in any Federal Reserve Bank, or why the Federal Reserve System is not a \"private corporatio n\" when all of its stock is owned by \"private corporations\". American history in the twentieth century has recor ded the amazing achievements of the Federal Reserve bankers. First, the outbreak of World War I, which was made possible by the funds availab le from the new central bank of the United States. Second, the Agricultural Depression of 1920. Third, the Black Friday Crash on Wall Street of Oct ober, 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. Fourth, World War II. Fif th, the conversion of the assets of the United States and its citizens from r eal property to paper assets from 1945 to the present, transforming a victorious America and foremost world power in 1945 to the world’s largest debtor n ation in 1990. Today, this nation lies in economic ruins, devastated and desti tute, in much the same dire straits in which Germany and Japan found themselves in 1945. Will Americans act to rebuild our nation, as Germany and Japan have done when they faced the identical conditions which we now fa ce--or will we continue to be enslaved by the Babylonian debt money system whi ch was set up by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 to complete our total d estruction? This is the only question which we have to answer, and we do no t have much time left to answer it.

Warburg1 On the night of November 22, 1910, a group of newsp aper reporters stood disconsolately in the railway station at Hoboken, N ew Jersey. They had just watched a delegation of the nation’s leading financ iers leave the station on a secret mission. It would be years before they disco vered what that mission was, and even then they would not understand that t he history of the United States underwent a drastic change after that night in Hoboken. The delegation had left in a sealed railway car, wi th blinds drawn, for an undisclosed destination. They were led by Senator N elson Aldrich, head of the National Monetary Commission. President Theodor e Roosevelt had signed into law the bill creating the National Mone tary Commission in 1908, after the tragic Panic of 1907 had resulted in a pu blic outcry that the nation’s monetary system be stabilized. Aldrich had led the members of the Commission on a two-year tour of Europe, spending s ome three hundred thousand dollars of public money. He had not yet ma de a report on the results of this trip, nor had he offered any plan f or banking reform. Accompanying Senator Aldrich at the Hoboken station were his private secretary, Shelton; A. Piatt Andrew, Assistant Secr etary of the Treasury, and Special Assistant of the National Monetary Commissi on; Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank of New York, He nry P. Davison, senior partner of J.P. Morgan Company, and generally regar ded as Morgan’s personal emissary; and Charles D. Norton, president of the Morgan- dominated First National Bank of New York.

Aldrich, A Leader in American Politics, Scribners, N.Y. 1930, Chap. XXIV \"Jekyll Island\" 4 T.W. Lamont, Henry P. Davison, Harper, 1933 From these references, it is possible to piece toge ther the story. Aldrich’s private car, which had left Hoboken station with it s shades drawn, had taken the financiers to Jekyll Island, Georgia. Some year s earlier, a very exclusive group of millionaires, led by J.P. Morgan, had purc hased the island as a winter retreat. They called themselves the Jekyll I sland Hunt Club, and, at first, the island was used only for hunting expedit ions, until the millionaires realized that its pleasant climate offered a warm r etreat from the rigors of winters in New York, and began to build splendid ma nsions, which they called \"cottages\", for their families’ winter vacat ions. The club building itself, being quite isolated, was sometimes in dema nd for stag parties and other pursuits unrelated to hunting. On such occasi ons, the club members who were not invited to these specific outings were asked not to appear there for a certain number of days. Before Nelson Aldrich ’s party had left New York, the club’s members had been notified that the club would be occupied for the next two weeks. The Jekyll Island Club was chosen as the place to d raft the plan for control of the money and credit of the people of the United States, not only because of its isolation, but also because it was the priva te preserve of the people who were drafting the plan. The New York Times later no ted, on May 3, 1931, in commenting on the death of George F. Baker, one of J.P. Morgan’s closest associates, that \"Jekyll Island Club has lost one o f its most distinguished members. One-sixth of the total wealth of the world was represented by the members of the Jekyll Island Club.\" Membership was by inheritance only."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 12 The Aldrich group had no interest in hunting. Jekyl l Island was chosen for the site of the preparation of the central bank because it o ffered complete privacy, and because there was not a journalist within fifty miles. Such was the need for secrecy that the members of the party agreed, b efore arriving at Jekyll Island, that no last names would be used at any tim e during their two week stay. The group later referred to themselves as the First Name Club, as the last names of Warburg, Strong, Vanderlip and the ot hers were prohibited during their stay. The customary attendants had bee n given two week vacations from the club, and new servants brought i n from the mainland for this occasion who did not know the names of any of those present. Even if they had been interrogated after the Aldrich party went back to New York, they could not have given the names. This arrangeme nt proved to be so satisfactory that the members, limited to those who had actually been present at Jekyll Island, later had a number of informal ge t-togethers in New York. Why all this secrecy? Why this thousand mile trip i n a closed railway car to a remote hunting club? Ostensibly, it was to carry ou t a program of public service, to prepare banking reform which would be a boon to the people of the United States, which had been ordered by the Na tional Monetary Commission. The participants were no stran gers to public benefactions. Usually, their names were inscribed o n brass plaques, or on the exteriors of buildings which they had donated. This was not the procedure which they followed at Jekyll Island. No brass plaq ue was ever erected to mark the selfless actions of those who met at their private hunt club in 1910 to improve the lot of every citizen of the United S tates. In fact, no benefaction took place at Jekyll Island . The Aldrich group journeyed there in private to write the banking and currency legislation which the National Monetary Commission had been ord ered to prepare in public. At stake was the future control of the mone y and credit of the United States. If any genuine monetary reform had been pre pared and presented to Congress, it would have ended the power of the elit ist one world money creators. Jekyll Island ensured that a central bank would be established in the United States which would give these bankers ev erything they had always wanted. As the most technically proficient of those present , Paul Warburg was charged with doing most of the drafting of the plan . His work would then be discussed and gone over by the rest of the group. S enator Nelson Aldrich was there to see that the completed plan would come out in a form which he could get passed by Congress, and the other bankers were there to include whatever details would be needed to be certain that they got everything they wanted, in a finished draft composed during a oneti me stay. After they returned to New York, there could be no second get together to rework their plan. They could not hope to obtain such secrecy fo r their work on a second journey."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 13 The Jekyll Island group remained at the club for ni ne days, working furiously to complete their task. Despite the common interests o f those present, the work did not proceed without friction. Senator Aldrich, always a domineering person, considered himself the chosen leader of the group, and could not help ordering everyone else about. Aldrich also felt som ewhat out of place as the only member who was not a professional banker. He h ad had substantial banking interests throughout his career, but only a s a person who profited from his ownership of bank stock. He knew little ab out the technical aspects of financial operations. His opposite number, Paul Warburg, believed that every question raised by the group demanded, not me rely an answer, but a lecture. He rarely lost an opportunity to give the members a long discourse designed to impress them with the extent of his kno wledge of banking. This was resented by the others, and often drew barbed r emarks from Aldrich. The natural diplomacy of Henry P. Davison proved to be the catalyst which kept them at their work. Warburg’s thick alien acce nt grated on them, and constantly reminded them that they had to accept hi s presence if a central bank plan was to be devised which would guarantee t hem their future pro- fits. Warburg made little effort to smooth over the ir prejudices, and contested them on every possible occasion on techni cal banking questions, which he considered his private preserve. \"In all conspiracies there must be great secrecy.\"5 The \"monetary reform\" plan prepared at Jekyll Islan d was to be presented to Congress as the completed work of the National M onetary Commission. It was imperative that the real authors of the bill re main hidden. So great was popular resentment against bankers since the Panic of 1907 that no Congressman would dare to vote for a bill bearing t he Wall Street taint, no matter who had contributed to his campaign expenses . The Jekyll Island plan was a central bank plan, and in this country t here was a long tradition of struggle against inflicting a central bank on th e American people. It had begun with Thomas Jefferson’s fight against Alexand er Hamilton’s scheme for the First Bank of the United States, backed by James Rothschild. It had continued with President Andrew Jackson’s successfu l war against Alexander Hamilton’s scheme for the Second Bank of the United States, in which Nicholas Biddle was acting as the agent for J ames Rothschild of Paris. The result of that struggle was the creation of the Independent Sub-Treasury System, which supposedly had served to keep the fun ds of the United States out of the hands of the financiers. A study of the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907 indicates that these panics were the result of the international bankers’ operations in London. The public was demanding in 1 908 that Congress enact legislation to prevent the recurrence of arti ficially induced money panics. Such monetary reform now seemed inevitable. It was to head off and control such reform that the National Monetary Comm ission had been set up with Nelson Aldrich at its head, since he was major ity leader of the Senate."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 14 The main problem, as Paul Warburg informed his coll eagues, was to avoid the name \"Central Bank\". For that reason, he had decide d upon the designation of \"Federal Reserve System\". This would deceive the people into thinking it was not a central bank. However, the Jekyll Island plan would be a central bank plan, fulfilling the main functions of a centr al bank; it would be owned by private individuals who would profit from owners hip of shares. As a bank of issue, it would control the nation’s money and c redit. In the chapter on Jekyll Island in his biography of Aldrich, Stephenson writes of the conference: \"How was the Reserve Bank to be controlled? It must be controlled by Congress. The government was to be represented in the board of directors, it was to have full knowledge of all the Bank’s, affairs, but a majority __________________________ 5 Clarendon, Hist. Reb. 1647 of the directors were to be chosen, directly or ind irectly, by the banks of the association.\"6 Thus the proposed Federal Reserve Bank was to be \"c ontrolled by Congress\" and answerable to the government, but the majority of the directors were to be chosen, \"directly or indirectl y\" by the banks of the association. In the final refinement of Warburg’s p lan, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors would be appointed by the Presid ent of the United States, but the real work of the Board would be con trolled by a Federal Advisory Council, meeting with the Governors. The C ouncil would be chosen by the directors of the twelve Federal Reserve Bank s, and would remain unknown to the public. The next consideration was to conceal the fact that the proposed \"Federal Reserve System\" would be dominated by the masters o f the New York money market. The Congressmen from the South and the West could not survive if they voted for a Wall Street plan. Farmers and smal l businessmen in those areas had suffered most from the money panics. Ther e had been great popular resentment against the Eastern bankers, whi ch during the nineteenth century became a political movement know n as \"populism\". The private papers of Nicholas Biddle, not released unt il more than a century after his death, show that quite early on the Easte rn bankers were fully aware of the widespread public opposition to them."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 15 Paul Warburg advanced at Jekyll Island the primary deception which would prevent the citizens from recognizing that his plan set up a central bank. This was the regional reserve system. He proposed a syst em of four (later twelve) branch reserve banks located in different sections of the country. Few people outside the banking world would realize that the ex isting concentration of the nation’s money and credit structure in New York mad e the proposal of a regional reserve system a delusion. Another proposal advanced by Paul Warburg at Jekyll Island was the manner of selection of administrators for the propo sed regional reserve system. Senator Nelson Aldrich had insisted that th e officials should be appointive, not elected, and that Congress should h ave no role in their selection. His Capitol Hill experience had taught h im that congressional opinion would often be inimical to the Wall Street interests, as Congressmen from the West and South might wish to demonstrate t o their constituents that they were protecting them against the Eastern bankers.

The first, as Stephenson mentions, was to dismiss the entire story as a romantic concoction which nev er actually took place. Although there were brief references to Jekyll Isla nd in later books concerning the Federal Reserve System, these also a ttracted little public attention. As we have noted, Warburg’s massive and supposedly definite work on the Federal Reserve System does not mention Jekyll Island at all, although he does admit that a conference took place . In none of his voluminous speeches or writings do the words \"Jekyl l Island\" appear, with a single notable exception. He agreed to Professor St ephenson’s request that he prepare a brief statement for the Aldrich biography . This appears on page 485 as part of \"The Warburg Memorandum\".

For it may be said without fear of contradiction that i n its fundamental features the Federal Reserve Act is the work of Mr. Warburg more than any other man in the country. The existence of a Federal Reserve Board creates, in everything but in name, a real central bank. In the two fundamentals of command of reserves and of a discou nt policy, the Federal Reserve Act has frankly accepted the principle of the Aldrich Bill, and these principles, as has been stated, were the creation o f Mr. Warburg and Mr. Warburg alone. It must not be forgo tten that Mr. Warburg had a practical object in view. In formulating his plans and in advancing in them slig htly varying suggestions from time to time, it was incumbent on him to remember that the education of the country must be gradual and that a large part of th e task was to break down prejudices and remove suspicion. His plans therefore contained all sorts of elaborate suggesti ons designed to guard the public against fancied dangers and to persuade the country that the general scheme was at all prac ticable. It was the hope of Mr. Warburg that with the lapse of time it might be possible to eliminate from the law a few c lauses which were inserted largely at his suggestion for educati onal purposes.\" Now that the public debt of the United States has p assed a trillion dollars, we may indeed admit \"how great is the indebtedness of the United States to Mr. Warburg.\" At the time he wrote the Federal Reserve Act, the public debt was almost nonexistent.

The campaign to enact the plan into law succeeded in doing just that. __________________________ 10 Frank Vanderlip, From Farmboy to Financier CHAPTER TWO The Aldrich Plan \"Finance and the tariff are reserved by Nelson Aldr ich as falling within his sole purview and jurisdiction. Mr. Aldrich is endea voring to devise, through the National Monetary Commission, a banking and cur rency law. A great many hundred thousand persons are firmly of the opi nion that Mr. Aldrich sums up in his personality the greatest and most si nister menace to the popular welfare of the United States. Ernest Newman recently said, ‘What the South visits on the Negro in a political way, A ldrich would mete out to the mudsills of the North, if he could devise a safe an d practical way to accomplish it.’\"--Harper’s Weekly, May 7, 1910.\" The participants in the Jekyll Island conference re turned to New York to direct a nationwide propaganda campaign in favor of the \"Aldrich Plan\". Three of the leading universities, Princeton, Harva rd, and the University of Chicago, were used as the rallying points for this propaganda, and national banks had to contribute to a fund of five million d ollars to persuade the American public that this central bank plan should be enacted into law by Congress. Woodrow Wilson, governor of New Jersey and former p resident of Princeton University, was enlisted as a spokesman for the Ald rich Plan. During the Panic of 1907, Wilson had declared, \"All this troub le could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven public-spirit ed men like J.P.

Much of the five million dollars of the bankers slu sh fund was spent under the auspices of the National Citizens’ League, whic h was made up of college professors. The two most tireless propagandists for the Aldrich Plan were Professor O.M. Sprague of Harvard, and J. Laurence Laughlin of the University of Chicago. Congressman Charles A.

In June, 1911, Professor Laughlin was given a year’s leave f rom the university, that he might give all of his time to the campaign of ed ucation undertaken by the League . . . He has worked indefatigably, and it is largely due to his efforts and his persistence that the campaign enters the fi nal stage with flattering prospects of a successful outcome . . . The reader knows that the University of Chicago is an institution endowed by John D.

In chapter 24 we find that: The Aldrich Plan was represented to Congress as the res ult of three years of work, study and travel by members of the National M onetary Commission, with expenditures of more than three hundred thousa nd dollars.* Testifying before the Committee on Rules, December 15, 1911, after the Aldrich plan had been introduced in Congress, Congr essman Lindbergh stated, \"Our financial system is a false one and a huge bur den on the people . . .

Instead, a panic entailed enormous losses upon us. Wall Street knew the American people were demanding a re medy against the recurrence of such a ridiculously unnatural conditi on. Most Senators and Representatives fell into the Wall Street trap and passed the Aldrich Vreeland Emergency Currency Bill. But the real purp ose was to get a monetary commission which would frame a proposition for amendments to our currency and banking laws which would suit the Money Trust. The interests are now busy everywhere educating the peo ple in favor of the Aldrich Plan. It is reported that a large sum of mo ney has been raised for this purpose. Wall Street speculation brought on th e Panic of 1907. The depositors’ funds were loaned to gamblers and anybo dy the Money Trust wanted to favour. Then when the depositors wanted t heir money, the banks did not have it. That made the panic.\" Edward Vreeland, co-author of the bill, wrote in th e August 25, 1910 Independent (which was owned by Aldrich), \"Under th e proposed monetary plan of Senator Aldrich, monopolies will disappear, because they will not be able to make more than four percent interest and mo nopolies cannot continue at such a low rate.

The sole tangible result of the Commi ssion’s three hundred thousand dollar expenditure was a library of thirty massive volumes on European banking.

Warburg Comp any. The Commission’s records show that it never functioned as a deliberative body. Indeed, its only \"meeting\" was the secret conferenc e held at Jekyll Island, and this conference is not mentioned in any publica tion of the Commission. Senator Cummins passed a resolution in Congress ord ering the Commission to report on January 8, 1912, and show some constru ctive results of its three years’ work. In the face of this challenge, the Nat ional Monetary Commission ceased to exist. With their five million dollars as a war chest, the Aldrich Plan propagandists waged a no-holds barred war against their oppositio n. Andrew Frame testified before the House Banking and Currency Com mittee of the American Bankers Association. He represented a grou p of Western bankers who opposed the Aldrich Plan: CHAIRMAN CARTER GLASS: \"Why didn’t the Western bank ers make themselves heard when the American Bankers Associat ion gave its unqualified and, we are assured, unanimous approval of the scheme proposed by the National Monetary Commission?\" ANDREW FRAME: \"I’m glad you called my attention to that. When that monetary bill was given to the country, it was but a few days previous to the meeting of the American Bankers Association in New Orleans in 1911. There was not one banker in a hundred who had read that b ill. We had twelve addresses in favor of it. General Hamby of Austin, Texas, wrote a letter to President Watts asking for a hearing against the bi ll. He did not get a very courteous answer. I refused to vote on it, and a gr eat many other bankers did likewise.\" MR. BULKLEY: \"Do you mean that no member of the Ass ociation could be heard in opposition to the bill?\" ANDREW FRAME: \"They throttled all argument.\" MR. KINDRED: \"But the report was given out that it was practically unanimous.\" ANDREW FRAME: \"The bill had already been prepared b y Senator Aldrich and presented to the executive council of t he American Bankers Association in May, 1911.

We were ready for them, but they did no t bring it up.\" Andrew Frame exposed the collusion which in 1911 pr ocured an endorsement of the Aldrich Plan from the American B ankers Association but which in 1912 did not even dare to repeat its endor sement, for fear of an honest and open discussion of the merits of the pla n. Chairman Glass then called as witness one of the te n most powerful bankers in the United States, George Blumenthal, partner of the international banking house of Lazard Freres and brother-in-law o f Eugene Meyer, Jr. Carter Glass effusively welcomed Blumenthal, statin g that \"Senator O’Gorman of New York was kind enough to suggest you r name to us.\" A year later, O’Gorman prevented a Senate Committee f rom asking his master, Paul Warburg, any embarrassing questions before app roving his nomination as the first Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. George Blumenthal stated, \"Since 1893 my firm of La zard Freres has been foremost in importations and exportations of gold a nd has thereby come into contact with everybody who had anything to do with it.\" Congressman Taylor asked, \"Have you a statement the re as to the part you have had in the importation of gold into the United States?\" Taylor asked this because the Panic of 1893 is known to economis ts as a classic example of a money panic caused by gold movements. \"No,\" replied George Blumenthal, \"I have nothing at all on that, because it is not bearing on the question.\" A banker from Philadelphia, Leslie Shaw, dissented with other witnesses at these hearings, criticizing the much vaunted \"decen tralization\" of the System. He said, \"Under the Aldrich Plan the banker s are to have local associations and district associations, and when yo u have a local organization, the centered control is assured.

And then can you not nam e the one man"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 24 everywhere else. When you have hooked the banks tog ether, they can have the biggest influence of anything in this country, with the exception of the newspapers.\" To promote the Democratic currency bill, Carter Gla ss made public the sorry record of the Republican efforts of Senator A ldrich’s National Monetary Commission. His House Report in 1913 said, \"Senator MacVeagh fixes the cost of the National Monetary Commission to May 12, 1911 at $207,130. They have since spent another hundred tho usand dollars of the taxpayer’s money. The work done at such cost cannot be ignored, but, having examined the extensive literature published by the Commission, the Banking and Currency Committee finds little that bears upon the present state of the credit market of the United States. We object to th e Aldrich Bill on the following points: Its entire lack of adequate government or public co ntrol of the banking mechanism it sets up. Its tendency to throw voting control into the hands of the large banks of the system. The extreme danger of inflation of currency inheren t in the system. The insincerity of the bond-funding plan provided f or by the measure, there being a barefaced pretense that this system was to cost the government nothing. The dangerous monopolistic aspects of the bill. Our Committee at the outset of its work was met by a well-defined sentiment in favor of a central bank which was the manifest o utgrowth of the work that had been done by the National Monetary Commission.\" Glass’s denunciation of the Aldrich Bill as a centr al bank plan ignored the fact that his own Federal Reserve Act would fulfill all the functions of a central bank. Its stock would be owned by private s tockholders who could use the credit of the Government for their own prof it; it would have control of the nation’s money and credit resources; and it would be a bank of issue which would finance the government by \"mobilizing\" credit in time of war. In \"The Rationale of Central Banking,\" Vera C. Smit h (Committee for Monetary Research and Education, June, 1981) writes , \"The primary definition of a central bank is a banking system in which a single bank has either a complete or residuary monopoly in the note issue. A central bank is not a natural product of banking development. It is imposed from outside or comes into being as the result of Government favors .\" Thus a central bank attains its commanding position from its government granted monopoly of the note issue. This is the key to its power. Also, the act"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 25 of establishing a central bank has a direct inflati onary impact because of the fractional reserve system, which allows the creatio n of book-entry loans and thereby, money, a number of times the actual \"money \" which the bank has in its deposits or reserves.

This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth.\"- -Congressman Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Sr. The speeches of Senator LaFollette and Congressman Lindbergh became rallying points of opposition to the Aldrich Plan i n 1912. They also aroused popular feeling against the Money Trust. Congressma n Lindbergh said, on December 15, 1911, \"The government prosecutes other trusts, but supports the money trust. I have been waiting patiently for several years for an opportunity to expose the false money standard, and to show that the greatest of all favoritism is that extended by the government to the money trust.\" Senator LaFollette publicly charged that a money tr ust of fifty men controlled the United States. George F. Baker, part ner of J.P. Morgan, on being queried by reporters as to the truth of the c harge, replied that it was absolutely in error. He said that he knew from pers onal knowledge that not more than eight men ran this country. The Nation Magazine replied editorially to Senator LaFollette that \"If there is a Money Trust, it will not be practical to estab lish that it exercises its influence either for good or for bad.\" Senator LaFollette remarks in his memoirs that his speech against the Money Trust later cost him the Presidency of the United S tates, just as Woodrow Wilson’s early support of the Aldrich Plan had brou ght him into consideration for that office. Congress finally made a gesture to appease popular feeling by appointing a committee to investigate the control of money and c redit in the United States. This was the Pujo Committee , a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency Committee, which conducted the famous \"Mon ey Trust\" hearings in 1912, under the leadership of Congressman Arsene Pujo of Louisiana, who was regarded as a spokesman for the oil interests. These hearings were deliberately dragged on for five months, and result ed in six-thousand pages of printed testimony in four volumes. Month after m onth, the bankers made the train trip from New York to Washington, testifi ed before the Committee and returned to New York. The hearings were extreme ly dull, and no startling information turned up at these sessions. The bankers solemnly admitted that they"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 27 were indeed bankers, insisted that they always oper ated in the public interest, and claimed that they were animated only by the highest ideals of public service, like the Congressmen before whom they were testifyi ng. The paradoxical nature of the Pujo Money Trust Hear ings may better be understood if we examine the man who single-handedl y carried on these hearings, Samuel Untermyer. He was one of the princ ipal contributors to Woodrow Wilson’s Presidential campaign fund, and wa s one of the wealthiest corporation lawyers in New York. He stat es in his autobiography in \"Who’s Who\" of 1926 that he once received a $775 ,000 fee for a single legal transaction, the successful merger of the Uta h Copper Company and the Boston Consolidated and Nevada Company, a firm with a market value of one hundred million dollars. He refused to ask e ither Senator LaFollette or Congressman Lindbergh to testify in the investig ation which they alone had forced Congress to hold. As Special Counsel for the Pujo Committee, Untermyer ran the hearings as a one-man operation. The Congressional members, including its chairman, Congressman Arsene Pujo, seemed to have been struck dumb from the commencement of the heari ngs to their conclusion. One of these silent servants of the pub lic was Congressman James Byrnes, of South Carolina, representing Berna rd Baruch’s home district, who later achieved fame as \"Baruch’s man\" , and was placed by Baruch in charge of the Office of War Mobilization during the Second World War. Although he was a specialist in such matters, Unter myer did not ask any of the bankers about the system of interlocking direct orates through which they controlled industry. He did not go into internation al gold movements, which were known as a factor in money panics, or the inte rnational relationships between American bankers and European bankers. The international banking houses of Eugene Meyer, Lazard Freres, J. & W. Seligman, Ladenburg Thalmann, Speyer Brothers, M. M. Warburg, and the Rothschild Brothers did not arouse Samuel Untermyer’s curiosit y, although it was well known in the New York financial world that all of t hese family banking houses either had branches or controlled subsidiary houses in Wall Street. When Jacob Schiff appeared before the Pujo Committe e, Mr. Untermyer’s adroit questioning allowed Mr. Schiff to talk for m any minutes without revealing any information about the operations of t he banking house of Kuhn Loeb Company, of which he was senior partner, and which Senator Robert L. Owen had identified as the representative of the European Rothschilds in the United States. The aging J.P. Morgan, who had only a few more mont hs to live, appeared before the Committee to justify his decades of inte rnational financial deals. He stated for Mr. Untermyer’s edification that \"Mon ey is a commodity.\" This was a favorite ploy of the money creators, as they wished to make the public believe that the creation of money was a nat ural occur-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 28 rence akin to the growing of a field of corn, altho ugh it was actually a bounty conferred upon the bankers by governments over whic h they had gained control. J.P. Morgan also told the Pujo Committee that, in m aking a loan, he seriously considered only one factor, a man’s chara cter; even the man’s ability to repay the loan, or his collateral, were of little importance. This astonishing observation startled even the blasé mem bers of the Committee. The farce of the Pujo Committee ended without a sin gle well-known opponent of the money creators being allowed to app ear or testify. As far as Samuel Untermyer was concerned, Senator LaFollette and Congressman Charles Augustus Lindbergh had never existed. Never theless, these Congressmen had managed to convince the people of t he United States that the New York bankers did have a monopoly on the nat ion’s money and credit. At the close of the hearings, the bankers a nd their subsidized newspapers claimed that the only way to break this monopoly was to enact the banking and currency legislation now being prop osed to Congress, a bill which would be passed a year later as the Federal R eserve Act. The press seriously demanded that the New York banking monopo ly be broken by turning over the administration of the new banking system to the most knowledgeable banker of them all, Paul Warburg. The Presidential campaign of 1912 records one of th e more interesting political upsets in American history. The incumbent , William Howard Taft, was a popular president, and the Republicans, in a period of general prosperity, were firmly in control of the governmen t through a Republican majority in both houses. The Democratic challenger, Woodrow Wilson, Governor of New Jersey, had no national recognition , and was a stiff, austere man who excited little public support. Both parties included a monetary reform bill in their platforms: The Republicans wer e committed to the Aldrich Plan, which had been denounced as a Wall St reet plan, and the Democrats had the Federal Reserve Act. Neither part y bothered to inform the public that the bills were almost identical exc ept for the names. In retrospect, it seems obvious that the money creator s decided to dump Taft and go with Wilson. How do we know this? Taft seeme d certain of reelection, and Wilson would return to obscurity. Suddenly, The odore Roosevelt \"threw his hat into the ring.\" He announced that he was ru nning as a third party candidate, the \"Bull Moose\". His candidacy would ha ve been ludicrous had it not been for the fact that he was exceptionally well-financed. Moreover, he was given unlimited press coverage, more than Taft and Wilson combined. As a Republican ex-president, it was obvious that R oosevelt would cut deeply into Taft’s vote. This proved the case, and Wilson won the election. To this day, no one can say what Theodore Roosevelt’s progr am was, or why he would sabotage his own party. Since the bankers wer e financing all three candi-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 29 dates, they would win regardless of the outcome. La ter Congressional testimony showed that in the firm of Kuhn Loeb Company, Felix Warburg was supporting Taft, Paul Warburg and Jacob Schiff were supporting Wilson, and Otto Kahn was supporting Roosevelt. The result was that a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President were elected in 1912 to get the central bank legislation passed. It seems probable that the identification of the Aldrich Plan as a Wall Street operation predicted t hat it would have a difficult passage through Congress, as the Democrat s would solidly oppose it, whereas a successful Democratic candidate, supporte d by a Democratic Congress, would be able to pass the central bank pl an. Taft was thrown overboard because the bankers doubted he could deli ver on the Aldrich Plan, and Roosevelt was the instrument of his demise. *The final electoral vote in 1912 was Wilson - 409; Roosevelt - 167; and Taft - 15. To further confuse the American people and blind th em to the real purpose of the proposed Federal Reserve Act, the architects of the Aldrich Plan, powerful Nelson Aldrich, although no longer a senat or, and Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank, set up a hue and cry against the bill. They gave interviews whenever they could find an audience denouncing the proposed Federal Reserve Act as inim ical to banking and to good government. The bugaboo of inflation was raise d because of the Act’s provisions for printing Federal Reserve notes. The Nation, on October 23, 1913, pointed out, \"Mr. Aldrich himself raised a hu e and cry over the issue of government \"fiat money\", that is, money issued with out gold or bullion back of it, although a bill to do precisely that had bee n passed in 1908 with his own name as author, and he knew besides, that the ‘gove rnment’ had nothing to do with it, that the Federal Reserve Board would ha ve full charge of the issuing of such moneys.\" Frank Vanderlip’s claims were so bizarre that Senat or Robert L. Owen, chairman of the newly formed Senate Banking and Cur rency Committee, which had been formed on March 18, 1913, accused hi m of openly carrying on a campaign of misrepresentation about the bill. The interests of the public, so Carter Glass claimed in a speech on Sept ember 10, 1913 to Congress, would be protected by an advisory council of bankers. \"There can be nothing sinister about its transactions. Meeting with it at least four times a year will be a bankers’ advisory council representi ng every regional reserve district in the system. How could we have exercised greater caution in safeguarding the public interests?\" Glass claimed that the proposed Federal Advisory Co uncil would force the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to act in the be st interest of the people. Senator Root raised the problem of inflation, claim ing that under the Federal Reserve Act, note circulation would always expand i ndefinitely, causing great inflation.

One of the critics of the proposed \"decentralized\" system was a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, Alfred Crozier: Crozier was called to testify for the Senate Committee because he had written a provocative book in 1912, U.S. Money vs. Corporation Currency.* He attacked the Aldrich- Vreeland Act of 1908 as a Wall Street instrument, and he pointed out that w hen our government had to issue money based on privately owned securities, we were no longer a free nation. Crozier testified before the Senate Committee that, \"It should prohibit the granting or calling in of loans for the purpose of influencing quotation p rices of securities and the contracting of loans or increasing interest rates in concert by the bank s to influence public opinion or the action of any legislative body. Within recent months, William McAdoo, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States was reported in the open press as cha rging specifically that there was a conspiracy among certain of the large banking interests to put a contraction upon the currency and to raise interest rates for the sake of making the public fo rce Congress into passing currency legislation desired by those interests. The so-called administr ation currency bill grants just what Wall Street and the big banks for twenty-five years have been s triving for, that is, PRIVATE INSTEAD OF PUBLIC CONTROL OF CURRENCY. It does this as complet ely as the Aldrich Bill. Both measures rob the government and the people of all e ffective control over the public’s money, and vest in the banks exclusively the dangerous power t o make money among the people scarce or plenty.

Republican parties under different names. The banke rs could not wrest control of the issuance of money from the citizens of the United States, to whom it had been designated through its Congress by the Constitution, until the Congress granted them their monopoly for a cent ral bank. Therefore, much of the influence exerted to get the Federal Re serve Act passed was done behind the scenes, principally by two shadowy, non- elected persons: The German immigrant, Paul Warburg, and Colonel Edward Mandell House of Texas. Paul Warburg made an appearance before the House Ba nking and Currency Committee in 1913, in which he briefly stated his b ackground: \"I am a member of the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company. I came over to this country in 1902, having been born and educated in t he banking business in Hamburg, Germany, and studied banking in London and Paris, and have gone all around the world. In the Panic of 1907, th e first suggestion I made was ‘Let us get a national clearing house.’ The Ald rich Plan contains some things which are simply fundamental rules of bankin g. Your aim in this plan"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 32 (the Owen-Glass bill) must be the same--centralizin g of reserves, mobilizing commercial credit, and getting an elastic note issu e.\" Warburg’s phrase, \"mobilization of credit\" was an i mportant one, because the First World War was due to begin shortly, and t he first task of the Federal Reserve System would be to finance the Worl d War. The European nations were already bankrupt, because they had mai ntained large standing armies for almost fifty years, a situation created by their own central banks, and therefore they could not finance a war. A centr al bank always imposes a tremendous burden on the nation for \"rearmament\" an d \"defense\", in order to create inextinguishable debt, simultaneously cre ating a military dictatorship and enslaving the people to pay the \"i nterest\" on the debt which the bankers have artificially created. In the Senate debate on the Federal Reserve Act, Se nator Stone said on December 12, 1913, \"The great banks for years have sought to have and control agents in the Treasury to serve their purposes. Let me quote from this World article, ‘Ju st as soon as Mr. McAdoo came to Washington, a woman whom the National City Bank had installed in the Treasury Department to get advance information on the condition of banks, and other matters of interest to the big Wall Street group, was removed. Immediately the Secretar y and the Assistant Secretary, John Skelton Williams, were criticized severely by the agents of the Wall Street group.’\" \"I myself have known more than one occasion when ba nkers refused credit to men who opposed their political views and purposes. When Senator Al drich and others were going around the country exploiting this scheme, the big banks of Ne w York and Chicago were engaged in raising a munificent fund to bolster up the Aldrich propaganda.

There are bankers of this country who are enemies of the publ ic welfare. In the past, a few great banks have followed policies and projects that have paralyzed the industrial energies of the country to perpetuate their tremendous power over the financia l and business industries of America.\" Carter Glass states in his autobiography that he wa s summoned by Woodrow Wilson to the White House, and that Wilson told him he intended to make the reserve notes obligations of the United States. Glass says, \"I was for an instant speechless. I remonstrated. There is not an y government obligation here, Mr. President. Wilson said he had had to comp romise on this point in order to save the bill.\" The term \"compromise\" on this point came directly f rom Paul Warburg. Col. Elisha Ely Garrison, in Roosevelt,* Wilson and the Federal Reserve Law wrote, \"In 1911, Lawrence Abbot, Mr. Roosevelt’s private o fficer at ‘The Outlook’ handed me a copy of the so-called Aldrich Plan for currency reform. I s aid, I could not believe that Mr. Warburg was the author. This plan is nothing more than the Aldr ich-Vreeland legislation which provided for currency issue against securities. Warburg knows th at as well as I do. I am going to see him at once and ask him about it. All right, the truth. Ye s, I wrote it, he said. Why? I asked. It was a compromise, answered Warburg.\"13 Garrison says that Warburg wrote him on February 8, 1912. \"I have no doubt that at the end of a thorough disc ussion, either you will see it my way or I will see it yours--but I hope you will see it mine.\" This was another famous Warburg saying when he secr etly lobbied Congressmen to support his interest, the veiled thr eat that they should \"see it"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 34 his way\".

House agreed entirely with the ea rly writing of Mr. Warburg.\" Page 337, he quotes Col. House: \"I am also suggesting that the Central Board be inc reased from four members to five and their terms lengthened from eight to ten years. This woul d give stability and would take away the power of a President to change the personnel of the board during a single term of office.\" __________________________ * Theodore Roosevelt 13 Elisha Ely Garrison, Roosevelt, Wilson and the F ederal Reserve Law, Christopher Publications, Boston, 1931 House’s phrase, \"take away the power of a President \" is significant, because later Presidents found themselves helpless to chang e the direction of the government because they did not have the power to c hange the composition of the Federal Reserve Board to attain a majority o n it during that President’s term of office. Garrison also wrote in this book, \"Paul Warburg is the man who got the Federal Reserv e Act together after the Aldrich Plan aroused such nationwide resentment and opposition. The mastermind of both plans was Baron Alfred Rothschild of London.\" Colonel Edward Mandell House* was referred to by Ra bbi Stephen Wise in his autobiography, Challenging Years as \"the unoffi cial Secretary of State\". House noted that he and Wilson knew that in passing the Federal Reserve Act, they had created an instrument more powerful t han the Supreme Court. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors actually com prised a Supreme Court of Finance, and there was no appeal from any of their rulings. In 1911, prior to Wilson’s taking office as Preside nt, House had returned to his home in Texas and completed a book called Phili p Dru, Administrator. Ostensibly a novel, it was actually a detailed plan for the future government of the United States, \"which would establish Social ism as dreamed by Karl"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 35 Marx\", according to House. This \"novel\" predicted t he enactment of the graduated income tax, excess profits tax, unemploym ent insurance, social security, and a flexible currency system. In short, it was the blueprint which was later followed by the Woodrow Wilson and Frankl in D. Roosevelt administrations. It was published \"anonymously\" by B. W. Huebsch of New York, and widely circulated among government offici als, who were left in no doubt as to its authorship. George Sylvester Vierec k**, who knew House for years, later wrote an account of the Wilson-House r elationship, The Strangest Friendship in History.14 In 1955, Westbro ok Pegler, the Hearst columnist from 1932 to 1956, heard of the Philip Dr u book and called Viereck to ask if he had a copy. Viereck sent Pegle r his copy of the book, and Pegler wrote a column about it, stating: \"One of the institutions outlined in Philip Dru is the Federal Reserve System.

House in 1912, is included here to show his totalitarian Mar xist philosophy. House was to become for 8 years with Wilson, the President’s closest advisor. Later he continued his influence in the Franklin D. Roosevel t administration. From his home in Magnolia, Mass., House advised FDR thro ugh frequent trips of Felix Frankfurter to the White House. Frankfurter w as later appointed to the Supreme Court by F.D.R. with many of the same personnel, and with House gui ding the administration from behind the scenes. Like most of the behind-the-scenes operators in thi s book, Col. Edward Mandell House had the obligatory \"London connection \". Originally a Dutch family, \"Huis\", his ancestors had lived in England for three hundred years, after which his father settled in Texas, where he m ade a fortune in blockade- running during the Civil War, shipping cotton and o ther contraband to his British connections, including the Rothschilds, and bringing back supplies for the beleaguered Texans. The senior House, not t rusting the volatile Texas situation, prudently deposited all his profits from his blockade-running in gold with Baring banking house in London*. At the c lose of the Civil War, he was one of the wealthiest men in Texas. He named hi s son \"Mandell\" after one of his merchant associates. According to Arthur Howden Smith, when House’s father died in 1880, his estate was distrib uted among his sons as follows: Thomas William got the banking business; J ohn, the sugar plantation; and Edward M. the cotton plantations, w hich brought him an income of $20,000 a year.16 At the age of twelve, the young Edward Mandell Hous e had brain fever, and was later further crippled by sunstroke. He was a s emi-invalid, and his ailments gave him an odd Oriental appearance. He ne ver entered any profession, but used his father’s money to become t he kingmaker of Texas politics, successively electing five governors from 1893 to 1911. In 1911 he began to support Wilson for president, and threw th e crucial Texas delegation to him which ensured his nomination. Hou se met Wilson for the first time at the Hotel Gotham, May 31, 1912. In The Strangest Friendship In History, Woodrow Wil son and Col.

Some of the bi ll’s most vocal critics had already left Washington. It was a long-standing pol itical courtesy that important legislation would not be acted upon durin g the week before Christmas, but this tradition was rudely shattered in order to perpetrate the Federal Reserve Act on the American people. The Times buried a brief quote from Congressman Lin dbergh that \"the bill would establish the most gigantic trust on earth,\" and quoted Representative Guernsey of Maine, a Republican on the House Bankin g and Currency Committee, that \"This is an inflation bill, the onl y question being the extent of the inflation.\" Congressman Lindbergh said on that historic day, to the House: \"This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on ea rth. When the President signs this bill, the invisible government by the Monetary Power will be legalized. The people may not know it immediately, but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed. The trusts will soon realize that they have gone too far even for their own good . The people must make a declaration of independence to relieve themselves from the Monetar y Power. This they will be able to do by taking control of Congress. Wall Streeters could no t cheat us if you Senators and Representatives did not make a humbug of Congress. . . . If we had a people’s Congress, there would be stability. The greatest crime of Congress is its currency syst em. The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill. The caucus and th e party bosses have again operated and prevented the people from getting the benefit of th eir own government.\" The December 23, 1913 New York Times editorially co mmented, in contrast to Congressman Lindbergh’s criticism of the bill, \" The Banking and Currency Bill became better and sounder every time it was sent from one end of the Capitol to the other. Congress worked un der public supervision in making the bill.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 42 By \"public supervision\", The Times apparently meant Paul Warburg, who for several days had maintained a small office in the C apitol building, where he directed the successful pre-Christmas campaign to p ass the bill, and where Senators and Congressmen came hourly at his bidding to carry out his strategy. The \"unprecedented speed\" with which the Federal Re serve Act had been passed by Congress during what became known as \"the Christmas massacre\" had one unforeseen aspect. Woodrow Wilson was taken unaware, as he, like many others, had been assured the bill would not come up for a vote until after Christmas. Now he refused to sign it, because he objected to the provisions for the selection of Class B. Direct ors. William L. White relates in his biography of Bernard Baruch that Bar uch, a principal contributor to Wilson’s campaign fund, was stunned when he was informed that Wilson refused to sign the bill. He hurried to the White House and assured Wilson that this was a minor matter, which could be fixed up later through \"administrative pro cesses\". The important thing was to get the Federal Reserve Act signed int o law at once. With this reassurance, Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913. History proved that on that day, the Constitution c eased to be the governing covenant of the American people, and our liberties were handed over to a small group of international bankers. The December 24, 1913 New York Times carried a fron t page headline \"WILSON SIGNS THE CURRENCY BILL!\" Below it, also in capital letters, were two further headlines, \"PROSPERITY TO BE FREE\" and \"WILL HELP EVERY CLASS\". Who could object to any la w which provided benefits to everyone? The Times described the festive atmosphere while Wilson’s family and government officials watc hed him sign the bill. \"The Christmas spirit pervaded the gathering,\" exul ted The Times. In his biography of Carter Glass, Rixey Smith state s that those present at the signing of the bill included Vice President Marshal l, Secretary Bryan, Carter Glass, Senator Owen, Secretary McAdoo, Speaker Cham p Clark, and other Treasury officials. None of the real writers of the bill, the draftees of Jekyll Island, were present. They had prudently absented t hemselves from the scene of their victory. Rixey Smith also wrote, \"It was a s though Christmas had come two days early.\" On December 24, 1913, Jacob S chiff wrote to Col. House, \"My dear Col. House. I want to say a word to you fo r the silent, but no doubt effective work you have done in the interest of currency legislation a nd to congratulate you that the measure"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 43 has finally been enacted into law. I am with good w ishes, faithfully yours, JACOB SCHIFF.\" Representative Moore of Kansas, in commenting on th e passage of the Act, said to the House of Representatives: \"The President of the United States now becomes the absolute dictator of all the finances of the country. He appoints a controlling board of seven m en, all of whom belong to his political party, even though it is a minority. The Secretary of the Treasury is to rule supreme whenever there is a difference of opinion between himself and the Fed eral Reserve Board. AND, only one member of the Board is to pass out of office while the Pre sident is in office.\" The ten year terms of office of the members of the Board were lengthened by the Banking Act of 1935 to fourteen years, which me ant that these directors of the nation’s finances, although not elected by t he people, held office longer than three presidents. While Col. House, Jacob Schiff and Paul Warburg bas ked in the glow of a job well done, the other actors in this drama were subject to later afterthoughts. Woodrow Wilson wrote in 1916, Nation al Economy and the Banking System, Sen. Doc. No. 3, No. 223, 76th Cong ress, 1st session, 1939: \"Our system of credit is concentrated (in the Feder al Reserve System). The growth of the nation, therefore, and a ll our activities, are in the hands of a few men.\" When he was asked by Clarence W. Barron whether he approved of the bill as it was finally passed. Warburg remarked, \"Well, it hasn’t got quite everything we want, but the lack can be adjusted la ter by administrative processes.\" Woodrow Wilson and Carter Glass are given credit fo r the Act by most contemporary historians, but of all those concerned , Wilson had least to do with Congressional action on the bill. George Creel , a veteran Washington correspondent, wrote in Harper’s Weekly, June 26, 1 915: \"As far as the Democratic Party was concerned, Wood row Wilson was without influence, save for the patronage he possessed. It was Bryan who whippe d Congress into line on the tariff bill, on"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 44 the Panama Canal tolls repeal, and on the currency bill.\" Mr. Bryan later wrote, \"That is the one thing in my public career that I regret--my work to secure the enactment of the Federal Reserve Law.\" On December 25, 1913, The Nation pointed out that \" The New York Stock Market began to rise steadily upon news that the Se nate was ready to pass the Federal Reserve Act.\" This belies the claim that the Federal Reserve Act was a monetary reform bill. The New York Stock Exchange is generally cons idered an accurate barometer of the true meaning of any financial legi slation passed in Washington. Senator Aldrich also decided that he no longer had misgivings about the Federal Reserve Act. In a magazine which he owned, and which he called The Independent, he wrote in July, 1914: \"Be fore the passage of this Act, the New York bankers could only dominate the r eserves of New York. Now we are able to dominate the bank reserves of th e entire country.\" H.W. Loucks denounced the Federal Reserve Act in Th e Great Conspiracy of the House of Morgan, \"In the Federal Reserve Law, they have wrested from the people and secured for themselves the constitutional power to issue money and regulate th e value thereof.\" On page 31, Loucks writes, \"The House of Morgan is now in supreme control of o ur industry, commerce and political affairs.

The present extraordinary propaganda for ‘ preparedness’ is planned more for home coercion than for defense against foreign aggressio n.\"22 The signing of the Federal Reserve Act by Woodrow W ilson represented the culmination of years of collusion with his intimate friend, Col.

Roosevelt, after the Republican hiatus of the 1920s, filled in the goals of Philip Dru, Administrator,23 which Wilson had not been able to carry out. The late Roosevelt achievements included the enactment of th e social security program, excess profits tax, and the expansion of t he graduated income tax to 90% of earned income. House’s biographer, Charles Seymour, wrote: \"He was wearied by the details of party politics and appointments. Even the share he had taken in co nstructive domestic legislation (the Federal Reserve Act, tariff revision, and the Incom e Tax amendment) did not satisfy him.

The Federal Reserve System began its operations in 1914 with the activity of the Organization Committee, appointed by Woodrow Wi lson, and composed of Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo, who wa s his son-in-law, Secretary of Agriculture Houston and Comptroller of the Currency John Skelton Williams. On January 6, 1914. J.P. Morgan met with the Organi zing Committee in New York. He informed them that there should not be more than seven regional districts in the new system. This committee was to select the locations of the \" decentralized\" reserve banks. They were empowered to select from eight to twelve reserve banks, although J.P. Morgan had testified he thought that not more than four should be selected. Much politicking went into the selection of these sites, as the twelve cities thus favored would become enormou sly important as centers of finance. New York, of course, was a foregone con clusion. Richmond was the next selection, as a payoff to Carter Glass and Woodrow Wilson, the two Virginians who had been given political credit for the Federal Reserve Act. The other selections of the Committee were Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, K ansas City, and San Francisco. All of these cities later developed impo rtant \"financial districts\" as the result of this selection. These local battles, however, paled in view of the complete dominance of the Federal Reserve bank of New York in the system. Fer dinand Lundberg pointed out, in America’s Sixty Families, that, \"In practice, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became the fountainhead of the system of twelve regional banks, for New York was the money market o f the nation. The other eleven banks were so many expensive mausoleums erec ted to salve the local pride and quell the Jacksonian fears of the hinterl and. Benjamin Strong, president of the Bankers Trust (J.P.

Benjamin Strong hel d his position as Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York un til his sudden death in 1928, during a Congressional investigation of the s ecret meetings between Reserve Governors and heads of European central banks which brought on th e Great Depression of 1929-31.\"25 Strong had married the daughter of the President of Bankers Trust, which brought him into the line of succession in the dyna stic intrigues which play such an important role in the world of high finance . He also had been a member of the original Jekyll Island group, the Fir st Name Club, and was thus qualified for the highest position in the Fede ral Reserve System, as the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York wh ich dominated the entire system. Paul Warburg also is mentioned in J. Laurence Laugh lin’s definitive volume, The Federal Reserve Act, Its Origins and Purposes, \"Mr. Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb Company offered in March, 1910 a fairly well thought out plan to be known as the United Reserve Bank of the United States. This was published in The New York Times of March 24, 1910.

The banking house of Warburg and Warburg in Hamburg has always been strictly a family business. None but a Warburg has been eligible for it, but all Warburgs have been born into it. In 1895 he married the daughter of the late Solomon Loeb of Kuhn Loeb Company. He became a member of Ku hn Loeb Company in 1902.

Besides, in the power to issue bank-note currency, it furnishes an inexhaustible supply of credit money; the second channel leads to the gr eat central banks of Europe, whereby, through the sale of acceptances, virtually guaranteed by th e United States Government, Wall Street is granted immunity from foreign demands for gold whic h have precipitated every great crisis in our history.\" For many years, there has been considerable mystery about who actually owns the stock of the Federal Reserve Banks. Congre ssman Wright Patman, leading critic of the System, tried to find out who the stockholders were. The stock in the original twelve regional Federal Reser ve Banks was purchased by national banks in those twelve regions. Because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was to set the interest rates and direc t open market operations, thus controlling the daily supply and price of mone y throughout the United States, it is the stockholders of that bank who are the real directors of the entire system. For the first time, it can be reveal ed who those stockholders are. This writer has the original organization cert ificates of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, giving the ownership of shar es by the national banks in each district. The Federal Reserve Bank of New Y ork issued 203,053 shares, and, as filed with the Comptroller of the C urrency May 19, 1914, the large New York City banks took more than half of th e outstanding shares. The Rockefeller Kuhn, Loeb-controlled National City Bank took the largest number of shares of any bank, 30,000 shares. J.P. M organ’s First National Bank took 15,000 shares. When these two banks merge d in 1955, they owned in one block almost one fourth of the shares in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which controlled the entire system, and t hus they could name Paul Volcker or anyone else they chose to be Chairm an of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Chase National Bank too k 6,000 shares. The Marine Nation Bank of Buffalo, later known as Marin e Midland, took 6,000"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 50 shares. This bank was owned by the Schoellkopf fami ly, which controlled Niagara Power Company and other large interests. National B ank of Commerce of New York City took 21,000 shares. The shareholders of these banks which own the stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yo rk are the people who have controlled our political and economic destinie s since 1914. They are the Rothschilds, of Europe, Lazard Freres (Eugene Meyer ), Kuhn Loeb Company, Warburg Company, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller family, and the J.P. Morgan interests. These interests have merged and consolidated in recent ye ars, so that the control is much more concentrated. National Bank of Commerce i s now Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Lehman Brothers has merged with Kuhn, Loeb Company, First National Bank has merged with the Na tional City Bank, and in the other eleven Federal Reserve Districts, thes e same shareholders indirectly own or control shares in those banks, wi th the other shares owned by the leading families in those areas who own or c ontrol the principal industries in these regions.* The \"local\" families set up regional councils, on orders from New York, of such groups as the Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission, and other instruments of control devised by their masters. They finance and control political d evelopments in their area, name candidates, and are seldom successfully oppose d in their plans. With the setting up of the twelve \"financial distri cts\" through the Federal Reserve Banks, the traditional division of the Unit ed States into the forty- eight states was overthrown, and we entered the era of \"regionalism\", or twelve regions which had no relation to the traditi onal state boundaries. These developments following the passing of the Fed eral Reserve Act proved every one of the allegations Thomas Jefferson had m ade against a central bank in 1791: that the subscribers to the Federal R eserve Bank stock had formed a corporation, whose stock could be and was held by aliens; that this stock would be transmitted to a certain line of suc cessors; that it would be placed beyond forfeiture and escheat; that they wou ld receive a monopoly of banking, which was against the laws of monopoly; an d that they now had the power to make laws, paramount to the laws of the st ates. No state legislature can countermand any of the laws laid down by the Fe deral Reserve Board of Governors for the benefit of their private stockhol ders. This board issues laws as to what the interest rate shall be, what th e quantity of money shall be and what the price of money shall be. All of these powers abrogate the powers of the state legislatures and their responsi bility to the citizens of those states. The New York Times stated that the Federal Reserve Banks would be ready for business on August 1, 1914, but they actually b egan operations on November 16, 1914. At that time, their total assets were listed at $143,000,000, from the sale of shares in the Federa l Reserve Banks to stockholders of the national banks which subscribed to it."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 51 The actual part of this $143,000,000 which was paid in for these shares remains shrouded in mystery. Some historians believe that t he shareholders only paid about half of the amount in cash; others believe __________________________ * See charts V through IX that they paid in no cash at all, but merely sent i n checks which they drew on the national banks which they owned. This seems mos t likely, that from the very outset, the Federal Reserve operations were \"p aper issued against paper\", that bookkeeping entries comprised the only values which changed hands. The men whom President Woodrow Wilson chose to make up the first Federal Reserve Board of Governors were men drawn f rom the banking group. He had been nominated for the Presidency by the Democratic Party, which had claimed to represent the \"common man\" aga inst the \"vested interests\". According to Wilson himself, he was all owed to choose only one man for the Federal Reserve Board. The others were chosen by the New York bankers. Wilson’s choice was Thomas D. Jones, a trustee of Princeton and director of International Harvester and other c orporations. The other members were Adolph C. Miller, economist from Rocke feller’s University of Chicago and Morgan’s Harvard University, and also s erving as Assistant Secretary of the Interior; Charles S. Hamlin, who h ad served previously as an Assistant Secretary to the Treasury for eight ye ars; F.A. Delano, a Roosevelt relative, and railroad operator who took over a number of railroads for Kuhn, Loeb Company, W.P.G. Harding, P resident of the First National Bank of Atlanta; and Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb Company. According to The Intimate Papers of Col. House, War burg was appointed because \"The President accepted (House’s) suggestio n of Paul Warburg of New York because of his interest and experience in currency problems under both Republican and Democratic Administrations.\"27 Like Warburg, Delano had also been born outside the continental l imits of the United States, although he was an American citizen. Delano’s fathe r, Warren Delano, according to Dr. Josephson and other authorities, w as active in Hong Kong in the Chinese opium trade, and Frederick Delano wa s born in Hong Kong in 1863. In The Money Power of Europe, Paul Emden writes tha t \"The Warburgs reached their outstanding eminence during the last twenty years of the past century, simultaneously with the growth of Kuhn, Lo eb Company in New York, with whom they stood in a personal union and family relationship.

This might have meant some questions abou t the secret conference in Jekyll Island, and Warburg refused to appear. On July 7, 1914 he wrote a letter to G.M. Hitchcock, Chairman of the Senate Ba nking and Currency Committee, stating that it might impair his usefuln ess on the Board if he were required to answer any questions, and that he would therefore withdraw his name. It seemed that Warburg was prepa red to bluff the Senate Committee into confirming him without any qu estions asked. On July 10, 1914, The New York Times defended Warburg on th e editorial page and denounced the \"Senatorial Inquisition\". Since Warbu rg had not yet been asked any questions, the term \"Inquisition\" seemed remarkably inappropriate, nor was there any real danger that t he Senators were preparing to use instruments of torture on Mr. Warb urg. The imbroglio was resolved when the Senate Committee, in abject surre nder, agreed that Mr. Warburg would be given a list of questions in advan ce of his appearance so that he could go over them, and that he could be ex cused from answering any questions which might tend to impair his service on the Board of Governors. The Nation reported on July 23, 1914 that \"Mr. Warb urg finally had a conference with Senator O’Gorman and agreed to meet the members of the Senate Subcommittee informally, with a view to comi ng to an understanding, and to giving them any reasonable information they might desire.

Barron, More They Told Barron, Arno Press, New York Times, 1973, June 12, 1914. p. 204 was correct. Mr. Warburg was confirmed, the way hav ing been smoothed by his \"fixer\", Senator O’Gorman of New York, more fam iliarly known as \"the Senator from Wall Street\". Senator Robert L. Owen h ad previously charged that Warburg was the American representative of the Rothschild family, but questioning him about this would indeed have smacke d of the mediaeval \"Inquisition\", and his fellow Senators were too civ ilized to indulge in such barbarity*. During the Senate Hearings on Paul Warburg before t he Senate Banking and Currency Committee, August 1, 1914, Senator Bristow asked, \"How many of these partners (of Kuhn, Loeb Company) are American citizens?\" WARBURG: \"They are all American citizens except Mr. Kahn. He is a British subject.\" BRISTOW: \"He was at one time a ca ndidate for Parliament, was he not?\" WARBURG: \"There was talk a bout it, it had been suggested and he had it in his mind.\" Paul Warburg also stated to the Committee, \"I went to England, where I stayed for two years, first in the banking and disc ount firm of Samuel Montague & Company. After that I went to France, wh ere I stayed in a French bank.\" CHAIRMAN: \"What French bank was that?\" WARBURG: \"It is the Russian bank for foreign trade which has an agency in Paris.\" BRISTOW: \"I understand you to say that you were a R epublican, but when Mr. Theodore Roosevelt came around, you then became a sympathizer with Mr. Wilson and supported him?\" WARBURG: \"Yes.\" BRIS TOW: \"While your brother (Felix Warburg) was supporting Taft?\" WARBURG: \"Yes.\" Thus three partners of Kuhn, Loeb Company were supp orting three different candidates for President of the United St ates. Paul Warburg was supporting Wilson, Felix Warburg was supporting Taf t, and Otto Kahn was supporting Theodore Roosevelt. Paul Warburg explain ed this curious situation by telling the Committee that they had no influence over each other’s political beliefs, \"as finance and politics don’t mix.\" Questions about Warburg’s appointment vanished in a hue and cry with Wilson’s sole appointment to the Board of Governors , Thomas B.

When the Federal Reserve Banks were opened for busi ness on November 16, 1914, Paul Warburg said, \"This date may be consider ed as the Fourth of July in the economic history of the United States.\""},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 55 CHAPTER FOUR The Federal Advisory Council In steamrolling the Federal Reserve Act through the House of Representatives, Congressman Carter Glass declared on September 30, 1913 on the floor of the House that the interests of the public would be protected by an advisory council of bankers. \"There can be no thing sinister about its transactions. Meeting with it at least four times a year will be a bankers’ advisory council representing every regional reserv e district in the system. How could we have exercised greater caution in safe guarding the public interest? Carter Glass neither then nor later gave any substa ntiation for his belief that a group of bankers would protect the interests of t he public, nor is there any evidence in the history of the United States that a ny group of bankers has ever done so. In fact, the Federal Advisory Council proved to be the \"administrative process\" which Paul Warburg had ins erted into the Federal Reserve Act to provide just the type of remote but unseen control over the System which he desired. When he was asked by finan cial reporter C.W. Barron, just after the Federal Reserve Act was enac ted into law by Congress, whether he approved of the bill as it was finally p assed, Warburg replied, \"Well, it hasn’t got quite everything we want, but the lack can be adjusted later by administrative processes.\" The council pro ved to be the ideal vehicle for Warburg’s purposes, as it has functioned for se venty years in almost complete anonymity, its members and their business associations, unnoticed by the public. Senator Robert Owen, chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, had said, as quoted in The New York Time s, August 3, 1913 before passage of the act: \"The Federal Reserve Act will furnish the bank and industrial and commercial interests with the discount of qualified commercial paper and thus sta bilize our commercial and industrial life. The Federal Reserve banks are not intended as money mak ing banks, but to serve a great national purpose of accommodating commerce and businessmen a nd banks, safeguard a fixed market for manufactured goods, for agricultural products and f or labor. There is no reason why the banks"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 56 should be in control of the Federal Reserve system. Stability will make our commerce expand healthfully in every direction.\" Senator Owen’s optimism was doomed by the dominatio n of the Jekyll Island promoters over the initial composition of the Feder al Reserve System. Not only did the Morgan-Kuhn, Loeb alliance purchase th e dominant control of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with almost half of the shares owned by the five New York banks under their control, First National Bank, National City Bank, National Bank of Commerce , Chase National Bank and Hanover National Bank, but they also persu aded President Woodrow Wilson to appoint one of the Jekyll Island group, Paul Warburg, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Each of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks was to ele ct a member of the Federal Advisory Council, which would meet with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors four times a year in Washington, in order to \"advise\" the Board on future monetary policy. This seemed to assure absolute democracy, as each of the twelve \"advisors\", repres enting a different region of the United States, would be expected to speak up for the economic interests of his area, and each of the twelve membe rs would have an equal vote. The theory may have been admirable in its con cept, but the hard facts of economic life resulted in a quite different pict ure. The president of a small bank in St. Louis or Cincinnati, sitting in confere nce with Paul Warburg and J.P. Morgan to \"advise\" them on monetary policy, wo uld be unlikely to contradict two of the most powerful international f inanciers in the world, as a scribbled note from either one of them would be s ufficient to plunge his little bank into bankruptcy. In fact, the small ban ks of the twelve Federal Reserve districts existed only as satellites of the big New York financial interests, and were completely at their mercy. Mart in Mayer, in The Bankers, points out that \"J.P. Morgan maintained co rrespondent relationships with many small banks all over the co untry.\"30 The big New York banks did not confine themselves to multi-mill ion dollar deals with other great financial interests, but carried on man y smaller and more routine dealings with their \"correspondent\" banks across th e United States. Apparently secure in their belief that their activi ties would never be exposed to the public, the Morgan-Kuhn, Loeb interests bold ly selected the members of the Federal Advisory Council from their correspo ndent banks and from banks in which they owned stock. No one in the fina ncial community seemed to notice, as nothing was said about it during seve nty years of the Federal Reserve System’s operation. To avoid any suspicion that New York interests migh t control the Federal Advisory Council, its first president, elected in 1 914 by the other members, was J.B.

However, the re lationship between First National Bank of Chicago and these New York b anks was even closer than these listings indicate. On page 701 of The Growth of Chicago Banks by F.

Baker to become a director of t he First National Bank of Chicago.\"31 (J.B. Forgan to Ream, January 7, 1903.) In effect, Baker and Morgan had personally chosen the first president of the Federal Advisory Council. James B. Forgan (1852-1924) also shows the obligato ry \"London Connection\" in the operation of the Federal Reserve System. Born in St. Andrew’s, Scotland, he began his banking career the re with the Royal Bank of Scotland, a correspondent of the Bank of England . He came to Canada for the Bank of British North America, worked for the B ank of Nova Scotia, which sent him to Chicago in the 1880’s, and by 190 0 he had become president of the First National Bank of Chicago. He served for six years as president of the Federal Advisory Council, and when he left the council, he was replaced by Frank O. Wetmore, who had also repl aced him as president of the First National Bank of Chicago when Forgan w as named chairman of the board. Representing the New York Federal Reserve district on the first Federal Advisory Council was J.P. Morgan. He was named chai rman of the Executive Committee. Thus, Paul Warburg and J.P. Mo rgan sat in conference at the meetings of the Federal Reserve B oard during the first four years of its operation, surrounded by the other Gov ernors and members of the council, who could hardly have been unaware tha t their futures would be guided by these two powerful bankers.

These were all correspondent banks of the New York \"big five\" banks who controlled the mo ney market in the United States. Jaffray had an even closer connection with the Bake r-Morgan interests. In 1908, to reinvest the large annual dividends from t heir First National Bank of New York stock, Baker and Morgan set up a holdin g company, First Security Corporation, which bought 500 shares of th e First National Bank of Minneapolis. Thus Jaffray was little more than a wa ge-earning employee of Baker and Morgan, although he had been \"selected\" b y stockholders of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to represent th eir interests. First Security Corporation also owned 50,000 shares of Ch ase National Bank, 5400 shares of National Bank of Commerce, 2500 shares of Bankers Trust, 928 shares of Liberty National Bank, the bank of which Henry P. Davison had been president when he was tapped to join the J.P. Morgan firm, and shares of New York Trust, Atlantic Trust and Brooklyn Trus t. First Security concentrated on bank stocks which rapidly appreciat ed in value, and paid handsome annual dividends. In 1927, it earned five million dollars, but paid the shareholders eight million, taking the rest fro m its surplus. Another member of the initial Federal Advisory Coun cil was E.F. Swinney, president of the First National Bank of Kansas City . He was also a director of Southern Railway, and lists himself in Who’s Who as \"independent in politics\". Archibald Kains represented the San Francisco distr ict on the Federal Advisory Council, although he maintained his office in New York, as president of the American Foreign Banking Corporati on. After serving as a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1914-1918, Paul Warburg did not request another term. However, he was not ready to sever his connection with the Federal Reserve Syste m which he had done so much to set up and put into operation. J.P. Morgan obligingly gave up his seat on the Federal Advisory Council, and for the n ext ten years, Paul Warburg continued to represent the Federal Reserve district of New York on the Council.

Thus Warburg remained the dominant presenc e at Federal Reserve Board meetings throughout the 1920s, when the Europ ean central banks were planning the great contraction of credit which precipitated the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Although most of the Federal Advisory Council’s \"ad vice\" to the Board of Governors has never been reported, on rare instance s a few glimpses into its deliberations were afforded by brief items in The N ew York Times. On November 21, 1916, The Times reported that the Fede ral Advisory Council had met in Washington for its quarterly conference. \"There was talk about absorbing Europe’s extension of credit to South America and other countries. Federal Reserve officials said that to m aintain a position as one of the world’s bankers the United States must expect to be called upon to render a good deal of the service performed largely by England in the past, in extending short term credits necessary in the production and transportation of goods of all kinds in the world’s trade, and that acceptances in foreign trade require lower discounts and the freest and most rel iable gold markets.\" (The First World War was at its zenith in 1916.) In addition to his service on the Board of Governor s and the Federal Advisory Council, Paul Warburg continued to address bankers’ groups about the monetary policies they were expected to f ollow. On October 22, 1915, he addressed the Twin City Bankers Club, St. Paul, Minnesota during which speech he stated, \"It is to your interest to see the Federal Reserve banks as strong as they possibly can be. It staggers the imagination to think what the future m ay have in store for the development of American banking.

The scope of our banking future will ultimately be limited by the amount of gold that we can muster as the foundation of our banking and credit structure.\" The composition of the Federal Reserve Board of Gov ernors and the Federal Reserve Advisory Council, from its initial membersh ip to the present day, shows links to the Jekyll Island conference and the London banking community which offers incontrovertible evidence, a cceptable in any court of law, that there was a plan to gain control of the m oney and credit of the people of the United States, and to use it for the profit of the architects. Old Jekyll Island hands were Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank, which bought a large portion of the shares of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914; Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loe b Company; Henry P. Davison, J.P. Morgan’s righthand man, and direct or of the First National Bank of New York and the National Bank of Commerce, which took a large portion of Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock; and Benjamin Strong, also known as a Morgan lieutenant, who served as Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the 1920’s.* The selection of the regional members of the Federa l Advisory Council from the list of bankers who worked most closely with th e \"big five\" banks of New York, and who were their principal correspondent ba nks, proves that the much-touted \"regional safeguarding of the public in terest\" by Carter Glass and other Washington proponents of the Federal Rese rve Act was from its very inception a deliberate deception. The fact tha t for seventy years this council was able to meet with the Federal Reserve B oard of Governors and to \"advise\" the Governors on decisions of monetary pol icy which affected the daily lives of every person in the United States, w ithout the public being aware of their existence, demonstrates that the pla nners of the central bank operation knew exactly how to achieve their objecti ves through \"administrative processes\" of which the public woul d remain ignorant. The claim that the \"advice\" of the council members is n ot binding on the Governors or that it carries no weight is to claim that four times a year, twelve of the most influential bankers in the Unite d States take time from their work to travel to Washington to meet with the Federal Reserve Board merely to drink coffee and exchange pleasantries. I t is a claim which anyone familiar with the workings of the business communit y will find impossible to take seriously. In 1914, it was a four-day trip eac h way for bankers from the Far West to come to Washington for a council meetin g with the Federal Reserve Board.

An heir to the Baldwin fo rtune (a company controlled by Morgan), Preston married the heiress to the Pulitzer newspaper fortune. On February 26, 1929, The New Yo rk Times noted that a merger had been effected between National Bank of C ommerce and Guaranty Trust, making them the largest bank in the United States, with a capital of two billion dollars. The merger was nego tiated by Myron C. Taylor, president of U.S. Steel, a Morgan firm. The banks occupied adjoining buildings on Wall Street, and, as The New York Time s noted, \"The Guaranty Trust Company long has been known as one o f ‘the Morgan group’ of banks.\" The National Bank of Commerce has also been identified with Morgan interests."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 62 CHAPTER FIVE The House of Rothschild The success of the Federal Reserve Conspiracy will raise many questions in the minds of readers who are unfamiliar with the hi story of the United States and finance capital. How could the Kuhn, Loeb-Morga n alliance, powerful though it might be, believe that it would be capabl e, first, of devising a plan which would bring the entire money and credit of th e people of the United States into their hands, and second, of getting suc h a plan enacted into law? The capability of devising and enacting the \"Nation al Reserve Plan\", as the immediate result of the Jekyll Island expedition wa s called, was easily within the powers of the Kuhn, Loeb-Morgan alliance, accor ding to the following from McClure’s Magazine, August 1911, \"The Seven Me n\" by John Moody: \"Seven men in Wall Street now control a great share of the fundamental industry and resources of the United States. Three of the seven men, J.P. Morgan, James J. Hill, and George F. Baker, head of the First National Bank of New York belong to the so-called Morgan group; four of them, John D. and William Rockefeller, James Stillman, he ad of the National City Bank, and Jacob H. Schiff of the private banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb Co mpany, to the so-called Standard Oil City Bank group... the c entral machine of capital extends its control over the Uni ted States... The process is not only economically logical; it is now practically automatic.\"32 Thus we see that the 1910 plot to seize control of the money and credit of the people of the United States was planned by men who already controlled most of the country’s resources. It seemed to John Moody \"practically automatic\" that they should continue with their operations. What John Moody did not know, or did not tell his r eaders, was that the most powerful men in the United States were themsel ves answerable to another power, a foreign power, and a power which h ad been steadfastly seeking to extend its control over the young republ ic of the United States since its very inception.

The ten largest b ank holding companies in the United States are firmly in the hands of certai n banking houses, all of which have branches in London. They are J.P. Morgan Company, Brown Brothers Harriman, Warburg, Kuhn Loeb and J. Henry Schroder. All of them maintain close relationships with the House of Rothschild, principally through the Rothschild control of international mon ey markets through its manipulation of the price of gold. Each day, the wo rld price of gold is set in the London office of N.M. Rothschild and Company. Although these firms are ostensibly American firms, which merely maintain branches in London, the fact is that these banking houses actually take their direction from London. Their history is a fascinati ng one, and unknown to the American public, originating as it did in the i nternational traffic in gold, slaves, diamonds, and other contraband. There are n o moral considerations in any business decision made by these firms. They are interested solely in money and power. Tourists today gape at the magnificent mansions of the very rich in Newport, Rhode Island, without realizing that not only do th ese \"cottages\" stand as a memorial to the baronial desires of our Victorian m illionaires, but that their erection in Newport represented a nostalgic memoria lization of the great American fortunes, which had their beginnings in Ne wport when it was the capital of the slave trade. The slave trade for centuries had its headquarters in Venice, until Seventeenth Century Britain, the new master of the seas, used its control of the oceans to gain a monopoly. As the American colo nies were settled, its fiercely independent people, most of whom did not w ant slaves, found to their surprise that slaves were being sent to our p orts in great numbers. For many years, Newport was the capital of this uns avory trade. William Ellery, the Collector of the Port of Newport, said in 1791: \"...an Ethiopian cld as soon change his skin as a N ewport merchant cld be induced to change so lucrative a trade.... for the slow profits of any m anufactory.\" John Quincy Adams remarked in his Diary, page 459, \"Newport’s former prosperity was chiefly owing to its extensive emplo yment in the African slave trade.\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 64 The pre-eminence of J.P. Morgan and the Brown firm in American finance can be dated to the development of Baltimore as the ninete enth century capital of the slave trade. Both of these firms originated in Baltimore, opened branches in London, came under the aegis of the House of Rot hschild, and returned to the United States to open branches in New York and to become the dominant power, not only in finance, but also in government. In recent years, key posts such as Secretary of Defense have been held by Robe rt Lovett, partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, and Thomas S. Gates, partn er of Drexel and Company, a J.P. Morgan sub- sidiary firm. The present Vice President, George Bu sh, is the son of Prescott Bush, a partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, for man y years the senator from Connecticut, and the financial organizer of Co lumbia Broadcasting System of which he also was a director for many yea rs. To understand why these firms operate as they do, i t is necessary to give a brief history of their origins. Few Americans know that J.P. Morgan Company began as George Peabody and Company. George Peabody (1795- 1869), born at South Danvers, Massachusetts, began business in Georgetown, D.C. in 1814 as Peabody, Riggs and Company, dealing in wholesale dry goods, and in operating the Georgetown Slave Market . In 1815, to be closer to their source of supply, they moved to Baltimore, where they operated as Peabody and Riggs, from 1815 to 1835. Peabody found himself increasingly involved with business originating from London, and in 1835, he established the firm of George Peabody and Company in London. H e had excellent entree in London business through another Baltimore firm established in Liverpool, the Brown Brothers. Alexander Brown came to Baltimore in 1801, and established what is now known as the oldest ban king house in the United States, still operating as Brown Brothers Harriman of New York; Brown, Shipley and Company of England; and Alex Brown and Son of Baltimore. The behind the scenes power wielded by this firm is indicated by the fact that Sir Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England for many years, was a partner of Brown, Shipley and Company.* Considere d the single most influential banker in the world, Sir Montagu Norman was organizer of \"informal talks\" between heads of central banks in 1927, which led directly to the Great Stockmarket Crash of 1929. Soon after he arrived in London, George Peabody was surprised to be summoned to an audience with the gruff Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Without mincing words, Rothschild revealed to Peabo dy, that much of the London aristocracy openly disliked Rothschild and r efused his invitations. He proposed that Peabody, a man of modest means, be established as a lavish host whose entertainments would soon be the talk of London. Rothschild would, of course, pay all the bills. Peabody accept ed the offer, and soon became known as the most popular host in London.

It is hardly surprising that the most popular host in London would also become a very successful businessman, particularly with the House of Rothschild supporting him behind the scenes. Peabod y often operated with a capital of 500,000 pounds on hand, and became very astute in his buying and selling on both sides of the Atlantic. His American agent was the Boston firm of Beebe, Morgan and Company, headed by Junius S. M organ, father of John Pierpont Morgan. Peabody, who never married, h ad no one to succeed him, and he was very favorably impressed by the tal l, handsome Junius Morgan. He persuaded Morgan to join him in London a s a partner in George Peabody and Company in 1854. In 1860, John P ierpont Morgan had been taken on as an apprentice by the firm of Dunca n, Sherman in New York. He was not very attentive to business, and in 1864, Morgan’s father was outraged when Duncan, Sherman refused to make h is son a partner. He promptly extended an arrangement whereby one of the chief employees of Duncan, Sherman, Charles H. Dabney, was persuaded t o join John Pierpont Morgan in a new firm, Dabney, Morgan and Company. B ankers Magazine, December, 1864, noted that Peabody had withdrawn hi s account from Duncan, Sherman, and that other firms were expected to do so. The Peabody account, of course, went to Dabney, Morgan Company. John Pierpont Morgan was born in 1837, during the f irst money panic in the United States. Significantly, it had been caused by the House of Rothschild, with whom Morgan was later to become associated. In 1836, President Andrew Jackson, infuriated by th e tactics of the bankers who were attempting to persuade him to renew the ch arter of the Second Bank of the United States, said, \"You are a den of vipers. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.\" Although Nicholas Biddle was President of the Bank of the United States, it was well known that Baron James de Rothschild of Pa ris was the principal investor in this central bank. Although Jackson had vetoed the renewal of the charter of the Bank of the United States, he probab ly was unaware that a few months earlier, in 1835, the House of Rothschild ha d cemented a relationship"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 66 with the United States Government by superseding th e firm of Baring as financial agent of the Department of State on January 1, 1835 . Henry Clews, the famous banker, in his book, Twenty -eight Years in Wall Street33, states that the Panic of 1837 was enginee red because the charter of the Second Bank of the United States had run out in 1836. Not only did President Jackson promptly withdraw government fund s __________________________ 33 Henry Clews, Twenty-eight Years in Wall Street, Irving Company, New York, 1888, page 157 from the Second Bank of the United States, but he d eposited these funds, $10 million, in state banks. The immediate result, Clew s tells us, is that the country began to enjoy great prosperity. This sudde n flow of cash caused an immediate expansion of the national economy, and th e government paid off the entire national debt, leaving a surplus of $50 million in the Treasury. The European financiers had the answer to this situ ation. Clews further states, \"The Panic of 1837 was aggravated by the Ba nk of England when it in one day threw out all the paper connected with the United States.\" The Bank of England, of course, was synonymous with the name of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Why did the Bank of Englan d in one day \"throw out\" all paper connected with the United States, th at is, refuse to accept or discount any securities, bonds or other financial p aper based in the United States? The purpose of this action was to create an immediate financial panic in the United States, cause a complete contraction of credit, halt further issues of stocks and bonds, and ruin those seeking to turn United States securities into cash. In this atmosphere of financi al panic, John Pierpont Morgan came into the world. His grandmother, Joseph Morgan, was a well to do farmer who owned 106 acres in Hartford, Conne cticut. He later opened the City Hotel, and the Exchange Coffee Shop, and i n 1819, was one of the founders of the Aetna Insurance Company. George Peabody found that he had chosen well in sel ecting Junius S. Morgan as his successor. Morgan agreed to continue the sub rosa relationship with N.M. Rothschild Company, and soon expanded the firm ’s activities by shipping large quantities of railroad iron to the U nited States. It was Peabody iron which was the foundation for much of A merican railroad tracks from 1860 to 1890. In 1864, content to retir e and leave his firm in the hands of Morgan, Peabody allowed the name to be cha nged to Junius S. Morgan Company. The Morgan firm then and since has always been directed from London. John Pierpont Morgan spent mu ch of his time at his magnificent London mansion, Prince’s Gate."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 67 One of the high water marks of the successful Roths child-Peabody Morgan business venture was the Panic of 1857. It had been twenty years since the Panic of 1837: its lessons had been forgotten by ho rdes of eager investors who were anxious to invest the profits of a develop ing America. It was time to fleece them again. The stock market operates lik e a wave washing up on the beach. It sweeps with it many minuscule creatur es who derive all of their life support from the oxygen and water of the wave. They coast along at the crest of the \"Tide of Prosperity\". Suddenly the wav e, having reached the high water mark on the beach, recedes, leaving all of the creatures gasping on the sand. Another wave may come in time to save them, but in all likelihood it will not come a s far, and some of the sea creatures are doomed. In the same manner, waves of prosperity, fed by newly created money, through an artificial contract ion of credit, recedes, leaving those it had borne high to gasp and die wit hout hope of salvation. Corsair, the Life of J.P. Morgan,34 tells us that t he Panic of 1857 was caused by the collapse of the grain market and by the sudd en collapse of Ohio Life and Trust, for a loss of five million dollars. With this collapse nine hundred other American companies failed. Significantly, one not only survived, but prospered from the crash. In Corsair, we learn that the Bank of England lent George Peabody and Company five million pounds duri ng the panic of 1857. Winkler, in Morgan the Magnificent35 says that the Bank of England advanced Peabody one million pounds, an enormous su m at that time, and the equivalent of one hundred million dollars today , to save the firm. However, no other firm received such beneficence du ring this Panic. The reason is revealed by Matthew Josephson, in The Rob ber Barons. He says on page 60: \"For such qualities of conservatism and purity, Geo rge Peabody and Company, the old tree out of which the House of Morgan grew, was famous. In the panic of 1857, when depreciated securities had been thrown on the market by distressed investo rs in America, Peabody and the elder Morgan, being in possession of cash, had purchased such bonds as possessed real value freely, and then resold them at a large advance when sanity was restored.\"36 Thus, from a number of biographies of Morgan, the s tory can be pieced together. After the panic had been engineered, one firm came into the market with one million pounds in cash, purchased securiti es from distressed investors at panic prices, and later resold them at an enormous profit. That firm was the Morgan firm, and behind it was the cle ver maneuvering of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 68 Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild. The association rema ined secret from the most knowledgeable financial minds in London and New Yor k, although Morgan occasionally appeared as the financial agent in a R othschild operation. As the Morgan firm grew rapidly during the late nineteenth century, until it dominated the finances of the nation, many observer s were puzzled that the Rothschilds seemed so little interested in profitin g by investing in the rapidly advancing American economy. John Moody notes, in Th e Masters of Capital, page 27, \"The Rothschilds were content to remain a close ally of Morgan... as far as the American field was concerned.’37 Secrecy was more profitable than valor. __________________________ 34 Corsair, The Life of Morgan 35 John K.

Morg an and Company is explained by George Wheeler, in Pierpont Morgan and Friends, the Anatomy of a Myth, page 17: \"But there were steps being taken even now to bring him out of the financial backwaters--and they were not being taken by Pierpont Morgan himsel f. The first suggestion of his name for a role in the recharging of the reserve originated with th e London branch of the House of Rothschild, Belmont’s employers.\"38 Wheeler goes on to explain that a considerable anti -Rothschild movement had developed in Europe and the United States which focused on the banking activities of the Rothschild family. Even though th ey had a registered agent in the United States, August Schoenberg, who had ch anged his name to Belmont when he came to the United States as the re presentative of the Rothschilds in 1837, it was extremely advantageous to them to have an American representative who was not known as a Roth schild agent. Although the London house of Junius S.

This control of the world business structure and of huma n happiness and progress by a small group is a matter of the most intense pu blic interest. In analyzing it, we must begin with the internal group which cen ters itself around J.P. Morgan Company. Never before had there been such a powerful centralized control over finance, industrial production, credit and wages as is at this time vested in the Morgan group... The Morgan control of the Federal Reserve System is exercised through control of the manageme nt of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. George F. Peabody History of the Great American For tunes, Gustavus Myers, Mod. Lib. 537, notes that J.P. Morgan’s fath er, Junius S. Morgan, had become a partner of George Peabody in the banki ng business. \"When the Civil War came on, George Peabody and Company w ere appointed the financial representatives in England of the U.S. Go vernment.... with this appointment their wealth suddenly began to pile up; where hitherto they had amassed the riches by stages not remarkably rapid, they now added many millions within a very few years.\" According to wri ters of the day, the methods of George Peabody & Company were not only u nreasonable but double treason, in that, while in the act of giving inside aid to the enemy, George Peabody & Company were the potentiaries of t he U.S. Government and were being well paid to advance its interests. \"Springfield Republic\", 1866: \"For all who know anything on the subject kno w very well that Peabody and his partners gave us no faith and no he lp in our struggle for national existence.

This agreement re ached, Mayer unfolded his revolutionary plan. The project would be backed by all the power that could be purchased with their pooled resources.

Rothschild turned to a manuscript and proceeded to read a care fully prepared plan of action. 1. He argued that LAW was FORCE only in dis guise. He reasoned it was logical to conclude ‘By the laws of nature righ t lies in force.’ 2. Political freedom is an idea, not a fact. In order to usurp p olitical power all that was necessary was to preach ‘Liberalism’ so that the el ectorate, for the sake of an idea, would yield some of their power and prerogati ves which the plotters could then gather into their own hands. 3. The spea ker asserted that the Power of Gold had usurped the power of Liberal rule rs.... He pointed out that it was immaterial to the success of his plan w hether the established governments were destroyed by external or internal foes because the victor had to of necessity ask the aid of ‘Capital’ which ‘Is entirely in our hands’. 4.

When the Elector of Hesse earned a fortune by renting Hessian mercenaries to the Briti sh to put down the rebellion in the American colonies, Rothschild was entrusted with this money to invest. He made an excellent profit both for him self and the Elector, and attracted other accounts. In 1785 he moved to a lar ger house, 148 Judengasse, a five story house known as \"The Green Shield\" which he shared with the Schiff family. The five sons established branches in the principal cities of Europe, the most successful being James in Paris and Nathan Mayer in London. Ignatius Balla in The Romance of the Rothschilds46 tells us how th e London Rothschild established his fortune. He went to Waterloo, where the fate of Europe hung in the balance, saw that Napoleon was losing the ba ttle, and rushed back to Brussels. At Ostend, he tried to hire a boat to Eng land, but because of a raging storm, no one was willing to go out. Rothsch ild offered 500 francs, then 700, and finally 1,000 francs for a boat. One sailor said, \"I will take you for 2000 francs; then at least my widow will have s omething if we are drowned.\" Despite the storm, they crossed the Chann el. The next morning, Rothschild was at his usual post in the London Exchange. Everyone noticed how pale and exhausted he looked. Suddenly, he started selling, dumping large quantities of securities. Pa nic immediately swept the Exchange. Rothschild is selling; he knows we have l ost the Battle of Waterloo. Rothschild and all of his known agents co ntinued to throw securities onto the market. Balla says, \"Nothing co uld arrest the disaster. At the same time he was quietly buying up all securiti es by means of secret agents whom no one knew. In a single day, he had ga ined nearly a million sterling, giving rise to the saying, ‘The Allies wo n the Battle of Waterloo, but it was really Rothschild who won.’\"* In The Profits of War, Richard Lewinsohn says, \"Rot hschild’s war profits from the Napoleonic Wars financed their later stock speculations. Under Metternich, Austria after long hesitation, finally agreed to accept financial direction from the House of Rothschild.\"47 __________________________ 46 Ignatius Balla, The Romance of the Rothschilds, Everleigh Nash, London, 1913"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 74 * The New York Times, April 1, 1915 reported that i n 1914, Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild went to court to suppress Ignatius Ba lla’s book on the grounds that the Waterloo story about his grandfather was u ntrue and libelous.

The New York Times noted in t his story that \"The total Rothschild wealth has been estimated at $2 billion. \" A previous story in The New York Times (May 27, 1905) noted that Baron Alph onse de Rothschild, head of the French house of Rothschild, possessed $ 60 million in American securities in his fortune, although the Rothschilds reputedly were not active in the American field. This explains why their agen t, J.P. Morgan, had only $19 million in securities in his estate when he die d in 1913, and securities handled by Morgan were actually owned by his employ er, Rothschild.\" 47 Richard Lewinsohn, The Profits of War, E.P. Dutt on, 1937 After the success of his Waterloo exploit, Nathan M ayer Rothschild gained control of the Bank of England through his near mon opoly of \"Consols\" and other shares. Several \"central\" banks, or banks whi ch had the power to issue currency, had been started in Europe: The Bank of S weden, in 1656, which began to issue notes in 1661, the earliest being th e Bank of Amsterdam, which financed Oliver Cromwell’s seizure of power i n England in 1649, ostensibly because of religious differences. Cromwe ll died in 1657 and the throne of England was re-established when Charles I I was crowned in 1660. He died in 1685. In 1689, the same group of bankers regained power in England by putting King William of Orange on the th rone. He soon repaid his backers by ordering the British Treasury to bor row 1,250,000 pounds from these bankers. He also issued them a Royal Cha rter for the Bank of England, which permitted them to consolidate the Na tional debt (which had just been created by this loan) and to secure payme nts of interest and principal by direct taxation of the people. The Cha rter forbade private goldsmiths to store gold and to issue receipts, whi ch gave the stockholders of the Bank of England a money monopoly. The goldsmith s also were required to store their gold in the Bank of England vaults. Not only had their privilege of issuing circulating medium been taken away by go vernment decree, but their fortunes were now turned over to those who ha d supplanted them.* In his \"Cantos\", 46; 27, Ezra Pound refers to the u nique privileges which William Paterson advertised in his prospectus for t he Charter of the Bank of England: \"Said Paterson Hath benefit of interest on all the moneys which it, the bank, creates out of nothi ng.\" The \"nothing\" which is referred to, of course, is t he bookkeeping operation of the bank, which \"creates\" money by entering a no tation that it has \"lent\""},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 75 you one thousand dollars, money which did not exist until the bank made the entry. By 1698, the British Treasury owed 16 million pound s sterling to the Bank of England. By 1815, principally due to the compoundin g of interest, the debt had risen to 885 million pounds sterling. Some of t his increase was due to the wars which had flourished during that period, inclu ding the Napoleonic Wars and the wars which England had fought to retai n its American Colony. __________________________ * NOTE: In the United States, after the stockholder s of the Federal Reserve System had consolidated their power in 1934, our go vernment also issued orders that private citizens could not store or hol d gold. William Paterson (1658-1719) himself benefited litt le from \"the moneys which the bank creates out of nothing\", as he withd rew, after a policy disagreement, from the Bank of England a year after it was founded. A later William Paterson became one of the framers of the U nited States Constitution, while the name lingers on, like the p ernicious central bank itself. Paterson had found himself unable to work with the Bank of England’s stockholders. Many of them remained anonymous, but an early description of the Bank of England stated it was \"A society of about 1330 persons, including the King and Queen of England, who had 10 ,000 pounds of stock, the Duke of Leeds, Duke of Devonshire, Earl of Pemb roke, and the Earl of Bradford.\" Because of his success in his speculations, Baron N athan Mayer de Rothschild, as he now called himself, reigned as th e supreme financial power in London. He arrogantly exclaimed, during a party in his mansion, \"I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of Englan d to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man that controls Bri tain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the Brit ish money supply.\" His brother James in Paris had also achieved domina nce in French finance. In Baron Edmond de Rothschild, David Druck writes, \"(James) Rothschild’s wealth had reached the 600 million mark. Only one m an in France possessed more. That was the King, whose wealth was 800 milli on. The aggregate wealth of all the bankers in France was 150 million less than that of James Rothschild.

Thus, the En glish royal House of Windsor has a direct family relationship to the Rot hschilds. In 1901, when Queen Victoria’s son, Edward, became King Edward VI I, he re-established the Rothschild ties. Paul Emden in Behind The Throne says, \"Edward’s preparation for his metier was quite diff erent from that of his mother, hence he ‘ruled’ less than she did. Gratefully, he retained around him men who had been with him in the age of the building of the Baghdad Railw ay...there were added to the advisory staff Leopold and Alfred de Rothschild, various members of the Sassoon family, and above all his private financial advisor Sir Ernest Cassel .\"50 The enormous fortune which Cassel made in a relativ ely short time gave him an immense power which he never misus ed.

Not until numerous diplomatic publications appeared in the years after the war did a wider public learn how strongly Alfred de Rothschild’s hand affected the politics o f Central Europe during the twenty years before the war (Worl d War I).\" With the control of the money came the control of t he news media. Kent Cooper, head of the Associated Press, writes in his autobiography, Barriers Down, \"International bankers under the House of Rothschil d acquired an interest in the three leading European agencies.\"51 Thus the Rothschilds bought control of Reuters Inte rnational News Agency, based in London, Havas of France, and Wolf in Germa ny, which controlled the dissemination of all news in Europe. __________________________ 50 Paul Emden, Behind The Throne, Hoddard Stoughton , London, 1934 51 Kent Cooper, Barriers Down, pg. 21 In Inside Europe52, John Gunther wrote in 1936 that any French prime minister, at the end of 1935, was a creature of the financial oligarchy, and that this financial oligarchy was dominated by twel ve regents, of whom six were bankers, and were headed by Baron Edmond de Ro thschild. The iron grip of the \"London Connection\" on the med ia was exposed in a recent book by Ben J.

In 1775, the colonists of America declared their in dependence from Great Britain, and subsequently won their freedom by the American Revolution. Although they achieved political freedom, financial independence proved to be a more difficult matter. In 1791, Alexander Hami lton, at the behest of European bankers, formed the first Bank of the Unit ed States, a central bank with much the same powers as the Bank of England. T he foreign influences behind this bank, more than a century later, were a ble to get the Federal Reserve Act through Congress, giving them at last t he central bank of issue for our economy. Although the Federal Reserve Bank was neither Federal, being owned by private stockholders, nor a Reserve, because it was intended to create money, instead of to hold it in reserve, it did achieve enormous financial power, so much so that it has gradually s uperseded the popular elected government of the United States. Through th e Federal Reserve System, American independence was stealthily but in vincibly absorbed back into the British sphere of influence. Thus the Lond on Connection became the arbiter of policy of the United States. Because of England’s loss of her colonial empire af ter the Second World War, it seemed that her influence as a world politi cal power was waning. Essentially, this was true. The England of 1980 is not the England of 1880. She no longer rules the waves; she is a second rate , perhaps third rate, military power, but paradoxically, as her political and military power waned, her financial power grew. In Capital City we find, \"On almost any measure you care to take, London is the world’s leading fin ancial centre . . . In the 1960s London dominance increased . . .\"56 A partial explanation of this fact is given: \"Daniel Davison, head of London’s Morgan Grenfell, said, ‘The American banks have brought the necessary money, customers, capital __________________________ 55 Coningsby, by Disraeli, Longmans Co., London, 18 81, p. 252 56 McRae and Cairncross, Capital City, Eyre Methuen , London, 1963, p. 1"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 80 and skills which have established London in its pre sent preeminence . . . . only the American banks have a lender of last resort.

Without them, London would not be credible as an in ternational financial centre.’\"57 Thus London is the world’s financial center, becaus e it can command enormous sums of capital, created at its command by the Federal Reserve Board of the United States. But how is this possibl e? We have already established that the monetary policies of the Unite d States, the interest rates, the volume and value of money, and sales of bonds, are decided, not by the figurehead of the Federal Reserve Board of Governor s, but by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The pretended decentraliz ation of the Federal Reserve System and its twelve, equally autonomous \" regional\" banks, is and has been a deception since the Federal Reserve Act became law in 1913. That United States monetary policy stems solely from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is yet another fallacy. That the Federal R eserve Bank of New York is itself autonomous, and free to set monetary poli cy for the entire United States without any outside interference is especial ly untrue. We might believe in this autonomy if we did not kno w that the majority stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was purchas ed by three New York City banks: First National Bank, National City Bank , and the National Bank of Commerce. An examination of the principal stockh olders in these banks, in 1914, and today, reveals a direct London connect ion. In 1812, the National City Bank began business as t he City Bank, in the same room in which the defunct Bank of the United States , whose charter had expired, had been doing business. It represented ma ny of the same stockholders, who were now functioning under a legi timate American charter. During the early 1800s, the most famous na me associated with City Bank was Moses Taylor (1806-1882). Taylor’s father had been a confidential agent employed in buying property for the Astor int erests while concealing the fact that Astor was the purchaser. Through this tactic, Astor succeeded in buying many farms, and also a great deal of potenti ally valuable real estate in Manhattan. Although Astor’s capital was reputed to come from his fur trading, a number of sources indicate that he also represented foreign interests. LaRouche58 states that Astor, in exchang e for providing intelligence to the British during the years before and after the Revolutionary War, and for inciting Indians to atta ck __________________________"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 81 57 Ibid, p. 225 58 Lyndon H.

He was not paid cash, but was given a percentage of the British opium trade with China. It was the income from this lucrative c oncession which provided the basis for the Astor fortune. With his father’s connection with the Astors, young Moses Taylor had no difficulty in finding a place as apprentice in a ba nking house at the age of 15. Like so many others in these pages, he found his gr eatest opportunities when many other Americans were going bankrupt during an abrupt contraction of credit. During the Panic of 1837, when more than ha lf the business firms in New York failed, he doubled his fortune. In 1855, h e became president of City Bank. During the Panic of 1857, the City Bank profited by the failure of many of its competitors. Like George Peabody and Ju nius Morgan, Taylor seemed to have an ample supply of cash for buying u p distressed stocks. He purchased nearly all the stock of Delaware Lackawan na Railroad for $5 a share. Seven years later, it was selling for $240 a share. Moses Taylor was now worth fifty million dollars. In August, 1861, Taylor was named Chairman of the L oan Committee to finance the Union Government in the Civil War. The Committee shocked Lincoln by offering the government $5,000,000 at 12 % to finance the war. Lincoln refused and financed the war by issuing the famous \"Greenbacks\" through the U.S. Treasury, which were backed by gol d. Taylor continued to increase his fortune throughout the war, and in his later years, the youthful James Stillman became his protégé. In 1882, when Mo ses Taylor died, he left seventy million dollars.* His son-in-law, Percy Pyn e, succeeded him as president of City Bank, which had now become Nation al City Bank. Pyne was paralyzed, and was barely able to function at t he bank. For nine years, the bank stagnated, nearly all its capital being th e estate of Moses Taylor. William Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller , had bought into the bank, and was anxious to see it progress. He persua ded Pyne to step aside in 1891 in favor of James Stillman, and soon the Natio nal City Bank became the principal repository of the Rockefeller oil income. William Rockefeller’s son, William, married Elsie, James Stillman’s daughter, Isabel. Like so many others in New York banking, James Stillman also had a British connection.

Henry Schroder Banking Company is listed as Numb er 2 in capitalization in Capital City62 on the list of the seventeen merc hant bankers who make up the exclusive Accepting Houses Committee in London. Although it is almost unknown in the United States, it has played a large part in our history. Like the others on this list, it had first to be approve d by the Bank of England. And, like the Warburg family, the von Schroders beg an their banking operations in Hamburg, Germany. At the turn of the century, in 1900, Baron Bruno von Schroder established the London branch of the firm. He was soon joined by Frank Cyril Tiarks, in 1902. Tiarks marri ed Emma Franziska of Hamburg, and was a director of the Bank of England from 1912 to 1945. During World War I, J. Henry Schroder Banking Compa ny played an important role behind the scenes. No historian has a reasonable explanation of how World War I started. Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated at Sarajevo by Gavril Princeps, Austria demanded an ap ology from Serbia, and Serbia sent the note of apology. Despite this, Aust ria declared war, and soon the other nations of Europe joined the fray. Once t he war had gotten started, it was found that it wasn’t easy to keep it going. The principal problem was that Germany was desperately short of food and coal , and without Germany, the war could not go on. John Hamill in The Strange Career of Mr. Hoover63 explains how the problem was solved.* He q uotes from Nordeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, March 4, 1915, \"Jus tice, however, demands that publicity should be given to the preem inent part taken by the German authorities in Belgium in the solution of th is problem. The initiative came from them and it was only due to their continu ous relations with the American Relief Committee that the provisioning que stion was solved.\" Hamill points out \"That is what the Belgian Relief Committee was organized for--to keep Germany in food.\" The Belgian Relief Commission was organized by Emil e Francqui, director of a large Belgian bank, Societe Generale, and a Lo ndon mining __________________________ 62 McRae and Cairncross, Capital City, Eyre Methuen , London, 1963 63 John Hamill, The Strange Career of Mr. Hoover, W illiam Faro, New York, 1931 * Copies of Hamill’s book were systematically locat ed and destroyed by government agents, because it was published on the eve of President Hoover’s re-election campaign."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 87 promoter, an American named Herbert Hoover, who had been associated with Francqui in a number of scandals which had become c elebrated court cases, notably the Kaiping Coal Company scandal in China, said to have set off the Boxer Rebellion, which had as its goal the expulsio n of all foreign businessmen from China. Hoover had been barred from dealing on the London Stock Exchange because of one judgement agai nst him, and his associate, Stanley Rowe, had been sent to prison fo r ten years. With this background, Hoover was called an ideal choice for a career in humanitarian work. Although his name is unknown in the United States, Emile Francqui was the guiding spirit behind Herbert Hoover’s rise to fort une. Hamill (on page 156) identifies Francqui as the director of many atrocit ies committed against natives in the Congo. \"For every cartridge they spe nt, they had to bring in a man’s hand\". Francqui’s frightful record may have b een the source for the charge later leveled against German soldiers in Bel gium, that they chopped off the hands of women and children, a claim which proved to be groundless. Hamill also says that Francqui \"tricked the America ns out of the Hankow- Canton railroad concession in China in 1901, and at the same time had ‘stood by’ in case Hoover needed any further help i n the ‘taking’ of the Kaiping coal mines. This is the humanitarian who ha d sole charge of the distribution of the Belgian ‘relief’ during the Wor ld War, for which Hoover did the buying and shipping. Francqui was a directo r with Hoover, in the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company (the Kaiping mines), through which Hoover transported 200,000 Chinese slave work ers to the Congo to work Francqui’s copper mines.\" Hamill says on page 311 that \"Francqui opened the o ffices of the Belgian Relief in his bank, Societe Generale, as a one-man show, with a letter of permission from the German Governor General von der Goltz dated October 16, 1914. The New York Herald Tribune of February 18, 1930, q uoted by Congressman Louis McFadden in the House on February 26, 1930, said, \"One of Belgium’s two directors on the Bank for Int ernational Settlements will be Emile Francqui of the Societe Generale, a m ember of both the Young and Dawes Plan Committees. The board of directors o f the international bank will have no more colorful character than Emil e Francqui, former Minister of Finance, veteran of the Congo and China . . . he is rated as the richest man in Belgium, and among the twelve riches t men in Europe.\" Despite his prominence, The New York Times Index me ntions Francqui only a few times during two decades before his death. On October 3, 1931, The New York Times quoted Le Peuple of Brussels that Fr ancqui would visit the United States. \"As a friend of President Hoover, Mo nsieur Francqui will not fail to pay a visit to the President.\""},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 88 On October 30, 1931, The New York Times reported th is visit with the headline, \"Hoover-Francqui Talk was Unofficial\". \"It was stat ed that Mr. Francqui spent Tuesday night as a personal guest of the Pres ident, and that they talked of world financial problems in general, strictly un official. Mr. Francqui was an associate of President Hoover during the latters ministrations in Belgium during the war. Their visit had no official signifi cance. Mr. Francqui is a private citizen and not engaged in any official mis sion.\" No reference is made to the Hoover-Francqui busines s associations which were the subject of huge lawsuits in London. The Fr ancqui visit probably involved Hoover’s Moratorium on German War Debts, w hich stunned the financial world. On December 15, 1931, Chairman McF adden informed the House of a dispatch in the Public Ledger of Philade lphia, October 24, 1931, \"GERMAN REVEALS HOOVER’S SECRET. The American Presi dent was in intimate negotiations with the German government regarding a year’s debt holiday as early as December, 1930.\" McFadden continued, \"Behind the Hoover announcement there were many months of hurri ed and furtive preparations both in Germany and in Wall Street off ices of German bankers. Germany, like a sponge, had to be saturated with Am erican money. Mr. Hoover himself had to be elected, because this sche me began before he became President. If the German international banke rs of Wall Street--that is Kuhn Loeb Company, J. & W. Seligman, Paul W arburg, J. Henry Schroder--and their satellites had not had this job waiting to be done, Herbert Hoover would never have been elected Presid ent of the United States. The election of Mr. Hoover to the Presidenc y was through the influence of the Warburg Brothers, directors of the great bank of Kuhn Loeb Company, who carried the cost of his election. In e xchange for this collaboration Mr. Hoover promised to impose the mor atorium of German debts. Hoover sought to exempt Kreuger’s loan to Ge rmany of $125 million from the operation of the Hoover Moratorium. The na ture of Kreuger’s swindle was known here in January when he visited h is friend, Mr. Hoover, in the White House.\" Not only did Hoover entertain Francqui in the White House, but also Ivar Kreuger, the most famous swindler of the twentieth century. When Francqui died on November 13, 1935, The New Yo rk Times memorialized him as \"the copper king of the Congo . . . Mr. Francqui, last year having gained dictatorial powers over the belg a, maintained it on the gold standard during a crisis. In 1891 he led an ex pedition into the Congo and gained it for King Leopold. A man of great weal th, rated among the twelve richest men in Europe, he secured enormous c opper deposits. He was Minister of State in 1926 and Minister of Finance i n 1934. It was his pride that he never accepted a centime of remuneration fo r his services to the government. While consul general at Shanghai, he se cured valuable concessions, notably the Kaiping coal mines and the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 89 railway concession for the Tientsin Railroad. He wa s governor of the Societe Generale de Belgique, Lloyd Royal Belge, and regent of La Banque Nationale de Belgique.\" The Times does not mention Francqui’s business part nerships with Hoover. Like Francqui, Hoover also refused remuneration for \"government service\", and as Secretary of Commerce and as President of th e United States, he turned his salary back to the government. On December 13, 1932, Chairman McFadden introduced a resolution of impeachment against President Hoover for high crime s and misdemeanors, which covers many pages, including violation of con tracts, unlawful dissipation of the financial resources of the Unite d States, and his appointment of Eugene Meyer to the Federal Reserve Board. The resolution was tabled and never acted upon by the House. In criticizing Hoover’s Moratorium of German War De bts, McFadden had referred to Hoover’s \"German\" backers. Although all of the principals of \"the London Connection\" did originate in Germany, m ost of them in Frankfurt, at the time they sponsored Hoover’s cand idacy for the Presidency of the United States, they were operating from Lond on, as Hoover himself had done for most of his career. Also, the Hoover Moratorium was not intended to \"he lp\" Germany, as Hoover had never been \"pro-German\". The Moratorium on Germany’s war debts was necessary so that Germany would have fund s for rearming. In 1931, the truly forward-looking diplomats were anti cipating the Second World War, and there could be no war without an \"ag gressor\". Hoover had also carried out a number of mining prom otions in various parts of the world as a secret agent for the Rothschilds, and had been rewarded with a directorship in one of the principal Rothsch ild enterprises, the Rio Tinto Mines in Spain and Bolivia. Francqui and Hoov er threw themselves into the seemingly impossible task of provisioning Germany during the First World War. Their success was noted in Nordeutsche A llgemeine Zeitung, March 13, 1915, which noted that large quantities o f food were now arriving from Belgium by rail. Schmoller’s Yearbook for Legi slation, Administration and Political Economy for 1916, shows that one bill ion pounds of meat, one and a half billion pounds of potatoes, one and a ha lf billion pounds of bread, and one hundred twenty-one millions pounds of butte r had been shipped from Belgium to Germany in that year. A patriotic B ritish woman who had operated a small hospital in Belgium for several ye ars, Edith Cavell, wrote to the Nursing Mirror in London, April 15, 1915, compl aining that the \"Belgian Relief\" supplies were being shipped to Germany to f eed the German army. The Germans considered Miss Cavell to be of no impo rtance, and paid no attention to her, but the British Intelligence Serv ice in London was appalled"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 90 by Miss Cavell’s discovery, and demanded that the G ermans arrest her as a spy. Sir William Wiseman, head of British Intelligence, and partner of Kuhn Loeb Company, feared that the continuance of the wa r was at stake, and secretly notified the Germans that Miss Cavell must be executed. The Germans reluctantly arrested her and charged her wi th aiding prisoners of war to escape. The usual penalty for this offense w as three months imprisonment, but the Germans bowed to Sir William Wiseman’s demands, and shot Edith Cavell, thus creating one of the pri ncipal martyrs of the First World War. With Edith Cavell out of the way, the \"Belgian Reli ef\" operation continued, although in 1916, German emissaries again approache d London officials with the information that they did not believe Germ any could continue military operations, not only because of food short ages, but because of financial problems. More \"emergency relief\" was sen t, and Germany continued in the war until November, 1918. Two of H oover’s principal assistants were a former lumber shipping clerk from the West Coast, Prentiss Gray, and Julius H. Barnes, a grain salesm an from Duluth. Both men became partners in J. Henry Schroder Banking Co rporation in New York after the war, and amassed large fortunes, pri ncipally in grain and sugar. With the entry of the United States into the war, B arnes and Gray were given important posts in the newly created U.S. Food Admi nistration, which also was placed under Herbert Hoover’s direction. Barnes became President of the Grain Corporation of the U.S. Food Administrati on from 1917 to 1918, and Gray was chief of Marine Transportation. Anothe r J. Henry Schroder partner, G. A. Zabriskie, was named head of the U.S . Sugar Equalization Board. Thus the London Connection controlled all fo od in the United States through its grain and sugar \"Czars\" during the Firs t World War. Despite many complaints of corruption and scandal in the U. S. Food Administration, no one was ever indicted. After the war, the partne rs of J. Henry Schroder Company found that they now owned most of Cuba’s su gar industry. One partner, M.E. Rionda, was president of Cuba Cane Co rporation, and director of Manati Sugar Company, American British and Continental Corporation, and other firms. Baron Bruno von Schro der, senior partner of the firm, was a director of North British and Merca ntile Insurance Company. His father, Baron Rudolph von Schroder of Hamburg, was a director of Sao Paulo Coffee Ltd., one of the large st Brazilian coffee companies, with F.C. Tiarks, also of the Schroder f irm.* __________________________ * The New York Times noted on October 11, 1923: \"Fr ank C.

As his principal assistant in the U.S. Food Adminis tration, Hoover chose Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss, who was soon to become a partner in Kuhn Loeb Company, marrying the daughter of Jerome Hanauer of Kuhn Loeb. Throughout his distinguished humanitarian service w ith the Belgian Relief Commission, the U.S. Food Administration, and, afte r the war, the American Relief Administration, Hoover’s closest associate w as one Edgar Rickard, born in Pontgibaud, France. In Who’s Who, he states that he was \"World War administrative assistant to Herbert Hoover in a ll war and post-war organizations including the Commission For Relief i n Belgium. He also served on the U.S. Food Administration from 1914-19 24.\" He remained one of Hoover’s closest friends, and usually the Rickar ds and Hoovers took their vacations together. After Hoover became Secretary o f Commerce under Coolidge, Hamill tells us that Hoover awarded his f riend the Hazeltine Radio patents, which paid him one million dollars a year in royalties. In 1928, \"the London Connection\" decided to run Her bert Hoover for president of the United States. There was only one problem; although Herbert Hoover had been born in the United States, and was thus eligible for the office of the presidency, according to the Cons titution, he had never had a business address or a home address in the United States, as he had gone abroad just after completing college at Stanford. T he result was that during his campaign for the presidency, Herbert Hoover lis ted as his American address Suite 2000, 42 Broadway, New York, which wa s the office of Edgar Rickard. Suite 2000 was also shared by the grain ty coon and partner of J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation, Julius H. Barne s. After Herbert Hoover was elected president of the U nited States, he insisted on appointing one of the old London crowd, Eugene M eyer, as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Meyer’s father had been one of the partners of Lazard Freres of Paris, and Lazard Brothers of Lond on. Meyer, with Baruch, had been one of the most powerful men in th e United States during World War I, a member of the famous Triumvirate whi ch exercised unequalled power; Meyer as Chairman of the War Fina nce Corporation, Bernard Baruch as Chairman of the War Industries Bo ard, and Paul Warburg as Governor of the Federal Reserve System. A longtime critic of Eugene Meyer, Chairman Louis M cFadden of the House Banking and Currency Committee, was quoted in The N ew York Times, December 17, 1930, as having made a speech on the f loor of the House attacking Hoover’s appointment of Meyer, and chargi ng that \"He"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 92 represents the Rothschild interest and is liaison o fficer between the French Government and J.P.

The speech was incoherent, as Mr. McFadden’s speech es usually are.\" As The Times predicted, Meyer was duly approved by the Senate. Not content with having a friend in the White House , J. Henry Schroder Corporation was soon embarked on further internatio nal adventures, nothing less than a plan to set up World War II. Th is was to be done by providing, at a crucial juncture, the financing for Adolf Hitler’s assumption of power in Germany. Although any number of magnate s have been given credit for the financing of Hitler, including Fritz Thyssen, Henry Ford, and J.P. Morgan, they, as well as others, did provide m illions of dollars for his political campaigns during the 1920s, just as they did for others who also had a chance of winning, but who disappeared and were n ever heard from again. In December of 1932, it seemed inevitable to many o bservers of the German scene that Hitler was also ready for a toboggan sli de into oblivion. Despite the fact that he had done well in national campaign s, he had spent all the money from his usual sources and now faced heavy de bts. In his book Aggression, Otto Lehmann-Russbeldt tells us that \"H itler was invited to a meeting at the Schroder Bank in Berlin on January 4 , 1933. The leading industrialists and bankers of Germany tided Hitler over his financial difficulties and enabled him to meet the enormous d ebt he had incurred in connection with the maintenance of his private army . In return, he promised to break the power of the trade unions. On May 2, 1 933, he fulfilled his promise.\"64 Present at the January 4, 1933 meeting were the Dul les brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen W. Dulles of the New York law firm , Sullivan and Cromwell, which represented the Schroder Bank. The Dulles brothers often turned up at important meetings. They had represent ed the United States at the Paris Peace Conference (1919); John Foster Dull es would die in harness as Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, while Allen Dul les headed the Central Intelligence Agency for many years. Their apologist s have seldom attempted to defend the Dulles brothers appearance at the mee ting which installed Hitler as the Chancellor of Germany, preferring to pretend that it never happened.

Henry Sc hroder Company. Neither he nor J. Henry Schroder were to be suspected of be ing pro-Nazi or pro- Hitler; the inescapable fact was that if Hitler did not become Chancellor of Germany, there was little likelihood of getting a S econd World War going, the war which would double their profits.* The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia states \"The banking house Schroder Bros.

The New York branch of Schroder had been m erged in 1936 with the Rockefellers, as Schroder, Rockefeller, Inc. at 48 Wall Street. Carlton P. Fuller of Schroder was president of this firm, and Avery Rockefeller was vice-president. He had been a behind the scenes par tner of J.

J. Henry Schroder WAS the Anglo-German Fellowship, the English equivalent of the America First movement, and also attracting patriots who did not wish to see their nation involved in a needless war with Germany. During the 1930’s, until the outbreak of World War II, the Schroders poured mone y into the Anglo- German Fellowship, with the result that Hitler was convinced he had a large pro-German fifth column in England composed of many prominent politicians and financiers. The two divergent polit ical groups in the 1930’s in England were the War Party, led by Winston Churchil l, who furiously demanded that England go to war against Germany, an d the Appeasement Party, led by Neville Chamberlain.

It was not only Chamberlain, but also Hitler, who came away from Mu nich believing that it would be \"Peace in our time.\" The success of the Schroders in duping Hitler into this belief explains several of the most puzzling questions of World War II. Why did Hitler allow the British Army to decamp from Dunkirk and return home , when he could have wiped them out? Against the frantic advice of his g enerals, who wished to deliver the coup de grace to the English Army, Hitl er held back because he did not wish to alienate his supposed vast followin g in England.

Although he appears for the first time in Who’s Who in America for 1952, Mr. Simpson states that he served under Herbert Hoover on the Commission for Relief in Belgium from 1915 to 1917; U.S. Food Administration, 1917 to 1918, American Relief Commission, 1919, and with P.N.

He also became a partner of Schroder-Rocke feller Company when that investment trust backed a construction company which became the world’s largest, the firm of Bechtel Incorporated.

A strange sequence of event s, none of which were accidental, had occurred. Without Theodore Roosevel t’s \"Bull Moose\" candidacy, the popular President Taft would have be en reelected, and Woodrow Wilson would have returned to obscurity.* I f Wilson had not been elected, we might have had no Federal Reserve Act, and World War One could have been avoided. The European nations had b een led to maintain large standing armies as the policy of the central banks which dictated their governmental decisions. In April, 1887, the Quarter ly Journal of Economics had pointed out: \"A detailed revue of the public debts of Europe sho ws interest and sinking fund payments of $5,343 million annually (five and one-third billion ). M. Neymarck’s conclusion is much like Mr. Atkinson’s. The finances of Europe are so involved that the governments may ask whether war, with all its terrible chances, is not preferable to the maintenance of such a precarious and costly peace. If the military preparations of Europe do no t end in war, they may well end in the bankruptcy of the States. Or, if such follies lead neither to war nor to ruin, then they assuredly point to industrial and economic revolution.\" From 1887 to 1914, this precarious system of heavil y armed but bankrupt European nations endured, while the United States c ontinued to be a debtor nation, borrowing money from abroad, but making few international loans, because we did not have a central bank or \"mobiliza tion of credit\". The system of national loans developed by the Rothschil ds served to finance European struggles during the nineteenth century, b ecause they were spread out over Rothschild branches in several countries. By 1900, it was obvious that the European countries could not afford a majo r war. They had large standing armies, universal military service, and mo dern weapons, but their economies could not support the enormous expenditur es.

The American people were driven to ma ke war on the German people, with whom we had no conceivable poli tical or economic quarrel. Moreover, the United States comprised the largest nation in the world composed of Germans; almost half of its citiz ens were of German descent, and by a narrow margin, German had been vo ted down as the national language.* The German Ambassador to Turkey , baron Wangeheim asked the American Ambassador to Turkey, Henry Morg enthau, why the United States intended to make war in Germany. \"We Americans,\" replied Morgenthau, speaking for the group of Harlem real e state operators of which he was the head, \"are going to war for a moral prin ciple.\" J.P. Morgan received the proceeds of the First Liberty Loan to pay off $400,000,000 which he advanced to Great Britain at the outset of the w ar. To cover this loan, $68,000,000 in notes had been issued under the prov isions of the Aldrich- Vreeland Act for issuing notes against securities, the only time this provision was employed. The notes were retired as soon as the Federal Reserve Banks began operation, and replaced by Federal Reserve No tes. During 1915 and 1916, Wilson kept faith with the ba nkers who had purchased the White House for him, by continuing to make loans to the Allies. His Secretary of State, William Jennings Br yan, protested constantly, stating that \"Money is the worst of all contraband. \" By 1917, the Morgans and Kuhn, Loeb Company had floated a billion and a half dollars in loans to the Allies. The bankers also financed a host of \"pe ace\" organizations which worked to get us involved in the World War. The Com mission for Relief in Belgium manufactured atrocity stories against the G ermans, while a Carnegie organization, The League to Enforce Peace, agitated in Washington for our entry into war. This later became the Carne gie Endowment for International Peace, which during the 1940s was hea ded by Alger Hiss. One writer* claimed that he had never seen any \"peace m ovement\" which did not end in war. The U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Walter Hines Page, complained that he could not afford the position, and was given twenty -five thousand dollars a year spending money by Cleveland H.

Acc ording to Under Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ameri ca’s heavy industry had been preparing for war for a year. Both the Army an d Navy Departments had been purchasing war supplies in large amounts s ince early in 1916. Cordell Hull remarks in his Memoirs: \"The conflict forced the further development of the income-tax principle. Aiming, as it did, at the one great untaxed source of revenue, the income-tax law had been enacted in the nick of time to meet the demands of the war. And the conflict also assisted the putting into effect of the Federal Reserve System, likewise in the nick of time.\"70 One may ask, in the nick of time for whom? Certainl y not for the American people, who had no need for \"mobilization of credit \" for a European war, or to enact an income tax to finance a war. Hull’s sta tement affords a rare glimpse into the machinations of our \"public servan ts\".

The most demanding function of the centra l bank mechanism is war finance. On October 13, 1917, Woodrow Wilson made a major ad dress, stating: \"It is manifestly imperative that there should be a complete mobilization of the banking reserves of the United States. The burden and the privilege (of the Allied loans) must be shared by every banking institution in the country.

In Wilson’s War Message in 1917, he included an inc redible tribute to the Communists in Russia who were busily slaughtering t he middle class in that unfortunate country. \"Assurance has been added to our hope for the futur e peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening in the l ast few weeks in Russia.

Baruch wa s appointed head of the War Industries Board, with life and death po wers over every factory in the United States. Eugene Meyer was appointed head of the War Finance Corporation, in charge of the loan program which fi nanced the war. Paul Warburg was in control of the nation’s banking syst em*. Knowing that the overwhelming sentiment of the Amer ican people during 1915 and 1916 had been anti-British and pro-German, our British allies viewed with some trepidation the prominence of Paul Warburg and Kuhn, Loeb Company in the prosecution of the war. They we re uneasy about his high position in the Administration because his bro ther, Max Warburg, was at that time serving as head of the German Secret S ervice. On December 12, 1918, the United States Naval Secret Service Report on Mr. Warburg was as follows: \"WARBURG, PAUL: New York City. German, naturalized citizen, 1911. was decorated by the Kaiser in 1912, was vice chairman of the Federal Re serve Board. Handled large sums furnished by Germany for Lenin and Trotsky.

AFTER the Armistice had been signed. Also, it does not contain the information that Paul Warburg resigned from the Fed eral Reserve Board in May, 1918, which indicates that it was compiled bef ore May, 1918, when Paul Warburg would theoretically have been open to a cha rge of treason because of his brother’s control of Germany’s Secret Servic e.

This was not a circumstance to be taken lightly, as on neither side of the Atlantic were the said banke rs obscure individuals who had no influence in the conduct of the war. On the contrary, the Kuhn, Loeb partners held the highest governmental posts in the United States during World War I, while in Germany, Max and Fritz Warbur g, and Philip and Ludwig Schiff, moved in the highest councils of gov ernment. From Memoirs of Max Warburg, \"The Kaiser thumbed the table viole ntly and shouted, ‘Must you always be right?’ but then listened caref ully to Max’s view on financial matters.\"72 In June, 1918, Paul Warburg wrote a private note to Woodrow Wilson, \"I have two brothers in Germany who are bankers.

He worked most closely with Wilson’s alter ego, Col.

Ten months b efore the election which returned Wilson to the White House in 1916 ‘because he kept us out of war’, Col. House negotiated a secret agreement with Engla nd and France on behalf of Wilson which pledged the United States to interv ene on behalf of the Allies. On March 9, 1916, Wilson formally sanctione d the undertaking.76 Nothing could more forcefully illustrate the duplic ity of Woodrow Wilson’s nature than his nationwide campaign on the slogan, \"He kept us out of war\", when he had pledged ten months earlier to involve u s in the war on the side of England and France.

In any case, he did not leave the F ederal Reserve Administration, as he immediately took over J.P.

This banking house had large interests in Cuba and South America, and played a prominent part in financing the many revolutions in those countries. Its most notor ious publicity came during the Senate Finance Committee’s investigation in 1933, when it was brought out that J & W Seligman had given a $415,00 0 bribe to Juan Leguia, son of the President of Peru, in order to get that nation to accept a loan. A partial list of Albert Strauss’ directorships, ac cording to \"Who’s Who\", shows that he was: Chairman of the Board of the Cub a Cane Sugar Corporation; director, Brooklyn Manhattan Transit C o., Coney Island Brooklyn RR, New York Rapid Transit, Pierce-Arrow, Cuba Tobacco Corporation, and the Eastern Cuba Sugar Corporation . Governor Delano resigned in August, 1918, to be com missioned a Colonel in the Army. The war ended on November 11, 1918. William McAdoo was replaced in 1918 by Carter Glass as Secretary of the Treasury. Both Strauss and Glass were present durin g the secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board on May 18, 1920, when the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21 was made possible. One of the main lies about the Federal Reserve Act when it was being ballyhooed in 1913 was its promise to take care of the farmer. Actually, it has never taken care of anybody but a few big bankers. Prof. O.M.W. Sprague, Harvard economist, writing in the Quarterly Journal of Economics of February, 1914, said: \"The primary purpose of the Federal Reserve Act is to make sure that there will always be an available supply of money and credit in this countr y to meet unusual banking requirements.\" There is nothing in that wording to help the farmer . The First World War had introduced into this countr y a general prosperity, as revealed by the stocks of heavy industry on the New York Exchange in 1917-1918, by the increase in the amount of money c irculated, and by the enormous bank clearings during the whole of 1918. I t was the assigned duty of the Federal Reserve System to get back the vast amount of money and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 125 credit which had escaped their control during this time of prosperity. This was done by the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21. The operations of the Federal Reserve Open Market C ommittee in 1917-18, while Paul Warburg was still Chairman, show a treme ndous increase in purchases of bankers’ and trade acceptances. There was also a great increase in the purchase of United States Government securit ies, under the leadership of the able Eugene Meyer, Jr. A large part of the s tock market speculation in 1919, at the end of the War when the market was ver y unsettled, was financed with funds borrowed from Federal Reserve B anks with Government securities as collateral. Thus the Feder al Reserve System set up the Depression, first by causing inflation, and the n raising the discount rate and making money dear. In 1914, Federal Reserve Bank rates had dropped fro m six percent to four percent, had gone to a further low of three percent in 1916, and had stayed at that level until 1920. The reason for the low inter est rate was the necessity for floating the billion dollar Liberty Loans. At the b eginning of each Liberty Loan Drive, the Federal Reserve Board put a hundred million dollars into the New York money market through its open market o perations, in order to provide a cash impetus for the drive. The most impo rtant role of the Liberty Bonds was to soak up the increase in circulation of the medium of exchange (integer of account) brought about by the large amo unt of currency and credit put out during the war. Laborers were paid h igh wages, and farmers received the highest prices for their produce they had ever known. These two groups accumulated millions of dollars in cash whic h they did not put into Liberty Bonds. That money was effectively out of th e hands of the Wall Street group which controlled the money and credit of the United States. They wanted it back, and that is why we had the Agr icultural Depression of 1920-21. Much of the money was deposited in small country ba nks in the Middle West and West which had refused to have any part of the Federal Reserve System, the farmers and ranchers of those regions seeing no good reason why they should give a group of international financiers con trol of their money. The main job of the Federal Reserve System was to break these small country banks and get back the money which had been paid ou t to the farmers during the war, in effect, ruin them, and this it p roceeded to do. First of all, a Federal Farm Loan Board was set up which encouraged the farmers to invest their accrued money in land on lo ng term loans, which the farmers were eager to do. Then inflation was allowe d to take its course in this country and in Europe in 1919 and 1920. The purpose of the inflation in Europe was to cancel out a large portion of the war debts owed by the Allies to the American people, and its purpose in this cou ntry was to draw in the excess moneys which had been distributed to"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 126 the working people in the form of higher wages and bonuses for production. As prices went higher and higher, the money which the workers had accumulated became worth less and less, inflicting upon them an unfair drain, while the propertied classes were enriched b y the inflation because of the enormous increase in the value of land and manu factured goods. The workers were thus effectively impoverished, but the farmers, who were as a class more thrifty, and who were more self-sufficie nt, had to be handled more harshly. G.W. Norris, in \"Collier’s Magazine\" of March 20, 1 920, said: \"Rumor has it that two members of the Federal Reser ve Board had a plain talk with some New York bankers and financiers in December, 1919. Imme diately afterwards, there was a notable decline in transactions on the stock market and a c essation of company promotions. It is understood that action in the same general directio n has already been taken in other sections of the country , as evidence of the abuse of the Federal Reserve System to promo te speculation in land and commodities appeared.\" Senator Robert L. Owen, Chairman of the Senate Bank ing and Currency Committee, testified at the Senate Silver Hearings in 1939 that: \"In the early part of 1920, the farmers were exceed ingly prosperous. They were paying off the mortgages and buying a lot of new land, at the inst ance of the Government-- had borrowed money to do it--and then they were bankrupted by a sudden contraction of credit and currency which took place in 1920. What took place in 1920 was jus t the reverse of what should have been taking place. Instead of liquidating the excess of credits created by the war through a period of years, the Federal Reserve Board met in a meeting which was no t disclosed to the public. They met on the 18th of May, 1920, and it was a secret meeting.

The Class C Directors, representing the people of the United States, were not present and were not invited to be present. Only the big bankers were there, and their work of that day resulted in a contraction of credit which had the effect the next year of reducing the national income fifteen billion dollars, throwing millions of people out of employment, and reducing the value of lands and ranches by twenty billion dollars.\" Carter Glass, member of the Board in 1920 as Secret ary of the Treasury, wrote in his autobiography, Adventure in Constructi ve Finance published in 1928; \"Reporters were not present, of course, as th ey should not have been and as they never are at any bank board meeting in the world.\"85 __________________________ 85 Carter Glass, Adventure in Constructive Finance, Doubleday, N.Y. 1928 It was Carter Glass who had complained that, if a s uggested amendment by Senator LaFollette were passed, on the Federal Rese rve Act of 1913, to the effect that no member of the Federal Reserve Board should be an official or director or stockholder of any bank, trust company, or insurance company, we would end up by having mechanics and farm labore rs on the Board. Certainly mechanics and farm laborers could have ca used no more damage to the country than did Glass, Strauss, and Warburg at the secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board. Senator Brookhart of Iowa testified that at that se cret meeting Paul Warburg, also President of the Federal Advisory Cou ncil, had a resolution passed to send a committee of five to the Interstat e Commerce Commission and ask for an increase in railroad rates.

After talki ng cooperation and standing around waiting for my trai n--I did not specifically mention cooperative banking, it wa s cooperation in general--a man called me off to one side and said, ‘I think Paul Warburg is the greatest financi er we have ever produced.

The purpose of the Board’s action was to break those state and joint land stock banks which had steadfastly refused to surrender their freedom to the banker’s dictatorship set up by the System. Kemmerer in the ABC of the Federal Reserve System had written in 1919 that: \"The tendency will be toward unification and simpli city which will be brought about by the state institutions, in increasing numbers, becoming stock holders and depositors in the reserve banks.\" However, the state banks had not responded. The Senate Hearings of 1923 investigating the cause s of the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21 had been demanded by the Amer ican people. The complete record of the secret meeting of the Federa l Reserve Board on May 18, 1920 had been printed in the \"Manufacturers’ Re cord\" of Baltimore, Maryland, a magazine devoted to the interests of sm all Southern manufacturers. Benjamin Strong, Governor of the Federal Reserve Ba nk of New York, and close friend of Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, claimed at these Hearings: \"The Federal Reserve System has done more for the f armer than he has yet begun to realize.\" Emmanuel Goldenweiser, Director of Research for the Board of Governors, claimed that the discount rate was raised purely as an anti-inflationary measure, but he failed to explain why it was a rais e aimed solely at farmers and workers, while at the same time the System prot ected the manufacturers and merchants by assuring them increased credits. The final statement on the Federal Reserve Board’s causing the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21 was made by William Jennings Bryan. In \"Hearst’s Magazine\" of November, 1923, he wrote:"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 130 \"The Federal Reserve Bank that should have been the farmer’s greatest protection has become his greatest foe.

The unidentified writer, perhaps Paul Warburg, stated, \"The Federal Reserve is a fount of credit, not of capital.\" This is one of the most revealing stat ements ever made about the Federal Reserve System. It says that the Federal Re serve System will never add anything to our capital structure, or to the fo rmation of capital, because it is organized to produce credit, to create money for credit money and speculations, instead of providing capital funds fo r the improvement of commerce and industry. Simply stated, capitalizatio n would mean the providing of notes backed by a precious metal or ot her commodity. Reserve notes are unbacked paper loaned at interest. On July 25, 1921, Senator Owen stated on the editor ial page of The New York Times, The Federal Reserve Board is the most g igantic financial power in all the world. Instead of using this great power as the Federal Reserve Act intended that it should, the board....delegated thi s power to the banks, threw the weight of its influence toward the support of t he policy of German inflation.\" The senator whose name was on the Act s aw that it was not performing as promised. After the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21, the F ederal Reserve Board of Governors settled down to eight years of providing rapid credit expansion of the New York bankers, a policy which culminated in the Great Depression of 1929-31 and helped paralyze the economic structure of the world. Paul Warburg had resigned in May, 1918, after the moneta ry system of the United States had been changed from a bond-secured currenc y to a currency based upon commercial paper and the shares of the Federal Reserve Banks. Warburg returned to his five hundred thousand dolla r a year job with Kuhn, Loeb Company, but he continued to determine the pol icy of the Federal Reserve System, as President of the Federal Advisor y Council and as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Acceptance Council. From 1921 to 1929, Paul Warburg organized three of the greatest trusts in the United States, the International Acceptance Ban k, largest acceptance bank in the world, Agfa Ansco Film Corporation, wit h headquarters in Belgium, and I.G. Farben Corporation whose American branch Warburg set up as I.G. Chemical Corporation. The Westinghouse Corporation is also one of his creations. In the early 1920s, the Federal Reserve System play ed the decisive role in the re-entry of Russia into the international finance s tructure. Winthrop and Stimson continued to be the correspondents between Russian and American"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 132 bankers, and Henry L. Stimson handled the negotiati ons concluding in our recognition of the Soviet after Roosevelt’s electio n in 1932. This was an anti- climax, because we had long before resumed exchange relations with Russian financiers. The Federal Reserve System began purchasing Russian gold in 1920, and Russian currency was accepted on the Exchanges. Acc ording to Colonel Ely Garrison, in his autobiography, and according to th e United States Naval Secret Service Report on Paul Warburg, the Russian Revolution had been financed by the Rothschilds and Warburgs, with a me mber of the Warburg family carrying the actual funds used by Lenin and Trotsky in Stockholm in 1918. An article in the English monthly \"Fortnightly\", Ju ly, 1922, says: \"During the past year, practically every single cap italistic institution has been restored. This is true of the State Bank, private banking, the Stock Exchange, the right to possess money to unlimited amount, the right of inheritance, the bil l of exchange system, and other institutions and practices involved in the conduct of private indust ry and trade. A great part of the former nationalized industries are now found in semi-indep endent trusts.\" The organization of powerful trusts in Russia under the guise of Communism made possible the receipt of large amounts of finan cial and technical help from the United States. The Russian aristocracy had been wiped out because it was too inefficient to manage a modern industria l state. The international financiers provided funds for Lenin and Trotsky to overthrow the Czarist regime and keep Russia in the First World War. Pete r Drucker, spokesman for the oligarchy in America, declared in an articl e in the Saturday Evening Post in 1948, that: \"RUSSIA IS THE IDEAL OF THE MANAGED ECONOMY TOWARDS WHICH WE ARE MOVING.\" In Russia, the issuance of sufficient currency to h andle the needs of their economy occurred only after a government had been p ut in power which had absolute control of the people. During the 1920s, R ussia issued large quantities of so-called \"inflation money\", a manage d currency. The same \"Fortnightly\" article (of July, 1922) observed that :"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 133 \"As economic pressure produced the ‘astronomical di mensions system’ of currency; it can never destroy it. Taken alone, the system is self-contain ed, logically perfected, even intelligent. And it can perish only through the collapse or destruction of the political edifice which it decorates.\" \"Fortnightly\" also remarked, in 1929, that: \"Since 1921, the daily life of the Soviet citizen i s no different from that of the American citizen, and the Soviet system of government is more economi cal.\" Admiral Kolchak, leader of the White Russian armies , was supported by the international bankers, who sent British and America n troops to Siberia in order to have a pretext for printing Kolchak rubles . At one time in 1920, the bankers were manipulating on the London Exchange th e old Czarist rubles, Kerensky rubles and Kolchak rubles, the values of a ll three fluctuating according to the movements of the Allied troops aid ing Kolchak. Kolchak also was in possession of considerable amounts of g old which had been seized by his armies. After his defeat, a trainload of thi s gold disappeared in Siberia. At the Senate Hearings in 1921 on the Fede ral Reserve System, it was brought out that the System had been receiving this gold. Congressman Dunbar questioned Governor W.P.G. Harding of the Fe deral Reserve Board as follows: DUNBAR: \"In other words, Russia is sending a great deal of gold to the European countries, which in turn send it to us?\" HARDING: \"This is done to pay for the stuff bought in this country and to create dollar exchange.\" DUNBAR: \"At the same time, that gold came from Russ ia through Europe?\" HARDING: \"Some of it is thought to be Kolchak gold, coming through Siberia, but it is none of the Federal Reserve Bank s’ business. The Secretary of the Treasury has issued instructions to the assa y office not to take any gold which does not bear the mint mark of a friendly nat ion.\" Just what Governor Harding meant by \"a friendly nat ion\" is not clear. In 1921, we were not at war with any country, but Cong ress was already beginning to question the international gold dealin gs of the Federal Reserve System. Governor Harding could very well shrug his shoulders and say that it was none of the Federal Reserve Banks’ business where the gold came from. Gold knows no nationality or race. The United States by law had ceased to be interested in where its gold came from in 1906, when Secretary"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 134 of the Treasury Shaw made arrangements with several of the larger New York banks (ones in which he had interests) to purchase gold with advances of cash from the United States Treasury, which would t hen purchase the gold from these banks. The Treasury could claim that it did not know where its gold came from since their office only registers th e bank from which it made the purchase. Since 1906, the Treasury has not know n from which of the international gold merchants it was buying its gold . The international gold dealings of the Federal Rese rve System, and its active support in helping the League of Nations to force a ll the nations of Europe and South America back on the gold standa rd for the benefit of international gold merchants like Eugene Meyer, Jr. and Albert Strauss, is best demonstrated by a classic incident, the sterli ng credit of 1925. J.E. Darling wrote, in the English periodical, \"Spe ctator\", on January 10, 1925 that: \"Obviously, it is of the first importance to the Un ited States to induce England to resume the gold standard as early as possible. An American controll ed Gold Standard, which must inevitably result in the United States becoming the world’s su preme financial power, makes England a tributary and satellite, and New York the world’s f inancial centre.\" Mr. Darling fails to point out that the American pe ople have as little to do with this as the British people, and that resumptio n of the gold standard by Britain would benefit only that small group of inte rnational gold merchants who own the world’s gold. No wonder that \"Banker’s Magazine\" gleefully remarked in July, 1925 that: \"The outstanding event of the past half year in the banking world was the restoration of the gold standard.\" The First World War changed the status of the Unite d States from that of a debtor nation to the position of the world’s greate st creditor nation, a title formerly occupied by England. Since debt is money, according to the Governor Marriner Eccles of the Federal Reserve Boa rd, this also made us the richest nation of the world. The war also cause d the removal of the headquarters of the world’s acceptance market from London to New York, and Paul Warburg became the most powerful trade acc eptance banker in the world. The mainstay of the international financiers , however, remained the same. The gold standard was still the basis of fore ign exchange, and the small"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 135 group of internationals who owned the gold controll ed the monetary system of the Western nations. Professor Gustav Cassel wrote in 1928: \"The American dollar, not the gold standard, is the world’s monetary standard. The American Federal Reserve Board has the power to determine th e purchasing power of the dollar by making changes in the rate of discount, and thus controls the monetary standard of the world.\" If this were true, the members of the Federal Reser ve Board would be the most powerful financiers in the world. Occasionally their membership includes such influential men as Paul Warburg or Eu gene Meyer, Jr., but usually they are a rubber-stamp committee for the F ederal Advisory Council and the London bankers. In May, 1925, the British Parliament passed the Gol d Standard Act, putting Great Britain back on the gold standard. The Federa l Reserve System’s major role in this event came out on March 16, 1926 , when George Seay, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, t estified before the House Banking and Currency Committee that: \"A verbal understanding confirmed by correspondence , extended Great Britain a two hundred million dollar gold loan or credit. All negotiation s were conducted between Benjamin Strong, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York an d Mr. Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England. The purpose of this loan was to he lp England get back on the gold standard, and the loan was to be met by investment of Federal Reserve funds in bills of exchange and foreign securities.\" The Federal Reserve Bulletin of June, 1925, stated that: \"Under its arrangement with the Bank of England the Federal Reserve Bank of New York undertakes to sell gold on credit to the Bank of En gland from time to time during the next two"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 136 years, but not to exceed $200,000,000 outstanding a t any one time.\" A two hundred million dollar gold credit had been a rranged by a verbal understanding between the international bankers, Be njamin Strong and Montagu Norman. It was apparent by this time that t he Federal Reserve System had other interests at heart than the financ ial needs of American business and industry. Great Britain’s return to th e gold standard was further facilitated by an additional gold loan of a hundred million dollars from J.P. Morgan Company. Winston Churchill, Britis h Chancellor of the Exchequer, complained later that the cost to the Br itish government of this loan was $1,125,000 the first year, this sum repres enting the profit to J.P. Morgan Company in that time. The matter of changing the discount rate, for insta nce, has never been satisfactorily explained. Inquiry at the Federal Re serve Board in Washington elicited the reply that \"the condition of the money market is the prime consideration behind changes in the rate.\" Since th e money market is in New York, it takes no imagination to deduce that New Yo rk bankers may be interested in changes of the rate and often attempt to influence it. Norman Lombard, in the periodical \"World’s Work\" wr ites that: \"In their consideration and disposal of proposed ch anges of policy, the Federal Reserve Board should follow the procedure and ethics observed by our court of law. Suggestions that there should be a change of rate or that the Reserve Bank s should buy or sell securities may come from anyone and with no formality or written argument. T he suggestion may be made to a Governor or Director of the Federal Reserve System over the tel ephone or at his club over the luncheon table, or it may be made in the course of a casual call on a member of the Federal Reserve Board. The interests of the one proposing the change need not be revealed, and his name and any suggestions he makes are usually kept secret. If it concerns th e matter of open market operations, the public has no inkling of the decision until the regular we ekly statement appears, showing changes in the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 137 holdings of the Federal Reserve Banks. Meanwhile, t here is no public discussion, there is no statement of the reasons for the decision, or of th e names of those opposing or favoring it.\" The chances of the average citizen meeting a Govern or of the Federal Reserve System at his club are also slight. The House Hearings on Stabilization of the Purchasi ng Power of the Dollar in 1928 proved conclusively that the Federal Reserv e Board worked in close cooperation with the heads of European central bank s, and that the Depression of 1929-31 was planned at a secret lunch eon of the Federal Reserve Board and those heads of European central b anks in 1927. The Board has never been made responsible to the public for its decisions or actions. The constitutional checks and balances see m not to operate in finance. The true allegiance of the members of the Federal R eserve Board has always been to the central bankers. The three features of the central bank, its ownership by private stockholders who receive rent and profit for their use of the nation’s credit, absolute control of the nat ion’s financial resources, and mobilization of the nation’s credit to finance fore igners, all were demonstrated by the Federal Reserve System during t he first fifteen years of its operations. Further demonstration of the international purposes of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is provided by the \"Edge Amendment\" of December 24, 1919, which authorizes the organization of corporations e xpressly for \"engaging in international foreign banking and other internation al or foreign financial operations, including the dealing in gold or bullio n, and the holding of stock in foreign corporations.\" In commenting on this ame ndment, E.W. Kemmerer, economist from Princeton University, rema rked that: \"The federal reserve system is proving to be a grea t influence in the internationalizing of American trade and American finance.\" The fact that this internationalizing of American t rade and American finance has been a direct cause for involving us in two wor ld wars does not disturb Mr. Kemmerer. There is plenty of evidence to show h ow Paul Warburg used the Federal Reserve System as the instrument for ge tting trade acceptance adopted on a wide scale by American businessmen. The use of trade acceptances, (which are the curren cy of international trade) by bankers and corporations in the United States pr ior to 1915 was practically unknown. The rise of the Federal Reserv e System exactly"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 138 parallels the increase in the use of acceptances in this country, nor is this a coincidence. The men who wanted the Federal Reserve System were the men who set up acceptance banks and profited by the use of acceptances. As early as 1910, the National Monetary Commission began to issue pamphlets and other propaganda urging bankers and b usinessmen in this country to adopt trade acceptances in their transac tions. For three years the Commission carried on this campaign, and the Aldrich Plan included a broad provision authorizing the introduc tion and use of bankers’ acceptances into the American system of commercial paper. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 as passed by Congre ss did not specifically authorize the use of acceptances, but the Federal R eserve Board in 1915 and 1916 defined \"trade acceptance\", further defined by Regulation A Series of 1920, and further defined by Series 1924. One of th e first official acts of the Board of Governors in 1914 was to grant acceptances a preferentially low rate of discount at Federal Reserve Banks. Since ac ceptances were not being used in this country at that time, no explanation o f business exigency could be advanced for this action. It was apparent that s omeone in power on the Board of Governors wanted the adoptance of acceptan ces. The National Bank Act of 1864, which was the determ ining financial authority of the United States until November, 1914 , did not permit banks to lend their credit. Consequently, the power of banks to create money was greatly limited. We did not have a bank of issue, t hat is, a central bank, which could create money. To get a central bank, th e bankers caused money panic after money panic on the business people of t he United States, by shipping gold out of the country, creating a money shortage, and then importing it back. After we got our central bank, t he Federal Reserve System, there was no longer any need for a money pa nic, because the banks could create money. However, the panic as an instru ment of power over the business and financial community was used again on two important occasions, in 1920, causing the Agricultural Depres sion, because state banks and trust companies had refused to join the Federal Reserve System, and in 1929, causing the Great Depression, which centraliz ed nearly all power in this country in the hands of a few great trusts. A trade acceptance is a draft drawn by the seller o f goods on the purchaser, and accepted by the purchaser, with a time of expir ation stamped upon it. The use of trade acceptances in the wholesale marke t supplies short-term, assured credit to carry goods in process of product ion, storage, transit, and marketing. It facilitates domestic and foreign comm erce. Seemingly, then, the bankers who wished to replace the open-book account system with the trade acceptance system were progressive men who wished t o help American import-export trade. Much propaganda was issued to that effect, but this was not really the story."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 139 The open-book system, heretofore used entirely by A merican business people, allowed a discount for cash. The acceptance system discourages the use of cash, by allowing a discount for credit. The open-b ook system also allowed much easier terms of payment, with liberal extensio ns on the debt. The acceptance does not allow this, since it is a short-term credit with the time-date stamped upon it. It is out of the seller’s hands, and in the hands of a bank, usually an accep tance bank, which does not allow any extension of time. Thus, the adoption of acceptances by American businessmen during the 1920’s greatly faci litated the domination and swallowing up of small business into huge trust s, which accelerated the crash of 1929. Trade acceptances had been used to some extent in t he United States before the Civil War. During that war, exigencies of trade had destroyed the acceptance as a credit medium, and it had not come back into favor in this country, our people preferring the simplicity and g enerosity of the open-book system. Open-book accounts are a single-name commer cial paper, bearing only the name of the debtor. Acceptances are two-na me paper, bearing the name of the debtor and the creditor. Thus they beca me commodities to be bought and sold by banks. To the creditor, under th e open-book system, the debt is a liability. To the acceptance bank holding an acceptance, the debt is an asset. The men who set up acceptance banks in th is country, under the leadership of Paul Warburg, secured control of the billions of dollars of credit existing as open accounts on the books of Am erican businessmen. Governor Marriner Eccles of the Federal Reserve Boa rd stated before the House Banking and Currency Committee that: \"Debt is the basis for the creation of money.\" Large holders of trade acceptances got the use of b illions of dollars worth of credit-money, besides the rate of interest charged upon the acceptance itself. It is obvious why Paul Warburg should have devoted so much time, money, and energy to getting acceptances adopted by this c ountry’s banking machinery. On September 4, 1914, the National City Bank accept ed the first time-draft drawn on a national bank under provisions of the Fe deral Reserve Act of 1913. This was the beginning of the end of the open -book account system as an important factor in wholesale trade. Beverly Har ris, vice-president of the National City Bank of New York, issued a pamphlet i n 1915 stating that: \"Merchants using the open account system are usurpi ng the functions of bankers.\" In The New York Times on June 14, 1920, Paul Warbur g, Chairman of the American Acceptance Council, said:"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 140 \"Unless the Federal Reserve Board puts itself heart and soul behind the untrammeled development of acceptances as a prime investment fo r banks of the Federal Reserve Banks the future safe and sound development of the system wil l be jeopardized.\" This was a statement of the purpose of Warburg and his bunch who wanted \"monetary reform\" in this country. They were out to get control of all credit in the United States, and they got it , by means of the Federal Reserve System, the acceptance system, and the lack of concern by the citizens. The First World War was a boon to the introduction of trade acceptances, and the volume jumped to four hundred million dolla rs in 1917, growing through the 1920s to more than a billion dollars a year, which culminated in a high peak just before the Great Depression of 192 9-31. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s charts show that its use of acceptances reached a peak in November, 1929, the month of the stock ma rket crash, and declined sharply thereafter. The acceptance people by then h ad gotten what they wanted, which was control of American business and industry. \"Fortune Magazine\" in February of 1950 pointed out that: \"Volume of acceptances declined from $1,732 million in 1929 to $209 million in 1940, because of the concentration of acceptance banking in a few hands, and the Treasury’s low-interest policy, which made direct loans cheaper than accept ance. There has been a slight upturn since the war, but it is often cheaper for large companie s to finance imports from their own coffers.\" In other words, the \"large companies\" more accurate ly, the great trusts, now have control of credit and have not needed acceptan ces. Besides the barrage of propaganda issued by the Federal Reserve System itself, the National Association of Credit Men, the American Bankers’ As sociation, and other fraternal organizations of the New York bankers dev oted much time and money to distributing acceptance propaganda. Even t heir flood of lectures and pamphlets proved insufficient, and in 1919 Paul Warburg organized the American Acceptance Council, which was devoted enti rely to acceptance propaganda. The first convention held by this association at De troit, Michigan, on June 9, 1919, coincided with the annual convention of the N ational Association of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 141 Credit Men, held there on that date, so that \"inter ested observers might with facility participate in the lectures and meetings o f both groups,\" according to a pamphlet issued by the American Acceptance Counci l. Paul Warburg was elected President of this organiza tion, and later became chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Acceptance Council, a position which he held until his death in 1932. T he Council published lists of corporations using trade acceptances, all of the m businesses in which Kuhn, Loeb Co. or its affiliates held control. Lect ures given before the Council or by members of the Council were attractiv ely bound and distributed free by the National City Bank of New Y ork to the country’s businessmen. Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking an d Currency Committee, charged in 1922 that the American Accept ance Council was exercising undue influence on the Federal Reserve B oard and called for a Congressional investigation, but Congress was not i nterested. At the second annual convention of the American Acc eptance Council, held in New York on December 2, 1920, President Paul War burg stated: \"It is a great satisfaction to report that during t he year under review it was possible for the American Acceptance Council to further develop and strengthen its relations with the Federal Reserve Board.\" During the 1920s Paul Warburg, who had resigned fro m the Federal Reserve Board after holding a position as Governor for a ye ar in wartime, continued to exercise direct personal influence on the Federa l Reserve Board by meeting with the Board as President of the Federal Advisory Council and as President of the American Acceptance Council. He wa s, from its organization in 1920 until his death in 1932, Chairman of the Bo ard of the International Acceptance Bank of New York, the largest acceptance bank in the world. His brother, Felix M. Warburg, also a partner in Kuhn, Loeb Co., was director of the International Acceptance Bank and Paul’s son , James Paul Warburg, was Vice-President. Paul Warburg was also a directo r on other important acceptance banks in this country, such as Westingho use Acceptance Bank, which were organized in the United States immediate ly after the World War, when the headquarters of the international acceptan ce market was moved from London to New York, and Paul Warburg became th e most powerful acceptance banker in the world.

Those in the know snickered when \"Annie\", t he musical comedy version of this story, had a highly successful run of several years on Broadway, because the vast majority of the audience had no idea that this was merely another Warburg operation. It was the transference of the acceptance market fr om England to this country which gave rise to Thomas Lamont’s ecstatic speech before the Academy of Political Science in 1917 that: \"The dollar, not the pound, is now the basis for in ternational exchange.\" Americans were proud to hear that, but they did not realize at what a price. Visible proof of the undue influence of the America n Acceptance Council on the Federal Reserve Board, about which Congressman McFadden complained, is the chart showing the rate-pattern o f the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the 1920s. The Bank’s official discount rate follows exactly for nine years the ni nety-day bankers’ acceptance rate, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Ne w York sets the discount rate for the rest of the Reserve Banks. Throughout the 1920s the Board of Governors retaine d two of its first members, C.S. Hamlin and Adolph C. Miller. These me n found themselves careers as arbiters of the nation’s monetary policy . Hamlin was on the Board from 1914 until 1936, when he was appointed Special Counsel to the Board, while Miller served from 1914 until 1931. These two men were allowed to stay on the Board so many years because they were b oth eminently respectable men who gave the Board a certain presti ge in the eyes of the public. During these years one important banker aft er another came on the Board, served for awhile, and went on to better thi ngs. Neither Miller nor Hamlin ever objected to anything that the New York bankers wanted. They changed the discount rate and they performed open m arket operation with Government securities whenever Wall Street wanted t hem to. Behind them was the figure of Paul Warburg, who exercised a con tinuous and dominant influence as President of the Federal Advisory Coun cil, on which he had such men of common interests with himself as Winthrop Al drich and J.P. Morgan. Warburg was never too occupied with his duties of o rganizing the big international trusts to supervise the nation’s fina ncial structures. His influence from 1902, when he arrived in this countr y as immigrant from Germany, until 1932, the year of his death, was dep endent on his European alliance with the banking cartel.

BEEDY: \"I notice on your chart that the lines w hich produce the most violent fluctuations are found under ‘Money Rates i n New York.’ As the rates of money rise and fall in the big cities the loans that are made on investments seem to take advantage of them, at pres ent, a quite violent change, while industry in general does not seem to avail itself of these violent changes, and that line is fairly even, there being no great rises or declines. GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: This was all more or less i n the interests of the international situation. They sold gold cred its in New York for sterling balances in London. REPRESENTATIVE STRONG: (No relation to Benjamin): H as the Federal Reserve Board the power to attract gold to this cou ntry? E.A. GOLDENWEISER, research director for the Board: The Federal Reserve Board could attract gold to this country by making money rates higher. GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: I think we are very close t o the point where any further solicitude on our part for the mo netary concerns of Europe can be altered. The Federal Reserve Board la st summer, 1927, set out by a policy of open market purchases, followed in c ourse by reduction on the discount rate at the Reserve Banks, to ease the cre dit situation and to cheapen the cost of money. The official reasons for that departure in credit policy were that it would help to stabilize interna tional exchange and stimulate the exportation of gold. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Will you tell us briefly how tha t matter was brought to the Federal Reserve Board and what were the influences that went into the final determination? GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: You are asking a question i mpossible for me to answer."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 147 CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Perhaps I can clarify it--where did the suggestion come from that caused this decision of the change o f rates last summer? GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: The three largest central b anks in Europe had sent representatives to this country. Th ere were the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Hjalmar Schacht, and Profe ssor Rist, Deputy Governor of the Bank of France. These gentlemen wer e in conference with officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. After a week or two, they appeared in Washington for the better part of a day . They came down the evening of one day and were the guests of the Gover nors of the Federal Reserve Board the following day, and left that afte rnoon for New York. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Were the members of the Board pr esent at this luncheon? GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: Oh, yes, it was given by th e Governors of the Board for the purpose of bringing all of us tog ether. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Was it a social affair, or were matters of importance discussed? GOVERNOR MILLER: I would say it was mainly a social affair. Personally, I had a long conversation with Dr. Schacht alone be fore the luncheon, and also one of considerable length with Professor Rist . After the luncheon I began a conversation with Mr. Norman, which was joi ned in by Governor Strong of New York. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Was that a formal meeting of the Board? GOVERNOR ADOLPH MILLER: No. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: It was just an informal discussi on of the matters they had been discussing in New York? GOVERNOR MILLER: I assume so. It was mainly a socia l occasion. What I said was mainly in the nature of generalities. The heads of these central banks also spoke in generalities. MR. KING: What did they want? GOVERNOR MILLER: They were very candid in answers t o questions. I wanted to have a talk with Mr. Norman, and we both stayed behind after luncheon, and were joined by the other foreign repr esentatives and the officials of the New York Reserve Bank. These gentl emen were all pretty concerned with the way the gold standard was workin g. They were therefore desirous of seeing an easy money market in New York and lower rates, which would deter gold from moving from Europe to this co untry. That would be very much in the interest of the international mone y situation which then existed."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 148 MR. BEEDY: Was there some understanding arrived at between the representatives of these foreign banks and the Fede ral Reserve Board or the New York Federal Reserve Bank? GOVERNOR MILLER: Yes. MR.

GOVERNOR MILLER: No. Later, there came a meeting of the Open- Market Policy Committee, the investment policy comm ittee of the Federal Reserve System, by which and to which certain recom mendations were made. My recollection is that about eighty million dollars worth of securities were purchased in August consistent with this plan. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: Was there any conference between the members of the Open Market Committee and those bankers from abroad? GOVERNOR MILLER: They may have met them as individu als, but not as a committee. MR. KING: How does the Open-Market Committee get it s ideas? GOVERNOR MILLER: They sit around and talk about it. I do not know whose idea this was. It was distinctly a time in wh ich there was a cooperative spirit at work. CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: You have outlined here negotiati ons of very great importance.

It seems to me that a matter of that importance should have been made a matter of record in Washington. GOVERNOR MILLER: I agree with you.

CHAIRMAN MCFADDEN: I would like to put in the recor d all who attended that luncheon in Washington. GOVERNOR MILLER: In addition to the names I have gi ven you, there was also present one of the younger men from the Bank o f France. I think all members of the Federal Reserve Board were there.

The prominent bankers from Germany, France, and England came here at whose suggestion? GOVERNOR MILLER: A situation had been created that was distinctly embarrassing to London by reason of the impending w ithdrawal of a certain amount of gold which had been recovered by France a nd that had originally been shipped and deposited in the Bank of England b y the French Government as a war credit. There was getting to be some tension of mind in Europe because France was beginning to put her hous e in order for a return to the gold standard. This situation was one which called for some moderating influence. MR. KING: Who was the moving spirit who got those p eople together? GOVERNOR MILLER: That is a detail with which I am n ot familiar. REPRESENTATIVE STRONG: Would it not be fair to say that the fellows who wanted the gold were the ones who instigated th e meeting? GOVERNOR MILLER: They came over here.

Who cal led the conference? GOVERNOR MILLER: My recollection is that it was cal led by the Bank of France. GOVERNOR YOUNG: No, it was the League of Nations wh o called them together.\" The secret meeting between the Governors of the Fed eral Reserve Board and the heads of the European central banks was not cal led to stabilize anything. It was held to discuss the best way of getting the gold held in the United States by the System back to Europe to force the na tions of that continent back on the gold standard. The League of Nations ha d not yet succeeded in doing that, the objective for which that body was s et up in the first place, because the Senate of the United States had refused to let Woodrow Wilson betray us to an i nternational monetary authority. It took the Second World War and Frankli n D. Roosevelt to do that. Meanwhile, Europe had to have our gold and th e Federal Reserve System gave it to them, five hundred million dollar s worth. The movement of that gold out of the United States caused the defla tion of the stock boom, the end of the business prosperity of the 1920s and the Great Depression of 1929- 31, the worst calamity which has ever befallen this nation. It is entirely logical to say that the American people suffered th at depression as a punishment for not joining the League of Nations. T he bankers knew what would happen when that five hundred million dollars worth of gold was sent to Europe. They wanted the Depression because it pu t the business and finance of the United States in their hands. The Hearings continue: MR. BEEDY: \"Mr. Ebersole of the Treasury Department concluded his remarks at the dinner we attended last night by say ing that the Federal Reserve System did not want stabilization and the A merican businessman did not want it. They want these fluctuations in pr ices, not only in securities but in commodities, in trade generally, because tho se who are now in control are making their profits out of that very instabili ty.

Hamlin of the Federal Reserve Board on M ay 23rd, 1928: \"All I know is that Governor Strong has been very i ll, and he has gone over to Europe primarily, I understand, as a matter of health. Of course, he knows well the various offices of the European central banks and undoubtedly will call on them.\" Governor Benjamin Strong died a few weeks after his return from Europe, without appearing before the Committee. The purpose of these hearings before the House Comm ittee on Banking and Currency in 1928 was to investigate the necessity f or passing the Strong bill, presented by Representative Strong (no relation to Benjamin, the international banker), which would have provided th at the Federal Reserve System be empowered to act to stabilize the purchas ing power of the dollar. This had been one of the promises made by Carter Gl ass and Woodrow Wilson when they presented the Federal Reserve Act before Congress in 1912, and such a provision had actually been put in the Act by Senator Robert L. Owen, but Carter Glass’ House Committee o n Banking and Currency had struck it out. The traders and specula tors did not want the dollar to become stable, because they would no long er be able to make a profit. The citizens of this country had been led t o gamble on the stock market in the 1920s because the traders had created a nationwide condition of instability. The Strong Bill of 1928 was defeated in Congress. The financial situation in the United States during the 1920s was characterized by an inflation of speculative values only. It was a trader-made situation. Prices of commodities remained low, desp ite the over-pricing of securities on the exchange. The purchasers did not expect their securities to p ay dividends. The idea was to hold them awhile and sell them at a profit. It h ad to stop somewhere, as Paul Warburg remarked in March, 1929. Wall Street d id not let it stop until the people had put their savings into these over-pr iced securities. We had the spectacle of the President of the United States, Ca lvin Coolidge, acting as a shill for the stock market operators when he recomm ended to the American people that they continue buying on the market, in 1927. There had been uneasiness about th e inflated condition of the market, and the bankers showed their power by g etting the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, a nd the Chairman of the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 153 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue statements that brokers’ loans were not too high, and that the cond ition of the stock market was sound. Irving Fisher warned us in 1927 that the burden of stabilizing prices all over the world would soon fall on the United States. One of the results of the Second World War was the establishment of an Intern ational Monetary Fund to do just that. Professor Gustav Cassel remar ked in the same year that: \"The downward movement of prices has not been a spo ntaneous result of forces beyond our control. It is the result of a policy deliberately framed to bring down prices and give a higher value to the monetary unit.\" The Democratic Party, after passing the Federal Res erve Act and leading us into the First World War, assumed the role of an op position party during the 1920s. They were on the outside of the political fe nce, and were supported during those lean years by liberal handouts from Be rnard Baruch, according to his biography. How far outside of it they were a nd how little chance they had in 1928, is shown by a plank in the official De mocratic Party platform adopted at Houston on June 28, 1928: \"The administration of the Federal Reserve System f or the advantage of the stock-market speculators should cease. It must be administered f or the benefit of farmers, wage-earners, merchants, manufacturers, and others engaged in con structive business.\" This idealism insured defeat for its protagonist, A l Smith, who was nominated by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The campaign ag ainst Al Smith also was marked by appeals to religious intolerance, bec ause he was a Catholic. The bankers stirred up anti-Catholic sentiment all over the country to achieve the election of their World War I protégé, Herbert Hoover. Instead of being used to promote the financial stab ility of the country, as had been promised by Woodrow Wilson when the Act was pa ssed, financial instability has been steadily promoted by the Feder al Reserve Board.

We have seen our agriculture pass through a long period of suffe ring and even of revolution, during which one million farmers left their farms, due to difficulti es with the price of land and the odd status of credit conditions. We have suffered the most extens ive era of bank failures ever known in this country. Forty-five hundred banks have closed their doors since the Reserve System began functioning. In some Western towns there have been times when all banks in that community failed, and given banks have failed over and over a gain.

The Reserve Board reached the low ebb of the Wilson period with the appointment of a member who was chosen for his ability to get delegates for a Democratic candidate for the Presid ency. However, this level was not the dregs reached under President Harding. He appointed an ol d crony, D.R.

When reserve directors were to be chosen, the country bankers often refused to vote, or, when they voted, cast their ballots as di rected by city correspondents.

If such men existed, they did not get on the Federal Reserve Board. In one reserve bank today the chief management is in the hands of a man who never did a day’s actual banking in his life, while in another reserve institution both Gov ernor and Chairman are the former heads of now defunct banks. They naturally have a high failure record in their distr ict. In a majority of districts the standard of performance a s judged by good banking standards is disgracefully low among r eserve executive officials. The policy of the Federal Rese rve Bank of Philadelphia is known in the System as the ‘Friends and Relatives Banks.’ \"It was while making war profits in considerable am ounts that someone conceived the idea of using the profits to provide themselves with phenom enally costly buildings.

Three years prior to that, the present bull market was just getting under way. In the autumn of 1926 a group of bankers, among them one of world famous name, were sitting at a ta ble in a Washington hotel. One of them raised the question whether the low discount rates of the System were not likely to encourage speculation. \"‘Yes’, replied the famous banker, ‘they will, but that cannot be helped.

Hawtrey, the English economist, said, in the M arch, 1926 American Economic Review: \"When external investment outstrips the supply of g eneral savings the investment market must carry the excess with money borrowed from the banks . A remedy is control of credit by a rise in bank rate.\" The Federal Reserve Board applied this control of c redit, but not in 1926, nor as a remedial measure. It was not applied until 1929, and then the rate was raised as a punitive measure, to freeze out eve rybody but the big trusts. Professor Cassel, in the Quarterly Journal of Econo mics, August 1928, wrote that: \"The fact that a central bank fails to raise its ba nk rate in accordance with the actual situation of the capital market very much increases the strength of the cyclical movement of trade, with all its pernicious effects on social economy. A rational re gulation of the bank rate lies in our hands, and may be accomplished only if we perceive its importa nce and decide to go in for such a policy. With a bank rate regulated on these lines the condi tions for the development of trade cycles would be radically altered, and indeed, our familia r trade cycles would be a thing of the past.\" This is the most authoritative premise yet made rel ating that our business depressions are artificially precipitated. The occu rrence of the Panic of 1907, the Agricultural Depression of 1920, and the Great Depression of 1929, all three in good crop years and in periods of national prosperity, suggests that premise is not guesswork.

The League of Nations had achieved its goal of gett ing the nations of Europe back on the gold standard by 1928, but three-fourth s of the world’s gold was in France and the United States. The problem was ho w to get that gold to countries which needed it as a basis for money and credit. The answer was action by the Federal Reserve System. Following the secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board and the heads of the foreign central banks in 1927, the Federal Rese rve Banks in a few months doubled their holdings of Government securities and acceptances, which resulted in the exportation of five hundred million dollars in gold in that year. The System’s market activities forced the rat es of call money down on the Stock Exchange, and forced gold out of the coun try. Foreigners also took this opportunity to purchase heavily in Government securities because of the low call money rate. \"The agreement between the Bank of England and the Washington Federal Reserve authorities many months ago was that we would force the export of 725 million of gold by reducing the bank rates here, thus helping the stabilization of Franc e and Europe and putting France on a gold basis.\"89 (April 20, 1928) On February 6, 1929, Mr. Montagu Norman, Governor o f the Bank of England, came to Washington and had a conference wi th Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury. Immediately after that m ysterious visit, the Federal Reserve Board abruptly changed its policy a nd pursued a high discount rate policy, abandoning the cheap money po licy which it had inaugurated in 1927 after Mr. Norman’s other visit. The stock market crash and the deflation of the American people’s financia l structure was scheduled to take place in March. To get the ball rolling, Pa ul Warburg gave the official warning to the traders to get out of the market. In his annual report to the stockholders of his International Acceptance Bank, in March, 1929, Mr. Warburg said: \"If the orgies of unrestrained speculation are perm itted to spread, the ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves, but to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.\""},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 162 During three years of \"unrestrained speculation\", M r. Warburg had not seen fit to make any remarks about the condition of the Stoc k Exchange.

Mr. Warburg’s concern w as genuine, for the stock market bubble had gone much farther than it h ad been intended to go, and the bankers feared the consequences if the peop le realized what was going on. When this report in The New York Times st arted a sudden wave of selling on the Exchange, the bankers grew panicky, and it was decided to ease the market somewhat. Accordingly, Warburg’s Na tional City Bank rushed twenty-five million dollars in cash to the c all money market, and postponed the day of the crash. The revelation of the Federal Reserve Board’s final decision to trigger the Crash of 1929 appears, amazingly enough, in The New York Times. On April 20, 1929, the Times headlined, \"Federal Advisory Co uncil Mystery __________________________ 89 Clarence W. Barron, They Told Barron, Harpers, N ew York, 1930, p. 353 Meeting in Washington. Resolutions were adopted by the council and transmitted to the board, but their purpose was clo sely guarded. An atmosphere of deep mystery was thrown about the pro ceedings both by the board and the council. Every effort was made to gua rd the proceedings of this extraordinary session. Evasive replies were gi ven to newspaper correspondents.\" Only the innermost council of \"The London Connectio n\" knew that it had been decided at this \"mystery meeting\" to bring dow n the curtain on the greatest speculative boom in American history. Thos e in the know began to sell off all speculative stocks and put their money in government bonds. Those who were not privy to this secret information , and they included some of the wealthiest men in America, continued to hold their speculative stocks and lost everything they had. In FDR, My Exploited Father-in-Law, Col. Curtis B. Dall, who was a broker on Wall Street at that time, writes of the Crash, \" Actually it was the calculated ‘shearing’ of the public by the World Mo ney-Powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of the supply of call m oney in the New York money market.\"90 Overnight, the Federal Reserve Sys tem had raised the call rate to twenty percent. Unable to meet this rate, t he speculators’ only alternative was to jump out of windows. The New York Federal Reserve Bank rate, which dicta ted the national interest rate, went to six percent on November 1, 1 929. After the investors had been bankrupted, it dropped to one and one-half percent on May 8, 1931. Congressman Wright Patman in \"A Primer On Mon ey\", says that the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 163 money supply decreased by eight billion dollars fro m 1929 to 1933, causing 11,630 banks of the total of 26,401 in the United S tates to go bankrupt and close their doors. The Federal Reserve Board had already warned the st ockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks to get out of the Market, on February 6, 1929, but it had not bothered to say anything to the rest of the people. Nobody knew what was going on except the Wall Street bankers wh o were running the show. Gold movements were completely unreliable. Th e Quarterly Journal of Economics noted that: \"The question has been raised, not only in this cou ntry, but in several European countries, as to whether customs statistics record with accuracy the movements of precious metals, and, when investigation has been m ade, confidence in such figures has been weakened rather than strengthened. Any movement between France and England, for instance, should be recorde d in each country, but such comparison shows an average yearly discrepancy of f ifty million francs for France and eighty-five million francs for England. These e normous discrepancies are not accounted for.\" The Right Honorable Reginald McKenna stated that: __________________________ 90 Col. Curtis B. Dall, F.D.R., My Exploited Father -in-Law, Liberty Lobby, Wash., D.C. 1970 \"Study of the relations between changes in gold sto ck and movement in price levels shows what should be very obvious, but is by no means recogniz ed, that the gold standard is in no sense automatic in operation. The gold standard can be, a nd is, usefully managed and controlled for the benefit of a small group of international traders.\""},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 164 In August 1929, the Federal Reserve Board raised th e rate to six percent. The Bank of England in the next month raised its rate f rom five and one-half percent to six and one-half percent. Dr. Friday in the September, 1929, issue of Review of Reviews, could find no reason for the Board’s action: \"The Federal Reserve statement for August 7, 1929, shows that signs of inadequacy for autumn requirements do not exist. Gold resources are consi derably more than the previous year, and gold continues to move in, to the financial embarrassmen t of Germany and England. The reasons for the Board’s action must be sought elsewhere. The pu blic has been given only the hint that ‘This problem has presented difficulties because of certa in peculiar conditions’. Every reason which Governor Young advanced for lowering the bank rate last year exists now. Increasing the rate means that not only is there danger of drawing gold from abroad, but imports of the yellow metal have been in progress for the last four months. To do anything to accentuate this is to take the responsibility for bringing on a world-wide credit deflation.\" Thus we find that not only was the Federal Reserve System responsible for the First World War, which it made possible by enab ling the United States to finance the Allies, but its policies brought on the world-wide depression of 1929-31. Governor Adolph C. Miller stated at the Se nate Investigation of the Federal Reserve Board in 1931 that: \"If we had had no Federal Reserve System, I do not think we would have had as bad a speculative situation as we had, to begin with.\" Carter Glass replied, \"You have made it clear that the Federal Reserve Board provided a terrific credit expansion by these open market transactions.\" Emmanuel Goldenweiser said, \"In 1928-29 the Federal Board was engaged in an attempt to restrain the rapid increase in sec urity loans and in stock market speculation. The continuity of this policy o f restraint, however, was"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 165 interrupted by reduction in bill rates in the autum n of 1928 and the summer of 1929.\" Both J.P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb Co. had \"preferred lists\" of men to whom they sent advance announcements of profitable stock s. The men on these preferred lists were allowed to purchase these stoc ks at cost, that is, anywhere from 2 to 15 points a share less than they were sold to the public. The men on these lists were fellow bankers, promine nt industrialists, powerful city politicians, national Committeemen of the Republican and Democratic Parties, and rulers of foreign countries . The men on these lists were notified of the coming crash, and sold all but so-called gilt-edged stocks, General Motors, Dupont, etc. The prices on these st ocks also sank to record lows, but they came up soon afterwards. How the big bankers operated in 1929 is revealed by a Newsweek story on May 30, 193 6, when a Roosevelt appointee, Ralph W. Morrison, resigned from the Fed eral Reserve Board: \"The consensus of opinion is that the Federal Reser ve Board has lost an able man. He sold his Texas utilities stock to Insull for ten million dol lars, and in 1929 called a meeting and ordered his banks to close out all security loans by Septem ber 1. As a result, they rode through the depression with flying colors.\" Predictably enough, all of the big bankers rode thr ough the depression \"with flying colors.\" The people who suffered were the wo rkers and farmers who had invested their money in get-rich stocks, after the President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, and the Secretary of the T reasury, Andrew Mellon, had persuaded them to do it. There had been some warnings of the approaching cra sh in England, which American newspapers never saw. The London Statist o n May 25, 1929 said: \"The banking authorities in the United States appar ently want a business panic to curb speculation.\" The London Economist on May 11, 1929, said: \"The events of the past year have seen the beginnin gs of a new technique, which, if maintained and developed, may succeed in ‘rationing the specul ator without injuring the trader.’\""},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 166 Governor Charles S. Hamlin quoted this statement at the Senate hearings in 1931 and said, in corroboration of it: \"That was the feeling of certain members of the Boa rd, to remove Federal Reserve credit from the speculator without injuring the trader.\" Governor Hamlin did not bother to point out that th e \"speculators\" he was out to break were the school-teachers and small tow n merchants who had put their savings into the stock market, or that the \"t raders\" he was trying to protect were the big Wall Street operators, Bernard Baruch and Paul Warburg. When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised it s rate to six percent on August 9, 1929, market conditions began which culmi nated in tremendous selling orders from October 24 into November, which wiped out a hundred and sixty billion dollars worth of security values. That was a hundred and sixty billions which the American citizens had one month and did not have the next. Some idea of the calamity may be had if w e remember that our enormous outlay of money and goods in the Second Wo rld War amounted to not much more than two hundred billions of dollars, and a great deal of that remained as negotiable securities in the national d ebt. The stock market crash is the greatest misfortune which the United S tates has ever suffered. The Academy of Political Science of Columbia Univer sity in its annual meeting in January, 1930, held a post-mortem on the Crash of 1929. Vice- President Paul Warburg was to have presided, and Di rector Ogden Mills was to have played an important part in the discussion. However, these two gentlemen did not show up. Professor Oliver M.W. Sp rague of Harvard University remarked of the crash: \"We have here a beautiful laboratory case of the st ock market’s dropping apparently from its own weight.\" It was pointed out that there was no exhaustion of credit, as in 1893, nor any currency famine, as in the Panic of 1907, when clea ring-house certificates were resorted to, nor a collapse of commodity price s, as in 1920. What then, had caused the crash? The people had purchased stoc ks at high prices and expected the prices to continue to rise. The prices had to come down, and they did. It was obvious to the economists and bank ers gathered over their brandy and cigars at the Hotel Astor that the peopl e were at fault. Certainly the people had made a mistake in buying over-priced securities, but they had been talked into it by every leading citizen from t he President of the United States on down. Every magazine of national circulat ion, every big"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 167 newspaper, and every prominent banker, economist, a nd politician, had joined in the big confidence game of urging people to buy tho se over-priced securities. When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised it s rate to six percent, in August 1929, people began to get out of the market, and it turned into a panic which drove the prices of securities down far below their natural levels. As in previous panics, this enabled both Wall Stree t and foreign operators in the know to pick up \"blue-chip\" and gilt-edged\" sec urities for a fraction of their real value. The Crash of 1929 also saw the formation of giant h olding companies which picked up these cheap bonds and securities, such as the Marine Midland Corporation, the Lehman Corporation, and the Equity Corporation. In 1929 J.P. Morgan Company organized the giant food trust, Standard Brands. There was an unequaled opportunity for trust operat ors to enlarge and consolidate their holdings. Emmanuel Goldenweiser, director of research for the Federal Reserve System, said, in 1947: \"It is clear in retrospect that the Board should ha ve ignored the speculative expansion and allowed it to collapse of its own weight.\" This admission of error eighteen years after the ev ent was small comfort to the people who lost their savings in the Crash. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was the beginning of a world-wide credit deflation which lasted through 1932, and from which the Western democracies did not recover until they began to rea rm for the Second W orld War. During this depression, the trust operators ac hieved further control by their backing of three international swindlers, The Van Sweringen brothers, Samuel Insull, and Ivar Kreuger. These men pyramide d billions of dollars worth of securities to fantastic heights. The banke rs who promoted them and floated their stock issue could have stopp ed them at any time, by calling loans of less than a million dollars, but t hey let these men go on until they had incorporated many industrial and financial properties into holding companies, which the banks then took over for nothi ng. Insull piled up public utility holdings throughout the Middle West, which the banks got for a fraction of their worth. Ivar Kreuger was backed by Lee Higginson Company, supposedly one of the nation’s most reputa ble banking houses. The Saturday Evening Post called him \"more than a f inancial titan\", and the English review Fortnightly said, in an article writ ten December 1931, under the title, \"A Chapter in Constructive Finance\": \"It is as a financial irrigator that Kreuger has become of such vital importance to Europe.\"*"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 168 \"Financial irrigator\" we may remember, was the titl e bestowed upon Jacob Schiff by Newsweek Magazine, when it described how Schiff had bought up American railroads with Rothschild’s money. The New Republic remarked on January 25th, 1933, wh en it commented on the fact that Lee Higginson Company had handled Kre uger and Toll Securities on the American market: \"Three-quarters of a billion dollars was made away with. Who was able to dictate to the French police to keep secret the news of this extremely im portant suicide for some hours, during which somebody sold Kreuger securities in large amounts, thus getting out of the market before the debacle?\" The Federal Reserve Board could have checked the en ormous credit expansion of Insull and Kreuger by investigating th e security on which their loans were being made, but the Governors never made any examination of the activities of these men. The modern bank with the credit facilities it affor ds, gives an opportunity which had not previously existed for such operators as Kreuger to make an appearance of abundant capital by the aid of borrow ed capital. This enables the speculator to buy securities with securities. T he only limit to the amount he can corner is the amount to which the banks will back him, and, if a speculator is being promoted by a reputable banking house, as Kreuger was promoted by Lee Higginson Company, the only way he could be stopped would be by an investigation of his actual financia l resources, which in Kreuger’s case would have proved to be nil.

Me yer had been a Special Advisor to the War Industries Board on Non- Ferrous Metals (gold, silver, etc.); Special Assistant to the Secretary o f War on aircraft production; in 1917 he was appointed to the National Committee on War Savings, and was made Chairman of the War Finance Corporation fr om 1918-1926. He then was appointed chairman of the Federal Farm Loa n Board from 1927- 29. Hoover put him on the Federal Reserve Board in 1930, and Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Reconstruction Bank for Recon struction and Development in 1946. Meyer must have been a man of exceptional ability to hold so many important posts. However, there were s ome Senators who did not believe he should hold any Government office, b ecause of his family background as an international gold dealer and his mysterious operations in billions of dollars of Government securities in the First World War. Consequently, the Senate held Hearings to determine whether Meyer ought to be on the Federal Reserve Board. At these Hearings, Representative Louis T. McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, said: \"Eugene Meyer, Jr. has had his own crowd with him i n the government since he started in 1917. His War Finance Corporation personnel took over the Federal Farm Loan System, and almost immediately afterwards, the Kansas City Join Stock Land Bank and the Ohio Joint Stock Land Bank failed.\" REPRESENTATIVE RAINEY: Mr. Meyer, when he nominally resigned as head of the Federal Farm Loan Board, did not really cease his activities there. He left behind him an able body of wreckers. They are continuing his policies and consulting with him. Before his appoin tment, he was frequently in consultation with Assistant Secretary of the Tre asury Dewey. Just before his appointment, the Chicago Joint Land Stock Bank, the Dallas Joint Stock Land Bank, the Kansas City Joint Land Stock Bank, a nd the Des Moines Land Bank were all functioning. Their bonds"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 171 were selling at par. The then farm commissioner had an understanding with Secretary Dewey that nothing would be done without the consent and approval of the Federal Farm Loan Board. A few days afterwards, United States Marshals, with pistols strapped at their sid es, and sometimes with drawn pistols, entered these five banks and demande d that the banks be turned over to them. Word went out all over the Uni ted States, through the newspapers, as to what had happened, and these bank s were ruined. This led to the breach with the old Federal Farm Loan Board, and to the resignation of three of its members, and the appointment of Mr. Meyer to be head of that Board. SENATOR CAREY: Who authorized the marshals to take over the banks? REP. RAINEY: Assistant Secretary of the Treasury De wey. That started the ruin of all these rural banks, and the Gianninis bo ught them up in great numbers.\" World’s Work of February 1931, said: \"When the World War began for us in 1917, Mr. Eugen e Meyer, Jr. was among the first to be called to Washington. In April, 1918, President Wil son named him Director of the War Finance Corporation. This corporation loaned out 700 millio n dollars to banking and financial institutions.\" The Senate Hearings on Eugene Meyer, Jr. continued: REPRESENTATIVE MCFADDEN: \"Lazard Freres, the intern ational banking house of New York and Paris, was a Meyer fa mily banking house. It frequently figures in imports and exports of gold, and one of the important functions of the Federal Reserve System has to do w ith gold movements in the maintenance of its own operations. In looking o ver the minutes of the hearing we had last Thursday, Senator Fletcher had asked Mr. Meyer, ‘Have you any connections with international banking?’ Mr . Meyer had answered, ‘Me? Not personally.’ This last question and answer do not appear in the stenographic transcript. Senator Fletcher remembers asking the question and the answer. It is an odd omission. SENATOR BROOKHART: I understand that Mr. Meyer look ed it over for corrections. REPRESENTATIVE MCFADDEN: Mr. Meyer is a brother-in- law of George Blumenthal, a member of the firm of J.P.

Edmund Platt, wh o had eight years to go on a term of ten years as Governor of the Federal R eserve Board, resigned to make room for Mr. Meyer. Platt was given a Vice-Pre sidency of Marine Midland Corporation by Meyer’s brother-in-law Alfre d A. Cook. Eugene Meyer, Jr. as head of the War Finance Corporation, engaged in the placing of two billion dollars in Government securities, placed many of those orders first with the banking house now located at 14 Wall Street in the name of Eugene Mey er, Jr. Mr. Meyer is now a large stockholder in the Allied Chemical Corporat ion. I call your attention to House Report No. 1635, 68th Congress, 2nd Sessio n, which reveals that at least twenty-four million dollars in bonds were dup licated. Ten billion dollars worth of bonds surreptitiously destroyed. Our commi ttee on Banking and Currency found the records of the War Finance Corpo ration under Eugene Meyer, Jr. extremely faulty. While the books were b eing brought before our committee by the people who were custodians of them and taken back to the Treasury at night, the committee discovered that al terations were being made in the permanent records.\" The record of public service did not prevent Eugene Meyer, Jr. from continuing to serve the American people on the Fede ral Reserve Board, as Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and as head of the International Bank. President Rand, of the Marine Midland Corporation, questioned about his sudden desire for the services of Edmund Platt, sai d: \"We pay Mr. Platt $22,000 a year, and we took his s ecretary over, of course.\" This meant another five thousand a year. Senator Brookhart showed that Eugene Meyer, Jr. adm inistered the Federal Farm Loan Board against the interests of the Americ an farmer, saying: \"Mr. Meyer never loaned more than 180 million dolla rs of the capital stock of 500 million dollars of the farm loan board, so that in aiding the farme rs he was not even able to use half of the capital.\" MR. MEYER: Senator Kenyon wrote me a letter which s howed that I cooperated with great advantage to the people of Io wa. SENATOR BROOKHART: \"You went out and took the oppos ite side from the Wall Street crowd. They always send somebody ou t to do that.

You loaned only one-eighth of the dem and, according to your own statement.\" Despite the damning evidence uncovered at these Sen ate Hearings, Eugene Meyer, Jr. remained on the Federal Reserve Board. During this tragic period, chairman Louis McFadden of the House Banking and Currency Committee continued his lone crusade a gainst the \"London Connection\" which had wrecked the nation. On June 1 0, 1932, McFadden addressed the House of Representatives: \"Some people think the Federal Reserve banks are Un ited States Government institutions. They are not government institutions. They are private c redit monopolies which prey upon the people of the United States for the benefit of themselves and their fore ign customers. The Federal Reserve banks are the agents of the foreign central banks. Henry Ford has said, ‘The one aim of these financiers is world control by the creation of inextinguishable d ebts.’ The truth is the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the Government of the United States by the arrogant credit monopoly which operates the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve B anks.\" On January 13, 1932, McFadden had introduced a reso lution indicting the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for \"Criminal Co nspiracy\": \"Whereas I charge them, jointly and severally, with the crime of having treasonably conspired and acted against the peace and security of the Uni ted States and having treasonably conspired to destroy constitutional government in the United Sta tes.

McFadden ca me back on December 13, 1932 with a motion to impeach President Herbert Hoover. Only five Congressmen stood with him on this, and the resolut ion failed. The Republican majority leader of the House remarked, \" Louis T. McFadden is now politically dead.\" On May 23, 1933, McFadden introduced House Resoluti on No. 158, Articles of Impeachment against the Secretary of the Treasur y, two Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bo ard of Governors, and officers and directors of the Federal Reserve Banks for their guilt and collusion in causing the Great Depression. \"I charg e them with having unlawfully taken over 80 billion dollars from the U nited States Government in the year 1928, the said unlawful taking consisti ng of the unlawful recreation of claims against the United States Trea sury to the extent of over 80 billion dollars in the year 1928, and in each ye ar subsequent, and by having robbed the United States Government and the people of the United States by their theft and sale of the gold reserve of the United States.\" The Resolution never reached the floor. A whisperin g campaign that McFadden was insane swept Washington, and in the ne xt Congressional elections, he was overwhelmingly defeated by thousa nds of dollars poured into his home district of Canton, Pennsylvania. In 1932, the American people elected Franklin D. Ro osevelt President of the United States. This was hailed as the freeing of th e American people from the evil influence which had brought on the Great Depre s- sion, the ending of Wall Street domination, and the disappearance of the banker from Washington. Roosevelt owed his political career to a fortuitous circumstance. As Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I, because o f old school ties, he had intervened to prevent prosecution of a large ring o f homosexuals in the Navy which included several Groton and Harvard chums. Th is brought him to the favorable appreciation of a wealthy international h omosexual set which travelled back and forth between New York and Paris , and which was presided over by Bessie Marbury, of a very old and prominent New York family. Bessie’s \"wife\", who lived with her for a n umber of years, was Elsie de Wolfe, later Lady Mendl in a \"mariage de convena nce\", the arbiter of the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 175 international set. They recruited J.P. Morgan’s you ngest daughter, Anne Morgan, into their circle, and used her fortune to restore the Villa Trianon in Paris, which became their headquarters. During Worl d War I, it was used as a hospital. Bessie Marbury expected to be awarded t he Legion of Honor by the French Government as a reward, but J.P. Morgan, Jr., who despised her for corrupting his youngest sister, requested the F rench Government to withhold the award, which they did. Smarting from t his rebuff, Bessie Marbury threw herself into politics, and became a p ower in the Democratic National Party. She had also recruited Eleanor Roos evelt into her circle, and, during a visit to Hyde Park, Eleanor confided that she was desperate to find something for \"poor Franklin\" to do, as he was conf ined to a wheelchair, and was very depressed. \"I know what we’ll do,\" exclaimed Bessie, \"We’ll ru n him for Governor of New York!\" Because of her power, she succeeded in t his goal, and Roosevelt later became President. One of the men Roosevelt brought down from New York with him as a Special Advisor to the Treasury was Earl Bailie of J & W Seligman Company, who had become notorious as the man who ha nded the $415,000 bribe to Juan Leguia, son of the President of Peru, in order to get the President to accept a loan from J & W Seligman Comp any. There was a great deal of criticism of this appointment, and Mr . Roosevelt, in keeping with his new role as defender of the people, sent E arl Bailie back to @bringing in New York. Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was an international banker of ill repute, having floated large issues of foreign bonds in thi s country in the 1920s. These bonds defaulted, and our citizens lost millio ns of dollars, but they still wanted Mr. Roosevelt as President. The New York Dir ectory of Directors lists Mr. Roosevelt as President and Director of Un ited European Investors, Ltd., in 1923 and 1924, which floated many millions of German marks in this country, all of which defaulted. Poor’s Directory o f Directors lists him as a director of The International Germanic Trust Compan y in 1928. Franklin D. Roosevelt was also an advisor to the Federal International Banking Corporation, an Anglo -American outfit dealing in foreign securities in the United States. Roosevelt’s law firm of Roosevelt and O’Connor duri ng the 1920s represented many international corporations. His la w partner, Basil O’Connor, was a director in the following corporati ons: Cuban-American Manganese Corporation, Venezuela-Mex ican Oil Corporation, West Indies Sugar Corporation, America n Reserve Insurance Corporation, Warm Springs Foundation. He was direct or in other corporations, and later head of the American Red Cr oss."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 176 When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as President of the United States, he appointed as Director of the Budget James Paul Warb urg, son of Paul Warburg, and Vice President of the International Ac ceptance Bank and other corporations. Roosevelt appointed as Secretar y of the Treasury W.H. Woodin, one of the biggest industrialists in the co untry, Director of the American Car Foundry Company and numerous other loc omotive works, Remington Arms, The Cuba Company, Consolidated Cuba Railroads, and other big corporations. Woodin was later replaced b y Henry Morgenthau, Jr., son of the Harlem real estate operator who had helped put Woodrow Wilson in the White House. With such a crew as this , Roosevelt’s promises of radical social changes showed little likelihood of fulfillment. One of the first things he did was to declare a bankers’ moratorium, to help the bankers get their records in order. World’s Work says: \"Congress has left Charles G. Dawes and Eugene Meye r, Jr. free to appraise, by their own methods, the security which prospective borrowers o f the two billion dollar capital may offer.\" Roosevelt also set up the Securities Exchange Commi ssion, to see to it that no new faces got into the Wall Street gang, which caus ed the following colloquy in Congress: REPRESENTATIVE WOLCOTT: At hearings before this com mittee in 1933, the economists showed us charts which proved beyond all doubt that the dollar value commodities followed the price lev el of gold. It did not, did it? LEON HENDERSON: No. REPRESENTATIVE GIFFORD: Wasn’t Joe Kennedy put in [ as Chairman of the Securities Exchange Committee] by President Roosevelt because he was sympathetic with big business? LEON HENDERSON: I think so. Paul Einzig pointed out in 1935 that: \"President Roosevelt was the first to declare himse lf openly in favor of a monetary policy aiming at a deliberately engineered rise in prices. In a n egative sense his policy was successful. Between 1933 and 1935 he succeeded in reducing private inde btedness, but this was done at the cost of"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 177 increasing public indebtedness.\" In other words, he eased the burden of debts off of the rich onto the poor, since the rich are few and the poor many. Senator Robert L. Owen, testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1938, said: \"I wrote into the bill which was introduced by me i n the Senate on June 26, 1913, a provision that the powers of the System should be employed to promote a stable price level, which meant a dollar of stable purchasing, debt-paying power. It was stricken out. The powerful money interests got control of the Federal Reserve Board through Mr . Paul Warburg, Mr. Albert Strauss, and Mr. Adolph C. Miller and they were able to have that se cret meeting of May 18, 1920, and bring about a contraction of credit so violent it threw f ive million people out of employment. In 1920 that Reserve Board deliberately caused the Panic of 1921. The same people, unrestrained in the stock market, expanding credit to a great excess be tween 1926 and 1929, raised the price of stocks to a fantastic point where they could not po ssibly earn dividends, and when the people realized this, they tried to get out, resulting in the Crash of October 24, 1929.\" Senator Owen did not go into the question of whethe r the Federal Reserve Board could be held responsible to the public. Actu ally, they cannot. They are public officials who are appointed by the Presi dent, but their salaries are paid by the private stockholders of the Federal Res erve Banks. Governor W.P.G. Harding of the Federal Reserve Boar d testified in 1921 that: \"The Federal Reserve Bank is an institution owned b y the stockholding member banks. The Government has not a dollar’s worth of stock in it. \""},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 178 However, the Government does give the Federal Reser ve System the use of its billions of dollars of credit, and this gives the F ederal Reserve its characteristic of a central bank, the power to issu e currency on the Government’s credit. We do not have Federal Governm ent notes or gold certificates as currency. We have Federal Reserve B ank notes, issued by the Federal Reserve Banks, and every dollar they print is a dollar in their pocket. W. Randolph Burgess, of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stated before the Academy of Political Science in 1930 tha t: \"In its major principles of operation the Federal R eserve System is no different from other banks of issue, such as the Bank of England, the Bank of France, or the Reichsbank.\" All of these central banks have the power of issuin g currency in their respective countries. Thus, the people do not own t heir own money in Europe, nor do they own it here. It is privately pr inted for private profit. The people have no sovereignty over their money, and it has developed that they have no sovereignty over other major political issu es such as foreign policy. As a central bank of issue, the Federal Reserve Sys tem has behind it all the enormous wealth of the American people. When it beg an operations in 1913, it created a serious threat to the central banks of the impoverished countries of Europe. Because it represented this great wealth , it attracted far more gold than was desirable in the 1920s, and it was ap parent that soon all of the world’s gold would be piled up in this country. Thi s would make the gold standard a joke in Europe, because they would have no gold over there to back their issue of money and credit. It was the Fe deral Reserve’s avowed aim in 1927, after the secret meeting with the head s of the foreign central banks, to get large quantities of that gold sent ba ck to Europe, and its methods of doing so, the low interest rate and heav y purchases of Government securities, which created vast sums of n ew money, intensified the stock market speculation and made the stock mar ket crash and resultant depression a national disaster. Since the Federal Reserve System was guilty of caus ing this disaster, we might suppose that they would have tried to allevia te it. However, through the dark years of 1931 and 1932, the Governors of t he Federal Reserve Board saw the plight of the American people worsening and did nothing to help them. This was more criminal than the original plot ting of the Depression. Anyone who lived through those years in this countr y remembers the widespread unemployment, the misery, and the hunger of our people. At any time during those years the Federal Reserve Board c ould have acted to relieve this situation."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 179 The problem was to get some money back into circula tion. So much of the money normally used to pay rent and food bills had been s ucked into Wall Street that there was no money to carry on the business of living. In many areas, people printed their own money on wood and paper fo r use in their communities, and this money was good, since it repr esented obligations to each other which people fulfilled. The Federal Reserve System was a central bank of is sue. It had the power to, and did, when it suited its owners, issue millions of dollars of money. Why did it not do so in 1931 and 1932? The Wall Street bankers were through with Mr. Herbert Hoover, and they wanted Franklin D . Roosevelt to come in on a wave of glory as the saviour of the nation. Th erefore, the American people had to starve and suffer until March of 1933 , when the White Knight came riding in with his crew of Wall Street bribers and put some money into circulation. That w as all there was to it. As soon as Mr. Roosevelt took office, the Federal Rese rve began to buy Government securities at the rate of ten million do llars a week for ten weeks, and created a hundred million dollars in new money, which alleviated the critical famine of money and credit, and the factor ies started hiring people again. During the Roosevelt Administration, The Federal Re serve Board, insofar as the public was concerned, was Marriner Eccles, an e mulator and admirer of \"the Chief\". Eccles was a Utah banker, President of the First Securities Corporation, a family investment trust consisting o f a number of banks which Eccles had picked up cheap during the Agricul tural Depression of 1920-21. Eccles also was a director of such corpora tions as Pet Milk Company, Mountain States Implement Company, and Ama lgamated Sugar. As a big banker, Eccles fitted in well with the gro up of powerful men who were operating Roosevelt. There was some discussion in Congress as to whether Eccles ought to be on the Federal Reserve Board at the same time he had a ll of these banks in Utah, but he testified that he had very little to d o with the First Securities Corporation besides being President of it, and so h e was confirmed as Chairman of the Board. Eugene Meyer, Jr. now resigned from the Board to sp end more of his time lending the two billion dollar capital of the Recon struction Finance Corporation, and determining the value of collatera l by his own methods. The Banking Act of 1935, which greatly increased Ro osevelt’s power over the nation’s finances, was an integral part of the legi slation by which he proposed to extend his reign in the United States. It was not opposed by the people as was the National Recovery Act, because it was not so naked an infringement of their liberties. It was, however, a n important measure. First"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 180 of all, it extended the terms of office of the Fede ral Reserve Board of Governors to fourteen years, or, three and a half times the l ength of a Presidential term. This meant that a President assuming office who mig ht be hostile to the Board could not appoint a majority to it who would be favorable to him. Thus, a monetary policy inaugurated before a Presid ent came into the White House would go on regardless of his wishes. The Banking Act of 1935 also repealed the clause of the Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933, which had provided that a bank ing house could not be on the Stock Exchange and also be involved in inves tment banking. This clause was a good one, since it prevented a banking house from lending money to a corporation which it owned. Still it is to be remembered that this clause covered up some other provisions in that Act , such as the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, providin g insurance money to the amount of 150 million dollars, to guarantee fifteen billion dollars worth of deposits . This increased the power of the big bankers over small banks and gave them a nother excuse to investigate them. The Banking Act of 1933 also legi slated that all earnings of the Federal Reserve Banks must by law go to the ban ks themselves. At last the provision in the Act that the Government share in the profits was gotten rid of. It had never been observed, and the increas e in the assets of the Federal Reserve Banks from 143 million dollars in 1 913 to 45 billion dollars in 1949 went entirely to the private stockholders o f the banks. Thus, the one constructive provision of the Banking Act of 1933 w as repealed in 1935, and also the Federal Reserve Banks were now permitted t o loan directly to industry, competing with the member banks, who coul d not hope to match their capacity in arranging large loans. When the provision that banks could not be involved in investment banking and operate on the Stock Exchange was repealed in 1 935, Carter Glass, originator of that provision, was asked by reporter s: \"Does that mean that J.P. Morgan can go back into i nvestment banking?\" \"Well, why not?\" replied Senator Glass. \"There has been an outcry all over the country that the banks will not make loans. Now the Morgans can go back to underwriting.\" Because that provision was unfavorable to them, the bankers had simply clamped down on making loans until it was repealed. Newsweek of March 14, 1936, noted that: \"The Federal Reserve Board fired nine chairmen of R eserve Banks, explaining that ‘it intended"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 181 to make the chairmanships of the Reserve Banks larg ely a part-time job on an honorary basis.’\" This was another instance of the centralization of control in the Federal Reserve System. The regional district system had ne ver been an important factor in the administration of monetary policy, an d the Board was not cutting down on its officials outside of Washington . The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had asked, during the Gold Reserve Hearings of 1934: \"Is it not true, Governor Young, that the Secretary of the Treasury for the past twelve years has dominated the policy of the Federal Reserve Banks a nd the Federal Reserve Board with respect to the purchase of United States bonds?\" Governor Young had denied this, but it had already been brought out that on both of his hurried trips to this country in 192 7 and 1929 to dictate Federal Reserve policy, Governor Montagu Norman of the Bank of England had gone directly to Andrew Mellon, Secretary of th e Treasury, to get him to purchase Government securities on the open market a nd start the movement of gold out of this country back to Europe. The Gold Reserve Hearings had also brought in other people who had more than a passing interest in the operations of the Fe deral Reserve System. James Paul Warburg, just back from the London Econo mic Conference with Professor O.M.W. Sprague and Henry L. Stimson, came in to declare that he thought we ought to modernize the gold standard. Fr ank Vanderlip suggested that we do away with the Federal Reserve Board and set up a Federal Monetary Authority. This would have made no difference to the New York bankers, who would have selected the personnel anyway. And Senator Robert L. Owen, longtime critic of the system, made the following statement: \"The people did not know the Federal Reserve Banks were organized for profit-making. They were intended to stabilize the credit and currency supply of the country. That end has not been accomplished. Indeed, there has been the most remar kable variation in the purchasing power of money since the System went into effect. The Federa l Reserve men are chosen by the big banks, through discreet little campaigns, and they natural ly follow the ideals which are portrayed to"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 182 them as the soundest from a financial point of view .\" Benjamin Anderson, economist for the Chase National Bank of New York, said: \"At the moment, 1934, we have 900 million dollars e xcess reserves. In 1924, with increased reserves of 300 million, you got some three or four billion in bank expansion of credit very quickly. That extra money was put out by the Federa l Reserve Banks in 1924 through buying government securities and was the cause of the rapi d expansion of bank credit. The banks continued to get excess reserves because more gold came in, and because, whenever there was a slackening, the Federal Reserve people would put ou t some more. They held back a bit in 1926. Things firmed up a bit that year. And then in 1927 they put out less than 300 million additional reserves, set the wild stock market going, and that led us right into the smash of 1929.\" Dr. Anderson also stated that: \"The money of the Federal Reserve Banks is money th ey created. When they buy Government securities they create reserves. They pay for the G overnment securities by giving checks on themselves, and those checks come to the commercial banks and are by them deposited in the Federal Reserve Banks, and then money exists which did not exist before.\" SENATOR BULKLEY: It does not increase the circulati ng medium at all? ANDERSON: No. This is an explanation of the manner in which the F ederal Reserve Banks increased their assets from 143 million dollars to 45 billion dollars in thirty- five years. They did not produce anything, they wer e non-productive"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 183 enterprises, and yet they had this enormous profit, merely by creating money, 95 percent of it in the form of credit, which did not add to the circulating medium. It was not distributed a mong the people in the form of wages, nor did it increase the buying power of the farmers and workers. It was credit-money created by bankers for the use and profit of bankers, who increased their wealth by more than fo rty billion dollars in a few years because they had obtained control of the Government’s credit in 1913 by passing the Federal Reserve Act. Marriner Eccles also had much to say about the crea tion of money. He considered himself an economist, and had been broug ht into the Government service by Stuart Chase and Rexford Guy Tugwell, tw o of Roosevelt’s early brain-trusters. Eccles was the only one of the Roos evelt crowd who stayed in office throughout his administration. Before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 24, 1941, Governor Eccles said: \"Money is created out of the right to issue credit- money.\" Turning over the Government’s credit to private ban kers in 1913 gave them unlimited opportunities to create money. The Federa l Reserve System could also destroy money in large quantities through open market operations. Eccles said, at the Silver Hearings of 1939: \"When you sell bonds on the open market, you exting uish reserves.\" Extinguishing reserves means wiping out a basis for money and credit issue, or, tightening up on money and credit, a condition which is usually even more favorable to bankers than the creation of mone y. Calling in or destroying money gives the banker immediate and unl imited control of the financial situation, since he is the only one with money and the only one with the power to issue money in a time of money shortag e. The money panics of 1873, 1893, 1920-21, and 1929-31, were characterize d by a drawing in of the circulating medium. In economical terms, this does not sound like such a terrible thing, but when it means that people do no t have money to pay their rent or buy food, and when it means that an employe r has to lay off three- fourths of his help because he cannot borrow the mo ney to pay them, the enormous guilt of the bankers and the long record o f suffering and misery for which they are responsible would suggest that n o punishment might be too severe for their crimes against their fellowmen . On September 30, 1940, Governor Eccles said: \"If there were no debts in our money system, there would be no money.\""},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 184 This is an accurate statement about our money syste m. Instead of money being created by the production of the people, the annual increase in goods and services, it is created by the bankers out of the d ebts of the people. Because it is inadequate, it is subject to great fluctuations and is basically unstable. These fluctuations are also a source of great profi t. For that reason, the Federal Reserve Board has consistently opposed any legislation which attempts to stabilize the monetar y system. Its position has been set forth definitively in Chairman Eccles’ let ter to Senator Wagner on March 9, 1939, and the Memorandum issued by the Boa rd on March 13, 1939. Chairman Eccles wrote that: \". . . you are advised that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System does not favor the enactment of Senate Bill No. 31, a bill to amen d the Federal Reserve Act, or any other legislation of this general character.\" The Memorandum of the Board stated, in its \"Memoran dum on Proposals to maintain prices at fixed levels\": \"The Board of Governors opposes any bill which prop oses a stable price level, on the grounds that prices do not depend primarily on the price or cost of money; that the Board’s control over money cannot be made complete; and that steady aver age prices, even if obtainable by official action, would not insure lasting prosperity.\" Yet William McChesney Martin, the Chairman of the B oard of Governors in 1952, said before the Subcommittee on Debt Control, the Patman Committee, on March 10, 1952 that \"One of the fundamental purp oses of the Federal Reserve Act is to protect the value of the dollar.\" Senator Flanders questioned him: \"Is that specifica lly stated in the original legislation setting up the Federal Reserve System?\" \"No,\" replied Mr. Martin, \"but it is inherent in th e entire legislative history and in the surrounding circumstances.\""},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 185 Senator Robert L. Owen has told us how it was taken out of the original legislation against his will, and that the Board of Governors has opposed such legislation. Apparently Mr. Martin does not kn ow this. Steady average prices, indeed, are impossible so lo ng as we have the speculators on the stock exchange driving prices up and down in order to reap profits for themselves. Despite Governor Eccle s’ insistence that steady average prices would not insure lasting prosperity, they could do much to bring about this condition. A man on a yearly wage of $2,500 is not more prosperous if the price of bread increases five cen ts a loaf during the year. In 1935, Eccles said before the House Committee on Banking and Currency: \"The Government controls the gold reserve, that is, the power to issue money and credit, thus largely regulating the price structure.\" This is an almost direct contradiction of Eccles’ s tatement in 1939 that prices do not depend, primarily, on the price or cost of m oney. In 1935, Governor Eccles stated before the House Co mmittee: \"The Federal Reserve Board has the power of open ma rket operations. Open-market operations are the most important single instrument of control over the volume and cost of credit in this country. When I say \"credit\" in this connection, I mean money, because by far the largest part of mo ney in use by the people of this country is in the form of bank credit or bank deposits. When the Federal Reserve Banks buy bills or securities in the open market, they increase the volume of the people’s money and lower its cost; and when they sell in the open market they decrease the volu me of money and increase its cost. Authority over these operations, which affect the welfare of the whole people, must be invested in a body representing the national interest.\" Governor Eccles testimony exposes the heart of the money machine which Paul Warburg revealed to his incredulous fellow ban kers at Jekyll Island in"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 186 1910. Most Americans comment that they cannot under stand how the Federal Reserve System operates. It remains beyond understa nding, not because it is complex, but because it is so simple.

That is the Federal Reserve System. You then offer to buy this marvelou s money machine, but you cannot. It is owned by the private stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks, whose identities can be traced partially, bu t not completely, to \"the London Connection.\" At the House Banking and Currency Committee Hearing s on June 6, 1960, Congressman Wright Patman, Chairman, questioned Car l E. Allen, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ( p. 4). PATMAN: \"Now Mr. Allen, when the Federal Reserve Open Market Com mittee buys a million dollar bond you create the money on the credit of t he Nation to pay for that bond, don’t you? ALLEN: That is correct. PATMAN: An d the credit of the Nation is represented by Federal Reserve Notes in t hat case, isn’t it? If the banks want the actual money, you give Federal Reser ve notes in payment, don’t you? ALLEN: That could be done, but nobody wa nts the Federal Reserve notes. PATMAN: Nobody wants them, because t he banks would rather have the credit as reserves.\" This is the most incredible part of the Federal Res erve operation and one which is difficult for anyone to understand. How ca n any American citizen grasp the concept that there are people in this cou ntry who have the power to make an entry in a ledger that the government of th e United States now owes them one billion dollars, and to collect the princi pal and interest on this \"loan\"? Congressman Wright Patman tells us in \"The Primer o f Money\", p. 38 of going into a Federal Reserve Bank and asking to see their bonds on which the American people are paying interest. After bein g shown the bonds, he asked to see their cash, but they only had some led gers and blank checks. Patman says, \"The cash, in truth, does not exist and has never e xisted. What we call ‘cash reserves’ are simply bookkeeping credits entered upon ledgers of the Federal Reserve Banks. The credits are creat ed by the Federal Reserve Banks and then passed along through the banking system.\" Peter L. Bernstein, in A Primer On Money, Banking a nd Gold says:"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 187 \"The trick in the Federal Reserve notes is that the Federal reserve banks lose no cash when they pay out this currency to the member banks.

B ut since all Federal Reserve notes are themselves declared by law to be legal money, they are really redeemable only in themselves . . . they are an irredeemable obligation issued by the F ederal Reserve Banks.\"91 As Congressman Patman puts it, \"The dollar represents a one dollar debt to the Fed eral Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Banks create money out of thin air to buy Government bonds from the United States Treasury, lending mone y into circulation at interest, by bookkeeping entries of checkbook credi t to the United States Treasury. The Treasury writes up an interest bearin g bond for one billion dollars. The Federal Reserve gives the Treasury a o ne billion dollar credit for the bond, and has created out of nothing a one bill ion dollar debt which the American people are obligated to pay with interest. \" (Money Facts, House Banking and Currency Committee, 1964, p. 9) Patman continues, \"Where does the Federal Reserve system get the mone y with which to create Bank Reserves? Answer. It doesn’t get the money, it creates it. Wh en the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money. The Federal Reserve is a total mone ymaking machine. It can issue money or checks.\" In 1951, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York publi shed a pamphlet, \"A Day’s Work at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \" On page 22, we find that: \"There is still another and more important element of public interest in the operation of banks"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 188 besides the safekeeping of money; banks can ‘create ’ money.

Bernstein, A Primer On Money, Banking a nd Gold, Vintage Books, New York, 1965, p. 104 requirements by the Federal Reserve System. Selling bonds by the Open Market Committee also extinguishes and lowers the m oney supply. Buying government securities on the open market \"creates\" more money, as does lowering the interest rate and making money \"cheape r\". It is axiomatic that an increase in the money supply brings prosperity, and that a decrease in the money supply brings on a depression. Dramatic incre ases in the money which outstrip the supply of goods brings on inflat ion, \"too much money chasing too few goods\". A more esoteric aspect of t he monetary system is \"velocity of circulation\", which sounds much more t echnical than it is. This is the speed at which money changes hands; if it is gold buried in the peasant’s garden, that is a slow velocity of circul ation, caused by a lack of confidence in the economy or the nation. Very rapid velocity of circulation, such as the stock market boom of the late 1920s, me ans quick turnover, spending and investment of money, and its stems fro m confidence, or overconfidence, in the economy. With a high velocit y of circulation, a smaller money supply circulates among as many people and go ods as a larger money supply would circulate with a slower velocity of ci rculation. We mention this because the velocity of circulation, or confidence in the economy, also is greatly affected by the Federal Reserve actions. Mi lton Friedman comments in Newsweek, May 2, 1983, \"The Federal Reserve’s ma jor function is to determine the money supply. It has the power to inc rease or decrease the money supply at any rate it chooses.\" This is an enormous power, because increasing the m oney supply can cause the re-election of an administration, while decreas ing it can cause an administration to be defeated. Friedman goes on to criticize the Federal Reserve, \"How is it that an institution which has s o poor a record of performance nevertheless has so high a public reput ation and even commands a considerable measure of credibility for its forecasts?\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 189 All open market transactions, which affect the mone y supply, are conducted for a single System account by the Federal Reserve Bank o f New York on the behalf of all the Federal Reserve Banks, and superv ised by an officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The conferences a t which decisions are made to buy or sell securities by the Open Market C ommittee remain closed to the public, and the deliberations also remain a mystery. On May 8, 1928, The New York Times reported that Adolph C. Miller, Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, testifying before the House Banking and Currency Committee, stated that open market purchases and re discount rates were established through \"conversations\". At that time, the purchases on the open market amounted to seventy or eighty million dollar s a day, and would be ten times that today. These are vast sums to be man ipulated on the basis of mere \"conversations\", but that is as much informati on as we can obtain. Because of these mysterious transactions which affe ct the life, liberty and happiness of every American citizen, there have bee n numerous proposals such as Senate Document No. 23, presented by Mr. Lo gan on January 24, 1939, that \"The Government should create, issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of the consumers. The privileg e of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of Govern ment, but it is the Government’s greatest creative opportunity.\" On March 21, 1960, Congressman Wright Patman used a simple illustration in the Congressional Record of how banks \"create mo ney\". \"If I deposit $100 with my bank and the reserve req uirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Bank are 20% then the bank can make a loan to John Doe of up to $80. Where does the $80 come from? It does not come out of my deposit of $1 00; on the contrary, the bank simply credits John Doe’s accoun t with $80. The bank can acquire Government obligations by the same procedure, by simply creating deposits to the credi t of the government. Money creating is a power of the commer cial banks . . . Since 1917 the Federal Reserve has give n the private banks forty-six billion dollars of reserves.\" How this is done is best revealed by Governor Eccle s at Hearings before the House Committee on Banking and Currency on June 24, 1941: ECCLES: \"The banking system as a whole creates and extinguishes the deposits as they make"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 190 loans and investments, whether they buy Government Bonds or whether they buy utility bonds or whether they make Farmer’ s loans. MR. PATMAN: I am thoroughly in accord with what you say, Governor, but the fact remains that they created the money, did they not? ECCLES: Well, the banks create money when they make loans and investments.\" On September 30, 1941, before the same Committee, G overnor Eccles was asked by Representative Patman: \"How did you get the money to buy those two billion dollars worth of Government securities in 1933? ECCLES: We created it. MR. PATMAN: Out of what? ECCLES: Out of the right to issue credit money. MR. PATMAN: And there is nothing behind it, is ther e, except our Government’s credit? ECCLES: That is what our money system is. If there were no debts in our money system, there wouldn’t be any money.\" On June 17, 1942, Governor Eccles was interrogated by Mr. Dewey. ECCLES: \"I mean the Federal Reserve, when it carrie s out an open market operation, that is, if it purchases Government securities in the open market, it puts new money into the hands of th e banks which creates idle deposits. DEWEY: There are no excess reserves to use for this purpose?

FLETCHER: Chairman Eccles, when do you think there is a possibility of returning to a free and open market, instead of this pegged and artificiall y controlled financial market we now have? ECCLES: Never. Not in your lifetime or mine.\" Congressman Jerry Voorhis is quoted in U.S. News, A ugust 31, 1959, as questioning Secretary of Treasury Anderson, \"Do you mean that Banks, in buying Government securities, do not lend out their customers’ deposits? That they create the money they use to buy the secu rities? ANDERSON: That is correct. Banks are different from other len ding institutions. When a savings association, an insurance company, or a cre dit union makes a loan, it lends the very dollar that its customers have previ ously paid in. But when a bank makes a loan, it simply adds to the borrower’s deposit account in the bank by the amount of the loan. The money is not ta ken from anyone. It is new money, recreated by the bank, for the use of th e borrower.\" Strangely enough, there has never been a court tria l on the legality or Constitutionality of the Federal Reserve Act. Altho ugh it is on much the same shaky grounds as the National Recovery Act, or NRA, which was challenged in Schechter Poultry v. United States of America, 29 U.S. 495, 55 US 837.842 (1935), the NRA was ruled unconstitution al by the Supreme Court on the grounds that \"Congress may not abdicat e or transfer to others its legitimate functions. Congress cannot Constitut ionally delegate its legislative authority to trade or industrial associ ations or groups so as to empower them to make laws.\" Article 1, Sec. 8 of the Constitution provides that \"The Congress shall have power to borrow money on the credit of the United S tates . . . and to coin"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 192 Money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign C oin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures.\" According to the NRA deci- sion, Congress cannot delegate this power to the Fe deral Reserve System, nor can it delegate its legislative authority to the Fe deral Reserve System to allow the System to fix the rate of bank reserves, the re discount rate, or the volume of money. All of these are \"legislated\" by the Fede ral Reserve Board, meeting in legislative sessions to determine these matters and to issue \"laws\" or regulations fixing them. The Second World War gave the big bankers who owned the Federal Reserve System a chance to unload on the country bi llions of dollars printed early in 1930, in the biggest counterfeiting operat ion in history, all legalized by Roosevelt’s government, of course. Henry Hazlitt writes in the January 4, 1943 issue of Newsweek Magazine: \"The money that began to appear in circulation a we ek ago, December 21, 1942, was really printing press money in the fullest sense of the te rm, that is, money which has no collateral of any kind behind it .

We are losing some considerable amounts of gold during the war period. As our exports have gone out, largely on a lend-lease basis, we have taken imports on which we have given dollar balances.

FORD: I believe that the stabilization fund is entirely off the @OPA and consequently we ought to stick to the business at hand.\" The Congressmen never did get to discuss the Stabil ization Fund, another setup whereby we would give the impoverished countr ies of Europe back the gold which had been sent over here. In 1945, Henry Hazlitt, commenting in Newsweek of January 22, on Roosevelt’s annual budge t message to Congress, quoted Roosevelt as saying: \"I shall later recommend legislation reducing the p resent high gold reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve Banks.\" Hazlitt pointed out that the reserve requirement wa s not high, it was just what it had been for the past thirty years. Rooseve lt’s purpose was to free more gold from the Federal Reserve System and make it available for the Stabilization Fund, later called the International Monetary Fund, part of the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the equivalent of the League Finance Committee which would have swallowed the financial sovereignty of the United States if the Senate had let us join it."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 194 CHAPTER FOURTEEN Congressional Exposé \"Mr. Volcker’s politics is something of an enigma.\" --New York Times Since 1933 when Eugene Meyer resigned from the Fede ral Reserve Board of Governors, no member of the international banking f amilies has personally served on the Board of Governors. They have chosen to work from behind the scenes through carefully selected presidents of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other employees. The present chairman of the Federal Reserve Board o f Governors is Paul Volcker. His appointment was greeted by one well-kn own economist with the following prediction, \"Volcker’s selection has been by far the worst. Carter has put Dracula in charge of the blood bank. To us, it means a crash and depression in the 80s is more certain than ever.\" Col. E.C. Harwood’s Research Report, August 6, 1979 , gave much the same view. \"Paul Volcker is from the same mold as the un sound money men who have misguided the monetary actions of this nation for the past five decades. The outcome probably will be equally disastrous for the dollar and the U.S. economy.\" Despite these gloomy views, the report from The New York Times on the selection of Volcker was positively ecstatic. On Ju ly 26, 1979, The Times commented that Volcker learned \"the business\" from Robert Roosa, now partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, and that Volcke r had been part of the Roosa Brain Trust at the Federal Reserve Bank of Ne w York, and, later, at the Treasury in the Kennedy administration. \"David Rockefeller, the chairman of Chase, and Mr. Roosa were strong influe nces in the Mr. Carter decision to name Mr. Volcker for the Reserve Board chairmanship.\" The New York Times did not point out that David Rockefe ller and Robert Roosa had previously chosen Mr. Carter, a member of the T rilateral Commission, as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Par ty, or that Mr. Carter would hardly refuse to appoint their choice of Paul Volcker as the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Nor is it st raining the point to be reminded that this manner of selection of the Chair man of the Board of Governors is directly in the line of royal prerogat ive going back to George Peabody’s initial agreement with N.M. Rothschild, t o the Jekyll Island meeting, and to the enactment of the Federal Reserv e Act. The Times noted that \"Volcker’s choice was approved by European banks in Bonn, Frankfurt and Zurich.\" William Simon, former Secretary of Treasury, was quoted as saying \"a marvelous choice. \" The Times further noted that the Dow market rose on Volcker’s nominat ion, registering the best"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 195 gains in three weeks for a rise of 9.73 points, and that the dollar rose sharply on foreign exchange@ at home and abroad. Who was Volcker, that his appointment could have su ch an effect on the stock market and the value of the dollar in foreign exchange? He represented the most powerful house of \"the London Connection,\" Brown Brothers Harriman, and the London houses which directed the Rockefeller empire. On July 29, 1979, The Times had said of Volcker, \"N ew Man Will Chart His Own Course\". Volcker’s background shows that this was nonsense. His course has always been charted for him by his masters in London. He a ttended Princeton, obtained an M.A. at Harvard, and went to the London School of Economics 1951-52, the banker’s graduate school. He then came to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an economist from 1952-57, econ omist at Chase Manhattan Bank, 1957-61, with Treasury Department 1 961-65, as deputy under secretary for monetary affairs, 1963-65, and under secretary for monetary affairs, 1969-74. He then became President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1975-79, when Carter, at the behest of Robert Roosa and David Rockefeller, appointed him Chairman of th e Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was succeeded as President o f Federal Reserve Bank of New York by Anthony Solomon, a Harvard Ph.D. who was with the OPA 1941-42 and with the government financial mission t o Iran 1942-46. He operated a canned food company in Mexico from 1951- 61, was president of International Investment Corp. for Yugoslavia 1969- 72 (a communist country), under secretary for monetary affairs at T reasury 1977-80. In short, Solomon’s background was much the same as Paul Volc ker’s. The New York Times stated on December 2, 1981, \"For years the Federal Reserve was the second or third most secret institu tion in town. The Sunshine Act of 1976 penetrated the curtain a trifl e. The board now holds a public meeting once a week on Wednesday at 10 a.m., but not to discuss Monetary policy, which is still regarded as top sec ret and not to be discussed in public.\" The Times mentioned that when Open Mark et Committee meetings are held, Solomon and Volcker sit together at the head of the table and relay the instructions which they have received from abroad. Behind Volcker and Solomon stands Robert Roosa, Sec retary of the Treasury in Carter’s shadow cabinet, and representi ng Brown Brothers Harriman, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, and the Royal Economic Institute. He is a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation*, and a director of Texaco a nd American Express companies. Dr. Martin Larson points out that \"The i nternational consortium of financiers known as the Bilderbergers, who meet annually in profound secrecy to determine the destiny of the western wor ld, is a creature of the Rockefeller-Rothschild alliance, and that it held i ts third meeting on St."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 196 Simons Island, only a short distance from Jekyll Is land.\" Larson also states that \"The Rockefeller interests work in close alliance w ith the Rothschilds and other central banks.\"** On June 18, 1983, President Ronald Reagan ended mon ths of speculation by announcing that he was reappointing Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for another four year term, although Volcker’s term was not up until August 6, 1983. Rea gan’s reappointment of a Carter appointee puzzled some political observers, but apparently he had succumbed to considerable pressure, as indicated by a lead editorial in The Washington Post, June 10, 1983, \"There is no one wh o matches Mr. Volcker in both political standing and grasp of the intrica te networks that make up the world’s financial system.\" The anonymous writer gave no documentation for his elevation of Volcker to the standing of the world’s greatest financier, and as for his political standing, The New York Tim es commented on June 19, 1983, \"Mr. Volcker’s politics is something of a n enigma.\" His \"non- political\" stance conforms with the Washington trad ition of \"the political independence of the Fed\" which has been maintained for many years. However, the problem of its dependence on \"the Lond on connection\" has never been discussed in Washington. In reality, Volcker is more of a politician than an economist. After attending the London School of Economics, and finding out who issues the orders of the international financial community, Volcker has ever since played the game. Not once has he failed to carry out the order s of the \"London Connection\". Can it really be possible that \"The London Connecti on\" exists, and that men like Volcker and Solomon receive their instructions , in however devious or indirect a manner, from foreign bankers? Let us loo k at the evidence, circumstantial, to be sure, but circumstantial evid ence of the quality which has often sent men to the penitentiary or to the el ectric chair. John Moody pointed out in 1911 that seven men of the Morgan gr oup, allied with the Standard Oil-Kuhn, Loeb group, ruled the United Sta tes. Where do these groups stand in the financial picture today? U.S. News published on April 11, 1983, a list of th e largest bank holding companies in the United States by assets as of Dece mber 31, 1982. Number 1 is Citicorp, New York, with assets of $130 billion. This is Baker and __________________________ * See Chart V ** See Chart I Morgan’s First National Bank of New York, merged wi th National City Bank in 1955, two of the largest purchasers of Federal R eserve Bank of New York"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 197 stock in 1914. Number 3, is Chase Manhattan, New Yo rk, with assets of $80.9 billion. This is Chase and Bank of Manhattan merged , the Rockefeller and Kuhn Loeb group, also purchasers of Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock in 1914. Number 4 is Manufacturers Hanover of New York $64 billion, also purchaser of Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock in 1914. Number 5 is J.P. Morgan Company of New York, $58.6 billion in assets and holder of considerable Federal Reserve Bank stock. Number 6 i s Chemical Bank of New York, $48.3 billion also purchaser of Federal R eserve stock in 1914. And Number 11, First Chicago Corporation, the First Nat ional Bank of Chicago which was principal correspondent of the Morgan-Bak er bank in New York, and which furnished the first two presidents of the Federal Advisory Council. The direct line which leads from the participants i n the Jekyll Island Conference of 1910 to the present day is illustrate d by a passage from \"A Primer on Money\", Committee on Banking and Currency , U.S. House of Representatives, 88th Congress, 2d session, August 5, 1964, p. 75: \"The practical effect of requiring all purchases to be made through the open market is to take money from the taxpayer and give it to the dealers. It forces the Government to pay a toll for borrowing money. There are six ‘bank’ dealers: Firs t National City Bank of New York; Chemical Crop. Exchange Bank, New York, Morgan Guaranty Trus t Co., New York, Bankers Trust of New York, First Nat ional Bank of Chicago, and Continental Illinois Bank of C hicago.\" Thus the banks which receive a \"toll\" on all money borrowed by the Government of the United States are the same banks which planned the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. There is ample evidenc e demonstrating the present preeminence of the same banks which set up the Federal Reserve System in 1914. For instance, Warren Brookes writes on the editorial page of The Washington Post, June 6, 1983: \"Citicorp (National City Bank and First National Ba nk of New York, merged in 1955) just recorded an 18.6% return on equity, J.P. Morgan, 17 %, Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust, nearly 16%, an exceptional rate of return.\" These are the banks which bought the first issue of Federal Reserve Bank stock in 1914, and which owned the controlling inte rest in the Federal"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 198 Reserve Bank of New York, which sets the interest r ate and is the bank for all open market operations. These banks also profit steadily from the otherwise inexplicable fluctuations in monetary growth and interest rates. Brookes furt her comments on \"actual monetary growth rates alternately gyrating from 0 t o 17% in successive six month periods for three recession-wracked years. Th e two measures of money growth most admired by Milton Friedman M2 and M3, have actually shown little change on a year to year basis in the 1972-82 period.\" Thus we have money growth rates gyrating from 0 to 17% but no actual year to year changes, which raises the question of why w e cannot have stability of monetary growth throughout the year. The answer is that the big profits are made by these gyrations, and the next question is, who sets in motion these gyrations? The answer is \"the London Connection\". To draw attention from the continued control of the bankers and their heirs, who obtained the government monopoly of the nation’ s money and credit in 1913, the paid propagandists of the controlled medi a monopoly and academia are constantly trotting forth new and more exotic theories of economics. Thus James Burnham, one of the National Review propagandists, won fame with a ridiculous theory of \"the managers\" . He postulated that the old arbiters of wealth, the J.P. Morgans, the Warbu rgs and the Rothschilds had, by 1950, disappeared from the scene, being rep laced by a new class of \"managers\". This theory, which had no foundation in fact, served to obscure the fact that the same people still controlled the monetary system of the world. The \"managers\" were just that, executives li ke Volcker who were front men, paid employees who would continue to rec eive their paychecks only as long as they carried out their employers’ i nstructions. Burnham remains a well-paid propagandist at the National Re view, which many prominent leaders, including President Reagan, beli eve to be a \"conservative\" publication. From 1914 to 1982, a period in which many thousands of American banks went bankrupt, the original purchasers of Federal R eserve Bank stock have not only survived but they have consolidated their power. And what of \"the London Connection\"? Does it still exist, and is it still dictating the economic destiny of the United States? The Washington Post, May 19, 1983, carried a story datelined Nairobi, Kenya, noting the meeting of the African Development Bank. \"The British merchant bank, Morga n Grenfell and a syndicate of the United States, Kuhn Loeb, Lehman B rothers International, the French Lazard Freres and Britain’s Warburg are discreetly acting as financial advisors to about ten debt-plagued Africa n states.\""},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 199 There are the same names we encountered in 1914, st ill managing the finances of the world, with profits for themselves but with dis astrous results for everyone else. Perhaps we can look for relief to th e present Administration of President Reagan. Unfortunately, before reaching hi m we have to run the gamut of the long list of his principal staff, comp osed of men from J. Henry Schroder, Brown Brothers Harriman, and other leadin g components of \"The London Connection\". Lopez Portillo, President of Mexico, in addressing the Mexican National Congress of Mexico in September, 1982, called the w orld credit boom of the past decade a financial pestilence akin to the Blac k Death which swept Europe in the fourteenth century. \"As in mediaeval times, it flattens country after country. It is transmitted by rats and it yie lds unemployment and misery, industrial bankruptcy and enrichment by spe culation. The remedy prescribed by faith healers is forced inactivity an d depriving the patient of food.\" Forbes Magazine stated October 11, 1982, \"The world gasps for liquidity, not because the supply of money has contracted but beca use too much of it now goes to pay off old debts rather than fund new prod uctive investments.\" The policy of high interest rates and tight money h as been disastrous for the United States. In early 1983, a slight easing of mo ney and credit promises some relief, but as long as the Federal Reserve sys tem and its unseen manipulators continue their control of the money su pply, we can expect more problems. The Nation on December 11, 1982, in comme nting on economic problems, stated, \"The blame for all this lies at t he door of the Federal Reserve System working as usual on behalf of the in ternational banking system.\" The evidence of how the Federal Reserve System work s on behalf of the international banking system is graphically illustr ated by a series of charts drawn up by the staff of the Committee on Banking, Currency and Housing of the House of Representatives, 94th Congress, 2d session, August, 1976, \"FEDERAL RESERVE DIRECTORS: A STUDY OF CORPORATE AN D BANKING INFLUENCE\".* We present as our Chart V page 49 of this study, showing the interlocking directorates of Dav id Rockefeller.

Surely not banking or big business, if we are to judge from the massive interlocks reveale d by this analysis of the district boards. The big business and banking dominance of the Feder al Reserve System cited in this report can be traced, in part, to the original Federal Reserve Act, which gave member commercial banks the right to select two-thirds of the directors of each district bank. But the Board of Governors in Washington must share the responsibility for this i mbalance. They appoint the so-called \"public\" members of the boards of each district bank, appoin tments which have largely reflected the same narrow interests of the bank-elected members . . . . Until we have basic reforms, the Federal Reserve System will be handicapped in carrying out its public responsibilities as an economic stabilization and bank regulatory agency.

Currently, shares held by five of the above named b anks comprise 53% of the total Federal Reserve Bank of New York stock. A n examination of the major stockholders of the New York City banks shows clearly that a few families, related by blood marriage, or business in terests, still control the New York City banks which, in turn, hold the contro lling stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Knuth, in The Empire of the City, priv. printe d, 1946, p. 27, refers to \"the Bank of England, the full partner of the Ameri can Administration in the conduct of the financial affairs of all the wor ld\" and cites the Encyclopaedia Americana, 1943 edition. Barron cites Lord Swaythling, (April 8, 1923), \"Lor d Swaythling said, ‘Exchange can only be run from London. This is the center in Exchange.’\" (They Told Barron, by Clarence W. Barron, founder o f Baron’s Weekly, Harpers, New York, 1930, p. 27.) Exchange, in the international financial world, mea ns the transactions in money or securities, or simply, the \"exchange\" of t he values of these securities. It is necessary that this \"exchange\" ta ke place where the values can be established, and this place is the \"City\" in London. London was established as the primary center of exc hange because of the \"Consols\" of the Bank of England, bonds which could never be redeemed, but which paid a stable rate of return. Henry Clews writes, in The Wall Street View, Silver Burdett Co. 1900, p. 255, \"The Consolidated Act of 1757 consolidated the debts of the nation of England at 3%, which were kept in an account at the Bank of England and is the great bul wark of its deposits.\" By ostentatiously \"dumping\" \"Consols\" on the London Ex change after the Battle of Waterloo, in a pretended panic, Nathan Me yer Rothschild then secretly bought up the Consols sold in the panic by other holders at a low rate, and became the largest holder of Consols, and thus won control of the Bank of England in 1815. 12% Dividends Although a Labor government nationalized the Bank o f England in 1946, The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia points out (vol. I, p. 490c) that the Bank of England continues to pay 12% dividends per annum, j ust as it had done prior to the nationalization. The \"Governor\" is app ointed by the government, in a situation similar to that in the U nited States, where the Governors of the Federal Reserve System are appoint ed by the President. However, as is pointed out in the Encyclopaedia Ame ricana v. 13, p. 272, \"In practice, the governors of the Bank of England have not hesitated to criticize and bring pressure on the government in public.\" Bank Rate The interest rate set by the Bank of England is kno wn as \"the Bank rate\", and it is a controlling factor in interest rates th roughout the world,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 205 although rates in other countries may be higher or lower than this \"Bank rate\".

We should not be surprised that the present Governo r of the Bank of England, Sir Gordon Richardson is a prominent inter national financial figure, who appears elsewhere in these pages becaus e of his connection with the J. Henry Schroder @Wagg in London from 1962 to 1972, when he became Governor of the Bank of England. He was also director of J. Henry Schroder Co., New York, and Schroder Banking Corp., New York. He also serves as director of Rolls Royce and Lloyd’s Bank. Although he resides in London, he maintains a home in New York, and is lis ted in the current Manhattan directory simply as \"G. Richardson, 45 Su tton Place S.\", although a prior listing showed him at 4 Sutton Pla ce. Sutton Place was developed as a fashionable address for the internat ional set by Bessie Marbury, whom we earlier cited for her connection w ith the Morgan family and the Roosevelts. The present directors of the Bank of England (1982) include Leopold de Rothschild of N.M. Rothschild & Sons, Sir Robert Cl ark, chairman of Hill Samuel Bank, the most influential bank after Rothsc hilds, John Clay, of Hambros Bank, and David Scholey, of Warburg Bank, a nd joint chairman of S.C.

Anthony Sampson writes, in \"The Changing Anatomy of Britain\", Random House, New York, 1982, p. 279, \"The more cosmopolit an banks with foreign experts and directors, such as Warburgs, Montagus, Rothschilds and Kleinworts, had also discovered a huge new source o f profits in the market for Eurodollars which began in the late fifties and multiplied through the 60s . . .

The Washington Post commented on June 18, 1983 that after the American Revolution, all the old laws remained in e ffect in the new United States: Some of these laws of \"English common law\" dated back to 1278, long before America was discovered. This enormous financial power of \"the City\" is reve aled in many areas. Dean Acheson states, in \"Present at the Creation\", 1969, W.W. Norton, New York, p. 779, \"We stayed at the embassy residence, the ol d J.P. Morgan mansion, 14 Prince’s Gate, facing Hyde Park.\" How many Ameri cans are aware that the U.S. Embassy residence in London is the J.P. Mo rgan home, or that Dean Acheson, a former Morgan employee, described himsel f as Secretary of State on p. 505, \"My own attitude had long been, and was known to have been, pro-British.\" No one commented on an American Secre tary of State’s open bias in favor of England. The Federal Reserve \"created\" money is not used onl y for financial matters; this money is also used to maintain the bankers’ co ntrol of every aspect of political, economic and social life. It is used to bankroll the enormous expenditures of political candidates, the swollen b udgets of universities, the huge outlays required to start newspapers or magazi nes, and a vast array of foundations, \"think-tanks\" and other instruments of mind control.

In 1921, the Marquees of Tavistock, 11th Duke of Bedford, gave a building to a group which planned to conduct rehabilitation programs for shell shocke d British soldiers. The group took the name of \"Tavistock Institute\" after its benefactor. The General Staff of the British Army decided it was cr ucial that they determine the breaking point of the soldier under combat cond itions. The Tavistock Institute was taken over by Sir John Rawlings Reese , head of the British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau. A cadre of highl y trained specialists in psychological warfare was built up in total secrecy . In fifty years, the name \"Tavistock Institute’ appears only twice in the Ind ex of the New York Times, yet this group, according to LaRouche and other aut horities, organized and trained the entire staffs of the Office of Strategi c Services (OSS), the Strategic Bombing Survey, Supreme Headquarters of t he Allied Expeditionary Forces, and other key American milita ry groups during World War II. During World War II, the Tavistock In stitute combined with the medical sciences division of the Rockefeller Fo undation for esoteric experiments with mind-altering drugs. The present d rug culture of the United States is traced in its entirety to this Ins titute, which supervised the Central Intelligence Agency’s training programs. Th e \"LSD counter culture\" originated when Sandoz A.G., a Swiss pharm aceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg & Co., developed a new drug from ly sergic acid, called LSD. James Paul Warburg (son of Paul Warburg who ha d written the Federal Reserve Act in 1910), financed a subsidiary of the Tavistock Institute in the United States called the Institute for Polic y Studies, whose director, Marcus Raskin, was appointed to the National Securi ty Council. James Paul Warburg set up a CIA program to experiment with LSD on CIA agents, some of whom later committed suicide. This program, MK-Ultra, supervised by Dr. Gottlieb, resulted in huge lawsuits against the United States Government by the families of the victims. The Institute for Policy Studies set up a campus su bsidiary, Students for Democratic Society (SDS), devoted to drugs and revo lution. Rather than"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 208 finance SDS himself, Warburg used CIA funds, some t wenty million dollars, to promote the campus riots of the 1960s. The English Tavistock Institute has not restricted its activities to left-wing groups, but has also directed the programs of such supposedly \"conservative\" American think tanks as the Herbert Hoover Institute at Stanford University, Heritage Foundation, Wharton, Hudson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Rand. The \"sensitivity train- ing\" and \"sexual encounter\" programs of the most ra dical California groups such as Esalen Institute and its many imitators wer e all developed and implemented by Tavistock Institute psychologists. One of the rare items concerning the Tavistock Inst itute appears in Business Week, Oct. 26, 1963, with a photograph of its build ing in the most expensive medical offices area of London. The story mentions \"the Freudian bias\" of the Institute, and comments that it is amply financ ed by British blue-chip corporations, including Unilever, British Petroleum , and Baldwin Steel. According to Business Week, the psychological testi ng programs and group relations training programs of the Institute were i mplemented in the United States by the University of Michigan and the Univer sity of California, which are hotbeds of radicalism and the drug network. It was the Marquees of Tavistock, 12th Duke of Bedf ord, whom Rudolf Hess flew to England to contact about ending World War I I. Tavistock was said to be worth $40 million in 1942. In 1945, his wife com mitted suicide by taking an overdose of pills.

ALAN GREENSPAN (1926- ) Appointed by President Reagan to succeed Paul Volck er as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1987. Greenspan had succeeded Herbert Stein as chairman of the Presiden t’s Council of Economic Advisors in 1974. He was the protégé of former chai rman of the Board of Governors, Arthur Burns of Austria (Bernstein). Bur ns was a monetarist representing the Rothschild’s Viennese School of Ec onomics, which manifested its influence in England through the Roy al Colonial Society, a front for Rothschilds and other English bankers who stashed their profits from the world drug trade in the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank. The staff economist for the Royal Colonial Society was Alfred Marshall, inventor of the monetarist theory, who, as head of the Oxford G roup, became the patron of Wesley Clair Mitchell, who founded the National Bureau of Economic Research for the Rockefellers in the United States. Mitchell, in turn, became the patron of Arthur Burns and Milton Friedman, who se theories are now the power techniques of Greenspan at the Federal Re serve Board. Greenspan is also the protégé of Ayn Rand, a weirdo who inter posed her sexual affairs with guttural commands to be selfish. Rand was also the patron of CIA propagandist William Buckeley and the National Revi ew. Greenspan was director of major Wall Street firms such as J.P. Mo rgan Co., Morgan"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 210 Guaranty Trust (the American bank for the Soviets a fter the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917), Brookings Institution, Bowery Savings Bank, the Dreyfus Fund, General Foods, and Time, Inc. Greensp an’s most impressive achievement was as chairman of the National Commiss ion on Social Security from 1981-1983. He juggled figures to convince the public that Social Security was bankrupt, when in fact it had an enorm ous surplus. These figures were then used to fasten onto American work ers a huge increase in Social Security withholding tax, which invoked Davi d Ricardo’s economic dictum of the iron law of wages, that workers could only be paid a subsistence wage, and any funds beyond that must be extorted from them forcibly by tax increases. As a partner of J.P. Mor gan Co. since 1977, Greenspan represented the unbroken line of control of the Federal Reserve System by the firms represented at the secret meeti ng on Jekyll Island in 1910, where Henry P. Davison, righthand man of J.P. Morgan, was a key figure in the drafting of the Federal Reserve Act. Within days of taking over as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Greenspan immediately raised the interest rate on Sept. 4, 1987, the first such increase in three years of general prosperity, and precipitated the stock mark et crash of Oct., 1987, Black Monday, when the Dow Jones average plunged 50 8 points. Under Greenspan’s direction, the Federal Reserve Board ha s steadily nudged the United States deeper and deeper into recession, wit hout a word of criticism from the complaisant members of Congress.

The most frequently asked q uestions and the answers are as follows: Q: What is the Federal Reserve System? A: The Federal Reserve System is not Federal; it ha s no reserves; and it is not a system, but rather, a criminal syndicate. It is the product of criminal syndicalist activity of an international consortium of dynastic families comprising what the author terms \"The World Order\" (see \"THE WORLD ORDER\" and \"THE CURSE OF CANAAN\", both by Eustace M ullins). The Federal Reserve system is a central bank operating in the United States. Although the student will find no such definition o f a central bank in the textbooks of any university, the author has defined a central bank as follows: It is the dominant financial power of the country w hich harbors it. It is entirely private-owned, although it seeks to give t he appearance of a governmental institution. It has the right to print and issue money, the traditional prerogative of monarchs. It is set up t o provide financing for wars. It functions as a money monopoly having total power over all the money and credit of the people. Q: When Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913, did the Congressmen know that they were creating a central bank? A: The members of the 63rd Congress had no knowledg e of a central bank or of its monopolistic operations. Many of those who v oted for the bill were duped; others were bribed; others were intimidated. The preface to the Federal Reserve Act reads \"An Act to provide for th e establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic curren cy, to afford means of rediscounting commercial papers, to establish a mor e effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purpose s.\" The unspecified \"other purposes\" were to give international conspir ators a monopoly of all the money and credit of the people of the United St ates; to finance World War I through this new central bank, to place Ameri can workers at the mercy of the Federal Reserve system’s collection ag ency, the Internal Revenue Service, and to allow the monopolists to se ize the assets of their competitors and put them out of business. Q: Is the Federal Reserve system a government agenc y? A: Even the present chairman of the House Banking C ommittee claims that the Federal Reserve is a government agency, and tha t it is not privately owned. The fact is that the government has never ow ned a single share of Federal Reserve Bank stock. This charade stems from the fact that the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 224 President of the United States appoints the Governo rs of the Federal Reserve Board, who are then confirmed by the Senate. The se cret author of the Act, banker Paul Warburg, a representative of the Rothsc hild bank, coined the name \"Federal\" from thin air for the Act, which he wrote to achieve two of his pet aspirations, an \"elastic currency\", read (r ubber check), and to facilitate trading in acceptances, international tr ade credits. Warburg was founder and president of the International Acceptan ce Corporation, and made billions in profits by trading in this commerc ial paper. Sec. 7 of the Federal Reserve Act provides \"Federal reserve banks , including the capital and surplus therein, and income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal, state and local taxation, except taxes on real estate.\" Government buildings do not pay real estate tax. Q: Are our dollar bills, which carry the label \"Fed eral Reserve notes\" government money? A: Federal Reserve notes are actually promissory no tes, promises to pay, rather than what we traditionally consider money. T hey are interest bearing notes issued against interest bearing government bo nds, paper issued with nothing but paper backing, which is known as fiat m oney, because it has only the fiat of the issuer to guarantee these notes. Th e Federal Reserve Act authorizes the issuance of these notes \"for the pur poses of making advances to Federal reserve banks... The said notes shall be obligations of the United States. They shall be redeemed in gold on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States in the District of Columbia.\" Tourists visiting the Bureau of Printing and Engraving on th e Mall in Washington, D.C. view the printing of Federal Reserve notes at this governmental agency on contract from the Federal Reserve System for the nominal sum of .00260 each in units of 1,000, at the same price regardles s of the denomination. These notes, printed for a private bank, then becom e liabilities and obligations of the United States government and are added to our present $4 trillion debt. The government had no debt when the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913. Q: Who owns the stock of the Federal Reserve Banks? A: The dynastic families of the ruling World Order, internationalists who are loyal to no race, religion, or nation. They are fam ilies such as the Rothschilds, the Warburgs, the Schiffs, the Rockefe llers, the Harrimans, the Morgans and others known as the elite, or \"the big rich\". Q: Can I buy this stock? A: No. The Federal Reserve Act stipulates that the stock of the Federal Reserve Banks cannot be bought or sold on any stock exchange. It is passed on by inheritance as the fortune of the \"big rich\". Almost half of the owners of Federal Reserve Bank stock are not Americans."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 225 Q: Is the Internal Revenue Service a governmental a gency? A: Although listed as part of the Treasury Departme nt, the IRS is actually a private collection agency for the Federal Reserve S ystem. It originated as the Black Hand in mediaeval Italy, collectors of debt b y force and extortion for the ruling Italian mob families. All personal incom e taxes collected by the IRS are required by law to be deposited in the near est Federal Reserve Bank, under Sec. 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, \"The mone ys held in the general fund of the Treasury may be ....deposited in Federa l reserve banks, which banks, when required by the Secretary of the Treasu ry, shall act as fiscal agents of the United States.\" Q: Does the Federal Reserve Board control the daily price and quantity of money? A: The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, meeting in private as the Federal Open Market Committee with presidents of th e Federal Reserve Banks, controls all economic activity throughout th e United States by issuing orders to buy government bonds on the open market, creating money out of nothing and causing inflationary pressure, or, conv ersely, by selling government bonds on the open market and extinguishi ng debt, creating deflationary pressure and causing the stock market to drop. Q: Can Congress abolish the Federal Reserve System? A: The last provision of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, Sec. 30, states, \"The right to amend, alter or repeal this Act is express ly reserved.\" This language means that Congress can at any time move to abolish the Federal Reserve System, or buy back the stock and make it part of t he Treasury Department, or to altar the System as it sees fit. It has never done so. Q: Are there many critics of the Federal Reserve be side yourself? A: When I began my researches in 1948, the Fed was only thirty-four years old. It was never mentioned in the press. Today the Fed is discussed openly in the news section and the financial pages. There are bills in congress to have the Fed audited by the Government Accounting Office . Because of my expose, it is no longer a sacred cow, although the Big Three candidates for President in 1992, Bush, Clinton and Perot, joined in a unanimous chorus during the debates that they were pledged not to to uch the Fed. Q: Have you suffered any personal consequences beca use of your expose of the Fed? A: I was fired from the staff of the Library of Con gress after I published this expose in 1952, the only person ever discharged fro m the staff for political reasons. When I sued, the court refused to hear the case. The entire German edition of this book was burned in 1955, the only b ook burned in Europe"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 226 since the Second World War.

When I spoke recently in Wembley Arena in London, the pres s denounced me as \"a sinister lunatic\". Q: Does the press always support the Fed? A: There have been some encouraging defections in r ecent months. A front page story in the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 8, 1993 , stated, \"The current Fed structure is difficult to justify in a democracy. I t’s an oddly undemocratic institution. Its organization is so dated that ther e is only one Reserve bank west of the Rockies, and two in Missouri...Having a central bank with a monopoly over the issuance of the currency in a dem ocratic society is a very difficult balancing act.\""}]
