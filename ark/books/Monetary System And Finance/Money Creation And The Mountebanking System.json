This system subverts the legal and constitutional government and leads to socialism or fascism through favored corporate creation and control of the government's money and credit; directs the policies of government and holds in their hands the destiny of the people. (R. McKenna-Chairman of the Board and President of Midlands Bank of England--'National Economy and the Banking System', Senate Document Volume 3, #23, 76 th Congress, 1 st session) Aren't fractional reserve banking, interest (usury) and money (credit) creation together, the epitome of financial fraud? Here's how these schemes operate: FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING--Requires keeping only a small portion (percent) of a deposit on account for \"balance\". This allows lending more than actually exists, therefore receiving more overall interest. These banks are lending the same deposited sum multiple times, therefore getting multiple interests. Fractional Reserve banking amounts to a bank receiving excessive (compound) interest from one deposit. INTEREST/USURY--Cost for the use of another's money/credit. Today's interest was yesterday's usury. \"That species of sin which is called usury, and which has its proper seat and contract of lending, consists in this: that someone, from the loan itself, which of its very nature demands that only as much be returned as was received, wishes more to be returned to him than was received, and therefore contends that some profit beyond the principal, by reason of the lending, is due to him Therefore all profit of this sort, which surpasses the principal, is lawful and is usurious.\" (Encyclical 'Vix Pervenit' to the bishops of Italy, November 1 st , 1745) Usury originally meant lending money at interest, i.e., any increase, but has been changed to mean excessive rate of interest (increase) and is illegal. However, a net effect of excessive (compound) interest exists through various accrual methods; such as, when the increase is concealed through creative finance schemes devised for calculating/measuring interest and with miscellaneous (additional), i.e., other (hidden) finance charges attached The American Banking Association, like the American Bar Association (Guild), is a private Club or Union (closed shop) like a Masonic Order, and as such make their own rules & regulations. Banking regulation \"Z\" requires the lender/creditor to disclose all the terms & conditions of the contract (loan), like the APR (annual percentage rate) and total amount financed. What about repayment options? When buying a home are you informed that you can cut the term by approximately one third without making any prepayments (additional principle payments)? 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Here's a technique to accelerate the term without making prepayments. By paying a portion of your payment in advance you accelerate the term without any extra payments, but with the same effect. Paying a portion of payment in advance reduces the interest, term and overall cost of the loan without any additional payments. Example: A $100,000 loan @ 13% for 30 years. Your monthly payments would be $1,106.20. The total mortgage repayment after 30 years would be $398,232. But, by paying 1/2 ($553.10) every two weeks instead of the full amount ($1,106.20) once a month, you reduce the term by 11 years and pay $252,214 instead of $398,232, a savings of $146,018. This savings could be invested during the term of the loan and/or used for prepayments. (E. Mrkvicka Jr.--'The Bank Book', 1991) This method works for two reasons. First, since a mortgage is an amortized simple interest note you are charged the interest rate times the present outstanding balance, times the term between payments. So the sooner you make payments the less interest you owe. The less interest you owe allows more of your payment to be applied to principle. And the quicker you reduce the principle fastertheloan will be paid off. Second, you are also doing a biweekly since you are making additional payments even though you may not realize it, because there is an imbalance between the payment dates you will use and me calendar. Making twenty-six biweekly payments equals thirteen months, therefore accelerating your term by one month a year. This added payment also adds in reducing the interest due to your biweekly schedule. (ibid.) Why not take this a step further and make weekly payments of $276.55 per week for even better results? This technique virtually negates the devastating effects of interest. MONEY/CREDIT CREATION-Creating demand deposits (bank money) by making checkbook (computer) entries. The legal (statutory) authority & exclusive pre- rogative to use real wealth (human & natural resources) or debt for collateral & convert it to bank deposits (credit), then loan this (at interest) in the form of credit or currency. The IMF/Federal Reserve exercises this power as well as regulating the value (purchasing power) via contracting, withholding or extending credit and setting the prime interest rate. Price fixing? Monopoly? Sherman Antitrust Act? \"Federal Reserve bank credit does not consist of funds that the Reserve authorities get somewhere in order to lend, but constitute funds that they are empowered to create.\" ('Federal Reserve Bank; Its Purposes and Functions', 1939 Edition) \"A commercial bank is able to make a loan by simply creating a new demand deposit (so called checkbook money) through bookkeeping (computer) entry.\" (R.

He explained that the purpose for the Income Tax was to: 1) Control currency's purchasing power. 2) Redistribute national wealth. 3) Subsidize or penalize certain industries, groups and individuals. 4) Fund Federal benefits like highways and Social Security. Isn't your income tax an interest payment to Federal Reserve investors (stockholders), who don't have to pay any income tax on the gain/profit from their investment? Do you even owe an income tax? Why not ask the IRS to present the foundational instrument of agreement that you signed with the US that caused the investment of an income that generated a privilege that requires you file a return on a liability?

Tsar Alexander II threatened war with each of these countries if they invaded. This one reason alone instilled perpetual hatred against the Tsarist [Romanov] Dynasty by the bankers which culminated, of course, in the fake, so called Russian Revolution of 1917.\" (from the 'H' Document by James E.

When the Banks buy a billion dollars of government bonds as they are offered--and you have to consider the banking system as a whole, as a unit-the banks credit the deposit account of the Treasury with a billion dollars. They debit their government bond account a billion dollars, or they actually create, by book- keeping entry, a billion dollars.\" (M. Eccles, then Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in testimony before the Banking & Currency Committee of the House of Representatives on the Banking Act of 1935) \"Federal Reserve Banks create & destroy bank credit money, the money we do most our business with, not that currency which we usually think of as money.\" (M.

But if not in balance, the Nation's money is inflated and deflated and causes a boom or a depression.\" (I. Fischer-Professor Emeritus Yale Economics) \"Inflation is a method of taxation which the government uses to secure the command over real resources [human & natural]; resources just as real as those obtained by ordinary taxation. What is raised by printing notes is just as much taken from the public, asis an income tax. A government can live by this means, whenit can live by no other. It is the form of taxation that the public finds hardest to evade, and even the weakest government can enforce it when it can enforce no other.* By a continuous process of inflation, government can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate, they confiscate arbitrarily, and while the confiscation impoverishes many, it enriches some. Lenin was certainly right, There is no surer way of overturning a society, than to debauch the currency.'

If the extension of credit (a loan) is not the giving of value (UCC 3-303.7) and a holder who does not give value cannot qualify as a holder in due course (UCC 3-303.1), then how can a bank hold the title/deed to a house? \"The most sinister and anti-social feature about bank deposit money is that it has no existence. The banks owe the public for a total amount of money which does not exist. In buying and selling, implemented by check transactions, there is a mere change in the party to whom the money is owed by the banks. As the one depositor's account is debited, the other can go on owing for it all the time. * The whole profit of the issuance of money has provided the capital of the great banking business today.
