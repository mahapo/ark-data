[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Tenth Insight by James Redfield ACKNOWLEDGMENT S My heartfelt thanks to everyone who had a p art in this book, particularly Joan n Davis at War ner Books for her ongoing guidance and Albert Gaulden for his sage cou nsel. And certainly, MY friends in the Blue Ridge Mou ntains, who ke ep the fires of a safe haven burning. AUTHOR'S NO TE Like The Celestine Prophecy, this sequel is an adventure parable, an attempt to illustrate the ongoing spiritual transformation that is occu rring in our time. My hope with both books has been to com municate what I would cal l a con sensus picture, a lived portrait, of the new perceptions, feelings, and phenomena that are com ing to define life as we enter the third millennium. Our greatest mistake, in my opinion, is to think that human spirituality is somehow already understood and established. If history tells us anything, it is that human culture and knowledge are con stantly evolving. O nly individual opinions are fixed and dogmatic. T ruth is more dynamic than that, and the great joy of life is in letting go, in finding our own special truth that is ours to tell, and then watching the synchronistic way this truth evolves and takes a cl earer form, just when it's needed to impact someone's life. Together we are going somewhere, each generation building upon the accom plishments of the previous one, destined for an end we can only dimly remember. We 're all in the process of awakening and opening up to who we really are, and what we cam e here to do, which is often a ve ry difficult task. Y et I firmly believe that if we always integrate the best of the traditions we find before us and keep the process in mind, each challenge along the way, each interpersonal irritation can be overcom e with a sense of destiny and miracle. I don't mean to m inimize the formidable problems still facing humanity, only to suggest that each of us in our own way is involved in the solution. If we stay aware and ackn owledge the great mystery that is this life, we will see that we have been perfectly placed, in exactly the right position . . . t o m ake all the difference in the world. JR Spring, 1996 I looke d, and behold, a d oor was opened in heaven: an d the first voi ce which I heard was as ... a t rumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will show you the things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit: an d, behold, a throne was set in heaven.... an d there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment.... A nd I saw a n ew heaven and a n ew earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away....

Stretching acr oss my view was a large Appalachian valley of striking beauty, perhaps six or seven miles long and five miles wide. Along the length of the val ley ran a w inding stream that coursed through stretches of open meadowland and thick, col orful forests---ol d forests, with trees standing hundreds of feet high. I glanced down at the crude map in my hand. Eve rything in the val ley coincided with the drawing exactly: the steep ridge on which I was standing, the road leading down, the description of the landscape and the stream, the rolling foothills beyond. This had to be the place Charlene had sketched on the note found in her office. Wh y had she done that? And why had she disappeared? Over a m onth had now passed since Charlene had last con tacted her associates at the research firm where she worked, and by the time Frank Sims, her officemate, had thought to cal l me, he had becom e clearly alarmed. \"She often goes off on her own tangents,\" he had said. \"But she's never disappeared for this long before, and never when she had meetings already set with long-term clients. Something's not right.\" \"How did you know to cal l me?\" I asked. He responded by describing part of a letter, found in Charlene's office, that I had written to her months earlier chronicling my experiences in Peru. Wi th it, he told me, was a scribbled note that con tained my name and telephone number. \"I'm cal ling everyone I know who is associated with her,\" he added. \"So far, no on e seems to kn ow a thing. judging from the letter, you're a friend of Charlene's. I was hoping you had heard from her.\" \"Sorry,\" I told him. \"I haven't talked to her in four months.\" Even as I had said the words, I cou ldn't believe it had been that long. Soon after receiving my letter, Charlene had telephoned and left a long"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"message on my answering machine, voi cing her excitement about the Insights and com menting on the speed with which knowledge of them seemed to be spreading. I remembered listening to Charlene's message several times, but I had put off cal ling her back-t elling myself that I would call later, maybe tomorrow or the day after, when I felt ready to talk. I knew at the time that speaking with her would put me in the position of having to recall and explain the details of the Man uscript, and I told myself I needed more time to think, to digest what had occu rred. The truth, of cou rse, was that parts of the prophecy still eluded me. Certainly I had retained the ability to con nect with a spiritual energy within, a g reat com fort to m e con sidering that everything had fallen through with Maj orie, and I was now spending large am ounts of time alone. And I was more aware than ever of intuitive thoughts and dreams and the luminosity of a room or landscape. Yet, at the same time, the sporadic nature of the coi ncidences had becom e a p roblem. I would fill up with energy, for instance, discerning the question foremost in my life, and would usually perceive a cl ear hunch about what to do or where to go to pursue the answer yet, after act ing accor dingly, too of ten nothing of importance . w ould occu r. I would find no message, no coi ncidence. This was especially true when the intuition was to seek ou t someone I already knew to some extent, an old acq uaintance perhaps, or someone with whom I worked routinely. O ccas ionally this person and I would find some new point of interest, but just as frequently, my initiative, in spite of my best efforts to send energy, would be com pletely rebuked, or worse, would begin with excitement only to warp out of con trol and finally die in a flurry of unexpected irritations and emotions. Such failure had not soured me on the process, but I had realized something was missing when it cam e to living the Insights long-term. In Peru, I had been proceeding on momentum, often act ing spontaneously with a ki nd of faith born out of desperation. Wh en I arrived back h ome, though, dealing again with my normal environment, often surrounded by outright skeptics, I seemed to lose the keen expectation, or firm belief, that my hunches were really going to lead somewhere. Apparently there was some vital part of the knowledge I had forgotten . . . or perhaps not yet discove red. I'm just not sure what to do next,\" Charlene's associate had pressed. \"She has a sister, I think, somewhere in New York. Y ou don't know how to con tact her, do you? O r anyone else who m ight know where she is?\" \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"I don't. Charlene and I are act ually rekindling an old friendship. I don't remember any relatives and I don't know who her friends are now.\" \"Well, I think I'm going to file a p olice report, unless you have a better idea.\" \"No, I think that would be wise. Are there any other leads?\" \"Only a d rawing of some kind cou ld be the description of a p lace. It's hard to tell.\" Later he had faxed me the entire note he had found in Charlene's office, including the crude sketch of intersecting lines and numbers with vag ue"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"marks in the margins. And as I had sat in my study, com paring the drawing to the road numbers in an Atlas of the South, I had found what I suspected to be the act ual r. locat ion. Afterward I had experienced a vi vid image of Charlene in my mind, the same image I had perceived in Peru when told of the existence of a T enth Insight. Was her disappearance somehow con nected to the Man uscript? A wisp of wind touched my face and I again studied the view below. Far to the left, at the western edge of the val ley, I cou ld make out a row of rooftops. That had to be the town Charlene had indicated on the map. Stuffing the paper into m y vest pocke t, I made my way back t o the road and climbed into the Pathfinder. The town itself was small-population two thousand, accor ding to the sign beside the first and only stoplight. Mos t of the com mercial buildings lined just one street running along the edge of the stream. I drove through the light, spotted a m otel near the entrance to the Nat ional Forest, and pulled into a p arking space facing an adjacent restaurant and pub. Several people were entering the restaurant, including a tall man with a d ark com plexion and jet-black hair, car rying a large pack. H e glanced back at me and we momentarily made eye con tact. I got out and locke d the car , then decided, on a h unch, to walk through the restaurant before checking into the motel. Inside, the tables were near empty-just a few hikers at the bar and some of the people who had entered ahead of me. Mos t were oblivious to m y gaze, but as I con tinued to survey the room , I again met eyes with the tall man I had seen before; he was walking toward the rear of the room . H e smiled faintly, held the eye con tact another second, then walked out a b ack e xit. I followed him through the exit. H e was standing twenty feet away, bending ove r his pack. H e was dressed in jeans, a w estern J shirt and boots, and appeared to be about fifty years old. Be hind him, the late afternoon sun cas t long shadows am ong the tall trees and grass, and, fifty yards away, the stream flowed by, beginning its journey into the val ley. He smiled halfheartedly and looke d up at me. \"Another pilgrim?\" he asked. \"I'm looki ng for a friend,\" I said. \"I had a h unch that you cou ld help me.\" He nodded, studying the outlines of my body very car efully. Wal king closer, he introduced himself as David Lone Eag le, explaining, as though it was something I might need to kn ow, that he was a d irect descendant of the Nat ive Americans who or iginally inhabited this val ley. I noticed for the first time a thin scar on his face that ran from the edge of his left eyebrow all the way to his chin, just missing his eye. \"You want some cof fee?\" he asked. \"They're good at Perrier in the saloon there, but lousy at cof fee.\" He nodded toward an area near the stream where a small tent stood am ong three large poplars. Dozens of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"people were walking in the area, some of them along a p ath that crossed a bridge and led into the Nat ional Forest. Eve rything appeared safe. \"Sure,\" I replied. \"That would be good .\" At the cam psite he lit a small butane cam p stove, then filled a b oiler with water and set it on the burner. \"What's your friend's name?\" he finally asked. \"Charlene Bil4ings.\" He paused and looke d at me, and as we gazed at each other, I saw a cl ear image in my mind's eye of him in another time. H e was younger and dressed in buckskins, sitting in front of a large fire. Streaks of War paint adorned his face. Around him was a ci rcle of people, mostly Native Americans, but including two whites, a w oman and a ve ry large man. The discussion was heated. Some in the group wanted war; others desired reconciliation. H e broke in, ridiculing the ones con sidering peace. H ow cou ld they be so naive, he told them, after so m uch treachery? The white woman seemed to understand but pleaded with him to hear her cut. War cou ld be avoi ded, she maintained, and the val ley protected fairly, if the spiritual medicine was great enough. H e rebuked her argument totally, then, chiding the group, he mounted his horse and rode away. Mos t of the others followed. \"Your instincts are good ,\" David said, snapping me from my vision. H e was Spreading a h omespun blanket between us, offering me a seat. \"I ]know of her.\" He looke d at me questioningly. \"I'm con cerned\" I said. \"No on e has heard from her and I just want to make sure she's okay And we need to talk.\" \"About the TEnth Insight?\" he asked, smiling. \"How did you know that?\" \"Just a g uess. Man y of the people com ing to this val ley aren't just here because of the beauty of the Nat ional Forest. They're here to talk about the Insights. They think the Tenth is somewhere out there. A few even claim to kn ow what it says.\" He turned away and put a tea ball filled with cof fee into the steAming water. Something about his tone of voi ce made me think he was testing me, trying to ch eck ou t whether I was who I claimed. \"Where is Charlene?\" I asked. He pointed a finger toward the east. \"In the Forest. I've never meet your friend, but I ove rheard her being introduced in the restaurant one m and I've seen her a few times since. Several days ago I saw her again; she was hiking into the val ley alone, an4 judging from the way she was packe d, I'd say she's probably still out there.\" I looke d in that direction. From this perspective, the val ley was enormous, stretching forever into the distance. \"Where do you think she was going?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"He stared at me for a m oment. \"Probably toward the Sipsey Canyon. That's where one of the openings is found.\" He was studying my reaction. \"The openings?\" He smiled cryptically. \"That's right, the dimensional openings.\" I leaned ove r toward him, remembering my experience at the Celestine Ruins. \"Who kn ows about all this?\" \"Very few people. So far it's all rumor, bits and pieces of information, intuition. Not a soul has seen a m anuscript. Mos t of the people who com e here looki ng for the Tenth feel they're being synergistically led, and they're genuinely trying to live the Nine Insights, even though they com plain that the coi ncidences guide them along for a w hile and then just stop.\" He chuckled lightly. \"But that's where we all are, right? The Tenth Insight is about understanding this whole awareness-the perception of mysterious coincidences, the growing spiritual con sciousness on Ear th, the Ninth Insight disappearances-all from the higher perspective of the other dimension, so that we can understand why this transformation is happening and participate more fully\" \"How do you know that?\" I asked. He looke d at me with piercing eyes, suddenly angry. \"I know!\" For another moment his face remained serious, then his expression warmed again. H e reached ove r and poured the cof fee into two cu ps and handed one to m e. \"My ancestors have lived near this val ley for thousands of years,\" he continued. \"They believed this forest was a sacred site midway between the upper world and the middle world here on Ear th. My people would fast and enter the val ley on their vision quests, looki ng for their specific gifts, their medicine, the path they should walk in this life. \"My grandfather told me about a shaman who cam e from a faraway tribe and taught our people to search for what he cal led a state of purification. The shaman taught them to leave from this very spot, bearing only a knife, and to walk until the animals provided a sign, and then to follow until they reached what they cal led the sacred opening into the upper world. If they were worthy, if they had cleared the lower emotions, he told them, they might even be allowed to enter the opening, and to m eet directly with the ancestors, where they cou ld remember not just their own vision but the vision of the whole world. \"Of cou rse, all that ended when the white man cam e. My grandfather cou ldn't remember how to do it, and neither can 1. We're having to figure it out, like everyone else.\" \"You're here looki ng for the Tenth, aren't you?\" I asked. \"Of cou rse ... of cou rse! Bu t all I seem to be doing is this penance of forgiveness.\" His voi ce becam e sharp again, and he suddenly seemed to be talking more to himself than to m e. \"Every time I try to m ove forward, a p art of me can 't get past the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"resentment, the rage, at what happened to m y people. And it's not getting any better. H ow cou ld it happen that our land was stolen, our way of life ove rrun, destroyed? Wh y would that be allowed?\" \"I wish it hadn't happened,\" I said. He looke d at the ground and chuckled lowly again. \"I believe that. Bu t still, there is a rage that com es when I think of this val ley being misused. \"You see this scar,\" he added, pointing to his face. \"I cou ld have avoi ded the fight where this happened. Texas cow boys with too m uch to drink. I cou ld have walked away but for this anger burning within me.\" \"Isn't most of this val ley now protected in the Nat ional Forest?\" I asked. \"Only about half of it, north of the stream, but the politicians always threaten to sell it or allow development.\" \"What about the other half? Wh o ow ns that?\" \"For a long time, this area was owned mostly by individuals, but now there's a foreign-registered cor poration trying to buy it up. We don't know who is behind it, but some of the owners have been offered huge amounts to sell.\" He looke d away momentarily, then said, \"My problem is that I want the past three centuries to have happened differently. I resent the fact that Europeans began to settle on this con tinent with no regard for the people who were already here. It was criminal. I want it to have happened differently, as though I cou ld somehow change the past. O ur way of life was important. We were learning the val ue of remembering. This was the great message the Europeans cou ld have received from my people if they had stopped to listen.\" As he talked, my mind drifted into an other daydream. Two people-another Native American and the same white woman were talking on the banks of a small stream. Be hind them was a thick f orest. After a w hile, other Native Americans crowded around to hear their con versation. \"We can heal this!\" the woman was saying. \"I'm afraid we don't know enough yet,\" the Nat ive American replied, his face expressing great regard for the woman. \"Mos t of the other chiefs have already left.\" \"Why not? Think of the discussions we've had. You yourself said if there was enough faith, we cou ld heal this.\" \"Yes,\" he replied. \"But faith is a ce rtainty that com es from knowing how things should be. The ancestors know, but not enough of us here have reached that knowing.\" \"But maybe we can reach this knowledge now,\" the woman pleaded. \"We have to try!\" My thoughts were interrupted by the sight of several young Forest Service officers, who were approach ing an older man on the bridge. H e had neatly cut gray hair and wore dress slacks and a starched shirt. As he moved, he seemed to limp slightly."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Do you see the man with the officers?\" David asked. \"Yeah,\" I replied. \"What about him?\" \"I've seen him around here for the past two weeks. H is first name is Feyman, I think. I don't know his last name.\" David leaned toward me, sounding for the first time as if he trusted me com pletely \"Listen, something very strange is going on. For several weeks the Forest Service seems to have been cou nting the hikers who go into the forest. They've never done that before, and yesterday someone told me they have com pletely closed off the far eastern end of the wilderness. There are places in that area that are ten miles from the nearest highway. Do you know how few people ever venture out that far? Some of us have begun to hear strange noises in that direction.\" \"What kind of noises?\" \"A dissonance of some kind. Mos t people can 't hear it.\" Suddenly he was up on his feet, quickly taking down his tent. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"I can 't stay here,\" he replied. \"I've got to get into the val ley.\" After a m oment he interrupted his work an d looke d at me again. \"Listen,\" he said. \"There's something you have to kn ow. That man Feyman. I saw your friend with him several times.\" \"What were they doing?\" \"Just talking, but I'm telling you there's something wrong here.\" He began packi ng again. I watched him in silence for a m oment. I had no idea what to think about this situation, but I sensed that he was right about Charlene being somewhere out in the val ley. \"Let me get my equipment,\" I said. \"I'd like to go with you.\" \"No,\" he said quickly. \"Each person must experience the val ley alone. I can't help you now. It's my own vision I must find.\" His face looke d pained. \"Can you tell me exactly where this can yon is?\" \"Just follow the stream for about two m iles. You'll com e to an other small creek that enters the stream from the north. Follow this creek for another mile. It will lead you right through the mouth of the Sipsey Canyon.\" I nodded and turned to walk aw ay, but he grabbed my arm. \"Look, \" he said. \"You can find your friend if you raise your energy to another level. There are specific locat ions in the val ley that can help you.\" \"The dimensional openings?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"\"Yes. There you can discove r the perspective of the Tenth Insight, but to find these places you must understand the true nature of your intuitions, and how to m aintain these mental images. Also watch the animals and you'll begin to remember what you are doing here in this valley ... w hy we're all here together. But be very car eful. Don't let them see you enter the forest.\" He thought for a m oment. \"There's someone else out there, a friend of mine, Curtis We bber. If you see Curtis, tell him that you've talked to me and that I will find him.\" He smiled faintly and returned to folding his tent. I wanted to as k what he meant about intuition and watching the animals, but he avoi ded eye con tact and stayed focused on his work. \"Thanks,\" I said. He waved slightly with one hand. quietly shut the motel door and eased out into the moon light. The cool air and the tension sent a shiver through my body. Wh y, I thought, was I doing this? There was no proof that Charlene was still out in this val ley or that David's suspicions were cor rect. Yet my gut told me that indeed something was wrong. For several hours I had mulled ove r cal ling the local sheriff. Bu t what would I have said? That my friend was missing and she had been seen entering the forest of her own free will, but was perhaps in trouble, all based on a vag ue note found hundreds of miles away? Searching this wilderness would take hundreds of people, and I knew they would never mount such an effort without something more substantial. I paused and looke d at the three-quarters moon rising above the trees. My plan was to cr oss the stream well east of the rangers' station and then to proceed along the main path into the val ley I was cou nting on the moon to light my way, but not to be this bright. Visibility was at least a h undred yards. I made my way past the edge of the pub to the area where David had cam ped. The site was com pletely clean. H e had even spread leaves and pine straw to remove any sign of his presence. To cr oss where I had planned, I would have to walk ab out forty yards in plain sight of the rangers' station, which I cou ld now see clearly. Through the station's side window, two of ficers were busy in conversation. on e rose from his seat and picked up a telephone. Crouching low, I pulled my pack u p on my shoulders and walked out onto the sandy flood wash that bordered the stream, and finally into the water itself, sloshing through mounds of smooth river stone and stepping over several decayed logs. A symphony of tree frog--, and crickets erupted around me. I glanced at the rangers again: both were still talking, oblivious to m y stealth. At its deepest point, the moderately swift water reached my upper thigh, but in seconds I had moved acr oss the thirty feet of current and into a s tand of small pines, I car efully moved forward until I found the hiking path leading into the valley. Toward the east, the path disappeared into the darkness, and as I stared in that direction, more doubts entered my mind. Wh at was this"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"mysterious noise that so worried David? Wh at might I stumble upon in the darkness out there? I shook of f the fear. I knew I had to go on , but as a com promise, I walked only a h alf mile into the forest before making my way well off the path into a h eavily wood ed area to raise the tent and spend the rest of the night, glad to take off my wet boots and let them dry. It would be smarter to proceed in the daylight. The next morning I awoke at dawn thinking about David's cryptic remark about maintaining my intuitions, and as I lay in my sleeping bag, I reviewed my own understanding of the Seventh Insight, particularly the awareness that the experience of synchronicity follows a ce rtain structure. Accor ding to this Insight, each of us, once we work to cl ear our past dramas, can identify certain questions that define our particular life situation, questions related to ou r car eers, relationships, where we should live, how we should proceed on our path. Then, if we remain aware, gut feelings, hunches, and intuitions will provide impressions of where to go, what to do, with whom we should speak, in order to pursue an answer. After that, of cou rse, a coi ncidence was supposed to occu r, revealing the reason we were urged to follow such a cou rse and providing new information that pertained in some way to ou r question, leading us forward in our lives. H ow would maintaining the intuition help? Easing out of my sleeping bag, I pulled the tent flaps apart and checked outside. Sensing nothing unusual, I climbed out into the crisp fall air and walked back t o the stream, where I washed my face in the cool water. Afterward I packe d up and headed east again, nibbling on a g ranola bar and keeping myself hidden as much as possible in the tall trees that bordered the stream. After traveling perhaps three miles, a p erceptible wave of fear and nervousness passed through my body and I immediately felt fatigued, so I sat down and leaned against a tree, attempting to focus on my surroundings and gain inner energy. The sky was cloudless and the morning sun danced through the trees and along the ground around me. I noticed a small green plant with yellow blossoms about ten feet away and focused on its beauty. Already draped in full sunlight, it seemed brighter suddenly, its leaves a richer green. A rush of fragrance reached my awareness, along with the musty smell of leaves and black s oil. Simultaneously, from the trees far toward the north, I heard the cal l of several crows. The richness of the sound am azed me, but surprisingly I couldn't distinguish their exact locat ion. As I con centrated on listening, I becam e fully aware of dozens of individual sounds that made up the morning chorus: songbirds in the trees above me, a b umblebee among the wild daisies at the edge of the stream, the water gurgling around the rocks and fallen branches ... an d then something else, barely perceptible, a low, dissonant hum. I stood up and looke d around. What was this noise? I picked up my pack an d proceeded east. Be cause of the crunching sound created by my footsteps on the fallen leaves, I had to stop and listen very intensely to still hear the hum. Bu t it was there. Ahead the wood s ended, and I entered a large meadow, col orful with wildflowers and thick, two-foot-tall sage grass that seemed to go on for half a m ile. The breeze brushed the tops of the sage in currents. Wh en I had almost reached the edge of the meadow, I noticed a p atch of blackb erry brambles growing beside a fallen tree. The bushes struck m e as exceedingly"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"beautiful, and I walked ove r to look at them more closely, imagining that they were full of berries. As I did this, I experienced an acu te feeling of dj vu. The surroundings suddenly seemed very familiar, as though I had been here in this val ley before, eaten berries before. H ow was that possible? I sat down on the trunk of the fallen tree. Presently, A crow circled above the tree. At the same moment, I cou ld hear their caw ing again, although, as before, the loudness of their cries didn't match the distance; they sounded much closer. Splashing water and hissing steam pulled my attention back t o the cam p stove. Boi ling stew was ove rflowing onto the flame. I grabbed the pan with a towel, turning off the gas with the other hand. When the boiling subsided, I returned the pan to the burner and looke d back at the tree in the distance. The crows were gone. I hurriedly ate the stew, cleaned up, and packe d the gear, then headed into the can yon. As soon as I passed the bluffs, I noticed the col ors had am plified. The sage seemed am azingly golden, and I noticed, for the first time, that it was peppered with hundreds of wildflowers-white and yellow and orange. From the cliffs to the east, the breeze car ried the scent of cedar and pine. Although I con tinued to follow the creek running north, I kept my eye on the tall tree to m y left where the crows had circled. Wh en it was directly west of me, I noticed the creek was suddenly widening. I made my way through some willows and cat tails and realized I had com e to a small pool that fed not only the creek I was following but a second creek an gling off farther to the southeast. At first I thought this pool was the one I had seen in my mind, but there were no waterfalls. Ahead was another surprise: to the north of the pool, the creek had com pletely disappeared. Wh ere was the water com ing from? Then it dawned on me that the pool and the creek I had been following were all fed from an enormous underground spring surfacing at this locat ion. To m y left, fifty feet away, I noticed a m ild rise on which grew three sycam ore trees, each more than two feet in diameter-a perfect place to think for a m oment. I walked ove r and snuggled in among them, sitting down and leaning against the trunk of one of the trees. From this perspective, the two remaining trees were six or seven feet to m y front, and I cou ld look b oth to the left to see the crow tree and to the right to ob serve the spring. The question now was where to go from here. I cou ld wander for days without seeing any sign of Charlene. And what about these images? I closed my eyes and attempted to bring back t he earlier picture of the pool and waterfalls, but as much as I struggled, I cou ldn't remember the exact details. Finally I gave up and gazed out again at the grass and wildflowers and then at the two sycam ores right in front of me. Their trunks were a scaly col lage of dark gray and white bark, streaked with brush strokes of tan and multiple shades of am ber. As I focused on the beauty of the scene, these col ors seemed to intensify and grow more iridescent. I took an other deep breath and looke d out again at the meadow and flowers. The crow tree seemed particularly illuminated."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"I picked up my pack an d walked toward the tree. Immediately the image of the pool and waterfalls flashed acr oss my mind. This time I tried to remember the entire picture. The pool I saw was large, almost an acr e, and the water flowing into it cam e in from the rear, cas cading down a series of steep terraces. Two smaller falls dropped only about fifteen feet, but the last dropped over a long, thirty-foot bluff into the water below. Again, in the image that cam e to m ind, I seemed to be walking up to the scene, meeting someone. The sound of a ve hicle to m y left stopped me firmly in my tracks . I kneeled down behind several small bushes. From the forest on the left a gray jeep moved acr oss the meadow heading southeast. I knew that Forest Service policy prohibited private vehicles this far into the wilderness, so I expected to see a F orest Service insignia on the jeep's door. To m y surprise it was unmarked. When it was directly in front of me, fifty yards away, the vehicle stopped. Through the foliage I cou ld make out a lone figure inside; he was surveying the area with field glasses, so I lay flat and hid myself com pletely. Wh o was he? The vehicle started up again and quickly van ished out of sight in the trees. I turned and sat down, listening again for the hum. Still nothing. I thought about returning to town, of finding another way to search for Charlene. Bu t deep inside I knew there was no al ternative. I shut my eyes, and thought again of David's instruction to m aintain my intuitions, and finally retrieved the full image of the pool and falls in my mind's eye. As I got to m y feet and headed again toward the crow tree, I tried to ke ep the details of the scene in the back of my mind. Suddenly I heard the shrill cry of another bird, this time a h awk. T o my left, far past the tree, I cou ld barely make out her shape; she was streaking hard toward the north. I increased my pace, trying to ke ep the bird in sight for as long as possible. The bird's appearance seemed to increase my energy, and even after she had disappeared ove r the horizon, I kept moving in the direction she had been flying, walking for another mile and a h alf ove r a series of rocky foothills. At the top of the third hill, I froze again, hearing another sound in the distance, a sound much like water running. No, it was waterfalling. Carefully I walked down the slope and through a d eep gorge that evoke d another experience of deja vu . I climbed the next hill and there, beyond the crest, were the pool and falls, exactly as I had pictured them-except that the area was much larger and more beautiful than I had pictured. The pool itself was almost two acr es, nestled in a cr adle of enormous boulders and outcroppings, its crystal-clear water a sparkling blue under the afternoon sky. To the left and right of the pool were several large oak t rees, themselves surrounded by a m ulticolored array of smaller maples and sweet gums and willows. The far edge of the pool was an explosion of white spray and mist, the foam acce ntuated by the churning act ion of the two smaller falls higher up the ridge. I realized there was no runoff from the pool. The water went underground from here, traveling silently to emerge as the source of the large spring near the crow tree."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"As I surveyed the beauty of this sight, the sense of &j vu increased. The sounds, the col ors, the scene from the hill-it all looke d extremely familiar. I had been at this locat ion too. Bu t when? I moved down to the pool and then walked around the entire area, to the edge to taste the water, up the cas cades to feel the spray from each of the falls, ove r atop the large boulders, where I cou ld touch the trees. I wanted to immerse myself in the place. Finally I stretched out on one of the flatter rocks twenty feet above the pool and looke d toward the afternoon sun with my eyes closed, feeling its rays against my face. In that moment another familiar sensation swept acr oss my body-a p articular warmth and regard I hadn't sensed in months. In fact, until this instant, I had forgotten its exact feeling and character, although it was perfectly recognizable now. I opened my eyes and turned around quickly, certain of whom I was about to see. REVIEWI NG THE JOURNEY On a rock ab ove my head, half obscured by an ove rhanging ledge, stood Wil, his hands on his hips, smiling broad ly. H e appeared slightly out of focus, so I blinked hard and con centrated, and his face cleared somewhat. \"I knew you would be here,\" he said, nimbly climbing off the ledge and jumping to the rock b eside me. \"I've been waiting.\" I looke d at him in awe, and he pulled me into an embrace; his face and hands looke d slightly luminescent but otherwise seemed normal. \"I can 't believe you're here,\" I stammered. \"What happened when you disappeared in Peru? Wh ere have you been?\" He gestured for me to sit facing him on a n earby shelf. \"I'll tell you everything,\" he said, \"but first I have to kn ow about you. Wh at circumstances brought you to this val ley?\" In detail I told him about Charlene's disappearance, the map of the valley, and meeting David. Wi l wanted to kn ow more of what David had said, so I told him everything I cou ld remember about the conversation. Wil leaned toward me. \"He told you the Tenth was about understanding the spiritual renaissance on Ear th in light of the other dimension? And learning the true nature of your intuitions?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Is that right?\" He seemed to think for a m oment, then asked, \"What has been your experience since entering the val ley?\" \"I immediately started to see images,\" I said. \"Some were of other historical times, but then I began to see repeated visions of this pool. I saw everything: the rocks , the falls, even that someone was waiting here, although I didn't know it was you.\""},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"Where were you in the scene?\" \"It was as if I was walking up and seeing it.\" \"So it was a scene of a p otential future for you.\" I squinted at him. \"I'm not sure I follow.\" \"The first part of the Tenth, as David said, is about understanding our intuitions more fully. In the first nine Insights, one experiences intuitions as fleeting gut feelings or vag ue hunches. But as we gain familiarity with this phenomenon, we can now grasp the nature of these intuitions more clearly Think back t o Peru. Didn't intuitions com e to you as pictures of what was going to happen, images of yourself and others at a specific locat ion, doing certain things, leading you to go there? Was n't that how you knew when to go to the Celestine Ruins? \"Here in the val ley the same thing has been happening. You received a mental image of a p otential event-finding the falls and meeting someone-and you were able to live it out, bringing on the coi ncidence of actually discove ring the locat ion and encountering me. if you had shrugged off the image, or lost faith in looki ng for the falls, you would have missed the synchronicity, and your life would have stayed flat. Bu t you took t he image seriously; you kept it in your mind.\" \"David said something about learning to 'maintain' the intuition,\" I said. Wil nodded. \"What about the other images,\" I asked, \"the scenes of an earlier time? And what about these animals? Does the Tenth Insight talk ab out all this? H ave you seen the Man uscript?\" With a g esture of his hand, Wil waved off my questions. \"First, let me tell you about my experience in the other dimension, what I cal l the Afterlife dimension. Wh en I was able to m aintain my energy level in Peru, even when the rest of you grew fearful and lost your vibration, I found myself in an incredible world of beauty and clear form. I was right there in the same place, but everything was different. The world was luminous and awing in a w ay I still can 't describe. For a long time I just walked around in this incredible world, vibrating even higher, and then I discove red something quite amazing. I cou ld will myself anywhere on the planet, just by imaging a destination in my mind. I traveled everywhere I cou ld think of , looki ng for you and Julia an d the others, but I cou ldn't find any of you. \"Finally I began to detect another ability. By imaging just a b lank field in my mind, I cou ld travel off the planet, into a p lace of pure ideas. There I cou ld create anything I wanted just by imaging it. I made oce ans and mountains and scenic vistas, images of people who behaved just as I wanted, all kinds of things. And every bit of it seemed just as real as anything on Ear th. \"Yet in the end, I realized that such a con structed world was not a fulfilling place. Just creating arbitrarily gave me no inner"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"satisfaction. After a w hile, I went home and thought about what I wanted to do. A t that time I cou ld still becom e dense enough o that I could talk with most people of a h igher awareness. I cou ld eat and sleep, although I didn't have to. F inally I realized that I had forgotten about the thrill of evolving and experiencing coi ncidences. Because I was already so buoyant, I had mistakenly thought that I was maintaining my inner con nection, but in fact, I had becom e too controlling and had lost my path. It is very easy to lose one's way at this level of vibration, because it is so easy and instantaneous to create with one's will.\" \"What happened then?\" I asked. \"I focused within, looki ng for a h igher con nection with divine energy, just the way we've always done it. That's all it took; my vibration rose even higher and I began to receive intuitions again. I saw an image of you.\" \"What was I doing?\" \"I cou ldn't tell; the image was hazy. Bu t when I thought about the intuition and maintained it in my mind, I began to m ove into a n ew area of the Afterlife where I cou ld act ually see other souls, groups of souls really, and while I cou ldn't exactly speak t o them, I cou ld vag uely pick up on their thoughts and knowledge.\" \"Were they able to show you the Tenth Insight?\" I asked. He swallowed hard and looke d at me as though he was about to land a bombshell. \"No, the Tenth Insight has never been written down.\" \"What? It's not part of the original Man uscript?\" 'No. \"Does it even exist?\" \"Oh yes, it exists. Bu t not in the Ear thly dimension. This Insight hasn't made it to the physical plane yet. This knowledge exists only in the Afterlife. O nly when enough people on Ear th sense this information, intuitively, can it becom e real enough in everyone's con sciousness for someone to write it down. That's what happened with the first nine Insights. In fact, that's what has happened with all spiritual texts, even our most sacred scriptures. Always it is information that first exists in the Afterlife, and is finally picked up clearly enough in the physical dimension to be manifested by someone who is supposed to write it down. That's why these writings are cal led divinely inspired.\" \"So why has it taken so long for someone to grasp the Tenth?\" Wil looke d perplexed. \"I don't know. The soul group I was com municating with seemed to kn ow, but I cou ldn't quite understand. My energy level was not high enough. It has something to do with the Fear that arises in a cu lture that is moving from a m aterial reality to a transformed, spiritual worldview.\" \"Then you think the Tenth is ready to com e in?\" \"Yes, the soul groups saw the Tenth com ing in now, bit b"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"y bit, all ove r the world, as we gain a h igher perspective that com es from a kn owledge of the Afterlife. Bu t it has to be grasped in sufficient numbers, just as with the first nine, in order to ove rcom e the Fear.\" \"Do you know what the rest of the Tenth is about?\" \"Yes, apparently just knowing the first nine isn't enough. We have to understand how we will implement this destiny. Such knowledge com es from grasping the special relationship between the physical dimension and the Afterlife. We have to understand the birth process, where we com e from, the larger picture of what human history is trying to accom plish.\" A thought suddenly cam e to m e. \"Wai t a m inute. We ren't you able to see a cop y of the Ninth Insight? Wh at did it say about the Tenth?\" Wil leaned toward me. \"It said that the first nine Insights have described the reality of spiritual evolution, both personally and collectively, but act ually implementing these Insights, living them, and fulfilling this destiny requires a fuller understanding of the process, a Tenth Insight. This Insight would show us the reality of Ear th's spiritual transformation not just from the perspective of the Ear thly dimension but from the perspective of the Afterlife dimension as well. It said we would understand more fully why we were uniting the dimensions, why humans must fulfill this historical purpose, and it would be this understanding, once integrated into cu lture, that would ensure this eventual outcom e. It also m entioned the Fear, saying that at the same time a n ew spiritual awareness was emerging, a reactive polarization would also rise up in fearful opposition, seeking to willfully con trol the future with var ious new technologies-technologies even more dangerous than the nuclear menace-that are already being discove red. The Tenth Insight resolves this polarization.\" He stopped abruptly and nodded toward the east. \"Do you hear that?\" I listened but cou ld hear only the falls. \"What?\" I asked. \"That hum.\" \"I heard it earlier. Wh at is it?\" \"I'm not sure, exactly. Bu t it can be heard in the other dimension as well. The souls I saw seemed very disturbed about it.\" As Wil spoke , I clearly saw Charlene's face in the back of my mind. \"Do you think the hum is related to this new technology?\" I asked, partially distracted. Wil didn't answer. I noticed he had an absent look on his face. \"The friend that you're looki ng blond hair? And large eyes . 'Yes."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"I just saw an image of her face I stared at him. \"So did I.\" He turned and looke d at the falls for a m oment, and foland spray formed majesticly below his gaze.

Wil touched my lower back, gi,,ing me energy, smiling again. \"Don't you see how purposeful it IS that we are here?

As I said, we are leamin'- to recognize and believe in inquisitive-looki ng?\" our intuitions at a h igher level. We all want the coi ncidences to com e more con sistently, but for most of us, this awareness is new and we're surrounded by a cu lture that still operates too m uch in the old skepticism, so we lose the expectation, the faith. Yet what we are beginning to realize is that when we fully pay attention, inspecting the details of the potential future we're shown, purposely keeping the image in the back of our minds, intentionally believing-when we do this-then whatever we are imaging tends to happen more readily.\" \"Then we 'will' it to happen?\" \"No. R emember my experience in the Afterlife. There you can make anything happen just by wishing it so, but such creation isn't fulfilling. The same is true of this dimension, only everything moves"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"at a slower rate. O n Ear th, we can will and create almost anything we wish, but real fulfillment com es only when we first tune into ou r inner direction and divine guidance. O nly then do we use our will to m ove toward the potential futures we received. In this sense, we becom e cocr eators with the divine source. Do you see how this knowledge begins the Tenth Insight? We are learning to use our visualization in the same way it is used in the Afterlife, and when we do, we fall into al ignment with that dimension, and that helps unite Heaven and Ear th.\" I nodded, understanding com pletely After taking several deep breaths, Wil exerted more pressure on my back an d instructed me to re-create the details of Charlene's face. For a m oment nothing happened, and then suddenly I felt a rush of energy, twisting me forward and pushing me into a w ild acce leration. I was streaking at fantastic speeds though a m ulticolored tunnel of some kind. Fully con scious, I wondered why I had no fear, for what I really felt was a sense of recognition and con tentment and peace, as though I had been here before. Wh en the movement stopped, I found myself in an environment of warm, white light. I looke d for Wil and realized he was standing to m y left and slightly behind me. \"There you are,\" he said, smiling. H is lips weren't moving, but I cou ld clearly hear his voi ce. I then noticed the appearance of his body. H e looke d exactly the same, except he seemed to be com pletely illuminated from within. I reached ove r to touch his hand and noticed that my body appeared the same way. Wh en I touched him, what I felt was a field several inches outside the arm I cou ld see. Pushing harder, I realized I cou ldn't penetrate this energy; I only moved his body away from me. Wil was near bursting with mirth. in fact, his expression was so humorous that I laughed myself. \"Amazing, isn't it?\" he asked. \"This is a h igher vibration than at the Celestine Ruins,\" I replied. \"Do you know where we are?\" Wil was silent, gazing out at our surroundings. We seemed to be in an environment that was spatial, and we had a sense of up and down, but we were suspended motionless in midair and there were no horizons. The white light was a con stant hue in all directions. Finally Wil said, \"This is an observation point; I cam e here briefly, when I first imaged your face. Mor e souls were here.\" \"What were they doing?\" \"Observing the people who had com e ove r after death.\" \"What? You mean this is where people com e right after they have died?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why are we here? H as something happened to Charlene?\" He turned more directly toward me. \"No, I don't think so."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Remember what happened to m e when I began to image you. I moved to m any locat ions before we finally met at the falls. There's probably something we need to see here before we can find Charlene. Let's wait and see what happens with these souls.\" He nodded to ou r left, where several humanlike entities were materializing directly in front of us, at a d istance of what appeared to be about thirty feet. My first reaction was to be cau tious. \"Wil, how do we know their intentions are friendly? Wh at if they try to possess us or something?\" He gave me a serious expression. \"How do you know if someone on Ear th is trying to con trol you?\" \"I would pick u p on it. I cou ld tell that the person was being manipulative.\" \"What else?\" \"I guess they would be taking energy away from me. I would feel a decrease in my sense of wisdom, self-direction.\" \"Exactly. They wouldn't be following the Insights. All these principles work the same way in both dimensions.\" As the entities formed com pletely, I remained cau tious. Bu t eventually I felt a loving and supportive energy emanating from their bodies, which seemed to be com prised of a w hitish-am ber light that danced and shimmered in and out of focus. Their faces had human characteristics but cou ld not be looke d at directly. I cou ldn't even tell how many souls were there. At one moment, three or four seemed to be facing us, then I would blink an d there would be six, then three again, all dancing in and out of view. O verall, they looke d like a flickering, animated cloud of am ber, against the backg round col or of white. After several minutes, another form began to m aterialize be side the others, only this figure was more clearly in focus and appeared in a luminous body similar to Wi l and myself. We cou ld see that it was a m iddle-aged man; he looke d around wildly, then saw the group of souls and began to relax. To m y surprise, when I focused closely on him, I cou ld pick u p on what he was feeling and thinking. I glanced at Wil, who nodded that he was also sensing the person's reaction. I focused again and observed that, in spite of a ce rtain detachment and sense of love and support, he was in a state of shock at having discove red he had died. O nly minutes before, he had been routinely jogging, and while attempting to run up a long hill, had suffered a massive heart attack. T he pain had lasted only a few seconds, and then he was hovering outside his body, watching a stream of bystanders rush up to help him. Soon a team of paramedics arrived and worked feverishly to bring him back. As he sat b side his body in the am bulance, he had listened in horror as the team leader had pronounced him dead. Frantically he had attempted to com municate, but no on e cou ld hear."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"At the hospital a d octor con firmed to the crew that his heart had literally exploded; that no on e cou ld have done anything to save his life. Part of him tried to acce pt the fact; another resisted. H ow cou ld he be dead? H e had cal led out for help and had instantly found himself in a tunnel of col ors that had brought him to where he now stood . As we watched, he seemed to becom e more aware of the souls and moved toward them, shifting out of focus to us, appearing more like them. Then abruptly he pulled back t oward us and was quickly surrounded by an office of some kind, filled with com puters and wall charts and people working. Eve rything looke d perfectly real, except the walls were semitransparent, so that we cou ld see what was happening inside, and the sky above the office was not blue, but a strange olive col or. \"He's deluding himself,\" Wil said. \"He's re-creating the office where he worked on Ear th, trying to pretend he hasn't died.\" The souls moved closer and others cam e until there were dozens of them, all flickering in and out of focus in the am ber light. They seemed to be sending the man love and some kind of information I cou ldn't understand. G radually the con structed office began to fade and eventually disappeared com pletely. The man was left with an expression of resignation on his face, and he again moved into focus with the souls. \"Let's go with them,\" I heard Wil say. At the same moment, I felt his arm, or rather, the energy of his arm, pushing against my back. As soon as I inwardly agreed, there was the slight sensation of movement, and the souls and the man all cam e into cl earer focus. The souls now had glowing faces much as Wil and I did, but their hands and feet, instead of being clearly formed, were mere radiations of light. I could now focus on the entities for as long as four or five seconds before losing them and having to blink to find them again. I becam e aware that the group of souls, as well as the deceased individual, was watching an intense point of bright light moving toward us. It eventually swelled into a m assive beam that cove red everything. Unable to look d irectly at the light, I turned so I cou ld just see the silhouette of the man, who was staring fully at the beam without apparent difficulty. Again I cou ld pick u p on his thoughts and emotions. The light was filling him with an unimaginable sense of love and cal m perspective. As this sensation swept ove r him, his viewpoint and knowledge expanded until he cou ld clearly see the life he had just lived from a b road and am azingly detailed perspective. immediately he cou ld see the circumstances of his birth and early family life. H e was born John Donald Williams to a f ather who was slow intellectually and to a m other who was extremely detached an d absent because of her involvement in var ious social events. H e himself had grown up angry and defiant, an interrogator eager to prove to the world that he was a b rilliant ach iever who cou ld master science and mathematics. H e earned a d octorate in physics at MIT at age twenty-three and taught at four prestigious universities before moving"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"on to the Defense Department and then later to ' a p rivate energy corporation. Clearly he had thrown himself into this latter position with total abandon and disregard for his health. After years of fast food and no exercise he was diagnosed with a ch ronic heart con dition. An exercise routine pursued too ag gressively had proved fatal. He had died in his prime at age fifty-eight. At this point Williams' awareness shifted and he began to have profound rerets and severe emotional pain con cerning the way he had led hs life. He realized that his childhood and early family had been set up perfectly to expose what was already his soul's tendency to use defiance and elitism to feel more important. H is main tool had been ridicule, putting down others by criticizing their abilities and work ethic an d personality. Yet now he cou ld see that all the teachers had been in place to help him ove rcom e this insecurity. All of them had arrived at just the right time to show him another way. but he had ignored them corn pletely. Instead he had just pursued his tunnel vision to the end. All the signs had been there to ch oose his work m ore car efully, to slow down. There. were a m ultitude of implications and dangers inherent in his research of new technologies that he had failed to consider. H e had allowed his employers to feed him new theories, and even unfamiliar physical principles, without even quesLioning their origin. The se procedures worked, and that was all he car ed about, because they led to success, gratitude, recognition. H e had succumbed to his need for recognition ... ag ain. My God, he thought, I've failed just as I did before. His mind abruptly shifted to a n ew scene, an earlier existence. H e was in the sou them Appalachians, nineteenth century, a m ilitary outpost. In a large tent several men leaned ove r a m ap. Lanterns flickered their light against the walls. A con sensus had been reached am ong all the field officers present: there was no hope for peace now. War was inevitable, and sound military principles dictated an attack, quickly. As one of the com manding general's top two ai des, Williams had been forced to con cur with the others. No ot her choice existed, he had concluded; disagreement would have ended his car eer. Be sides, he couldn't have dissuaded the others even if he had wanted to. T he offensive would have to be car ried out, likely the last major battle in the eastern war against the Nat ives. A sentry interrupted with a com munication for the general. A settler wanted to see the com mander immediately. Looki ng through the open tent flap, Williams had seen the frail white woman, perhaps thirty, desperation in her eyes. H e found out later that she was the daughter of a m issionary, bringing word of a p ossible new Nat ive American initiative for peace, an appeal that she personally had negotiated at great risk. But the general had refused to see her, remaining in the tent as she shouted at him, finally ordering her from his cam p at gunpoint, not"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"knowing the con tent of her message, not wanting to kn ow. Again Williams kept quiet. H e knew his com mander was under great pressure, having already promised that the region would be opened up for economic expansion. A war was necessary if the vision of the power broke rs and their political allies was to be act ualized. It was not enough to let the settlers and the Indians create their own frontier culture. No, in their view, the future had to be shaped and manipulated and con trolled for the best interests of those who m ade the world secure and abundant. It would be far too f rightening and altogether irresponsible to let the little people decide. Williams knew that a w ar would greatly please the railroad and coal tycoon s and the newly emerging oil interests, and would, of cou rse, ensure his own future as well. All he had to do was keep his mouth shut and play along. And he would, under silent protest-unlike the general's other primary aide. H e remembered looki ng acr oss the room at his colleague, a small man who limped slightly. No on e knew why he limped. Nothing was wrong with his leg. H ere was the ultimate yes-man. H e knew what the secret car tels were up to an d he loved it, admired it, wanted to becom e a p art of it. And there was something more. This man, like the general and the other con trollers, feared the Nat ive Americans and wanted them removed not just because of the Nat ives' alienation from the expanding industrial economy that was poised to overrun their lands. They feared these people because of something deeper, some terrifying and transformative idea, known in its entirety only by a few of the elders, but which bubbled up throughout their culture and cal led out for the con trollers; to ch ange, to remember another vision of the future. Williams had found out that the missionary's daughter had arranged for the great medicine chiefs to com e together in one last attempt to ag ree on this knowledge, to find the words to share it-one last bid to explain themselves, to establish their value to a w orld quickly turning against them. Wi lliams had known, deep within, that the woman should have been heard, but in the end he had remained silent, and with one quick n od the general had pushed away the possibility of reconciliation and had ordered the battle to begin. As we watched, Williams' recollection shifted to a g orge in the deep wood s, site of the com ing battle. Caval ry poured ove r a ridge in a surprise offensive. The Nat ive Americans rose to the defense, attacki ng the caval ry from the bluffs on either side. A short distance away, a large man and a w oman huddled am ong the rocks . The man was a y oung acad emic, a con gressional aide, there only to ob serve, terrified he was this close to the battle. It was wrong, all wrong. H is interest was economics; he knew nothing of violence. H e had com e there con vinced that the white man and the Indian need not be in con flict, that the growing economic surge through the region might be adapted, evolved, integrated to include both cultures. Beside him in the rocks was the young woman seen at the military tent earlier. At this moment she felt abandoned, betrayed. H er effort cou ld have worked, she knew, if those with the power had listened to what was possible. Bu t she would not give up, she had told herself, not until the violence stopped. She kept saying, \"It can be healed! It can be healed.\" Suddenly on the downslope behind them, two caval rymen rode hard toward a single Nat ive. I strained to see who it was, finally recognizing the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"man as the angry chief I had seen in my mind when talking to David, the chief who had been so vocal against the white woman's ideas. As I watched, he turned quickly and shot an arrow into the chest of one of his pursuers. The other soldier leaped from his horse and fell upon the Native American. Both struggled furiously, the soldier's knife finally plunging deep into the throat of the darker man. Bl ood gushed acr oss the torn ground. Wat ching the events, the panicked economist pleaded with the woman to flee with him, but she motioned for him to stay' to be cal m. For the first time Williams cou ld see an old medicine man beside a tree next to them, his form flickering in and out of focus. At that instant another troop of caval ry crested the rise and was on top of them, firing indiscriminately. Bu llets tore through both the man and the woman. Wi th a smile the Indian defiantly stood and was likewise destroyed. At this point Williams' focus drifted to a h ill that ove rlooke d the entire scene. Another individual was looki ng down on the battle. H e was dressed in buckskins and led a p ack m ule, a m ountain man. H e turned from the battle and walked down the hill in the opposite direction, past the pool and falls, and then out of sight. I was astounded: the battle had taken place right here in the val ley, just south of the falls. When my attention returned to Wi lliams, he was reliving the horror of the blood shed and the hatred. H e knew his failure to act during the Native American wars had set up the con ditions and hopes of his most recent life, but just as before, he had failed to aw aken. H e had been together again with the con gressional aide who had been killed with the woman, and still he had failed to remember their mission. Wi lliams intended to m eet the younger man on a h illtop, am ong a ci rcle of large trees, and there his friend was supposed to aw aken and go on to find six others in the val ley, forming a g roup of seven. Together the group was to help resolve the Fear. The idea seemed to thrust him into a d eeper recollection. Fear had been the great enemy throughout humanity's long and tortuous history, and he seemed to kn ow that present human culture was polarizing, giving the con trollers in this historical time one last opportunity to seize power, to exploit the new technologies for their own purpose. He seemed to cr inge in agony. H e knew that it was tremendously important for the group of seven to com e together. H istory was poised for such groups, and only if enough of them formed, and only if enough of them understood the Fear, cou ld the polarization be dispelled and the experiments in the val ley ended. Very slowly I becam e aware that I was again in the place of soft, white light. Wi lliams' visions had ended, and both he and the other entities had quickly van ished. Afterward I had experienced a q uick m ovement backw ard that had left me dizzy and distracted. I noticed Wil beside me to the right. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"Where did he go?\" \"I'm not sure,\" he replied."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\"What was happening to him?\" \"He was experiencing a L ife Review.\" Inodded. \"Are you aware of what that is?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I know that people who have had near-death experiences often report that their whole lives flash before them. Is that what you mean?\" Wil looke d thoughtful. \"Yes, but the increased awareness of this review process is having great impact on human culture. It's another part of the higher perspective provided by a kn owledge of the Afterlife. Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, and as their stories are shared and talked about, the reality of the Life Review is becom ing part of our everyday understanding. We know that after death, we have to look at our lives again; and we're going to ag onize ove r every missed opportunity, ove r every cas e in which we failed to act . This knowledge is con tributing to ou r determination to pursue every intuitive image that com es to m ind, and keep it firmly in awareness. We 're living life in a m ore deliberate way. We don't want to m iss a single important event. We don't want the pain of looki ng back l ater and realizing that we blew it, that we failed to m ake the right decisions.\" Suddenly Wil paused, cocki ng his head as though hearing something. Immediately I felt another jolt in my solar plexus and heard the dissonant hum again. Mom ents later the sound faded. Wil was looki ng around. The solid white environment wa,-G shimmering with intennittent streaks of dull gray. \"Whatever is going on is affecting this dimension too!\" he, said. \"I don't know if we can maintain our vibration.\" As we waited, the dull streaks gradually diminished and the solid white backg round returned. \"Remember the warning about new technology in the Nintit Insight,\" Wil added, \"and Williams'com ment about those in Fear trying to con trol this technology.\" \"What about this group of seven com ing back?\" I asked. \"Arid those visions that Williams was having of this val ley in the nineteenth century? Wi l, I've seen them too. Wh at do you think the, visions mean?\" Wil's expression grew more serious. \"I think al l this is what we're supposed to be seeing. And I think you are part of the group.\" Suddenly the hum began to increase again. \"Williams said we first had to understand this Fear,\" Wi stressed, \"in order to help resolve it. That's what we have to do next; we have to find a w ay to understand this Fear.\" Wil had barely finished his thought when an ear-shattering sound tore"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"through my body, pushing me backw ard. Wi l reached out for me, his face distorted and out of focus. I tried to grab his arm, but he was suddenly gone, and I was falling downward, out of con trol, am id a panorama of col ors. OVERCOMING THE FEAR Shaking off the vertigo, I becam e aware that I was back at the falls. Across from me, under a rocky ove rhang, was my pack, lying exactly where I had placed it earlier. I looke d around: no sign of Wil. Wh at had happened? Wh ere did he go? Accor ding to m y watch, less than an hour had passed since Wil and I had entered the other dimension, and as I thought about the experience, I was struck w ith how much love and cal m I had felt, and how little anxiety-until now. Now everything around me seemed dull and muted. Wearily I walked ove r and picked up my pack, fear welling up in my stomach. Sensing too m uch exposure in the openness of the rocks , I decided to walk back i nto the hills to the south until I cou ld decide what to do. Wh en I had crested the first hill and started down the slope, I spotted a small man, perhaps fifty years old, walking up to m y left. H e had red hair and a thin goatee and wore hiking clothes. Be fore I cou ld hide, he spotted me and headed straight my way. When he reached me, he smiled cau tiously and said, \"I'm afraid I'm turned around a b it. Could you direct me back t o town?\" I gave him directions south to the spring and then on to the main stream, which he cou ld follow west to the rangers' station. He appeared relieved. \"I ran into someone east of here, earlier, who told me how to get back, but I must have made a w rong turn. Are you also heading toward town?\" Looki ng closely at the expression on his face, I seemed to pick u p a sadness and anger in his personality. \"I don't think so,\" I said. \"I'm looki ng for a friend who is out here somewhere. Wh at did the person you met look l ike?\" \"It was a w oman with blond hair and bright eyes,\" he replied. \"She talked rapidly I didn't cat ch her name. Wh o ar e you looki ng for?\" \"Charlene Billings. Is there anything else about the woman you saw that you can remember?\" \"She said something about the Nat ional Forest that made me think she might be one of those searcher types that hang out around here. Bu t I couldn't tell. She warned me to leave the val ley She told me she had to get her gear and then she was leaving also. S he seemed to think something was wrong out here, that everyone was in danger. She was actually very secretive. Frankly I didn't know what she was talking about.\" His tone suggested he was accu stomed to speaking with directness. As friendly as possible I said, \"It sounds as if the person you met"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"could have been my friend. Wh ere did you see her exactly?\" He pointed toward the south, and told me he had run into her about half a m ile back. S he had been walking alone and had headed southeast from there. \"I'll walk with you as far as the spring,\" I said. I picked up my pack, and as we walked down the hill, he asked, \"If that was your friend, where do you think she was going?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Into some mystical space, perhaps? Looki ng for utopia.\" He was smiling cynically. I realized he was baiting me. \"May be,\" I said. \"Don't you be- U l ieve in the possibility of utopia?\" \"No, of cou rse not. It's neolithic thinking. Nai ve.\" I glanced at him, fatigue beginning to ove rwhelm me, trying to end the conversation. \"Just a d ifference of opinion, I guess.\" He laughed. \"No, it's fact. There's no utopia com ing. Eve rything is getting worse out there, not better. Econ omically things are swinging out of con trol, and eventually it will explode.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"It's simple demographics. For most of this century there has been a large middle class in the We stern cou ntries, a cl ass who have promoted order and reason and car ried a g eneral faith that the economic system could work for everyone. \"But this faith is beginning to col lapse now. You can see it everywhere. Fewer people every day now believe in the system, or play by the rules. And it's all because the middle class is shrinking. Technological development is making labor val ueless and splitting human culture into two groups: the haves and the have-nots, those who have investments and ownership in the world economy and those who ar e restricted to m enial, service jobs. Couple this with the failure of education and you can see the scop e of the problem.\" \"That sounds awfully cynical,\" I said. \"It's realistic. I t's the truth. For most people it takes more and more effort just to survive out there. H ave you seen the surveys on stress? Tension is off the scale. Nob ody feels secure, and the worst hasn't even begun yet. Population is exploding, and as technology expands even more, the distance will grow between the educated and the uneducated, and the haves will con trol more and more of the global economy, while drugs and crime will con tinue to soar with the have-nots. \"And what do you think,\" he con tinued, \"will happen in the underdeveloped cou ntries? Already much of the Middle Eas t and A ca i s in the hands of religious fundamentalists whose aim is to destroy organized civilization, which they think is a satanic empire, and replace it with some kind of perverted theocracy, where religious leaders are in charge of everything and they have the sanctioned power to con demn to death those they con sider heretics, anywhere in the world."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"\"What kind of people would agree with this kind of butchery in the name of spirituality? Yet they are increasing every day. China still practices female infanticide, for example. Do you believe that? \"I'm telling you: law and order and respect for human life are on their way out. The world is degenerating into a m ob mentality, ruled by envy and revenge and led by shrewd charlatans, and it's probably too l ate to stop it. Bu t do you know what? Nob ody really car es. Nob ody! The politicians won't do an ything. All they car e about is their personal fiefdoms, and how to retain them. The world is changing too f ast. No on e can cat ch up, and that makes us just look ou t for number one and get whatever we can as fast as we can , before it's too l ate. This sentiment permeates the whole of civilization and every occu pational group.\" He took a b reath and looke d at me. I had stopped on the crest of one of the hills to vi ew the impending sunset, and our eyes met. H e seemed to realize he had gotten car ried away with his tirade, and in that moment he began to look d eeply familiar to m e. I told him my name and he responded with his, Joel Lipscom b. We looke d at each other for another long moment, but he offered no indication that he knew me. Wh y had we met in this val ley? As soon as I had formulated that last question in my mind, I knew the answer. H e was voi cing the vision of Fear that Williams had mentioned. A chill ran through me. This was supposed to happen. I looke d at him with a n ew seriousness. \"Do you really think things are that bad?\" \"Yes, absolutely,\" he replied. \"I'm a journalists and you can see this attitude playing out in our profession. In the past we at least attempted to do ou r job with certain standards of integrity. But no longer. It's all hype and sensationalism. No on e's looki ng for the truth anymore or trying to present it in the most accu rate way. journalists are looki ng for the scoop , the most outrageous perspective-every bit of dirt they can dig up. \"Even if particular accu sations have a logical explanation, they are reported anyway, for their impact on ratings and circulation. in a world where the people are numbed and distracted, the only thing that sells is the unbelievable. And the pity is that this kind of journalism is self-perpetuating. A young journalist looks at this situation and thinks that to survive in the business he has to play the game. If he doesn't, he thinks he'll be left behind, ruined, which is what leads to so-cal led investigative reports being intentionally faked. It happens all the time.\" We had proceeded south and were making our way down the rocky terrain. \"Other occu pational groups suffer from the same con dition,\" Joel went on. \"God, look at attorneys. Perhaps there was a time when being an officer of the cou rt meant something, when the participants in the process shared a com mon respect for the truth, for justice. Bu t no longer. Think ab out the recent celebrity trials"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"cove red by television. Lawyers now do everything they can to subvert justice, intentionally, trying to con vince jurors to believe the hypothetical when there is no evidence-hypotheticals that the attorneys know are lies-just to get someone off. And other attorneys com ment on the proceedings as though these tactics are com mon practice and absolutely justified under our system of law, which is not true. \"Under our system, everyone is entitled to a f air trial. Bu t the lawyers are beholden to ensure fairness and cor rectness, not to distort the truth and undermine justice simply to get their client off at all costs. Be cause of television, at least we've been able to see these corrupt practices for what they represent: simple expediency on the part of trial lawyers to enhance their reputations in or er to com mand higher fees. The reason they're so blatant is that they think no on e car es, and obviously no on e does. Eve ryone else is doing the same thing. \"We're cutting cor ners, maximizing short-term profits instead of planning long-term, because inside, con sciously or unconsciously, we don't think ou r success can last. And we're doing this even if we have to break t he spirit of trust we have with others and advance our own interests at the expense of someone else. \"Pretty soon all the subtle assumptions and agreements that hold civilization together will be totally subverted. Think what will happen once unemployment gets to a ce rtain level in the inner cities. Crime is out of con trol now. Police officers aren't going to ke ep risking their lives for a p ublic that doesn't notice anyway. Wh y find yourself on the stand twice a w eek getting grilled by some attorney who's not interested in the truth anyway, or worse, writhing in pain while your lifeblood runs out on the ground in some dark al ley somewhere, when no on e car es? Be tter to look t he other way and do your twenty years as quietly as f possible, maybe even take a few bribes on the side. And it goes on and on. Wh at's going to stop it?\" He paused and I glanced back at him as we walked. \"I guess you think some spiritual renaissance is going LO change all this?\" he asked. \"I sure hope so.\" He struggled ove r a fallen tree to cat ch up with me. \"Listen,\" he continued, \"I bought into this spirituality stuff for a w hile, this idea of purpose and destiny and Insights. I cou ld even see some interesting coincidences happening in my own life. Bu t I decided it was all crazy. The human mind can imagine all sorts of silly things; we don't even realize we're doing it. Wh en you get right down to it, all this talk of spirituality is just weird rhetoric.\" I started to cou nter his argument but changed my mind. My intuition was to hear him out first. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I guess it sometimes sounds that way.\" \"Take for instance the talk I've heard about this val ley,\" he went on. \"That's the kind of nonsense I used to listen to. T his is just a val ley full of trees and bushes like a thousand others.\" He put his hand on a large tree as we passed. \"You think this Nat ional Forest is going to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"survive? Forget it. Wi th the way humans are polluting the oce ans, and saturating the ecosystem with manmade car cinogenics, and con suming paper and other wood products, this place will becom e a g arbage bin, like everywhere else. In fact, no on e car es about trees now. H ow do you think the government gets away with building road s in here at taxpayer expense and then selling the timber at below-market val ue? O r swapping the best, most beautiful areas for ruined land somewhere else, just to m ake the developers happy? \"You probably think something mystical is happening here in this val ley. And why not? Eve ryone would love for there to be something mystical going on, especially con sidering the diminishing quality of life. Bu t the fact is, there's nothing esoteric happening. We 're just animals, creatures smart enough and unlucky enough to have figured out we're alive, and we're going to die without ever knowing any purpose. We can pretend all we want and we can wish all we want, but that basic existential fact remains-we can 't know.\" I looke d back at him again. \"Don't you believe in any kind of spirituality?\" He laughed. \"If a G od exists, he must be an exceedingly cruel monster of a G od. There cou ldn't be a spiritual reality operating here! How could there be? Look at the world. Wh at kind of God would design such a devastating place where children die horribly by earthquakes and senseless crimes and starvation, when restaurants toss out tons of food every day? \"Although,\" he added, \"perhaps that's the way it's supposed to be. Perhaps that's God's plan. May be the 'end times' scholars are cor rect. They think life and history are all just a test of faith to see who will win salvation and who won't, a d ivine plan to destroy civilization in order to separate the believers from the wicked.\" He attempted a smile, but it quickly faded as he drifted into his own thoughts. Finally he quickened his pace to walk up even with me. We were entering the sage meadow again, and I cou ld see the crow tree a q uarter of a m ile away. \"Do you know what these end-times people really believe is happening?\" he asked. \"I did a study of them several years ago; they're fascinating.\" \"Not really,\" I said, nodding for him to go on . \"They study the prophecies hidden in the Bible, especially in the book of Revelation. They believe that we live in what they cal l the last days, the time when all the prophecies will com e true. Essentially what they think is this: History is now set up for the return of the Christ and the creation of the heavenly kingdom on Ear th. But before this can occu r the Ear th has to suffer a series of wars, natural disasters, and other apocal yptic events predicted in the Scriptures. And they know every one of these predictions, so they spend their time watching world events very closely, waiting for the next event on the timetable.\" \"What's the next event?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"\"A peace treaty in the Middle Eas t that will allow the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. Sometime after that, accor ding to them, a m assive rapture will begin am ong true believers, whoever they are, and they will be snatched off the face of the Ear th and lifted into Heaven.\" I stopped and looke d at him. \"They think these people will begin to disappear?\" \"Yeah, that's in the Bible. Then com es the tribulation, which is a seven-year period when all hell breaks loose for whoever is left on Earth. Apparently everything is expected to fall apart: giant earthquakes destroy the economy; oce an levels destroy many cities; plus rioting and crime and the rest of it. And then a p olitician emerges, probably in Europe, who of fers a p lan to pull things back t ogether, if, of cou rse, he's set up with supreme power. This includes a ce ntralized electronic economy which coor dinates com merce in most parts of the world. To participate in this economy, however, and take advantage of the automation, one has to swear allegiance to this leader and have a ch ip implanted in one's hand, through which all economic interactions are documented. \"This Antichrist at first protects Israel and facilitates a p eace treaty, then attacks later, starting a w orld war that ultimately involves the Islamic nations, Russia, and finally China. A ccor ding to the prophecies, just as Israel is about to fall, the angels of God Swoop down and win the war, installing a spiritual utopia that lasts a thousand years.\" He cleared his throat and looke d at me. \"Wal k through a religious books tore sometime and look ar ound; there are com mentaries and novels about these prophecies everywhere, and more com ing out all the time.\" \"Do you think these end-times scholars are cor rect?\" He shook h is head, \"I don't think so. T he only prophecy that's being played out in this world is man's greed and cor ruption. Some dictator might rise up and take ove r, but it will be because he saw a w ay to take advantage of the chaos-\" \"Do you think this will happen?\" \"I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing. If the col lapse of the middle class con tinues, and the poor get poorer and the inner cities get more crime-infested and spread into the suburbs, and then on top of that we experience, say, a series of big natural disasters and the whole economy crashes for a w hile, we'll have bands of hungry marauders preying on the masses and total panic everywhere. In the face of this kind of violence, if someone com es along and proposes a w ay to save us, to straighten things out, asking only that we surrender some civil liberties, I have no doubt that we'll do it.\" We stopped and drank some water from my can teen. Fifty yards ahead was the crow tree. I perked up; far in the backg round I cou ld detect the faint dissonance of the hum. Joel's eyes squinted in con centration, watching me closely \"What are you hearing?\""},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"I turned around and faced him. \"It's a strange noise, a h um we ve been perceiving. I think it may be some kind of experiment going on in the valley.\" \"What kind of experiment? Wh o's con ducting it? Wh y can 't I hear it?\" I was about to tell him more when we were interrupted by another sound. We listened car efully. \"That's a ve hicle,\" I said. Two m ore gray Jeeps were approach ing from the west and heading toward us. We ran behind a p atch of tall briers and hid, and they passed within a h undred yards without stopping, heading southeast along the same path the earlier jeep had followed. \"I don't like this,\" Joel said. \"Who was that?\" \"Well, it's not the Forest Service, and no on e else is supposed to be driving in here. I think it must be the people involved with the experiment.\" He looke d horrified. \"If you want,\" I said, \"you can take a m ore direct route back t o town. just head southwest toward that ridge in the distance. You'll run into the stream after about three-quarters of a m ile and you can follow it west into town from there. I think you can arrive before it gets too d ark.\" \"You're not com ing?\" \"Not now. I'm going directly south to the stream and wait awhile for my friend.\" He tensed his forehead. \"These people cou ldn't be con ducting an experiment without someone in the Forest Service knowing about it.\" \"I know.\" \"You don't think you can do an ything about this, do you? This is something big.\" I didn't respond; a p ang of anxiety rushed through me. He listened for a m oment and then moved past me into the val ley, walking quickly. H e looke d back on ce and shook h is head. I watched him until he crossed the meadow and disappeared into the forest on the other side, then I hurriedly walked toward the south, thinking again of Charlene. Wh at had she been doing out here? Wh ere was she going? I had no an swers. Pushing hard, I reached the stream in about thirty minutes, The sun was now com pletely hidden by the band of clouds at the western horizon, and the twilight cas t the wood s in om inous gray tones. I was tired and dirty, and I knew that listening to Joel and seeing the Jeeps had affected my mood severely. Perhaps I had enough evidence now to go to the authorities; perhaps that was the way I cou ld help Charlene most. Several options danced through my head, all rationalizing my return to"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"town. Because the wood s on both sides of the stream were thin, I decided to wade acr oss and make my way into the thicker forest on the other side, although I knew that area was private property. Once acr oss, I stopped abruptly, hearing another jeep, then broke into a run. Fifty feet ahead the land rose quickly into a kn ob of boulders and outcroppings, twenty feet high. Climbing quickly, I reached the top and acce lerated my pace, then leaped upon a p ile of large rocks , intending to jump them quickly to the other side. Wh en my foot hit the topmost rock, the huge stone rolled forward, throwing my feet out from under me and starting the whole pile moving. I bounced once on my hip and landed in a small gully, the pile still tumbling my way. Several of the rocks , each two or three feet in diameter, were car eening down, com ing squarely for my chest. I had time to roll onto m y left side and raise my arms, but I knew I cou ldn't get out of the way. Then, out of the cor ner of my eye, I saw a w ispy white form moving in front of my body. Simultaneously an unusual knowing cam e ove r me that the huge rocks would somehow miss. I closed my eyes and heard them crash on both sides. Slowly I opened my eyes and peered out through the dust, wiping the dirt and rock ch ips from my face. The rocks were lying neatly beside me. How had that happened? Wh at was that white form? For a m oment I looke d around the scene, and then behind one of the rocks I saw a slight movement. A small bobcat cub eased around and looke d directly into m y eyes. I knew it was big enough to have run away, but it was lingering, looki ng at me. The rising sound of the approach ing vehicle finally sent the bobcat scam pering into the wood s. I jumped to m y feet and ran several more steps before landing awkwardly on another rock. A bolt of throbbing pain raced through my whole leg as my left foot gave way I fell to the ground and crawled the last two yards into the trees. I rolled around behind a h uge oak as the vehicle pulled up to the stream, slowed for a few minutes, then raced away, again toward the southeast. My heart pounding, I sat up and pulled off my boot to inspect the ankle. It was already beginning to swell. Wh y this? I thought. As I slid around to stretch out my leg, I observed a w oman staring at me from about thirty feet away. I froze as she walked toward me. \"Are you all right?\" she asked, her voi ce con cerned but wary. She was a tall black w oman, perhaps forty, dressed in loose fitting sweat clothes and tennis shoes. Strands of dark hair had pulled out of her ponytail and dangled in the breeze above her temples. In her hand was a small green knapsack. \"I was sitting ove r there and saw you fall,\" she said. \"I'm a d octor. Do you want me to take a look?\" \"I'd appreciate that,\" I said dizzily, not believing the coi ncidence."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"She knelt down beside me and moved the foot gently, at the same time surveying the area toward the creek. \" Are you out here alone?\" I told her briefly about looki ng for Charlene, but left out everything else. She said she had seen no on e of that description. As she talked, finally introducing herself as May a Ponder, I becam e con vinced that she was com pletely trustworthy. I told her my name and where I lived. When I finished, she said, \"I'm from Asheville, although I have a h ealth center, with a p artner, a few miles south of here. It's new. We also ow n forty acr es of the val ley right here that joins the Nat ional Forest.\" She pointed to the area where we were sitting. \"And another forty acr es up the ridge to the south.\" I unzipped a p ocke t on my hiking pack an d pulled out my can teen, \"Wou ld you like some water?\" I asked. \"No t hanks, I have some.\" She reached inside her own pack, retrieved a canteen, and opened the top. Bu t instead of drinking, she soake d a small towel and wrapped my foot, an act ion that made me grimace in pain. Turning and looki ng into m y eyes, she said, \"You've definitely sprained this ankle.\" \"How badly?\" I asked. She hesitated. \"What do you think?\" \"I don't know. Let me try to walk on it.\" I attempted to stand, but she stopped me. \"Wai t a m inute,\" she said. \"Before you try to walk, analyze your attitude. H ow badly do you think you're hurt?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that very often your recuperation time depends on what you think, not me.\" I looke d down at the ankle. \"I think it cou ld be pretty bad. If it is, I'll have to get back t o town somehow.\" \"What then?\" \"I don't know. If I can 't walk, I may have to go find someone else to look f or Charlene.\" \"Do you have any idea why this acci dent happened now?\" \"Not really. Wh y does that matter?\" \"Because, again, very often your attitude about why an acci dent or illness has happened has an effect on your recuperation.\" I looke d at her closely, well aware that I was resisting. Part of me felt as though I didn't have time for this discussion right now. It seemed too s elf-involved for the situation. Although the hum had ceased, I had to as sume that the experiment was con tinuing."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Everything felt too d angerous and it was almost dark . . . an d Charlene cou ld be in terrible trouble for all I knew. I was also aw are of a d eep sense of guilt toward May a. Wh y would I feel guilty? I tried to shake off the emotion. \"What kind of doctor are you?\" I asked, sipping some water. She smiled, and for the first time I saw her energy lift. She had decided to trust me too. \"Permit me to tell you about the kind of medicine I practice,\" she said. \"Medicine is changing, and changing rapidly. We don't think of the body as a m achine anymore, with parts that eventually wear out and have to be fixed or replaced. We 're beginning to understand that the health of the body is determined to a g reat degree by our mental processes: what we think of life and especially of ourselves, at both the con scious and the unconscious levels. \"This represents a fundamental shift. Un der the old method the doctor was the expert and healer, and the patient the passive recipient, hoping the doctor would have all the answers. Bu t we know now that the inner attitude of the patient is crucial. A key factor is fear and stress and the way we handle it. Sometimes the fear is con scious, but very often we repress it entirely. \"This is the brave, macho at titude: deny the problem, push it away, conjure up our heroic ag enda. I f we take this attitude, then the fear continues to eat at us unconsciously. Adopting a p ositive outlook i s very important in staying healthy, but we have to engage in this attitude in full awareness, using love, not macho, for this attitude to be com pletely effective. Wh at I believe is that our unspoke n fears create blocks or crimps in the body's energy flow, and it's these blocks that ultimately result in problems. The fears keep manifesting in ever-greater degrees until we deal with them. Physical problems are the last step. Ideally these blocks would be dealt with early, in a p reventive way, before illness develops.\" \"So you think al l illness can ultimately be prevented or cured?\" \"Yes, I'm sure we will have longer or shorter life spans; that's probably up to the Creator, but we don't have to be sick, and we don't have to be the victim of so m any acci dents.\" \"So you think this applies to an acci dent, like my sprain, as well as to illnesses?\" She smiled. \"Yes, in many cas es.\" I was con fused. \"Look, I don't have time for this right now. I'm really worried about my friend. I've got to do something!\" \"I know, but I have a h unch this con versation won't take r long.

She nodded. \"What exactly do you suggest I do?\" \"Well, the technique I've had great success with is this: first, we try to remember the nature of your thoughts just prior to the health problem-in your cas e, the sprain. Wh at were you thinking? Wh at is the fear this problem is revealing to you?\" I thought for a m oment, then said, \"I felt afraid, am bivalent. The situation here in this val ley seemed much more sinister than I thought. I didn't feel as though I cou ld handle it. O n the other hand, I knew Charlene might need help. I was con fused and torn ove r what to do.\" \"So you sprained your ankle?\" I leaned toward her. \"Are you saying that I sabotaged myself so I wouldn't have to take act ion? Isn't that too s imple?\" \"That's for you to say, not me. Bu t very often it is simple. Besides, the most important thing is not to spend time defending or proving. Just play with it. Try to remember everything you can about where the health problem cam e from. Ex plore for yourself.\" \"How do I do that?\" \"You have to cal m your mind and receive this information.\" \"Intuitively?\" \"Intuitively, prayerfully, however you con ceive the process.\" I resisted again, not sure whether I cou ld relax and clear my mind. Finally I closed my eyes, and for a m oment my thoughts ceased, but then a succession of memories of Wil and the day's events intruded. I let them go by and cleared my mind again. immediately I saw a scene of myself at age ten, limping away from a touch football game, well aware that I was faking the injury. That's right! I thought. I used to fake sprains to avoi d having to perform under pressure. I had forgotten all about this! I realized that later I began to act ually hurt the ankle frequently, in all kinds of situations. As I pondered the memory, another flash of recollection entered my mind, a cl oudy scene of myself in another time, feeling cocky , con fident, impulsive, then as I worked in a d ark, candlelit room , the door crashed in and I was dragged away in terror. I opened my eyes and looke d at May a. \" May be I have something.\" I shared the con tent of my childhood memory, but the other vision felt too vag ue to be described, so I didn't mention it. Afterward, May a as ked, \"What do you think?\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"\"I don't know; the sprain seemed the result of pure chance. It's hard to imagine that the acci dent cam e from this need to avoi d the situation. Be sides, I've been in worse situations than this many times and I didn't sprain an ankle. Wh y did it happen now?\" She looke d thoughtful. \"Who kn ows? Perhaps now is the time to see through the habit. Accidents, illness, healing, they're all more mysterious than any of us ever imagined. I believe that e have an undiscove red ability to influence what happens to us w in the future, including whether we are healthy-although, again, the power has to remain with the individual patient. \"There was a reason that I didn't offer an opinion con cerning how badly you were hurt. We in the medical establishment have learned that medical opinions have to be offered very car efully. Over the years the public has developed almost a w orship of doctors, and when a p hysician says something, patients have tended to take these opinions totally to heart. The cou ntry doctors of a h undred years ago kn ew this, and would use this prindple to act ually paint an overly optimistic picture of any health situation. If the doctor said that the patient would get better, very often the patient would internalize this idea in his or her mind and act ually defy all odds to recove r. In later years, however, ethical con siderations have prevented such distortions, and the establishment has felt that the patient is entitled to a col d scientific as sessment of his or her situation. \"Unfortunately when this was given, sometimes patients dropped dead right before our eyes, just because they were told their con dition was terminal. We know now that we have to be very car eful with these assessments, because of the power of our minds. We want to focus this power in a p ositive direction. The body is cap able of miraculous regeneration. Bod y parts thought of in the past as solid forms are actually energy systems that can transform ove rnight. H ave you read the latest research on prayer? The simple fact that this kind of spiritual visualization is being scientifically proven to work totally undermines our old physical model of healing. We 're having to work ou t a n ew model.\" She paused and poured more water on the towel around my ankle, then continued, \"I believe the first step in the process is to identify the fear with which the medical problem seems to be con nected; this opens up the energy block i n your body to con scious healing. The next step is to pull in as much energy as possible and focus it at the exact locat ion of the block.\" I was about to as k how this was done, but she stopped me. \"Go ah ead and raise your energy level as much as you can .\" Accepting her guidance, I began to ob serve the beauty around me and to concentrate on a spiritual con nection within, evoki ng a h eightened sensation of love. G radually the col ors becam e more vivid and everything in my awareness increased in presence. I could tell that she was raising her own energy at the same time."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"When I felt as though my vibration had increased as much as possible, I looke d at her. She smiled back at me. \"Okay, now you can focus the energy on the block.\" \"How do I do that?\" I asked. \"You use the pain. That's why it's there, to help you focus.\" \"What? Isn't the idea to get rid of pain?\" \"Unfortunately that's what we've always thought, but pain is really a beacon .\" \"A beacon ?\" \"Yes,\" she said, pressing several locat ions on my foot. \"How badly does it hurt right now?\" \"It's a throbbing ach e, but not too b ad.\" She unwrapped the towel. \"Focus your attention on the pain and try to feel it as much as possible. Determine its exact locat ion.\" \"I know where it is. It's in the ankle.\" \"Yes, but the ankle is a large area. Wh ere exactly?\" I studied the throbbing. She was cor rect. I had been generalizing the pain to the whole ankle. Bu t as my leg was stretched out with the toes of my foot pointed upward, the pain was more precisely centered in the top left portion of this joint and about an inch inward. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I've got that.\" \"Now place all your attention on that specific ar ea. Be there with all of your being.\" For a few minutes I said nothing. Wi th total con centration I felt this locat ion in my ankle com pletely. I noticed that all the other perceptions of my body-breathing, the locat ion of my hands and arms, sticky sweat on the back of my neck-f aded far into the backg round. \"Feel the pain totally,\" she reminded. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'm there.\" \"What's happening with the pain?\" she asked. \"I still feel it, but it has changed in character or something. It's becom ing warmer, less bothersome, more like a tingling.\" As I talked, the pain began to take on its normal sensation again. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"I believe that pain serves another function beyond just telling us that something is wrong. Perhaps it also points out exactly where the difficulty is, so that we can follow it into ou r bodies like a b eacon"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"and place our attention and energy in exactly the right spot. It's almost as if both the pain and our con centrated attention can 't occu py the same space. O f cou rse, in cas es of severe pain, where con centration is impossible, we can use anesthetics to ease the intensity, although I think it's best to leave some pain so that the beacon effect can be utilized.\" It She paused and looke d at me. \"What's next?\" I asked. \"Next,\" she replied, \"is to con sciously send higher divine energy into the exact spot identified by the pain, intending that the love will transform the cells there into a s tate of perfect functioning.\" I just stared. \"Go ah ead,\" she said. \"Get com pletely con nected again. I'll guide you through it.\" I nodded when I was ready. \"Feel the pain with all your being,\" she began, \"and now image your love energy going right into the heart of the pain, lifting that exact point of your body, the atoms themselves, into a h igher vibration. See the particles take a q uantum jump into the pure energy pattern that is their optimum state. Literally feel a tingling sensation in that spot as the vibration acce lerates.\" After pausing for a full minute, she con tinued. \"Now , without changing your focus on the point of the pain, begin to feel your energy, the tingle, moving up both legs . . . t hrough your hips rl into your abdomen and chest ... an d finally into your neck an d head. Feel your whole body tingling with the higher vibration. See every organ operating at optimal efficiency.\" I followed her instructions exactly, and after a few moments my whole body felt lighter, more energized. I held that state for about ten minutes, then opened my eyes and looke d at May a. Using a flashlight in the darkness, May a was putting up my tent on a flat area between two pines. G lancing ove r at me, she s aid, \"Feel better?\" I nodded. \"Do you understand the process so far?\" \"I think so. I sent energy into the pain.\" \"Yes, but what we did earlier was just as important. You begin by looki ng at the meaning of the injury or illness, what its occu rrence is pointing out about some fear in your life that is holding you back, manifesting in your body. This is what opens the fear block s o that the visualization can penetrate. \"After the block i s open, then you can use pain as a b eacon , raising the vibration in that area an d then in your entire body."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"But finding the origin of the fear is vitally important. Wh en the origin of the illness or acci dent is very deep, it often requires hypnosis or intensive cou nseling.\" I told her about the medieval image I had seen of the door being kicked in and of myself being dragged away. She looke d thoughtful. \"Sometimes the root of the block g oes back a very long way. Bu t as you explore it further, and begin to work through the fear that is holding you back, you will usually discove r a fuller understanding of who you are, of what your current life on Ear th is all about. And this sets the stage for the last-and, I firmly believe, the most important-step in the healing process. Mos t important of all is to look d eeply enough to remember what you want to do with your life. Real healing takes place when we can envision a n ew kind of future for ourselves that excites us. Inspiration is what keeps us well. People aren't healed to watch more TV.\" I looke d at her for a m oment, then said, \"You mentioned that prayer works. H ow is the best way to pray for someone who is not well?\" \"We're still trying to figure that out. It has something to do with the Eighth Insight process of sending the energy and love that flow through us from the divine source to the person, and at the same time visualizing that the individual will remember what they really want to do with their life. O f cou rse, sometimes what the person remembers is that it's time to m ake a transition into the other dimension. Wh en that's the cas e, we have to acce pt it.\" May a was finishing with the tent and added, \"Also ke ep in mind that the procedures I've recom mended should be done in con junction with the very best in traditional medicine. If we were near my clinic, I would take you in for a full examination, but in this cas e, unless you disagree, I suggest you stay here tonight. It's better if you don't move much.\" As I watched, she set up my stove, turned it on, and placed a boiler con taining freeze-dried soup on the flame. \"I'm going back i nto town. I need to get a splint for your ankle and some other supplies, just in cas e we need them, then I'll hike back ou t and check on you. I'll bring a radio too, in cas e we have to send for help.\" I nodded. She poured her can teen's water into m ine and looke d ove r at me. Be hind her, the last streak of light was van ishing toward the west. \"Did you say your clinic was near here?\" I asked. \"Actually it's only about four miles to the south,\" she said, \"over the ridge, but there's no way to com e into the val ley from that direction. The only pass is the main road that com es in south of town.\" \"How did you happen to be here?\" She smiled and looke d slightly embarrassed. \"It's funny. I had a d ream last night about hiking into the val ley again, and this morning I decided I would do just that. I've been working hard and I guess I needed some time to reflect on what I'm doing at the clinic. My partner and I have a g reat deal of experience with alternative approach es, Chinese medicine, herbs, yet at the same time, we have the resources of the world's best in traditional medicine at our fingertips through"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"com puter. I'd dreamed about this kind of clinic for years.\" She paused for a m oment, then said, \"Before you showed up I was sitting right ove r there, and my energy just shot through the roof. It seemed as though I cou ld see the whole story of my life, every experience I've had, from my early childhood all the way up until this moment, stretched out before me in plain view. It was the clearest Sixth Insight experience I've ever had. \"All those events were a p reparation,\" she con tinued. \"I grew up in a family where my mother struggled with chronic disease all her life, but would never participate in her own healing. At the time, the doctors knew no better, but throughout my childhood , her refusal to explore her own fears irritated me, and I noticed every bit of new information about diet, vitamins, stress levels, meditation, and their role in health, trying to con vince her to becom e involved. During my adolescence I was torn between joining the clergy and becom ing a d octor. I don't know; it was as if I was driven to figure out how we use insight, faith, to ch ange the future, to heal. \"And my father,\" she con tinued. \"He was something else. H e worked in the biological sciences, but he never would explain any of his results except in his acad emic papers. 'Pure research,' he cal led it. H is associates treated him like a g od. H e was unapproach able, the ultimate authority. I was grown, and he had died of can cer, before I understood his real interest-the immune system, and specifically how com mitment and excitement with life enhance the immune system. \"He was the first one to see this relationship, and that's what all the current research shows now. Yet I never got to talk with him about it. At first I wondered why I would be born to a f ather who behaved like that. Bu t I finally acce pted the fact that my parents had the exact com bination of traits and interests to inspire my own evolution. That's why I wanted to be with them in my early life. Looki ng at my mother, I knew that each of us must take responsibility for our own healing. We can't just turn it ove r to ot hers. H ealing in its essence is about breaking through the fears associated with life-fears that we don't want to face-and finding our own special inspiration, a vi sion of the future, that we know we're here to help create. \"From my father, I saw clearly that medicine must be more responsive, must ackn owledge the intuition and vision of the people we treat. We have to com e down from our ivory tower. The com bination of the two set me up to look f or a n ew paradigm in medicine: on e based on the patient's ability to take con rol of his or her life and to get back on the right path. That's my message, I guess, the idea that inwardly we know how to participate in our own healing, physically and emotionally. We can becom e inspired to shape a h igher, more ideal future, and when we do, miracles happen.\" Standing up, she glanced at my ankle, then at me. \"I'm leaving now,\" she said. \"Try not to put any weight on your foot. Wh at you need is com plete rest. I'll be back i n the morning.\" I think I must have looke d anxious, because she knelt down again and put both hands on the ankle. \"Don't worry,\" she said. \"With enough energy there's nothing that can 't be healedhatred ... w ar."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"It's just a m atter of com ing together with the right vision.\" She patted my foot gently. \"We can heal this! We can heal this!\" She smiled once, then turned and walked away. I suddenly wanted to cal l out and tell her everything I had experienced in the other dimension and what I knew about the Fear and about the group com ing back, but instead I remained quiet, fatigue ove rwhelming me, con tent to watch her disappear into the trees. Tomorrow would be soon enough, I thought ... k because I knew exactly who she was. REMEMBER ING The next morning I jerked awake, the shrill cry of a h awk, high overhead, pulling me into aw areness. For a few moments I listened carefully, imagining her lofty rolls. She cried one more time then stopped. I sat up quickly and looke d through the tent flap; the day was cloudy but warm, and a light breeze swayed the treetops. Taking an Ace bandage from my pack, I car efully wrapped the ankle, working the joint car efully and feeling very little pain, then crawled out of the tent and stood up. After a few moments I put weight on my foot and took a t entative step. The ankle felt weak, but if I limped slightly, it seemed to support me. I wondered: had May a's procedure helped, or had the ankle not been hurt that badly? There was no way to know. Digging into m y pack ag ain, I retrieved a ch ange of clothes, then grabbed the dirty dishes from the night before. Cautiously, alert for any odd sound or movement, I made my way back t o the stream. Wh en I locat ed a p lace where I was shielded from view, I slipped off my clothes and entered the water, finding it col d and refreshing. I lay there without thinking, trying to forget the anxiety rising in my gut, gazing out at the col ors of the leaves above my head. Suddenly I began to recall a d ream from the night before. I was sitting on a rock ... s omething was happening ... Wi l was there ... an d others. I vag uely remembered a field of blue and am ber. I struggled a moment longer but cou ld recall nothing more. As I opened a b ottle of soap , I noticed that the trees and bushes around me were am plified in appearance. Somehow the act of remembering my dream had increased my energy. Feeling lighter, I hastily bathed and washed off the dishes, noticing as I finished that a large rock t o m y right looke d very similar to the one on which I was sitting in my dream. I stopped and inspected the boulder more closely. Flat and about ten feet in diameter, its shape and col or matched exactly. In a few minutes I had taken down the tent, packe d, and hidden my gear under some fallen limbs. Then, returning to the rock, I sat down and tried to recall the blue field and the exact position Wil had occu pied in the dream. H e had been to m y left and slightly behind me. At that moment a cl ear image of his face cam e to m y mind, as in a cl ose-up photo. S truggling to m aintain the exact detail, I re-created his image and surrounded it with the blue field. Seconds later I felt a p ulling sensation in my solar plexus, and then I was again streaking through the col ors. Wh en I stopped, the environment"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"was pale blue and luminous, and Wil was beside me. \"Thank God you're back! \" he said, moving in closer. \"You becam e so dense I cou ldn't find you.\" \"What happened before?\" I asked. \"Why did the hum get so loud?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Where are we now?\" \"It's a p articular level where dreams seem to take place.\" I looke d out into the blue. Not hing was moving. \"You've been here?\" \"Yes, I cam e here before I found you at the falls, although at the time I didn't know why.\" For a m oment we both surveyed the environment again, then Wil asked, \"What happened to you when you went back?\" With excitement I began to describe everything that had occu rred, focusing first on Joel's forecast of environmental and civil col lapse. Wil listened intently, digesting every aspect of Joel's outlook. \"He was voi cing the Fear,\" Wil com mented. I nodded. \"That's what I think. D o you suppose all of what he said is really occu rring?\" I asked. \"I think the danger is that a lot of people are beginning to believe it's happening. Remember what the Ninth Insight said: as the spiritual renaissance progresses, it must ove rcom e a p olarization of Fear.\" I cau ght Wil's eye. \"I met someone else, a w oman.\" Wil listened as I described my experience with May a, particularly the injury to m y ankle and her healing procedures. When I finished, he gazed into the distance, thinking. \"I think May a is the woman in Williams' vision,\" I added. \"The woman who was trying to stop the war with the Nat ive Americans.\" \"Perhaps her idea of healing holds the key to dealing with the Fear,\" Wil replied. I nodded for him to con tinue. \"This all makes sense,\" he said. \"Look at what has already occu rred. You cam e here searching for Charlene and met David, who said the Tenth was a g reater understanding of the spiritual renaissance happening on this planet, an understanding attained by grasping our relationship to the Afterlife dimension. H e said the Insight has something to do with clarifying the nature of intuitions, of maintaining them in our minds, of seeing our synchronistic path in a fuller way. \"Later, you figured out how to m aintain your intuitions in this way and found me at the falls, and I con firmed that maintaining the intuitions, the mental images of ourselves, was the operative mode in the Afterlife as well, and that humans are moving into al ignment with this other"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"dimension. Soon after, we found ourselves watching Williams' Life Review, watching him agonize ove r not remembering something he had wanted to do, which was to com e together with a g roup of people to help deal with this Fear that threatens our spiritual awakening. \"He says we have to understand this Fear in order to do something about it, and then we get separated and you run into a j ournalist, Joel, who takes a long time to enunciate what? A fearful vision of the future. In fact, a fear of the com plete destruction of civilization. \"Then, of cou rse, you next run into a w oman whose life is all about healing, and the way she facilitates healing is to help people work through fear blocks by prodding their memory, helping them to discern why they're on the planet. This remembering has to be the key.\" A sudden movement drew our attention. Another group of souls seemed to be forming about a h undred feet away \"They are probably here to help someone with their dreaming,\" Wil said. I looke d hard at him. \"They help us dream?\" \"Yes, in a w ay. Some other souls were here when you dreamed last night.\" \"How did you know about my dream?\" \"When you were jolted back i nto the physical, I tried to find you but I couldn't. Then, when I waited, I began to see your face, and moved here. The last time I cam e to this place, I cou ldn't quite grasp what was occu rring, but now I think I understand what happens when we dream.\" I shook m y head, not com prehending. He gestured out toward the souls. \"It apparently all happens synchronistically. These beings you see probably found themselves here just as I did earlier, by coi ncidence, and now they're probably waiting to see who com es by in their dream body.\" The backg round hum grew louder and I cou ldn't respond. I felt con fused, dizzy. Wi l cam e closer to m e, touching my back ag ain. \"Stay with me!\" he said. \"There's some reason we need to a s ee this.\" I struggled to cl ear my head, then noticed another form manifesting in the space beside the souls. At first I thought other souls were appearing, but then I realized the formation was much larger than anything I'd seen before: a w hole scene was being projected in front of us, like a h ologram, com plete with characters, setting, and dialogue. A single individual seemed to be at the center of the act ion, a m an vaguely familiar. After a m oment of con centration I realized that the person before us was Joel. As we watched, the scene began to unfold, like the plot of a m ovie. I strained to follow along, but my head was still foggy; I cou ldn't quite understand what was happening. As the episode progressed and the dialogue becam e more intense, both the souls and the journalist moved closer together. After several minutes the drama seemed to end, and everyone disappeared. \"What was happening?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"\"The individual in the center of the scene was dreaming,\" Wil said. \"That was Joel, the man I told you about,\" I replied. Wil turned to m e in astonishment. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you understand the dream he just had?\" \"No, I cou ldn't quite get it. Wh at happened?\" \"The dream was about a w ar of some kind. H e was fleeing a b omb-ravag ed city with shells exploding all around him, running for his life, thinking of nothing but safety and survival. Wh en he successfully evaded the horror and climbed a m ountain to look b ack at the city, he remembered that his orders had been to m eet another group of soldiers and supply a secret part to a n ew device that would make the enemy weapons inactive. To his horror he now realized that because he had failed to show up, the soldiers and the city were being systematically destroyed before his eyes.\" \"A nightmare,\" I com mented. \"Yes, but it has meaning. Wh en we dream, we unconsciously travel back to this sleep level, and other souls com e and help us. Don't forget what dreams do: t hey clarify how to handle current situations in our lives. The Seventh Insight says to interpret dreams by superimposing the plot of the dream against the real situation facing us in life.\" I turned and looke d at Wil. \"But what role do the souls play?\" As soon as I had asked that question, we began to m ove again. Wi l kept his hand against my back. Wh en we stopped, the light was shifting to a rich green, but I cou ld observe beautiful waves of am ber circulating around us. Wh en I focused intently, the amber streaks becam e individual souls. I glanced at Wil, who was smiling broad ly. This locat ion seemed to carry an increased mood of celebration and joy. As I watched the souls, several moved directly in front of us and closed together into a g roup. Their faces were broad and smiling, although still hard to focus on for any length of time. \"They're so full of love,\" I said. \"See if you can pick u p on their knowledge,\" Wil advised. When I focused on them with this intent, I realized that these souls were associated with May a. I n fact, they were ecstatic ab out her recent self-revelations, especially her understanding of the life preparation her mother and father had provided. They seemed to kn ow that May a had experienced a full Sixth Insight review and was on the verge of remembering why she had been born. I turned to face Wil, who ackn owledged that he, too, was seeing the images. At this moment I cou ld hear the hum again; my stomach tensed. Wi l held"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"my shoulders and back t ightly. Wh en the sound had ceased, my vibration fell dramatically, and I looke d out at the group of souls, attempting to open up and con nect with their energy in an attempt to boost my own. To my am azement they suddenly shifted out of focus and moved away from me to a n ew position twice as far away. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"You tried to con nect with them to increase your energy,\" Wil replied, \"instead of going within and con necting directly to God's energy inside. I did this myself once. These souls won't allow you to m istake them for the divine source. They know such an identification would not help your growth.\" I con centrated within and my energy returned. \"How do we get them back?\" I asked. As soon as I spoke , they returned to their original position. Wil and I glanced at each other, then he began to stare intensely at the group, a look of surprise on his face. \"What are you seeing?\" I asked. He nodded toward them without breaking his gaze, and I focused on the soul group as well, trying to pick u p on their knowledge again. After several moments I began to see May a. S he was immersed in the green environment. H er features seemed slightly different and were glowing brightly, but I was absolutely certain it was her. As I focused on her face, a h olographic image appeared in front of us-an image of May a ag ain in the time of the nineteenth-century war, standing in a log cab in with several other people, excited about stopping the con flict. She seemed to sense that accom plishing such a feat was just a m atter of remembering how to at tain the energy. It cou ld be done only if the right people cam e together with a com mon intention, she thought. Mos t attentive was a y oung man who was richly dressed. I recognized him to be the large man who was later killed with her. Racing forward, the vision moved to her failed attempt to speak w ith the army leaders and then to the wilderness, where she and the young man were killed. As we watched, she awakened after her death in the Afterlife and reviewed her lifetime, appalled at how single-mindedly, even naively, she had pursued her goal of stopping the war. She knew many of the others had been cor rect: the time wasn't right. We had not remembered enough of the Afterlife knowledge to accom plish such a feat. Not yet. After the review, we saw her move into the green environment, surrounded by the same group of souls that was in front of us now. Amazingly there seemed to be a com mon cor e expression in the faces throughout the group. At a ce rtain level, beneath their features, the souls all resembled May a. I glanced questioningly at Wil. \"This is May a's soul group,\" he said. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"It's a g roup of souls with whom she resonates closely,\" he said with excitement. \"This makes perfect sense. O ne of the journeys I took,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"before I found you, was to an other group who, in a w ay, looke d like you. I think it was your soul group.\" Before I cou ld say anything, there was movement in the sou group in front of us. Again, an image of May a was emerging. Still surrounded by her group in the green environment, she seemed to be standing quietly in front of an intense white light, similar to the one we had seen at Williams' Life Review. She was aware that something very profound was happening. H er ability to m ove around in the Afterlife had diminished, and her attention was shifting toward Ear th again. She cou ld see her prospective mother, newly married, sitting on a p orch, wondering if her health would hold up well enough to have a ch ild. May a was beginning to realize the great progress that cou ld be ach ieved if she were to be born to this mother. The woman had deep fears about her own health and so would generate an awareness of health issues very quickly in the mind of a ch ild. it would be the perfect place to develop an interest in medicine and healing, and it wouldn't be a knowledge con templated on merely intellectual terms, where the ego com es up with some fancy theory and never tests it against the challenges of real life, not if she was growing up with the psychology of this woman. May a kn ew that she herself had the tendency to be unrealistic an d fanciful, and she had already paid dearly for such brashness. That wouldn't happen again, not with the unconscious memory of what had occu rred in the nineteenth century reminding her to be very cau tious. No, she would go slow, be more isolated, and the environment established by this woman would be perfect. Wil cau ght my eye. \"We're seeing what occu rred when she began to contemplate her current life,\" he said. May a now envisioned how her relationship with her mother cou ld unfold. She would grow up exposed to her mother's negativity, her fears, her tendency to blame the doctors, which would inspire her interest in the mind/body con nection and the patient's responsibility in healing, and she would bring this information back t o her mother, who cou ld then becom e involved in her own recove ry. H er mother would becom e her first patient, and then a ke y supporter, a p rime example of the benefits of the new medicine. May a's focus moved to the prospective father, sitting next to the woman on the swing. O ccas ionally the woman would ask a q uestion and he would utter a on e-line answer. Mai nly he wanted just to sit and con template, not to talk. H is mind was virtually exploding with research possibilities and exotic biological questions he knew had never been posed before-most particularly the relationship between inspiration and the immune system. May a saw the advantages of this aloofness. Wi th him, she would be able to work through her own tendency to delude herself; she would have to think for herself and becom e realistic, right from the beginning. Eventually she and her father would be able to com municate on a scientific basis, and he would open up and provide her with a rich technical backg round with which to ground her new methods. She saw clearly that her birth to these parents cou ld be equally advantageous for them. At the same time her parents were stimulating an early interest in healing, she would be stretching them in a d estined direction as well: the mother toward an acce ptance of her personal role in avoi ding illness, the father toward ove rcom ing his"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"tendency to hide from others and to live only in his head. As we watched, her vision proceeded past her anticipated birth and into what might happen in childhood . She saw a m ultitude of specific people arriving in her life at just the right moment to stimulate learning and experience. In medical school, just the right patients and doctors would cross her path to stimulate an alternative orientation in her practice. Her vision moved to the meeting of her clinic partner and the establishment of a n ew model of healing. And then her vision revealed something else: she would be involved in a m ore global awakening. Be fore us, we saw her discove ry of the insights and then her reunion with a particular group, one of many independent groups that would begin to gravitate together all ove r the world. These groups would remember who they were at a h igher level and be instrumental in ove rcom ing the polarization of Fear. She suddenly saw herself engaged in important con versations with one particular man. H e was large, athletic, cap able, and dressed in army fatigues. To m y am azement I realized that she knew he was the man with whom she had been killed during the nineteenth century. I focused on him intently and received another shock. T his was the same man I had seen in Williams' Life Review, the work col league he had failed to help awaken. With this, her vision seemed to am plify to a l evel beyond my ability to com prehend, her body uniting with the blinding light behind it. All I could receive was that her personal vision of what she might accom plish with this birth was being enveloped within a larger vision that encom passed the whole history and future of humankind. She seemed to see her possible lifetime in ultimate perspective, situated clearly within the full expanse of where humanity had been and where it was going. I cou ld sense all this but cou ld not quite see the images themselves. Finally May a's vision seemed to be ove r, and we cou ld see her again in the green environment, still surrounded by her group. Now they were watching a scene on Ear th. Apparently her prospective parents had indeed decided to con ceive a ch ild and were com ing together in the very act of love that would ensure her con ception. May a's soul group had intensified in energy and now appeared as a large whitish swirl of moving am ber, drawing its intensity from the bright light in the backg round. I cou ld sense the energy myself as a d eeply felt, almost orgasmic level of love and vibration. Down below, the couple embraced, and at the moment of orgasm, a w hitish-green energy seemed to flow from the light, passing through May a an d her soul group, and enter into the cou ple. Wi th an orgasmic rush, the energy cam e through their bodies toward each other, pushing the sperm and egg toward their fated union. As we watched, we cou ld see the moment of con ception and the miraculous joining of the two ce lls into on e. Slowly at first, and then more rapidly, the cells began to divide and differentiate, finally forming the shape of a h uman being. Wh en I looke d at May a, I realized that with every cell division, she becam e more hazy and out of focus. Finally, as the fetus matured, she disappeared from view com pletely. H er soul group remained. Mor e knowledge seemed to be avai lable on what we had just witnessed, but"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"I lost con centration and missed it. Then suddenly the soul group itself was gone and Wil and I were left staring at each other. H e seemed terribly excited. \"What were we watching?\" I asked. \"it was the whole process of May a's birth into her current lifetime,\" Wil replied, \"held in the memory of her soul group. We got to see it all: her awareness of prospective parents, what she felt might be accom plished, and then the act ual way she was drawn into the physical dimension at con ception.\" I nodded for Wil to con tinue. \"The act of lovemaking itself opens up a p ortal from the Afterlife into the Ear thly dimension. The soul groups seem to exist in a state of extreme love even beyond what you and I can expen ence, extreme to the point that it feels orgasmic in nature. Sexual culmination creates an opening into the Afterlife, and what we experience as orgasm is just a glimpse of the Afterlife level of love and vibration as the portal is opened and the energy rushes through, potentially bringing in a n ew soul. We watched that happen. Sexual union is a h oly moment in which a part of Heaven flows into the Ear th.\" I nodded, thinking about the implications of what we had seen, then said, \"May a seemed to kn ow how her life cou ld turn out if she was born to these particular parents.\" \"Yes, apparently, before we are born, each of us experiences a vi sion of what our life can be, com plete with reflections on our parents and on our tendencies to engage in particular con trol dramas, even how we might work through these dramas with these parents and go on to be prepared for what we want to accom plish.\" \"I saw most of that,\" I said, \"but it seemed strange. Bas ed on what she told me about her real life, her pre-life vision was more ideal than what really happened-for instance, her relationship to her family. It didn't exactly turn out the way she wanted. H er mother never understood May a, or faced her own illness, and her J father was so al oof she never knew what he was researching until after his death.\" \"But that makes sense,\" Wil said. \"The vision apparently is an ideal guide for what our highest self intends to happen in life, the best-cas e scenario, so to speak, if all of us were following our intuitions perfectly. Wh at act ually occu rs is an approximation of this vision, the best everyone can do under the act ual circumstances. Bu t all this is more Tenth Insight information about the Afterlife that clarifies our spiritual experience on Ear th, particularly the perception of coincidences, and how synchronicity really operates. \"When we have an intuition or a d ream to pursue a p articular cou rse in our lives and we follow this guidance, certain events transpire that feel like magic coi ncidences. We feel more alive and excited. The events seem destined, as though they were supposed to happen. \"What we just saw puts all this into a h igher perspective."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"When we have an intuition, a m ental image of a p ossible future, we're actually getting flashes of memory of our Birth Vision, what we wanted to be doing with our lives at that particular point on our journey. It may not be exact, because people have free will, but when something happens that is close to ou r original vision, we feel inspired because we recognize that we are on a p ath of destiny that we intended all along.\" \"But how does our soul group fit in?\" \"We're con nected with them. They know us. They share our Birth Visions, follow us through life, and afterward stay with us -i while we review what happened. They act as a reservoir for our memories, maintaining the knowledge of who we are as we evolve.\" He paused momentarily, looki ng straight into m y eyes. \"And apparently, when we're in the Afterlife, and one of them is born into the physical dimension, we act in the same cap acity toward them. We becom e part of the soul group that supports them,\" \"So while we are on Ear th,\" I com mented, \"our soul groups give us our intuition and direction?\" \"No, not at all. judging from what I cou ld pick u p from the soul groups I've seen, the intuitions and dreams are our own, com ing from a h igher connection with the divine. The soul groups just send us extra energy and uplift us in a p articular manner-a m anner that I haven't been able to pinpoint. By uplifting us in this way, they help us to m ore readily remember what we already knew.\" I was fascinated. \"So that explains what was happening with my dream and Joel's.\" ,,Yes. Wh en we dream, we reunite with our soul group, and that jogs our memory of what we really wanted to do in our current life situation. We get glimpses of our original intention Then when we return to the physical, we retain that memory, although it is sometimes expressed in archetypal symbols. In the cas e of your dream, because you are more open to spiritual meaning, you cou ld remember the dream information in very literal terms. You recalled that in your original intention, you saw us finding each other again when you imaged my face, and so you dreamed almost exactly that. \"Joel, on the other hand, was less open; his dream cam e through in a more garbled, symbolic fashion. H is memory was fuzzy, and his con scious mind fashioned the message in the symbolism of a w ar, con veying to him only the general message that in his Birth Vision he intended to stay and help with the current problem in the val ley, making it clear that if he ran away he would regret it.\" \"So the soul groups are always sending us energy,\" I said, and hoping we will remember our Birth Visions?\" \"That's right.\" \"And that's why May a's group was so happy?\""},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Wil's expression grew more serious. \"They were happy because she was remembering why she was born to her particular parents, and how her life experiences had prepared her for a car eer in healing. Bu t . . . t his was only the first part of her Birth Vision. She still has more to remember.\" Isaw the part when she was meeting again in this life with the man with whom she was killed in the nineteenth century. Bu t there were other parts that I cou ldn't understand. H ow much of that did you get?\" \"Not all of it. There was more about the rising Fear. It con firmed that she's part of the group of seven that Williams saw com ing back. A nd she saw the group able to remember some kind of larger vision that's behind our individual intentions, a remembrance that is necessary if we are to dispel the Fear.\" Wil and I gazed at each other for a long time, then I felt another vibration in my body from the experiment. In that moment an image of the large man with whom May a had seen herself reuniting cam e into m y mind. Wh o was he? I was about to m ention the image to Wi l, when my breath left me, forced out by a cr amping pain that seized my stomach. Simultaneously, another high-pitched screech rocke d me backw ard. As before, I reached out for Wil and saw his face fading out of focus. I struggled to look on e more time, then com pletely lost my equilibrium, slipping again into free fall. OPENING TO THE KNOWLEDGE Damn, I thought-lying flat on the rock, the coar se surface of the stone edging into m y back-I was back at the stream again. For a long moment I stared up at the gray sky, now threatening rain, listening to the water flow past me. I raised up on one elbow and looke d around, noticing immediately that my body felt heavy and fatigued, just as it had the last time I left the other dimension. Clumsily I got to m y feet, a slight pain throbbing in my ankle, and limped back i nto the forest. I uncove red my pack an d prepared some food , moving very slowly without thinking. Eve n as I ate, my mind remained surprisingly blank, like after a long meditation. Then slowly I began to increase my energy, taking several deep breaths and holding them. Suddenly I cou ld hear the hum again. As I listened, another image cam e to m ind. I was walking east in the direction of the sound, in search of its cau se. The thought terrified me and I felt the old urge to flee. Instantly the hum van ished, and I heard a rustling of leaves to m y rear. I jerked around and saw May a. \"Do you always show up at the right time?\" I stammered. \"Show up! Are you crazy? I've been looki ng for you everywhere around here. Wh ere did you com e from?\" \"I was down by the stream.\""},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"\"No, you weren't; I've been looki ng down there.\" She stared at me for a moment, then glanced at my foot. \"How's that ankle?\" I managed a smile. \"It's fine. Listen, I've got to talk to you about something.\" \"I have to speak w ith you too. T here's something very strange happening. O ne of the Forest Service agents saw me walking into town last night, and I told him about your situation. H e seemed to want to keep it quiet, and he insisted on sending a truck t o get you this morning. I told him your general locat ion, and he made me promise to ride out here with him this morning. Something about the way he was talking felt so od d, I decided to hike up ahead of him instead, but he'll probably be here any minute.\" \"Then we need to go,\" I said, scrambling to pack. \"Wai t a m inute! Tell me what is happening.\" She looke d panicked. I stopped and faced her. \"Someone-I don't know who it is-is doing some kind of experiment or something like that here in the val ley. I think my friend Charlene is involved somehow, or may be in danger. Someone in the Forest Service must have secretly approved this.\" She stared, trying to take it all in. I picked up my pack an d took h er hand. \"Wal k with me for a w hile. Please. There's more I need to tell you.\" She nodded and grabbed her pack, and as we walked east along the edge of the stream, I told her the whole story, from meeting David and Wil to seeing Williams' Life Review and hstening to Joel. Wh en I cam e to the part about her Birth Vision, I moved ove r to some rocks and sat down. She leaned against a tree to m y right. \"You're involved in this too,\" I said. \"Obviously you already know that your life is supposed to be about introducing alternative techniques of healing, but there's more that you intended to do. Y ou're supposed to be part of this group that Williams saw com ing together.\" \"How do you know all that?\" \"Wil and I saw your Birth Vision.\" She shook h er head and closed her eyes. \"May a, each of us com es here with a vi sion of how our lives can be, what we want to do. T he intuitions we have, the dreams and coi ncidences, they're all designed to ke ep us on the right path, to bring back ou r memory of how we wanted our lives to unfold.\" \"And what else did I want to do?\" \"I don't know exactly; I cou ldn't get it. Bu t it had something Lo do with this col lective Fear that is rising in human con sciousness. The experiment is a result of this Fear ... May a, you intended to use what you've learned about physical healing to help resolve what's happening in this val ley. You must remember!\" She stood and looke d away. \"Oh no, you can 't put that kind of"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"responsibility on me! I don't remember any of this. I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing as a d octor. I hate this kind of intrigue! Un derstand? I hate it! I finally have the clinic set up just as I want. You can 't expect me to get involved in all this. You've got the wrong person!\" I looke d at her, trying to think of something else to say. During the silence, I heard the hum again. \"Can you hear that sound, May a, a d issonance in the air, a h um? That's the experiment. It's happening right now. Try to hear it!\" She listened for a m oment, then said, \"I don't hear anything.\" I grabbed her arm. \"Try to raise your energy!\" She pulled away. \"I don't hear a h um!\" I took a b reath. \"Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. May be it's not supposed to happen this way.\" She looke d at me for a m oment. \"I know someone with the Sheriff's Department. I'll try to get in touch with him for you. That's all I can do.\" \"I don't know if that will help,\" I said. \"Apparently not everyone can hear this sound.\" \"Do you want me to cal l him?\" \"Yes, but tell him to investigate independently. I'm not sure he can trust everyone in the Forest Service.\" I picked up my pack ag ain. \"I hope you understand,\" she said. \"I just can 't be involved in this. I feel as though something horrible would happen.\" \"But that's just because of what happened when you tried this f before, in the nineteenth century, here in this val ley. Can you remember any of that?\" She closed her eyes again, not wanting to listen. I suddenly saw a cl ear image of myself in buckskins, running up a h ill, pulling a p ackh orse. It was the same image I had seen before. The mountain man was me! As the vision con tinued, I made my way to the top of the hill and then paused to glance back t o m y rear. From there I could see the falls and the gorge on the other side. There was May a an d the Indian and the young congressional aide. As before, the battle was just beginnin Anxiety swept ove r me, and I pulled at the horse and walked on, unable to help them avoi d their fate. I shook of f the images. \"It's okay ,\" I said, giving up. \"I know how you feel.\" May a walked closer. \"Here's some extra water and food I brought. Wh at are you planning to do?\" \"I'm going to head toward the east ... f or at least a w hile. I know"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Charlene was going in that direction.\" She looke d at my foot. \"Are you sure your ankle will hold up?\" I moved closer and said, \"I haven't really thanked you for what you did. My ankle will be fine, I think, just a little sore. I guess I'll never know how bad it might have been.\" \"When it happens this way, no on e ever does.\" I nodded, then picked up my pack an d headed east, glancing back on ce at May a. S he looke d guilty for an instant, than an expression of relief swept acr oss her face. walked toward the sound of the hum, keeping the stream in sight to m y left, pausing only to rest my foot. About noon the sound ceased, so I stopped to eat lunch and assess the situation. My ankle was swelling slightly and I rested for an hour and a h alf before resuming my journey. After cove ring only another mile, fatigue overwhelmed me, and I rested again. By midafternoon I was looki ng for a place to cam p. I had been walking through thick w ood s that grew right to the edge of the stream, but ahead the landscape opened up in a series of gently rolling foothills cove red with old-growth forestthree- an d four-hundred-year-old trees. Through a b reak i n the limbs, I cou ld see a large ridge rising toward the southeast, perhaps another mile away. I spotted a small grassy knoll near the top of the first hill, which looke d like a p erfect place to spend the night. As I approach ed, movement in the trees cau ght my eye. I slipped behind a large outcropping and looke d. Wh at was that? A deer? A person? I waited for several minutes, then car efully moved away toward the north. As I inched along, I saw a large man a h undred yards to the south of the knoll I had seen before, apparently setting up a cam p himself. Staying very low to the ground and moving with skill, he deftly raised a small tent and cam ouflaged it with branches. For an instant I thought it might be David, but his movements were different, and he was too b ig. Then I lost sight of him. After waiting for several more minutes I decided to m ove farther to the north until I was com pletely out of sight. I'd been moving no m ore than five minutes when the man suddenly stepped out in front of me. \"Who ar e you?\" he asked. I told him my name and decided to be open. \"I'm trying to find a friend.\" \"It's dangerous out here,\" he said. \"I would recom mend that you go back. T his is all private property.\" \"Why are you out here?\" I asked. He was silent, staring. Then I remembered what David had told me. \"Are you Curtis We bber?\" I inquired. He looke d at me for a m oment longer, then abruptly smiled."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"\"You know David Lone Eag le!\" \"I only talked to him briefly, but he told me you were out here, and to tell you he was com ing into the val ley and that he would find you.\" Curtis nodded and looke d toward his cam p. \"It's getting late, and we need to get out of sight. Let's go up to m y tent. You can spend the night up there.\" I followed him down a slope and up into the deep cove r of the larger trees. Wh ile I pitched my tent, he fired up his cam p stove for cof fee and opened a can of tuna. I con tributed a p ackag e of bread May a had given me. \"You mentioned that you were looki ng for someone,\" Curtis said. \"Who?\" Briefly I told him about Charlene's disappearance and that David had seen her hiking into the val ley; also that I thought she had been seen com ing in this direction. I didn't talk ab out what had occu rred in the other dimension, but I did mention hearing the hum and seeing the vehicles. \"The hum,\" he responded, \"com es from an energy-generating device; someone's experimenting with it here for some reason. I can con firm that much. Bu t I don't know whether the experiment is being con ducted by some secret government agency or a p rivate group. Mos t of the Forest Service agents seem to be unaware that it's happening; but I don't know about the administrators.\" \"Have you gone to the media,\" I asked, \"or to the local authorities about this?\" \"Not yet. The fact that not everyone hears the hum is a real problem.\" He looke d out at the val ley. \"If I just knew where they were. Counting the private land and the Nat ional Forest, there are tens of thousands of acres where they might be. I think they want to con duct the experiment and get out before anyone knows what happened. That is, if they can avoi d a tragedy.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"They cou ld totally ruin this place, make it into a t wilight zon e, another Bermuda Triangle where the laws of physics are in unpredictable flux.\" He looke d directly at me. \"The things they know how to do ar e incredible. Mos t people have no idea of the com plexity of electromagnetic phenomena. I n the latest superstring theories, for instance, one has to as sume this radiation emanates acr oss nine dimensions just to m ake the math work. T his device has the potential to disrupt these dimensions. It cou ld trigger massive earthquakes or even com plete physical disintegration of certain areas.\" \"How do you know all this?\" I asked. His face fell. \"Because in the decade of the eighties I helped develop some of this technology. I was employed with a m ultinational corporation I thought was named Deltech, although later, after I was fired, I found out that Deltech was a fictitious name. You've heard of Nikola Tesla? We ll, we expanded many of his theories and tied some of his discove ries to ot her technologies that the com pany supplied. The funny thing is that this technology is com posed of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"several dissimilar parts, but basically it works this way. Imagine that the electromagnetic field of the Ear th is a g iant battery that can provide plenty of electrical energy if you can tie into it in the correct way. For that you com bine a room temperature, superconductive generator system with a ve ry com plicated electronic feedback i nhibitor, which mathematically enhances certain static ou tput resonances. Then you tie several of these in a series, am plifying and generating the charge, and when you get the cal ibrations exact, presto, you have virtually free energy right out of the immediate space. You need a small am ount of power to start, perhaps a single photocell or a b attery, but then it's self-perpetuating. A device the size of a h eat pump cou ld power several houses, even a small factory. \"However, there are two problems. First, cal ibrating these minigenerators is unbelievably com plicated. We had acce ss to some of the largest com puters in existence and cou ldn't do it. Second, we discove red that when we tried to increase the total output beyond this relatively small size by enlarging the mass displacement, the space around the generator becam e very unstable and began to warp. We didn't know it then, but we were tapping into the energy of another dimension, and strange things began to happen. O nce, we made the whole generator disappear, exactly like what happened in the Philadelphia Experiment.\" \"Do you think they really made a ship disappear and show up again in a new locat ion, in 19437 \"Of cou rse they did! There's a lot of secret technology around, and they're smart. In our cas e, they were able to shut our team down in less than a m onth and fire all of us without a b reach of security because each team was working on an isolated part of the technology. Not that I wondered much about it then. I mostly bought the idea that the obstacles were just too g reat to proceed, so I thought it was dead-end research-although I did hear that several of the old employees were hired again by another com pany.\" He looke d thoughtful for a m oment, then con tinued. \"I knew I wanted to do something else anyway. I'm a con sultant now, working with small technology firms, providing advice for improving their research efficiency and use of resources and disposal of wastes, that sort of thing. And the more I work with them, the more I'm con vinced the insights are having an effect on the economy. The way we do business is shifting. Bu t I figured we had to work with traditional power sources for a long time. I hadn't thought about the energy experiments in years until I moved into this area. Y ou can imagine how shocke d I was to walk into this val ley and hear the same sound-this characteristic hum-that I heard every day for years when we were working on the project. \"Someone has con tinued the research, and judging from the onances, they're much further along than we were. Afterwar res I tried to con tact the two p people who cou ld verify the sound and maybe go to the EPA or a con gressional com mittee with me, but I found out one had been deceased for ten years and the other, my best friend when I was at the cor poration, was also dead. H e had a h eart attack just yesterday.\" His voi ce trailed off. \"Since then,\" he went on, \"I've been out here listening, trying to"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"figure out why they're in this val ley. O rdinarily one would expect this kind of experiment to be done in a laboratory somewhere. I mean, why not? Its energy source is space itself, and that's everywhere. Bu t then it dawned on me. They must think they are very close to perfecting the cal ibrations, which means they're working on the am plification problem. I think they're trying to tie into the energy vor texes in this valley in an attempt to stabilize the process.\" A wave of anger crossed his face. \"Which is crazy and totally unnecessary. If they really can find the cal ibrations, then there's no reason not to utilize the technology in small units. In fact, that's the perfect way of using it. Wh at they're trying now is ine. I know enough to see the dangers. I'm telling you, they san cou ld totally wreck t his val ley, or worse. if they focus this thing on the interdimensional pathways, who kn ows what might happen?\" He stopped suddenly. \"Do you know what I'm talking about? Have you heard of the Insights?\" I stared for a m oment, then said, \"Curtis, I have to tell you what I've been experiencing in this val ley. You may find it unbelievable.\" He nodded and then listened patiently as I described meeting Wil and exploring parts of the other dimension. Wh en I cam e to the Life Review, I asked, \"This friend of yours who recently died? Was he named Williams?\" \"That's right. Dr. Wi lliams. H ow did you know that?\" \"We saw him reach the other dimension after his death. We watched as he experienced a L ife Review.\" He appeared shaken. \"That's hard for me to believe. I know the Insights, at least intellectually, and I believe in the probable existence of other dimensions, but as a scientist, the Ninth Insight stuff is much harder to take literally, the idea of being able to com municate with people after death. You're saying that Dr. Wi lliams is still alive in the serise that his personality is intact?\" 'Yes, and he was thinking about you.\" He looke d at me intently as I con tinued to tell him about Williams'realization that Curtis and he were supposed to be involved in resolving the Fear ... an d stopping this experiment. \"I don't understand,\" he said. \"What did he mean when he talked about a growing Fear?\" \"I don't know exactly. It has to do with a ce rtain percentage of the population refusing to believe that a n ew spiritual awareness is emerging. Instead, they think human civilization is degenerating. This is creating a p olarization of opinion and belief. Human culture can 't con tinue to evolve until the polarization is ended. I was hoping that you n-light remember something about it.\" He looke d at me blankly. \"I don't know anything about a p olarization, but I am going to stop this experiment.\" His face grew angry again and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"he looke d away. \"Williams seemed to understand the process for stopping it,\" I said. \"Well, we'll never know now, will we?\" As he said that, I fleetingly saw again the image of Curtis and Williams talking on the grassy hilltop, surrounded by several large trees. Curtis served our food , still appearing upset, and we finished eating in silence. Later as I stretched out and leaned against a small hickor y, I glanced up the hill at the grassy knoll above us. Four or five huge oaks made almost a p erfect semicircle on its crest. \"Why didn't you cam p up on the hill?\" I asked Curtis, pointing. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"The idea cam e to m e, but I guess I thought it was too e xposed, or maybe too p owerful. It's cal led Codder's Knoll. Do you want to walk up there?\" I nodded and rose to m y feet. A gray twilight was descending acr oss the forest. Commenting on the beauty of the trees and shrubs as we walked, Curtis led the way up the slope. At the top, in spite of the fading light, we cou ld see almost a q uarter of a m ile toward the north and east. In the latter direction a n ear full moon was rising above the tree line. \"Better sit down,\" Curtis advised. \"We don't want to be seen.\" For a long while we sat in silence, admiring the view and feeling the energy. Curtis took a f lashlight out of his pocke t and laid it on the ground beside him. I was mesmerized by the col ors of the fall foliage. Presently Curtis looke d ove r at me and asked, \"Do you smell something, smoke ?\" I immediately looke d out at the wood s, suspecting a forest fire, and sniffed the air. \"No, I don't think so.\" Something about Curtis' demeanor was shifting the mood , introducing a feeling of sadness or nostalgia. \" What kind of smoke do you mean?\" \"Cigar smoke.\" In the growing moon light I cou ld tell he was smiling reflectively, thinking about something. Then suddenly I began to smell the smoke. \"What is that?\" I asked, looki ng around again. He cau ght my eye, \"Dr. Wi lliams smoked cigars that smelled just like that. I can 't believe he's gone.\" As we talked, the smell subsided and I dismissed the whole experience, content to stare out at the sage and the large oaks beside us. In that moment I realized that this was the very spot where Williams saw himself meeting with Curtis. it was to take place right here! Seconds later I observed a figure forming just beyond the trees. \"Do you see anything out there?\" I quietly asked Curtis, pointing in that direction."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"As soon as I spoke , the form disappeared. Curtis was straining to see. \"What? I don't see anything.\" I didn't respond. Somehow I had begun to intuitively receive knowledge, exactly as I had received it from the soul groups, except the con nection was more distant and garbled. I cou ld sense something abou-. t he energy experiment, a con firmation of Curtis' suspicions; the experimenters were indeed attempting to focus in on the dimensional vortexes. \"I just remembered\" Curtis said abruptly. \"One of the devices Dr. Williams was working on years ago was a remote focus, a d ish projection system. I bet that's what they're using to focus on the openings. Bu t how do they know where the openings are?\" Immediately I perceived an answer. Someone of a h igher awareness pointed them out until they learned the spatial var iances as they showed up on the remote focus com puter. I had no idea what that meant. \"There's only one way,\" Curtis said. \"They would have to find someone to point them out-someone who cou ld sense these higher energy locat ions. Then they cou ld map out an energy profile of the site and focus precisely by scanning with a focus beam. Probably the individual wouldn't even know what they were doing.\" He shook h is head. \"These people are vicious. There's no doubt about it. How cou ld they do this?\" As if in response, I sensed other knowledge that was too vag ue to understand com pletely, but seemed to m aintain that there was, in fact, a reason. Bu t we had to first understand the Fear and how to ove rcom e it. When I looke d at Curtis, he seemed to be deep in thought. Finally he looke d at me and said, \"I wish I knew why this Fear is com ing up now.\" \"During a transition in culture,\" I said, \"old certainties and views begin to break d own and evolve into new traditions, cau sing anxiety in the short run. At the same time that some people are waking up and sustaining an inner con nection of love that sustains them and allows them to evolve more rapidly, others feel as though everything is changing too f ast and that we're losing our way. They becom e more fearful and more con trolling to try to raise their energy. This polarization of fear can be very dangerous because fearful people can rationalize extreme measures.\" As I was saying all of this, I felt as though I was expanding on what I had earlier heard Wil say, and Williams, but I also had the distinct sensation that it was something I knew all along but didn't realize I knew until this very moment. \"I understand that,\" Curtis said with certainty. \"That's why these people are so willing to waste this val ley. They rationalize that civilization will fall apart in the future, and they won't be safe unless they seize more con trol. We ll, I'm not going to al low it to happen. I'll blow the whole thing sky-high.\" I looke d hard at him. \"What do you mean?\""},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"\"Just that. I used to be a d emolitions expert. I know how.\" I must have looke d alarmed because he said, \"Don't worry, I'll figure out a w ay to do it where no on e gets hurt. I wouldn't want that on my conscience.\" A wave of knowledge filled me. \"Any kind of violence,\" I said, \"just makes it worse, don't you see?\" \"What other way is there?\" Out of the cor ner of my eye I glimpsed the form again for an instant, and then it disappeared. \"I don't know exactly,\" I said, \"But if we fight them with anger, hate, they just see an enemy. It makes them more entrenched. They becom e more fearful. Somehow this group that Williams was talking about is supposed to do something else. We 're supposed to fully remember our Birth Visions ... an d then we can remember something more, a Wor ld Vision. Somehow I knew the term, but I cou ldn't remember where I had heard it before. \"A Wor ld Vision, . . \" Curtis pondered, deep in thought again. \"I think David Lone Eag le mentioned that.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"That's right.\" \"What do you think a Wor ld Vision is?\" I was about to say I didn't know when a thought cam e to m e. \"It's an understanding-no, a m emory-of how we will fulfill human purpose. it brings in another level of love, an energy, that can bridge the polarization, end this experiment.\" \"I don't see how that's possible,\" Curtis said. \"It involves the energy level around people who ar e in Fear,\" I said, somehow knowing. \"They would be touched, awakened from their preoccu pation. They would choose to stop.\" For several moments we were silent, then Cunis said, \"May be, but how do we bring in this energy?\" Nothing more cam e to m ind. \"I wish I knew how far they're prepared to go with ths experiment,\" he added. \"What cau ses the hum?\" I asked. \"The hum is a linking dissonance between the small generators. It means that they're still trying to cal ibrate the deNice. The more grating and disharmonious it is, the more it's out o, phase.\" He thought for another moment. \"I just wonder which energy vortex they're going to focus on.\" I suddenly sensed a p articular nervousness, not within myself, but"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"outwardly, as if I was around someone else who was anxious. I looke d at Curtis, who seemed relatively cal m Beyond the trees I again saw the vague outlines of a form. it mcved as if agitated or frightened. \"I would imagine,\" Curtis said absently, \"that if Cne were close to the target locat ion, one would hear the hum gnd then feel a ki nd of static electricity in the air.\" We looke d at each other, and in the silence I cou ld hear a faint sound, merely a vi bration. \"Do you hear that?\" Curtis asked, now alarmed. As I looke d at him, I felt the hair rise on the back of my neck and forearms. \"What is this?\" For an instant Curtis observed his own arms, then looke d at me in horror. gralbing his \"We've got to get out of here!\" he screamed, flashlight, leaping to his feet, and half dragging me off the crest of the slope. Suddenly the same ear-shattering roar I had heard with Wil descended again and car ried with it a shock w ave that knocke d both of us to the ground. Simultaneously the earth beneath us shook vi olently and a massive fissure opened twenty feet away, creating an explosion of dust and debris. Behind us one of the towering oaks , undermined by the shifting earth, leaned and then fell to the ground in a thunderous roar, adding to the noise. Seconds later another, larger fissure tore open right beside us and the ground tilted. Curtis, unable to hold on, slid toward the widening abyss. I held onto a s mall bush and reached out for Curtis' hand. For a m oment we held tight, then our grip slipped, and I watched helplessly as he slid ove r the edge. The fissure moved and widened, spewed another plume of dust and rock, shook on ce more, and then was still. A limb under the fallen tree cracke d loudly, and then the ni ht was again silent. As the dust cleared, I let go of the bush and crawled toward the edge of the massive hole. Wh en I cou ld see, I realized that Curtis was lying prone at the edge, even though I was sure I had seen him fall in. H e rolled toward me and jumped to his feet. \"Let's go!\" he yelled. \"It cou ld start again!\" Without speaking we ran down the hill toward the cam psite, Curtis ahead, me limping behind. Wh en Curtis reached the site, he seized both tents and ripped them from the ground, stakes dangling, and stuffed them into the packs . I pushed in the other gear, and we con tinued toward the southwest until the ground flattened into thick u nderbrush. After another half mile, exhaustion and my weakening ankle forced me to stop. Curtis surveyed the terrain. \"May be we'll be safe here,\" he said, \"but let's move deeper into the thicket.\" I followed as he led us fifty feet farther into the dense wood s. \"This will do right here,\" he com mented. \"Let's put up the tents.\" Within a cou ple of minutes both tents were up and cove red with limbs and we were looki ng at each other breathlessly, sitting on his tent's large"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"entrance flap. \"What do you think happened?\" I asked. Curtis' face looke d gaunt as he dug into his pack f or water. \"They're doing exactly what we thought,\" he said. \"They're trying to focus the generator on a remote space.\" He took a l ong drink from his canteen. \"They're going to ruin this val ley; these people have to be stopped.\" \"What about the smoke we smelled?\" \"I don't know what to think,\" Curtis said. \"It was as though Dr. Williams was there. I cou ld almost hear his inflection, his tone of voice, what he would have said in that situation.\" I cau ght Curtis' eye. I think he was there.\" Curtis handed me the can teen. \"How is that possible?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"But I think he cam e to con vey a m essage, a message to you. Wh en we saw him during his Life Review, he was agonizing because he had failed to wake up, to remember why he had been born. H e was con vinced that you were supposed to be a p art of this group he mentioned. Can't you remember anything about that? I think he wanted you to kn ow that violence won't stop these people. We have to do it another way, with this Wor ld Vision that David talked about.\" He gave me a b lank look. \"What about when the earth movement started,\" I asked, and that fissure opened? I know I saw you roll in, yet you were lying at the edge when I got there.\" He looke d totally perplexed. \"I'm not sure really. I cou ldn't hold on and was slipping into the hole. As I dropped down, this A incredibly peaceful feeling cam e Over me, and I was cushioned, like falling onto a s oft mattress. All I cou ld see was a w hite blur around me. The next thing I knew I was lying at the side of the fissure again and you were there. Do you think Dr. Wi lliams cou ld have done that?\" \"I don't think so,\" I said. \"I had a similar experience yesterday. I was almost crushed by stories and I saw the same white form. Something else is happening.\" Curtis stared at me for a m oment and then said something else, but I didn't respond. I was drifting into sleep. \"Let's turn in,\" he said. Curtis was already up when I climbed out of my tent. The morning was clear, but a g round fog cove red the forest floor. Instantly I knew he was angry. \"I can 't stop thinking about what they're doing,\" he said. \"And they aren't going to give up.\" He took a b reath. \"By now they've"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"figured out what a m ess they made on the hill. They'll spend some time recalibrating, but not for long, and then they'll try again. I can stop them but we have to find out where they are.\" \"Curtis, violence just makes it worse.

We have to discove r how to use the Vision.\" \"No!\" he shouted with deep emotion. \"I've tried that before!\" I looke d at him. \"When?\" His expression changed to con fusion. \"I don't know.\" \"Well,\" I stressed, \"I think I do.\" He waved me off with his hand. \"I don't want to hear it. This is too crazy. Eve rything that's happening is my fault. if I hadn't worked on this technology, they might not be doing this. I'm going to handle it my way.\" He walked ove r and began packi ng. I hesitated, then started taking down my own tent, trying to think. After a m oment I said, \"I've already sent for some help. A woman I met, May a, thinks she can persuade the Sheriff's Department to investigate this. I want you to promise me you'll give me some time.\" He was kneeling beside his backp ack, checking a b ulging side pocke t. \"I can't do that. I may have to act when I can .\" \"You have explosives in your pack?\" He walked toward me. \"I told you before I'm not going to hurt anyone.\" \"I want some time,\" I repeated. \"If I can reach Wil again, I think I can find out about this Wor ld Vision.\" \"Okay,\" he said. \"I'll give you as long as I can , but if they start experimenting again, and I think I'm out of time, I'll have to do something.\" As he spoke, I saw Wil's face again in my mind's eye, surrounded by a rich emerald col or. \"Is there another high-energy locat ion near here?\" I asked. He pointed south. \"Somewhere up the big ridge, there's a rock ove rhang I've heard about. Bu t that's private land that was recently sold. I don't know who ow ns it now.\" \"I'm going to look f or it. if I can find the right place, then maybe I can locat e Wil again.\" Curtis finished packi ng and helped me tie up my own gear and spread leaves and branches where the tents had been. Toward the northwest we cou ld hear the faint sound of vehicles. \"I'm heading east,\" he said."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I nodded as he walked away, then pulled my pack on to m y shoulders and started up the rocky slope to the south. I traveled over several small hills and then tackl ed the steep incline of the main ridge. About halfway up I began to look t hrough the dense forest for an overhang but found no sign of an opening. After climbing several hundred more yards I stopped again. Still no ou tcropping, and I cou ld see none at the crest of the ridge above. I was con fused about which way to go an d decided to sit down and attempt to raise my energy. After a few minutes I felt better, and was listening to the sounds of birds and tree frogs in the thick l imbs ove r my head, when a large golden eagle fluttered from its nest and flew east along the top of the ridge. I knew the presence of the bird had meaning, so, as with the hawk before, I decided to follow. G radually the slope becam e more rocky . I crossed a small spring flowing from the rocks and refilled my can teen and washed my face. Finally, a h alf mile farther, I pushed my way through a g rove of small fir trees, and there before me lay the majestic overhang. Almost half an acr e of the slope was cove red with huge terraces of thick l imestone, and at the farthermost edge, a twenty-foot-wide shelf jutted out at least forty feet from the ridge, providing a spectacular view of the val ley below. For an instant I detected a d ark emerald highlight around the lower shelf. I took of f my pack an d pushed it out of sight under a p ile of leaves and then walked out and sat on the ledge. As I centered myself, the image of Wil cam e easily to m ind. I took on e more deep breath and began to move. A HISTORY OF AWAKENING When I opened my eyes, I was in an area of rich blue light, feeling the now-familiar sense of well-being and peace. I cou ld detect Wil's presence to m y left. As before, he looke d enormously relieved and happy that I had returned. He moved closer and whispered, \"You are going to love it here.\" 'X \"Where are we?\" I asked. \"Look m ore closely-,, I shook m y head. \"I have to talk to you first. It's imperative that we find this experiment and stop them. They've destroyed a h illtop. G od knows what they're about to do next.\" \"What will we do if we find them?\" Wil inquired. \"I don't know.\" \"Well, neither do 1. Tell me what happened.\" I closed my eyes and tried to ce nter, then described the experience of seeing May a ag ain, particularly her resistance to m y suggestion that she"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"was part of the group. Wil nodded without com ment. I went on to describe meeting Curtis, com municating with Williams, and surviving the effects of the experiment. \"Williams spoke to you?\" Wil asked. \"Not really. The com munication wasn't mental, as with you and me. H e seemed to be influencing the ideas that were com ing to us in some way. It felt like information I already knew at some level; yet both of us seemed to be saying what he was trying to com municate. It was odd, but I know he was there.\" \"What was his message?\" \"He con firmed what you and I saw with May a; he said we cou ld remember beyond our individual birth intentions to a b road er knowledge of human purpose and how we cou ld com plete this purpose. Apparently, remembering this knowledge brings in an expanded energy that can end the Fear ... and this experiment. H e cal led it a Wor ld Vision.\" Wil was silent. \"What do you think?\" I asked. \"I think al l this is just more of the Tenth Insight knowledge. Please understand: I share your sense of urgency. Bu t the only way we can help is to con tinue exploring the Afterlife until we find out about this larger Vision that Williams was trying to com municate. There must be an exact process for remembering what it is.\" In the distance a m ovement cau ght my eye. Ei ght or ten very distinct beings, only partially out of focus, moved to within fifty feet. Be hind them were dozens more, blended together in the usual am ber-col ored blur. All of them exuded a p articular feeling of sentiment and nostalgia that was distinctly familiar. \"Do you know who these souls are?\" Wil asked, smiling broad ly. I looke d out at the group, sensing kinship. I did know, but I didn't. As I looke d upon the soul group, the emotional con nection con tinued to grow more intense, beyond anything I cou ld remember ever experiencing. Yet, at the same time, the closeness was recognizable; I had been here before. The group moved within twenty feet of me, increasing the euphoria an d acce ptance even more. I gladly let go, turning myself ove r to the feeling, wishing only to bask in it--con tentperhaps for the first time in my life. Wave s of ackn owledgment and appreciation filled my mind. \"Have you figured it out?\" Wil asked again. I turned and looke d at him. \"This is my soul group, isn't it?\" With that thought cam e a flood of memories. Thirteenthcentury France, a monastery and cou rtyard. All around me a g roup of monks, laughter, closeness, then walking alone on a w ood ed road . Two ragged men,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ascetics, asking for help, something about preserving some secret knowledge. I shook of f the vision and looke d at Wil, gripped by a p erverse fear. What was I about to see? I attempted to ce nter, and my soul group edged four feet closer. \"What is happening?\" Wil asked. \"I cou ldn't quite understand.\" I described what I had observed. \"Probe further,\" Wil suggested. Immediately I saw the ascetics again, and somehow knew they were members of a secret order of Franciscan \"Spirituals\" who had recently been excom municated, after Pope Celestine V had resigned. Pope Celestine? I glanced at Wil. \"Did you get that? I never knew there were popes by that name.\" \"Celestine V was late thirteenth century,\" Wil con firmed. \"The ruins in Peru, where the Ninth Insight was ultimately found, were named after him when first discove red in the 1600s.\" \"Who were the Spirituals?\" \"They were a g roup of monks who believed that a h igher awareness cou ld be ach ieved by extracting themselves from human culture and returning to a con templative life in nature. Pope Celestine supported this idea an d, in fact, lived in a cave himself for a w hile. H e was deposed, of cou rse, and later, most sects of the Spirituals were con demned as Gnostics and excom municated.\" Mor e memories surfaced. The two as cetics had approach ed me asking for help, and I had reluctantly met with them deep in the forest. I had had no ch oice, so entrancing were their eyes and the fearlessness of their demeanor. O ld documents were in great danger of being lost forever, they told me. Later I had smuggled them back t o the abbey and had read them by can dlelight in my chambers, the doors closed and locke d securely. These documents were old Latin cop ies of the Nine Insights, and I had consented to cop y them before it was too l ate, working every moment of my spare time to painstakingly reproduce dozens of the manuscripts. At one point I was so enthralled by the Insights that I sought to persuade the ascetics to m ake them public. They adamantly refused, explaining that they had held the documents for many centuries, waiting for the cor rect understanding to emerge within the church. Wh en I questioned the meaning of this latter phrase, they explained that the Insights would not be acce pted until the church reconciled what they referred to as the Gnostic dilemma. The Gnostics, I somehow remembered, were early Christians who believed that followers of the one God should not merely revere Christ but strive to emulate him in the spirit of Pentecost. They sought to describe this emulation in philosophical terms, as a method of practice. As the early church formulated its can ons, the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Gnostics were eventually con sidered willful heretics, opposed to turning their lives ove r to God as a m atter of faith. To becom e a true believer, the early church leaders con cluded, one had to forgo understanding and analysis and be con tent to live life through divine revelation, adhering to God's will moment by moment, but con tent to remain ignorant of his ove rall plan. Accusing the church hierarchy of tyranny, the Gnostics argued that their understandings and methods were intended to act ually facilitate this act of \"letting go to God's will\" that the church was requiring, rather than giving mere lip service to the idea, as the churchmen were doing. In the end the Gnostics lost, and were banished from all church functions and texts, their beliefs disappearing underground am ong the various secret sects and orders. Yet the dig lemma was clear. As long as the church held out the vision of a transformative spiritual connection with the divine, yet persecuted anyone who talked openly about the specifics of the experience-how one might act ually attain such an awareness, what it felt like-then the \"kingdom within\" would remain merely an intellectualized con cept within church doctrine, and the Insights would be crushed anytime they surfaced. At the moment, I listened with con cern to the ascetics and said nothing, but inwardly I disagreed. I was sure the Benedictine Order of which I was a p art would be interested in these writings, especially at the level of the individual monk. L ater, without telling the Spirituals, I shared a cop y with a friend who was the closest adviser to Cardinal Nicholas in my district. Reaction cam e swiftly Wor d arrived that the car dinal was out of the cou ntry, but I was asked to ce ase any discussion of the subject and to depart at once for Nap les to report my findings to the car dinal's superiors. I panicked and immediately dispensed the manuscripts as widely as possible throughout the order, hoping that I might garner support from other interested brothers. In order to postpone my summons, I faked a severe ankle injury and wrote a series of letters explaining my disability, delaying the trip for months while I cop ied as many manuscripts as I cou ld in my isolation. Finally, on the night of a n ew moon , my door was kicked down by soldiers and I was beaten severely and taken blindfolded to the cas tle of the local noble, where I later languished at the stock f or days before being decapitated. The shock of remembering my death cas t me into fear again and created a powerful tingling in my injured ankle. The soul group con tinued to m ove several feet closer until I managed to ce nter myself. Still, I was left with a d egree of con fusion. A nod from Wil told me he had seen the entire story. \"This was the beginning of my ankle. problem, wasn't it?\" I asked. 'Yes,\" Wil replied. I cau ght his eye. \"What about all the other memories? Did you understand the Gnostic dilemma?\" He nodded and squared up to face me directly. \"Why would the church create such a d ilemma?\" I asked. \"Because the early church was afraid to com e out and say that Christ"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"modeled a w ay of life that each of us cou ld aspire to, although that is what is clearly said in the Scriptures. They feared that this position would give too m uch power to individuals, so they perpetrated the contradiction.

But on the other hand they con demned as blasphemous any discussion of how one might go ab out ach ieving these states, often resorting to outright murder to protect their power.\" \"So I was a fool for trying to ci rculate the Insights.\" \"I wouldn't say a fool,\" Wil mused, \"more like undiplomatic. You were killed because you tried to force an understanding into cu lture before its time.\" I looke d into Wi l's eyes for another moment, then drifted back i nto the knowledge of the group, finding myself at the scene of the nineteenth-century wars again. I was back at the meeting of chiefs in the val ley, holding the same packh orse, apparently just before departing. A mountain man and trapper, I was friends with both the Native Americans and the settlers. Almost all the Indians wanted to fight, but May a had won the hearts of some with her search for peace. Remaining silent, I listened to both sides, then watched as most of the chiefs had left. At one point May a walked up to m e. \"I suppose you're leaving too.\" I nodded affirmatively, explaining that if these Nat ive medicine chiefs didn't understand what she was doing, I surely didn't. She looke d at me as though I must be kidding, then, turning, she directed her attention to an other person. Charlene! I suddenly recalled that she had been there; she was an Indian woman of great power, but often ignored by the envious male chiefs because of her gender. She seemed to kn ow something important about the role of the ancestors, but her voi ce was falling on deaf ears. I saw myself wanting to stay, wanting to support May a, wanting to reveal my feelings for Charlene, yet in the end I walked away; the unconscious memory of my mistake in the thirteenth century was too cl ose to the surface. I wanted only to run away, avoi d any responsibility. My life pattern was set: I trapped for furs, I got along, and I didn't stick m y neck ou t for anyone. Perhaps I would do better next time. Next time? My mind raced forward, and I saw myself looki ng outward toward the Ear th, con templating my present incarnation. I was watching my own Birth Vision, seeing the full possibility of resolving my reluctance to act or to take a stand. I envisioned how I might utilize my early family to its greatest potential, learning spiritual sensitivity from my mother, integrity and fun from my father. A grandfather would provide a con nection with the wilderness, an uncle and aunt would provide a m odel for tithing and discipline. And being placed with such strong individuals would bring my tendency to"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"be aloof quickly into con sciousness. Be cause of their ego an d strong expectation, I would at first retreat from their messages, and try to hide, but then I would work through this fear and see the positive preparation they were giving me, clearing this tendency so that I cou ld fully follow my life path. It would be a p erfect preparation, and I would leave that upbringing looki ng for the details of spirituality I had seen in the Insights centuries before. I would explore the psychological descriptions of the Human Potential Move ment, the wisdom of Eas tern experience, the mystics of the We st, and then eventually I would run into the act ual Insights again, just at the time they were surfacing to be brought finally into mass awareness. All this preparation and clearing would then allow me to further explore how these Insights were changing human culture and to be a p art of Williams' group. I pulled back an d looke d at Wil. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. \"It hasn't exactly gone the ideal way for me either. I feel as if I've wasted the preparation. I haven't even cleared myself of the aloofness. There were so m any books I didn't read, so m any people that cou ld have given me messages that I ignored. Wh en I look b ack n ow, it seems as though I missed everything.\" Wil almost laughed. \"Non e of us can follow our Birth Visions exactly.\" He paused and stared. \"Do you realize what you're doing at this moment? You just remembered the ideal way you wanted your life to go, the way that would have given you the most satisfaction, and when you look at how you act ually lived, you are filled with regrets, just the way Williams felt after he died and saw all the opportunities he had missed. Instead of having to wait until after death, you're experiencing a L ife Review now.\" I cou ldn't quite understand. \"Don't you see? This has to be a ke y part of the Tenth. Not only are we discove ring that our intuitions and our sense of destiny in our lives are remembrances of our Birth Visions. As we understand the Sixth Insight more fully, we're analyzing where we have been off track or failed to take advantage of opportunities, so that we can immediately get back on a p ath more in line with why we cam e. In other words, we're bringing more of the process into con sciousness on a d ay-to-day basis. In the past we had to die to engage in a review of our lives, but now we can wake up earlier and eventually make death obsolete, as the Ninth Insight predicts.\" I finally understood . \"So this is what humans cam e to the Ear th to do, to systematically remember, to gradually awaken.\" \"That's right. We 're finally becom ing aware of a p rocess that has been unconscious since human experience began. From the start, humans have perceived a Bi rth Vision, and then after birth have gone unconscious, aware of only the vag uest of intuitions. At first, in the early days of human history, the distance between what we intended and what we act ually accom plished was very great, and then, over time, the distance has closed. Now we're on the verge of remembering everything.\" At that moment I was drawn back i nto the knowledge of the soul group. In"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"an instant my awareness seemed to increase another level, and all that Wil had said was con firmed. Now , finally, we cou ld look at history not as the blood y struggle of the human animal, who selfishly learned to dominate nature and to survive in greater style, pulling himself from life in the jungle to cr eate a vas t and com plex civilization. Rather, we cou ld look at human history as a spiritual process, as the deeper, systematic effort of souls, generation after generation, life after life, struggling through the millennia toward one solitary goal: to remember what we already knew in the Afterlife and to m ake this knowledge con scious on Ear th. As from a g reat height, a large holographic image opened up around me and I cou ld somehow see, in one glance, the long saga of human history. Without warning I was drawn into the image, and I felt myself being swept forward into the story, reliving it somehow in fast-forward, as if I had really been there, experiencing it moment by moment. Suddenly I was witnessing the dawn of con sciousness. Be fore me was a long, windswept plain, somewhere in Africa. Move ment cau ght my eye; a small group of humans, unclothed, was foraging on a field of berries. As I watched, I seemed to pick u p on the con sciousness of the period. Intimately con nected to the rhythms and signals of the natural world, we humans lived and responded instinctively. The routines of daily life were oriented toward the challenges of the search for food and toward membership within our individual band. Levels of power flowed downward from one physically stronger, attuned individual, and within this hierarchy we acce pted our place in the same way we acce pted the con stant tragedies and difficulties of existence: without reflection. As I watched, thousands of years passed by and cou ntless generations lived and perished. Then, slowly, certain individuals began to grow restless with the routines they saw before them. When a ch ild died in their arms, their con sciousness expanded and they began to as k why. And to wonder how it might be avoi ded in the future. These individuals were beginning to gain seV-aw areness-beginning to realize that they were here, now, alive. They were able to step back from their automatic responses and glimpse the full scope of existence. Life, they knew, endured through the cycles of the sun and moon and seasons, but as the dead around them attested, it also had an end. Wh at was the purpose? Looki ng closely at these reflective individuals, I realized I cou ld perceive their Birth Visions; they had com e into the Ear thly dimension with the specific purpose of initiating humanity's first existential awakening. And, even though I cou ldn't see its full scop e, I knew that in the back of their minds was held the larger inspiration of the Wor ld Vision. Be fore their birth, they were aware that humanity was embarking on a long journey that they cou ld already see. Bu t they also kn ew that progress along this journey would have to be earned, generation by generation-for as we awakened to pursue a h igher destiny, we also lost the cal m peace of unconsciousness. Along with the exhilaration and freedom of knowing we were alive cam e the fear and uncertainty of being alive without knowing why. I cou ld see that humanity's long history would be moved by these two conflicting urges. O n the one hand, we would be moved past our fears by the strength of our intuitions, by our mental images that life was about accom plishing some particular goal, of moving culture forward in a positive direction that only we, as individuals, act ing with cou rage and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"wisdom, cou ld inspire. From the strength of these feelings we would be reminded that, as insecure as life appeared, we were, in fact, not alone, that there was purpose and meaning underlying the mystery of existence. Yet, on the other hand, we would often fall prey to the opposite urge, the urge to protect ourselves from the Fear, at times losing sight of the purpose, falling into the angst of separation and abandonment. This Fear would lead us into a f rightened selfprotection, fighting to retain our positions of power, stealing energy from each other, and always resisting change and evolution, regardless of what new, better information might be avai lable. As the awakening con tinued, millennia passed, and I watched as humans gradually began to coal esce into ever-larger groups, following a n atural drive to identify with more people, to m ove into m ore com plex social organizations. I cou ld see that this drive cam e from the vag ue intuition, known fully in the Afterlife, that human destiny on Ear th was to evolve toward unification. Following this intuition, we realized that we cou ld evolve beyond the nomadic life of gathering and hunting and begin to cu ltivate the Ear th's plants and harvest them on a regular basis. Similarly we cou ld domesticate and breed many of the animals around us, ensuring a con stant presence of protein and related products. With the images of the Wor ld Vision deep within our unconscious, driving us archetypically, we began to envision a shift that would be one of the most dramatic transformations in human A history: the leap from nomadic wandering to the establishment of large farming villages. As these farming com munities grew more com plex, surpluses of food prompted trade and allowed humanity to divide into the first occu pational groups-shepherds and builders and weavers, then merchants and metalworkers and soldiers. Q uickly cam e the invention of writing and tabulation. Bu t the whims of nature and the challenges of life still pierced the awareness of early humanity, and the unspoke n question still loom ed: why were we alive? As before, I watched the Birth Visions of those individuals who sought to understand spiritual reality at a higher level. They cam e into the Ear th dimension to specifically expand human awareness of the divine source, but their first intuitions of the divine remained dim and incom plete, taking polytheistic form. Humanity began to ackn owledge what we supposed was a m ultitude of cruel and demanding deities, gods that existed outside of ourselves and ruled the weather, the seasons, and the stages of the harvest. In our insecurity we thought that we must appease these gods with rites and rituals and sacrifice. Over thousands of years the multitude of farming com munities coal esced further into large civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, Crete, and northern China, each inventing its own version of the nature and animal gods. Bu t such deities cou ld not long forestall the anxiety. I watched generations of sous com e into t e Ear t y imension inten ing to ring a m essage that humanity was destined to progress by sharing and com paring knowledge. Yet, once here, these individuals succumbed to the Fear and distorted this intuition into an unconscious need to con quer and dominate and impose their way of life on others by"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"force. So began the great era of the empires and tyrants, as one great leader rose up after another, uniting the strength of his people, conquering as much land as possible, con vinced that the views of his culture should be adopted by all. Yet, throughout this era, these many tyrants were always, in turn, con quered themselves and pressed under the yoke of a larger, stronger cultural view. For thousands of years different empires bubbled up to the top of humanity's con sciousness, disseminating their ideas, rising for a time with a m ore effective reality, economic plan, and war technology, only to be later deposed by a stronger and more organized vision. Eve r so slowly, through this method old, outdated ideas were replaced. I cou ld see that, as slow and blood y as this process was, key truths were gradually making their way from the Afterlife into the physical dimension. O ne of the most important of these truths-a n ew ethic of interaction-began to surface in var ious places around the globe, but ultimately found clear expression in the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. Instantly I cou ld see the Birth Visions of hundreds of individuals born into the Greek cu lture, each hoping to remember this timely insight. For generations they had seen the waste and injustice of mankind's unending violence upon itself, and knew that humans cou ld transcend the habit of fighting and con quering others and implement a n ew system for the exchange and com parison of ideas, a system that protected the sovereign right of every individual to hold his unique view, regardless of physical strengths system that was already known and followed in the Afterlife. As I watched, this new way of interaction began to emerge and take form on Ear th, finally becom ing known as democracy. in this method of exchanging ideas, com munication between humans still often degenerated into an insecure power struggle, but at least now, for the first time ever, the process was in place to pursue the evolution of human reality at the verbal rather than the physical level. At the same time, another watershed idea, one destined to com pletely transform the human understanding of spiritual reality, was surfacing in the written histories of a small tribe in the Middle Eas t. Similarly I could also see the Birth Visions of many of the proponents of this idea as well. These individuals, born into the Judaic cu lture, knew before birth that while we were cor rect to intuit a d ivine source, our description of this source was flawed and distorted. O ur con cept of many gods was merely a fragmented picture of a larger whole. In truth, they realized, there was only one God, a G od, in their view, that was still demanding and threatening and patriarchal-and still existing outside of ourselves-but for the first time, personal and responsive, and the sole creator of all humans. As I con tinued to watch, I saw this intuition of one divine source emerging and being clarified in cultures all ove r the world. In China and India, long the leaders in technology, trade, and social development, Hinduism and Buddhism, along with other Eas tern religions, moved the Eas t toward a m ore con templative focus. Those who cr eated these religions intuited that God was more than a personage. G od was a force, a con sciousness, that cou ld only be"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"com pletely found by attaining what they described as an enlightenment experience. Rather than just pleasing God by obeying certain laws or rituals, the Eas tern religions sought con nection with God on the inside, as a shift in awareness, an opening up of one's con sciousness to a harmony and security that was con stantly avai lable. Quickly my view shifted to the Sea of Galilee, and I cou ld see that the idea of one God that would ultimately transform We stern cultures was evolring from the notion of a d eity outside of us, patriarchical and judging, toward the position held in the Eas t, toward the idea A an inner God, a G od whose kingdom lay within. I watched as Sne person cam e into the Ear th dimension remembering almost 11 of his Birth Vision. He knew he was ere to bring a n ew energy into the world, a n ew culture based cin love. H is message was this: the one God was a h oly spirit, a d vine energy, whose existence cou ld be felt and proven experientially. Coming into spiritual awareness meant more than rit-L als and sacrifices and public prayer. It involved a repentance f a d eeper kind; a repentance that was an inner psychological shift based on the suspension of the ego's addictions, and a trarscendent \"letting go,\" which would ensure the true fruits of the spiritual life. As this message b gan to spread, I watched as one of the most influential of all empires, the Roman, embraced the new religion and spread the idea f the one, inner God throughout much of Europe. Later, when the barbarians struck f rom the north, dismembering the empire, the idea survived in the feudal organization of Christendom i hat followed. At this point I sa1v ag ain the appeals of the Gnostics, urging the church to focus rriore fully on the inner, transformative experience, using Christ's life as an example of what each of us might ach ieve. I saw the church lapse into the Fear, its leaders sensing a loss of control, buiding doctrine around the powerful hierarchy of the churchmer, who m ade themselves mediators, dispensers of the spirit to tlie populace. Eve ntually all texts related to Gnosticism were deemed blasphemous and excluded from the Bible. Even though may individuals cam e from the Afterlife dimension intending to broad en and democratize the new religion, it was a time of great fear, and efforts to reach out to ot her cultures were distorted again into the need to dominate and con trol. Here I saw the secret sects of the Franciscans again, who sought to include a reverence for nature and a return to the inner experience of the divine. These individuals had com e into the Ear th dimension intuiting that the Gnostic con tradiction would eventually be resolved, and were determined to preserve the old texts and manuscripts until that time. Again I saw my ill-fated attempt to m ake the information public too s oon , and my untimely departure. Yet I cou ld see clearly that a n ew era was unfolding in the We st. The power of the church was being challenged by another social unit: the nation-state. As more of the Ear th's peoples were becom ing con scious of each other, the era of the great empires was com ing to a cl ose. Ne w generations arrived able to intuit our destiny of unification, working"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"to promote a con sciousness of national origin based on com mon languages and tied more closely to on e sovereign area of land. These states were still dominated by autocratic leaders, often thought of as ruling by divine right, but a n ew human civilization was unfolding, one with recognized borders and established currencies and trade routes. Finally, in Europe, as wealth and literacy spread, a w ide renaissance began. As I watched, the Birth Visions of many of the participants cam e into m y view. They knew that human destiny was to develop an empowered democracy, and they cam e hoping to bring it into being. The writings of the Greeks and Romans were discove red, stimulating their memories. The first democratic parliaments were established, and cal ls were issued for an end to the divine right of kings and the blood y reign of the church over spiritual and social reality. Soon cam e the Protestant Reformation, which held the promise that individuals cou ld go directly to important Scriptures and con ceive a d irect con nection to the divine. At the same time, individuals seeking greater empowerment and freedom were exploring the American con tinent, a landmass symbolically lying between the cultures of the Eas t and the We st. As I watched the Birth Visions of the Europeans most inspired to enter this new world, I cou ld see that they cam e knowing that this land was already inhabited, aware that com munication and immigration should be undertaken only by invitation. Deep inside, they knew that the Americans were to be the grounding, the road back, for a Eu rope quickly losing its sense of sacred intimacy with the natural environment and moving toward a d angerous secularism. The Nat ive American cultures, while not perfect, provided a m odel from which the European mentality could regain its roots. Yet, again because of the Fear, these individuals were able to intuit only the drive to m ove to this land, sensing a n ew freedom and liberty of spirit, but bringing with them the need to dominate and con quer, and to pursue their own security. The important truths of the Nat ive cultures were lost in the rush to exploit the region's vas t natural resources. Meanwhile, in Europe, the Renaissance con tinued, and I began to see the full scop e of the Second Insight. The power of the church to define reality was diminishing, and Europeans were feeling as though they were awakening to look at life anew. Through the cou rage of cou ntless individuals, all inspired by their intuitive memories, the scientific m ethod was embraced as a d emocratic process of exploring and com ing to understand the world n which humans found themselves. This methodexploring some aspect of the natural world, drawing con clusions, then offering this view to ot hers-was thought of as the consensus-building process through which we would be able, finally, to understand mankind's real situation on this planet, including our spiritual nature. But those in the church, entrenched in Fear, sought to squelch this new science. As political forces lined up on both sides, a com promise was reached. Science would be free to explore the outer, material world, but must leave spiritual phenomena to the dictates of the still-influential churchmen. The entire inner world of experience-our higher perceptual states of beauty and love, intuitions, coi ncidences,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"interpersonal phenomena, even dreams-all were, at first, off limits to the new science. Despite these restrictions, science began to m ap out and describe the operation of the physical world, providing information rich in ways to increase trade and utilize natural resources. Human economic security increased, and slowly we began to lose our sense of mystery and our heartfelt questions about the purpose of life. We decided it was purposeful enough just to survive and build a b etter, more secure world for ourselves and our children. G radually we entered the con sensus trance that denied the reality of death and created the illusion that the world was explained and ordinary and devoid of mystery. In spite of our rhetoric, our once-strong intuition of a spiritual source was being pushed farther into the backg round. In this growing materialism, God cou ld only be viewed as a d istant Deist's God, a G od who m erely pushed the universe into being and then stood back t o let it run in a m echanical sense, like a p redictable machine, with every effect having a cau se, and unconnected events happening only at random, by chance alone. Yet here I cou ld see the birth intent of many of the individuals of this time period. They cam e knowing that the development of technology and production was important because it cou ld eventually be made nonpolluting and sustainable and cou ld liberate humankind beyond all imagination. Bu t in the beginning, born into the milieu of the time, all they cou ld remember was the general intuition to build and produce and work, holding Lightly to the democratic ideal. The vision shifted, and I cou ld see that nowhere was this intuition stronger than in the creation of the United States, with its democratic Constitution and its system of checks and balances. As a g rand experiment, America w as set up for the rapid exchange of ideas that was to ch aracterize the future. Yet below the surface, the messages of the Native Americans, and the Nat ive Africans, and other peoples on whose back t he American experiment was initiated, all cried out to be heard, to be integrated into the European mentality. By the nineteenth century we were on the verge of a second great transformation of human culture, a transformation that would be built on the new energy sources of oil and steam and finally electricity. The human economy had developed into a vas t and com plicated field of endeavor that supplied more products than ever before through an explosion of new techniques. In great numbers people were moving from rural com munities to great urban centers of production, shifting from life on the farm to involvement in the new, specialized industrial revolution. At the time, most believed that a d emocratically founded cap italism, unfettered by government regulation, was the desired method of human com merce. Yet, again, as I picked up on individual Birth Visions, I could see that most people born into this period had com e hoping to evolve cap italism toward a m ore perfect form. Un fortunately the level of Fear was such that all they managed to intuit was a d esire to build individual security, to exploit other workers, and to m aximize profits at every turn, often entering into col lusive agreements with com petitors and with governments. This was the great era of the robber barons and of secret"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"banking and industrial car tels. However, by the early twentieth century, because of the abuses of this freewheeling cap italism, two ot her economic systems were set to be offered as alternatives. Ear lier, in England, two m en had posed an alternative \"manifesto\" which cal led for a n ew system, run by workers, that would eventually create an economic utopia, where the resources of the whole of humanity would be made avai lable to each person accor ding to his needs, without greed or com petition. In the horrible working con ditions of the day, the idea at tracted many supporters. Bu t I quickly saw that this materialistic workers' \"manifesto\" had been a cor ruption of the original intention. Wh en the Birth Visions of the two m en cam e into vi ew, I realized that what they were intuiting was that human destiny was eventually to ach ieve such a utopia. Un fortunately they failed to remember that this utopia cou ld only be accom plished through democratic participation, born of free will and slowly evolved. Consequently the initiators of this com munist system, from the first revolution in Russia, erroneously thought that this system cou ld be created through force and dictatorship, an approach that failed miserably and cos t millions of lives. In their impatience the individuals involved had envisioned a u topia but had created com munism and decades of tragedy. The scene shifted to the other alternative to a d emocratic cap italism: the evil of fascism. This system was designed to enhance the profits and con trol of a ruling elite, who thought of themselves as privileged leaders of human society. They believed that only through the abandonment of democracy, and the union of government with the neW industrial leadership, cou ld a n ation reach its greatest potential and position in the world. I saw clearly that in Creating such a system, the participants were almost totally unconscious of their Birth Visions. They had com e here wishing only to promote the idea that civilization was evolving toward perfectibility and that a n ation of people, totally unified in purpose and will, striving to at tain their fullest potential, cou ld reach great heights of energy and effectiveness. Wh at was created was a fearfiAl, self-serving vision wrongly claiming the superiority of certain races and nations, and the possibility of developing a supernatior, whose destiny was to rule the world. Again the intuition that all humans were evolving toward perfection was distorted by weak, fearful men into the murderous reign of the Third Reich. I watched as others-who had likewise envisioned the perfectibility of mankind, biut who were in greater touch with the importance of an empowered democracy-intuited that they must stand up against both alternatives to a f reely expressed economy. The first stand resulted in a blood y world war against the fascist distortion, when finally at extreme cos t. The second resulted in a long and bitter col d war against the com munist bloc. I suddenly found myself focusing on the United States during the early years of this col d war, the decade of the fifties. At this time, America s tood successfully at the apex of what had been a four-hundred-year preoccu pation with secular materialism. Affluence and security had spread to include a large and growing middle class, and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"into this material success was born an enormous new generation, a Peneration whose intuitions would help lead humanity toward a t1hird great transformation. This generation grew up con stantly reminded that they lived in the greatest cou ntry in the world, the land of the free, with liberty and justice for all its citizens. Yet, as they matured, members of this generation found a d isturbing disparity between this popular American self-image and act ual reality. They found that many people in this land-women and certain racial minorities-were, by law and custom, definitely notfree. By the sixties the new generation was inspecting closely, and many were finding other disturbing aspects of the United States' self-image-for instance, a b lind patriotism that expected young people to go into a f oreign land to fight a p olitical war that had no clearly expressed purpose and no prospect of victory. just as disturbing was the culture's spiritual practice. The materialism of the previous four hundred years had pushed the mystery of life, and death, far into the backg round. Man y found the churches and synagogues full of pompous and meaningless ritual. Attendance seemed more social than spiritual, and the members too r estricted by a sense of how they might be perceived and judged by their onlooki ng peers. As the vision progressed, I cou ld tell that the new generation's tendency to an alyze and judge arose from a d eep-seated intuition that there was more to life than the old material reality took i nto accou nt. The new generation sensed new spiritual meaning just beyond the horizon, and they began to explore other, lesser known religions and spiritual points of view. For the first time the Eas tern religions were understood in great numbers, serving to val idate the mass intuition that spiritual perception was an inner experience, a shift in awareness that changed forever one's sense of identity and purpose. Similarly the Jewish Cabalist writings and the We stern Christian mystics, such as Meister Ecke hart and Teilhard de Chardin, provided other intriguing descriptions of a d eeper spirituality. At the same time, information was surfacing from the human sciences-sociology, psychiatry, psychology, and anthropology-as well as from modern physics, that cas t new light on the nature of human consciousness and creativity. This cumulation of thought, together with the perspective provided by the Eas t, gradually began to cr ystallize into what was later cal led the Human Potential Move ment, the emerging belief that human beings were presently act ualizing only a small portion of their vas t physical, psychological, and spiritual potential. I watched as, ove r the cou rse of several decades, this information and the spiritual experience it spawned grew into a cr itical mass of awareness, a leap in con sciousness from which we began to formulate a new view of what living a h uman life was all about, including, ultimately, an act ual remembrance of the Nine insights. Yet, even as this new view was crystallizing, surging through the human world as a con tagion of con sciousness, many others in the new generation began to pull back, suddenly alarmed at the growing instability in culture which seemed to cor respond to the arrival of the new paradigm. For hundreds of years the solid agreements of the old worldview had maintained a w ell-defined, even rigid, order for human life. All roles were clearly defined, and everyone knew his place: for instance, men at work, women and children at home, nuclear and genetic families intact, a ubiquitous work ethic. C itizens were expected to discove r a p lace in the economy, to find meaning in family and children, and to kn ow that"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"the purpose of life was to live well and create a m ore materially secure world for the succeeding generation. Then cam e the sixties wave of questioning and analysis and criticism, and the unwavering rules began to cr umble. No l onger was behavior effectively governed by powerful agreements. Everyone now seemed empowered, liberated, free to) ch art his or her own course in life, to reach out for this nebulous idea of potential. In this climate what others thought ceased to be the -i real determinant of our act ion and con duct; increasingly our behavior was being determined by how we felt inside, by our own inner ethics. For those who had truly adopted a m ore lived, srpiritual point of view, characterized by honesty and love toward opthers, ethical behavior was not a p roblem. Bu t of con cern were thiose who had lost the outer guidelines for living, without yet forrming a strong inner cod e. They seemed to be falling into a cu lturral no-m an'sland, where now anything seemed to be permissiblle: crime and drugs and addictive impulses of all kinds, not to m iention a loss of the work ethic. T o m ake matters worse, many sseemed to be using the new findings of the Human Potential Wove ment to imply that criminals and deviates weren't really evein responsible for their own act ions, but were, instead, victims of can oppressive culture that shamelessly allowed the social cor nditions that shaped this behavior. As I con tinued to watch, I understood what I was seeing: a p olarization of viewpoint was quickly forming arouind the planet, as those who were undecided now reacted against a cu ltural viewpoint they saw leading to runaway chaos ancd uncertainty, Perhaps even to the total disintegration of their ,AvaY of life. In the United States especially, a g rowing number off people were becom ing con vinced they were now facing what amounted to a l ife-and-death struggle against the permissiveness Bon d liberalism of the past twenty-five years-a cu lture war, as thtey cal led itwith nothing short of the survival of We stern civilizration at stake. I cou ld see that many of them even con sidered the cau se already near lost, and thus advocat ed extreme act ion. In the face of this backl ash, I cou ld see the advocat es of Human Potential moving into fear and defensiveness themselves, sensing that many hard-earned victories for individual rights and social com passion were now in danger of being swept away by a tide of con servatism. Man y considered this reaction against liberation an attack b y the embattled forces of greed and exploitation, who were pushing forth in one last attempt to dominate the weaker members of society. Here I cou ld clearly see what was intensifying the polarization: each side was thinking the other to be a con spiracy of evil. The advocat es of the old worldview were no longer con sidering the Human Potentialists as misguided or naive, but were, in fact, con sidering them to be part of a larger con spiracy of big government socialists, holdout adherents of the com munist solution, who were seeking to accom plish exactly what was occu rring: the erosion of cultural life to the point where an allpowerful government cou ld com e in and straighten everything"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"out. in their view this con spiracy was using fear of increasing crime as an excuse to register guns and systematically disarm the public, giving ever-greater con trol to a ce ntralized bureaucracy that would finally monitor the movement of cas h and credit car ds through uplinks into the Internet, rationalizing the growing con trol of the electronic economy as crime prevention, or as a n ecessity to col lect taxes or prevent sabotage. Finally, perhaps under the ploy of an impending natural disaster, big brother would step forward and con fiscate wealth and declare martial law. For the advocat es of liberation and change, just the opposite scenario seemed more likely. In the face of the con servatives'pohtical gains, all that they had worked for seemed to be crashing before their eyes. They, too, observed the increasing violent crime and the degenerating family structures, only for them the cau se was not too m uch government intervention, but too l ittle, too l ate. In every nation cap italism had failed a w hole class of people, and the reason was clear: for poor people there existed no op portunity to participate in the system. Ef fective education wasn't there. The jobs weren't there. And instead of helping, the government seemed ready to back aw ay, throwing out the antipoverty programs with all the other hard-won social gains of the last twenty-five years. I cou ld see clearly that, in their growing disillusionment, the reformers were beginning to believe the worst: that the rightward swing in human society cou ld only be the result of increased manipulation and control by the moneyed, cor porate interests in the world. These interests seemed to be buying governments, buying the media, and ultimately, as in Nazi Germany, they would slowly divide the world into the haves and the have-nots, with the largest, richest cor porations running the small entrepreneurs out of business and con trolling more and more of the wealth. Sure there would be riots, but that would just play into the hands of the elite as they strengthened their police con trol. My awareness suddenly jumped to a h igher level and I finally understood the polarization of Fear com pletely: great numbers of people seemed to be gravitating to on e perspective or the other, with both sides raising the stakes to that of war, of good vs. evil, and both visualizing the other as the perpetrators of a g rand con spiracy. And in the backg round I now understood the growing influence of those people who cl aimed to be able to explain this emergent evil. These were the end-times analysts to whom Joel had I referred earlier. In the growing turmoil of the transition, these I interpreters were beginning to increase their power. In their view the Bible's prophecies were to be understood literally, and what they saw in the uncertainty of our time was the long-aw aited apocal ypse preparing to descend. Soon would com e the outright holy war in which humans would be divided between the forces of darkness and armies of light. They envisioned this war as a real physical con flict, fast and blood y, and for those who kn ew it was com ing, only one decision was important: be on the cor rect side when the fighting began."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Yet simultaneously, just as with the other landmark turns in human history, I cou ld see beyond the Fear and retrenchment to the act ual Birth Visions of those involved. Clearly everyone on both sides of the polarization had com e into the physical dimension intending that this polarization not be so intense. We wanted a smooth transition from the old materialistic worldview to the new spiritual one, and we wanted a transformation in which the best of the older traditions would be recognized and integrated into the new world that was emerging. I cou ld clearly see that this growing belligerence was an aberration, com ing not from intention, but from the Fear. O ur original vision was that the ethics of human society would be maintained at the same time that each person cou ld be fully liberated and the environment protected; and that economic cr eativity would be at once con served and transformed by introducing an ove rriding spiritual purpose. And further, that this spiritual purpose cou ld descend fully into the world and initiate a utopia in a w ay that symbolically fulfilled the end-times Scriptures. watched May a's Birth Vision, I cou ld almost glimpse this higher My awareness am plified even further, and just as when I had spiritual understanding, the full picture of where human history was intended to go from here, how we cou ld ach ieve this reconciliation of views and go on to fulfill our human destiny. Then, as before, my head began to spin, and I lost con centration; I cou ldn't reach the level of energy needed to grasp it. The vision began to disappear, and I strained to hold on, seeing the current situation one last time. Clearly, without the mediating influence of the Wor ld Vision, the polarization of Fear would con tinue to acce lerate. I cou ld see the two sides hardening, their feelings intensifying, as both began to think the other to be not just wrong, but hideous, venal ... i n league with the devil himself. After a m oment of dizziness and a sense of rapid movement, I looke d around and saw Wil beside me. H e glanced my way, then gazed out at the dark gray environment, a con cerned expression n his face. We had traveled to a n ew locat ion. Were you able to see my vision of history?\" I asked. He looke d at me again and nodded. \"What we just saw was a n ew spiritual interpretation of history, somewhat specific to your cultural view, but amazingly revealing. I've never seen anything ike that before. This has to be part of the Tenth-a cl ear view of the human quest as seen in the Afterlife.

And, ultimately, they must bear the full responsibility of these mistakes. But what has to be understood is that horrible act s are cau sed, in part, by our very tendency to as sume that some people are naturally evil. That's the mistaken view that fuels the polarization. Bot h sides can 't believe humans can act the way they do without being intrinsically no good , and so they increasingly dehumanize and alienate each other, which increases the Fear and brings out the worst in everyone.\" He seemed distracted again, looki ng away. \"Each side thinks the other is involved in a con spiracy of the greatest sort,\" he added, \"the embodiment of all that's negative.\" I noticed he was looki ng out toward the distance again, and when I followed his eyes, and also focused on the environment, I began to pick up an om inous sense of darkness and foreboding. \"I think,,, he con tinued, \"that we can 't bring in the Wor ld Vision, or resolve the polarization, until we understand the real nature of evil and the act ual reality of Hell.\" \"Why do you say that?\" I asked. He glanced at me one more time, then gazed out again into the dull gray. \"Because Hell is exactly where we are.\" AN INNER HELL Achill surged through my body as I looke d out on the gray environment.

I was suddenly pulled into an intense blackn ess and then beyond it into a l arge town of some kind. In terror r I I looke d around, struggling to ke ep my wits, and realized that the architecture indicated the nineteenth century. I was standing on a street cor ner full of people walking by, and in the distance was the raised dome of a cap itol building. At first I thought I was act ually in the nineteenth century, but several aspcts of the reality were wrong: the horizon faded out to a s trange gray col or, and the sky was olive green, similar to the sky above the office con struction that Williams had created when he was avoi ding the realization that he had died. Then I becam e aware of four men watching rre from the opposite street corner. An icy-col d feeling swept my body. All were well dressed and one cocke d his head and took a p uff from a large cigar. Another checked a watch and returned it to his vest pocke t. Their look w as sophisticated but menaciN. \"Anyone who has raised their ire is a friend J mine,\" a low voi ce spoke from behind me. I turned to see a large, barrel-shaped man, also well dressed and wearing a w ide-brimmed felt hat, walking toward me. H is face seemed familiar; I had seen him before. Bu t where? \"Don't mind them,\" he added. \"They're not so hard to ou tsmart.\" I stared at his tall, stoop ed posture and shifitng eyes, then remembered who he was. H e had been the com mander of the federal troop s I had seen in the visions of the nineteenth-century war, the one who had refused to see May a an d had ordered the battle against the Nat ive people to begin. This to,,vn was a con struction, I thought. H e must have re-created his later life situation in order to avoi d realizing he was dead. \"This is not real,\" I blurted. \"You're ... u h ... d eceased.\" He seemed to ignore my statement. \"So what have you done to piss off that bunch of jackal s?\" \"I haven't done anything.\" \"Oh yes, you've done something. I know that look t hey're giving you. They think they run this town, you know. In fact, they think they can run the whole world.\" He shook h is head. \"These people never trust fate. They think they're responsible for seeing that the future turns out exactly as they plan. Eve rything. Econ omic development, governments, the flow of money, even the relative value of world currencies. All of which is not a b ad idea, really. G od knows the world is full of peons and idiots, who will ruin everything if left to their own devices. The people have to be herded and con trolled as much as possible, and if one can make a little money along the way, why not? \"But these nuts tried to run me. O f cou rse, I'm too s mart for them."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"I've always been too s mart for them. So what did you do?\" \"Listen,\" I said. \"Try to understand. Non e of this is real.\" \"Hey,\" he replied, \"I would suggest that you take me into your confidence. If they're against you. I'm the only friend you have.\" I looke d away, but I cou ld tell he was still eyeing me suspiCiously. \"They're treacherous people,\" he went on. \"They'll never forgive you. Take my situation, for example. All they wanted was to use my military experience to quash the Indians and open up their lands. Bu t I was onto them. I knew they cou ldn't be trusted, that I would have to look ou t for myself.\" He gave me a w ry look. \"It's harder for them to use you and throw you away if you're a w ar hero, right? After the war I sold myself to the public. T hat way, these characters had to play ball with me. Bu t let me tell you: never underestimate these people. They are cap able of anything!\" He backe d away from me a m oment, as if pondering my appearance. \"In fact,\" he added, \"they may have sent you as a spy.\" At a loss as to what to do, I started to walk aw ay. \"You bastard!\" he yelled. \"I was right.\" I saw him reach into a p ocke t and pull a short knife. Petrified, I forced my body to m ove, running down the street and into an alleyway, his footsteps heavy behind me. O n the right was a d oor, partially open. I ran through it and slid the bolt into the locke d position. My next breath drew in the heavy odor of opium. Around me were dozens of people, their faces staring absently up at me. Were they real, I wondered, or part of the con structed illusion? Mos t quickly turned back t o their muted con versation and hookah pipes, so I started to walk through the dirty mattresses and sofas to an other door. \"I know you,\" a w oman slurred. She was leaning against the wall by the door, her head hanging forward as if too h eavy for her neck. \" I went to your school.\" I looke d at her in con fusion for a m oment, then remembered the young girl in my high school who had suffered from repeated episodes of depression and drug use. Resisting all intervention, she had finally overdosed and died. \"Sharon, is that you?\" She managed a smile, and I glanced back at the door, con cerned that the knife-bearing com mander might have found a w ay inside. \"It's okay ,\" she said. \"You can stay here with us. You'll be safe in this room . Not hing can hurt you.\" I walked a step closer and as gently as possible said, \"I don't want to stay. All this is an illusion.\" As I said that, three or four people turned and looke d at me angrily. \"Please, Sharon,\" I whispered. \"Just com e with me.\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Two of the closest stood up and walked ove r beside Sharon. \"Get out of here,\" one told me. \"Leave her alone.\" \"Don't listen to him,\" the other said to Sharon. \"He's crazyWe need each other.\" I stoop ed slightly so I cou ld look d irectly into Sharon's eyes. \"Sharon, none of this is real. You're dead. We have to find a w ay out of here.\" \"Shut up!\" another person screamed. Four or five more people walked toward me, hate in their eyes. \"Leave us alone.\" I began to back t oward the door; the crowd moved toward me. Through the bodies I cou ld see Sharon turning back t o her hookah hose. I turned and ran through the door, only to realize that I wasn't outside. I was in an office of some kind, surrounded by com puters, filing cab inets, a conference table-modern, twentieth-century furniture and equipment. \"Hey, you're not supposed to be in here,\" someone said. I turned around to see a m iddle-aged man looki ng at me ove r his reading glasses. \"Where's my secretary? I don't have time for this. What do you want?\" \"Someone's chasing me. I was trying to hide.\" \"Good God, man! Then don't com e in here. I said I don't have time for this. You haven't the slightest idea what I have to do today. Look at these cas e files. Wh o do you think will process them if I don't?\" I thought I saw a look of terror on his face. I shook m y head and looke d for another door. \"Don't you know you're dead?\" I asked. \"This is all imagined.\" He paused, the look of terror shifting to an ger, then asked, \"How did you get in here? Are you a cr iminal?\" I found a d oor that led outside and ran out. The streets were now com pletely empty except for one car riage. It pulled up to the hotel across from me, and a b eautiful woman, dressed in evening attire, got out and glanced ove r toward me, then smiled. There was something warm and car ing about her demeanor. I dashed acr oss the street toward her, and she paused to watch me approach , her smile coy and inviting. \"You're alone,\" she said. \"Why don't you join me?\" \"Where are you going?\" I asked tentatively. \"To a p arty.\" \"Who's going to be there?\" \"I have no idea.\" She opened the door to the hotel and motioned for me to com e with her. I"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"followed aimlessly, trying to think of what to do. We walked into the elevator and she pushed the button for the fourth floor. As we rode up, the sensation of warmth and car ing increased with each floor. O ut of the cor ner of my eye I saw her staring at my hands. Wh en I looke d, she smiled again and pretended to have been cau ght. The elevator opened and she led me down the hall to a p articular door and knocke d twice. After a m oment the door was unlocke d and a m an opened it. H is face lit up at the sight of the woman. \"Come in!\" he said. \"Come in!\" She invited me to enter ahead of her, and as I walked in, a y oung woman reached ove r and took m y arm. She was dressed in a strapless gown and was barefooted. \"Oh, you're lost,\" she said. \"Poor thing. You'll be safe in here with us.\" Past the door I cou ld see a m an without a shirt. \"Look at those thighs,\" he com mented, staring at me. \"He has perfect hands,\" another said. In a state of shock I realized the room was crowded with people in various stages of nudity and lovemaking. \"No, wait,\" I said. \"I can 't stay.\" The woman on my arm said, \"You would go back ou t there? it takes forever to find a g roup like this. Feel the energy in here. Not like the fear of being alone, huh?\" She moved her hand acr oss my chest. Suddenly there was the sound of a scuffle on the other side of the room . \"No, leave me alone!\" someone shouted. \"I don't want to be here.\" A young man no ol der than eighteen pushed several people away and ran out the door. I used t e istraction to run out behind him. Not waiting for the elevator, he bounded down the adjacent stairs and I followed. When I reached the street, he was already on the other side. I was about to shout for him to stop when I saw him freeze in terror. Ahead on the sidewalk was the com mander, still holding the knife, but this time facing the group of men who had watched me earlier. They were all talking at the same time, posturing angrily Abruptly one of the group pulled a g un, and the com mander rushed toward him with the knife. Shots rang out, and the com mander's hat and knife flew backw ard as the bullet pierced his forehead. H e dropped to the ground with a thud, and as he did, the other men stopped in midmotion and began to fade away until they disappeared com pletely. Just as quickly the man on the ground also disappeared. Across from me, the young man sat wearily down on the curb and put his head in his hands. I rushed up to him, my knees shaking. \"It's okay ,\" I said. \"They're gone.\" \"No, they're not,\" he said in frustration. \"Look ove r there.\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"I turned and saw the four men who had disappeared standing across the street in front of the hotel. Un believably they were in the exact position they had been in when I had first seen them. One puffed his cigar and the other checked his watch. My heart skipped a b eat as I also spotted the com mander, standing acr oss from them again, staring menacingly. \"This keeps happening ove r and ove r,\" the young man said. \"I can 't stand this anymore. Someone's got to help me.\" Before I cou ld say anything, two forms materialized to his right, but remained obscured, out of focus. The young man stared at the forms for a long time, then, with a look of excitement on his face, said, \"Roy, is that you?\" As I watched, the two forms moved toward him until he was com pletely hidden by their weaving shapes. After several minutes he had com pletely disappeared, along with the two souls. I stared at the empty curb where he had been sitting, feeling remnants of a h igher vibration. In my mind's eye I saw my soul group again and felt their deep car ing and love. Concentrating on the feeling, I was able to shake off the blanketing anxiety and to am plify my energy in increments until finally I began to op en up inside. Immediately the environment shifted to lighter shades of gray and the town disappeared. As my energy increased, I was able to image Wil's face, and instantly he was beside me. \"Are you okay ?\" he asked, turning to embrace me. H is expression showed immense relief. \"Those illusions were strong, and you willed yourself right into them.\" \"I know. I cou ldn't think, cou ldn't remember what to do.\" \"You were gone a long time, all we cou ld do was send you energy. \"Who do you mean by we?\" \"All these souls.\" Wil's hand gestured outwardly. When I looke d fully, I cou ld see hundreds of souls stretching as far as I cou ld see. Some were looki ng directly at us, but most appeared to be focused in another direction. I looke d to see where they were staring, following their gaze to several large swirls of energy far in the distance. Wh en I con centrated my focus, I realized that one of the swirls was in fact the town from which I had just escaped. \"What are those places?\" I asked Wil. \"Mental con structions,\" he replied, \"set up by souls who in life lived very restrictive con trol dramas and cou ld not wake up after death. Man y thousands of them exist out there.\" \"Were you able to see what was happening when I was in the construction?\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"\"Mos t of it. Wh en I focused on the souls nearby, I cou ld pick u p on their view of what was happening to you. This ring of souls is constantly beaming energy into the illusions, hoping someone will respond.\" \"Did you see the teenage boy? H e was able to wake up. Bu t the others didn't seem to pay attention to an ything.\" Wil turned to face me. \"Do you remember what we saw during Williams' Life Review? At first he cou ldn't acce pt what was happening, and he began to repress his death to the extent that he created a m ental construction of his office.\" \"Yes, I thought of that when I was down there.\" \"Well, that's how it works for everyone. If we die and we have been so immersed in our con trol drama an d routine as a w ay to repress the mystery and insecurity of life, to such a d egree that we can 't even wake up after death, then we create these illusions or trances so we can continue the same way of feeling safe, even after we enter the Afterlife. If Williams' soul group had not reached him, he would have entered one of the hellish places where you were. It's all a reaction to Fear. The people there would be paralyzed with Fear if they didn't find some way to ward it off, to repress it below con sciousness. Wh at they're doing is repeating the same dramas, the same cop ing devices, they practiced in life, and they can 't stop.\" \"So these illusional realities are just severe con trol dramas?\" \"Yes, they all fall within the general styles of the con trol dramas, except that they are more intense and nonreflective. For example, the man with the knife, the com mander, was no doubt an intimidator in the way he stole energy from others. And he rationalized this behavior by assuming that the world was out to get him, and of cou rse, in his life on Ear th these expectations drew just those kinds of people into his life, so his mental vision was fulfilled. H ere he just created imaginary people to be after him so he cou ld reproduce the same situation. \"If he were to run out of people to intimidate and his energy were to fall, anxiety would begin to seep into con sciousness again. So he has to ke ep up the intimidator role con stantly. H e has to ke ep this particular kind of act ion going, the act ion he learned long ago, the only act ion he knows that will preoccu py his mind sufficiently to ki ll the Fear. It is the act ion itself-the com pulsive, dramatic, high-adrenaline nature of the act ion-that pushes the anxiety so far into the backg round that he can forget about it, repress it, and feel half at ease in his existence, at least for a little while.\" \"What about the drug users?\" I asked. \"in this cas e, they were taking passivity, the 'poor me,' to the extreme of projecting nothing but despair and cruelty on the entire world, rationalizing a n eed to escape. O bsessively pursuing drugs still serves the function of preoccu pying the mind and repressing anxiety, even in the Afterlife. \"In the physical dimension drugs often produce a e uphoria"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"quite like the euphoria that com es from love. The problem with this false euphoria, however, is that the body resists the chemicals and counteracts them, which means that, as the drug is repeatedly used, it takes an increasingly larger dose to reach the same effect, which eventually destroys the body.\" I thought of the com mander again. \"Something really strange happened down there. The man who was chasing me was killed, and then he seemed to com e back t o life and start the drama al l over again.\" \"That's how it works in this self-imposed Hell. All these illusions always play out and blow up in the end. If you had been with someone who had repressed the mystery of life by eating great am ounts of fat, a heart attack m ight have ended it. The drug users eventually destroy their own bodies, the com mander dies ove r and ove r, and so on . \"And it works the same way in the physical dimension: a com pulsive control drama al ways fails, soon er or later. Us ually it happens during the trials and challenges of life; routines break d own and the anxiety rushes in. It is what's cal led hitting bottom. This is the time to wake up and handle the Fear in another way; but if a person can 't, then he or she goes right back i nto the trance. And if one doesn't wake up in the physical dimension, one might have difficulty waking up in the other as well. \"These com pulsive trances accou nt for all horrible behavior in the physical dimension. This is the psychology of all truly evil act s, the motivation behind the inconceivable behavior of child molesters, sadists, and serial monsters of all kinds. They're simply repeating the only behavior they know that will numb the mind and keep away the anxiety that com es from the lostriess they feel.\" \"So you're saying,\" I interjected, \"that there is no or ganized, conspiratorial evil in the world, no satanic plot to which we fall prey?\" \"Non e. There is only human fear and the bizarre ways that humans try to ward it off.\" \"What about the many references in sacred texts and scriptures to Satan?\" \"This idea is a m etaphor, a symbolic way of warning people to look t o the divine for security, not to their sometimes tragic ego urges and habits. Bl aming an outside force for everything bad was perhaps important at a ce rtain stage in human development. But now it obscures the truth, because blaming our behavior on forces outside ourselves is a w ay of avoi ding responsibility. And we tend to use the idea of Satan to project that some people are inherently evil so we can dehumanize the ones we disagree with and write them off. It is time now to understand the true nature of human evil in a m ore sophisticated way and then to deal with iC, \"If there is no satanic plot,\" I said, \"then 'possession' doesn't exist.\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"\"That's not so,\" Wil said emphatically. \"Psychological'possession' does exist. Bu t it is not the result of a con spiracy of evil; it is just energy dynamics. Fearful people want to con trol others. That's why certain groups try to pull you in and con vince you to follow them, and ask you to submit to their authority, or fight you if you try to leave.\" \"When I was first drawn into that illusory town, I thought I had been possessed by some demonic force.\" \"No, you were drawn in because you made the same mistake you made earlier: you didn't just open up and listen to those souls; you gave yourself ove r to them, as if they automatically had all the answers, without checking to see if they were con nected and motivated by love. And unlike the souls who ar e divinely con nected, they didn't back aw ay from you. They just pulled you into their world, the same way some crazy group or cult might do in the physical dimension if you don't discriminate. Wil paused as if in thought, then con tinued. \"All this is more of the Tenth insight; that's why we're seeing it. As com munication between the two dimensions increases, we'll begin to have more encounters with souls in the Afterlife. This part of the insight is that we must discern between those souls who ar e awake and con nected with the spirit of love and those who ar e fearful and stuck i n an obsessive trance of some kind. But we must do so without invalidating and dehumanizing those cau ght in such fear dramas by thinking they are demons or devils. They are souls in a g rowth process, just like us. In fact, in the Ear th dimension those who ar e now cau ght up in dramas from which they can 't escape are often the very souls who were the most optimistic in their Birth Visions.\" I shook m y head, not following his meaning. \"That is why,\" he con tinued, \"they chose to be born into such drastic, fearful situations that necessitate such intense, crazy cop ing devices.\" \"You're talking about com ing into ab usive and dysfunctional families, that sort of situation?\" \"Yes. Intense con trol dramas of all kinds, whether they are violent or just perverse and strange addictions, com e from environments where life is so ab usive and dysfunctional and con strictive, and the level of Fear is so great, that they spawn this same rage and anger or perversion ove r and ove r, generation after generation. The individuals who ar e born into these situations choose to do so on purpose, with clarity.\" The idea seemed preposterous to m e. w y would anyone want to be born into a p lace like that?\" \"Because they were sure they had enough ;trength to break ou t, to end the cycle, to heal the family system in which they would be born. They were con fident that they cou ld awaken and work through the resentment and anger at finding themselves in these deprived circumstances, and see it all as apreparation for a m ission-usually one of helping others out of dmilar situations. Even if they are violent, we have to see them as iaving the potential to break f ree of the drama.\""},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"\"Then the liberal perspective on crime anclAolence, the idea that everyone can change and be rehabilitates' is the desirable one. The conservative approach is without mert?\" Wil smiled. \"Not exactly. The liberals are right to see that people who have grown up in abusive and oppressive situations are a p roduct of their environments, and the Conservatives are out of touch to the extent they believe stoppinE a l ife of crime or public dole is just a m atter of making a con sciOLIS choice. \"But the liberal approach is superficial as \"ell, to the degree they believe people can change if offered different circumstances, better financial support, or education, for instarce. Us ually interverition programs focus only on helping othes to better their decision making and economic ch oices. In the cas e of violent offenders, rehabilitation attempts have always offered, at best, superficial cou nseling and, in the worst cas es excuses and leniency, which is precisely the wrong thing the do. Eve ry time someone with a d isturbed con trol drama is slarped on the hand, turned loose with no con sequences, it enable! the behavior to continue and reinforces the idea that this behavor is not serious, which just sets up the circumstances that guanntee it will occu r again.\" \"Then what can be done?\" I asked. Wil seemed to be vibrating with excitement. \"We can learn to intervene spiritually! And that means helping to bring the whole process into consciousness, as these souls here are doing for those cau ght in the illusions.\" Wil was staring at the souls in the ring, then looke d at me and shook his head. \"I can get all the information I've just relayed to you from these souls, but I still can 't see the Wor ld Vision clearly. We haven't learned how to build enough energy yet.\" I focused on the souls in the ring but cou ld get no information other than what Wil had con veyed. Clearly the soul groups held a g reater knowledge and were projecting this knowledge toward the fear constructions, but like Wil, I still cou ldn't quite understand anything more. \"At least we have another piece of the Tenth Insight,\" Wil said. \"We know that no m atter how undesirable the behavior of others is, we have to grasp that they are just souls attempting to wake up, like us.\" I was suddenly jolted backw ard by a b last of dissonant noise, images of whirling col ors seizing my mind. Wi l lunged forward and cau ght me at the last moment, pulling me into his energy and again holding me back firmly. For a m oment I seemed to shake violently and then the discord passed. \"They've started the experiment again,\" Wil said. I shook of f the dizziness and looke d at him. \"That means Curtis will probably try to use force to stop them. H e's con vinced that's the only way.\" As soon as I spoke those words, I saw a cl ear picture of Feyman in my mind, the man David Lone Eag le thought had something to do with the experiment. H e was somewhere ove rlooki ng the val ley. G lancing at Wil, I realized that he had seen the same image. H e nodded in agreement and we instantly began to m ove."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"When we stopped, Wil and I were facing each other. Around us was more gray. Another loud, disharmonious sound shattered the silence, and Wil's face began to lose focus. H e con tinued to hold onto m e, and after several moments the sound ended. \"These sound bursts are com ing more frequently now,\" Wil said. \"We may not have much time left.\" I nodded, fighting the dizziness. \"Let's look ar ound,\" Wil said. As soon as we focused on our surroundings, we saw what appeared to be a mass of energy several hundred yards away. Immediately it closed to within forty or fifty feet. \"Be car eful,\" Wil cau tioned. \"Don't identify com pletely with them. just listen and find out who they are.\" I focused warily, and immediately saw souls in motion and an image of the town from which I had escaped. I recoiled in fear, which act ually made them com e closer to us. \"Stay centered in love,\" Wil instructed. \"They can 't pull us in unless we act as though we want them to save us. Try to send them love and energy. It'll either help them or make them run away Realizing the souls were more afraid than I was, I found my center and beamed them love energy. Immediately they moved rapidly away from us to their original position. \"Why can 't they acce pt the love and wake up?\" I asked Wil. \"Because when they feel the energy and it raises their con sciousness a degree, their preoccu pation lifts somewhat and doesn't fend off the anxiety of their aloneness. Coming into aw areness and breaking free of a con trol drama al ways feels anxious at first, because the com pulsion has to lift before the inward solution to the lostness can be found. That's why a 'dark night of the soul' sometimes precedes increased awareness and spiritual euphoria.\" A movement to the right cau ght our attention. Wh en I focused, I realized that other souls were in the area; they cam e closer and the others moved away. I strained to pick u p on what the group was doing. \"Why do you think this group is here?\" I asked Wil. He shrugged. \"They have something to do with this guy Feyman.\" In the space around the group I began to see a m oving image, a scene of some kind. Wh en I brought it clearly into focus, I realized it was the image of an expansive industrial plant somewhere on Ear th, with large metal buildings and rows of what looke d like transformers and pipes and miles of interlinking wire. At the center of the com plex, atop one of the largest buildings, was a"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"com mand center of pure glass. Inside I cou ld see rows of com puters and gauges of all descriptions. I glanced at Wil. \"I see it,\" he said. As we con tinued to survey the com plex, our perspective expanded so that we cou ld now view the plant from above. From here we cou ld see miles of wire leaving the plant in all directions, feeding huge towers con taining some sort of laser beams shooting energy out to ot her local stations. \"Do you know what all this is?\" I asked Wil. He nodded. \"It's a ce ntralized energy-generating plant.\" Move ment at one end of the com plex attracted our attention. Emergency van s and fire trucks were arriving at one of the larger buildings. An om inous glow radiated from the third-floor windows. At one point the glow brightened and then the ground a an explosion of under the entire building seemed to cr ack . I then slowly col dust and debris the building shuddered and lapsed. To the right another building burst inO flames. The scene moved to the com mand center, Nvh ere inside, technicians moved frantically. From the right a d 3or opened and a m an entered with an arm full of charts and Ilueprints. H e laid them out on a table and worked with what apf eared to be determined con fidence. Wal king with a limp to on( side of the room , he began to ad just switches and dials. G raually the ground mder control. H e stopped shaking and the fires were brought con tinued to work hastily and to instruct the (,ther technicians. I looke d at the individual now in charge more closely and then turned to Wi l. \"That's Feyman!\" Before Wil cou ld respond, the scene shiftec into fast-forward. Before our eyes the plant was saved, then, quicdy, workers began to dismantle it, building by building. At the s-,me time, on a site nearby, a n ew, smaller facility was being con structed that would most of the cor nmanufacture more com pact generators. Finall) plex had been returned to its natural, wood ed state, and the new facility was turning out small units that we coj d see behind each house and business throughout the cou ntryside Abruptly our perspective backe d away quick. w e cou ld see a single individual in the foreground watching he same scene we were. Wh en we could see his profile, I realized that it was Feyman, before his current birth, con templatirg what he cou ld achieve in life. Wil and I looke d at each other. \"This is pirt of his Birth Vision, isn't it?\" I asked. Wil nodded. \"This must be his soul group. Let's see how much more we"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"can find out about him.\" We both focused on the group, and another image formed in front of us. It was the nineteenth-century war cam p; the headquarters tent again. We could see Feyman together with the com mander, the man I had seen again in the illusional town. Feyman was the other aide who had been there with Williams. H e was the one who limped. As we watched their interaction, we began to pick u p on the story of their association. A bright tactician, Feyman was in charge of strategy and technological developments. In advance of the attack t he com mander had ordered smallpox-laden blankets cove rtly traded to the Nat ive Americans, a tactic Feyman adamantly opposed, not so m uch because of its effect on the indigenous people as because he felt that it was politically indefensible. Afterward, even as the success of the battle was being hailed in Was hington, the press found out about the use of smallpox, and an investigation was launched. The com mander and his cronies in Was hington set Feyman up as the scapegoat and his car eer was ruined. Later the com mander set forth on a g lorious political car eer and national stature, before he was also treacherously double-crossed by the same Was hington insiders. Feyman, for his part, never recove red; his own political am bitions had been totally destroyed. O ver the years he becam e increasingly more embittered and resentful, trying desperately to m arshal public op inion to ch allenge his com mander's accou nt of the battle. For a w hile several journalists pursued the story, but soon public interest faded com pletely and Feyman remained in a state of disgrace. Later, toward the end of his life, he languished in the realization that his political goals would never be reached, and, blaming his old com mander for his humiliation, he at tempted to, assassinate the ex-politician at a state dinner and was shot dead by bodyguards. Because Feyman had cut himself off from his inner security and love, the could not fully awaken after death. For years he believed he had escaped his ill-fated attempt to ki ll his old com mander, and had lived in illusional con structions, holding on to his hate anA doom ed to the repeated horror of planning and attempting another assassination, only to be shot, ove r and ove r. As I watched, I realized that Feyman cou ld have been trapped in the illusiions for a m uch longer period of time had it not been for the determined efforts of another man who had been at the military encam pment with Feyman. I cou ld see an image of his face, and I recognized his expression, \"That'sjoel again, the journalist I met,\" I said to Wi l without losing my Focus on the image. Wil nocdded in response. After death, Joel had becom e a m ember of the outer soul ring and becam e totally dedicated to waking up Feyman. H is intention during the lifetime with Feyman had been to expose any cruelty or treachery on the part of the military toward the Nat ive Americans, but even though he had known about the smallpox con tamination, he had been persuaded to ke ep quiet by a com bination of biribes and threats. After death he had been devastated by his Life Review, but had remained con scious, and had vow ed"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"to help Feyman, who he felt had been ruined because of his failure to intervene. After a long period of time, Feyrnan finally responded and underwent a long and painful Life Review himself. H e had originally intended in the nineteenth-century life to becom e a ci vil engineer, irivolved in the peaceful development of technology. But he had been beguiled by the prospect of becom ing a w ar hero, like the com mander, and of developing new war strategies and devices. in the years between lives, he had been involved in helping others on Earth with the proper use of technology, when he slowly began to receive a vi sion of another life approach ing. Slowly at first and then with great con viction, he realized that soon mass-energy devices would be discove red that had the potential of liberating humankind. but these devices would be extremely dangerous. As he felt himself being born, he knew that he would com e to work with this technology, and he was well aware that in order to succeed, he would have to ag ain face his tendency to cr ave power and recognition and status. Yet he saw that he would have help; there would be six other people. H e visualized the val ley, working together somewhere in the dark, the falls in the backg round, utilizing a p rocess to bring in the Wor ld Vision. As he began to fade from view, I cou ld make out aspects of the process he was seeing. First the group of seven would begin to remember past experiences with each other and to work through the residual feelings. Then the group would con sciously am plify its energy, using the Eighth Insight techniques, and each would express his or her particular Birth Vision, and finally the vibration would acce lerate, unifying the soul groups of the seven individuals. O ut of the knowledge gained would com e the full memory of our intended future, the Wor ld Vision, the view of where we're going and what we have to do to reach our destiny. Suddenly the whole scene disappeared, along with Feyman's group. Wi l and I were left there alone. Wills eyes were animated. \"Do you see what was happening?\" he asked. \"This means that Feyman's original intention was act ually to perfect and decentralize the technology he's working on. If he realizes this fact, he will stop the experiment.\" \"We've got to find him,\" I said. \"No,\" Wil replied, pausing to think. \" That won't help, not yet. We 've got to find the rest of this group of seven; it must take the pooled energy of a g roup to bring in the memory of the Wor ld Vision, a g roup that can work through the process of remembering and energize themselves.\" \"I don't understand this part about clearing residual feelings.\" Wil moved closer. \"Remember the other mental images you've been havin ? The memories of other places, other times?\" \"Yes.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"\"The group that is forming to deal with this experiment has been together before. There will be residual feelings that must be worked through! Eve ryone will have to deal with them.\" Wil looke d away for a m oment, then said, \"This is more of the Tenth insight. Not just one group is com ing in; there are many others. We 'll all have to learn to cl ear these resentments.\" As he spoke, I thought about the many group situations I'd experienced, where some members of the group liked each other immediately, while others seemed to fall into instant discord, for no ap parent reason. I wondered: was human culture now ready to perceive the distant source of these unconscious reactions? Then, without warning, another shrill sound reverberated through my body. Wi l grabbed me and pulled me closer, our faces almost touching. \"If you fall again, I don't know if you can get back w hile the experiment is operating at this level,\" he shouted. \"You'll have to find the others!\" A second blast ripped us apart, and I felt myself release into the familiar swirling col ors, knowing that I was heading back, as before, into the Ear th dimension. Yet this time, instead of turn bling quickly into the physical, I seemed to linger momentarily; something was pulling at my solar plexus, moving me laterally. As I strained to focus, the surging environment cal med, and I began to sense the presence of another person, without act ually seeing the individual's form. I cou ld almost remember the character A the feeling. Who m akes me feel this way? At last I began to discern a b lurry figure thirty or forty feet away, which moved closer, gradually, until I recognized who it was. Charlene! As she closed to within ten feet, I sensed a shift in my body, as though I was suddenly relaxing more com pletely. Simultaneously I noticed a p inkisb-red energy field that encircled Charlene. Seconds later, to m y am azement, I noticed an identical field around myself. Wh en we were about five feet from each other, the relaxation in my body grew into an increased sensualness and finally into a w ave of orgasmic love. I suddenly cou ldn't think. Wh at was happening? just as our fields were about to touch, the shrill dissonance reLUmed and I was jolted backw ard again, twisting out of con trol. FORGIVING As my head cleared, I gradually becme aware of something col d and wet against my right cheek. S lowly I opened my eyes, the rest of my body frozen in place.

I still felt tired, but I was also an xious to fi' Suddenly I was jolted to m y feet by the sound of he Curtis. an explosion toward the east. That had to be Curtis, I thought, a I ran to the AL L tent. A wave of fear passed through me as I quickly packe d and headed toward the sound of the blast. After about a h alf mile the wood s ended abruptly at what appeared to be an abandoned pasture. Several strands of rusty barbed wire hung loosely between the trees in my path. I surveyed the open field and the line of trees and dense bush a h undred yards beyond. At that moment the bushes parted and Curtis burst through and headed in a d ead run straight toward me. I waved, and he immediately recognized who I was and slowed to a fast walk. Wh en he reached me, he car efully climbed through the barbed wire and col lapsed against a tree, breathing rapidly. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"What did you blow up?\" He shook h is head. \"I cou ldn't do m uch. They're running the experiment underground. I didn't have enough explosives, and I ... I didn't want to hurt the people inside. All I cou ld do was blow up an outside dish antenna, which hopefully will delay them.\" \"How did you get close enough to do that?\" \"I set the charges last night after dark. T hey must not expect anyone to be up here, because they have very few guards out side.\" He paused for a m oment as we heard the sound of trucks in the distance. \"We'll have to get out of this val ley,\" he con tinued, \"and find some help. We don't have any choice now. They'll be com ing.\" \"Wai t a m inute,\" I said. \"I think we have a ch ance to stop them, but we've got to find May a an d Charlene.\" His eyes widened. \"Are you talking about Charlene Billings?\" \"That's right.\" \"I know She used to do some con tract research for the corporation.

No m ovement. I listened car efully but cou ld hear nothing. We had walked in a n ortheasterly direction for about a m ile, and as quickly as I cou ld, I had told Curtis what I had experienced in the other dimension, stressing my belief that Williams had been cor rect. We cou ld stop this experiment if we cou ld find the rest of the group and remember the larger Vision. I cou ld tell that Curtis was resisting. H e had listened for a w hile, but then began rambling about his past association with Charlene. I was frustrated that he knew nothing that might explain what she had to do with this experiment. H e also told me how he had com e to kn ow David. They had becom e friends, he explained, after a ch ance meeting had revealed many com mon experiences in the military. I told him it was significant that he and I both had an association with David and that we knew Charlene. ,I don't know what it means,\" he had said distractedly, and I had dropped it, but I knew it was further proof that we had all com e to this valley for a reason. Afterward we had walked in silence as Curtis iearched for the cave . Wh en we had found it, he backt racke d afid erased our tracks with dead pine branches and then had lingered outside until he was con vinced we hadn't been seen. \"This soup is ready,\" Curtis said from behind me. I had used my cam p stove and water to cook t he last of my freeze-dried food . Wal king ove r, I made us both a b owl and then sat down again at the mouth of the cave , looki ng out. ,so how do you think this group can build enough energy to have an effect on these people?\" he asked. \"I'm not sure exactly,\" I replied. ,We'll have to figure it out.\" He shook h is head. \"I don't think an ything like that is possible. Probably all I did with my little bit of explosives was to irritate them and Put them more on guard. They'll bring more people in, but I don't think they will stop. They would have had a replacement antenna cl ose by. May be I should have taken out the door. G od knows I cou ld have. But I just cou ldn't bring my If to do that. Charlene was inside and who knows how many se others.

Curtis and I stared at each other for a long moment, then I moved to get up. \"I'll go get her,\" I said. He grabbed my arm. \"Stay low, and if the vehicles close in, leave her and com e back h ere. Don't risk being seen.\" I nodded and ran car efully down the hill. Wh en I was close enough, I stopped and listened. The trucks were still moving closer. I cal led out to her in a low voi ce. She froze for an instant, then recognized me and climbed up a rocky slope to where I stood . \"I can 't believe I found you!\" she said, hugging my neck. I led the way back t o the cave and helped her through the opening in the rock. S he appeared exhausted and her arms were cove red with scratches, some of them still bleeding. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"I heard an explosion, and then those trucks were everywhere.\" \"Did anyone see you com e this way?\" Curtis asked with irritation. H e was up and looki ng outside. \"I don't think so,\" she said. \"I was able to hide.\" I quickly introduced them. Curtis nodded and said, \"I think I'll take a look.\" He slipped out through the opening and disappeared. I opened my pack an d took ou t a first-aid kit. \"Were you able to find your friend with the Sheriff's Department?\" \"No, I cou ldn't even get back t o town.

You said Williams and Feyman had both seen seven.\" \"I don't know,\" I replied, \"I'm just glad you're here. You're the one who kn ows about faith and visualization.\" A look of terror crossed her face. A few moments later Curtis cam e back t hrough the opening and told us he had seen nothing out of the ordinary, then sat down away from us to finish his meal. I reached ove r and served another plate and gave it to May a. Curtis leaned back an d handed her a can teen. \"You know,\" he said, \"you took a h ell of a risk walking around in the open like that. You cou ld have led them right to us.\" May a glanced at me and then said defensively, \"I was trying to get away! I didn't know you were up here. I wouldn't even have com e this way if the birds hadn't-\" \"Well, you've got to understand how much trouble we're in!\" Curtis interrupted. \"We still haven't stopped this experiment.\" He got up and stepped outside again and sat behind a large rock n ear the opening. \"Why is he so m ad at me?\" May a as ked. \"You said you were having memories, May a. Wh at kind?\" \"I don't know ... of another time, I guess, of trying to stop some other violence. That's why all this is so eerie to m e.\" \"Does Curtis seem familiar to you?\" She struggled to think. \" May be. I don't know. Wh y?\" \"Do you remember when I told you about seeing a vi sion of all of us in the past, during the Nat ive American wars? We ll, you were killed, and someone else was with you who seemed to be following your lead, and he was killed too. I think it was Curtis.\" \"He blames me? O h God, no wonder he's so m ad.\" \"May a, can you remember anything about what you two were doing?\" She closed her eyes and tried to think. Suddenly she looke d at me. \"Was a Nat ive American also there? A shaman?\""},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"\"Yes,\" I said. \"He was killed too.\" \"We were thinking about something .

It's part of the process of remembering.\" \"Are you kidding? Wi th him this angry?\" \"I'll go speak w ith him first,\" I said, standing up. She nodded slightly and looke d away. I moved to the cave 's opening, crawled out, and sat down beside Curtis. \"What do you think?\" I asked. He looke d at me, slightly embarrassed. \"I think there's something about your friend that makes me mad.\" \"What are you feeling, exactly?\" \"I don't know. I felt angry as soon as I saw her out there. I got the sense she might pull some blunder and expose us, or get us cap tured.\" \"May be killed?\" \"Yeah, maybe killed!\" The force in his voi ce surprised both of us, and he took a b reath and shrugged. \"Remember when I told you about the visions I saw, of a time during the nineteenth-century Nat ive American wars?\" \"Vaguely,\" he muttered. well, I didn't tell you then, but I think I saw you and May a together. Curtis, you were both killed by soldiers.\" He looke d at the ceiling of the cave . \"And you think that's why I'm angry at her?\" I smiled. At that moment a light dissonance filled the air and we both heard the hum. \"Damn,\" he said. \"They're firing it up again.\" I grabbed his arm. \"Curtis, we've got to figure out what you and May a were trying to do back t hen, why you failed, and what you intended to happen differently this time.\" He shook h is head. \"I don't know how much of all this I even believe; I wouldn't know where to begin.\" \"I think if you just talk with her, something will com e up.\" He just looke d at me. \"Will you try?\""},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Finally he nodded and we crawled back i nto the cave . May a smiled awkwardly. \"I'm sorry I've been so an gry,\" Curtis offered. \"It seems maybe I'm mad about something that occu rred a long time ago.\" \"Forget it,\" she said. \"I just wish we cou ld remember what we were trying to do.\" Curtis looke d hard at May a. \" I seem to remember you're into healing of some kind.\" He glanced at me. \"Did you tell me that?\" \"I don't think so,\" I replied, \"but it's true.\" \"I'm a p hysician,\" May a said. \"I use positive imaging and faith in my work.\" \"Faith? You mean you treat people from a religious perspective?\" \"Well, only in a g eneral sense. Wh en I said faith, I meant the energy force that com es from human expectation. I work at a cl inic where we're trying to understand faith as an act ual mental process, as the way we help create the future.\" \"And how long have you been into al l this?\" Curtis asked. \"My whole life has prepared me to explore healing.\" She went on to tell Curtis the same story of her life that she had told me earlier, including her mother's tendency to worry that she would get can cer. As May a discussed all that had happened to her, both Curtis and I asked questions. As we listened and gave her energy, the fatigue that had shown on her face began to ease, her eyes brightened, and she began to sit up straight. Curtis asked, \"You believe your mother's worry and negative vision of her future affected her health?\" \"Yes. H umans seem to help draw into their lives two particular kinds of events: what we have faith in and what we fear. Bu t we're doing it unconsciously. As a p hysician, I believe much can be gained by pulling the process fully into con sciousness.\" Curtis nodded, \"But how is that done?\" May a didn't answer. She stood up and stared straight ahead, a p anicked look on her face. \"What's wrong?\" I asked. \"I was just ... I ... s ee what happened during the wars.\" \"What was it?\" Curtis asked. She looke d at him. \"I remember we were there in the wood s. I can see it all: the soldiers, smoke from the gunpowder.\" Curtis seemed to be pulled into deep thought, obviously picking up on the memory. \"I was there,\" he mumbled. \"Why was I there?\" He looke d at May a. \" You brought me to that place! I knew nothing; I was just a con gressional observer. You told me we"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"could stop the fighting!\" She turned away, obviously struggling to understand. \"I thought we could . . . T here's a w ay . . . Wai t a m inute, we weren't alone.\" She turned and stared at me, an angry expression appearing on her face. \"You were there, too, but you abandoned us. Wh y did you leave us?\" Her statement stirred the memory I had brought back e arlier and told them both what I had seen, describing the others who were also there: the elders of several tribes, myself, Charlene. I explained that one elder voi ced strong support of May a's efforts, but believed the time was not right, arguing that the tribes had not yet found their cor rect vision. I told them another chief had exploded with rage at the atrocities perpetrated by the white soldiers. \"I cou ldn't stay,\" I told them, describing my memory of the experience with the Franciscans. \"I cou ldn't shake the need to run. I had to save myself. I'm sorry.\" May a seemed lost in thought, so I touched her arm and said, \"The elders knew it cou ldn't work; and Charlene con firmed that we hadn't yet remembered the ancestors'wisdom.\" \"Then why did one of the chiefs stay with us?\" she asked. \"Because he didn't want the two of you to die alone.\" \"I didn't want to die at all!\" Curtis snapped, looki ng at May a. \"You misled me.\" ,,I'm sorry\" she said. \"I can 't remember what went wrong.\" \"I know what went wrong,\" he said. \"You thought you cou ld stop a w ar just because you wanted to.\" She gazed at him for a long moment, then looke d at me. \"He's right. We were visualizing that the soldiers must stop their aggression, Out we had no cl ear picture of how that cou ld happen. It didn't work because we didn't have all the information. Everyone was visualizing from fear, not faith. It works just like the process of healing our bodies. Wh en we remember what we're really supposed to do in life, it can restore our health. When we're able to remember what all of humanity is supposed to do, starting right now, from this moment, we can heal the world.\" \"Appareiltly,\" I said, \"our Birth Vision con tains not only what we individually intended to do in the physical dimension but also a l arger vision of what humans have been trying to do throughout istory, and the details of where we are going from here and how to get there. We just have to am plify our energy and share our birth intentions, and then we can remember.\" Before slie cou ld respond, Curtis jumped to his feet and moved to the cave 's opening. \"I heard something,\" he said. \"Someone's (ut there.\" May a an d I crouched beside him, straining to see. Not hing moved; then I"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"thought I detected the rustling sound of someone walking. \"I'm going to ch eck t his out,\" Curtis said, moving through the opening. I glanced at May a. \" I had better go with him.\" \"I'm com ing too,\" she said. We followed Curtis down the slope to an outcropping where we cou ld look straight dcvn at the gorge between the two hills. A man and a w oman, partally obscured by the underbrush, were crossing the rocks below -is, heading toward the west. \"That woman's in trouble!\" May a said. \"How do you know dat?\" I asked. \"I just know. She loolis familiar.\" The woman turned crice and the man pushed her menacingly, exposing a pistol hEld in his right hand. May a leaned forward looki ng at both of us. \"Did you see that? We 've got to do something.\" I looke d closely. The woman had light hair and was dressed in a sweatshirt and green'atigues with leg pocke ts. As I watched, she turned and said something to her cap tor, then glanced toward us, giving me a clear look at her face. \"That's Charlene,\" I gid. \"Where do you think he's taking her?\" \"Who kn ows?\" CurtiE replied. \"Look, I think I can help her but I have to go al one. I reed both of you to stay here.\" I Protested but Curis would have it no ot her way. We watched him as he walked back t o the left and down the slope through a section of wools. From there, he crept quietly to an other outcropping of roc j ust ten feet above the bottom of the gorge. \"They'll have to pass Jight by him,\" I told May a. We observed anxious as they moved closer to the rocks . At the precise moment theyhad passed, Curtis bounded down the hill and leaped upon the man, knocki ng him to the ground and holding his throat in a p eculiar fashion until he stopped moving. Charlene jumped back i nalarm. an d gathered herself to run. \"Charlene, wait!\" Curis cal led. She stopped and took a cau lk tious step forward. \"It's Curtis We bber. We worked together at Deltech, remember? I'm here to help you.\" She obviously recognized him and moved closer. May a an d I made our way carefully down the hill. Wh en Charlene saw me, she froze and then ran toward my embrace. Curtis rushed up and pushed us to the ground. \"Keep down,\" he said. \"We cou ld be seen here.\" I helped Curtis tie up Charlene's guard with a roll of tape we found in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"his pocke t and pulled him up the slope into the forest. \"What did you do to him?\" Charlene asked. Curtis was checking his pocke ts. \"I just knocke d him out. He'll be okay .\" May a bent down to ch eck h is pulse. Charlene turned her attention to m e, reaching out for my hand. \"How did you get here?\" she asked. Taking a b reath, I told her about the cal l from her office informing me of her disappearance and about finding the sketch and com ing to the valley to look f or her. She smiled. \"I made that sketch intending to cal l you, but I left so suddenly I didn't have time . H er voi ce trailed off as she looke d deeply into m y eyes. \"I think I saw you yesterday, in the other dimension.\" I pulled her to the side, away from the others. \"I saw you too, but I couldn't com municate.\" As we stared at each other, I felt my body grow lighter, a w ave of orgasmic love sweeping acr oss me, centered not in my pelvic region, but somehow around the outside of my skin. Simultaneously I seemed to be falling into Charlene's eyes. H er smile grew and I realized she must be feeling much the same way. A movement from Curtis broke the spell, and I realized both he and May a were staring at us. Ilooke d back at Charlene. \"I want to tell you what's been happening,\" I said, then described seeing Wil again, leaming about the polarization of Fear, and the group com ing back, and the Wor ld Vision. \"Charlene, how did you get into the Afterlife dimension?\" Her face fell. \"All this is my fault. I didn't know the danger until yesterday. I'm the one who told Feyman about the insights. Shortly after receiving your letter, I found out about another group that knew of the nine Insights, and I studied with them intensely. I had many of the same experiences you talked about. Later I cam e with a friend to this val ley because we had heard that the sacred locat ions here were con nected somehow with the Tenth Insight. My friend didn't experience much, but I did, so I stayed to explore. That's when I met Feyman, who employed me to teach him what I knew. From that moment forward he was with me every minute. H e insisted I not cal l my office, for security reasons, so I wrote letters rescheduling all my appointments, only, as it turned out, I guess he was intercepting my letters. That's why everyone thought I was missing. \"With Feyman I explored most of the vor texes, especially the ones at Codder's Knoll and The Falls. H e cou ldn't sense the energy personally, but I found out later that he was tracki ng us electronically and getting some sort of energy profile on me as we tuned into the locat ions. After that he cou ld hone in on the area an d find the exact locat ion of the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"vortex electronically.\" I glanced at Curtis and he nodded knowingly. Tears filled Charlene's eyes. \"He had me com pletely fooled. He said that he was working on a ve ry inexpensive source of energy that will liberate everyone. H e sent me to remote areas of t he forest during much of the experimentation. O nly later, after I confronted him, did he admit the dangers of what he was doing.\" Curtis turned to face Charlene. \"Feyman Carter was a ch ief engineer at Deltech. Do you remember?\" \"No,\" she said, \"but he's totally in con trol of this project. Another cor poration is now involved; and they have these armed men. Feyman cal ls them operatives. I finally told him I was leaving, and that's when he put me under guard. Wh en I told him he would never get away with this, he just laughed. H e bragged about having someone in the Forest Service working with him.\" \"Where was he sending you?\" Curtis asked. Charlene shook h er head. \"I have no idea.\" \"I don't think he intended to let you live,\" Curtis said. \"Not after telling you all that.\" An anxious silence fell ove r the group. \"What I can 't understand,\" Charlene said, \"is why he's here in this forest in the first place. Wh at does he want with these energy locat ions?\" Curtis and I met eyes again, then he said, \"He's experimenting with a way of centralizing this energy source he's found by focusing on the dimensional pathways in this val ley. That's why it's so dangerous.\" I becam e aware that Charlene was staring at May a an d smiling. May a returned the gaze with a w arm expression. \"When I was at the falls,\" Charlene said, \"I moved through into the other dimension, and all these memories rushed in.\" She looke d at me. \"After that, I was able to go back s everal times, even when I was under guard, yesterday.\" She looke d at me again. \"That's where I saw you . . . Charlene paused and looke d back at the group. \"I saw that we're all here to stop this experiment, if we can remember everything.\" May a was watching her closely. \"You understood what we wanted to do during the battle with the soldiers, and supported us,\" she said. \"Even though you knew it cou ldn't work.\" Charlene's smile told me she had remembered. \"We've remembered most of what happened,\" I said. \"But so far we haven't been able to recall how we planned to do it differentry this time.

It's com ing in intuitively.\" I nodded. \"We know.\" \"Part of the Tenth is an extension of the Eighth. O nly a g roup that's operating fully in the Eighth Insight can accom plish this kind of higher clearing.\" \"I'm not following you,\" Curtis said. \"The Eighth is about knowing how to uplift others,\" she con tinued, \"knowing how to send energy by focusing on another's beauty and higher-self wisdom. This process can raise the energy level and creativity of the group exponentially. Un fortunately, many groups have trouble uplifting each other in this manner, even though the individuals involved are able to do it at other times. This is especially true if the group is work-or iented, a g roup of employees, for instance, or people com ing together to cr eate a u nique project of some kind, because so of ten these people have been together before, and old, past-life emotions com e up and get in the way. \"We are thrown together with someone we have to work with, and we automatically dislike them, without really knowing why. O r perhaps we experience it the other way around: the person doesn't like us, again for reasons we don't understand. The emotions that com e up might be jealousy, irritation, envy, resentment, bitterness, blame-any of these. Wh at I intuited very clearly was that no group cou ld reach its highest potential unless the participants seek to understand and work through these emotions.\" May a leaned forward. \"That's exactly what we've been doing: working through the emotions that have com e up, the resentments from when we were together before.\" \"Were you shown your Birth Vision?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" Charlene replied. \"But I cou ldn't get any further. I didn't have enough energy. All I saw was that groups were forming and that I was supposed to be here in this val ley, in a g roup of seven.\" Presently the sound of another vehicle far to the north attracted our attention. \"We can 't stay here,\" Curtis said. \"We're too e xposed. Let's back t o the cave .\" Charlene finished the last of the food and handed me the plate. Having no extra water, I placed it in my pack d irty and sat down again. Curtis slipped through the mouth of the cave and sat down acr oss from me beside May a, who smiled faintly at him. Charlene sat to m y left.

I think we need to stay in here until dark.\" For a m oment we all just looke d at each other, each of us obviously trying to raise our energy. I looke d at the others and told them about the process of reaching the Wor ld Vision I had seen with Feyman's soul group. When I had con cluded, I looke d at Charlene and asked, \"What i else did you receive about this clearing process?\" \"All I got,\" Charlene replied, \"was that the process cou ldn't begin until we com e totally back t o love.\" \"That's easy to say,\" Curtis said. \"The problem is doing it.\" We all looke d at each other again, then simultaneously realized the energy was moving to May a. \"The key is to ackn owledge the emotion, to becom e fully con scious of the feeling, and then to share it honestly, no m atter how awkward our attempts. This brings the emotion fully into present awareness and ultimately allows it to be relegated to the past, where it belongs. That's why going through the sometimes long process of saying it, discussing it, putting it on the table, clears us, so that we're able to return to a s tate of love, which is the highest emotion.\" \"Wai t a m inute,\" I said. \"What about Charlene? There may be residual emotions toward her.\" I looke d at May a. \" I know you felt something.\" \"Yes,\" May a replied. \"But only positive feelings, a sense of gratitude. She stayed and tried to help . . .\" May a paused, studying Charlene's face. \"You tried to tell us something, something about the ancestors. But we didn't listen.\" I leaned toward Charlene. \"Were you killed too?\" May a an swered for her. \"No, she wasn't killed. She had gone to try to appeal to the soldiers one more time.\" \"That's right,\" Charlene said. \"But they were gone.\" May a as ked, \"Who else feels something toward Charlene?\" \"I don't feel anything,\" Curtis said. J \"What about you, Charlene?\" I asked. \"What do you feel I toward us?\" L Her gaze swept acr oss each member of the group. \"There don't seem to be any residual feelings toward Curtis,\" she said. \"And everything is positive toward May a.\" Her eyes settled on mine. \"Toward you I think I feel a b it of resentment.\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\"Why?\" I asked. \"Because you were so practical and detached.

I felt it would have been useless.\" My protests seemed to irritate her and she looke d away. May a reached ove r and touched me. \"Your com ment was defensive. Wh en you respond that way, the other person doesn't feel heard. The emotion she harbors then lingers in her mind because she con tinues to think of ways to m ake you understand, to con vince you. O r it goes unconscious and then there's ill feeling that dulls the energy between you two. Either way the emotion remains a p roblem, getting in the way. I suggest you ackn owledge how she cou ld be feeling that.\" I looke d at Charlene. \"Oh, I do. I wish that I had helped, May be I could have done something, if I had had the cou rage.\" Charlene nodded and smiled. \"How about you?\" May a as ked, looki ng at me. \"What do you feel toward Charlene?\" \"I guess I feel some guilt,\" I said. \"Not so m uch guilt about the war, but about now, this situation. I had been withdrawn for several months. I think if I had talked to you immediately after returning from Peru, maybe we cou ld have stopped the experiment earlier and none of this would be happening.\" No on e replied. \"Are there any other feelings?\" May a as ked. We only looke d at each other. At this point, under May a's direction, each of u focused on con necting inside, with building as much energy as xe cou ld. As I focused on the beauty around me, a w ave of love svept through my body. The muted col or of the cave walls and floor began to brighten and glow. Each person's face began to ap pear more energized. A chill ran up my spine. \"Now ,\" May a said, \"we're ready to figure out what we intended to do this time.\" She again appeared to be in deep thought. \"I ... I knew this was going to happen,\" sl-r said finally. \"This was part of my Birth Vision. I was to lead the Lmplification proces5. We didn't know how to do this when we tried to stop the war on the Nat ive Americans.\" As she spoke, I noticed a m ovement behind hEr against the cave wall. At first I thought it was a reflection of ligit, but then I detected a d eep shade of green exactly like the on( I witnessed earlier, when observing May a's soul group. As I strugled to focus on the foot-square blob of light, it swelled into a f ully holographic SCene receding into the wall itself, full of fuzz h umanlike forms. I glanced at the others; no on e seemed to 2e the image except me. This, I knew, was May a's soul group, and as soor as I had this"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"realization, I began to receive an inflow of intuitive hformation. I could see her Birth Vision again, her higher intenion of being born to her particular family, her mother's illness, The resulting interest in medicine, particularly the mind/body com ection, and now this gathering. I clearly heard that \"no group --an reach its full creative power until it con sciously clears and tlen am plifies its energy. \"Orice free of the emotions,\" May a was now sayng, \"a group can more easily move past power struggles and dranas and find its full creativity. Bu t we have to do it con sciously by finding a higher-self expression in every face.\" Curtis' blank look p rovoke d more explanation. \"As the Eighth Insight reveals,\" May a con tinued, \"if we look cl osely at another person's face, we can cut through any facad es, or ego defenses, that may be present, and find the individual's authentic expression, his or her real self. Ordinarily most people don't know what to focus on when talking to another. Should it e t e eyes? It's hard to focus on both. So which one? O r should it be on the feature that most stands out, such as the nose or mouth? \"In truth, we are cal led upon to focus on the whole of the face, which with its uniqueness of light and shadow and alignment of features is much like an inkblot. Bu t within this col lection of features, one can find an authentic expression, the soul shining forth. Wh en we focus in love, love energy is sent to this higher-self aspect of the person, and the person will seem to ch ange before our eyes as his or her greater capabilities shift into place. \"All great teachers have always sent this kind of energy toward their students. That's why they were great teachers. Bu t the effect is even greater with groups who interact this way with Jim every member, because as each person sends the others energy, all of the members rise to a n ew level of wisdom which has more energy at its disposal, and this greater energy is then sent back t o everyone else in what becom es an am plification effect.\" I watched May a, attempting to find her higher expression. No l onger did she appear tired, or reluctant in any way. Instead, her features revealed a ce rtainty and genius she had not expressed before. I glanced toward the others and saw that they were similarly focused on May a. Wh en I looke d at her again, I noticed that she seemed to be taking on the green hue of her soul group. She was not only picking up on their knowledge; she seemed to be moving into a ki nd of harmony with them. May a had stopped speaking arkd was taking a d eep breath. I cou ld feel the energy shifting away from her. \"I've always known that groups cou ld acq uire a h igher level of functioning,\" Curtis said, \"especially in work settings. Bu t I haven't been able to experience this until now ... I know I cam e into t is mension to e involved in transforming business, and shifting our view of business creativity, so that we can ultimately utilize the new energy sources in the cor rect way and implement the Ninth Insight automation of production.\" He paused in thought, then said, \"I mean, business is too of ten labeled"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"as the greedy villain, out of con trol, with no con science. And I guess it's been exactly that in the past. Bu t I've felt as though business, too, was moving into a s piritual awareness, and that we needed a n ew kind of business ethic.\" At that moment I saw another movement of light, directly behind Curtis. I watched for a few seconds, then realized I was seeing the formation of his soul group as well. As with May a's group, when I focused on the emerging image, I was again able to pick u p on their col lective knowledge. Curtis was born in the peak of the industrial revolution occu rring just after Wor ld War II. Nu clear power had been the final triumph and shocki ng horror of the materialist worldview, and he had entered with a vi sion that technological advancement cou ld now be made conscious and moved, in full awareness, toward its destined purpose. \"Only now,\" Curtis said, \"are we ready to understand how to evolve business and the resulting new technology in a con scious manner; all the measures are now in place. It's not an acci dent that one of the most important statistical cat egories in economics is the productivity index: the record of how many good s and F services are produced by each individual in our society. Productivity has steadily increased because of technological discove ries and the more expansive use of natural resources and energy. Through the years the individual has found ever-greater ways to cr eate. As he spoke, a thought cam e to m e. At first I decided to ke ep it to myself, bit then everyone looke d my way. \"Doesn't the environmental darriage that economic growth is cau sing form a n atural limit to business? We can 't go on like we have, because if we do, the environment will literally fall apart. Man y of the fish in the oce an are already so polluted we can 't eat them. Cancer rates are increasing exponentially. Eve n the AMA says that pregnant women and children should not eat com mercial vegetables because of the pesticide residue. If this keeps up, can you imagine what kind of world we'll be leaving our children?\" As soon as I had said this, I recalled what Joel had said earlier about the col lapse of the environment. I cou ld feel my energy j! falling as I felt the same Fear. Suddenly I was hit with a b urst of energy, as each of the others stared in an effort to find my authentic expression again. I r quickly reestablished my inner con nection. \"You're right,\" Curtis said, \"but our response to this problem is already occu rring. We 've been advancing technology with a ki nd of unconscious tunnel vision, forgetting that we're here on an organic planet, an energy planet. Bu t one of the most creative areas of business is the field of pollution con trol. \"Our problem has been trying to depend on government to police the polluters. Polluting has been against the law for a long time, but there will never be enough government regulation to prevent the illegal dumping of waste chemicals or the midnight venting of smoke stacks . This polluting of the biosphere won't com pletely stop until an alarmed citizenry pulls out their video"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"recorders and takes it upon themselves to cat ch these people in the act . In a sense, business and the employees of business must regulate themselves.\" May a leaned forward. \"I see another problem with the way the economy is evolving. Wh at about all the displaced workers who ar e losing their jobs as more of the economy is automated? How can they survive? We used to have a large middle class and now it is diminishing rapidly.\" Curtis smiled and his eyes brightened. The image of his soul group swelled behind him. \"These displaced people will survive by learning to live intuitively and synchronistically,\" he said. \"We all have to understand: there's no going back. We 're already living in the information age. Eve ryone will have to educate themselves the best they can, becom e an expert in some niche, so that they can be in the right place to ad vise someone else or perform some other service. The more technical the automation becom es, and the more quickly the world changes, the more we need information from just the right person arriving in our lives at just the right time. You don't need a formal education to do that; just a n iche you've created for yourself through self-education. \"Yet, for this flow to be optimally established, acr oss the economy, the stated purposes of business must shift into higher awareness. O ur guiding intuitions becom e most clear when we approach business from an evolutionary perspective. O ur questions must change. Instead of asking what product or service I can develop to m ake the most money, we're beginning to as k, 'What can I produce that liberates and informs and makes the world a b etter place, yet also preserves a d elicate environmental balanceT \"A new cod e of ethics is being added to the equation of free enterprise. We have to com e awake wherever we are and ask, Wh at are we creating and does it con sciously serve the ove rall purpose for which technology was invented in the first place: to m ake everyday subsistence easier, so that the prevailing orientation of life can shift from mere survival and com fort to the interchange of pure spiritual information?\" Each of us has to see that we have a p art in the evolution toward lower and lower subsistence cos ts, until finally the basic m eans of survival is virtually free. \"We can move toward a truly enlightened cap italism if, instead of charging as much as the market will bear, we follow a n ew business ethic based on lowering our prices a specified percentage as a con scious statement of where we want the economy to go. T his would be the business equivalent of engaging in the Ninth Insight force of tithing.\" Charlene turned to face him, her face luminous. \"I understand what you're saying. You mean, if all businesses reduce prices ten percent, then everyone's cos t of living, including the raw materials and supplies to the businesses themselves, will also go down.\" \"That's right, although some prices might go up temporarily as everyone takes into accou nt the true cos t of waste disposal and other environmental effects. O verall, though, prices will systematically decline.\" \"Doesn't this process already happen at times,\" I asked, \"as a result of market forces?\""},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"\"Of cou rse,\" he replied, \"but it can be acce lerated if we do it consciously-although as the Ninth Insight predicts, this process will be greatly enhanced by the discove ry of a ve ry inexpensive energy source. It appears as if Feyman has done that. Bu t the energy has to be made avai lable in the most inexpensive way possible if it is to have its most liberating impact.\" As he spoke, he seemed to grow more inspired. Turning, he looke d straight into m y eyes. \"This is the economic idea I cam e here wanting to con tribute,\" he said. \"I've never seen it so cl early. That's why I wanted to have the life experiences I've had; I wanted to be prepared for delivering this message.\" \"Do you really think enough people will reduce prices to m ake a d i.., rence?\" May a as ked. \"Especially i it takes money out of their own pocke ts? That seems to fly in the face of human nature.\" Curtis didn't answer. Instead he looke d at me, along with the others, as if I had the answer. For a m oment I was silent, feeling the energy shift. \"Curtis is right,\" I said finally \"We'll do it anyway, even though we may give up some personal profit in the short run. Non e of this makes any sense at all until we grasp the Ninth and Tenth Insights. If one believes that life is just a m atter of personal survival in an essentially meaningless and unfriendly world, then it makes perfect sense to focus all one's wits on living as com fortably as possible and seeing to it that one's children have the same opportunities. Bu t if one grasps the first nine Insights and sees life as a spiritual evolution, with spiritual responsibilities, then our view com pletely changes. \"And once we begin to understand the Tenth, then we see the birth process from the perspective of the Afterlife, and we realize that we're all here to bring the Ear th dimension into al ignment with the Heavenly sphere. Be sides, opportunity and success are very mysterious processes, and if we operate our economic life in the flow of the ove rall plan, we synchronistically meet all b the other people who ar e doing the same thing, and suddenly prosperity opens up for us. \"We'll do it,\" I con tinued, \"because individually that's where the intuition and coi ncidences will take us. We 'll remember more about our Birth Visions and it will becom e clear that we intended to m ake a certain con tribution to the world. And most important, we'll know that if we don't follow this intuition, not only will the magic coi ncidences and the sense of inspiration and aliveness stop, but eventually we may have to look at our act ions in an Afterlife Review. We 'll have to face our failure.\" harlene and Mava w ere I stopped abruptly, noticing that C both staring wide-eyed at the space behind me. Reflexively I turned"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"around; there was the hazy outline of my own soul group, dozens of individuals fading into the distance, again as though the walls of the cave weren't there. \"What are all of you looki ng at?\" Curtis asked. \"It's his soul group,\" Charlene said. \"I saw these groups when I was at the falls.\" \"I've seen a g roup behind both May a an d Curtis,\" I said. May a twisted around and looke d at the space behind her. The fully into focus. group there flickered once, then cam e \"I don't see anything,\" Curtis said. \"Where are they?\" May a con tinued to stare, obviously seeing all of the groups. \"They're helping us, aren't they? They can give us the vision we're looki ng for.\" As soon as she made that com ment, all of the groups moved away from us dramatically and becam e less clear. ,What happened?\" May a as ked. \"It's your expectation,\" I said. \"If you look t o them for your energy, as a replacement for your own inner con nection to divine energy, they leave. They won't allow a d ependence. The same thing happened to m e.\" Charlene gave me a n od of agreement. \"It happened to m e too. T hey're like family. We 're con nected to them in thought, but we have to sustain our own con nection with the divine source beyond them before we can link to them and pick u p on what they know, which is really your own higher memory.\" \"They hold the memory for us?\" May a as ked. \"Yes Charlene replied, looki ng directly at me. She started to say something else, then stopped herself, appearing to drift off in thought. Then she said, \"I'm beginning to understand what I saw in the other dimension. In the Afterlife each of us com es from a p articular soul group, and these groups each have a p articular angle or truth to of fer the rest of humanity.\" She glanced at me. \"For instance, you com e from a g roup of facilitators. D o you know that? Souls that help evolve our philosophical understanding of what life is about. Eve ryone who belongs to this particular soul group is always trying to find the best and most com prehensive way of describing spiritual reality. You struggle with com plex information, and because you're so dense, you keep pushing and exploring until you find a w ay to express it clearly.\" I looke d at her askance, which made her burst out laughing. \"It's a g ift you have,\" she said reassuringly."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Turning to May a, she said, \"And you, May a, your soul group is oriented toward health and well-being.

Throughout human history this group has been working to spiritualize our concepts of money and cap italism, to find the ideal con --eptualization.\" She paused, and I cou ld already see an image of light flickering behind her. \"What about you, Charlene?\" I asked. \"What is your group doing?\" \"We re journalists, researchers,\" she replied, \"working to help people appreciate and learn from each other. Wh at jourralism is really all about is looki ng deeply at the life and beliefs of the people and organizations we cove r, at their true substance and higher expression, just the way we're looki ng at each other now.\" I again remembered my con versation with Joel, specifically his jaded cynicism. \"It's hard to see journalists doing that,\" I said. \"We're not,\" she replied. \"Not yet. Bu t this is the ideal toward which the profession is evolving. This is our true desti iry, once we becom e more secure and break f ree from the old worldview in which we need to 'win' and bring energy and status oLr way. \"It makes perfect sense why I wanted to be born to m y family They were all so inquisitive. I picked up on their excrement, their need for information. That's why I was a reporter for so long, and then joined the research firm. I wanted to help work ou t the ethics of reporting and then com e together with al' ' of. . .\" She drifted away again, staring at the floor of the cave ' then her eyes widened and she said, \"I know how we're bringing in the Wor ld Vision. As we remember our Birth Visions and integrate them together as a g roup, we merge the power of our relaxed soul groups in the other dimension, which helps us remembr even more, so we finally get to the ove rall vision of the world.\" We all stared at her, puzzled. \"Look at the whole picture,\" she explained. \"Each peTson on Ear th belongs to a s oul group, and these soul groups represent the var ious occu pational groups that exist on the planet: medical people, lawyers, accou ntants, com puter workers, farmers, every field of human endeavor . O nce people find their right work, the job that really fits them, then they are working with other members of their soul group. \"As each of us wakes up and begins to remember our Birth Vision-why we're here-the occu pational groups to which we belong com e more into alignment with the members of our groups in the other dimension. As this happens, each occu pational group on Ear th moves toward its true soul purpose, its role of service in human society.\" We all con tinued to be spellbound."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"\"It's like with us journalists,\" she con tinued. \"Throughout history we have been the individuals most inquisitive about what others in the culture were doing. And then a few centuries ago, we becam e con scious enough of ourselves to form a d efined occu pation. Since then we've been busy broad ening our use of the media, reaching more and more people with our newscasts, that sort of thing. Bu t like everyone else, we suffered from insecurity. We felt that to get attention and energy from the rest of humanity we had to cr eate increasingly more sensational stories, thinking that only negativity and violence sell. \"But that's not our true role. O ur spiritual role is to deepen and spiritualize our perception of other people. We see and then com municate what the var ious soul groups, and individuals within these groups, are doing, and what they stand for, making it easier for everyone to learn the truth others provide, \"It's the same for every occu pational group; we're all awakening to ou r true message and purpose. And as this happens all ove r the planet, we're then able to go further. We can form close spiritual associations with people outside of our particular soul group, just the way we're doing here. We all shared our Birth A Visions and raised our vibration together, and that transforms not only human society but the culture in the Afterlife as well. \"First, each of our soul groups com es closer into vi bration with us on Earth and we with them, the two dimensions opening into each other. Because of this closure, we can begin to have com munication between the dimensions. We are able to see souls in the Afterlife and pick u p on their knowledge and memory more readily. That's happening with increasing frequency on the Ear th.\" As Charlene was speaking, I noticed the soul groups behind each of us widening and spreading out until each touched the others, forming a continuous circle around us. The con vergence seemed to jolt me into an even higher awareness. Charlene seemed to feel it too. S he took a b reath and then with emphasis con tinued. \"The other thing that happens in the Afterlife is that the groups themselves com e closer into resonance with each other. That's why the Ear th is the primary focus of the souls in Heaven. They can't unite on their own. O ver there, many soul groups remain fragmented and out of resonance with each other because they live in an imaginary world of ideas that manifests instantly and disappears just as quickly, so reality is always arbitrary. There is no natural world, no atomic structure, as we have here, that serves as a stable platform, a backg round stage, that is com mon to al l of us. We affect what happens on this stage, but ideas manifest much more slowly and we must reach some agreement on what we want to happen in the future. It's this agreement, this con sensus, this unity of vision on the Ear th, that also pulls the soul roups together in the Afterlife dimension. That's why the Ear th dimension is deemed so important. The where the true unification of souls is taking physical dimension is taking place! \"And it's this unification that Is behind the long historical journey"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"that humans have been taking.

The physical arena is the theater upon which evolution has been playing out for both dimensions, and now 're bringing it all into cu lmination as we remem er conwe sciously what's going on.\" She pointed to us with a sweeping motion of her finger. \"This is the awareness that we're remembering together, right nowand it's the awareness that other groups, just like us, are remembering all ove r the planet.

Specks of dust fell from the ceiling. Simultaneously we heard the hum again, but this nance had disappeared; it sounded almost harmotime the disso mous. \"Oh God,\" Curtis said. \"They almost have the cal ibrations right. We have to go back t o the bunker.\" He made a m ovement to get up, as the energy level of the group plummeted. \"Wai t,\" I said. \"What are we going to do there? We agreed that we would wait here until dark; there's still hours of daylight out there. I say we stay here. We ach ieved a h igh level of energy, but we haven't moved through the rest of the process yet.

REMEMBER ING THE FUTURE W kn elt at the top of the hill and looke d car efully down at the base of a larger ridge. I cou ld see nothing out of the ordinary in the fading light; no m ovement, no guards. The hum, which had persisted for most of the forty-minute walk, had now com pletely disappeared. \"Are you sure we're at the right place?\" I asked Curtis. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Do you see the four large boulders about fifty feet up the slope? The doorway is right beneath them, hidden in the bushes. To the right, you can just make out the top of the projection dish. it looks functional again.\" \"I see it,\" May a said. \"Where are the guards?\" I asked Curtis. \"May be they've abandoned the site.\" We observed the doorway for almost an hour, waiting for signs of activity, hesitant to m ove or talk m uch until darkness had fallen acr oss the val ley. Suddenly we heard movement beflood ing us in light, and four hind us. Flashlights clicked on, armed men rushed in, demanding that we raise our hands. After spending ten minutes going through our gear, they searched each of us, then moved the group down the hill and up to the bunker's entrance. The door of the bunker swung open and Feyman charged out, loud and angry. \"Are these the ones we've been looki ng for?\" he shouted. \"Where did you find them?\" One of the guards explained what had happened as Feyman shook h is head and stared at us through the beams of light. H e walked closer and demanded, \"What are you doing here?\" \"You've got to stop what you're doing!\" Curtis retorted. Feyman was struggling to recognize him. \"Who ar e you?\" The guards' flashlights settled, illuminating Curtis' face. \"Curtis We bber ...

We moved closer together and our col lective thought seemed to project the image of fighting back. We knew that somehow we cou ld marshal our forces and push back t he negative and destructive attempts of the experiment. I even picked up a p icf Feyman being pushed backw ard, his equipment blowing ture o u p and burning, his men fleeing in terror. Another surge in the noise disrupted My focus; the experiment was continuing. Fifty feet away, a h uge pine tree snapped half and thundered to the ground. Wi th a ripping sound and in a cl oud of dust, a fissure, five feet wide, opened up between us and the guard on the right. H e reeled back i n horror, the beam of his flashlight swinging wild in the night. \"This isn't working!\" May a screamed. Another tree crashed to the ground on our left as the earth slid four or five feet, knocki ng us flat. May a looke d horrified and jumped to her feet. \"I've got to get from here!\" she yelled, then began to run north into the away darkness. The guard on that side., lying where he had been thrown by the earth's movement, rolled to his knees and cau ght her form in the beam of his flashlight, then raised his gun. \"No! Wai t!\" I screamed. As she ran, May a looke d back, spotting the guard who was now aiming directly at her, preparing to fire. The scene seemed to shift into slow motion, and as the gun discharged, every line in her face revealed an awareness that she was about to die. Bu t instead of the bullets ripping into her side and back, a w isp of white light darted in front of her and the bullets bore no effect. She hesitated momentarily, then disappeared into the darkness. At the same time, sensing the opportunity, Charlene leaped up from her position to m y right and ran to the northeast, into the dust, her movement unnoticed by the guards. I started to run but the guard who had fired at May a turned his weapon toward me. Q uickly Curtis reached out and grabbed legs, dragging me to the ground. MY Behind us, the bunker door swung open and Feyman ran to the dish antenna and furiously adjusted the keyboard. G radually the noise began to diminish and the earth movements slowed to m ere tremors. \"For God sakes!\" Curtis yelled toward him. \"You've got to stop this!\""},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Feyman's face was cove red with dust. \"There's nothing wrong that we can't fix,\" he said with eerie cal m.

The splintering limbs from a falling tree sent the guards scurrying toward the bunker. \"Now !\" Curtis said. \"Let's go!\" I was frozen. H e jerked me to m y feet. \"We've got to m ove!\" he yelled in my ear. ,it's Finally my legs worked and we ran northeast in the same direction that May a had fled. Several more tremors reverberated under our feet and then the movements and sounds ceased. After making our way through the dark wood s for several miles, our path lighted only by the rays of the moon filtering through the foliage, we stopped and huddled in a g rove of small pines. \"Do you think they'll follow us?\" I asked Curtis. \"Yes,\" he said. \"They can 't allow any of us to get back t o town. I would guess that they still have people stationed along the paths back.\" While he was talking, a cl ear picture of the falls entered my mind. It was still pristine, undisturbed. The falling water, I real1z ed, was the landmark in Feyman's vision that I had been trying to remember. \"We have to go northwest to the falls,\" I said. Curtis nodded toward the north, and as silently as possible we headed in that direction, crossing the stream and car efully making our way toward the can yon. Periodically Curtis would stop and cove r our tracks . During a rest, we cou ld hear the low rumbling of vehicles from the southeast. After another mile we began to see the moon lit can yon walls rising up into the distance. As we approach ed the rocky mouth, Curtis led the way across the creek. S uddenly he jumped backw ard in fright as someone walked around a tree from the left. The person screamed and recoiled, almost losing balance, teetering at the edge of the creek bank. \"May al\" I yelled, realizing who it was, Curtis recove red and lunged forward and pulled her back as rocks and gravel slid into the water. She hugged him intensely and then reached out to m e. \"I don't know why I ran like that. I just panicked. I cou ld only think to head toward the falls you told me about. I just prayed that some of you would get away too.\" Leaning back ag ainst a larger tree, she took a d eep breath, then asked, \"What happened when the guard fired back t here?"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"How did those bullets miss me?

Then, in silence, I heard the distinct sound of someone walking up ahead. \"Wai t,\" I said to the others. \"Someone's up there.\" We crouched down and waited. Ten minutes went by. Then, from the trees ahead, Charlene walked up and dropped to her knees. \"Thank God I found you,\" she said. \"How did you get away?\" \"We were able to run when a tree fell,\" I said. Charlene looke d deep into m y eyes. \"I thought you might head toward the falls so I walked in this direction, although I don't know if I cou ld have found them in the dark.\" May a m otioned for us, and we all moved out to a cl earing where the creek went through the mouth of the can yon. H ere the full light of the moon illuminated the grass and the rocks to each side. \"May be we're going to have another chance,\" she said, urging us with her hands to sit down and face each other. \"What are we going to do?\" Curtis said. \"We can 't stay here long. They'll be com ing.\" I looke d at May a, thinking we should go on to the falls, but she seemed so energized that, instead, I asked, \"What do you think went wrong before?\" \"I don't know; maybe there are too f ew of us. You said there were supposed to be seven. O r perhaps there's too m uch Fear.\" Charlene leaned toward the group. \"I think we have to re VI member the energy we ach ieved when we were in the cave . We have to con nect at that level again.\" For several long minutes we all worked on our inner con nection. Finally May a said, \"We have to give each other energy, find the higher-self expression.\" I took s everal deep breaths and watched the faces of the others again. Gradually they becam e more beautiful and luminescent, and I cau ght sight of their authentic soul expression. Around us, the surrounding plants and rocks lit up even more, as though the moon 's rays had suddenly doubled. A familiar wave of love and euphoria swept through my body and I turned to see the shimmering figures of my soul group behind me. As soon as I saw them, my awareness seemed to expand even more and I realized that the soul groups of the others were in similar positions, although they had not yet merged."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"May a cau ght my eye. She was looki ng at me in a state of com plete openness and honesty, and as I watched her, it seemed as though I cou ld see her Birth Vision as a subtle expression on her face.

H er mission was clear; her backg round had prepared her perfectly. \"Feel as if the atoms in your body are vibrating at a h igher level,\" she said. I glanced at Charlene; on her face was the same clarity. She represented the information bearers, identifying and com municating the vital truths expressed by each person or group. \"Do you see what's happening?\" Charlene asked. \"We're seeing each other as we really are, at our highest level, without the emotional projections of old fears.\" \"I can see that,\" Curtis said, his face again full of energy and certainty. No on e spoke for several minutes. I closed my eyes as the energy continued to build. \"Look at that!\" Charlene suddenly said, pointing at the soul groups all around us. Each soul group was beginning to blend with the others, just as they had done at the cave . I glanced at Charlene and then at Curtis and May a. I cou ld now see on their faces an even fuller expression of who they were as participants in the long movement of human civilization. \"This is it!\" I said. \"We're reaching the next step; we're seeing tV a more com plete vision of human history.\" Before us, in a h uge hologram, appeared an image of history that seemed to stretch out from the very beginning to what appeared to be a d istant end. As I strained to focus, I realized that this was an image very similar to the one I had observed earlier while with my soul group-except that in this instance the story was beginning much earlier, with the birth of the universe itself. We watched as the first matter exploded into being and gravitated into stars that lived and died and spewed forth the great diversity of elements that ultimately formed the Ear th. These elements, in turn, com bined in the early terrestrial environment into ever-more-com plex substances until they finally leaped into or ganic life-life that then also m oved forward, into greater organization and awareness, as if guided by an ove rall plan. Mu lticelled organisms becam e fishes, and fishes progressed into am phibians, and am phibians evolved into reptiles and birds and ultimately into m ammals. As we watched, a cl ear picture of the Afterlife dimension opened up in front of us, and I understood that an aspect of each of the souls there-in fact, a p art of all of humanity-had lived through this long, slow process of evolution. We had swum as fishes, boldly crawled upon the land as am phibians, and struggled to survive as reptiles, birds, and mammals, fighting every step of the way to finally move into human form-all with intention. We knew that through wave after wave of successive generations, we would"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"be born into the physical plane, and no m atter how long it took, we would strive to wake up, and unify, and evolve, and eventually implement on Ear th the same spiritual culture that exists in the Afterlife. Certainly the journey would be difficult, even torturous. Wi th the first intuition to aw aken, we would sense the Fear of aloneness and separation. Yet we would not go back t o sleep; we would fight through the Fear, relying on the dim intuition that we weren't alone, that we were spiritual beings with a spiritual purpose on the planet. And, following the urge of evolution, we would gravitate together into larger, more com plex social groupings, differentiating into m ore diverse occu pations, ove rcom ing a n eed to defeat and con quer each other, and eventually implement a d emocratic process through which new ideas cou ld be shared and synthesized and evolved into ever-better truths. Gradually our security would com e from inside us, as we progressed from an expression of the divine in terms of nature gods to the divine as one father God outside ourselves to a f inal expression as the Holy Spirit within. sacred texts would be intuited and written, offering heartfelt symbolic expression of our relationship and future with this one deity. Visionaries from both Eas t and We st would clarify that this Holy Spirit was always there, always acce ssible, waiting only for our ability to repent, to op en, to cl ear the blocks that prevent a full com munion. Over time, we knew, our urge to unify and share would expand until we sensed a special com munity, a d eeper association with others who shared a particular geographical locat ion on the lanet, and the human world would began to solidify into political nation-states, each holding a unique viewpoint. Soon after would com e an explosion of trade and com merce. The scientific method would be instituted, and the resulting discove ries would initiate a period of economic preoccu pation and the great secular expansion known as the Industrial Revolution. And once we developed a w eb of economic relationships around the globe, we would begin to further awaken and to remember our full spiritual nature. The Insights would gradually permeate human con sciousness and we would evolve our economy into a f orm com patible with the Ear th, and, finally, begin to m ove beyond the last fearful polarization of forces toward a n ew spiritual worldview on the planet. Here I momentarily glanced at the others. Their faces told me that they had shared this vision of Ear th's history. In one brief revelation we had grasped how human con sciousness had progressed from the beginning of time right to the present moment. Suddenly the hologram focused on the polarization in great detail. All humans on the Ear th were migrating into two con flicting positions: on e pushing toward a vag ue but ever-clearer image of transformation, and the other resisting, sensing that important val ues con tained in the old view were being lost forever. We cou ld see that in the Afterlife dimension, it was known that this conflict would be our greatest challenge to the spiritualization of the physical dimension-particularly if the polarization grew extreme. In this cas e, both sides would entrench into an irrational projection of evil onto the other, or worse, might believe the literal interpreters of the end-times prophecies and begin to think the com ing future was beyond their influence and therefore give up com pletely."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"To find the Wor ld Vision and resolve the polarization, we cou ld see that our Afterlife intention was to discern the deeper P i if truths of these prophecies. As with all the Scriptures, the visions in Daniel and Revelation were divine intuitions com ing from the Afterlife into the physical plane, and so m ust be understood as draped in the symbolism of the seer's mind, much like a d ream. We would focus on the symbolic m eaning. The prophecies envisioned an eventual end to the human story on Ear th; but an end\" that, for believers, would be quite different from the one experienced by nonbelievers. Those in the latter group were seen Lo experience an end of history that would begin with great cat astrophes and environmental disasters and collapsing economies. Then, at the height of the fear and chaos, a strong leader would emerge, the Antichrist, who would offer to restore order, but only if individuals would agree to give up their liberties and car ry the \"mark of the beast\" upon their bodies in order to participate in the automated economy. Eve ntually this strong leader would declare himself a g od and take by force any cou ntry that resisted his rule, at first making war on the forces of Islam, then on the Jews and Christians, ultimately cas ting the whole world into a f iery Armageddon. For believers, on the other hand, the scriptural prophets predicted a much more pleasant end to history. Remaining true to the spirit, these believers would be given spiritual bodies and be raptured into an other dimension cal led the New Jerusalem, but would be able to go back an d forth into the physical. Eve ntually, at a ce rtain point in the war, God would fully return to end the fighting, restore the Ear th, and implement a thousand years of peace where there would be no sickness or death, and everything would be transformed, even the animals of the world, who would no longer eat meat. Instead, \"The wolf shall dwell with the lamb ... an d the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\" May a an d Curtis cau ght my eye, and then Charlene looke d up; we all seemed to sense, at once, the cor e meaning of the prophecies. Wh at the end-times seers were receiving was an intuition that in our time, two distinctive futures would be opening before us. We cou ld choose either to languish in the Fear, believing that the world is moving into a Bi g Brother style of automation and social decay and ultimate destruction . or we cou ld follow the other path and con sider ourselves the believers who can ove rcom e this nihilism and open to the higher vibrations of love, where we are spared the apocal ypse and can enter a n ew dimension in which we invite the spirit, through us, to cr eate P, just the utopia the scriptural prophets envisioned. E Now we cou ld see why those in the Afterlife felt that our interpretation of these prophecies was key to resolving the polarization. If we decide that these Scriptures mean that the destruction of the world is inevitable, written unalterably into God's plan, the effect of such a belief would be to cr eate this very outcom e."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Clearly we had to ch oose the path of love and believing. As I had seen earlier, the polarization was not intended to be so severe. It was known in the Afterlife that each side represented a p art of the truth that cou ld be integrated and synthesized into the new, spiritual worldview. Further, I saw that this synthesis would be a n atural outgrowth of the Insights themselves, especially the Tenth Insight, and of the special groups that would begin to form all ove r the world. Suddenly the hologram raced forward and I felt another expansion of consciousness. I knew that we were now moving into the next step of the process: the act ual remembrance of how we intended to becom e believers and accom plish this prophesied utopian future. We were finally remembering the Wor ld Vision! As we watched, we first saw the Tenth Insight groups forming all ove r the planet, reaching a cr itical mass of energy, and then learning to project this energy in such a w ay that the entrenched sides of the polarization immediately began to lighten and ease, overcom ing the Fear. Es pecially affected would be the technological controllers, who would remember themselves and give up their last efforts to m anipulate the economy and seize power. The result of the projected energy would be an unprecedented wave of awakening and remembrance and coop eration and personal involvement, and a vi rtual explosion of newly inspired individuals, all of whom would begin to fully recall their Birth Visions and follow their synchronistic path into exactly the right positions within their culture. The scene shifted to images of decaying inner cities and forgotten rural families. H ere we cou ld see a n ew con sensus forming on how to intervene in the cycle of poverty. No l onger would intervention be con ceived in terms of government programs or merely in terms of education and jobs; the new approach would be deeply spiritual, for the structures of education were already in place; what was missing was the ability to break f ree from the Fear and to ove rcom e the hellish diversions set up to ward off the anxiety of poverty. In this regard I saw a sudden surge of private outreach surrounding each family and each child in need. Wave s of individuals began to form personal relationships, beginning with those who saw the family every day-merchants, teachers, police officers on the beat, ministers. This contact was then expanded by other vol unteers working as \"big brothers...... b ig sisters,\" and tutors-all guided by their inner intuitions to help, remembering their intention to m ake a d ifference with one family, one child. And all car rying the con tagion of the Insights and the crucial message that no m atter how tough the situation, or how entrenched the self-defeating habits, each of us can wake up to a m emory of mission and purpose. As this con tagion con tinued, incidents of violent crime began mysteriously to decrease acr oss human culture; for, as we saw clearly, the roots of violence are always frustration and passion and fear scripts that dehumanize the victim, and a g rowing interaction with those carrying a h igher awareness was now beginning to disrupt this mind-set. We saw a n ew con sensus emerging toward crime that drew from both"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"traditional and human-potential ideas. In the short run, there would be a need for new prisons and detention facilities, as the traditional truth was recognized that returning offenders to the com munity too s oon , or leniently letting perpetrators go in order to give them another chance, reinforced the behavior. Yet, at the same time, we saw an integration of the Insights into the actual operation of these facilities, introducing a w ave of pried Milvate involvement with those incarcerated, shifting the crime culture and initiating the only rehabilitation that works: the con tagion of remembering. Simultaneously, as increasingly more people awakened, I saw millions of individuals taking the time to intervene in con flict at every level of human culture-for we all were reaching a n ew understanding of what was at stake. In every situation where a h usband or wife grew angry and lashed out at the other, or where addictive com pulsions or a d esperate need for approval led a y outhful gang member to ki ll, or where people felt so restricted in their lives that they embezzled or defrauded or manipulated others for gain; in all these situations, there was someone perfectly placed to have prevented the violence but who had failed to act. Surrounding this potential hero were perhaps dozens of other friends and acquaintances who had likewise failed, because the y didn't con vey the information and ideas that would have created the wider support system for the intervention to have taken place. In the past perhaps, this failure cou ld have been rationalized, but no longer. Now the Tenth Insight was emerging and we knew that the people in our lives were probably souls with whom we had had long relationships over many lifetimes, and who were now cou nting on our help. So we are com pelled to act , com pelled to be cou rageous. Non e of us wants to have failure on our con science, or have to bear a torturous Life Review in which we must watch the tragic con sequences of our timidity. As the scenes rushed past, we saw this burgeoning awareness motivating activity toward other social problems as well. We cou ld see an image of the world's rivers and oce ans, and again I observed a synthesis of the old and new which, while admitting the often cap ricious behavior of government bureaucracy, also raised to a n ew level of priority the human desire to safeguard the environment, initiating a surge of private intervention. The wisdom was emerging that, as with the problem of poverty and violence, the crime of pollution always has com pliant bystanders. People who would never con sciously pollute the environment themselves worked with or knew about others whose projects or business practices damaged the planet's biosphere. These were the people who in the past had said nothing, perhaps because of job insecurity or because they felt alone in their opinion. Yet now, as they awakened and realized they were in exactly the right position to take act ion, we watched them rally public op inion against the polluters-whether it was the dumping of industrial wastes into the oce an in the dead of night, venting excess oil from a tanker far at sea, secretly using banned insecticides on com mercial vegetable plots, leaving the scrubbers off at an industrial plant between inspections, or faking the research on the dangers of a n ew chemical. No m atter what the crime, now there would be inspired witnesses who would feel"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":",all the support of grassroots organizations offering rewards for such information, and who would take their can icorders and expose the crime themselves. Similarly we observed the environmental practices of governments themselves being exposed, especially regarding policies toward public lands. For years, it would. be discove red, governmental agencies had sold mining and logong rights on some of the most sacred places on Earth, at below-market rates, as political favor s and paybacks . Maj estic, cat hedral forests, belonging to the public, had been unbelievably pillaged and clear-cut in the name of proper forest management-as though planting rows of pine trees would replace the diversity of life, and energies, inherent in a h ardwood forest that had matured for centuries. Yet it would be the emerging spiritual awareness that would finally force an end to such disgrace, We watched a n ew coal ition forming, made up of old-view hunters arild nostalgic history buffs and those who perceived the natural sites as sacred portals. This coal ition would finally sound the alarm that would save the few remaining virgin forests in Europe and Nor th America, and begin to protect on a larger scale the essential rain forests in the tropical regions of the world. It would be com monly understood that every remaining site of beauty must be saved for the benefit of future generations. Cultivated plant fibers would replace the use of trees for lumber and paper, and the remainin public land would all be protected from exploitation and used to supply the exploding demand to vi sit such unspoiled and energizing areas of nature. At the same time, as intuition and awareness and remembering expanded, the developed cultures would finally turn to the native peoples of the world with a n ew respect and ap predation, eager to integrate a m ystical redefinition of the natural world. The holographic scene moved forward again, and I cou ld see the wave of spiritual con tagion permeating every aspect of culture. just as Charlene had foreseen earlier, every occu pational group was beginning consciously to shift its customary practice toward a m ore intuitive and ideal level of functioning, finding its spiritual role, its vision of true service. Medicine, led by individual practitioners who focused on the I genesis of disease, was moving from the spiritual/psychologica m echanical treatment of symptoms toward prevention. We cou ld from the self-serving methods of see the legal profession moving fr creatin con flict, and obscuring truth in order to win, into its true role of resolving con flict in the most \"win-win\" manner possible. And just as Curtis had seen, everyone involved in business, industry by industry, was shifting into an enlightened cap italism, a cap italism oriented not just to profits, but to filling the evolving needs of spiritual beings, and making these products avai lable at the lowest possible prices. This new business ethic would produce a g rassroots deflation, initiating a systematic evolution ward an eventual full"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"automation-and ultimately the free to avai lability-of the basic necessities of life, liberating humans to sioned in the Ninth engage in the spiritual \"tithe\" economy envied Insight. As we con tinued to watch, the scenes acce lerated forward, and we cou ld see individuals remembering their spiritual missions at increasingly younger ages. H ere we cou ld see the precise understanding that would soon embody the new spiritual worldview. individuals would com e of age and remember themselves as souls born from one dimension of existence into an other. Alion would be expected, though memory loss during the transit recapturing pre- life memory would becom e an important early goal of education. As youths, our teachers would first guide us through the early experience of synchronicity; urge us to identify our intuitions to study certain subjects, to vi sit particular places, always looki ng for higher answers as to why we were pursuing these particular n paths. As the full memory of the Insights emerged, we would find ourselves involved with certain groups, working on particular ects, bringing in our full vision of what we had wanted t do. A nd finally we would recove r the underlying intention behind our lives. We would know that we cam e here to raise the vibratory level of this planet, to discove r and protect the beauty and energy of its natural sites, and to ensure that all humans had acce ss to these special locat ions, so that we cou ld con tinue to increase our energy, ultimately instituting the Afterlife culture here in the physical. Such a w orldview would especially shift the way we looke d at other people. No l onger would we see human beings merely in the racial dress or national origin of one particular lifetime. Instead, we would see others as brother or sister souls, engaged, like us, in a p rocess of com ing awake and of spiritualizing the planet. It would becom e known that the settling of certain souls into var ious geographical locat ions on the planet had occu rred with great meaning. Each nation was, in fact, an enclave of specific spiritual information, shared and modeled by its citizens, information waiting to be learned and integrated. As I watched the future unfold, I cou ld see that a w orld political unity, envisioned by so m any, was finally being ach ievednot by forcing all nations into subservience to on e political body, but rather through a grassroots ackn owledgment of our spiritual Similarities while treasuring our local autonomy and cultural differences. As with individuals i riteracting in a g roup, each member of the family of nations was being recognized for this culture truth represented to the world at large. Be fore us, we saw Ear th's political struggles, so of ten violent, shifting into a w ar of words. As the tide of remembrance con tinued to sweep the planet, all humans began to understand that our destiny was to discuss and com pare the perspectives of our relative religions and, while honoring the best of their individual doctrines at the personal level, ultimately to see that each religion supplemented the others and to integrate them into a"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"synthesized global spirituality. We cou ld see clearly that these dialogues would result in the rebuilding of a g rand temple in Jerusalem, jointly occu pied by all the ma or religions-Jewish, Christian, Islamic, Eas tern, even the j de facto religion of secular idealism, represented by those economic enclaves in China an d Europe who thought primarily in terms of a pantheistic economic utopia. H ere, ultimate spiritual perspective would be debated and discussed. And in this war of words and energy, at first the Islamic an d the Jewish perspectives would hold center stage, then the Christian perspective would be com pared and integrated, along with the inner vision of the Eas tern religions. We saw the awareness of humanity entering another level, with the collective human culture progressing from primarily the sharing of economic information to the synchronistic exchange of spiritual truths. As this occu rred, certain individuals and groups would begin to reach levels approach ing that of the Afterlife dimension and would disappear to the larger majority remaining on Ear th. These select groups would walk intentionally into the other dimension, yet would learn to go back and forthjust as the Ninth Insight predicts and the scriptural prophets saw. Yet, after this Rapture began, those left on Ear th would under 77777771, stand what was occu rring and acce pt their role in remaining in the physical, knowing that they would soon follow. Now it was time for the secular idealists to proclaim their truths on the temple steps. At first their energetic thrust into Jerusalem would com e from Europe with its primarily secular vision, with one strong leader proclaiming the spiritual importance of secular matters. This perspective would be met strongly by the determined \"otherworldly\" spiritualism of the Muslims and the Christians. Bu t then this con flict of energy would be mediated and later synthesized into on e by the inner spiritual emphasis of the Eas tern perspective. By then, the last attempts of the con trollers, who had once con spired to cr eate a tyrannical society of chips and robots and forced com pliance, would have been won ove r by the con tagion of awakening. And this last synthesis would open everyone to the final infusion of the Holy Spirit. We saw clearly that through this Middle Eas tern dialogue of energy integration, history had fulfilled the scriptural prophecies in a symbolic an d verbal manner, avoi ding the physical apocal ypse expected by the literalists. Suddenly our focus shifted to the Afterlife dimension, and here we cou ld see with great clarity that our intention all along was not merely to create a Ne w Ear th, but a Ne w Heaven as well. We watched as the effect of the Wor ld Vision remembrance transformed not only the physical dimension but also the Afterlife. During the raptures on Ear th, the soul groups would also have been rapturing toward the physical, com pleting the transfer of energy into the expanded physical dimension. Here the full reality of what was happening in the historical process becam e apparent. From the beginning of time, as our memory opened, energy and knowledge had systematically moved from the Afterlife dimension into the physical. At first, the soul groups in the Afterlife had borne full responsibility for maintaining the intention and envisioning the future, helping us to recall what we wanted to do, giving us energy."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Then, as con sciousness on Ear th progressed and the population increased, the balance of energy and responsibility had slowly shifted toward the physical dimension, until, at this point in history, when enough energy had shifted and the Wor ld Vision was being remembered, the full power and responsibility for believing and creating the intended future would be shifting from the Afterlife to the souls on Ear th, to the newly forming groups, to us! At this point, we have to car ry the intent. And that's why it now fell to us to resolve the polarization and to help shift the particular individuals, right here in this val ley, who were still cau ght in the Fear and who felt justified in manipulating the economy for their own purposes, justified in seizing con trol of the future. At exactly the same time, all four of us glanced at each other in the darkness, the hologram still surrounding us, the soul groups still merged in the backg round, glowing brightly. Then I noticed a h uge hawk fly onto a l imb ten feet above the group and gaze down at us. Be neath it, less than five feet away, a rabbit hopped to within three feet of my right elbow and stopped, followed seconds later by a b obcat, who sat directly beside it. Wh at was happening? Abruptly a silent vibration tingled my solar plexus; the experiment had been reactivated! \"Look ove r there!\" Curtis yelled. Fifty yards away, barely distinguishable in the moon light, was a n arrow fissure, shaking the bushes and small trees, extending slowly in our direction. I looke d at the others. \"It's up to us now,\" May a shouted. \"We have enough of the Vision now; we can stop them.\" Before we cou ld act , the earth under us shook vi olently and the fissure acce lerated toward us. Simultaneously several vehicles pulled to a s top in the underbrush, their lights shining through fuzzy silhouettes made by the trees and dust. Un afraid, I maintained my energy and focused again on the hologram. \"The Vision will stop them,\" May a yelled again. \"Don't let the Vision go! Hold it!\" Embracing the image of the future before us, I again felt the group marshal energy toward Feyman, as if holding our intention like a g iant wall against his intrusion, imaging his group being pushed back b y the energy, fleeing in terror. I glanced at the crevice still racing toward us, con fident it would soon stop. It acce lerated instead. Another tree fell. Then another. As it sped into the group, I lost my con centration and rolled backw ard, choking on the dust. \"It's still not working!\" I heard Curtis yell. I felt as if it was all happening again. \"Up this way,\" I shouted, struggling to see in the sudden darkness. As I ran, I cou ld barely make out the dim outlines of the others; they were veering away from me to the east."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"I climbed up the stony ridge that formed the left wall of the can yon and didn't stop until I was a h undred yards away. Kneeling in the rocks , I looke d out into the night. Not hing moved, but I cou ld hear Feyman's men talking at the can yon entrance. Q uietly I made my way farther up the slope, angling northwest, still watching car efully for any sign of the others. Finally I found a w ay to cl imb down to the can yon floor again. Still no m ovement anywhere. Then, as I began to walk north again, someone suddenly grabbed me from behind. \"What-\" I yelled. \"Shssssssss,\" a voi ce whispered. \"Be quiet. It's David.\" I'VE HOLDING THE VISION turned and looke d at him in the moon light, observing the long hair, the scarred face. \"Where are the others?\" he whispered. \"We were separated,\" I replied. \"Did you see what happened?\" He moved his face closer. \"Yes, I was watching from the hill. Where do you think they'll go?\" I thought for a m oment. \"They'll head toward the falls.\" He motioned for me to follow and we started in that direction. After several minutes had passed, he glanced back as he walked and said, \"When you were sitting together at the entrance back t here, your energy pooled, and then swelled far out into the val ley. Wh at were you doing?\" In an attempt to explain, I summarized the whole story: finding Wil and entering the other dimension; seeing Williams and runnin into Joel and May a; and especially meeting Curtis and trying to bring in the Wor ld Vision to defeat Feyman. \"Curtis was back t here with you at the mouth of the can yon?\" David asked. \"Yes, and May a an d Charlene, although I think there are supposed to be seven of us . . .\" He gave me another quick g lance, almost chuckling. All of the tense, pent-up anger he had displayed in town seemed to have com pletely disappeared. \"So you found the ancestors too, didn't you?\" I hurried up to walk beside him. \"You reached the other dimension?\" \"Yes, I saw my soul group and witnessed my Birth Vision, and just as you, I remembered what happened before, that we've all com e back t o bring in the Wor ld Vision. And then-I don't know how-when I was"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"watching all of you back t here in the moon light, it was as if I was with you, was part of your group. I saw the Wor ld Vision around me.\" He had stopped in the shadow of a large tree that blocke d the moon , his face rigid and cas t back. I turned to face him. \"David, when the group of us were together back there, and we brought in the Wor ld Vision, why didn't it stop Feyman?\" He moved forward into the light and immediately I recognized him as the angry chief who had rebuked May a. T hen his rock-h ard expression shifted and he burst out laughing. \"The key aspect of this Vision,\" he said, \"is not the mere experience of it, although that's hard enough. It's how we project this Vision of the future, how we hold it for the rest of humanity. That's what the Tenth Insight is really all about. You didn't hold the Vision for Feyman and the others in a w ay that would help them wake up.\" He looke d at me a m oment longer, then said, \"Come on, we have to hurry.\" After we had traveled perhaps half a m ile, a b ird of some kind cried out toward our right, and David stopped abruptly \"What was that?\" I asked. He cocke d his head as the cry again filled the night. \"That's a screech owl, signaling the others that we are here.\" I gave him a b lank expression, remembering how strange the animals had been act ing ever since I arrived in the val ley. \"Does anyone in that group know the animal signs?\" he asked. I don't know; maybe Curtis?\" \"No, he's too s cientific.\" I then remembered that May a had mentioned following the sounds of birds when she had found us in the cave . \"Perhaps May a!\" He looke d at me questioningly. \"The physician you mentioned, who uses visualization in her work?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good . That's perfect. Let's do what she does and pray.\" I turned and looke d at him as the owl cried out again. \"What? \"Let' s . . . vi sualize . . . t hat she remembers the gift of the animals.\" \"What is the gift of the animals?\" A trace of anger flashed acr oss his face, and he paused for a m oment, closing his eyes, obviously trying to shake off the emotion. \"Haven't you understood that when an animal shows up in our lives, it is a coi ncidence of the highest order?\""},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"A I told him about the rabbit and the flock of crows and the hawk, which had shown up as I had first entered the val ley, and then about the bobcat cub, the eagle, and the young wolf that had appeared later. \"Some of them even showed up when we saw the Wor ld Vision.\" He nodded expectantly \"I knew something significant was happening,\" I said, \"but I didn't know exactly what to do except to follow some of them. Are you saying that all these animals had a m essage for me?\" \"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.\" \"How do I know what the message is?\" \"It's easy. You know because of the particular kind of animal you are attracting at any one time. Each species that crosses our paths tells us something about our situation, what part of ourselves we must cal l upon to handle the circumstances we face.\" \"Even after everything that's happened,\" I said, \"that's hard to believe. A biologist would say animals are primarily robots, operating on dumb instinct.\" \"Only because animals reflect our own level of con sciousness and expectation. If our level of vibration is low, the animals will merely be there with us, performing their usual ecological functions. Wh en a skeptical biologist reduces animal behavior to m indless instinct, he sees the restriction that he himself has put upon the animal. Bu t as our vibration shifts, the act ions of the animals that com e to us becom e ever more synchronistic, mysterious, and instructional.\" I just stared. Squinting, he said, \"The hare that you saw was pointing out a d irection for you both physically and emotionally. Wh en I talked to you in town, you seemed depressed and fearful, as though you were losing faith in the Insights. If you watch a w ild rabbit for a long time, you can perceive that it models how to really face our fear, so that we can later move past it into cr eativity and abundance. A rabbit lives in close proximity to an imals that feed on it, but it handles the fear and stays there and is still very fertile and productive and lipbeat- Wh en a rabbit appears in our lives, it is a signal to find the same attitude within ourselves. This was the message to you; its presence meant you had the opportunity to remember the medicine of rabbit and to fully look at your own fear and move byond. And because it occu rred during the beginning of your trip, it set the tone of your whole adventure. H asn't your trip beeri both fearful and abundant?\" I nodded. He added, \"Sometimes it means that the abundance can be of a romantic nature too. H ave you met anyone?\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"I shrugged, remembering the new energy I had felt with Charlene. \"May be, in a w ay. NA rhat about the crows I saw and the hawk that I followed when I found Wil?\" \"Crows are the holders of the laws of spirit. Spend time with crows and they will do am azin things that always increase our perception of spiritual reality. Teir message was to op en up, to remember the spiritual laws that were presenting themselves to you in this val ley. Seeing them should have prepared you for what was to com e.\" \"And the hawk?\" \"Hawks are alert, and observant, ever vigilant for the next bit of information, the next rnessag- Their presence means that it is important at that time to increase' our alertness. O ften they signal that a messenger is close.\" He cccke d his head. \"You mean, it was foretelling the presence of Wil?\" \"Yes. David went on to explain why the other animals I had seen had been drawn my way. Cats, he told me, implore us to remember our ability to intuit and to elf-heal. The bobcat cub's message, arriving as it did, just before meeting May a, was to signal that an opportunity to heal was near. Similarly an eagle soars to great heights, and represents an opportunity to act ually venture into the higher realms of the spirit world. Wh en I saw the eagle on the ridge, David said, I should have prepared for seeing my soul group and for understanding more of my own destiny. Lastly, he told me, the young wolf was there to energize and awaken my latent instinct for cou rage and my ability to teach, so that I might find the words to help bring together the other members of the group. \"so the animals represent,\" I said, \"parts of ourselves we need to get in touch with.\" \"Yes, aspects of ourselves that we developed when we were those animals during the cou rse of evolution, but have lost.\" I thought of the vision of evolution I had witnessed at the can yon entrance with the group. \"You're speaking of the way life progressed forward, species by species?\" \"We were there,\" David con tinued. \"Our con sciousness moved through each animal as it represented the end point of life's development and then leaped to the next. We experienced the way each species views the world, which is an important aspect of the com plete spiritual consciousness. Wh en a p articular animal com es around, that means we're ready to integrate its con sciousness into ou r waking awareness again. And I'll tell you something: there are some species that we aren't even close to cat ching up with. That's why it's so important to preserve every life-form on this Ear th. We want them to endure not just because they are a p art of the balanced ecosphere, but because they represent aspects of ourselves that we're still trying to remember.\" He paused for a m oment, looki ng out into the night. \"This is also true of the rich diversity of human thought, represented by the var ious cultures around the planet. Non e of us"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"knows exactly where the current truth of human evolution resides. Each culture around the world has a slightly different worldview, a particular mode of awareness, and it takes the best of all cultures, integrated together, to m ake a m ore ideal whole.\" An expression of sadness crossed his face. \"It's too b ad that four hundred years had to pass before the real integration of the European and Nat ive cultures cou ld begin. Think of what has happened. The Western mind lost touch with the mystery and reduced the magic of the deep wood s to lumber and the mystery of wildlife to pretty animals. Urbanization has isolated the great majority of people, so we now think a journey into nature is a stroll on the golf cou rse. Do you realize how few of us have experienced the mysteries of the wilderness? \"Our Nat ional Parks represent all that is left of the great cat hedral forests and rich plains and high deserts that once characterized this continent. There are too m any of us now for the wild areas that still exist. In many parks there are waiting lists ove r a y ear long. And still, the politicians seem bent on selling off more and more of the public lands. Mos t of us are forced to draw from decks of animal car ds to see what animal signs are com ing into ou r lives, instead of being able to take quests into the truly wild areas of the world to experience the real thing.\" Suddenly the screech owl's cry erupted so cl ose that the sound made me jump involuntarily. David was squinting impatiently. \"Can we pray now?\" \"Listen,\" I said, \"I don't know what you mean. Do you want to pray or visualize?\" He tried to cal m his voi ce. \"Yes, I'm sorry. Impatience seems to be a residual emotion I have with you.\" He took a b reath. \"The Tenth Insight-learning to have faith in our intuitions, remembering our birth intention, holding the Wor ld Vision-all of it is about understanding the essence of real prayer. \"Why does every religious tradition assume a form of prayer? if God is the one, all-knowing, all-powerful God, then why would we have to beseech his help or impel him to do something? Wh y wouldn't he just set up com mandments and cove nants and judge us accor dingly, taking direct act ion when he wanted to, not us? Wh y would we have to as k for his special intervention? The answer is that when we pray in the correct fashion, we are not asking God to do something. G od is inspiring us to act in his place to enact his will on the Ear th. We are the emissaries of the divine on this planet. True prayer is the method, the visualization, that God expects us to use in discerning his will and implementing it in the physical dimension. H is kingdom com e, his will be done, on Ear th, as it is in heaven. \"In this sense, every thought, every expectation-all of what we visualize happening in the future-is a p rayer, and tends to cr eate that very future. Bu t no thought or desire or fear is as strong as a vi sion that is in alignment with the divine. That's why bringing in the Wor ld Vision, and holding it, is important: so we will know what to pray for, what future to vi sualize.\" \"I understand,\" I said. \"How do we help May a becom e aware of the owl?\" \"What did she say to do when she talked to you about healing?\""},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"\"She said we should visualize patients remembering what they intended to do with their lives but still hadn't done. She said that real healing springs from a renewed sense of what one wants to do on ce health is regained. Wh en they remember, then we can also join them in holding this more specific plan.\" \"Let's do the same now,\" David said. \"Hopefully, her original intention was to follow the sound of this bird.\" David closed his eyes, and I followed his lead, trying to vi sualize an image of May a aw akening to what she was supposed to do. A fter a few minutes I opened my eyes and David was stanng at me. The owl screamed again right above our heads. \"Let's go,\" he said. Twenty minutes later we were standing on the hill above the falls. The owl had followed, cal ling out periodically, and had stationed itself fifty feet to ou r right. In front of us, the pool glistened in the moon light, muted only by wisps of fog that drifted along its surface. We waited for ten or fifteen minutes without speaking. \"Look! There!\" David said, pointing. Among the rocks to the right of the pool I cou ld make out several figures. O ne of them looke d up and saw us; it was Charlene. I waved and she recognized me. Then David and I made our way down the rocky slope to where they were standing. Curtis was ecstatic at seeing David, grabbing his arm. \"We'll stop these people now.\" For a m oment they looke d at each other in silence, then Curtis introduced May a an d Charlene. I met eyes with May a. \" Did you have any trouble finding your way here?\" \"At first, we were con fused and lost in the darkness, but then I heard the owl and I knew.\" \"The presence of an owl,\" David said, \"means that we have the opportunity to see through any possible deception by others, and if we avoi d the tendency to harm or lash out, we can , like the owl, cut through the darkness to hold a h igher truth.\" May a was watching David closely. ,you look f amiliar,\" May a said. \"Who ar e you?\" \"You were told my name. It's He looke d at her questioningly. David.\" \"No, I mean who ar e you to m e She grabbed his hand gently. to us?\" \"I was there,\" he said, \"during the wars, but I was so full of hatred for the whites that I didn't support you; I didn't even"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"listen to you.\" \"We're doing it differently now,\" I said. David glared at me reflexively, then cau ght himself and softened, as he had before. \"Back i n that war, I had even less respect for you than the others. You wouldn't take a stand. You ran away.\" \"It was fear,\" I replied. ,I know.\" For several more minutes everyone talked with David about the emotions we were feeling, discussing everything we cou ld remember about the tragedy of the war on the Nat ive Americans. David went on to explain that his soul group was made up of mediators and that he had com e this time to work through his anger at the European mentality, and then to work for the spiritual recognition of all indigenous cultures and the inclusion of all people. \"You're the Charlene glanced at me, then turned to David. fifth member of this group, aren't you?\" Before he cou ld answer, we felt a vi bration racing through the ground under our feet; it sent irregular ripples acr oss the surface r was another eerie melodiof the pool. Accom panying the tremo ou s whine that filled the forest. ou t of the cor ner of my eye I saw feet above us. flashlights moving on the hill fifty \"They're here!\" Curtis whispered. I turned to see Feyman at the edge of an ove rhang directly above our heads; he was adjusting a small dish antenna on what looke d like a portable com puter. \"They're going to focus on us and try to fine-tune the generator that way,\" Curtis said. \"We've got to get out of here.\" May a reached ove r and touched his arm. \"No, please, Curtis, maybe it will work this time.\" David moved closer to Curtis, then said lowly, \"it can work.\" Curtis stared at him for a m oment, then finally nodded his agreement, and we began to raise our energy again. As in the two previous attempts, I began to see higher-self expressions on every face, and then our soul groups appeared and merged into a ci rcle around us, including for the first time the members of David's group. As the memory of the Wor ld Vision returned, we were again pulled into the ove rall intent to transfer energy and knowledge and awareness into the physical dimension."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Also, as before, we saw the fearful polarization occu rring in our time, and the panoramic vision of the positive future that would succeed it once the special groups formed and learned how to intercede, how to hold the Vision. Suddenly another tremor shook t he ground violently. \"Stay with the Vision,\" May a shouted. \"Hold the image of how the future can be.\" I heard a fissure tear through the ground to m y right, but I kept my concentration. In my mind I again saw the Wor ld Vision as a force of energy that was emanating outward from our group in all directions and pushing Feyman back aw ay from us, defeating the energy of his Fear vision. To m y left, a h uge tree ripped from its roots and crashed to the ground. \"It's still not working,\" Curtis shouted, jumping to his feet. \"No, wait,\" David said. H e had been deep in thought, and now he reached out and grabbed Curtis, pulling him down bee what's wrong?! We 're treating Feyman side him. \"Don't you se and the others as if they are enemies, trying to push them back. Doing that act ually strengthens them, because they have something to fight against. Rather than fighting them with the Vision, we have to include Feyman and the operatives in what we're visualizing. In reality, there are no enemies; we're all souls in growth, waking up. We have to project the Wor ld Vision toward them as though they are just like us.\" I suddenly recalled seeing Feyman's Birth Vision. Now it all made perfect sense: the view of Hell, understanding the obsessive and off fear, seeing the ring of trance states that humans use to w souls as they tried to intervene. And then observing Feyman's original intention. \"He is one of us!\" I shouted. \"I know what he intended to do! ed for power; he In act uality, he cam e to break t hrough his the wanted to prevent the destruction that cou ld be cau sed by the and the other new technology. H e saw himself meetgenerators ing with us in the darkness. H e's the sixth member of this group.\" ks just like in the process of May a leaned forward. \"This wor healing. We have to image him remembering what he is really here to do.\" She glanced at me. \"That helps break t he fear block, the trance, at every level.\" As we began to con centrate on including Feynian and his our energy leaped forward. The night becam e illuminated men, could clearly see Feyman and two m en on the hill. The and we co s oul groups seemed to m ove more closely into focus, appearing more humanlike, while at the same time we becam e more luminescent, like them. From the left, more soul groups seemed to be joining. \"It's Feyman's soul group!\" Charlene said. \"And the soul groups of the two m en with him!\""},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"As the energy increased, the massive hologram of the Wor ld Vision again encircled us. \"Focus on Feynian and the others the way we focused on each other,\" May a shouted. \"Visualize that they remember.\" I turned slightly and faced the three men. Feyman was still working furiously at his com puter, the other two m en looki ng on. The hologram encircled them as well, especially the image of each person awakening at this historical moment to his or her true purpose. As we watched, the forest was cas t in a p erceptible field of swirling, am ber energy, which seemed to pass through Feyman and his associates. Simultaneously I saw the same wisps of white light that had protected Curtis and May a an d me hovering ove r the men, and afterward the white streaks of light grew in size and began to emanate outward in all directions, disappearing finally into the distance. After a few minutes the ground tremors and strange sounds stopped. A breeze blew the last of the dust toward the south. One of the men stopped watching Feyman and eased away from us into the trees. For several seconds Feyman con tinued to work on his keyboard, then gave up in frustration. H e looke d down at us and picked up the com puter, cradling it gently with his left arm. Wi th the other hand, he pulled out a h andgun and began to walk ou r way. The other man, armed with an automatic weapon, followed. \"Don't let go of the image,\" May a cau tioned. When they were twenty feet away, Feynian set the com puter down and punched at the keyboard again, keeping the pistol ready. Several large rocks , loosened earlier, broke free and crashed into the pool. \"You didn't com e here to do this,\" Charlene said softly. The rest of us focused on his face. The operative, keeping his weapon aimed at us, walked closer to Feyman and said, \"We can 't do an ything else here. Let's go.\" Feyman waved him off, then began to type angrily again. \"Nothing is working,\" Feyman yelled at us. \"What are you doing?\" He looke d at the operative. \"Shoot them!\" he screamed. \"Shoot them!\" tant the man looke d at us col dly. Then, shaking his For an ins head, he backe d away and disappeared into the rocks . \"You were born to prevent this destruction from happening,\" I said. He dropped the gun to his side and stared at me. For an instant his face lightened, appearing exactly as I had seen it during his Birth Vision. I cou ld tell he was remembering something. Seconds later a look of fright swept acr oss his face, turning quickly into an ger. H e grimaced and held his stomach, then turned and retched onto the rocks beside him. Wiping his mouth, he raised the gun again. \"I don't know what you're"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"trying to do to m e, but it won't work.\" He took s everal steps forward, then seemed to lose energy. The gun fell to the ground. \"It doesn't matter, you know? There are other forests. You people can 't be at all of them. I'm going to m ake this generator work. D o you understand? You're not taking this away from me!\" e stumbled backw ard a few feet, then turned and ran into H the darkness. When we reached the hill above the bunker, a g reat wave of relief swept through the group. After Feyman had left, we had cautiously made our way back t o the site of the experiment, not knowing what we would find. Now , as we looke d, the bunker area was aglow with dozens of truck l ights. Mos t of the vehicles bore the insignia of the Forest Service, although the FBI was represented, along with the local Sheriff's Department. I crawled forward several more feet on the crest of the hill and looke d closely to see if anyone was being interrogated or held in any of the cars. They all looke d empty. The door of the bunker was open and officers seemed to be going in and out as if investigating a cr ime scene. \"They've all left,\" Curtis said, leaning forward on his knees and gazing past the trunk of a large tree. \"We stopped them.\" May a turned and sat down. \"Well, at least we stopped them here. They won't try the experiment again in this val ley.\" \"But Feyman was right,\" David said, looki ng at the rest of us. \"They can go to some other place, and no on e will know.\" He stood up. \"I've got to go in there. I'll tell them the whole story.\" \"Are you crazy?\" Curtis said, walking up to him. \"What if the government is part of this?\" \"The government is just people,\" David replied. \"Not all of them are involved.\" Curtis stepped up closer. \"There has to be another way. I'm not letting you go in there.\" \"There will be someone in one of those agencies who will listen to us,\" David said. \"I'm sure of it.\" Curtis was silent. Charlene was leaning on a rock s everal feet away, and said, \"He's right. Someone cou ld be in just the right position to help.\" Curtis shook h is head, grappling with his thoughts. \"That might be true, but you'll need someone with you who can accu rately describe the technology. . . \"That means you'll have to go too,\" David said. Curtis managed to return a smile. \"Okay, I'll go with you but only because we have an ace in the hole.\""},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"What?\" David asked. \"A guy that we left tied up back i n a cave .\" David put a h and on his shoulder. \"Come on, you can tell me about it on the way. Let's see what happens.\" After anxious good -byes to the rest of us, they moved away to the right to ap proach the bunker site from another direction. Suddenly May a whispered loudly for them to wait. \"I'm going too,\" she said. \"I'm a p hysician; people know in e in the area. Y ou might need a third witness.\" The three of them looke d at Charlene and me, obviously wondering if we might join them as well. \"Not me,\" Charlene said. \"I think I'm needed elsewhere.\" I also declined and asked them not to m ention us. They agreed and then walked away toward the lights. Left alone, Charlene and I met eyes. I recalled the deep feeling I had experienced toward her in the other dimension. She was taking a step toward me, about to speak, when both of us detected a flashlight fifty yards to ou r right. Carefully we moved deeper into the trees. The light changed ion and headed right toward us. We kept still and low t the ground. As the light approach ed, I began to hear a lone voi ce, someone apparently talking to himself. I knew this person; it was Joel. I cau ght Charlene's eye. \"I know who it is,\" I whispered. \"I think we should talk to him.\" She nodded. When he was twenty feet away, I cal led out his name. He stopped and shined his light toward us. Recognizing me immediately, he walked ove r and crouched down where we were, \"What are you doing out here?\" I asked. \"There's not much left back t here,\" he replied, pointing Elk toward the bunker. \"There's an underground laboratory ove r there that has been com pletely cleaned out. I thought I would try to go to the falls; but when I got out there in the dark I changed my mind.\" \"I thought you were leaving the area,\" I said. \"You were so skeptical. \"I know. I was going to leave, but I . w ell, I had a d ream that disturbed me. I thought I'd better stay and try to help. The Forest Service people thought I was crazy, but then I ran into a d eputy from the cou nty Sheriff's Department. Someone had sent him a m essage, so we cam e out here together. That's when we found this laboratory.\" Charlene and I looke d at each other, then I briefly told Joel about the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"confrontation with Feyman and the eventual outcom e. \"They were creating that much damage?\" Joel asked. \"Was anyone hurt?\" \"I don't think so,\" I replied. \"We were lucky.\" \"And how long ago did your friends go down there?\" \"Just a few minutes ago.\" He looke d at both of us. \"You're not going in yourselves?\" I shook m y head. \"I thought it would be better if we watched how the authorities handle all this, without their knowing.\" Charlene's expression con firmed that she felt the same way. \"Good thinking,\" Joel said, looki ng back t oward the bunker site. \"I think I had better get back d own there, though, just so they'll know the press is aware of those three witnesses. H ow can I get in touch with you?\" \"We'll cal l you,\" Charlene said. He handed me a car d, nodded to Charlene, and headed toward the bunker. Charlene cau ght my eye. \"He was the seventh lerson in the group, wasn't he?\" \"Yeah, I think so.\" We were silent with our thoughts for a m omen, then Charlene said, \"Come on, let's try to get back t o town.\" We had walked for almost an hour when suddelly we heard the sound of songbirds, dozens of them, somewherEto ou r right. Dawn was just breaking and a cool mist rose from th forest floor. \"Now what?\" Charlene asked. \"Look ove r there,\" I said. Through a b reak i n th trees to then orth was a huge, old poplar, perhaps eight feet indiameter. In the half-light of daybreak, the area ar ound the tee appeared brighter somehow, as if the sun, still below the horiDn, had been in position to burst through to radiate downwardon that one splot. I experienced the sense of warmth that had groio so familiar. \"What is it?\" Charlene asked. \"It's Wil!\" I said. \"Let's go ove r there.\" When we were within ten feet, Wil peeked arotnd the tree, smiling broad ly. H e had changed; what was it? As I -on tinued to study his body, I realized that his luminosity was tie same, but he was now more clearly in focus. He hugged us both. \"Were you able to see what happened?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"\"Yes,\" he said. \"I was there with the soul groups I saw everything.\" \"You're in sharper focus. Wh at did you do?\" \"It wasn't what I did,\" he replied. \"It was what you and the group did, especially Charlene.\" \"What do you mean?\" Charlene asked. \"When the five of you increased your energy, and con sciously remembered most of the Wor ld Vision, you lifted this whole val ley into a h igher vibratory pattern. It rose closer to the vibratory level of the Afterlife, which means that I now appear clearer to you, as you appear clearer to m e. Eve n the soul groups will becom e more readily visible in this val ley now.\" I looke d hard at Wil. \"Everything we've seen in this val ley, everything that has happened. It's all the Tenth Insight, isn't it?\" He nodded. \"These same experiences are occu rring to people all ove r the planet. After we grasp the first nine Insights, each of us is left at the same place-trying to live this reality day-today, in the face of what seems to be a g rowing pessimism and divisiveness all around us. Bu t at the same time, we are con tinuing to gain a g reater perspective and clarity about our spiritual situation, about who we really are. We know we are awakening to a m uch larger plan for planet Ear th. \"The Tenth is about maintaining our optimism and staying awake. We 're learning to better identify and believe in our own intuitions, knowing that these mental images are fleeting recollections of our original intention, of how we wanted our lives to evolve. We wanted to follow a certain path in life, so that we cou ld finally remember the truth that our life experiences are preparing us to tell, and bring this knowledge into the world. \"We are now seeing our lives from the higher perspective of the Afterlife. We know that our individual adventures are occu rring within the con text of the long history of human awakening. With this memory, our lives are grounded, put into con text; we can see the long process through which we have been spiritualizing the physical dimension, and what we have left to do.\" Wil. paused momentarily and moved closer to us. \"Now we will see if enough groups like this one com e together and remember, if enough people around the world grasp the Tenth. As we have seen, it is now our responsibility to ke ep the intention, to ensure the future. \"The polarization of Fear is still rising, and if we are to resolve it and move on, each of us must participate personally. We must watch our thoughts and expectations very car efully, and cat ch ourselves every time we treat another human being as an enemy. We can defend ourselves, and restrain certain people, but if we dehumanize them, we add to the Fear. \"We all are souls in growth; we all have an original intention that is positive; and we can all remember. O ur responsibility is to hold that idea for everyone we meet. That's the true Interpersonal Ethic; that's how we uplift, that's the con tagion of the new awareness that is encircling the planet. We either fear that human culture is falling"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"apart, or we can hold the Vision that we are awakening. Ei ther way, our expectation is a p rayer that goes out as a force that tends to bring about the end we envision. Each of us must con sciously choose between these two futures.\" Wil seemed to drift into thought, and in the backg round, against the far ridge toward the south, I cau ght sight again of the streaks of white light. \"With all that was happening,\" I said, \"I never asked you about these movements of white light. Do you know what they are?\" Wil smiled, and reached out and gently touched both of our shoulders. \"They're the angels,\" he said. \"They respond to ou r faith and vision and make miracles. They seem to be a m ystery even to those in the Afterlife.\" At that moment I was seized by a m ental image of a com munity, somewhere in a val ley much like this one. Charlene was there, and others, including many children. \"I think we are supposed to understand the angels next,\" Wil con tinued, gazing out toward the north as if seeing an image of his own. \"Yes, I'm sure of it. Are you two com ing?\" I gazed at Charlene, whose look con firmed that she had seen the same vision as 1. \"I don't think so,\" she said. \"Not right now,\" I added. Without speaking Wil pulled us into a b rief embrace, then turned and walked away. At first, I was reluctant to let him go, but I remained silent. A part of me realized this journey was far from ove r. Soon , I knew, we would see him again.
