The same money finances both sides. We now know through the work of many historians who have spent their lives working on research, that both sides of world conflicts have always been financed by the same people. And, as I've said many times befo re, this seems to be the method to the \"madness\" going on in the world. We know , of course, that we cannot depend on the truthfulness our leaders. Our leaders ar e \"misleaders.\" There is a science they are following. They have their own agenda - and it does not include you. This agenda also does not include many of our politicians, who have sometimes felt helpless and spoke out as a result. In 1922, New York City Mayor John F. Hylan said, \"The real menace of our republic is this invisible government which, like a giant octopus, sprawls its slimy length over city, state and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of a self created screen.... At the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller Standard O il interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as in ternational bankers. The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually r un the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically c ontrol both political parties.\" What I have said, however, is that they do control both parties, among many other things in the world. Conflicts require money and cooperation. World conflicts require world banks and international monetary funds. Professi onal groups all have fraternal orders. Doctors, attorneys, etc., have their own specific fraternal orders. In the banking world, it is the same way. They have the same fraternal order in banking and poli- tics. However, we are not supposed to know anything about that, because that's not any of our business. That fraternal order in politics and banking has been known for many years by those on the inside. It has been referred to by different names, at dif- ferent times, in different count ries. The best overall name that we can confer on this fraternal order, which is running our c ountry, politics, and monetary system, is Freemasonry. Our country, like so many before us, and like so many after us, was in fact founded by Freemasons. Freemas onry, in one form or another, has played a role in almost every government that was founded in this world. It is powerful in opera- tion today throughout the world. However, we do want to establish first that what we are not talking about is Blue Masonry, or the Masonic Lodges in your home- town. We are not talking about the Freemaso ns that live across the street from you. We're talking about a worldw ide fraternal organization that is powerful enough, old enough, and wise enough to ope rate behind all governments in the world, behind fraternal institutions, and behind internati onal monetary systems in the world. And, yes, they are, in fact, connected. For instance, the idea that our country was founded by so many Freemasons and Rosicrucians, among others, will be consistently reve aled throughout this book. We ask ourselves, \"Why do we fold the American flag in a triangle?\" What does the pyramid or the triangle have to do wi th the American system of government on 5"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"6 The Freemasonic royal arch. our dollar bill? We must now recall th at our Constitution was signed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pe nnsylvania is referred to as the Keystone State. The reason why Pennsylvania is the Keystone State, is because the Freemasons that founded this country were members of the Scottish Rite. Keep following here, and you will see what becomes quite evident surrounding the classification of \"key- stone.\" In that Scottish Rite organization there is the Royal Arch Degree. The Royal Arch Degree. And, of course, the Royal Arch, if you do not know, was originally designated because of the sun coming over the horizon in the morning, which made the royal arch. The Freemasonic Royal Arch Degree has been continually, and ever busy, throughout the world with their Freemasonic endeavors. The United States, as I've written, founded its Constitution in Philadelphia, with Pennsylvania becom- ing the \"key stone\" of a royal arch. To this day, Pennsylvania is known as the key- stone state. There is much concerning this conceptual premise in this material that we each need to look at. Who are the Freemasons? Why are Freemasonic emblems and sym- bols depicted on flags throughout the world, and found on all sides of global con- flicts? We might ask ourselves about the Re d Cross. The International Red Cross is a Masonic organization. They always, in every conflict are able to go behind enemy "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"7 A version of the royal arch - the \"g ateway\" arch in St. Louis, Missouri. lines. Why is the Red Cross, the Internat ional Red Cross, able to go behind enemy lines in wartime, in conflict? There is a reason. The International Red Cross, out of London, connected wi th the American Red Cross, comes from the Red Cross of Saint George. The cross on the British flag , the red cross - that is also from a Masonic institution. You might want to ask yourself some very important questions about this point. For instance, why is Hollywood continu- ally bombarding our country and this world with trash movies, which portray violence, rape, crime of every kind - a constant outpouring of appalling blood- shed? Why does Hollywood continue to pump out motion pictures depicting mur- der and violence and bloodshed? Then turning around to insist that movies don't have any influence on young people's minds, or people's minds in general, when the obvious is so conclusively true - that all tapes and movies influence peo- ple's minds. Ask yourself why. What is the purpose for portraying so much vio- lence, and horror, and gory bloodshed in motion pictures? There is a reason for it. You had better think about it. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 You might also want to ask yourself about the biolog- ical warfare going on in the world today. AIDS, coming from out of nowhere, coming into the homosexual commu- nity. Just what are homosexu- als doing today, that they did- n't do six thousands years ago? Why is it that all of a sudden, in the 1980's, we had AIDS? Is there any connec- tion between AIDS and Legionnaire's Disease? And, the biological experimentation going on with the CIA, the NSA, and all the other government agencies that you don't know anything about. Is it possible that there could be some sort of a biological experi ments going on, some of them going awry, some of them purposely going awry, simply to see how far they can go, Is there any kind of rhyme or reason for things that are happening today? Keep in mind, too, that what the govern ment pays for - it gets. If you are paid to do something for the government, they will extract from you exactly what they have paid for. When we understand that, then we must look at our national univer- sities and schools, the government financed institutions of education, to then exam- ine the kind of students, and the level of e ducation that's being turned out by these government financed schools. Logic will tell you that what is being turned out in these schools of higher education, is not in accord with what the state and the fed- era! government wanted. If they were not getting what they proposed, then they would change it. The bottom line is, that the government is getting just exactly what they have ordered. They are getting just what they have paid for! They do not want your children to be educated. They do not want you, or any of us, to think too much. That is why our country and our world has become so pro- liferated with entertainments, mass media, game shows, the distracting drivel of soap operas, the every night, inane nonsense of sit-com television shows, amuse- ment parks, drugs, alcohol, and every other kind of entertainment. It is perpetuated primarily to keep the human mind distracted and entertained. This constant dis- traction assures that you don't get in th e way of important people by doing too much thinking! You had better wake up and understand that there are people guid- ing your life and you don't even know it. And, we now understand that most all American citizens have suspected that some thing like this is going on. But we are all too busy being frenzied with this entertainment and distractions, trying to stay alive and live our lives, and, after all, wh at can one person do about it? One person can do nothing. But, a national well-informed society can do much. Why does Hollywood do motion pictures like Deathwish and Dirty Harry, always showing how regular ci tizens are misused, abused, tricked and deceived By their government - and, then, one lone guy has to stand up for what's right, because the whole system is corrupt? Why do you thi nk they make movies like that? Is there a message in that? I'll tell you why. It's very simple. First of all, these conspirators, these people, make the movies, showing you what the problem is, then they make the movies to show you what the solution is. They know that you are frustrated. They know that the people of America are fru strated, because they know there is no law and order. But, that's purposely create d. We're not supposed to have law and order, yet! We're supposed to have crime, and the immorality, and the drugs, and the murder, and all the other things we're besieged by. We're supposed to have that. If the government did not want that, it would not be here to the degree that we have it, believe me. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"9 The American government is the most powerful government the world has ever known. They had the ability to get a hold on Adolph Hitler a few decades ago. He had a standing army. Plus the greatest navy, air force, military, and secret under- world organizations operating throughout the world. But, this government got a hold on Adolph Hitler, because it chose to, a nd it wanted to. And, if you do not pay your income taxes they will find you if you go to the Amazon jungle. And, they will make an example of you. They will find you and they will deal with you, and you know it. But, for some reason they are unable to get a handle on the drugs, and the crime in the streets, for some reason. There is a reason, and that is what we want to talk about. There is a method to the \"madness.\" You might also want to ask yourself ab out something from the early seventies. While no one was looking, NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, changed its fatigue colors, from the dark greens, a nd the browns, the fatigue colors, or the camouflaged colors, to light tan. Throughout the Western world the colors would change for the military from dark greens to light tan, like sand. Why? Because this government, along with its NATO allies realized that there would be a war in an area where they would need camouflage wh ich would be light tan. So, quietly they changed that, they changed the color, and you didn't know anything about it. You want to ask, too, Where did the Communist government and Adolph Hitler get their money? Who financed Stalin, who financed Lenin, Trotsky, who financed the Communist revolution? You might want to ask yourself, what part did American Wall Street play, and the international ba nkers in New York, in Switzerland, in London? What part did they play in fi nancing Hitler? Like the Communist move- ment, and God knows what else they are financing throughout the world. The idea was that those who direct the overall conspiracy could use the differences in those two so-called ideologies [marxism/fascism/ socialism v. democracy/capitalism] to enable them [the Illuminati] to divide larger and larger portio ns of the human race into opposing camps so that they could be armed and then brainwashed into fight - ing and destroying each other. â€”Myron Fagan Why is it that drugs are brought into this country daily and we are not able to do anything about it? Why are we unable to do anything about the aliens pouring in across the border? I am here to tell y ou why. It is very simple. The government gets what it wants. There is a method to the \"madness,\" and we are going to explain that to you. The last two weeks of July, of every year , a secret meeting is held in our coun- try in northern California, by the worl d's most powerful people. Bankers, politi- cians, industrialists, entertainment luminaries, a huge composite of puissant world figures. This group is directly linked with the European ruling elites, and is com- monly known as the Bohemian Society. Our now famous Council of Foreign Relations, the government behind the Amer ican government, is represented at the Bohemian Grove, along with members of the Bilderberger Group of Europe. A meeting is held, once a year there, to decide on a worldwide scale a manipulative agenda concerning your future. A shining example of true democracy carried on in the dark. Obviously, here, your vote doesn' t count. Appropriately, the owl was cho- sen as a symbol for this ilk, for it, too, is at home in the dark. The name bohemian carries a dictionary definition as, \"Acomm unity of persons who adopt manners and mores, conspicuously different from those expected, or approved of by the majori- ty of society who disregard conventional standards of behavior.\" No wonder they want no input from you. More specifically, and even darker, but equally as insidi- ous is the American organization that our own former President George Bush belongs to, namely, the Skull and Bones fraternal group supported by students studying under the auspices of Yale Univer sity. Rightly underst ood to be America's "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"10 secretly designed establishment. The Bohemian Society, Skull and Bones, CIA, DEA, Mafia, and the IRS are just some of the groups that make up the true power behind the throne of America. Like all other kingships, America's power elite hinges on family blood. Just like the power structure of the Mafia. If you don't believe me, that an \"elite\" runs America, then listen to these prominent people: Today the path of total dictatorship in the United States can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen an d unheard by the Congress, the President, or the people. Outwardly we have a Constitutional govern - ment. We have, operating within our government and political system, another body representing another fo rm of government - a bureau - cratic elite. â€”Senator William Jennet, 1954 The case for government by elites is irrefutable. â€”Senator William Fulbright, former chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated at a 1963 symposium entitled: The Elite and the Electorate - Is Government by the People Possible? Once again, it hinges a lot on bloodlines. The lineages of the American Presidents and their bloodlines could make an entire book of its own. Rest assured, that they are connected to the European aristocracies of power. Starting from Edward II, and the III, of England, twenty-eight out of our forty-two presidents were connected by English blood. Including President Bush and Vice President Quayle, who are also, in fact, related to each other. Most of the fourteen not con- nected by blood, were connected by frater nal orders used by the bloodlines, with only a few exceptions. Notably, one instance being a critical disruption by the Kennedy's, who purposefully sought to disrupt this dynasty of power in America. Owing to their vast financial backing and personal, intellectual charisma, plus much behind the scenes political maneuvering by his father, Joe Kennedy, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was inserted into the pr esidency. The idea being, to disrupt the status quo by establishing a Kennedy Roman Catholic dynasty, and, thereby, serv- ing notice on the Freemasonic powers of this world of their unwillingness to coop- erate and play by the rules. Justifying f eeling threatened, the established bloodlines of power in America removed the Kennedy threat, twice! Official police records showed that the John Kennedy assassina tion was closely preceded and followed by as many as one hundred assassinations, a ll of which were closely connected with the Kennedy's family rise to power. In our discussion of secret societies, Free masonry, and occult orders in gener- al, we want to talk about one that might be familiar to you, or, perhaps, you have even heard about. It is called the Illumina ti. We don't intend to spend a lot of time on the Illuminati, but just enough to famili arize you if you've never heard of the organization. It was founded in 1776, in the South of Germany, by a man named Adam Weishaupt. He formulated his plans in relation to the House of Rothschild in England, Germany, France, and Italy. Th e Rothschild banking dynasty, behind the government's of Europe, hired Adam Weishaupt to formulate a strategy for the world at that time to accomplish certain goa ls for those in power. That plan came to be known as the Illuminati plan. Please note that you can find most of this mate- rial in any library, any encyclopedia under the word Illuminati, which obviously comes from the word illumine, to be enlightened, to be in the light. There is a very important book which I would like to bring to your attention, called Fire in the Minds of Men. It is writ ten on the origins of the revolutionary fate. Fire in the Minds of Men was written by James Billington and is a profoundly important book in understanding the revolutio nary radical moveme nts of the world today, and how they were cr eated, who finances them and what they are really all about. I would like to share with you a couple of his ideas that deal with the occult "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"11 origins of the organizational arrangements on just how occult organizations throughout the world, namely secret societ ies, are organized. In the book, on page 87, Billington states that the story of secret societies can never be fully restructured. It has been badly neglected, even avoide d one suspects, because the evidence that is available repeatedly leads us into terr itory equally uncongenial to modern histo- rians in the East and the West. In what follows, I shall attempt to show that the modern revolutionary tradi- tion, as it came to be internationalized under Napoleon, during the Restoration, grew out of occult Freemasonry. The early organizational revolutionary ideas orig- inated more from Pythagorean mysticis m than from practical experience. Moreover, the real innovators were not so much the political activists, as much as literary intellectuals on whom German romantic thought in general, and the Bavarian Illuminati, in particular, exer ted great influence. Here, Billington was specifically talking about the organization of the Bavarian Illuminati. You can't dis- cuss the Illuminati without understanding th e Jesuit order of the Catholic Church, because Adam Weishaupt himself, the foun der of the Illuminati, was, in fact, a Jesuit priest. He was not just an ordinary Jesuit priest, however. In Bavaria he con- tinued to support revolutionary radical thinking against the church, giving to the world what has come to be known, as the revolutionary tradition. May 1, 1776, was when Adam Weishaupt founded this order. This date is important, of course, in the Soviet Union and other communist countries, because May 1st, May Day, is considered to be the momentous date to all communist rev- olutionaries, when Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati. This you will find, as I said, in any encyclopedia. The bait that was laid by Adam Weishaupt for control of a vast number of people worldwide, which has now become a very old and tired project. The project was called Democracy, a people's democracy. Adam Weishaupt, like many others before hi m, understood that Democracy has never worked, is not working now, and never will work. Basically, beca use of the reason, while people could be and are the central power of any government, the people do not hold the power of any government in th e final analysis. And, that while on the surface Democracy seems to be the best of all possible worlds, Democracy is a very perverted form of government, because the people can be misled. Democracy comes from the word demos, meaning mob - a mob in the street is a demos. Demos-ocracy; ocracy meaning rule. Demos-ocracy, or democracy, means mob rule. You might say that true de mocracy is like thirty-five whites hang- ing one black. That's democracy. The rule of the mob. Now, when we put it into more Americanized political terms, its the rule of the people. And, while that may sound good in print, the founders of demo cracy in our modern day form realized that the people could be manipulated into accepting whatever they would want the people to accept. Let's go on with the subject of the Illuminati and its symbols. You will find the symbol of the secret society on the back of a one dollar bill. On the back of the one dollar bill on the left-hand side you will see the pyramid with an all-seeing eye, the eye of Horus, the Egyptian God of Light, the Egyptian God, God's son, and you will see beneath the pyramid seventeen seventy-six, spelled out in Roman Numerals, plus the words, Annuit Coeptis, and is translated as Annuit, our enter- prise. Coeptis is translated to mean \"cro wned with success,\" or \"is crowned with success,\" therefore, Annuit Coeptis is \" our enterprise, which is now a success.\" Then in order to find out what enterprise was a success, read on the one dollar bill at the bottom of the pyramid, Novus Ordo Seclorum. Which translates as the \"New Order of the World\" - The New World Order! Now, we must remember that Germany was the home of the concept of The New World Order. Adolph Hitler's entire motivation was to es tablish a \"new world order.\" But, in order to establish a new world order, you have to destroy the old world order. And, that is exactly what Hitler set out to do, destroy all of the old aristocracy, familial "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"12 power bases in Europe, and then set up a new world order. This brings us now to the Masonic Lodges in the South of Germany, and their connections with the French Revolution. There is a tremendous amount of information on that subject, but we won't go into that here. Suffice it to say, that there was an immense amount of Freemasonic activity involved with the French Revolution, in the Mexican Revolution and the American Revolution, and in all other revolutions going on throughout the world. There are many, ma ny instances of Freemasons in govern- ment, Freemasons in banking, and Freemas ons in fraternal orders, operating and working together, but we don't know about all of the hidden agendas. While our people were preparing to go into the Middle East, the Gulf War, we were not aware of the facts of what was really going on in the Middle East. That was a war designed between secret societ ies, factions, occu lt movements that we didn't know anything about. It has nothing whatsoever to do with oil, has nothing whatsoever to do with a conflict that America should be concerned with. It has to do with some very old and ancient Freemasonic strategy. The world can therefore seize the opportunity [Persian Gulf crisis] to fulfill the long-held promise of a New World Order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind. â€”George Bush, U.S. President at the time I would like to demonstrate a point to you from this book, Fire in the Minds of Men, something very interesting and importa nt, as we get into the symbols of the Illuminati and symbols of the Freemasonic or ders of the world. On page 6, recount- ed in the Introduction, it says: European aristocraci es transferred their lighted candles from Christian altars to Masonic lodges. The flame of occult alchemists, which had promised to turn dross into gold, reappeared at the center of new \"circles\" seeking to r ecreate a golden age: Bavarian Illuminists conspiring against the Jesuits, French Philadelphians against Napoleon, Italian charco al burners against Hapsburgs. Always two sides. He continued by sa ying that the mythic model for revolu- tionaries during the time of Marx and Lenin was Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind. The Promethean faith of revolutionari es used the flame, or light, in a strong symbolic fa shion. It was the central theme. Here's the point. Consider a more pointed millennial assumption, that on the \"new day\" that was dawning, the sun w ould never set. Early during the French Revolution was born the \"solar myth of the Revolution,\" suggesting that the sun was rising on a new era in which darkness would vanish forever. This image became implanted at a level of consciousness that was simultaneously interpreted as something real and would ultimately produce a new reality. The new reality they sought was radically secular and stringently simple. The idea was not the balanced complexity of the new American Federation, but the occult simplicity of its great seal, an all-seeing eye atop a pyramid, over the words Novus Ordo Seclorum. The seal that we have on the American do llar bill is an occult seal of an occult society, pursuing an occult agenda. Most are not aware of that now, however, we are hopeful that many of the people of our country will become aware of it soon. We are optimistic that books like Fire in the Minds of Men will help make the gen- eral population aware of the occult forces that are mooing their government and their lives. It is not our purpose to spend too much time on this particular order of Freemasonry, or the Illuminati. But we do want to spend enough time so that you understand how it worked, what its purposes were and how it affects the world "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"13 societies, because it is still with us today. It has taken on different forms, in differ- ent countries, but is still basically the secret ruling power in the world today. Now, perhaps, some of you are aware of this material that we are discussing right now, and maybe you are not. But, to show that this is not just our under- standing of things, we have gone as far back as the founding of the United States. We have some comments from George Wa shington, which we are going to share with you here. The following is an article from the Grand Jury of the State of Pennsylvania, published in the 1800's, dealing with Freemasonry and the Illuminati, and the problems they were confronting in the State of Pennsylvania. As we said, George Washington mentione d the Illuminati, and I mentioned the Illuminati before in this book, in relation to the democratic societies that were being founded in the United States. The Democratic Party today is an outgrowth of what we call the democratic societies of Eur ope. The democratic societies, on the sur- face, sound good. But when one looks furthe r into what democracy means and how it actually works, it does not seem to function too well. And, there's a reason. Let me first give you an example. In the Eleventh Report, State Investigations Committee on Education, published in 1953 by the California State Senate, it talks about the Illuminati. If you go out and search for it, a copy can be obtained for your further investigation. In dealing with the subject of Communism and secret soci- eties of Communism in ] 953, on page 1 68, we will demonstrate further how impor- tant it is that you should know about, as well as study this document. It says, Since many intelligent persons, even those in high official positions do not appear to have acquainted themselves with the real nature and seriousness of Communism, it is perhaps appropriate to briefly pro- vide you with some really informat ive, authentic data concerning it. Communism and Russia are by no means synonymous. Russia mere- ly occupies the unfortunate position of being Communism's first vic- tim. Communism is synonymous w ith world revolution and seeks the destruction of all nations, the abol ition of patriotism, religion, mar- riage, family, private property and a ll political and civil liberties, con- cerned with the establishment of a worldwide dictatorship of the so- called proletariat, which is, in fact, an autocratic self-constituted dic- tatorship by a small group of sel f-perpetuating revolutionaries.... A bit later on page 169, the document goes on to say, So-called modern Communism is ap parently the same hypocritical and deadly world conspiracy to destroy civilization that was founded by the secret order of Illuminati in Bavaria in May 1, 1776, and that raised its hoary head here in our co lonies at critical periods before the adoption of our Federa l Constitution. The worl d revolution conspira- cy appears to have been so well organized, and ever continuing to be ever on the alert to take advantage of every opportunity presenting itself, or that the conspira tors could create. It is significant in this con- nection that as early as 1783, when unsettled conditions and dissatis- faction in some quarters had arisen in the American colonies, subver- sive anonymous sermons were circulated among the colonial army to incite dissatisfaction and rebellion. George Washington immediately called the army together and in addressing them used this significant language, remembering that this is 1783. George Washington, when addressing the army, states, \"My God, what can this writer have in view by recommending such measur es? Can he be a friend to the army? Can he be a friend of this country? Rather, is he not an insidi- ous foe; some emissary, pe rhaps, from New York....\" Then in the next paragr aph, the California State Senate report continues, ...it is plain that George Washington believed that the then center of this secret conspiracy, so far as th is country was concerned, was to be located in the city of New York.... "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"14 We now know that there has been some sort of a manipulation of our govern- ment, our money, our institutions, and our lives, by our government. But what we don't realize is that there is a covert agenda. There is a method to the \"madness.\" We want to concertedly look into thes e secret movements of the world and understand how they affect us and our private lives. Now, we may not think they affect us on our private level, but they do. They affect your children in school, they affect what your children learn, they affect what you learn from daily and nightly television. There have been many movies discussing this publicly. Even George Washington in his personal letters men tions the Illuminati and Freemasonry. George Washington himself was a Freemason. In response to a letter sent to George Washington in 1798, warning him about a Masonic movement operating in America, and this particular Masonic movement referred to as the Illuminati, George Wash ington responded in a letter to the person saying: It was not my intention to doubt th at the doctrines of the Illuminati, the principles of Jacobinism, had not spread into the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of that fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey was that I did not believe that the lodges of Freemasonry in this country, as so cieties, have endeavored to prom- ulgate the diabolical tenets of the pernicious principles of the latter, if they are susceptible to separation, but, that individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument founded, or the instru- ment employed to found the democratic societies in the United States may have had these objects in mind, and actually had the separation of the people from their government in view, is too evident to ques- tion. What George Washington was saying was the mere fact that someone had charged that the Illuminati was operating in America. George Washington said, \"On the contrary, no one is more satisfied with that fact, than I am.\" And then he pro- ceeded to say that he did not believe that all Freemasons were involved in this plot, but that the founders of the democratic so ciety in America, the Democratic Party, as we call it today in America, had the obj ect in mind of the Illuminati's projects. \"And the Democratic Party,\" George Wash ington said, \"had the separation of the people from their government in view. It is too evident to be questioned.\" That may explain why today, in a democratic count ry like America, when the people make certain demands on the government, they experience no response. The people want this, the government doesn't respond. The people demand that, the government doesn't respond, because the whole concep t of the democratic process in America was purposely contrived to divide the people from their government, so that the people could be out there working hard every day, taking care of their lives, feed- ing their children, and sendi ng their politicians to Washington to look out for them. When the politicians got there, they were already members of certain fraternal organizations and all government was alread y taken care of, so that the people had nothing to say about anything. And, that's the point we're trying to make, that when you send politicians to Washington, DC, they might just as well stay home, because the rhyme and reason of government has al ready been decided by secret societies and fraternal orders that you don't know anything about. In our discussion of the Illu minati we want to also, when talking about the dol- lar bill, and the symbol on the back of th e dollar bill, share with you a pertinent accounting from the Congressional Repor t, published by the Congress of the United States. This report ta lks about integral steps towa rd a British Union, a world state, leading to international strife. Intern ational strife is very much connected with a world state, and British Union. As we rev ealed before, Britain is referred to as God's Kingdom, the United Kingdom. Interna tional strife, which is happening throughout the world, is part and parcel of preparing the world for God's United Kingdom, and America is playing its critical part. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"15 God's Kingdom is, of course, coming through Britain and America. England has been chosen to sit on Jehovah's \"ruli ng throne\" until Jesus returns (according to their rules of royalty), which provides the world with a conve nient racist philos- ophy. As I often mention, that provides the basis for racism in the world today. And then, we wonder in this country why the r est of the world doesn 't seem to care for America very much. There is a lot that we should know a bout concerning the symbols on the dollar bill. Let me go through another Congressi onal Report, published back in 1940. It says on page 13: Let me call to your attention the fact that on the reverse of the great seal of the United States, which app ears on our dollar bills, you will find the exact symbol of the Britis h/Israel World Federation. This symbol is also carried on the literature of other organizations promot- ing a world government, and a world religion. At the bottom of the cir- cle surrounding the pyramid you will find the wording Novus Ordo Seclorum. It was this new order that was advocated by Clinton Roosevelt several hundred years a go, and recently from Philip Drew, and now followed by the Executive. We understand now that the whole concep t of a new world order is a revolu- tionary idea developed out of Freemasonry. I want to go back to the Introduction in the book, Fire in the Minds of Men, and lay the foundation for something I think you are going to find very interesting. Again, on page 6, we quote, from the Introduction: A recurrent mythic model for revolutionaries - early romantics, the young Marx, the Russians of Leni n's time - was Pr ometheus, who stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind. The Promethean faith of revolutionaries resembled in many respects the general modern belief that science would lead me n out of darkness and into light. It is interesting that in New York City, the Empire State, in Rockefeller Plaza, at the very entrance to Rockefeller Plaza is an enormous statue of Prometheus. How appropriate, and when one understands how the Soviet Communist Party was financed, organized, and directed out of New York, then it will not be any great mystery as to why in front of Rockefelle r Plaza we have the figure of this Titan God, Prometheus. James Billingt on explains in his book, Fire in the Minds of Men, that that is a symbol of the world revo lutionaries. Then it goes on to say in the Introduction, that there was a Millennium coming. A New World Order, a Millennium. A thousand year reign. From Fire in the Minds of Men it says: But there was also the more pointed, millennial assumption that, on the new day that was dawning, the sun would never set. Early during the French upheaval was born a \"solar myth of the revolution,\" sug- gesting that the sun was rising on a new era in which darkness would vanish forever. This whole idea of the Sun rising on a new era, a new dawn, is the Millennial assumption. We can see this openly being used today by our former President, George Bush, in such newspaper clippings identified as The New World Order, and that the world is now being formed into a New World Order. We want to talk about that, and what it means for you. The newspapers play a big part in telling us only what those in power want us to hear. You thought this was only a communist idea or concept? Think again. We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publicati ons whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"16 prepared to march towards a wo rld government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely prefer - able to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries. â€”David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991. Control of America's newspa pers goes back to the beginnings of the industrial age, when vested interests with large sums of cash moved in. In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan in terests, thesteel, shipbuilding, and powder interest, and their subsidia ry organizations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient num - her of them to control generally the policy of the daily press....They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the great - est papers. An agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the ques - tions of preparedness, militarism, fi nancial policies, and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers. â€”U.S. Congressman Oscar Callawayx, 1917 The point is, what we are being told is controlled. Controlled information. And the New world Order idea is now starting to be presented to us. As a matter of fact, reported previously in the daily newspape r, during early 1992, Bush urged us to enter the Gulf War crisis. Beneath it, it says he sees the Gulf as a test of the New World Order. That same \"New World Order\" is on the back of the dollar bill, it's plainly written on the bottom of the pyramid th at's on the dollar bill. That's an inter- esting concept, and it's one that you should know about, because what went on in the Middle East Gulf War was part and parcel of a Freemasonic movement. Freemasonry has made arrangements to organize and direct financial control for different segments of society in our country and throughout the world. They have realized that in this country black movements are moving within mainstream America, therefore, the need arises for black leaders to be able to fall in line, to go along, to get along. Some of the black Free masons that have finally been accepted into the order, for instance, are Jesse Jackson; Andrew Young, Mayor of Atlanta; The five \"circles\" of Freem asonic friendship: In additi on to five certain coun- tries (Italy, France, Germany, England an d America), this symbol is more recently said to represent the continents of the earth."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"17 Only four circles? Of course, America is not included in this project. Kenneth Gibson, three-time Mayor of the City of Newark, New Jersey; the late Harold Washington, the Mayor of Chicago; State Senator, Julian Bond; Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall; Marion Ba rry, Mayor of District of Columbia. We see that Freemasonry uses all races to accomplish its objectives. In Freemasonry in Europe the groups we re called circles. The circles were called friends. There were five circle of friends, America being one of them. Italy, France, Germany, England, and America are the five circles of friends. They were called in European Freemasonry, the Olym piads, so that today the Olympiad Organization's symbol is five circles, the five Masonic circles of friends. Of course, the Audi automobile has only four circl es, because America's not included in that project. The circles were, to be sure, the ci rcle of friends within the Masonic league. The torch, of course, the Olympic torch, is the torch of Prometheus, the God who stole fire for the service of man. And, agai n, as we said, in New York in front of Rockefeller Plaza you will see the statue of Prometheus, holding in his hand a flame, the torch, the fire of revolution. The dime, of course, on the Mercury head dime, inscripted on the back of the dime you will find the torch of illumination. It's still there today. The modern American dime has the torch of illumina- tion. The Statue of Liberty has the torch. Of course, on all uni- versities and colleges we find in their symbols and emblems that they have the torches, symboli- cally standing for illumination of the Illuminati. As a matter of fact, when you are a graduate from a university you become an Alumni, which is taken from, obviously, Aluminati, Illuminati. Emphasizing that you become illuminated when you go to a uni- versity. The torch is also used in the Amoco Oil logo. It is found many, many places. Chevrolet, in "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18 its Saffron Division of General Motors, is putting out its illuminum car, not alu- minum, but an \"illumined\" car from the Illuminati. Then when you go to college and a university, or even when you graduate from high school you come out procession- ally with a black robe, which is black for Saffron, the God of the Hebrews, requiring that you wear the square mortarboard on top of your head. The square mortarboards are, of course, used by the Freemasons for their plaster, so that is why you wear a square mortarboard when you graduate, ultimately becoming an Alumni. It all has to do with Freemasonry, it all has to do with the con- trol of education in this country, the control of our religious thinking, our government, our money, our lives, everything. Your cor- ner drugstore is influenced by Freemasonry, secret societies, occu lt orders, and politics of the scientific kind. Our founding fathers are probably turn- ing over in their graves as they see what has happened to us, and how we have been deflected from our pur pose and our mission in the world, to ultimately become nothing but pawns in the game. Our liberty is threatened. Look at the liberty bell, the symbol of liberty. An equal identical bell was found, with the same crack, in Moscow. It's a very famous liberty bell, with the same crack. It has becomes known as a symbol, the symbol of the Brotherhood of the Bell, Bell, being Bel, the ancient God in the Mesopotamian Valley, being the one that we call Beelzebub, or Yahweh. There are way too many symbols, just too many things going on in our world that we are not aware of in this busy time in which we live. That incidentally, as I mentioned before, provides the basis for racism in the world today. Let us propose that it is high time we take time to look around us and see the emblems of power, see the emblems and seals of our gov- ernment. Look at the dollar bill, instead of trying to earn one. Just look at one for a change, look on the front at the Masonic emblems on it, look on the back for the Masonic emblems there. Ask yourself why it is that our country operates the way it does and is there a rhyme or reas on as to the way things happen. One should understand that General Motors , Ford Motor Company, and all the other companies in the indust rialized world have a speci fic agenda. They don't just wake up every morning and decide what they are going to do. Large, very large international corporations have to make pl ans for tomorrow, for next week, for next year. When you have hundreds of thousands of people on a payroll, you can't afford to wait to the last minute to decide what you are going to do. The ship of state is far too large to turn around, just overnight. It's like a giant ocean liner. The ship of state is a very large vessel. You have to make plans for it, you have to direct the people. You have to concentrate your power , you have to concentrate the people's attention on certain things, in order to get them to go in the direction for which you "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"19 want them to participate. We are a very large and powerful people in America, so our masters have to direct our thinking for us and prepare us in advance for their des- ignated plans, for their hidden agendas. And, of course, like docile sheep we just go along to get along, because we don't know anymore about it than what we see on television. It's about time that we look into this enigmatic world that we live in and examine who we are, why we are doing what we are doing, and notice just where we are going. That's the purpose of what we are try- ing to do. As we said before, we are not trying to explain everything in detail, because we simply couldn't in this short publication. But, we are trying to make you aware that there is an enormous world of material out there that you should be concerned with and know about, and it is our purpose to provide you with that material. You will find that the many things which we have investi gated and collected on the secret societie s, on our government, governments of the world, are just fascinating. When we remember that Abraham Lincol n was the first President to break all diplomatic ties with the Vatican, in th e 1860's, we become even more aware. Diplomatic ties continued broken with the United States until the coming of President Ronald Reagan. He reestablishe d full diplomatic ties with the Vatican, the first President, since Lincoln, to do so. Reagan's next official act was to travel to Europe, at least three times, to meet in private with the Pope. We were not told what was discussed. Later, the Pope w as a host to other summit meetings. And then, of course, Ronald Reagan traveled to Europe to visit the war dead, or so we are told. He ended up at Bitsburg Cemete ry, the burial spot for the Nazi SS Officers. We have to wonder what was going on. Did Ronald Reagan not know he was going to aNazi burial spot ? Of course he did, he's not a fool. There are no such things as mistakes made by presidents. What they do and where they go is always well planned and done for a reason. When we see things happening on the world scene, and we say the President made a mistake, the government made a mi stake, you have to know that a govern- ment the size of the United States doesn' t make mistakes. They are well calculat- ed moves. They know what they are doing, and often times have a hidden agenda that they simply cannot make public. You would be amazed as to how often this happens. They have an idea, a purpose, so they don't make mistakes. Ronald Reagan's going to Bitsburg was purposely contrived. It signaled something to secret societ ies. The Gulf crisis, in the early 1990s , was just another calculated plan in the scheme of world agendas. There ar e many innuendoes, and things that are being said, which lead one to understand th at there is more going on in the Middle East than what we were told about, and as we said before, it has little to nothing to do with oil, little to nothing to do with a threat against this country, because the bot- tom line is that this country has very lit tle it can be threatened with. Threats cer- tainly do exist, but not to the degree that one would think. There are some interesting books out there which show many Freemasonic connections to our societies, religions, and political leaders, including connections "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 between the Order of Malta with the Pope and Rome, and the Freemasonic double- headed eagle with England. England and Rome use Freemasonic symbols at the highest religious levels, ele- ments in relation to Christianity - or should I say Jehovah Witness's brand of Christianity. We have such books as Christian by Degrees, Masonic Revealed in the Light and the Faith of Jehovah, Testament for a New World, The Seven Books Containing a Sense of Spiritual Wisdom, given to us by the Knights Templar. Therein, the Table of Contents reveals a Book of Jehovah and the book of Jehovah's Kingdom on Earth, with the Knights emblem. We see that Jehovah's Kingdom on Earth is no more than a Masonic Kingdom, like the British United Kingdom. Jehovah Witnesses, along with the Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists and, as we said, all the other York Rite Masonic cults in America, are consistently spreading. They are the shock troops, so to speak, for Freemasonry, who spread the message for the kingdom to the rest of us in this nation to accept their Mas onic Kingdom. They, unbeknownst to them- selves, are the forerunners for a New World Order. However, unfortunately, they have no idea in this world, just what is coming. They have been duped, and they are too proud and arrogant to understand that duplicity. We studied a book called the Teachings of Freemasonry, and on the book's cover we found the Jewish Star of David, because, in fact, Freemasonry is heavily Jewish. Freemasonry has always known that its greatest enemy in Western Civilization is Rome. That's why there has always been this animosity between the Catholic Church and Judaism. There has always been this animosity between the Catholic Church and Judaism. For centuries, the Jews have been persecuted in the Old Country, in Europe, and there still re mains that animosity between Judaism and the Catholic movement today, but not becaus e of religion, but because of the secret societies that operate behind the scenes of both of those organizations. You might be interested to know that the Pope's headdress, the Papal head- dress, actually goes back to an ancient Je wish headdress. And, of course, the Pope wears the yurmulke, and the highly ordained Catholic Cardinals wear the yurmulke. But, notice in particular, that the Pope and clergy wear a headdress that is Freemasonic. The breastplate and/or apron are also frequently associated with freemasonry. We have other Masonic garb showing that when we see the Pope and "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"21 we see the priest, we now know that when we see other religious movements through- out the world, their garb - it's all represen- tative of Freemasonry. I think some of those now among us that are concerned with the race issue throughout the world might be interested to know that there is another Freemasonic brotherhood of power, which is presented â–  as an expose of the secret Afrikaner ; Brotherhood. So when we see what is hap- pening in South Africa, it is no great won-: der that South Africa's greatest friend is Israel. There is a famous song from the 1960's, entitled, Does Anyone Know What Time It Is? We respectfully submit that it is time to wake up and face the most serious problems that we face as a free society. It is high time, like the owl, that we see things that have been kept in the dark from us. This will not be difficult, because the truth has been hiding in plain view all along. In the Congress resides the American symbols of power, known in the dictionary as the fasces. The fasces itself is nothing more than an ancient symbol, of an ancient priesthood, from an ancient world. The ax explains why, in the Second World War, the powers of Hitler were called the Axis Powers. The fasces was used by the Priesthood of the Ax in the ancient world and by Adolph Hitler, General Franco, and Mussolini, and many other underworld fascist movements, likened to Mafia-style organiza- tions, commonly understood to be called the \"Untouchables.\" As I said previously, and as even Time Magazine has obvi- ously had to admit, our leaders are the best that money can buy. They have sold you out to a hid- den agenda covertly kept behind the scenes from a long time ago. Now, you have just seen the faint outline. In the past, we have tried to enlighten your mind to a subject that has not been adequately dealt with, and that is the secret societies and subversive movements that are restructuring our world, by using all sorts of guises and "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"22 The fasces, prominently displayed in the House Of Representatives, Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia) excuses for their subterfusive profiles. Everything from the Jehovah Witnesses, to the Mormons, with their Zion National Park, and the New World Order, the racist philosophies that pervade th e Western World. It has imminently become an idea whose time has come to speak of these subjects. We have adequate documentation for the revelations exposed in this book, if you would like to inquire further for corrobor ation of this mountain of evidence. It is obvious that such a vastly controlled vol ume of research cannot be adequately covered in this modest edition. We do si ncerely hope that we can present some of these broader concepts and ideas that could be fresh and new for you to explore. We at least want to impress on you this thought. This country was based on the premise that individual citizens have a right to know the truth, as well as the right to understand and to expect from our leader s to exemplify the truth. We haven't received the truth from our leaders, and it now appears conclusive that we are not going to be guaranteed that unalienable right as American citizens. They have their own agenda, and their own ideas about what they are going to do to continue this world control and domination, and it apparently doesn't include the opinions of you, me, or our next door neighbors. All that you are expected to do is work hard and pay your taxes, be a capital product for their controlled system, and not ever ask any questions! I think it is now high time that our country does ask questions of its leaders - its \"misleaders.\" As I have stated before, we have the best religious and political leaders that money can buy. It is definitely time we begin to look at these subjects very deeply. Churches, almost all chur ches that you will go to have a pointed arch, the stained windows, or the pointed doors. Now, the pointed arch is because of the "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"23 female, that's the female womb. That is why for a couple of thousand years now, Christian priests have always been offici- ating. They have always been in charge, after walking through those doors, and they don't want women priests because it doesn't look right for a women to be \"in\" a women. It has to do with sex, and that's why the pointed door on the church has to do with the pointed arch of the female. And, the man is said to be dominating, or ruling over, commanding the pointed arch. He enters into the pointed arch, and at that time is referred to in the ancient Hebrew as the holy of holies. The holy of holies was always considered to be the womb, the holy arch, and that's where life comes from, and that's as close to God as you are going to get. Therefore, the sex act was considered to be the closest way that man and woman could get to God. It doesn't have a thing to do with being holy, it has to do with life and the female womb. The priest wears the long black robe, because he is wearing the garb of the woman, the long black robe of the female. It was always considered, from ancient times, that all Divine wisdom was in the women, the female. She was called Sophia, which meant wisdom to the Greeks. Another female word is nun. In Hebrew the word nun is for fish, and there were people in the Bible like Joshua, the son of nun, and also Jesus, son of the fish. So there were men connect- ed with this nun/fish meaning in the Bible. In many cases, Yahweh, or Jehovah, was an her- maphrodite â€” the God of the Hebrews was both male and female. That's what the Hebrew word for the Tetragrammaton implied, that's why the Bible says that God made man in His own image, \"made He male and female,\" because God was male and female. The seven candle lamp stand was the seven lights of the ancient world. A candle is a light. It is not a big light, but a little "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24 Churches traditionally have an arched entryway, representing the female, which the priest enters into. light, that is why you had seven lights in the heavens. The seven polestars, the seven great Gods of the ancient world, in the heavens. Today we hear that God is love, but God is not \"Jove.\" Somewhere al ong the line the \"J\" got changed to \"L,\" now God is Love. Originally, God was Jove . Our system of numbering in America goes to ten and stops, becaus e ten is the holy number. The holy number in ancient Egyptian, the number of God, was IO. The lett er I, and the letter O. Today we have 10 - the number ten, which is the highest unit you can go to, so it has nothing to do with God, it has to do with Egypt. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"25 Our culture and our country today has its connections with England. England's royal fam- ily comes from the original Egyptian divinities, which were Isis, Osiris, and Horus. Those three divinities were called the holy family, or the royal family, and of course, today, we have the royal family in England. Believe it or not, that's where their royalty comes from - black Africa - but we don't talk about th at publicly because we don't want to bring this subject up. That royal family in England gets their lineage, and there so-called royalty from actual divinities in Egypt. When you strip it all down, you are going to find out that there is nothing royal about England. I love England, and I love the English people, I am just telling you what my investigation has revealed through years of study, from books, and other academic sources. The words Brit - ish, in Hebrew, mean a contract, or writ, a holy writ. So the word for Brit is contract, or covenant. And the word in Hebrew for man is ish; therefore Brit â€” ish is the covenant man, or holy man. That is where we get the idea that the King of England is so holy, because he is Brit - ish, or a \"holy man.\" But that is Hebrew. Then when you find out where this whole idea of the holiness came from, and believe me, this is considered a very serious thing, because the King of England is considered to be one of the holiest men in the world. When you understand, then there is something that you will want to watch. And that is when Prince Charles or Andrew or whoever is crowned King, the Archbishop of Canterbury will read his initi- ation rites to the King, to the young man, and he will recite his rites back. When he is given those initiation rites to be King, listen to the words that the Archbishop of Canterbury says to that new King. He is saying something, and I am para- phrasing, something to the effect that \"you are accepting this position as the King of England for Jehovah. You are sitting on the throne of David. And this is Jehovah's throne, God's king- dom, therefore, you are the Messiah over the United Kingdom - God's united kingdom.\" Now, to truly understand God's \"united king dom,\" (and we're talking about the Kingdom of God), we must go back to Egypt. Now, we have some serious problems here. The United States government is being ruled from the \"White House,\" the gov- ernment of England is being ruled from wh at is called \"Whitehall,\" and Whitehall, like our White House, is the symbol of pow er because the hall is like the Masonic hall, the lodge hall, the union hall. For Jehovah's Witnesses it is the Kingdom Hall, and it is the Kingdom because Jehovah's Witn esses, like their Mormon brothers, the Seventh Day Adventist, Christadelphians, Wo rld Wide Church of God, all of those groups are British Israelite Masonic cults. Organized, directed and financed by "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"26 Freemasons of the York Rite class. Freemasonry gave birth to the Morm on Church, Seventh Day Adventist, Christad elphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a host of other cults and groups which can be considered to be British Israel Masonic cults, who are going about telling everyone that there is going to be a new king- dom and a New World Order, and that white folks are going to rule th e world. That's why the blacks are not looked upon very highly in the Mormon Church, or anywhere else in America, because this is a white man's country. It has to do with where we come from in England, and with God's kingdom and the United Kingdom, and the kingdom that is coming is going to be ruled by white men. This is the ideology coming through the New World Order, coming through the secret societies, taking from the ancient religions and implementing their diabol ical agendas, through the secret societies, th rough the various reli- gious sects. The shock troupes, and the people who are introduced to the Masonic Order, the religious groups are given the out of cover of Jesus, and the wonderful story. What you don't know is that this is just a story that is actually being used to dupe and distract you from the truth. The whole New World Order agenda is being used as a front for a very sinister move- ment in the world, for world domination. It doesn't have a thing to do with anything holy, it has to do with politics. There are some very powerful families fighting to see who is going to own you, that's about what it amounts to, who is going to own you and your families. There is violent philoso- phy in Rome, as they want to continue their world domination from the old world, in oppo- sition to the New World Order. We have New York, the Empire State (like the Roman Empire), and the United Nations is based in New York. Freemasonry, once it is totally disas- sembled, and you look at all the parts, is noth- ing more than eclectic Judaism. It is a form of Judaism, it is not Judaism at all, but a form of Judaism that using Judaic symbols and emblems. So, it is not actually Jewish, but is based on the old cabalistic Jewish system. Again, I want to overemphasize here, that I am not talking about the regular, normal Freemasonry here - please keep this upper most in your mind - all the Masons I know are fine people. I am not talking about the Masons that you live next door to. I am talking about a very secret occult society that rules this world from "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"27 behind the scenes. And, as I have said many times before, don't look at the Mafi a for being evil. You had better look at the real criminals, the real criminals are the ones you are never going to see. You are never going to see them, hear them, or have any- thing to do with them directly. They are so deeply embedded in the ancient world, and in the modern day world you will never know who they are. You can get a taste of that from the movie JFK, but that doesn't even begin to tell the story. Many con- flicts going on today in the Middle East have to do with the Masonic Order, as King Hussein of Jordan is heavily into the Masonic Order. One of the groups is called the Cedars of Lebanon. It is a Masonic group. We have a hospital in Los Angeles called the Cedars of Lebanon. In the Middle East there is a secret society called the Cedars of Lebanon. It has nothing to do with those pretty trees, it has to do with a secret group of men called the Cedars of Lebanon. Somebody is using us. The business of banking was set up in the year 1099. An income tax form is a 1099. Who decided on that? Think about it. What can we do about this? William Randolph Hearst, the American newspaper pub- lisher, said, \"Any man who has the brains to think, and the nerve to act for the benefit of the country, is always con- sidered a radical by those who are conten t with stagnation a nd willing to endure their own disaster.\" I am not willing to e ndure my own disaster. The things that are going down, like AIDS being a blood born disease, the blessing in your blood, is the ideology from ancient times. In 1953, in the Fall, Norman Dodd was Director for the Reese Committee. The Reese Committe e was set up to investigate the foun- dations, those fine admirable foundations , like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Warburg Foundation, and all those back East foundations, with their hundreds of millions of dollars that we don't know an ything about. According to the record, a man name Rowan Gaither, who was the Presid ent of the Ford Foundation, met with Norman Dodd and told him this. \"Mr. Dodd, all of us at the policy making level have had experience in the OSS or with the European Economic Administration, with directives from the White House. We operate here today under those directives "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"28 A cardinal of the Catholic Church meet s with Adolph Hitle r. Germany kept friendly relations with the Vatican throughout World War II. from the White House,\" When he was asked by Mr. Dodd, \"What directives have you been operating under?\" President Gaith er replied, \"The substance of those directives as foundations, were that we shall use our grant making powers to so alter our United States so that we can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union in the near future.\" Is there something going on here that we don't know about, in this New World Order? I would like to advise the reader to understand what we are not doing. We are not trying to put down anyone's faith, or relig ion, what we are trying to do is get to the bottom of what we are dealing with in the world today. If whatever we believe is not true, then we had be tter find out and get to the bottom line, because we are all on this planet together, and if we are part of something that isn't true, it would behoove us to find out about it now. That is what I am hoping to be able to accom- plish. In 1959 I began a study of religio-political philosophy, which turned into a life- time of investigative research into this subject. When I was just a little kid a mem- ber of my family was a part of the team at the Vatican in the Vatican's Secretary of State Office. And, on occasion, when he woul d come to the United States to visit our family he would sit and talk for hour s about all of the intrigue going on con- cerning world affairs of state. So, as a little kid I was hearing this kind of material about the fascinating subjects related to secret societies and fraternal orders. I know a lot of people don't know very mu ch about the Vatican, The Vatican is a country unto itself. A very powerful country, politically speaking. Heads of State from all over the world come to the Vatican to pay homage to the Papacy. The Papacy plays a very, very important role in international politics and it has always been able to demonstrate this immense pow er in world affairs. However, what is most interesting, is that a new devel opment has been emerging that concerns an "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"29 Hitler meeting with the ar ch bishop of Germany. The politics of war required the cooperation of religion. Hitler opposed the Jews, but note the Papal headdress. occult Freemasonic order, operating under the name of P-2, or Propaganda Due. It is made up of some of the most profound ly significant, right wing, fascist, Freemasonic figures in all of Europe. Th is is actually true, because the man who was the Grand Master of this Masonic or der (P-2), Licio Gelli, was invited by Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign to appear at his inauguration. There are pictures of Ronald Reagan with Licio Ge lli. Gelli supported the fascist Mussolini in World War II, then was forced to flee to Argentina, where he supported dictator Juan Peron. Gelli finally returned to Italy in the 1960s and that is when he joined the Grande Oriente, as it was known in Italy, meaning the Masonic Order of Freemasonry. With the support of the Gra nde Oriente, Gelli was cleared for the his war crimes that he'd been charged with. Gelli, as Grand Master of P-2, made it the most violent and powerful secr et political organization in Italy. A former U.S. intel- ligence officer who became involved with the group called P-2 \"a state within a state.\" Much like the Vatican. There are clea rly \"political ties\" between these organ- izations and world governments - as evid enced by Gelli and Reagan. We don't nor- mally see them on the surface. Europe is a very small world and so is America. There are many important connections betw een Europe and America, but they are often hidden, below the surface. I know. I grew up listening to it among private family members. Let me explain something that you might find quite interesting. We're hearing a lot about this New World Order that former President George Bush originally kept talking about. Europe was the \"Old World\" an d America, of course , after it was dis- covered, was known as the \"N ew World.\" In the \"Old World,\" Europe was domi- nated by the Vatican. The Vatican domina ted Europe and Eur ope dominated the world. It was said that the power behind the Vatican was an order of Freemasonry and believe me, the more one looks into it, the more truth to this fact emerges. It was an occult order of Fr eemasonry operating from behi nd the scenes, and thereby exercising influence over Eu ropean politics. Now, that was an old order, like the "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"30 Masonic Order, or an order of priesthood. It was commonly known as a fraternal order. This group, this very small group of people actually \"ran the show.\" Yes, from behind the scenes, with the Vatican out in front as the front organization. The Vatican representing religion would be untouc hable. And, of course you wouldn't want to do anything to harm or interfere with God's will. The power behind the Vatican throne for the past fifteen or sixteen hundred years has been referred to in circles as the \"Old World Order.\" It was the \"Order\" of the \"Old World.\" Then, when the Unite d States was discovered - we've become know as the \"New World.\" And, therefore there are now religio-political fraternal orders which dominate our country. And thr ough us, dominate the world. And, that is a \"New World Order.\" So, when we hear the word \"order,\" they are talking about a fraternal order, like an order of priesth ood, or a Masonic Order. This \"New World Order\" is operating out of our country. What you have to remember too, when you say religio-political movement, there has never been a religious movement, throughout the world, that didn't have a little politics involved in it. There has ne ver been a political movement that was- n't a little bit religious. As a matter of f act, at one time in the ancient world, gov- ernment was religion. And religion was government. Today, in our modern world we are not really aware of that. We naively think that things have always been the way they are in the United St ates. But, this is not so. There is a profound connec- tion between religion and politics, even in ou r country. We ostensibly say that we on the outside of these powerful organizatio ns, believe that there is a separation of church and state. The American armed forces hire Chaplains. They become officers in the military. Therefore, they are paid religious leaders to represent God for the government. You have to reme mber that when you get ma rried, you don't go before God for your marriage. You go before th e State and you get a license, before you can talk to God about marriage. And, if your marriage doesn't work out, you don't go to God and talk to him about it, you go to the courts, because that's where the real power is contained. To draw the point out again, that th ere is a connection between church and state, just think about the c hurch arena. Inside of the c hurch is just like inside a courtroom. Symbols are like letters of an alphabet. You put them together and they spell a word, and you put enough of them together and you've got the story. Today, we have the symbol of ARCO, which is the Ma sonic square, which goes back to Jason and the ARCO-naughts (argonauts). Thes e symbols are images that we may not know the full story about. But, look at thes e emblems in the oil companies, on cig- arette packages, and on food items, and auto mobile emblems; they are all classic examples. It has been said that the emblems and symbols dwell deep within the collective unconscious. So, this is not just a coincide nce that they happen to be religious, and they also happen to be political. They ar e also used in advertising campaigns. Everybody is using the same symbols. There are only a finite number of symbols that make any sense, so everybody is going to use them. Governmental politics is actually a busin ess, a business that has been around a very long time. America is big business, originally founded as a business corpora- tion. The original thirteen colonies were not called colonies. They were called com- panies. That's why in corporate law every corporation must have a president and a vice president. And, we have a president and a vice president of our corporation - our country. This county, the United States of America is a business. Or, at least it was, as even the U.S. business can show a loss, or whatever. So, there is much chi- canery going on both in politics and religion. When you have a financial loss, just remember that there is just so much mone y out there - out in the world. And, if somebody is losing it, that means it is going somewhere. Therefore, someone is "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"31 The biblical Ark of the Covenant has its origins in the ancient Egyptian \"Ark of the Law.\" making it. When you see a big stock market crash and everyone loses their money, then somebody else just made a lot of money. Really all that amounts to is that this huge amount of money just changed hands. That is what is happening today. Our country is in bad economic straits b ecause somebody is hoarding all the money. I have an opinion as to who hoards all the money, but I am not going to express it here. I don't feel I have to do that. I th ink we all understand the Golden Rule, \"He who has all the gold makes the rules.\" Th ere is no real power among the people of this country. There never has been. We unde rstand that the political setup in this country is identical to many in the ancient world. Just know that the movie being enacted on the screen of the world is not actually what is going on, but that there are people behind the screen - behind the s cenes, that are actually manipulating the play or movie that most people do not know anything about. Let's take some of the major religions and find out what is really going on. Even our motion pictures reflect an occult story, they are telling this story. For example, the ancient magical priests of the Celtics had magic wands. And, the magic wands were used to dupe people or to work their magic on them. Magic wands were always made out of holly wood. Consequently, our masters still use Hollywood to manipulate our thinking and to tell us stories. There is a tremendous amount of symbolism in our motion pictures today. There was such a thing as the \"Ark of the Law.\" It was a box with two handles on it; it had the two winged angels on it, just as we see today in pictures of the Ark of the Covenant of the ancient Hebrews. But thousands of years before the Hebrew nation ever existed we have the \"Ark of the Law\" of ancient Egypt. That ark was symbolic for a very powerful force that Eg ypt was able to dominate the world with. With the coming of Western man, the concepts and ideas coming out of Egypt were adopted. The same magic is being used today, such as in Washington, DC. We see the obelisk, right there in Washington, and it has a very profound meaning that dates "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"32 back to ancient Egypt. And on the back of a one dollar bill we see a pyramid with an all seeing eye. Pyramids are found in Egypt. Among esoteric circles throughout the world today, America is referred to as the new Egypt. The coming of the new Egypt. All of American's political, reli- gious, and philosophical systems originat- ed in Egypt. Most people are not aware of that fact. There are some very important things going on that we have just not been kept informed about. Let me first say, that I am in no way finding fault with - or knocking Christianity. I am saying though, that the religious philosophy that we refer to as Christianity was in fact, at one time already in existence. The basic theme of Christianity was already in existence in all the ancient empires - especially Egypt. It is interesting to know that a man hanging on a cross was never pictured in the first four hundred years of Christianity. They never had a symbol, or an emblem, or a picture anywhere in Christianity of a man hanging on a cross. It was always pictured as a lamb - or a sheep carrying a cross. It was not until the sixth century at one of the great ecumenical councils th at it was decided that we should have a man hanging on the cross. That's where the concept of a man hanging on a cross was begun. There was a man named Jesus. This is historical fact - there was a man named Jesus. His correct name in Hebrew was Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, or Joshua, son of the panther. He lived approximately one hundred years before the Jesu s of the Bible would have lived. This man was a teacher of the Essene religion, He was a great teacher. He was a healer, etc. But, a religion grew up in the Roman Empire that we have come to know today as Christianity. I am saying that Christianity is, in fact, another expression of a far more ancient religious philosophy that ha s all of the earmarks of being one more retelling of the story. That's why the Bible is referred to as the Greatest Story Ever Told. Even the Babylonians had their holy man come down from the holy moun- tain with their tablets of stone. They ha d their Messiah that died on the cross and who died on the upright tree and who was buried and who was born again after three days., etc. This doesn't lessen or in any way take away from the story. No. Not in any way. This is not saying that Jesus was not the Christ. What I am saying, though, is that the story may not necessarily be exactly what we think it is. There is a history to religion that we are not often treated to, especially in America. We are fond of say- ing that we have the freedom to think and have freedom of speech, etc. That's true. We do have freedom of speech - up to a certain point. But there are certain things that arc not accepted socially , that we just don't talk about. In my family, many years ago, we just didn't talk about religion and politics. Politics and religion were "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"33 The Washington Monument in the District of Columb ia. The capstone of an obelisk is known as a pyramidion. off base and we simply weren't supposed to talk about them. Now that 1 am much older, I understand why. Because religio n and politics are very volatile subjects, and a lot of political and religious leaders do not want you to talk about politics and religion. All of this material being covered has been hotly debated. It's been debat- ed to the point where most people say, \"Look, I don't care.\" What's wrong with that? Because the more people talk about something the more they investigate it, the more a subject is discussed, the more it causes other information comes out. I'm saying it's about time that we do discuss religion and politics. I think there is a very important connection between the two, and its about time we look at that connection. I see nothing wrong with the teachings of Christianity. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"34 The all-seeing eye of the Illumninati, as seen on the back of the U.S. dollar bill. In fact, I myself adhere and believe the teachings to be a ve ry fine and funda- mental concept, concerning the way to l ead one's life. But you must understand that it is a story that has been retold and re told and retold. So, if you understand it cor- rectly - what I would call understanding Christianity - you would understand the basic principles that are being discussed, rather than hanging everything on just a story. Reason and logic alone would tell y ou that you have to ask questions. Did all those people back in biblical times go around with tape recorders or court stenog- raphers, and check every single word ev ery prophet spoke, or check up on every character in the Bible. . . what he did, where he went, and what he spoke? Did they have tape recorders? How do we know that every single word must be exactly that word? And, every single event must coincide with every si ngle word? There's only one way you could get a book to coincide and fall in line completely as a beautiful whole story, as if it was written as a story. So, that is what I ' m saying, the Bible was written as a vety beautiful story if you understand that that's all it was, a story. Now, there's some good history in the Bible. I am not saying that the Bible is not the word of God. I just don't believe that it is the only Divine book written in the world. If you understand that the world was, at one time, dominated by the Vatican and there was a World War - in fact, there have been two World Wars between power- "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"35 fill secret societies for power on this Eart h. One is the New World Order as opposed to the old world order. I believe that is why the World Wars have been fought. That's why we're having skirmishes all over the world. We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and money. â€”Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in Fo reign Affairs (July/August 1995) I have two books in my collection right now, one was printe d in 1969, another in 1972, or 1973...talking about how Yugosla via was going to be divided between the secret societies. They were going to go in and cause a lot of confusion and chaos and break up the status quo there purposely, in relation to this New World Order coming. So, there's got to be some connections here between what's happening today when there are very knowledgeable people that have foretold that these things were going to happe n in Yugoslavia. Nothing ha ppens by happenstance, but this is all being orchestrated by some small group of people. I truly don't think that there are a lot of things that happen by chance - I don't think the important things politically are allowed to happen by chan ce. Keep in mind when you hear govern- ment officials talk about crime and drugs, saying they can't seem to get a handle on the drug traffic and they can't seem to get a handle on the crime in the streets and they're just not able to get a handle on these serious problems. Just remember that almost sixty years ago the United States got a handle on Nazi Germany. They did get control of the standing army of Adol ph Hitler on the other side of the world. My point is that any crime that goes on or any drug trafficking that goes on, it is going on with the knowledge and consent - if not cooperation - of a very pow- erful group of people who have their reasons. It might just be to keep you fright- ened to death and keep you worried about the future so that you will accept any- thing that they give you - any kind of idea they will come up with to distract you from the real truth. They have the power to shut down anything they want anytime they please. So if something is going on, it is going on with their help, or they're allowing it to happen politically. This is the same thing that happened in Nazi Germany. Adolph Hitler told th e German people that in order to keep the crime off the streets, and avoid all the trouble that was going on, the confusion, that all they would have to do is elect him. Let me just say that I don't believe that the whole world is totally controlled. But reason and logic alone dictate the possi bility of that happening. Always, any- time a country goes to war or is building up for a future war, all countries picture their coming enemy as a desperate murderer, killing babies or whatever. You've got to generate that kind of furor (Fuhrer!) in the people's minds so that it will justify going to war with this terrible person - or a whole body of people in any given country - like Saddam Hussein. These hidden agendas are contrived by the media and the press. They led America, if not instigated the energy, into war with Saddam. This could be called outright propaganda. Although, it really is NEWS! It is called th e evening news. Of course, we see these terrible evil people (on the news). Then, later on we'll hear that the President has made some kind of an ar rangement with that person and give him fifty billion dollars of our money and then you see them patting each other on the back, to go off to their local Masonic lodg es together. But come to find out, this is a business arrangement. Yesterday, this gu y was our duplicable enemy and today he is our friend and we are supporting his agenda. We are being duped. Throughout the history of humankind the vast majority of people have been duped by a few that are in power. We sit here like sitting suckers, with a sign hung out on our front American lawns, saying, \"Come on, here is your next ready made sucker!\" Today, the American public - the plain old ordinary American public, has been duped from day one. And, we continue to allow this horrendous duplicity. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"36 A few years ago a movie came out that was called Network. In it, the network broadcaster said that the general view of the people was, \"Just leave me alone. I don't care about all of this. Just let me have my radial tires, my beer, my remote control and television, and I ' l l be numbed-o ut happy.\" Everyday the powers of gov- ernment keep moving on you - little by little, until one day there is no more free- dom. And that is exactly what is happeni ng in our country today. In my opinion we have already lost most of our real freedom to the federal government. What is it that might be coming? Henry Kissinger said it best. Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especi ally true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an \"extraterrestrial\" invasion], whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence, It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual righ ts will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government. â€”Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991 I believe that real freedom is in the mind. In the intellectual brain. That's where real freedom is happening. And there is so mething to do with our spirituality in the mind which brings freedom. That is the one place that the government fears most, you mind, your thinking. You ability to be yourself and do your own thinking, call your own shots, and be your own person. That's exactly what governments do not want for every world citizen. They try to keep you busy so that you can pay your bills, pay your taxes, take care of your house, and when you finish taking care of all the details of survival, the government hopes you will not have the time, or will try not to think about some of the things that we have been talking about in this book. And, if there is leisure time among much of the population, they will give you entertainment, to keep you completely distracted - anything to prevent you from thinking more deeply. Just make sure there is plenty of drugs, plen ty of entertainment, a little sex, drugs and rock and roll, and that will keep the people happy - keep them occupied so they will stay out of the way - controlled! I am not saying that people should not be able to do this. But, it would behoove you to get an education, read, study, investigate what I am saying on your own. Take the responsibility to find these things out that I am reporting here. Go to the library, check out and read something about the occult world, about how we are manipulated, especially in our politics and religion. I could provide you with a list of literally hundreds of very informative and interesting volumes on these subjects. Today, there are many secret fraternal organization that are interconnected. They have a death grip on world power, be hind the scenes. Our world and lives are so full of symbolism. For example, once ag ain, on the back of the American dollar bill, the great seal of America. It is fill ed with occult meaning. You will find on the dollar bill, the eagle, which comes from the ancient concept of the Phoenix, and has thirteen stars above it. The thirteen stars are arranged in the configuration of the Star of David, or the hexagram. Most pe ople think the thirteen stars represent the original thirteen colonies. In the first pl ace, why did they have to have thirteen colonies? Why couldn't they have twenty-seven, or four, or ten? When one under- stands that the number th irteen is a very important, profound Masonic number, and that many of the founding fathers of th is country were Freemasons, as well as Rosicrucians, then you will follow this connecting thread of material to see what was actually being created. They knew what they were doing when they divided "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"37 this country into thirteen colonies. The number thirteen is not an unlucky number for them. It is an unlucky number for you. The number thirteen comes from Jesus and his twelve apostles. The twelve apostles were the cornerstones of the new era, and Jesus is referred to as the \"Chief Cornerstone that the builde rs rejected.\" Twice in the New Testament Jesus is referred to as the Chief Cornerstone. Chie f Cornerstone is a Greek word that means \"the peak of a pyramid.\" That's why there is a little pyramid on top of a big pyra- mid on the left-hand side on the back of a dollar bill. That is a Chief Cornerstone. It is symbolic of Jesus. The pyramid also has thirteen layers. As a matter of fact, thirteen is all over the back of the American one dollar bill. I would have to say that the Illuminati, under their various guises and names, run the affairs of the world. Freemasonry is a very ancient fraternal order. For thousands of years it was made up of many different groups which loos ely fit into an asso ciation of builders, going back to the most ancient times in which men built with bricks - such as the pyramids of Egypt, and all the ancient te mples. They were brick builders. Even today we refer to one working with bricks as a brick mason. The trade of a mason, or the conceptual idea of building with bricks, was a building trade. There were men who did nothing but that, and they we re referred to as brick masons. They came down through ancient history and began to jealously guard each other's work, and not let any newcomers come into the trad e. They had \"unions,\" so to speak. We do the same thing today. Later on in 1717 many occult orders and many of the building trade orders of Freemasonry came together in London and began what we call Freemasonry, on the modern-day scal e. Modern-day Freemasonry was started in 1717, but the idea goes back to ancient Egypt and other ancient civilizations. If you understand that the ancient masons bui lt their world with brick, then you understand why today's Freemasons say of themselves that they are the modern- day builders of the world. They not only build the building that you live in and do business in, they are building the structure of the world, as Freemasons. They are building your religions, your political estab lishments - all you have to do is go to the library and get reference books on flag s, national coats of arms, symbols and emblems of different countri es, and different internati onal organizations. They are all Freemasonic symbols. Also interesting is the fact that a lot of the graffiti that is being seen in large cities throughout this country are Masonic symbols. Only high degree Freemasons would know that. A lot of the black gangs and the Mexican gangs spread graffiti around our cities. Mu ch of that graffiti is very powerful Masonic symbolism. This leads me to w onder how these kids know those symbols. I am suggesting that there is some conne ction between occult Freemasonry and the spread of violence and crime in our country. I think we had better look at some very uncomfortable, but very positively important connections that can be made between crime on the streets, and the elitist people that run this country - who are allowing it to happen. There's a reason. I th ink that crime in this country is being allowed for a purpose. A lot of people may feel this way, but nobody is saying it publicly. Now, we must ask, where is this going? Where are the occult orders that con- trol most of the important political and religious events of this world trying to lead this planet? I think that for hundreds of y ears there has been a concerted effort to lead the world into a New World Order - a completely new civilization where human beings will no longer be the same type of humans that they were in the past. We are being guided into a new age. Ther e is a New World Order that is being orchestrated. All the violence and destruc tion that we are seeing today is destroy- ing the old order in preparation for a new order. You cannot construct a high rise building where there is an old shack , until you tear down the old shack. Today, we are having wars and bloodshed everywhere so that we can destroy the power base of \"the good ol' boys\" in different countries, then a \"New World "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"38 Order\" can be set up. I cannot escape the conclusion that ther e is someone very, very high up and extremely wise and perceptive as to how to make things happen to bring about a certain conclusion. I tend to believe that that being or entity is something spiritual. I believe there is something spiritual happening in our world today. But it also uses men - powerful people. And these powerful men often get greedy, and may not follow their \"higher calling\" properly. They are only human, and power is intoxicating. I am concerned fo r the future because of the loss of indi- viduality and the loss of the human ability, freedom and the liberty to think. That is one thing about this country I am thankful for - that we have the opportunity to dis- cuss things intelligently with each other a nd give each other the opportunity to be heard because that is how we grow. Howeve r, I think that pers onal evolution is being stifled. More and more the governmental powers from behind the scenes are quietly making sure that people don't talk too much about things that are controversial. I think that human minds are being remolded, and reprogrammed so that people don't really have to think a whole lot anymore. We just go along to get along and whatever the government says, we do, what ever the church says, we do, and what- ever our assigned authorities say to do, we do. I think that that is where the real problem is going to exist. Let's step back a moment and consider the Vatican as it existed in the time of A.D. 600's. The Earth was regarded as be ing the center of the Universe. People were controlled by the Church. They lived for the Church. The only hope they had was that they would go to heaven, and not to hell. And everything else was basi- cally business as usual. That worked quite well for hundreds of years. But this sys- tem became rather difficult to uphold when people found out that the Earth wasn't the center of the Universe. Then the Church began to lose a lot of its credibility and power. Now, I think a few people are trying to gain similar power and control over people, but not necessarily th rough the Church. They are trying to regain such power through new secular means because the people have been in fected with this idea of freedom and liberty and individual rights to think for themselves. Consequently, the Church is not going to operate well. Churches never operate well in an environment where people are allo wed to be themselves and do their own thinking and call their own shots in their liv es. So now, instead of being afraid of going to hell, people are being conditioned to be afraid of total destruction through world wars, or environmental collapse, or some other terrible catastrophe coming, even an alien invasion. There is enough out there that some very brilliant people can come up with something that will scare the life out of all of us. Not to mention that nature itself can be very frightening with such phenomena as volcanoes, earthquakes, etc. And, I wo nder how much of that is man-made. There is a considerable high technology in this world that is operational, too. The underlying agenda has been control, and mo re control through fear. So one of the basic messages I am trying to get across is to rid yourself of fear. Rid yourself of fear and educate yourself. Become inform ed as broadly as you possibly can. Go to the library and check out books on the occult history of this world. A word of warning. The word occult ha s been grossly misrepresented by the media. Most people, when they hear the word occult, think immediately of demons and the boogey man. This is yet another way we are being manipulated because we are being told, over and over again, that th ere is something mysterious and dark and unnerving, and something very fearful about the occult. Everything else is okay, we are told. Religion is fine. But the occult o ffers something that is very dangerous. Once you understand what is going on, you find out that some very crafty people have not told you what they are doing and how they are doing it, and they are work- ing some real heavy duty magic upon you. You are nothing more than a sitting duck, because you don't understand the process. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"39 The word occult means hidden. That, simply , is all it means. Anything that is hidden is occult. I'm talking about the hidden powers behind the throne; the hidden powers behind religion; the hidden innue ndoes behind everyday symbolism. People who have accepted the authorities as the tr uth find it very difficult to accept the truth as authority. Authority does not always come with the truth. And, truth does not always come with authority. The bottom line is, no matter what you believe, there is a truth that resonates with your heart and everyone elses. There is a factu- al truth that can be pointed out, but you have to look for it. If, however, you go along to get along; if you accept your govern ment's view of everything, and if you accept your particular religious persuasion of things, then you are no different than the Hindus, the Buddhists, the Muslims and all the other people we condemn throughout the world - or those silly radical s who follow the views of their leaders and blow up buildings without asking ques tions. We may, like them, find ourselves being in wars and killing people without ev en questioning this authority, because they are doing it for the Lord. In what way are we any different if we do the same? What is important is that you maintain your own individuality as an intelligent human being, and do your own homework so your thinking becomes grounded in the truth. In this particular time in which we are li ving, to be able to speak freely, is going to be very important in the very near future. Our freedoms are being very closely watched, and are being monitored. There is the possibility that we are going to lose our freedom of speech quite soon. On this planet there are no passengers, we're all crew, so we all have a stake in what is happening in this world. Whether we want to deal with it or not, we have to face what is going on in the world around us, and especially with our rights as free citizens. H. G. Wells said that, \"Civilization is nothing more than a race between edu- cation and catastrophe.\" And, that is what we have coming. Catastrophe is looking at us from all corners of th e globe. Certainly, from the standpoint of the New World Order. The Talmud states that, \"If ther e is no knowledge, then there is no under- standing.\" If there is no understanding, then there is no knowledge, and that's what we have today. A whole lot of no understandi ng. It is about time for people who do know, to speak up. President Woodrow Wilson once said, \"If you want to make enemies, just try to change something.\" So, I know that anyone who tries to bring to the public the facts behind the world that we live in, is going to be criticized and condemned. I believe that there are enough people in th is world who want to know the truth and who want to be willing to stand and fight for it. Not in the violent, literal sense, but with higher moral values, upholding free ethical standards, and a deeper under- standing to be well-informed. Let me explain one of the main problems and tragedies in the world today. In the case of one who knows, or has wisdom, he is usually aware that he doesn't know everything. It is usually the man w ho thinks he knows everything, who does- n't know anything. One of the most important ways of learning anything today in our society is through symbols and emblem s. Emblems are like words. If you can't read the emblems or symbols, you don't know what the story is revealing. This is especially true in religion. We are seeing so much in what is said to be religion, and, in fact, it is nothing more than politics. And, of course, politics are religion, and religion is politics. There has never been a religious movement on Earth that was- n't a little political. And, there has never been a political movement that didn't have a little religion involved in it. I want to focus on the religion that is prominent in our country, and that is Christianity. Before I get into this subject , I want to emphasize that I don't appre- ciate anyone placing anyone else into a narrow box, or pigeon-holing me and decid- ing who I am in my belief systems, or where I am coming from. Because, if you "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"40 don't know me, you don't know where I am coming from. I am not a Communist. I am not a Nazi, 1 am not a racist, I am just a human being with something to say. T belong to no political party, consequently, I am not coming from any particular place. I am just a human being, a researcher, a teacher, and an investigative writer. I enjoy doing what I do, and have been centered for over thirty-five years doing what I do, and it's about time I bring my work to the public. Now we see in this country, on television, a lot about Christianity. We see Presidents, and Congressmen, and Senators, and everybody - all the Civic leaders are all into Christianity and going to chur ch and being fine people. However, for being fine people, we find that many are not really fine. As a matt er of fact, an hon- est politician, these days, is one who did no t take a bribe that he didn't earn. So, let's face it, our system of government ha s fallen apart. It is collapsing all around us, and the reason why is that it is built on lies. Perhaps one of the greatest lies, or misconceptions, and let's be generous he re to maybe identify some misunder- standings, is the truth about Christianity. 1 would like to deal with Christianity first and get that out of the way, because until such time as the people understand where Christianity came from, how it was organized, and why it teaches what it does, you're not going to understand the mentality behind it. And, we are talking about a white mentality. If we go back, say ten to fifteen thousand years ago into the ancient world, you should understand that they didn't have the modern-day conveniences that we do. They didn't have the television to occupy their time and waste their lives. They did- n't have the nice warm homes and cars and all such things to keep them occupied. Those were very hostile times in an inhospit able world. It was fearful and cold, and very difficult for human beings to survive. Most especially in Europe. Most adults died from around twenty-five to thirty year s of age. It was a very hostile world for humans to live, to eke out the barest of existence. We are talking, again, about ten to fifteen thousand year ago. It was obvious from the beginning, acco rding to the best material th at has been provided to us from history, and that's the best we have from the ancient reco rds, that the first enemy for man, was darkness. The first th ing man realized that was frightening to his world, was just plain darkness. It was bad enough to live through the daytime, but when the sun went down it got scary, because there were predator animals out there, there were enemies lurking in the bush. So nighttime became very fearful to our first hominids. When you understand that kind of a world, and those condi- tions, from there you begin to appreciate how they percei ved the coming of that orb of day, or the Sun, as something to look forward to with relief. Because when the Sun went down, you got nothing to look fo rward to but potentially frightful prob- lems. And, of course, if you have ever been out on a cold night, you can imagine what our first ancestors fifteen thousand years ago had to look forward to when it got real cold at night. You can then appr eciate why they would look forward to the coming of the Sun, or the coming of that great orb of day. Now, if you begin to see how these philosophies would come into people's minds and begin to grow, and their childr en growing up would begin to accept the same philosophies and ideas and promote th em to their children, and their children to their children, you begin to see how the philosophy became one of \"war\" between light and darkness. That which wa s light was good, of course, because the light was usually peaceful, and it was go od, and that which was dark was bad. Thereby, this primitive understanding wa s the basis for this animosity between the light and darkness. Well, we know we have seen a lot of that, because that is carried over into our society sociologically, regarding the war between light and darkness. As I said, light was good, and dark was bad. The Sun, of course, was the light of the world, and they understood that. The ancients we re not stupid. They saw that the Sun was not God. They never believed that the Sun was God, but they believed that it was the reproduction of God, it was the offspring of God, it was the "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"41 closest symbol that they could grasp to represent deity in heaven. So they figured that since your son looks a lot like you, well maybe God looks a lot like the Sun, or that the Sun looks a lot like the Father. So they realized this about the Sun, and I am using the word as an Anglo-Saxon word today. The orb in the sky, or whatev- er you want to call it, back then was understood to be the descendant of the Father, who was the Creator of the Heavens. So, ther efore, they realized that this Sun did not belong to anyone, it belonged to the heav ens, or it belonged to God, so it was God's Son. Every morning it was in the sk y, or it was in h eaven, so, therefore, God's Son was in heaven. As I said, it was the Son, or the offspring of the Father. They believed that no one has ever seen th e Father. No one can see God, but if the Sun looks like God, then maybe the Sun/Son mimicked God. So, when you have seen the Sun/Son, then maybe you have seen the Father. Now, incidentally, it is interesting as to why the ancients believed that God was a father, because in the most ancient wo rld they associated the creation of the humans, the creation on the Earth, with the Mother. It was only until the coming of the early Roman Empire that the emphasis was put on the male. As contrasted to the African, which is based on the female principle. And even the Greeks borrowed many things from Africa, with one example being the Feast of Sophia, which was based on feminine wisdom. A nd, as I said, the ancient people knew that no one had ever seen God, no one can see God, but if you have seen the Sun/Son, you have seen the Father. The reason why the ancients believed this postulate, as some of the ancient people believed that God was a fath er, was because of rain. Rain was per- ceived to be the fluid from th e Father that gives a life, or brings life to Mother Earth. So, when Mother Earth is impre gnated with the fluid from the Father in Heaven, then the Mother gives birth to all life. So that is where the concept of God the Father comes from, from rain. The area that we call today, Israel, was in very ancient times called Cana. The people there called Canaanites, and they celebrated the great marriage feast, so to speak, between God, the Father, and Mother Earth, and all of the light that the two of them produced for us. This very ancien t celebration was in the Spring, and was called The Marriage Feast of Cana. This was where God's Son was symbolically asked by Mother Earth to draw water to ma ke it rain, so that the grapes could grow and we could have a wine feast, whic h was called The Marriage Feast of Cana. That's where that comes from. Of course, the sun gives life to us, and gives us our energy. It gives energy to all living things. Then, we eat those living th ings to give us energy, so the sun is giving up its energy for us to live. Just as the ancients believed that God's Son gave His life, so that we may live. The Sun/S on, of course, represented this, which is interesting, because the ancient Egyptians said that as long as the sun comes up in the morning, there is going to be life. There is obviously going to be life forever, as long as the sun comes up! Therefore, the sun gives everlasting life on the Earth - but not for you, only on the Earth is there everlasting life. Of course, God's Son is our Savior, in that He is risen. Moreover , the ancients said that the sun, as won- derful as it was, was not going to save an ybody if it did not come up in the morn- ing. If it doesn't come up in the morning, we are dead. He is our Salvation, He is our Savior, only if He has risen. And the Egyptians called that risen sun in the morning, Horus. Horus was God's son, that was the name they came up for him in Egypt. Horus. And, they said that in the morning all Egyptians would get up to see the Sun come up, like an Easter sunrise service, and they would see the Son/Sun come up as He was rising. You would go out to see Horns, and He is risen. That's why even today the sun comes up on the Horus-risen - or the horizon. You had better thank the Father for se nding His Sun/Son, because He is your life, and He is your salvation. Ancients breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the sun come up, because they became more se cure in their world. When they saw the sun come up everything became clear, and they could see all the animals, and they "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"42 weren't afraid of the dark anymore. So, consequently, the Sun/Son took on the posi- tion of the Prince of Peace, because ever yone felt much better when the sun came up. So, He was then considered the Prince of Peace. Now, as we've said, the sun in Egypt was called Horus when it rose in the morning. And that is where he had twelve segments of his lifespan - in the daytime. Half of 24 hours, or 12 hours of light. That's where we get the word hours, hours come from Horns. Hours, or Horus. So therefore, the sun would come up on the horizon. It is interesting, too, in the Eg yptian way of thinking, that there was a sec- ond Sun/Son. God had a second son, who was eq ual to the first, but was bad. If you are familiar with Eg yptian mythology, you would know that his name was Set, and, of course, Set was the evil son. He was da rk, so that made him evil, and he would only come out as the Prince of Darkness afte r dark - at sun-set. So, of course it got dark after the sun went down, so Set came out when it got dark and became the boogey-man who was going to get you, since he was dark. Therefore, that made him bad. Now you have the two brothers. Horns and Set, one was light and one was darkness. The original trinity in Egypt w as the three lifespans of the sun, or the three lifespans in life. Morning, noon, and night. With people we have the newborn, the mature, and the dying. This is where we got the original concept for the trinity. In Egypt, Horus was the beginning, the sun coming up on the horizon, which was the newborn. Then, at twelve noon, the sun was high over the pyramid. There was no shadow on the pyramid, so they knew it was twelve, therefore, he was called at that point the \"most high,\" as you couldn't go any higher in the sky. So Horus was called the most high. Therefore you have in the morning God's Sun/Son, Horns, and then the \"most high\" at twelve noon, and then at night you have Set. From there you have your original trinity. The religion has taken all sorts of twists and turns coming down through his- tory, but this is the basis for what we call today, Christianity. If you don't understand that, then you don't appreciate where the stories originate from. It has always amazed me how many people will under- stand Christianity, but not understand that Christianity is nothing more than a retelling of the same age- old stories that have come down through time. As a matter of fact, the Bible is not called the greatest col- lection of facts ever assem- bled. No, it is called \"the greatest story ever told.\" "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"43 The reason why it is the greatest story ever told is because if you do a little homework, you're going to find out it is the oldest story ever told. As a mat- ter of fact, it is the only story ever told. It is called astro-theology, the study and the worship of the heavens. If you go out in the night time and look into the sky, what are you look- ing at? You are looking at the sky. What is another name for the sky. Another word for sky, is heaven. Well, that is where the sun is at. At twelve noon the sun is high in heaven, so, therefore, they said that God's Sun/Son was in heaven. Of course, they never believed that when they died they would go to heaven with God's sun. At least, they knew that much. At twelve noon the sun was the most high, consequently they said that God's Son was twelve when he was in God's temple. God's temple was, of course, the heav- ens, and at twelve noon he is in the temple . That is why he was twelve when he was in the temple. Everlasting life came from God's sun. And the sun was round. It was a circle in the sky. So the ancients saw life as a round circle, \"the circle of life,\" which was pictured or represented by the sun. The way they kept time, then, was on a round calendar. Today we call th em sundials. That's where they came from, the round cal- endars. As a matter of fact, the Aztecs, and the Mayans, and the ancient Mexicans kept the round sun calendars. Now the sun ca lendars that were in Egypt were round and were divided into twelve parts, just as all sun calenda rs are today, twelve parts, displaying not only twelve hours, but twelve months. Each one of the months was called a helper to the sun, because it helped the sun do his job on Earth in that par- ticular month. Later on, those particular months were called houses, because in the Babylonian scheme of things they began to develop what was called astrology. So each one of the months became a house. Th erefore, the Sun, Go d's Son, the light of the world, who is our salvation, because he has risen, had twelve helpers, or twelve apostles. And the sun also enters into each one of those houses of the zodi- ac, or each one of those constellations of th e zodiac, at the thirtieth degree, and it leaves at the thirty-third degree. Therefore, they said that the Sun/Son begins His ministry at thirty and dies at thirty-three. This is very, very old knowledge, as a mat- ter of fact, there are many books that trace at least fifteen other major religions that have used God's Son as the \"light of the wo rld\" in the same context, in the same religious philosophy that was developed fo r the worship of God's sun. Yes, there were at least fifteen other major religions, ancient religions, that used the story. One of the reference books that documents this, right off the top of my head, is The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors, by Kers ey Graves. This is a great book for that kind of a study and is available through The Book Tree. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" The circled cross found on many church steeples represents the sun dying on the cross of the zodiac. The cycle of four seasons is also displayed."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"45 The sun on the cross associated with be ll symbolism within a sacred arch- way. There are so many interesting points that I feel are valuable to bring out in rela- tion to the subject of religion. Christian ity has always labeled these ancient reli- gions as being pagan, which gives a nega tive connotation. The word pagan actual- ly means someone who lives in the country, a mountain dweller, or someone who lives outside of a city. That name was gi ven to someone who lived up in the moun- tains, because in Rome, after Christianity was adopted, the religion was thought to be sophisticated. There was little sophistica tion to be found outside of the cities. Once Caesar became a Christian then everybody could be a Christian, so therefore, it became the State religion. So it was in hi gh style to be a Christian. Consequently, you were considered very intelligent if you became a Christian at that time, you were very in, you were modern if you were a Christian in Rome. Once it was accepted fully, and then it became the thing to be. Of course, the people out in the hills, the farmers, the poor people out in the country, on the outside of Rome that have lived the same way for ten thousand y ears, well, those were pagans. They did- n't understand a new \"take\" on things. So it became a disparaging remark about poor people of the soil, people who were farmers, people who didn't know all of this high-fangled, new religious thing that Rome had come up with as a new belief "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"46 The cross with the circle of the sun is a very comm on symbol, in both ancient and modern times. system. They were just people, and the working class people were called pagans. That is where the word came from in anci ent times. Anybody who wasn't with the \"in\" crowd in Rome, with the new religion, was considered a pagan. Now, let us get back to the sundial. The sundial was round because the sun was round. It kept track of the months because it was divided into twelve equal parts. While this might be dry religious philosophy being discussed, it has a motive at the end, so I caution you to not disregard this discussion too quickly, because it is going to get interesting very soon. The connection with the rest of this material will be revealed. Now, as we have said, the calendar was di vided into twelve parts, or the twelve helpers of the sun, and that is where we get the twelve apostles of the Son. The ancient peoples came to notice something very interesting, as they were very obser- vant. Unlike us, we are too busy these days to observe anything. The ancient peo- ple had time to observe, and they found out something that is interesting during winter, on what we call the Winter Sols tice. Up to December 22nd, the Sun had kept moving. Each day the sun kept moving on a little portion of the sundial. You could tell each day that the sun was moving by watching the sundial. As the sun was mov- ing further and further South, bringing on our Winter, they would notice that it would go further and further, until it stoppe d, and then they said, \"Thank God, the thing has stopped, because if it keeps goi ng its going to be gone completely.\" So, it stopped, and it stopped on December 22nd. Then they noticed th at for three days, on December 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, every morning it was still sitting in the same place. It had not moved any further and ha dn't returned back the other way any fur- ther. So, they figured that anything that didn't move, must be dead. Consequently, they assumed that the sun must be dead. On the 25th, they noticed that the sun had moved the opposite way one degree, so again they assumed that the thing must be "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"47 alive now. Therefore, December 25th was the Sun/Son's birthday. But before that they said that God's Sun/Son had died, and been dead for three days. Of course, we have the big celebration of God's Son being born on December 25th, the sun's \"birthday.\" So, now when yo u take that round calendar, with twelve individual months, or twelve helpers, or apostles, you divide the circle from the Winter Solstice, which is the middle of Winter, right down through the circle and to the bottom, which would be the Summer Solstice. You then draw another straight line from the other side and go across, ma king a cross, that is when the Spring Equinox, occurs, and into the Autumn Equinox. Now you've got a circle with a cross in it. That is why today almost all churches that you drive by will have the circle in the cross, mounted on the steeple. People normally don't notice, but look next time. It is usually there. The circle is the sun that dies on the cross of the zodiac. On the ancient calen- dar, you divide the Winter and the Su mmer Solstice from the Autumn and Spring Equinox, thereby creating a cross on the circ le, and the circle is the Sun/Son dying on the cross. As we said, the sun was born on December 25th, and every year they said that the sun was \"born again.\" Now, for you to be born again, that means that you have to go under water to be born again. Why? You know of the common Christian reli- gious ritual, that you must be baptized under water to be born again. Where does that come from? That comes from the fact that when you were born the first time, your Mother broke water and you were submerged in water for the first time. So, if you are going to be born again, you have got to go back under the water again. Nothing holy about it, just plain old life. And, that's the way philosophies came about in the world. People just l ooked at the world around them, watched the way things worked, and had to get in line with it. They couldn't make the Universe do what they wanted, so they had to get in line with it to form their religious philosophies and ideas from what was ther e. So, the baptism had to do with the Mother's water, rather than the River Jo rdan! It had nothing to do with the River Jordan (except in a symbolic way). Now for more on the sun. Light was always associated with truth and the lie was always the work of darkness. Theref ore, the Sun/Son was the light and the truth. And, He brought the truth and the light . As a matter of fact, it is said of the Son that He was the truth and the light. That is why, incidentally, that we have in our jury system today in America twelve jurors (or sun's \"helpers\"), who helped bring the truth to light. Also, about Winter time. Winter was alwa ys associated with death, because in the Winter everything dies. So Winter was always associated with death, and, of course, the sun dies in Winter. And, this is a very important point. They said of the sun that when it died on December 22nd, that it had \"passed over.\" We use that term today, that when you pass on, when yo u pass away, you pass over. The sun had passed over to the death of Winter, to the coming new life of Spring. So that in the Spring He came back to life. And also br ought life back to the Earth. So He had passed over, He had passed on, or passed away. The ancient Egyptians had a celebration on the first day of Spring, and they called it the Passover. They celebrated the Passover, because the sun had passed over from the death of Winter, to the new life of Spring. That's where the Passover ritual comes from. On the first day of Spring all of a sudden everything that is dead, now comes alive again. Therefore, God's Sun/Son is bringing everything to life back on the Earth again, as He is the symbol of everlasting life. And, as I previ- ously said, that new life is for the Earth, but not for you. The particular month that He comes back in the Spring with new life was, in the most ancient calendars, in Virgo, the Virgin. Therefore, it was said that God's Son/Son was born of a virgin. That is where that came from in our religious views. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"48 The old Age of Pisces, or the old age of the fishes, when God's Son feeds his people with the two fishes, is a little over two thousand years old in length. Each one of the constellations is two thousand y ears in length, in the astrological scheme of things. So, the constellation of Pisces began about two thousand years ago, with the rule of Rome. And Rome was said to have ruled under the Age of Pisces, the two fishes, and that is why we get the id ea that God's Son fed the people with the two fishes. The closing of this age also signifies why the \"New World Order\" is tak- ing power from the \"Old World,\" or Ro me, at the end of this Piscean Age, "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"49 After the decline of Egypt, Rome came into power and picked up many Egyptian ideas and cus- toms. It's just like every- thing else, everyone bor- rows from everybody else, we think we don't, but we do. One person comes out with a smashing movie, and four others then come out with the same general movie. So everyone bor- rows from everyone else, and that's true of religion. The only problem is understanding who had the original concept. All of this began in Egypt. With Egypt we are talking about Africa, and in Africa we are talking about black people. So we have each one of those ages being about two thousand years long, each one of the constella- tion ages, and we have God's Sun/Son, the light of the world, coming into the Age of Pisces with the coming of the rule of Rome. That is why the Pope has the fish's hat, the fish's miter. The hat of the Pope is actually the fish of Dagon, or the fish God of the two fishes. Now, we have been in that astrolog- ical period of time under which God's Sun/Son has ruled the world in the Age of Pisces for right around two thousand years. And an age, or eon, is a little over two thousand years in length. That means we are just over two thousand years into the Age of Pisces. The next age to come, if you look at any astrological chart, is the Age of Aquarius. Therefore, we are living in \"the last days,\" of the Age of Pisces. When the "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"50 Messiah comes again, he is asked by his disciples in the Book of Luke, 22:10, what he will come back as. He says to go into the town and go into the house of the man with the water pitcher. So here is the S un/Son, symbolized in Pisces, and the rest of the astrological \"signs\" (12 \"disciples \") are asking him what he will do next, when he gets to the end of Age of Pisces . We are now going into the age of the man with the water pitcher. The man with the water pitcher is the symbol for Aquarius. Again, I have to say that the Bible is filled with astrology. It is not known for astrol- ogy, and that is what we have to qualify. Once you look at it differently, the sym- bolism becomes obvious and it is all over the place. The Bibl e writers knew exact- ly what they were doing. Of course, ministers never point this out on Sundays in church. In Christianity they denounce astrology as being evil. Christ ians say that astrology is evil and bad. from the Devil. Add a \"d\" to evil, and you have Devil. Take an \"o\" out of good, and you have God. In the Old Testament, Moses says to God's people to have noth- ing to do with astrologers, with those who can foretell the future by the stars. So we wouldn't want anything to do with astrology either. Moses didn't, and demand- ed his people have nothing to do with those people who could read the stars. The understanding of that is this - in th e Old Testament, there are four separate and distinct gods being discussed, but we'v e been unaware of that. This is due to the priesthood who put that Old Testament t ogether, and you weren't there, so you don't know this fact. The priesthood knew that there were four different deities. One of the four deities was the Sun, or Solar. That is where we get Solomon, King Solomon from. Sol being the Latin for the Sun, Om being Hindu for the Sun, and On was the city of the Sun in Egypt. Sol - Om - On. Just three different names for the same deity. Think of that next time you flip \"on\" a light switch. So one of the gods in the Old Testament was the Su n. The others were approached through the predominant cults of the time. One was of the stellar cult. The old Hebrew stel- lar group connected themselves with thei r God through the star s. Then there was the moon cult, or the lunar cult, of whic h Moses was the leader. So you have the solar cult, the star cult, and the moon (or lunar) cult accounting for three of those Old Testament gods (we'll get to the fourth one soon). Moses was the Hebrew leader of the lunar cult, while Jehovah, or Yahweh, was the lunar God. He was El before that, and that goes back into the ancient Semitic, which in turn goes back to the planet Sa turn. But Moses, being a worshipper of a lunar God, El, or Jehovah, naturally woul d not want to have anything to do with the other group across the street or down the block who worshiped a different God, who worshiped the stars. That is why Mo ses would tell his followers not to have anything to do with the star worshipe rs. After sundown the moon comes out. That is why Moses would have all the holy days at sundown, because that is when the moon comes out. One of the main reasons why the moon, or the lunar, was wor- shiped by Moses' followers was because the moon had control over the women's menstrual cycle. Since they were into sex worship, that is one of the primary rea- sons why they worshiped the moon. The old lunar cults were sex worshipers. This brings us to the subject of circum cision. Now, what does cutting the fore- skin off of a boy's penis got to do with the Lord? It doesn't have a thing to do with the Lord, it has to do with sex. That is why you are messing around with the boy's penis. They had the boys circumcised becau se they found out that a man would get aroused quicker, without the foreskin than he would with the foreskin. That was not new with the Hebrews, this ritual goes wa y back to stone age man. The Egyptians did the same thing, preparing boys for a little sex worship. We now are faced with a new scripture, in the Christian context, with Jesus, or God's Son, saying that in my house are ma ny mansions. The problem with this is that is not the exact translation in the Bible. The King James version mistranslates "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"51 the Bible a lot. You have to understand why, because the old British, the old Anglo-Saxon British, were not that keen on Hebrew and Greek. They did the best they could, but they still mistranslated a lot. They know that. Originally translated, it should be, \"In my Father's abode there are many houses. Well sure, there are at least twelve that we know of - the twelve houses of the zodiac. So, in my Father's abode there are many houses. That's what God's \"Sun\" was specifying. King James was a won- derful man, I know, but his lackeys just didn't know Hebrew and Greek well enough to translate things correctly. Later on we see that the Son is betrayed, and of course, He is betrayed by Judas, or Scorpio, being November, or in the Fall of the year. That is when the rays are cut short. Samson's hair is cut short, or the Sun/Son's rays are cut short in the winter, so he dies. What we are talking about, again, is astrology. We can go back into the ancient world for the understanding of many modern- day concepts, and to understand the Bible a nd the light of truth. We never quite revealed in the Bible what was always associated with light. The light was also associated with telling the truth about so mething, and if y ou have good knowledge on something, then people say that you ar e brilliant, you are in the light, you are enlightened. As the ancient Egyptians said, if you put the truth out of your mind when someone is giving you the truth, and is showing you the truth, what you are doing is killing the light of truth. It is th e same as killing God's Son, the light of truth, when you are killing the truth in your head, in your brain. That is where you are cutting off the light of truth in your mind. Therefore, they said that God's Sun/Son was killed, was put to death on Golgottha - \"Skull Place,\" as they called it. That's where the brain is, in your sku ll. Skull Place is wh ere you put the truth and the light to death. The light of truth, God's Son, has always been impaled between two thieves. There is regret for the past and fear of the future. We've always put the death of light between two thieves. The sun has been used by Kings, rulers, potentates - and every kind of ruler and institution worldwide has used it on their flags, emblems, symbols, police badges, just about everywhere. The sun symbol has been used by everybody, that is why it is called King of Kings, Lord of Lords. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"52 The sun was said also to have died with a crown of thorns. All you have to do is fly over the stat- ue of liberty to see the crown of thorns, because the crown of thorns is nothing more than the sun's rays. When the sun is dying in the evening you can go out to the ocean and see the sun walking on water. What do you see? You see the sun rays, dying with a crown of thorns. It is also said that the way God's Sun/Son left, is the way that He is coming back. On a cloud. That is usually the way the sun leaves, on a could, Normally, in the morning, if there are some clouds. He comes up on a cloud. The way He left is on a cloud, and the way he returns is on a cloud. The Bible says that every eye is going to see God's Son when He comes back. Well, you have to be dead or blind not to see the sun. There's a story about God's Son during a storm, the great tem- pest in the Bible. God's Son was sleeping and the storm was so bad that the men on the ship, the sea- soned sailors, just wanted to die, commit suicide, because it was so rough. But God's Son was down- stairs in the ship sleeping. Everybody else on the boat is going to die, they are scared to death, and He is sleeping. Now, I have heard about sound sleepers, but a man continues to sleep right through this terrible storm, and He doesn't even hear it raging. Just understand that the Sun does control weather, it controls the storms on the sea because when it comes out, the storms leave. The ancients knew this, they knew that the sun controlled the seas. So this is yet another story about the physical sun, disguised as an interesting parable that will give us all hope about the return of our \"savior.\" So we see ourselves coming to an end about what Christianity reveals. I just wanted to give a background, to show the astro- "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"53 theology, or the astrological aspects of the Bible taken from the ancient texts, Egypt in particular, and how these symbols and say ings have developed right into mod- ern day thinking. Also, how this has deve loped into a political ideology, and leads into some premises, views, and values , and of course, th e associations around secret societies. Now, we will finish up with a few more pertinent relationships to the symbols. One, in particular, is in relationship to the other symbols of the two fishes, which is Pisces, and then the age that is coming up, beyond the year 2000. That is why we are \"in the last days.\" Yes, the last days of Pisces. That's all. It is just that sim- ple, we are coming into the end of an age. That is why we are going to have a new age. They changed the end of the age to th e end of the world, for a mistranslation. Just as other mistranslations, they did this purposely. However, I believe that there is going to be a new age, and it is not the one they planned for us. I think there is someone or something higher than the \"high ones\" of this world, and there is going to be a new way of doing things. It isn't going to include the kind of manipulation, usury, exploitation, and the kind of stuff coming down for the last two thousand years, because we cannot afford another two thou- sand years of this stuff. We've got to clean this stuff up! The age before Pisces was the age of Aries, the Ram. That was when the ancient Hebrews blew the Ram's horn for the beginning of the year. The ram's horn was Aries, the Ram. And out of that comes the ram, or the lamb of God. In the ancient Hebrew they put to death the lamb , because it was called the paschal lamb, the symbol for the age under Aries, the paschal lamb, or ram. Then in the next age we have the bull, when they were worshipping the golden calf. They worshiped the sun as the golden part, and the calf was th e bull, or Taurus the bull. So the golden calf represented Taurus the bull. Then we see the judgment day, when everybody is going to be brought back to life and judged, that is the judgment day. Bu t this is ancient Egyptian, and is just another \"story.\" There has never been a judgm ent day, that is just a story. Unless you understand what the ancient Egyptians were saying, you'll never know the dif- ference. And that is that the day that you are living right now is your judgment day. You are being judged right now, and if you understand that, then you can go on and not worry yourself sick over what is goi ng to happen to you when you die. You are not going up to heaven with God's Son. I don't know where you are going, but you are quite likely not going up there with God's Son. The idea that Hell was hot comes from the fact that the sun was hot. In Egypt the sun is hot, a lot hotter than it is in ot her countries. In Egypt it is hot! They fig- ured that when the sun goes down at night, it must also be hot while it is going through the Earth. So if you die and go into the Earth it must be hot. Of course, when volcanoes blow up hot stuff, that proves that the Earth is hot. So if you go into Hell and you die, you go to Hell, and it is hot. You go into the Earth, it is hot. Actually, the word Hell is Nordic and it wa s spelled Hel, not Hell. It meant a place where you bury something - like a grave. If you bury something in a hole and cover it up, that is Hel, in the Scandinavian to ngue. Therefore, if you put something over your head to cover it, that is a hel - met. Because that is what hel meant, covering something up. Now let's look at the word blessing. Everybody is looking for a blessing. The word blessing comes from the word blood, or bloedsain, as an English, or Welsh word, blessing or blood, which means the shedding of blood. Any time there is a bloodletting, or killing, or shedding of blood, it was a blessing. That is why the Crusaders couldn't wait to get back to tell the Pope that they had killed all the peo- ple, because that was a wonderful blessing. They had shed a lot of blood. This goes back to the ancient world, long before Is rael, when the animals would have to be sacrificed and you would have to pour out the blood afterward, and that was a "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"54 blessing. As a matter of fact, the Earth t oday has been blessed all over the world. There has been more bloodshed in the name of religion in Ireland, and the Middle East and all over the world. So we are be ing totally blessed all over the world with this bloodshed. I just happen to think it is an idea whose time has come get rid of these blessings, and go back to school and find out that we've been had! Anyway, Christians will tell you that they have been bathed in the blood of the lamb. Now, nothing could be more repulsive than to be bathed in the blood of the lamb. But, that is exactly what the high priest in ancient Israel, and the ancient Hebrew religious philosophies would do. They would cut the heads of the lambs off, and then they would drain the blood and sprinkle the blood on the sacrifice and then sprinkle the blood on the people as a great blessing, and then they would sprinkle it on themselves. And, that is very holy, until you start to think about it, and see what it looked like to see an old ma n with blood all over him. That just does not bring up, into my mind, something of holiness. That sounds like animal sacri- fice and cruelty to animals. We would get a ll bent out of shape if we were driving along the street someday and saw some animal with his head cut off and see his blood out in the street. People would think that that was just terrible. But that is what they did in the Bible -just cut some poor animal's head off and drain the blood, and that was a blessing. And that is because we don't know what these words mean. We need to define the terms and educate ourselves as to exactly where our beliefs come from. Now again, I am an academic, a teacher. I am not a radical, I am not trying to put down religion. I am not trying to, in any way, offend anyone. I am just trying to get to the bottom of things, and incident ally, that is what radical means - some- one who is trying to get to the bottom of things. So if that is what I am doing, and I can be classified as a radical from this de finition - then I am a radical, because I just want to get down to the bottom of things. The Mass in Christianity is a celebrati ng of Christ's blood that was shed from His body. Eating of the body, of the God, is a very old concept, some of the most ancient rituals in the world would worship a God, and cut him up and eat him. As a matter of fact, Baal, in the ancient Semiticor Syrian scheme of things, was a God and they would make a cake to Baal, and cut it up and eat it. They would eat the flesh of Baal. Later on, they liked that so much that they started eating each other. They were from Cana. Therefore, that is where we get what was called the Cana Baal. Cannibal! Because the people of Cana would eat the flesh of Baal. The Cana Baal. The drinking of the blood always went with the eating of the flesh of the God. That might sound very holy, but what does that look like to us today? Just as Dick Gregory said, if you went home one night and saw your children drinking wine and having bread, having some kind of a feast, and you asked them what they were doing and they said, \"Well, we were just drinking some of your blood, and eating some of your flesh.\" You'd say, \"That sounds sick! What are those kids doing?\" Well, that is just what these people were doing in ancient times during their sacri- ficial rituals. They were eating their God's blood, and eating his flesh. These are the sacramental ceremonies that are going on in today's churches. So basically, what I want to say is that the defenders of today's Christianity are called apologists. And does Christianity have a lot to apologize for today? There is no doubt about that. It was once said by an ancient philos opher that allegiance to an old myth never broke a chain, nor freed a human mind. Most people will hear what they want to hear. They don't want to hear anything they don't agree with. But somewhere along th e line, we are going to have to deal with the reality that we are in today. B ecause no one is leaving this country. Blacks are not leaving this country. Blacks are not leaving this country to go back to Africa, and white folks are not going to l eave to go back to England. As a matter "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"55 of fact, there are more people coming into this country than are ever going to leave. What we are going to have to do is figure out what the problems are and be straight with each other, be honest, and get to the truth - to find out where racism and big- otry comes from, where ignorance comes fro m, and where this whole idea of dark and black being bad, and the Prince of Da rkness. And, of course, the Sun/Son com- ing up in the morning is the Prince of Light, so that is where we get that old con- text of dark and light. Over and above that, I mentioned before that we had four gods in the Old Testament, and I want to throw somethin g in here. There is a lot of good academic material coming out right now from universi ties throughout the world, and not just in this country. There are some very good academics coming out now to investigate the writing of the Pentateuch and the writings of the Bible. There are a lot of peo- ple looking at the possibility th at the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch, were written by women. Now, if they can prove that, that is going to set everybody back about three years growth. I wasn't th ere, 1 don't know, but I see some very good scholarship being developed right now , and some very good material on that subject. There is at least a possibility. Now, I mentioned before that there were four Gods, but I only mentioned three. So, I am going back over the four again. Th ere was the stellar God, the lunar God, and the solar God, and then, of course, we had Saturn. Sa turn is a very interesting fourth God, that is kind of hidden in the scriptures. However, the more you get into the scriptures and check out the words, a nd the phrases, you begin to see the words that have to do with Saturn. That is why today, when you get married , you get married before God. And the symbol of that God is the ring that is put on each other's fingers. The ring of Saturn. In the marriage phrases, one also begins to see what that has to do with Saturn. So when you get married, you get married with a ring, and the symbol of that God is the ring, the ring of Saturn. You're wearing God's ring. And the yarmulke was the round ring that you wear on your head, for Saturn your God. Even in the middle ages, in the temples, Catholic monks woul d shave their heads in a round circle, and the Hebrews, instead of doing that, would wear the yarmulke. But it all had to do with the round rings of Saturn. Kings would wear round headgear, not that that was more representative of the sun - but because they were higher, or mo re powerful. Just the kings would wear the round crown of thorns, and the thorns were then turned in and became the king's crown. That is why today, kings rule by \"divine right.\" It was to emulate the Lord, who ruled as \"king of kings, and Lord of Lords.\" Therefore, because they have placed themselves as king, directly under God, they can rule the land. Because they said so. \"I am the King, and you are no t!\" Now, that is the basis for tyranny. Let's get back to Saturn. Saturn was always pictured as black, incidentally. The ancients assigned black to Saturn, for what ever reason, and the symbol for Saturn was the sickle, like the Russian sickle, and on the tip of the sickle there was a cross. And if you go to the library today, you will see that the astronomical symbol for the planet Saturn was a sickle, with a cross on top. That meant that the cross overcomes the sickle. Think about that. Th at is interesting. But to get back to Saturn, being the ancient God, El, it was called the Ugaritic God, or the Syrian Ugaritic God, which is what we call today, Palestine. The north ern area of Palestine was Syria - and was associated with the God's name, El. Back then, the area that we call the Mi ddle East today was totally, absolutely under the influence of a more ancient empire , Egypt. In Egypt one of the original divinities was Isis. Isis was a male/fem ale progenitor of knowledge and wisdom, etc. So this was always pictured as a Mo ther holding a child, which is the same aspect of Mary holding the child. Incidenta lly, that is where we get the song, Mary Had a Little Lamb, because Mary had a little \"lamb,\" the lamb of God, called Jesus. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"56 When you look closely, that is where all those nursery rhymes come from in children's myths. Anyway, Saturn being El, was under the domination of Egypt. That whole area had its philosophies, ideas, and its people being domi- nated by Egypt. So Isis was the first main divin- ity. Now, with the com- ing of Ahknaton, the worship was then changed to the worship of Amen-Ra, the sun. This is where we get sun-ray from - from Amen-Ra. Amcn-Ra was worshiped in the temples as God's Sun/Son. At the end of the services they would say Amen, because they were sending a prayer to God through Amen-Ra, God's Sun/Son. So they would say Amen when they sent the prayer through God's Sun/Son. The ancient Egyptians said nobody had seen God, and perhaps, there is nobody who is ever going to see God. But when you have seen the sun, you have seen the Father. And when you pray to the Father, you pray directly to the Father, but you send your prayer through God's sun, Amen-Ra. So at the end of the prayer you say. Amen. God's \"son,\" Amen-Ra, served as a personal savior to them, since it gave them all life. The symbol that was used in the reli- gious context for Saturn, was the square. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"57 The sacred black cube that Muslims p ilgrimage to at Mecca. Black was the color of the pl anet-god Saturn. A square, a square box. And, it was black, and that is why Mecca is a great square black box. The home of Mecca is a square , black box. Because it has to do with the symbol of Saturn, which is square. It has nothing to do with black, because of Negro, it has to do simply with assigned color to that particular planet. This is an interesting point in that Central Africa was blessed with a lot of rain, and lower Africa, which was North Africa, had just about no rain. So that was a desert out there, and Central Africa was very high, and the highlands would get lots of rain. In the Spring when the rains would come, the waters would flow both Southward, into South Africa, or into North Africa, which I said was a desert. It would begin to fill up the tributaries and all the rains were flowing into Egypt. So, once a year the Nile would overflow, because it could- n't deal with that volume of water. A great flood would be flowing into Egypt, and they would always refer to it as \"the waters of chaos.\" That was a time of terrible destruction. Well, of course, a flood is a time of destruction. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"58 However, along with that terrible destruction, also came new life. Because if that water doesn't come in, nothing is going to grow, and if you think it is dead now, wait until there is no rain, no Nile - then you are really going to be dead in that heat. Therefore, the waters of chaos came, and the destruction of the world occurred in Egypt. Once the water had re ceded, and had deposited the minerals and nourishment, that would then be the basis of all the new life in Egypt. So they said that Egypt, like you and me, would be \"bom again.\" Egypt came out from under the water and was born again with new life. And they called that celebration the coining of the great flood. The symbol of that celebration was a quarter moon, like a little boat. It looked like a little boat, like a little canoe. It was a qua rter moon, the lower quarter of the moon. That lower quarter of the moon in Egypt was known as the word arghanoa. The arghanoa was the lower quarter of the moon when the rains came, the monsoon rains. That is where we get the Ark of Noah, or Noah's Ark. But, it is actually the Egyptian Ark of Noah, which was the wet moon. Noah's Ark. The arghanoa. Then when you get further into Saturn, you begin to understand that his color is black, that he was a God of one of the many different Semitic tribes, or groups, and one of his symbols was a square. Then you get into the square black mortarboard that the university, or high school students wear when they graduate. It is a square on his head, and it is usually black. The colo r of Saturn, one of the ancient Hebrew Gods. This is the same black used on the robe the judge wears when he is going to throw you in jail. Because the black repres ents Saturn, Saturn is the old Semitic God. That is why churches and courtrooms look the same today, because when you go into churches you sit out here with the poor folks in the chairs out here in the pews, but you cannot go up onto the lifted higher elevation, you can't go inside the gate, you can't go inside the little doors, onl y the priest can go inside there and offi- ciate for you. You stay on the outside with the poor folks. The altar is always raised at least three tiers, because in Egypt that was the way it was always done. The altar was always raised so the people could see the repre- sentative of God dressed in black. The priest comes out on the altar dressed in black, and he is officiating for you, he is the mediator between you and God. That is the same thing that happens in the courtroom, you walk in and you are part of the poor folks sitting out here in the audience, and here is the fence, or gate, that separates you. The attorneys can go inside the gate and they are your mouthpiece, to go talk to \"God\" for you and see if they can get you off, and the lawyers will be the mediator between \"God,\" or the \"judge\" who judges you, and man. That is where all of this comes from in our society today. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"59 Let's take a look at the word sheriff. This comes from the word sharif (like Omar Sharif). A sharif was the lawgiver in the ancient Egyptian world, and his symbol was the six pointed star, or the star of David. That is what the sheriff wears today, the six pointed star. When you get into all of that you open up a whole new realm of thought, because now our symbols on the streets begin to take special meaning when you understand that they come from the ancient Bible. Then you find out who the people were behind the old Bible and you begin to figure things out, and begin to see how these symbols all connect. Like the shell sign, for Shell Oil Corporation. It is not a shell. Look at it closely. It is the rising sun with its rays extended and is only disguised as a shell. Th is is not a coincidence; I've looked into this. This same rising sun is a popular o ccult symbol found all over the world, on many flags of countries and other important logos and insignias. The ARCO logo is a square at first glance, but look again. It is a pyramid seen from above. As we look down on the pyrami d, we see that it has no capstone. The same pyramid on the back of the American dollar has no capstone - it is there, but is pictured above the pyramid and is not c onnected to it. It is from that same van- tage point that we look down on the ARCO \"pyramid.\" You'd better do your home- work and find out who owns these oil compa- nies. We've all seen the Exxon sign, but not for much longer since it was just bought by Mobil. Few realize that the Exxon logo actually represents the \"double- cross\" of freemasonry, and we all know how it feels to be double- crossed. Let me explain more about the ARCO symbol. In the Bible, the twelve apostles are called the twelve cor- "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"60 nerstones of the church. Jesus is also referred to in the Bible as \"the Chief Cornerstone that the builders rejected.\" The Chief Cornerstone is a Greek word that means \"the peak of a pyramid,\" - the tip of the pyramid at the top is a \"chief cornerstone.\" So stop for a minute, and think about the message being so very subtly delivered by the ARCO company. Who is in charge of world, really in charge, with- out the \"chief cornerstone\" being here? Who owns the oil companies? And who owns you?? Now let's talk about Steven Spielberg's movie, \"The Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" They are raiding the lost ark, but if you go to the encyclopedia, or any library and get Smith's Bible Dictionary, page 23, un der the heading of ark, you will see a beautiful ark. It says the ark was the Eg yptian ark, was made in Egypt, and was purely an Egyptian idea. Now you can understand why Spielberg's movie took place in Egypt, with Anglo/American white folks looking for the lost ark with Nazis, who are also looking for it. The N azis represent Europe, as Europe is the \"old world,\" along with \"new world\" Amer icans who are also looking for the ark. Where are those two cabals looking. Hitler and Indiana Jones? They are looking in Egypt. They are not looking in Israel, they are not looking in Jerusalem. They are looking in Egypt because that is where th e ark came from, and they know it. But see, they haven't fully explained that to y ou in the film - it goes right over the heads of most people. Many, many answers regarding religion and its origins go back to Egypt. Now, it is true that there is something to this idea of the lost ark, and the holy grail â€” and Spielberg's movie of the lost ark, along with the next one, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\" provides clues. If you can't understand those two, then you sure can't understand the last one, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\" The last crusade. Now, if you can't unders tand the first crusade in the Middle Ages, you are not going to understand the last cr usade. Because it is the same crusade, and it's been going on for a long time. That crusade is very simple, and I am going to explain that to you. Jesus was referred to as the \"chief co rnerstone\" that the builders rejected. A chief cornerstone is the peak of a pyramid. ARCO's corporate logo repre- sents the missing chief cornerstone from an aerial view of the Great Pyramid."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"61 These crusades are between some very pow erful secret societies in the world, that make the Mafia look like Sunday school. They are very powerful criminal secret societies in this world, and they w ould just scare you to death. And, they are at work in our world today. They are battling for the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail was a cup, and according to the ancient t eachings, the cup was the Earth. The cup is the Earth of life, that holds all life, an d the cup holds all the blood. The blood on Earth is in the Holy Grail, so whoever c ontrols the Earth, controls the Holy Grail and controls all the holy blood. The holy blood is in the Holy Grail. Now, that goes back to this old idea about the shedding of the blood. Why are we going to shed the blood? Well, we are going to shed the blood to gain control. And, that will be our blessing. That's right, you are going to get blessed with the shedding of all this blood. The cup is the Earth and the blood is you. Now we can understand what they mean by the New World Order, and the me thods that are being used to accomplish it. We should understand that there are so me very powerful secret societies that are operating in the world that you have never heard of, because anytime you hear of anything going on in this world, you can be rest assured that it isn't important. Because if you have heard of it, it isn't important. It is what you haven't heard about that is going to scare you! Now, we are getting into something that is quite pertinent to this whole discussion. We can look around the world and see that we have nothing but problems. We're talking about war, racism, and dissension between peoples throughout the world. What causes this? Big business ma kes money from major conflicts and we should look carefully as to who owns these major businesses. The rule applies that only a few have control over the many, and these few are quite often connected to secret societies and big money. The majo r films in Hollywood sometimes give us clues because these same large co mpanies own the film studios. There's been a lot of information coming out in movies about these secret fra- ternal orders. \"Godfather III\" deals with a secret society of Freemasons operating out of the Vatican. But that's not exac tly where Freemasonry operated during the beginnings of the Vatican back in the Third and Fourth Century. They weren't around yet. Other power groups often influen ced the Vatican, and religious institu- tions were merely outward fronts for the power groups in control. We've always known - and have seen it in our own country - that the many public organizations, institutions, and churches are just \"front s\" for those who hold the power. The front organizations always operate in the light of day, while behind them exists the money, and the real power behind the scenes. It always goes back to money, because money is power. Those who want information on the secret organizations behind the Vatican might go to the library and look in the Encyclopedia Britannica or any other good reference book and look under The Knights of Malta. If you want to get into American religions, look under the York R ite movements of Freemasonry. A clas- sic example is Charles Taze Russell, a f ounder of the International Bible Students, later to become known as the Jehovah's Witn esses. Russell himself was a York Rite Mason. He went to England and met with Louis, of the House of Rothschild, and with the Zionist leaders. Later, he came back to America and promoted what he called Jehovah's Witnesses, and their concep t of a New World Order. They have been preaching in America for over one hundred years about a New World Order, the same New World Order that we hear a bout today. That's the same New World Order that President Bush was speaking about publicly. This is the same New World Order the Mormons are talking about in their gatherings. This the same New World Order that the Seventh Day Adven tists are looking forward to realizing. It is interesting how all of these groups just mentioned clearly use Masonic symbols that are closely tied in with th eir organizations. If the \"New World Order\" "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"62 should come down upon us, many changes w ill be made. It seems these religious groups - the Mormons, Seventh Day Adven tists, and Jehovah's Witnesses - are all vying to be the religion that takes over along with the New World Order. Some of the same Masonic symbols that they use we re put on the American dollar bill in 1934. These are Federal Rese rve notes, and these symbol s were put on the Federal Reserve notes by Franklin D. Roosevelt. He may not have taken credit for this, however, by writing a private letter to a friend named Colonel House, on November 21st, 1933. He told the Colonel, \"The real truth of the matter is , as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.\" FDR, according to his own son-in-law , was manipulated from day one. Curtis Dall wrote a book called My Exploited Father-i n-Law. In it, he stated, \"For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were care fully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared \"ammunition\" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, th e American people, an d thus paid off and returned his internationalist political sup port.... The One World Government lead- ers and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.\" Franklin Roosevelt, as history tells us, instituted a plan that was called \"The New Deal.\" The New Deal ultimately revealed that we used to be America, but that \"our enterprise was now a success.\" (This is based on this new money at the time - stated to this day on the back of the one dollar bill, in Latin.) In effect, they were saying, \"We have changed America from bei ng a free enterprise system and have now brought into world banking the IMF, The International Monetary Fund. And we have total success over the American people, over the American economy and the American people never even knew what happened to their rights.\" That's why many of the cults and movements acro ss America are promoting a New World Order. They are all welcoming the new Millennium, and attempting to position themselves should changes occur. The Pat R obertson's of the world (he's a promi- nent Christian evangelist), from all the Christian broadcasting radio and television programs are welcoming the new Millenni um because the Lord is coming back. Excuse me, but the Lord is supposed to be coming back. The new Millennium begins a new one-thousand year period that they think has some significant con- nection to Bible prophecy. I know this mu ch. The Lord might not be coming back, but you'd better keep an eye out for that New World Order. They're going to need an official religion, you know. And in ma ny ways, the New World Order is already here. The cement is hardening around your feet - you just don't know it yet. Just try to move, and exercise some of the freedoms you thought you had. Many of our freedoms have already disappeared. Christianity is a Freemasonic concept. Many Freemasonic concepts originated in Egypt. Freemasonry did not officially exist yet during early Christianity in the way we know it today, but Christianity is based on Freemasonic concepts and ideas established partly by Egyptia ns and partly by the old Essenes that lived in Middle East. That is why, incidentally, that we had so many problems getting the Dead Sea Scrolls out, because, in my opinion, there is material in the Dead Sea Scrolls that can cause some very serious problems with Christianity and Judaism. Much of the Scrolls have been released, but few people are studying what they really say. And contrary to what you might think, not all of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been released. As of this writing, one book, Th e Angel Scroll, remains under lock and key in monastery Germany. What remains hi dden could be damagi ng to those belief systems, and there may be a vested in terest in keeping it locked away. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"63 I am not condemning anyone of the Chris tian or Jewish faiths. 1 am only pre- senting the factual records of history. It is time that we become open to looking at all of our backgrounds, and where we came from, and come to understand that we all have things that we need to know about our origins. We are told that the New Testament ca me from the teachings of Jesus Christ. But Christianity is also the retelling of the most ancient stor y the world has ever known. The story of Christianity itself, as it has come down to us, about the one that Christianity calls the Christ, or Jesus, is not the same Jesus that walked on the Earth. There is a big difference between the idea in our mind of the Jesus of Christianity, as taught to us, and the actual authentic Jesus that walked on the Earth. That's why today Jews do not accept Jesus as the Christ, or the Messiah. They were the ones in the Middle East, it was their country, their language and their book. If they don't accept the story, there must be a reason why. The Hebrews do not accept the story of Jesus as being true. Here we have a religion that supposedly originat- ed in their own country using their own language, and they do not accept it. Whatever the ancient Hebrews were individually, or as a people, they were not stu- pid. They were and are very well educated . However, they do not accept the story of Christianity. So, if they are not accepti ng this story, I woul d like to know why. Now, my outcome is that I understand why. I have run this by many times with Rabbis in the field of theolo gy, the clergy. I now know that what I know, they know. Basically, what the Jews will tell you, and they are right, is that there was a man named Jesus, but that the name Christ was just a title, and he did not have this title during his life. Christ. His name was not Je sus Christ, it was Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, which is in the old Talmud, it's in Jewish literature, and Jews know about this man Jesus. However, he lived about one hundr ed years before the Jesus of the New Testament would have lived. The \"Jesus of Nazareth\" lived about one hundred years before the one that we read about in the Bible. Modern scholarship now tells us that the town of Nazareth did not onl y not exist during Jehoshua Ben-Pandira's lifetime â€” it did not yet exist during the lifetime attributed to the New Testament Jesus, either. There is much in the New Testament does not pan out. The entire story in the New Testament was written in such a way as to tell us a metaphysically encoded story. It is the greatest story ever told, not a collection of facts, but a story. I am not saying this story is bad, it ha s a lot of merit, but it is a metaphysical parable, it is a symbolic story. The story comes from God, but was contaminated when man got a hold of it and destroyed the whole principle, by getting involved with money, instead of with loving, and with God. The story itself is a very enlight- ening story that needs to be told, as long as you understand what is actually being related. There is a message that is enc oded in the scriptures, both in the New Testament, as well as the Old Testament. En coded in such a way that there is anoth- er deeper story revealed within the Bible itself. So what do I mean by \"encoded?\" In the military, or other intelligence organi- zations, a message might be received to relay critical data. The message says one thing, but if you take every sixth letter from the message and put them together, the receiver has a completely different message. One message is encoded within anoth- er. That is what I'm saying about the Bi ble, both the Old and the New Testaments. I'm not talking about things like that cryptic book, The Bible Code. That has since been intelligently discredited. I'm talking about plain English, properly translated, and reading what's directly in front of you. It's there, but most people fail to see it because they are taking things either t oo literally, or are accepting blindly what they've been told to believe, without thinki ng for themselves. All it takes is to look closely, and to think. Anyone can re ad the message of Jesus, but only a few unknown people can read the encoded message. Not only do I see it, but I've talked with many experts about this and they assure me this is true. That's what T am saying here, and that is why the Jews do not accept this bib- lically written story of the New Testament Je sus, because they are very smart in this "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"64 field of Semitic theology and they know the encoded message. Now, why the story was written in an encoded form, I don't kn ow. I guess you would have to talk to God to understand the answer to this monu mental question. Most likely, the Divine presented this information in such a way that you have to put out something your- self to get the message. You are not going to just get it, like you go to Sears, you have to really want that understanding. You are not goi ng to receive this under- standing by just opening a vein, and popping an IV, you have to really want to acquire this meaning behind the writing. Seek and ye will find, knock and it will be opened unto you, ask and ye will receive. Ask and it will be given unto to y ou. The whole idea is to study and prove all things, don't just accept the way things are, until you have done so. Hold fast to that which is true. The whole idea is for you to do your homework. Don't expect someone to appear and lead you to God. That will never happen, it is not happen- ing now, and it is never going to be that easy. Symbols and emblems are the bottom line of any revelations. Tf you don't know how to read the symbols, you wont know what the story is truly about. Why don't our world religious leaders discuss all these hidden agendas, why don't they reveal the truth about these symbols? Religion and politics are one and the same thing. We have been misled by our misleaders - separating religions from state, we all thought that this had alrea dy occurred. Not so! There has never been a political movement on the face of the Eart h that wasn't a little religious. By the same token there has never been a religious movement that wasn't somewhat polit- ical, and they affect each other more deeply than you could possibly imagine. In America we have a political ins titution running our government. Our gov- ernment is as religious as the Ayatollah Kh omeini was, or Saddam Hussein, or any other government of the world, including the Royalty of England. The great royal- ty of the British people is nothing more than politics. Getting back to the United States government here, the President, the Congress, the legislative branch, the executive branch, the judicial branch - a ll arc religiously based. They all operate within this hidden agenda of symbols and emblems. I am not saying that every one of these people involved in the politics of government is aware of this agenda, but there are the few at the top levels that know and hold this cont rol over the general population. On the surface there are the politic ians and there is the clergy. But, the fraternal orders and secret societies. Mas onic orders, of sorts, are operating behind the scenes. This is where the clergy can get together with the politicians at their fra- ternal lodge halls and talk over business, as to who is going to back whom during the political elections. There is a very important connection between politics and religion in America. Let me give you an example. Someone I know has a friend who was marr ied to a member of the Bohemian Society. This is a group of men who form a huge gathering for what they call the Bohemian Grove \"picnic\" in Northern California, once a year during the last two weeks of July. During this time, they open the Bohemian Grove up for one day only to the member's wives for an assembly of very costly activities. When arriving, everyone is picked up in trams, just like riding into Disneyland. The man driving the tram she rode in on, was black. Afte r attending the event, everyone is then picked up on a tram once again to be return ed to their vehicles, which must be left a long distance from the main Grove compound. All during the day of festivities she saw no other people of color, no other races, whereupon, she had to assume that this was the one \"token\" black allowed on the grounds of the Grove. She also deter- mined by attending some of the day's events, that the primary attendees were either graduates from the higher institutions of l earning, representing only such universi- ties as Yale, Harvard, the University of Calif ornia, or Stanford. Is this a \"picnic,\" or what really does go on during these summer productions! She also learned that a number of prostitutes were the only fema les allowed into the compound. But you would usually never hear of this information, unless someone had actually been "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"65 present and experienced what she revealed to me. Perhaps someone should infil- trate this fraternal order, just as they have done throughout the ages with other righteous groups, to find out the truth of what their primary hidden agenda is all about. Only the most politically and professi onally powerful are ever asked to join this all men's club. Think about it! On another occasion, when she attended as a dinner guest in a stately Tiburon estate, the female hostess began what b ecame a rather intense conversation with those present regarding the fact that wome n are never allowed to enter the hallowed halls of the Bohemian Club, which is locat ed in a prestigious uptown building in the city of San Francisco. The hostess proposed that a class action suit be served upon this club for sexual discrimination. My friend reported that she replied with these words, \"Most probably, not in a hundred years, would this 'good ol' boy's club' ever allow the rule to exclude women to be changed, in women's favor of being included inside this all male domai n.\" There followed a very heated discus- sion among the rest of the men, who were a ll members, of course , of the Bohemian Society, and the women present. Another time, when my friend went to pick up her former husband from a meeting at the Bohemian Club, while waiti ng for him to appear, there emerged two men dressed in complete drag, with make up, female attire, the whole effeminate regalia. When she asked about this episode, she was harshly brushed off by her then husband to, \"Mind her own business!\" Late r, she learned that the men dress and enact all female parts during the Grove's annual \"picnic\" programming, as they prepare very highly designed sets, costum es, and whatever else was necessary to present a richly created production. For these most opulent entertainment produc- tions, which cost thousands and thousands of dollars, the most famous male stars are included, along with many of the natio nal corporate presidents from the film and television industries. Th is is provided for these men to enjoy during these two weeks of totally affluent associations. These are extraordinarily organized times for major connections for the most powerful men in America today. Needless to say, every male member involved is white, upper class, elitist, and highly educated. I have color pictures of all the ex-Presidents of the United States at the time, standing in unison on a platform, which I understa nd now is a professionally designed stage-set, before a bonfire, with a large â€” approximately twenty-five, to thirty foot high owl - with each one of th e President's in a cape similar to what you would see at a Ku Klux Clan gathering. This is a specific fraternal order that they belong to and support, to worship an owl as the symbol of wisdom. They do this at twelve midnight. Now, I have to ask you, what are ex-Presidents of the United States, such as Jimmy Carter, Richard Ni xon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush doing there? These are all livin g President's - standing there in uni- son, the whole line of them, in uniforms, looking like Ku Klux Clan members, in front of a great bonfire, worshipping an owl. And of course, we've all seen the owl which overlooks the front side of the do llar bill, upon its perch in the upper-right hand corner. In many articles about these goings-on, th e research has revealed that the owl symbolizes wisdom, because the owl sees thi ngs in the dark. The implication is that these leaders of ours know something that you do not know, thereby symbolizing wisdom, because the owl \"sees,\" knows some thing, that you do not. The inference here is that there is something going on here in this country. And there is no doubt in my mind that we have no control here in this country. We all have to know that by now. However, the bottom line is that people are the power of the government. The people have always had the power. How woul d you like to be the King of Perdonia, or some other unknown, insignificant state, with seven hundred subjects, talking to the King of China? There is a terrible differential here. It is the amount of people that the government has under its control, that is where the power comes from in "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"66 _______________________________ The front of the American dollar bill reveals a hi dden owl in the upper-right hand corner (inset below). This particular bill also has an interesting serial number. America, and the world. That is where the power truly comes from, it is the people that have the power! That is the bottom line. Do the people really want a New World Order? Look at what happened in Se attle in late 1999 with the World Trade riots. Maybe that will tell you. Let's first go back to April, 1994, and look at part of a full-page advertisement run by the government of Morocco in The New York Times. In it, it announced the formation of the World Trade Organization by stat- ing: The Final Act of the Uruguay Round, marking the conclusion of the most ambitious trade negotiation of our century, will give birth - in Morocco - to the World Trade Organization, the third pillar of the New World Order, along with the Un ited Nations and the International Monetary Fund. Most of the those who rioted in Seattle ju st wanted to have secure jobs and feed theirfamilies. However, a few may have known why the WTO was started in the This inset shows the position (at the center of the pict ure) of the all-seeing owl as found on the front of the American dollar bill."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"67 first place, as part of this New World Order, and didn't agree with it. The people shut down the meetings, had them cance lled (although temporarily). People can make a difference, but only if they are educated, act together, and refrain from vio- lent acts. Violence gives a bad name to any movement, no matter how elevated in principal, so I'm not advocating riots. If the people, say three and a half million people converge on downtown Los Angeles, shutting down all freeways - black, white, red, yellow - that amount of people demanding that the Mayor come out from his office and go out before the public to sign something today, right now, sign something that the people demand - he would do it, you can bet your boots he'll do it, because the people are demanding it. If the people are demanding it, and the politicians know that if the pe ople are upset, give them wh at they want. Like Caesar said, give them bread and circuses. Make sure they are diverted with plenty of alco- hol, pacified with football games, basketba ll games, they've got Michael Jordan out there, and make sure they have liquor stor es on every corner. Make sure they've got plenty of dope, that they don't even have to go out to get any and bring it home. When you are going to rape something, it is better if you dope them up beforehand. You drug them. So, that is why we are bei ng drugged, make sure they have plenty of alcohol, plenty of entertainment, becau se somebody is getting ready to do a num- ber on us. We have been led into this with our eyes wide open, just as emotionally and mentally numbed out as they can arrange. Now this is a very important point I'd like to make here, again. As of this writ- ing, some of the people that placed the money, the brains, and the power behind Adolph Hitler are still alive. And those that aren't still alive have passed this job down to their relatives. They keep it in th e family. They are still alive and they are still working, putting something together called the New World Order. The New World Order of today is the same one th at Adolph Hitler was talking about estab- lishing with his \"new order.\" The New World Order is well on its way. Ronald Reagan did not go to Bitsburg to honor our war dead â€” it ended up being a Nazi burial plot, and the Jews got a little upset. If I had been a Jew, I would have been out of my mind that the President of the United States is going to Germany to a Nazi burial site, in his words, \"To honor th e war dead.\" There is a message in that, and you had better find out what was be ing connected. You had better find out. The Vatican turned its head during the Second World War, when the Jews were being put into Nazi concentration camps , and there were connections between Mussolini, the Vatican, and Japan. There are secret societies in the world that have profound power over us, and our politicians know about it. They understand it, and they say nothing because it is too frightening and dangerous for them to deal with it publicly. More than one politician has di ed mysteriously for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. All the Senators, and all the Congressmen have to know about these connec- tions. Somebody had to blow the whistle, and finally someone did. Adam Clayton Powell, the first black Congressman from Ne w York, a brilliant man blew the whis- tle on the David Frost Show many years ago. He died right after that, and he knew he would. He even said he was going to be killed on this television show. Many other people have, and I could give you names of Senators or Congressmen who have spoken about this hidden agenda. The drive of the Rockefel lers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, genera - tions old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. â€”Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"68 We have tremendous problems in our c ountry and they're never going to get straightened out. because the real problem is behind th e scenes. Our media is not telling us anything - the classic idea of what I am talking about with the media is on the back of the one dollar bill. The eye at the top of the dollar bill is the same eye that is portrayed on the CBS television symbol. CBS is the all-seeing eye. and it goes back to a group of Freemasons that came to this country before the found- ing of our constitution, who were called the Colombians, known as the Colombian faction. They founded what we know as Colu mbia University. Out of that has come Columbia space shuttle, Columbia Pictur es, and Columbia Broadcasting, CBS, with the all-seeing eye on the pyramid as thei r symbol. As a matter of fact, our gov- ernment, our so-called government, is not even a part of our country. Tt is in an area called the District of Columbia, It is a separate district, not part of America at all. The simple truth behind that fact, is that there was a section of the geography in this country that was set aside by a very powerful group of Freemasons, called the Colombian faction, working behind the s cenes during the founding of this country. Who are the Freemasons? This fraternity is connected to levels that go higher and higher and higher (most members don't know this). It just keeps escalating as it goes up. There is an enormous internationa l building in Switzerland that is divid- ed into three parts, which looks like the Mercedes emblem - with the triangle with- in the circle. That is what this building looks like, a three part building. One third of this building is the United Nations wo rld headquarters, and this is operating in Switzerland. Many people think that the United Nations world headquarters is located in New York. It is not true, it is th eir field headquarters th at is in New York. The main United Nations organization is ba sed in Switzerland, where the banks are located, Then the International Monetary F und, or the world bankers is in the other third of this building, and the last third belongs to the Freemasons. This was the set up for many years, but as I now understa nd it, one these groups has since moved out. But the point is for you to understand who is running tilings at the highest lev- els in world affairs, and why it's been so important to have all three organizations in the same building for many, many years t ogether. It's a matter of convenience for those who hold the true power. Do you remember the television show called Mission Impossible? If you ever see a rerun, watch the opening of the show very closely. What will come up on the screen will be the insignia IMF - supposedly standing for the \"Impossible Mission Force.\" The impossible mission force, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund. What were they always doing on the show? They were always tricking leaders out of positions of authority, assassinating somebody, helping people escape, or doing some other dirty deal, all in a war for power. Whose power? Of course, they were always working for some government, but the agents are not supposed to know who that is for sure. They just do their jobs, not knowing who's really hired them. The \"IMF\" just sends them out on as mission that they must perform, at all costs. And if anyone should find out who's really pulling the strings, then the agents are told that \"we are going to disavow any connection to you.\" Well, that is the IMF. The International Monetary Fund, which is the power behind the Federal Reserve System, which is raping our country and destroying our economy. And these guys are doing it right in front of you, telling you what they are doing, but we just don't see it, Even after they spell it out for us on television. They are even making come- dies about it, like Get Smart. On one side you have Chaos, and the other side you have Control. And when you watch the show closely, and ignore the foolishness, it is easy to see that the same operation is running both sides. Creating chaos, then rushing in to \"contr ol\" it, in order to accomplish an agenda. That is how it has always been done. GET SMART! They are telling you something. Freemasonry's symbol and motto is Ordo Ab Chao, meaning \"Order out of Chaos.\" It's found in any reference book. So I am saying that there is a world move- ment that is financing, organizing, and directing world chaos. Wars, racism, trouble "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"69 in Northern Ireland, may well be caused by opposing Masonic Orders, between England and the Irish mobs, the syndicat es. The Mafia itself is an order of Freemasonry. Sound crazy? The Mafia w as connected with the secret societies founded by Giuseppe Messini and Garibaldi, and Albert Pike of the Scottish Rite - it is purely a Masonic Order run like a family of Masonic families. That is what we have going on in the world today. Masonic families in Europe, the old Hapsburg families, the Rothschilds, the Ottomans. They are ancient fami- lies that are power groups, that have contro lled world power for thousands of years. They are continuously vying for power, alt hough the new thing at this stage is now this New World Order, which came into existence two hundred years ago in Southern Germany. So I am saying that a ll of these things that we are watching on the world stage have been intricately organized and directed from behind the scenes. And we, the American people, haven' t got the faintest idea in the world of what is happening to us as free citizens. There are three kinds of citizens in America. However, the people of America have only been told about one. We have purposely been kept ignorant about the other two. The first citizenship that a person can hold in this country is to be a cit- izen of the United States. That is what we are all told that we should be. There is a second one, and that is to be a citizen of the United States of America, which is totally different. A legally, constitutionally es tablished difference in a court of law. If you are citizen of the United States, you are not a citizen of the United States of America. When you understand that this country was founded and the constitution was written, it was based on something call ed international maritime admiralty law. We call this law today, world law. The World Court is what the United Nations operates under and is intern ational maritime admiralty law today. Our government was founded as a business corporation, as a company. All corpor ate law says that you have to have a president and a vice pr esident. That is why we have a President and a Vice President. We are told that we have the right to elect, and that is true, but we don't have a right to select, because the corporations decide who is going to run the business. We are experiencing th at dilemma right now, in that we can elect, but we cannot select. There is a very real difference in where the power is, and in thinking we know what is going on in our national electi ons. We have been given the candidates that the corporations selected, of whom they want us to elect. The entire establishment in America is a business, and you cannot imagine the heads of General Motors or Ford Motor Company getting up in the morning, hav- ing a cup of coffee, and wondering what are we going to do today, how are we going to run business today. These powerful male figures have to know what they are going to do twenty years from today, how much oil there is going to be, how much glass will be available, how many people are going to be buying cars. They have to be able to project what the economy will be like twenty years from now, because they have a million or more people on the payroll, so they had better do their homework. They are controlling the whole thing, and our government oper- ates in the same way. They already know w ho is going to be President, they already know where we will be headed . As a matter fact, someone who was very bright fig- ured this out. You can go back every four years to many of the encyclopedias that were printed the year before the Presidentia l elections, to that edition, and read that the President is already listed by name in the encyclopedia almost a year before the elections. How do they do this? In late Spring, when the encyclopedias are print- ed, it already shows the President that is going to be elected in that Presidential year, and he isn't going to be elected until the Fall of that year. He is already there. Nobody's caught that. But many of our encyclopedias and dictionaries come from a secret society of Freemasons in the sout h of France. Three hundred years ago they were called the encyclopedia dictionaire, or the old Knights Templar of France, and they were the enemies of the Roman Chur ch, They were the great progenitors of what we call the Age of Enlightenment, the encyclopedia dictionaire. Most "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"70 Freemasons know about this, they were the ones that gave us the encyclopedias and dictionaries, that is why they can tell yo u who is going to be President the year before he is elected, as it comes out in print in the Spring. We think that our leaders are so wonde rful, you had better take a long look at the rest of the story. This includes all the world leaders, as well. All the leaders of the world governments know there is a game going on, a paternal system of power, and it is called loosely, the New World Or der. As opposed to the Old World Order. It's the new game in town, and it's taking over. Better get in line. Europe dominated the world, so Europe was called the Old World, and, of course, included the powers behind it. The old European families, the Masonic secret societies behind these powerful old families, the Romanoffs, the Krupps - they were the power groups, working in unison, a power unit called Europe, which dominated the world. The Vatican dominated Europe together with these families, but today the New World Order is slowly eroding that power away from the old world. It is a massive and complex st ruggle that we never see on the surface. So where is this New World Order based out of? It is based in Britain and America. But it is mainly British. There is a big difference be tween being English and British, totally different. It is a night and day difference, as English is a blood- line coming out of the old Celtic peoples of the Nordic race, while British means \"man of the covenant,\" or \"holy man,\" as I had previously explained. Prince Charles is never going to become King because he would not go along with the scheme of things there, so their breaking up his marriage and making him look like a dope is the result of that. It s eems clear that his first son is going to be King. The powers that be do not want Charles to be King. Prince Andrew is the Duke of York, which is the head of the Yo rk Rite of England, which is working in concert with New York, the Empire State. It does appear that Prince Andy is not going along the way he should, so his marri age has been broken up and he is also being made to look like a fool. Behind thos e two men are very powerful secret soci- eties. The governments of the present day have to deal not merely with other governments, with emperors, kings and ministers, but also with the secret societies which have everywhere their unscrupulous agents, and can at the last moment upset all the governments' plans. â€”British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, 1876 So to this day, very little has changed. What do we do now, where do we go with all this information, this hidden agenda that incorporates so many world secrets as to boggle the aver age mind? Keep in mind now that what we are talking about is the Old World Order of Europe . Adolph Hitler was secretly financed, organized, and directed out of America by big business to destroy the Old World Order of Europe - to cause havoc in the other guy's back yard. This is now a proven fact. When Hitler had acco mplished what he was supposed to do, then American industry cut off his oil, cut off all of his supplies, and Hitler went under. Now understand that America is in the hands of what we call in America, the New World Order. Hitler, of course, was kept in th e dark as to this hidden agenda. He was a pawn in the game. So the industrial co mplex power mongers used him until their ultimate goal was accomplished at that time. What is their ultimate goal today? Their ultimate goal is to bring about God's Kingdom. Prince Charles, or whomever is going to be King, will be sworn in by the Arch Bishop of Canterbury and will make this new King repeat after him these words, \"When you accept this position as King of England for Jehovah, for the God of the Old Testament, you are sitting on th e throne of David for Jesus Christ, until such time that Jesus comes back, you are King of God's Kingdom. The Pope in Rome says, hey, there is something wrong here, I am suppose to be the Vicar of "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"71 Christ. That is why you have the great power struggle between the Old World of Rome, under the Pope, and the New World, under England and America. Who is going to be King of God's Kingdom? Well, as a matter of fact, there is no God's Kingdom - at least on Earth - this is politics at the highest possible level. What we are talking about are churches and governme nt on this side of the Atlantic con- nected with churches and government in E ngland. What you end up with is a mas- ter conspiracy here. There is somethi ng very big going on here, our economy is involved and we ha d better wake up. In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all. â€”Strobe Talbot, President Clinton's Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, 1992. We shall have world government whether or not you like it, by con - quest or consent. -â€”Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, 1950 The people of this country need to wake up and quit depending on the church- es to lead you, or depending on the great institutions of great learning to teach you the truth. They are all set up by the power mongering masters of our world. If this country, if not the world, is going to be saved then people must respond from the ground up, at a grass roots level. Individua l people, by educating themselves, their families, close friends and associates are waking up to find out that, no, the gov- ernment is not always going to take care of them. We have to stand on our own, and become thoroughly informed, and damn it, take back the country and our freedom from the powers that be.

He has appeared on three CBS-TV specials, ANCIENT MYSTERIES OF THE BIBLE, Parts One and Two, and ANCIENT MYSTERIES OF THE WORLD. Mr. Maxwell is interviewed here by Paul Tice, a write r and Gnostic minister from the San Diego area. This interview first appeared under the title of On Religion and Politics. O N R ELIGION AND P OLITICS I NTERVIEWS P ART 1 PT: Some people may not know of your work. Who is Jordan Maxwell? JM: I feel as though I am an ordinary man in the grips of an extraordinary idea; an ordinary human in pursuit of extrao rdinary knowledge. The knowledge that I have acquired began when I was very you ng. My mother's uncle worked at the Vatican, Secretary of State's office, and wh en he would come back to this country for a visit, he would sit for hours and talk to my family about secret societies, sub- versive movements, the political intrigue going on behind religious movements, and he used to dazzle me with the expl anations about symbols and emblems of occult societies. So I grew up around that kind of knowledge. My grandfather was a Congressman from the state of Florida and there were federal judges in the fam- ily, so I grew up hearing things that government figures talk about behind the scenes, with their family, which is a world of difference from what they say pub- licly. As I grew, I continued to research these hidden areas. I've been waiting for years for someone to deal with these specific subjects that are not normally dealt with. And since no one else has volunteered to do it, I feel a responsibility to speak up. PT: Most of your work is related to re ligion, although some family members have been involved in politics. What is the connection between religion and poli- tics? JM: If you go back into the furthest part of history, as far back as you can go, religion and politics were one and the same. In the ancient world there was never a difference. The king or head of the tribe was always mediator between God and his people. There's never been a political move ment in the world that wasn't a little religious, and there's never been a religious movement anywhere that wasn't a lit- tle political. Knowing this helps us to unde rstand the connections that can be made today, in our society. PT: So in our society you're saying th at this separation of church and state exists on a more broad or general level, but that behind the scenes there may not be quite so much of a separation there? JM: Absolutely. There virtually is no sepa ration of church and state - because, for instance, you cannot get married unless you get a marr iage license. You can get married before God as long as you have a license from the stat e. You cannot start a church without first getting government doc uments, licenses, permits. In the West, generally speaking, the political instituti ons were founded by the same political establishments that founded religious movements. So religion and politics are, in fact, one and the same thing. PT: But the main thrust of your work seems to involve religion more than pol- itics. Why? 73"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"74 JM: I prefer to focus more on religion, but politics is equally important. Let's look at the big picture. What I am working to accomplish is to make people aware that man-made institutions, government and religious, arc nothing more than a way to control you. To control how you think, to control where you go, how you view things, and what you believe. Man-made churches and governments were meant to control you. So you have a responsibility, not only to your own spiritual self (to educate yourself, spiritually, and take b ack your life from the hands of your mas- ters), but you also have a responsibility to your Creator. The divine entity who cre- ated you and gave you life, gave all cr eation freedom. Throughout nature, the birds and animals have total freedom. There is a freedom throughout the universe. The only place where we have a lack of freedom is in the human realm. We are the ones who are in prison, and 90 per cent of it is our own fault. We have allowed other peo- ple - our churches, our governments, our in stitutions, to do our thinking for us. And I'm saying that we are moving into a new tim e, whether we like it or not, where the people all over the Earth are going to have to break free from all the institutions and realize that we are all creations of God and we all have freedoms. We should have the same freedoms that all other creations have. Until such time that we get off of our knees and stand on our feet, and think for ourselves, we will not have the free- dom that we were born to have. PT: You pick out Christianity, quite often, as a focal point for this needed change. In what areas do you feel that Christianity is lacking? JM: Lacking or not, the age of Christianity is on its way out. Christianity, in the last 1600 years (since being formalized), ha s been symbolized by the two fishes of Pisces. In astrology, you'll find that each governing power was originally called \"The Lord\" over the constellation it represen ted. Jesus, \"The Lord,\" was made to represent the two fishes, but we're now entering into another time called the \"Age of Aquarius.\" In the Book of Luke 22:10 where the 12 apostles, or the 12 signs of the zodiac, are asking God's \"Sun,\" the light of the world, where he will go after he leaves the constellation of Pisces, the two fishes, God's Sun says you will go into the city and will see a man with the wate r pitcher, and go into the house of the man with the water pitcher. That is the house of Aquarius. There is an encoded message in the New Testament, almost all of it was written in an allegorical sense. That's why Jesus said, \"Many will look with thei r eyes, but not see. And they will listen with their ears, but not hear. \" Many have read the Bible and listened to sermons in churches for thousands of years, and they have looked with their eyes, but did not see. And they have listened to serm ons with their ears, but did not hear. PT: So the fundamentalist Christians are the furthest from the truth when they think they have the whole truth. Is that what you are saying? JM: Well, there's a scripture where Jesu s said, \"If you say that you are in the light, but in fact you are in the dark, then how dark your light really is.\" The point made is if you think you have the whole truth and the correct understanding, you had better make sure you do. Because if you don't, you are really in the dark. And my point on this is that humility is requi red to understand spiritual things. We need to be humble enough to admit that we might not have read the scriptures correctly. PT: Your career is starting to take o ff, and you are getting noticed everywhere. How do you think the church will per ceive you? And the public in general? JM: There's no doubt that many in the church, no matter what denomination, will perceive me as an antichrist or at leas t working on the side of an antichrist. But it has also been my experience in talking to thousands of people, lecturing in audi- toriums and before various groups where ma ny of these people were church-going Christians. And I've found the majority of them were favorably disposed toward me and what I am saying. They do not show themselves to be hostile at all, and seem to be impressed with the things that they're learning. The people who will see me as being on the side of an antichrist will be those who have something to lose. Those who have a vested interest, who are employed and might lose their employ- "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"75 ment. And people who are sincerely search ing for knowledge and truth never shy away from challenges to learn. And somethi ng 1 have learned is that truth can stand on its own, and never needs to be validat ed by ignorance and bigotry. As Gerald Massey wrote, \"They must find it difficult, those who have accepted the authority as the truth, rather than truth as the au thority.\" Those who have accepted our gov- ernment and church authority as being corr ect are going to find that when you are faced with spiritual truth, this truth h as nothing in common with those authorities. PT: Does this mean you know what that spiritual truth is? Are you hinting at having a monopoly on the truth, as many religions claim? JM: I believe that I am on my own path to truth, and with a similar under- standing, many others might find their own paths easier. In the Indiana Jones movie \"The Last Crusade,\" Indiana Jones is sayi ng to his class that if you are looking for truth, then you are in the wrong class. Tr uth is found in the philosophy and religion department, that's where truth is found. \"A s an archaeologist,\" he said, \"I am con- cerned with facts, not truth.\" And the reas on why, is that all educated people know that truth is subjective. Things that are true to you, may not be true to me. PT: That's true. JM: That's why in a court of law, we're not looking for someone to tell \"the truth,\" we're looking for what can be proven by facts. Whether you tell the truth or not. If you have preconceived ideas, that is a very bad starting point. How would you like to be on trial, for your life and have the 12 jurors already decided on your case? PT: So you would want people to approach you in the same way - with an open mind. JM: Right. At least hear what I have to say before you make a judgment. I could be wrong. And that's what I've always said. I could be wrong. PT: But if you're right... JM: But if I'm right, it means that the whole authoritarian system that we see around us is wrong, and it has usurped the pos ition of our Creator. The governments and churches both have usurped the great spir itual God-force that exists and that we have a right to. The American Indians referred to it as \"The Great Spirit,\" and most of the ancient peoples of the world recogni zed it. That is what man owes his first and only allegiance to - that great creativ e force in the univer se that gave us life and gives you freedom. PT: That reminds me of the Chief Seattle speech that was reprinted in the book that you also appeared in Th e Book Your Church Doesn't Want You To Read. He said that we all have the same God. JM: And that's exactly right. But today, in the Western world in particular, we have given ourselves - our bodies, our minds, and our money - over to politics, to government, and to churches, instead of to that Great Spirit. That makes a very big connection between church an d government. They share this same \"territory.\" And now, we are finally seeing the outcome of all this chicanery. America, one of the greatest countries ever on th e face of the Earth is now on its knees because so many of its people are broke, an d serving \"other masters.\" PT: We're also deep in debt as a country. JM: True. And no matter which side of the political spectrum it's from, every- one perceives that America is in serious, serious trouble. It is no longer something to talk about, it is something you had be tter worry about. Becau se if this country goes under and a \"New World Order\" comes in, then so goes freedom, liberty, and spiritual and intellectual enlightenment for the whole world, I believe. It's time for all people who love truth to stand up an d acknowledge that organized religion and government have failed. They are not leaders. They are misleaders. They have pur- posely misled us. And I believe that there is a higher spiritual force in this universe "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"76 that is going to deal with this state, with this government, and w ith this religion, and with us if we continue to be a part of it. PT: You have said that religion and gover nment have failed. That reminds me of two quotes from The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You To Read Pertaining to religion Robert Ingersoll said, \"Relig ion can never reform mankind because reli- gion is slavery.\" And on politics, James Madison once said, \"1 believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.\" JM: That's exactly how the ones at the top are doing it, taking our freedoms. It's the old story of the frog put into the pan of cold water, then the fire put under him slowly. The water becomes hot gradually, so that the frog doesn't notice that he's being cooked until it's too late - then it dawns on him that he's been had. PT: Otherwise, if you'd have put the heat up right away... JM: ...then he'd have felt it right away , and would never have bought into it. Americans today would never have bought into what is happening today in this country 50 years ago. People 50 years ago would turn in their graves if they could see what has happened to their beloved country. PT: So what would happen, hypothetically, then, if indeed this country did go down the tubes, if our debts were comple tely out of control and somebody had to come in with an iron fist and rule over us? JM: That's precisely what will happen, if we're not very, very careful. Another Adolf Hitler is about to be born. PT: So what can we do to avert that, if you can see that happening on the hori- zon? We want to have some hope here. JM: T believe it's very likely that the sa me kind of tyranny experienced in Nazi Germany is on the way for America. The first thing we have to do is awaken our- selves spiritually enough to understand th at we owe our thoughts, our decisions, and our lives to our higher, spiritual selves and to the spiritual power in the universe that created us - and not to our churches, reverends, preachers, not to government, not to bureaucrats, not to any human being on this Earth that puts their clothes on the same way you do. They are not in any more position of spiritual authority than any one else. That's the first thing we have to do, because right now we are not only getting poorer financially, we are very poor intellectually and spiritually. PT: So you're saying that this spiritual ignorance, this drought that we're in now - that our deepest proble ms are the result of that. JM: That's exactly what I ' m saying. The problems that we face throughout the world are spiritual problems, and not politi cal. If we were sp iritually awake and spiritually alert and alive, we would never, ever allow the kinds of things that are happening in this country and in the worl d. But one thing our \"masters\" in this country know, as all tyrants have always known, is if they can get you to sell out your morality, your ethics, and your scrupl es for money, pleasure and money, then you will no longer be a threat or be able to defend your freedom. Because you are then dependent on their alcohol, their money, their drugs, their motion pictures, entertainments, and various ot her diversions. You become so jaded in your materi- alistic lust for everything just mentioned, that you will just be quiet as long as you can have what makes you happy. Once you have your porno films, alcohol, or what- ever keeps you quiet, you will never stand up to those who provide it unless you are morally, ethically, and in every other way prepared to stand on your own, by yourself, and not be a slave to anyone. PT: Why is it that you have said that th e church is in no position to represent the highest spiritual authority? I'm wondering, is that because they can't make you realize your spiritual potential for you, but that you've got to do it yourself? JM: Yes, that is one consideration. They cannot make you a spiritual person."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"77 But I would take that a step further by saying that the organized church today, in the Western world, beginning with the Roman Catholic Church in the year 325, needs to be studied very closely. The scr iptural precedent was set by the words of Jesus, who once said, \"Can a bad tree give forth good fruit?\" I'd say that's impos- sible. So if that is true, then Protestants, who protested against Rome and set up their own organizational church, became an offspring, so to speak. And if Catholicism is the bad tree, then ac cording to a quote from their theology, Protestants are equally as bad, since a ba d tree cannot give forth good fruit. What I'm saying is that religion in the western wo rld, as we know it, is nothing more than a political movement. An entirely bad tree th at took more than 300 years to organ- ize because of scheming and in-fighting. It was organized and later directed from \"behind the scenes,\" as it still is today. Ma rtin Luther, for example, was influenced by sinister people, some who were Freemasons, for purely political reasons - to divide the power of the church. And when y ou see the church in this context, as a political movement continually playing a part in the bigger picture, then you can understand why religion and government are one and the same. PT: You quote from the Bible often. How do you view the Bible? JM: The entire story of the New Testament is an astrological story. That's inter- esting, since we have been told not to have anything to do with fortune-telling or astrology. And yet, in Genesis, Amos 5:8, and the Book of Job, Job 37:18, and Job 9:9, the Bible very clearly talks about ho w God created the heavens, or zodiac. And in Job 38:32 God asks, \"Can you direct the signs of the zodiac, or guide the con- stellation of the bear?\" This includes the proper translat ion of the word \"Mazzaroth\" into \"zodiac,\" used in Moffa tt's English Bible and The New English Bible, for example. Yet, many other versions don't bother to translate the word, but leave it as \"Mazzaroth,\" to the confusion of all readers (as in King James). And the entire scriptures are filled with the idea th at God created the 12 signs of the zodi- ac. That's why Jesus is called \"the son,\" God's SUN, who has 12 helpers, or the 12 signs of the zodiac. And in the very beginning, Genesis 1 :14, the scripture says God created the luminaries of the night â€” the stars â€” for signs. We're talking about zodialogical signs. We have a misunderstanding as to what the scriptures are say- ing, overall, and we need to get past th e misunderstandings that we have been led into by the churches. PT: Who was it in the Bible, was it Saul, who denounced witches? The Bible says he banished them from the land. Then four verses later he says, \"Bring me a witch! \" JM: Yes, King Saul. What is interesting about that is all of Christianity says that when Saul went to the witch of Endor to bring up Samuel, he went to this witch and asked her to contact the prophet Samuel, who was dead, and the witch did that. Christianity said, \"Well, that wasn't re ally Samuel, it was a demon who made him- self appear to be Samuel.\" But the fact is, if you read the account, in One Samuel, it says \"And the witch brought up Samuel and Samuel talked to...,\" and it does not say it was a demon or a spirit that was acting like Samuel, it was Samuel. PT: So there's a contradict ion there. I've heard many contradictions are also found in the four main New Testament Gospels. JM: Yes, it's there if you look. And th ere is additional information being kept from us or covered up. This is a direct quote, if you wish to quote me: I am saying that the most heinous criminals that have ever existed in this world, from what I can tell by a study of history, are here today, in America. Leading this country, as politi- cians on a state level, and es pecially on the federal level, are the most heinous crim- inals the world has ever known. These men are not politicians and leaders, they are misleaders, they are criminals. They have caused this country to be sold out to its enemies, they have bled us dry, our fina nces, they have stolen from us, and we are now in the same footsteps the Roman empire was in the early fourth century, just before the total collapse of the empire. Am erica has been in decline for the past 30 "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"78 to 40 years for sure. We are heading for a total decline and ultimate collapse. Somewhere along the line the people are going to wake up and find out their churches have not told them this. The churches have purposely kept the people sleeping, and depending on \"The Lord who is to come,\" and looking for tomorrow, and don't worry about today, don't put up an y resistance, just do whatever the gov- ernment says, and have faith in God, PT: Isn't this church mentality a repeating pattern in history? JM: Over and over. When we came out of the Dark Ages into the Age of Enlightenment, the leaders of The Enlighten ment were eventually put to death by the church. And the church always put to death anyone who would go against church or government. I believe the two greatest enemies of all free people in the world are government and religion, both. Th ey are both equal partners in tyranny and have sold us out. The government fleece s us, the church fleeces us. That's why Christians are called sheep. Because with sheep, you fleece them. And then you eat them. And sheep, of course, are the dumbest animals in the world, and any fanner will tell you that. It's true. Anyone who knows anything about animals and animal husbandly will tell you that the most incredibly stupidest animal the world has ever known is a sheep. They cannot find their way out of a paper bag, and they will fol- low anybody. PT: So what you're saying is , \"Wake up, and don't be eaten.\" JM: Right. Somewhere along the line, we've got to take back not only our country, but our spirituality. PT: So you are saying that we need to take back our spirituality and our coun- try from a powerful, shadowy movement that is slowly encroaching on us. How can we do that? JM: As I've said, we need to wake up , first, because people don't even know we've lost these things. To stay asleep, all you have to do as an American is what you've always done - nothing. All your masters have to do is what they've always done and sooner or later, their timetable for taking you over, completely destroying your freedom, your country, your spiritualit y, will have come and their goal will be accomplished. PT: So we need to wake up first. In The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read, it mentions Joan of Arc, saying after her church and country had totally discredited her, then killed her by bur ning her alive, the church turned around 500 years later and made her a saint. They did not accept her co ntribution until later. JM: This church, government, and the forces behind it are acting in the same way today and won't see their mistakes until later. They are the enemy of not only humans, but of God. I suppose we are doomed to repeat history until we get it right. PT: You spoke about forces \"behind the scenes.\" What is going on behind the scenes that we are now all up against? JM: We are in the hands of very powerful Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders that are bent on having complete power over us and the world as a whole. This goal involves the destruction of America's way of life, our way of thinking, and our free- dom. Our government is being manipulated by something higher- that is why I've said we've been \"sold out.\" Government was set up in this country to do one thing - that is, to do for the people, generally, that which they can't do for themselves. This means, more specifically, to provide for our protection as a nation, to provide for an orderly distribution of goods, and for law and order. That's all. Not coming into your bedroom, telling you what you can think, or read, or say on the radio, where you can go, what health foods or vitamins you can buy, where your kids go to school, what medications you can get, all of these things are part of a tyrannical control system that is seeping into our lives. Our government and America in gen- eral is definitely - and it could be proven in a court of law - definitely in the hands of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders that trace back to the Middle Ages - "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"79 Knighthoods, for example, The Knights Temp lars. And this is where banking, and money, comes in. When you go into a bank today and do any kind of transaction, borrowing money, using a checking account, anything, it was all started around the year 900 when banks began on an internationa l basis. This was started by an organ- ization called \"The Order of the Knights of the Temple of Solomon,\" or \"The Order of Knights Templar.\" And today, all banking is in the hands of Knights Templars Masonic Orders, Freemasons. One of the c oncordant orders of Freemasonry was called \"The Knights of the Order of the Hospital,\" and they were called \"Knights Hospitalers.\" They were the Masonic Order that founded, organizes, directs, and finances Hospitals and health care, through out the world. That is why you'll see hospitals using various Masonic symbols or emblems, if you look closely enough. So these same people, overall, control ba nking, hospitals, and ev en the entertain- ment we see. They finance and organize your media, so you will know only what they want you to know. PT: There's a lot more of that than people realize. JM: Absolutely. And you know, Merlin and the old magicians of Celtic England always used their magic wands, and these magic wands were always made out of holly wood. And that's why today we still have Holly-wood, working its \"magic\" on us â€” showing us in movies how to view thi ngs, what we should think, or just offering us a big box office diversion. Hollywood is in California, but the money and the brains are on the east coast, among maybe four or five families, that control almost all of Hollywood from New Yo rk. So we're talking about some very powerful families, that are left unnamed , who own and operate almost all of Hollywood. All major media entertainment companies have their corporate offices in New York, and that is not just coincidence. PT: Do you feel that our country has been deliberately sold out because there is kind of a conspiracy going on for a one-world government? JM: Oh, there's no doubt in my mind about that. I think even the most ignorant people today, the most ill-informed, pretty well have figured that out. I think it's pretty obvious. PT: So banks and money have a strong hand in that? JM: They don't have a hand in it, they are the culprits. The international mon- etary system, set up earlier by The Knights Templar, have in mind the total eradi- cation of freedom, and liberty, across the whole world. And if America goes down, all freedom and liberty in the world will go down with it. America is the last strong- hold on the Earth for the opportunity to be free. These Secret Societies (including The Knights Templars and Knights Hospita lers) are feverishly working behind the scenes to destroy our morals, our ethics, and our country, and to ultimately bring about a \"New World Order\" - \"Novus Ordo Seclorum,\" which is of course found on the back of a dollar bill. What's interes ting in relation to that is the pyramid on the back of the dollar. Jesus is twice re ferred in the New Testament as the \"chief cornerstone that the builders rejected.\" The apostles were referred to as corner- stones, but \"chief cornerstone\" in Greek is different from \"corners tone,\" and that is how Jesus was referred. The chief cornerstone is the triangle that sits on top of a pyramid. And in the Book of Isaiah 19:19, God says, \"I will have a temple and an altar in the midst of the land of Egypt\" (It is a \"temple and pillar\" in the King James Bible). That \"temple and altar\" is one th ing, not two, because the scripture goes on to say, \"And it shall be as a symbol and an emblem for God in the land of Egypt.\" What we're talking about, this \"it,\" is th e Great Pyramid in Egypt because the pyra- mid does sit directly in the midst of Eg ypt, on the border between upper and lower Egypt. So the pyramid, according to the Bible, Isaiah 19:19, was put there by God - it was God's will that that pyramid be there. Second, Jesus is referred to as \"the chief cornerstone,\" which means, in Greek, \"the peak of a pyramid.\" What I ' m say- ing is there's a profound depth to the sym bolism on a dollar bill, and the words. An additional phrase on it, above the pyrami d, is \"Annuit Coeptis,\" meaning \"Our "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"80 enterprise has been crowned with success. \" This project or enterprise is The New Order of the World - \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" - printed directly beneath it. This is an example of the tremendous amount of esoteric knowledge that has been kept from us. It is time that we turn off the television and the basketball, the football, the volleyball, the ping pong ball, and all the other ball games, and step back from the alcohol, all the entertainments, and look seriously at who we are and where we're going because wherever it is that we're go ing (and it doesn't look good), we're gonna get there real quick. This country is in serious trouble, but people are being told that everything is fine. PT: Well, when people are suddenly depriv ed of all of their diversions, then they'll finally get the message - we've been had. But are people that blind, not to see it beforehand? JM: Not blind, just bigoted. The old sayi ng was that \"When they came to kill Catholics I didn't bother because I wasn't a Catholic. And when they came to take away the Jews, I didn't say anything becau se 1 wasn't a Jew. And when they came to take away Protestants I wasn't a Prot estant, so by the time they came for me, there was no one else left to help, and to protect me. \" The point is, we should put aside all the bigotry, prejudice, and stupidity . In this country, we are all one people, and should act that way. We need to reali ze that we all face the same danger. Look at the leaders in America, the ones who are supposedly spokesmen for the people. In every case you will always find that th ese officials do not speak for the good of the people they represent, they ar e out there for themselves, only. PT: The lobbyists are just paying them off, and they do what they're told to do. JM: That's exactly right. So somewhere along the line, we have to come togeth- er as one people, without the corrupted \"help\" of the politicians. Or the church. Those who can see this happeni ng, and are willing to act, I believe have a cosmic companionship. Martin Luther King said it best. He said, \"In this struggle, we will be successful because we have cosmic companionship.\" I am totally convinced that that is precisely the case here. People who are standing up now, in this time, for freedom and for human dignity, do have a cosmic companionship with the Creator that gave us life. And I th ink somewhere along the line, the enemies are going to be exposed. No lie can live forever. Plato once said that, \"The price good people pay for non-involvement in public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.\" There has never been a time that we have been ruled by evil men, if not today. And they work not only out in front, and reco gnized, but also from behind the scenes, in secret. Yet, this government has a very powerful enemy that it is frightened to death of. It is not Russia, or the return of Naziism, or mi ddle eastern fanatics. The most dangerous enemy that the United States government is facing today, and it knows it, is you. You as a spiritual individual with your own rights, freedoms, and liberties to be your own self and do your own thinking. Because these things are being slowly eroded away, in hopes that we won't notice. PT: Our educational system is also bein g eroded. Much lower SAT's, kids don't know many simple geographical facts, the list goes on and on. Do you think there's an intentional \"dumbing down\" of our society taking place? JM: I sure do. The powers that be are ke eping us docile with endless diversions - movies, television, entertainments like mindless Nintendo and computer games, drugs, alcohol, they hand out condoms in some schools. And when you get kids while they're young, they develop bad lear ning habits and short attention spans. A ton of information has also surfaced co nnecting certain intelligence agencies with the drug trade into America. And who does drugs? Mostly young people. There's no doubt about an intentional dumbing down, you can't possibly get around that. And when these people grow up, as a generation, nobody will be smart enough to know what to stand up for. Just think a bout the \"Little House on the Prairie\" days, back in the 1800's and early 1900's, when the schoolrooms were one little school- room out in the middle of the prairie with all the different grades sitting together. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"81 And out of these meager be ginnings, out of these schoolhouses, came the great cap- tains and kings of industry, the great poe ts, the great mathema ticians, the greatest minds that built America and made it the strongest and most profoundly important country in the world. And today, we have the greatest schools, with air condition- ing and all the computers and, collectively, they can't find their way home. They are the most ignorant and ill-informed generation this country has ever produced. It's been said that 50 per cent of high school graduates can't find America on an unlabeled world map. Now that's frightening. PT: The NEA, the National Education Association, could be held largely responsible. It is among the four most powe rful associations in the country. It funds the education in America, controls the labor , and is said to be more of a political group (instead of a union), concerned with only power and money - not education. Dr. William Coulson helped found it about 30 years ago, but totally renounces it today because of its \"Values Modification\" agenda. This new agenda seems direct- ly linked to the growth of drug use and sexual misconduct by young people. The NEA's spending has increased more than 300 per cent since I960, but student per- formance has plummeted. The NEA controls virtually all public education in America today, but doesn't seem to care about the kids. People say it's power and money they want. An obvious tie-in to the conspiracy against America? JM: Absolutely. Our children are being sy stematically reconditioned into stu- pidity. And it's working. The kids don't seem like they want to learn. PT: They'd rather go home and watch MTV. JM: Yes, or Big Top Pee-Wee or Hulk Hogan. So what we're faced with is a very serious collapse of Western civilization. And no one wants to admit it. And consequently, like all other ancient empires have found out, there comes a time of reckoning. Our country is going the same route as the fall of Rome, and if it hap- pens, the world stands a chance of being cast into another Dark Ages. PT: But aren't there forces within our government that are really on our side? I remember a very reliable source from within our government who went by the name of \"Mr. Mike.\" You spent a day w ith him once. He detailed how there were two factions behind the scenes in our government, one working for a way to sal- vage or preserve our freedoms, and the other on working to accomplish the kind of world dominance you've detailed. JM: Yes, I'm aware that there are others who are awake and aware, and who are allying themselves with each other to do something. I do n't know who those organizations might be, but I do know from my travels around the country that many of the average people I lecture to know that what I am saying is true, on a semi-grass roots level, and they understa nd the seriousness of the problems we are facing. And I am sure that this government is absolutely frightened to death that these people will turn off the television a nd get organized. And that's the one thing they cannot afford to allow to happen. PT: Not only getting organized, but educated. JM: Yes, that's the most dangerous th ing you can do - educate people. Because when people become educated, you cannot control them, you cannot frighten them. People who are educated know their own power, and don't surrender it to others. I prefer to die someday on my feet, rather than on my knees. An idea who's time has come is individuality and freedom, and unde rstanding that both religion and gov- ernment in America are the enemies of a ll good people. All sincerely decent, good people have as their greatest enemy this government and the people behind this government who are manipulating it, and the churches, period! PT: What would you say to the people who are the real patriotic types who would tell you, \"America, love it or leave it. Why don't you just get the hell out if you think the government and churches are the enemy?\" JM: They must have said about the same thing in Rome, about the fourth cen-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"82 tury, when everything was falling apart. I' m sure there were ma ny people who said, \"Well, it's still Rome, it's still the greatest and most powerful place in the world,\" and I hear people saying that today about America. PT: Didn't Nero play the fiddle while Rome was burning? JM: Yeah, well, he might as well have pl ayed the fiddle. If he didn't, he should have. We're playing the fiddle right now - I think that was a symbolic story. I don't think Nero ever played a fiddle to start w ith. It means that while the entire Roman empire was collapsing from the weight of its own filth and corruption, the emper- or did nothing. The president of our co untry does nothing; he does nothing because he can do nothing. He is nothing more th an the slave of a slave state, the powers that be, behind his \"throne\" are the masters of this country. He is just a symbol and a figurehead who has as much power as y ou do. Actually, he has less power. And what you have to remember is that the president of America is not your president, legally. The United States federal government is a foreign corporation. According to international maritime admi ralty law, the federal govern ment of America is a for- eign corporation, in respect to the states. It is a total, separate unit of power in this country, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the separate states. It is a corporation, founded under international corporate law. A nd corporate law says that all corpo- rations must have a president and a vice president. The federal government in DC is nothing more than a business. All the wars we've ever fought were nothing more than hostile takeovers (or attempts at such) by very powerful monetary figures working behind the scenes, using this cor poration called the federal government of the United States. It's nothing but a company, and a war is nothing but a hostile takeover. PT: So can we look at this and say we ha ve just contracted out the services of this corporation to run our country? JM: That's exactly right. So when you accept a social security card or other fed- eral I.D., what you have done is you've ma de yourself a franchise. You are then a member of the federal corporation, living in a separate state, and are legally a fran- chisee of the federal system in Washingt on. DC. That's why when you pay taxes for the state of California you pay the Franchise Tax Board. When you get your bill at the end of the year for your federal taxes, write out a check and send the check to \"The U.S. Dept. of the Treasury.\" And they will send it back to you with a form let- ter, telling you that you do not owe theTre asuiy of the United States anything. You owe this money to The Federal Reserve Corp oration. It is a pr ivate corporation. Your federal taxes do not go to pay government in this country, they go to the cor- poration just mentioned. The federal tax system came into existence in 1934-35. America became the most powerful monetary nation on Earth from 1776 to 1935 without a federal income tax, without a state income tax, without any income tax. PT: Is that when the gold standard was done away with? JM: That's right. Incidentally, that's pr ecisely the year that those symbols and slogans were put there on the back of th e dollar bill. Because once they got the Federal Reserve into position, locked into position illegally, but locked into a posi- tion of power, then they could put on the dollar \"Annuit Coeptis,\" \"Our Enterprise is now a Success,\" meaning, \"We have now taken over America, and America was sound asleep and didn't even know it.\" So what I'm saying is that we have all been had. We've been had politically, and religi ously. Until such time that we wake up, we are headed toward total and complete disaster. I hate to end on such a down note, but those are the facts and we need to wake up. PT: Jordan, I'd like to end by giving you a quote from Thomas Merton, who was a Roman Catholic monk. He said, \"The most dangerous man in the world is the contemplative who is guided by nobody. He trusts his own visions. He obeys the attractions of an inner voice, but will not listen to other men. He identifies the will of God with his own heart.\" Jordan Maxwell, you are a dangerous man. JM: Thank you."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"O N R ELIGION AND P OLITICS I NTERVIEWS P ART 2 Hello, I'm Jordan Maxwell, this is a tr anscript from two separate interviews that were conducted not too long ago. Th e woman who interviewed me was Rita Dyson the man was Ralph Walker. The response to these interviews when they first aired was so overwhelming that we wanted to include them in this book. Of all the tyrannies that affect mankind, tyranny in religion is the worst. Every other species of tyranny is limited to the world we live in, but religion attempts to strive beyond the grave and seeks to pur - sue us info eternity, â€”Thomas Paine RD: Jordan, you've got to tell me about yourself. JM: Well, my grandfather was a senator, my great-grandfather was a congress- man, I have two living uncles that are federa l judges, so I grew up hearing this kind of conversation in the family, about intri gue and politics, and the behind the scenes stuff going on in world religion. At the ripe old age of 17 I decided that I wanted to find out if there was a bottom to this issu e and I began my research and study into theology and all of the arcane and occult th eologies. I was fascinated by some of the most powerful movements in the world.But the problem you run into with reli- gion and theology is that there are two kinds of facts that we have in theology, the kind you look up and the kind you make up. And so much of what we've been told and led to believe in theology and religion, especially in the western world, is noth- ing more than political propaganda. Over a nd above the political aspect of western religion, I'm also fascinated with the gene ral anthology of religion. By anthology I mean things that most people would not know about religion, things the church would rather you not know. For instance, one of my favorite topics is called astro- theology, which is the world's oldest religi on and dates back to 5,000 to 7,000 years before Christ. At that time, the worship of the heavens dominated the world. I don't believe there are too many people today in our western civilization that have real- ly looked at where their religion, their id eas, and concepts, really come from. We are all aware of how other people can be wrong in what they believe. We have a theology and other people have a mythology. According to our own narrow, per- sonal viewpoints, other people are wrong because they don't share our concepts and beliefs, and that's because they don't understand. They're wrong, but they don't understand. I am saying that we can all be wrong. There is not one human crea- ture on the earth that is so well-informed that they could possibly not be wrong about some- thing. All I'm asking my audience to do is to look at the facts of where western religion has come from, and look at the behind-the- scenes connections between government 83"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"84 and religion. Let me give you a quick ex ample between tying government and reli- gion together. When you go into most churches today you'll see that the altar is three tiers high, it's three degrees high. In most churches they have a fence and a gate and only the priest can go through the ga te up onto the altar. When the priest comes out he's dressed in a long robe and everyone stands out of respect. It's the same as in any courtroom, when they say \"all rise,\" when the judge comes out. You have the people of the congregation out in the courtroom, you have the fence and the gate, and only the attorneys can go through and speak for you. And the bench is three tiers high, the three tiers high in both the church and the courtroom repre- sent the first three degrees of freemasonry. When the judge comes out he's dressed in a long black robe, just as the priest is dressed in a long black robe, just as you will be dressed in a long robe when you graduate from a university or college. The connections are continual. The judge can s it and look down on you. and represents the law, spelled L-A-W. You need to look at where the \"law\" comes from. And then of course, the priest can look down on the audience - and to the people in the church he represents God, which is the law. RD: So you're saying that people should start looking at things with a different eye that what they're used to. People just take it for granted that this has always been, and this is the way it is. JM: Absolutely. RD: But there is an or igin for every one of these things. JM: Gerald Massey, one of the greatest Egyptologists that ever lived, wrote that \"They will find it difficult, those who have accepted the authority as truth, rather than the truth as author- ity.\" So, I'm saying that that's what's happened to us as a civilization in the West. I 'm not interested that much in the East tonight. I'm interested in our western way of life; the religion, the philoso- phies that guide our lives, the mere fact that in this country in America when you run afoul of the law, you have broken the law, just as Moses broke the law. It goes back to Judaism. And of course the sheriff has the six-pointed badge, which rep- resents the Star of David, or the six-pointed hexa- gram. All of our judicial proceedings in court are based on the old common law of England, or Britannia. It's a fascinating story once people understand that our governme nt is based on reli- gion and we didn't even know it. RD: Okay. You have such a vast amount of information that I have to try and hold you back a minute, because I want to get to other informa- tion. JM: Okay. RD: Let me ask this. How would you classi- fy yourself? Are you religious, are you spiritual, are you agnostic, what are you? JM: I am a common man, an ordinary man; in the pursuit of an extraordinary subject. I con- sider myself to be one who appreciates and will fight for truth. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"85 RD: You are a truthseeker? JM: I think that's probably the best way to term it. I am an extremely spiritual person in that I hold very high spiritual mo rals and ethics. I believe in a very pow- erful spiritual force that dominates and ove rshadows this world. Christians call it God, others may call it something else. I ha ve a very high respect for spirituality. I have no time for religion as such. Anything that is organized by man, quite cer- tainly is not touching god. I think that we have a direct connecti on with our creator, that great spiritual God-force, we don' t need another man to intervene for us. RD: Okay, let's say that someone may say \"How dare you question the Bible. How dare you speak like this, you must be a demon or something.\" How would you answer that? JM: I would say the same thing has been said of Solomon Rushdie, \"How dare you question The Koran. How dare you question Karl Marx and the Communist Manifesto. Or Mao and the Little Red Book of Mao. How dare you question authority!\" I'm saying that the man we r ead about in the New Testament, the one called Jesus, if he taught us anything, it was to question authority. Any time you give away your spirituality and your au thority, and you do it yourself, you know, no one comes and puts your hands behind your back, and forces to give up you spirituality and your individual freedom, and your right to be a human being and decide for yourself; you do that yourself. And when you do that, and you give up your sovereignty to the government, to the church, to a religion, to a book, to a con- cept, to anything, you are enslaving yourself. All I'm asking the public to do is to do a little research, see if what I ' m saying is wrong, and judge for yourself. I'm not advocating anything or running for any political office, and I'm not trying to start my own church. What I would like to see ha ppen is a spiritual revolution in this country, where people say \"just say no,\" just say no to organized religion, just say no to organized government, just say no to tyranny. I don't care where it is, or what color it is, just say no to bigotry, ignorance , ill-informed stupidity, just say no, from here on out. RD:But if... JM: The point I'm making is that you need to do your homework. You need to study and find out where things came from. RD: But what happens when they do find out? What happens to those whose whole life has been the Bible? There's so many people that are kept going every day by the Bible. What will they have to replace it? JM: Ask the Russians, in Russia today, wh at is it like when you find out you've been hood-winked, that your government wa s not the most powerful or the most wonderful government on earth and now it has totally collapsed? What do you do now? You trusted, you brought up your child ren, you wasted your entire life, and you went along to get along. And now what happens? Your entire world is col- lapsing around you, and why? Because y ou didn't do your homework, and you did- n't stand up for what was right when you could have. You went along to get along, because it was comfortable at the time, a nd now it's very uncomfortable. And I'm saying that's what we all have to do is look at the uncomfortable fact that nothing is permanently on this earth. RD: That nothing is permanently on this earth. JM: That's right. Things constantly change. The Russians should have seen it coming, and who was really controlling th em. Maybe we can learn something from what Russia has experienced. In 1922 Winston Churchill spoke to the London Press and said, \"From the days of Spartic us, Wieskhopf, Karl Marx, Trotsky, Rosa Luxemberg, and Emma Goldman, this world conspiracy has been steadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recogni zable role in the tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"86 19th century. And now at last, this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.\" And look at where thos e \"masters\" brought them -. into chaos, and now leading them into what is hoped to be The New World Order. That's why the Soviet Union collapsed. In the Wash ington Post (May 1991) Brent Scowcroft announced that \"We believe we are crea ting the beginning of a New World Order coming out of the collapse of the U.S.-Soviet antagonisms.\" What I'm saying is that it was planned, and a one world gove rnment could never function before that. RD: That's amazing. On another subject, in the book you were part of, The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read, they have here Bible models, Bible morality. And this was Thomas Jefferson that wrote this. Who was Jehovah? A being of terrific character, cruel, vindictive, capricious , and unjust. And then also, who was Abraham? An insane barbarian patriarch, who married his sister and denied his wife. Who was Jacob? Anot her patriarch who won God's favor by deceiving his father, cheatin g his uncle, and robbing hi s brother. This is Bible morality. JM: Now understand, I didn't write that. Other authors have contributed to the book. But the point I wish to make is that one does not even need to read the book. RD: Okay. JM: One can just read the Bible and put flesh on things that happened in the Bible. Think about it. RD: What I just mentioned is in the Bible? JM: Of course it is. Now let me ask you something. Are you aware that there were fifteen other major religions, this is history now... RD: Okay. JM: ...not conjecture, history. There were fifteen major theological religious movements before Christianity that taught the same identical story. Of a messiah who came to the earth, who was born in a manger, who died on a cross, who had twelve apostles, who died with a crown of thorns. Were you aware that there were fifteen major religions that had the same identical teachings of Christianity? Most people aren't. And I ' m very suspect of a si xteenth religion which is copied off of fifteen previous religions, and I am told that this one is the truth. I become very suspect. That is the way I am as a teacher and as a researcher and writer. And I tell you something else I'm very suspect of and that is the connection between gov- ernment and politics today in America. I think both should be investigated. We need to look behind the scenes of our authorities in the world - of religion, poli- tics, and money. RD: When that happens, people will have a renaissance for themselves. JM: Let us hope so. RD: And a whole new type of person can come about. JM: I think you will agree that that's what we need. Our country is in trouble, our families are in trouble, our whole huma n race is in trouble. Basically we can boil it down to three problems that we all share on this earth; religion, politics, and money. And I'm telling you that the three are not separate, they arc all one, because in the ancient world the king always repr esented not only temple power, but also heavenly power, he was the connection be tween the people and God. That is why you can not get married today without a blessing of the government, and in many cases the church. We arc told there is a division between church and state. No such division exists. If you want to start a church you must get a 501c3 permit from the government, you must get pennits, you must pay the fees, you must do all of these legal things, go through the red tape of the government, before you can set up a church. Now, in this church, with all th e government's permissi on and permits, you "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"87 can not get married in this country unless you have a license first, from the state. Then you can go to the minister and be married. And then, if your marriage does- n't work out, you don't go to God, you go to a judge, in a courtroom. I'm telling you there's something going on here betwee n religion and politics, and it's money, it's power We need to be willing to look at what's been going on in this country for over 200 years, and be open minding about it. Remember, your mind is a like a parachute, it will not work if it's not open. We can be exploited if we're not willing to open our minds and open our hearts and say , \"let's look at the facts.\" The fact is that all over the world people are being le d by religious leaders. Ayatolah Khomeini and Saddam Hussein are just two of many re ligious leaders that have been fanati- cally dangerous. And in this country we ha d put things on the backs of our cars, and yellow ribbons in our trees, to fanatically support our troops in the Middle East, when we didn't even know what they were really doing there. RD: Do you think religion and politics has something to do with this New World Order, this global unification we've heard so much about? JM: That you can bet on. RD: You do? JM: I think I could make a very good case fo r that in a court of law, if given the opportunity. Let's look at the symbolism going on here. Like the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. The Washi ngton Monument is an Egyptian obelisk, which stands for the male erection. That is its original symbolism. It connects right down to \"the waters of life\" that you see at its base, over to the oval office. The oval is the female, the Washington Monument is the male. It has to do with religion, it has to do with sex, it has to do with politic al power. And we take these instruments, and we take these symbols, and we think they are so marvelous. Do your homework and you'll find out that so much of what we consider to be holy and righteous is nothing more than sex, religion, and money. And most people pretty much know that, but no one has bothered to confront th e establishment. I hope to do that. 1 want to confront the establishment because I belie ve that the truth is an idea whose time has come. I think we've all been manipulated and exploited and it's time we looked at the real truth. RD: I think that a lot of people are wa lking around in a daze. There are so many things happening that they don't know where to turn. JM: Absolutely. RD: And I think that many of them don't feel really happy with what they are receiving in church, when they do go to church. JM: Absolutely. RD: They feel something is wrong. JM: It's because something is wrong. The things which we have been told are not true. You can prove this in any good libr ary. All one has to do is go to the library and spend all day there, reading theology, and you will find that the world has known for thousands of years that these stor ies are nothing more than stories. As a matter of fact, Rita, the Bible is called the greatest story ever told. The greatest story, not the greatest collection of facts, not the most paramount document on Earth, it's the greatest story ever told. It's a story. One must know how to read the symbols and the emblems, and the terms. RD: The symbols are in the Bible too? JM: The symbols are in the Bible everyw here. Did you know, for instance, that the Book of Revelation was not written by Christians? The Book of Revelation was around for at least 500 year s before Christianity ever came into existence. The Book of Revelation was already in circula tion, therefore no John ever wrote the Book of Revelation. His name was Ion, fro m the Ionian Sea, but when translating from Latin, when you change the letter \"I\" to \"J\" it becomes J-o-n, or Jon. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"88 However, when you translate it to Englis h, J-o-n becomes J-o-h-n, or John. So today we're told that John wrote the Book of Revelation. No such John ever wrote the Book of Revelation. It was written long before Christ was ever born. RD: This is just earthshaking. JM: Wait until the real truth comes out about religion and politics in America and you're going to see the earth shake. RD: Are you ready for the tomatoes? Are you ready for that? JM: I've already gotten those many times. RD: Okay. Now in the book The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read, you have an article entitled Astro-theology. JM: Yes. I co-edited the bo ok with Tim Leedom, but also did a chapter on astro- theology. RD: And I wanted to mention Steve Alle n, the famous entertainer and former Tonight Show host, who also wrote in this book. JM: Yes, Steve Allen is a brilliant writer and is a part of our book. He and I became friends since the book's release. RD: We opened up with that quote from Thomas Paine. You must like Thomas Paine because you also quote him in your writing. JM: Yes, I think he was an absolutely incredible man. RD: He wrote: \"The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun, in which they put a man whom they called Christ in the place of the sun and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the sun.\" Why did you select Thomas Paine? And tell me mo re about this astro-theology. JM: Because that is a classic comment a bout astro-theology. Astro-theology is the basis for all religion in the world, period. RD: Astro, what does that mean? JM: Astro-theology. Theology is the worship of a religion, and astro is the wor- ship of the heavens. From as far back in history as we can go, man has always wor- shiped the heavens. That's why we're even told in western civilization that when you die, you'll go to heaven. And of course , the interesting point that Thomas Paine was making is the same one that I continue to make - that the whole concept of the son, S-O-N, God's son, goes directly back to the concept of God's sun, S-U-N, being the risen savior. Because the sun is the risen savior. It does rise. And accord- ing to the Egyptians, God's sun, S-U-N, ha d an evil brother, he was the prince of darkness. He came out at night to rule the world when God's sun died and went away, and the world was in hands of the pr ince of darkness. His name was Set, and he came out at sun-set. The Egyptians sa id that the newborn sun that came up every morning was Horus, and they would come out at the temples of Karnak and the temples at Thebes and Heliopolis in the morning (as they still do in the Islamic faith), and greet the coming of the new sun. We do it at Easter. We have Easter SUN-rise services. RD: Horus-rising? JM: Yes. Horus-risen. That's where we get the word \"horizon.\" There are fif- teen major religions in the world before Christianity that have taught the same thing. It is a very ancient story, coming from the greatest story ever told. I ' m not saying there's not good spirituality in the Bi ble. I am saying it has been twisted and used by political powers for a political age nda to keep us ignorant, ill-informed, and unread. They keep most people dependent on the Lord to come back and help us, when in fact there is no Lord coming back at all. The keys are education, knowl- edge, and your own personal spirituality; a nd investigating what the story is really about. That's the only real salvation that we have left. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"89 RD: Okay, but what about Adam and Ev e? There's no Adam and Eve? What about Christ? JM: No, that's why the Hebrews do not take part in Christianity. The Jews do not accept Jesus as the Messiah. Many Chris tians jump to the conclusion that the Jews don't accept Jesus because they hated the Messiah. No, no such thing is true. The reason why Jews do not acce pt Christianity is really rather simple. They know the story. And they know it's just a story. It's the gentiles that don't know this. What we need to do is wake up and find out that th is is a story and what the story is telling us. RD: Now, in our last discussion you were saying that the government talks about the separation of church and state, but that is not true. JM: I don't believe that there's a separation. RD: The government is very much involved with?... JM: Religion. Yes. Actually, if you go b ack to the very beginnings of mankind there's always been this coexistence between government and religion, between church and state. And of course in all the ancient empires the king was also the mediator between god and man. So he wasn't just the king of the state, he was also the liaison between his people and God. Up until the time of the French Revolution, that was always the case, even in Europe, with the Papacy. Today, of course, we in America like to believe that we have a di vision between state and church, but it is my proposition, and my idea, that no such division exists. That the church as we know it today in western civilization, is not hing more than a tool and a counterpart to government. It is like two hands, govern ment and religion, both helping the one mind to do its work. So that's what I'm intending to do - to enlighten people to where government, ideas, concepts, and be lief systems have come from, and where theology and religion come from. I wish to show the connections behind the scenes of how we, because we're unread in the field, are being manipulated and exploited by government and religion. You asked me before what kind of reception I get. I get a very powerful positive response. When I was in New York, on ABC-New York with Bob Grant, I was supposed to do a half-hour program, but ended up doing a two-hour interview. The response was overwhelmingly positive. Many peo- ple in our country know instinctively that there's something going on in big gov- ernment, big business, big money, and big religion. And everyone seems to know that, but no one as of yet has gone into and brought out the facts surrounding reli- gion and government into our country, and the monetary connection. RD: Okay, Jordan. So, what if people begi n to see what you are saying, that the moral guidelines of our government are based on religion? Now, if you take away the religion, what will happen to the moral guidelines? We won't have any? JM:Let's make a distinction here betwee n religion and spirituality. I'm not talk- ing about spirituality. That's something we n eed to keep. I'm a highly spiritual per- son. I believe in a divine God or creator, I am totally convinced that there is a divine essence to us, so I have no problem with spirituality. RD: What makes you convinced that we do have a divine spirituality? JM: Well, I think there are far too many th ings that happen to all human beings, that we know that there's more to life than just us. I think that all of us have had many experiences, every one of us, have had experiences that prove there is some sort of spiritual dynamic to our life. I myself have had many experiences in a spir- itual way to convince me that I am not here on this earth by myself, and that there are spirits here. I believe in a God, or a creator. I don't have a problem with spiri- tuality, I have a very big problem w ith government, money, and religion. RD: Yes, it somewhat contaminates the beauty of the divine essence that is there. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"90 JM: Absolutely. No doubt about it. We ha ve the best politicians and religious leaders that money can buy, and I'm tired of that. RD: Can I ask you something? Do you be lieve in reincarnation? And what does the Bible say about that? JM: I think that you can make a good case fo r this, that there was much in the Old and New Testament to support reincarnation, but was taken out during the Middle Ages. We know that happened, we know that many scriptures were delet- ed, and some things were put in that were not in the original. So I think that the scriptures dealing with reincarnation were taken out purposely because the church felt that it would be harmful to the people , to think that they would come back, and that they come back again. Because if you keep coming back in other lifetimes, then why do you need to contribute to the church today? Why do you need to even go to church today, or even hear the priest, if you're going to come back the next time and do it over again anyway? So I think the church said no more of this, we have to take that out and let eveiyone be lieve that they have only one time through and that's it, so you have to be in subjection to religion. RD: That right there shows the government being involved with church histo- ry. JM: The history of Europe is filled with the Papacy and the Pope of Rome being involved with the kings and the prin ces of Europe. And, of course that is referred to as the \"old\" order of the worl d, the old world order. And in America we have our own religio-political foundations, and we call our ourselves a \"new\" world order, and that's even on the dollar b ill. So there's a lot of connections behind the scenes between major religion, big m oney, and government. And that is what the book is about, The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You To Read. It's a general anthology on all the things in religion th at the church doesn't want you to know about. RD: Now, as we explore this, what happens to people as they become more enlightened?. I can not think of people neve r having a church in their life. Church seems to mean so much, and to give so much more to people. I mean, how would the church be changed? Would we ever have a church again? JM: Did they have churches in Adam and Eve's day? I mean, when creation first began, with the ancient peoples in the ancient world, did they have churches? What I'm saying is there's a very big di fference between religion, which requires a church, and the clergy, and money, and organization; as opposed to spirituality within your individual self, something spiritual between yourself and your divine creator. I don't believe there is a necessity for a church, synagogue, or whatever. I think that the spirituality is between you a nd your creator. So, I don't see a need for the church. RD: I think I kind of pickup what your saying. Is that what you want - to bring back the essence and th e innocence of people? JM: Yes, absolutely. RD: And not have all of this organized religion. JM: And not have it function like entert ainment, like Entertainment Tonight. I see nothing spiritual in church television and church radio, I see nothing more than Madison Avenue's promotion of religion that in all ways, and in every way, sup- ports government. RD: That would be a major metamorphosis for people. JM: Yes. RD: If that was to ever happen. JM: I think that's going to happen. I think we are being forced, by events in the world, to wake up and begin to question our foundations and our belief systems. We "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"91 expect the Arabs to do so, we expect th e Hindus to examine their foundations and see that they need to expl ore what they believe. And it's very good for everyone else in the world to examine what they believe. Why isn't it good for us to do the same? RD: So with Freemasonry, is that where symbolism started coming about? JM: Yes, let me explain why I got into symbolism. As I mentioned earlier, my mother had an uncle who worked in the Va tican's Secretary of State's Office. Every few years he would come back and sit around for days, talking about all the intrigue that was going on behind the scenes of relig ion and politics. It was a very interest- ing conversation. And I would hear this kind of conversation where he would talk about symbols, emblems, secret societies, fraternal orders, and the wars and revo- lutions. In relation to the symbols, all of these emblems and symbols mean some- thing, but so many people are unaware. I mean, the Bible has Jesus saying that many will look with their eyes but not see, and that is certainly true. People look at symbols all day long and have no idea in the world what they mean. Symbols are very important, and if you don't think so, watch someone wearing a swastika go into a synagogue and observe the reaction that the Jews will have when they see the swastika. This is because symbols mean something. They have very powerful meanings, but most of us are ignorant as to what most of these symbols are. RD: I've often wondered about the swastika. Isn't it like a cross? JM: Actually, it's originally Hindu. The swastika of Germany was a Hindu symbol, and then it generated down until finally the Nazis picked it up, like many other nations and peoples did. The Ameri can Indians and the Buddhists also use the swastika as a sacred symbol. I was also going to make mention of the foundations of western religion. We know that western religion is based on a far older Bible, the Bible of the Old Testament. Even furt her back, if you go back into the most ancient history of the world, especially in the Middle East, you will see that the vol- cano was one of the many things that wa s worshiped. The volcano was very impor- tant because it represented life and cr eation, and it had a sexual connotation. RD: Wow. JM: That's why today in most men's rooms, and hotels, and restaurants there will always be a triangle on the door. Triangle being the pyramid, or pyra-mid, coming from pyra, meaning fire, and mid, meaning middle. The fire of sexual gen- eration is in the middle of the human body, that is why the volcano always repre- sented sex, or the coming of life and the fire of life that brings new life to the world. So the volcano was a very important sym bol to the ancient peoples of the world. The volcano, like any other impressive or fearful aspect of nature, had become an object of worship for human beings from th e time of the earliest stone age. Yet the original Yahweh, which was one of the gods of the Old Testament, seems to have begun as a volcano god. Mount Sinai, wher e Moses encountered him, was the seat of the Middianite god, and in the Middian ite's earliest homeland he was identified with the local Moon god \"Sin,\" which is where we get the name for the mountain in the Middle East, Sin-ai, or Sinai. It comes from the old Moon god Sin, after whom the mountain was named. The Bible describes the appearance of Yahweh as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, as found in Exodus 13: 21-22. The word volcano comes from the Latin volcano god Vulcan, or Vulcanus, derived from the old Cretan deity Velchanos. Now here we have the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, and the Is raelites in the desert with their representa- tion of God. In Job 38 we find that thunder, in He brew, is considered the voice of God. Thunder, in Hebrew, is called voices, or th e voice of God. In other references on Job 38 it talks about the storm. It says that the storm and clouds are in God's tent, which gather as the thunder, as the voice of Yahweh. The voice of Yahweh is roar- ing, they descend and God shoots his arrows of lightning. So we're talking about "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"92 the God of the Old Testament with his thunder and his arrows of lightning. In Hebrew,this reference states that \"God thunders wonderfully with his voice.\" So now we see that thunder and lightning are connected to the old volcano god, the god of the volcano. It is said that at Mount Sinai Jehovah performed signs, the mountain smoked and trembled all over, and many now hear d the proof that what Moses had made known in God's name was actually the word of God. The Israelites were at Mount Sinai, which is always pictured time and agai n, in many biblical texts, as a volcano. Jehovah led the sons of Israel to the mount ain named Sinai, and there he gave them his law. The mountain at Sinai where the Israelites encountered Yahweh was actu- ally a volcano. On the cover of the Jewish Torah we often see pictured the benediction sym- bol. This is the rabbinica l benediction symbol that's the blessing symbol with which the rabbis bless the congregation. The high priest of Israel often raised his hands in the priestly blessing for Yahweh, the volcano god, or Vulcan. So we see that this is a priestly blessing in the Hebrew. And today the rabbi always gives the priestly blessing for Yahweh at the syna gogue. This also explains why Mr. Spock from \"Star Trek\" gives the exact same \"p riestly blessing,\" and that's why Mr. Spock is called a Vulcan. That was the whole idea of the Vulcan, coming from Vulcanus, or the old Cretan deity which wa s later to be found in the Old Testament under the name of Yahweh. So the point I'm making is that when we find the foundations for our religious movements in America and in Europe, then we find that from those religious foun- dations we have our political movements. A nd so therefore, what we need to do is understand that our religion and our politi cs are both one in the same. If we're under the law, and have to be a nation under the law, then the law is, of course, the law from the Old Testament volcano god. So, as I said, there are two kinds of facts in theology, the kind you look up, and the kind you make up. All I ' m saying is that there's been a lot of theology that's been given to us, and we accept it blindly. But people still need to do their homework, beca use so much of what we've been given which is holy, turns out to be not so holy when you do your homework. RD: Can I ask you one more thing? What about Noah and the Curse of Canaan? JM: The Curse of Canaan (in Genesis 9:25) supposedly explains where the black man comes from, because he was cursed by God. That is a horrible misuse of scripture and I think it's too much of a subj ect to get into now. Suffice it to say that it was purposely used by people who knew better when they were using it, that it is not a curse on the black man. It has to do with the Curse on Canaan and the Canaanites, who were not black people. We can dispense with that, it was a misuse of scripture. When you get into Canaan a nd Babylon, one finds how even today, the Babylonian empire still affe cts our world. Many of our symbols and emblems come directly from Canaan and Babylon, so if there's a \"Curse on Canaan,\" we're enjoy- ing it right now. RD: So, you don't feel that this is going to take anything away from people? JM: No, I think it is a privilege to educate and help people to understand where things come from. RD: To understand what's going on? Okay, I ' m absolutely enthralled and I feel that it's such a treat that you've come to share this information with us. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"O N R ELIGION AND P OLITICS I NTERVIEWS P ART 3 The following interview with Jordan Ma xwell was conducted by Ralph Walker. RW: Let me introduce Jordan Maxwell. JM: Secret societies are a very profoun d subject and it's one that most people haven't looked at very closely. For someth ing that is so powerful and so important in our day, meaning the societies which control our country from behind the scenes, it's really important to understand how they got here and the symbols that are used. Occult symbols are like the letters of the alphabet, put them together and they tell a story. But if you can't read the symbols, you can't understand the story. A classic example I would like to bring to your audience's attention is on the dollar bill. Everyone has a one dollar bill in their pocket, but very few people have looked at the symbolism on the back. There's much talk in Washington today about a New World Order. If we look at the back of th e dollar bill, on the left-hand side, we see the magic circle. Within that magic circle is the pyramid, with the all-seeing-eye separated above the top of the pyramid. Above the eye you have Annuit Coeptis. which is Latin for our enterprise (or project) is now a success. RW: Now what was that enterprise? JM: The enterprise itself is stated beneath the pyramid, Novus Ordo Seclorum, which is in Latin, Novus is for new, Ordo is for order, and Seclorum is for the sec- ular, like your secular job, or your secular education, which means worldly, or the secular world. So the term means New Or der of the World, or The New World Order. RW: A term we hear quite frequently today. JM: Exactly. Now the interesting thing about this symbol of the New World Order is why it's pictured beneath an Egyp tian pyramid. Pyramids are in Egypt. So there's a reason why Egypt has played such a very big part in America. To the secret societies of the world, America is referred to as the \"new Egypt,\" and therefore our symbols are from Egypt. Like in Washington, DC, where we have the obelisk and the White House. The obelisk is Cleopatra's Needle. RW: Known as the Washington Monument. JM: The Washington Monument is nothing more than the Egyptian Cleopatra's Needle. As a matter of fact, if you fly ove r Washington, DC and look down, or from pictures in a library of Washington, DC, fro m the air, you will see that it's laid out in a tremendous pyramid, with the Capito l Building in the triangle at the top. The back of an Am erican dollar bill showing th e back and front (left and right, respectively) sides of the Great Seal of The United States. 93"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"94 There's the long waterway, that's the river St yx, which is out in front of Cleopatra's Needle and of course, at the end, is the magic circle, the Masonic circle. So it all has to do with ancient occult secret societies, fraternal orders, and their symbolism. RW: A question that some viewers may be wondering is why it's written in Latin and not some African language? JM: That a very good observation, becaus e it is African symbolism, but Latin language. The new order was to be made up of an elitist society, but it was to be based on the old mysticism, religion, and philosophy of Africa, but it would be a new Africa, or a \"new Egypt.\" RW: So you're saying that modern societ y goes all the way back to the Great Pyramid. JM: Oh yes, goes all the way back. As a matter of fact, if you remember, the pyramids are made out of bricks, and thos e who worked with bricks in the ancient world were called stone-masons , and today that's where we get the Masonic soci- eties, or the Masons, who work with br icks. Almost all Freemasons realize that their fraternity of freemasonry goes all the way back into the ancient world, to the first dynasties of Egypt. Much of their symbolism comes from Egypt. It's impor- tant to understand that today, when the president talks about the New World Order, and you hear this term quite often now, that you understand what he's really say- ing. America is referred to as the New World, and of course, Christopher Columbus discovered the New World. The Old World is Europe and for almost 2,000 years Europe has controlled the world. Europe has dominated the world. And Rome has dominated Europe. So for almost 2,000 years Rome, or the Roman Church, the Roman authority of Europe, through their an cient and fraternal houses, have con- trolled Europe and Europe has dominated the world. RW: Did The Crusades have anything to do with this? JM: Absolutely, that's exactly right. That's why the Steven Spielberg and George Lucas movies, with Indiana Jones a nd the Last Crusade, should be of great interest to researchers. Of course, you can 't understand the last crusade, if you don't know anything about the first one. It has to do with the lost ark, and that's why we have The Raiders of the Lost Ark, where they were searching for the Ark of the Covenant. It was purely an African sym bol, which was later brought into modern use in the Bible, where it was referred to as the Ark of the Covenant. It actually comes from Egypt, it's a much older symbol. But that's a whole different story. If you think about the power base in Europe being the old world, with those powers being behind the throne of Europe domi- nating the world, that was an order, like a Masonic order, or an order of priesthood - you know, the fraternal orders. RW: Does that reflect on history, if se veral United States Presidents belong to the Masonic Order? JM: Quite a few presidents did. In fact , many of the founders of the United States, the signers of the Constitution, were all Freemasons except for the few that were Rosicrucians, and there were a few othe rs that were of other fraternal orders. In that respect, it's interesting to do a little research in your history books on an order called Prieure de Sion, the holy house of sion. That's S-I-O-N, not Z-I-O-N. It's a very powerful secret society that's ev en in existence in the south of France today. The south of France has always been a very mystical place for occult soci- eties; for example, the Cathars, the Albigensians, and The Crusaders. Let me get back to this point about Rome dominating Europe, and Europe dominating the world. Rome, or the Roman Church today, was the power of Europe and that was the Old World Order. The order of the old world, But with the coming of America, we have a New World Order, and theref ore the elite power-base which is America is the \"new\" order. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"95 RW: Are you saying that power was passed on to America? JM: That's right, the power was passed on to America. RW: Or did they seize it and take it? JM: They actually seized it, and took it, and moved the power base from Europe to America. And therefore, the orde r that is now directing affairs behind the scenes in America is referred to those on the \"inside\" as the New Order, the New World Order, because America is the New World. And when we understand the symbolism on the dollar bill, we catch only a glimpse of the whole picture. It's such an enormous subject, but many aspects can be seen in motion pictures and in Hollywood. RW: We use this terminology \"secret societies,\" but are they really secret? JM: You see, not all of them are secret, many of them are semi-secret societies. In the 35 years that I've been interested in this subject, I've found that there's always going to be people who will come out of these societies, for whatever pur- pose, and for whatever reason, and begin to divulge some of the things that are going on behind the scenes. We sometimes hear about this from 50, to 60, to 100 years later when we find out that someone wrote a book, and then we look back and can see why things happened the way they di d. And today, as a result of what's hap- pened, our world is totally in the grips of secret societies. The Middle East is dom- inated by some very powerful secret societies and fraternal orders that are at work. That is why George Bush had the troops in the Middle East - it was to show power to other secret societies as to who is really in control of the Middle East. RW: I want to ask a question for someone who may be out there. What about the Republican and Democratic Parties? JM: I didn't write this, I'm just relati ng it to you - but George Washington men- tioned in one of his letters, actually in two of his letters, to a reverend in 1794, that there was a secret society operating in Washington at the time. He referred to it as the Democratic Society, which was later to become known as the Democratic Party. He said that this society, the Democratic Society, or the Democratic Party, was, in his own words, a subversive movement with in the republic. It had, and has, as its motive the dividing of the people from their government. To this day, you send your democratically elected leaders to Washington, not realizing that those elected lead- ers would be members of secret societies and fraternal orders that would be work- ing in concert with the secr et societies in Washington. You have to understand that Washington, DC is a very powerful spot in the world for secret activities. RW: I'll throw out a name like Ross Perot JM: Well, Ross Perot is a newcomer; I go back into Woodrow Wilson's day- his connections with occult orders. He once said something of profound impor- tance. He said, \"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of com- merce and manufacture, are afraid of some thing. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in con- demnation of it.\" That is a word for wo rd quote, from something called The New Freedom in 1913. RW: What kind of symbolism can be found today from these occult orders? JM: The first that comes to mind are the occult symbols on the dollar bill. There's an interesting point on the back of the dollar bill, on the right-hand side, with the eagle. Of course, the eagle is the old Phoenix symbol, of rising from the ashes of destruction. It comes from the old Roman symbols, which goes back even further than that. Above the eagle you'll s ee thirteen stars, ju st above the eagle's head. There are thirteen cloud-bursts arou nd the thirteen stars, there are thirteen feathers along the wings, ther e are thirteen stripes in the shield, on one side there "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"96 are thirteen arrows, on the other side there are thirteen leaves, and there are thirteen berries on the olive branch. The pyramid on th e left-hand side of the dollar has thir- teen layers. RW: And what are the berries about? JM: The most important thing is the number thirteen. Why is the number thir- teen dominating the dollar bill? It's becau se thirteen is a very powerful mystical number to secret societies. Incidentally, why did we have thirteen colonies? Why didn't we have forty-two, or ten colonies, or one hundred and twenty-seven colonies? Why did we have thirteen? RW: Now, people out there may say that thirteen is an unlucky number. JM: That's right, thirteen's an unlucky number, for you! That's the point. Thirteen is unlucky for you to use because it's a holy number. The thirteen is based on Jesus, and his twelve apostles, making thirteen. The twelve followers of Jesus were called, in the Bible, the corner stones of the New World. Jesus was twice referred to in the New Testament as the \"c hief cornerstone that the builder's reject- ed.\" The chief cornerstone! The word chief cornerstone in the Bible is a Greek word meaning the peak of a pyramid. That's what it me ans, so therefore the peak of a pyramid is a chief cornerstone. A nd according to the old cabalistic under- standing of the Bible, the pyramid at the top (the capstone) is the eye of Jesus. The eye of Jesus. Let's look at that. The eye go es back to, of course. Horns, which was the Sun in ancient Egypt. And today we have that eye on the back of the dollar bill representing Jesus, or God's \"son,\" There's a message there. RW: Do you know the person who designed that symbol (on the back of the dollar bill)? JM: I ' m not sure who designed it originally, but that symbol, on the left hand side of the back of the dollar bill, was in exis tence, just as it is today, in Bavaria, in the south of Germany, in 1774. There was an organization, a secret society, a fra- ternal order called the Illuminati, which used that exact symbol as their trademark. You can still see it in European librarie s and museums. The question is, how does it end up on an American dollar bill? Especially since it was from an old German secret society? That's the question. We th en get into some of the fraternal orders that are behind the throne in Amer ica. This is such a vast subject. RW: Which leads me to the next question. What is the impact of secret soci- eties on American politics today. JM: Secret societies are absolutely the heart, the blood, and the brains behind America today. People just don't see it. The Republican Party is one hand, the Democratic Party is another, and the brain is the secret societies behind the scenes. Very powerful and intelligent people are at work behind the scenes governing both the Democratic and Republican Parties. In point of fact, it doesn't matter who is made president, the power is always going to be in the hands of the people behind the scenes. That's why in America we have a right to elect. We love to talk about our right to elect, but we don't have the right to select- that is decided upon by those who are in power. Like today. Democr at Bill Clinton is a very well educated man, and he is a Rhodes Scholar. And if you understand where the Rhodes schol- arship comes from, it's from Cecil Rhodes of South Africa. A nd Cecil Rhodes said, before he died, that he was going to leave his millions and millions of dollars to set up a secret society that would teach young wh ite men to be able to come into power and handle the reins of a vast world gove rnment. So that was the dream of Cecil Rhodes, to be able to create a secret so ciety that could dominate the world from behind the scenes - and do it with such e xpertise that no one would ever have knowledge about it. RW: Now, it seems this could be happening. Do secret societies have any impact on the situation going on in Europe? "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"97 The White House, similar to England's White Hall, both being symbols of Freemasonic origin. JM: Absolutely. Secret societies have so mething to do with everything that's going on in the entire world. You have to know that where there's politics, there is money. And where there's money and politics, there is religion. There are powerful forces at work right now in Yugoslavia. There were books written twenty years ago talking about how the secret societies in the early 1990s were going to break up Yugoslavia (and the Balkans), and they ha d already designed how they were going to do it, and who they were going to start the war with. Twenty years ago these books were written about Yugoslavia. That's just one example, and if you're into that type of research, you can pretty mu ch tell what's coming down the line. You can already tell who's going to be doing what if you understand the story, as I said, if you can read the symbols. RW: I know you're not just predicting d oom out there. What can the American people do? Or people who want to change the situation, what can they do to expose these societies? JM: Let me say this. I am directing my work, what I do, only to a select few - to those who really care about their lives, those who really care about the country they live in, those who really care about freedom and libert y. I believe that the most important thing that one can do is educate y our mind first, because that's where real freedom is. It is in the intellect - it is spiritual and intellectual freedom. And with- out that kind of freedom, but with the th ings you don't understand, the things you don't know, and not being able to read symbols - that's where they have you, because you don't understand th e game that's being played. RW: We're in a world surrounded by fast moving symbols and images, and so no one takes the time to explore the hist ory of these and see what they mean. JM: Exactly. RW: Now a question. You are very noted lecturer - are you going to be doing future events some time in the future? JM: Yes, in fact I'm going to be doing some radio and TV programs. I did a two-hour show on ABC-New York and it was very exciting. We just did a TV pro- gram for CBS, I was on the CBS special \"Ancient Mysteries of the Bible.\" I may be doing a program for NBC,that is hopefully in the works. And also, I've just done a number of radio programs here in Los Angeles. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"98 RW: You're also going to do a book and lecture tour throughout southern California? JM: Yes. There's an enormous amount of material. A lot of people might think that this is the kind of subject that, to know about, you'd have to be in government or behind the scenes. But you'd be surprised how much material is out there, if you just know where to look. RW: Well, this is the information age and we're living in the information cap- ital of the world, Los Angeles. I'm sure th at most of the information that you've acquired you got right here in the United States. JM: Oh sure, absolutely. You may be interested to know, however, who controls the flow of our general information, for the masses, beyond what people like you and T look for. Why is our country ruled from the District of Columbia, and why do we have the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), Columbia University, and of course the Space Shuttle Columbia? And of course, the Columbia Broadcasting System on television has the symbol of the all-seeing eye, the eye on the dollar bill. Let's notice the symbols, and read them . I know I'm repeating myself, but the United States is ruled from the White H ouse, not the black house, or the brown house, but the White House. And England is , of course, ruled from the White Hall â€” which is like the Masonic hall, or the lodge hall. England's government comes from the White Hall, and America's from the White House. So there's symbols and emblems involved and they mean something. I want to point out something I con- sider very important. When the new King of England is crowned, when he is made King, listen to the words that the Arch Bishop of Canterbury will say to the new King in the initiation ceremony. He says that the King of England is taking this position as King for Jesus Christ, and ruli ng for Jehovah on God's throne. And that is why God's kingdom is represented by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is God's Kingdom. And of course Rome has a terrible dispute with that. Rome had (and has) a dispute with Engl and being the center for God's kingdom, or the United Kingdom. The Pope al ways felt that he was the Vicar of Christ and that was the basis for two world wars , that we got involved in. It is being disputed as to who and what secret society is going to be dominating the world, the Old World of Rome, or the New World of Anglo-American. This is still being decided today, and upon that note I will conclude. RW: Thank you, Jordan, for sharing so much of your important and fascinating knowledge. JM: You're very welcome. Tape Epilog: As you have seen, world politics is actually based on religion.
