At an early age he began to question the place that Man occupies in the midst of the Universe. Relentlessly he looked for ways to understand th e laws that structure these two worlds – Microcosm and Macrocosm – and the mechanisms that animate them. He is an inexhaustible searcher schooled with a scientific background. He possesses a terrific sense of humor. He generously brought to the general public the findings of his work through conferences, lectures, writings and practical lessons on the practice of Alchemy, Qabala, and Esotericism, which combined the science and philosophy of those arts. His goal and intentions remain constant: to allow the individual to become a Knower and free himself from all domination that keeps hi s spirit in bondage. He ha s always strived to offer a method of personal initiation without re lying on a master or guru. This allows all men and women who have this desire to obtain the balance between material and spiritual, keys to the inner worlds one has to tread. In this tradition of freedom, Jean DUBUIS o ffers here a method of work that is once more based on the intelligence of the spirit and on the intelligence of the heart. As in his earlier written lessons published through the former non-profit organization “The Philosophers of Nature”, Jean DUBUIS wa nted this work to be available to all those that wish to study and work in the difficu lt field of esotericism. In view of this, he relinquished his intellectual property and has allowed the publisher to disseminate this treatise by all available means. Consequently this treatise is free of rights.

My three former lessons on Alchemy, Qabala and Esotericism continue to attract the Student on the path, but always require a specific approach. The courses of Alchemy, plant (spagyric) and mi neral are often considered an elitist path considering the material demands that it requires: which include indoor and outdoor laboratories, costly glassware, products th at are sometimes difficult to obtain. These demands are compounded by the necessity of knowledge in physics and chemistry, as well as being somewhat mechanically inclined and creative. The Qabala course interests a greater number of philosophers in practical experimental work because it requires little space and no costly equipment. However, some sincere students have had some reticence in the prac tice of rituals. Other people called them lukewarm in their search but the sincerity of the pupil of good will must be understood. The course I wrote on General Esotericism 1 is concise and extremely dense. My intent was to quickly fill the void on subjects that are supposed to be known by the adept in esotericism. It emphasizes the function of symbols and offers exercises in its application. The students of that course have always asked for a follow up. That is why I have labored here to take these considerations into account, looking for a work method accessible to each. No manipulati ons in the laboratory or complex rituals are required. This is a simple work, methodi cal and necessarily rigorous, to be conducted at the rhythm of our solar system. Having undergone important personal experiences , I have been led to abandon the idea of an already drafted progressive teaching. Under th is new light, I structured this treatise in view of the sole preparation towards an e xperience of very high level, named here the Great Experience , the Contact on Eternity or the Experience of the Point . I have spontaneously experienced this contact several times. I have tried to understand its mechanism in order to reproduce it. Moreover, I have often noted that there are more people ready to live an inner contact than th ey are aware of themselves. Some people I have opened up to were able to experience th is contact and receive an unforgettable inner enrichment from it. It also seemed important to me to provide to those that have very little time for esoteric study and its applications when they are quasi “ready”. Often, the failure to recognize the frame under which one must operate deprives them of a certain interior approach. We can make an analogy, compared to the e xperience that is proposed here, with what   1 In English, “The Fundamentals of Esotericism”, published by Triad Publishing. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Beyond the certain tourist attraction of the site, we can in crease its interest when we are aware of the elements that facilitate inner contact in th is location. Several elements such as: the Equinox, the hours of influence of the planet ary energies, the place and the point of telluric and cosmic resonance on the Mount, etc. If we are informed of the process, we have all the odds of receiving the energizing in flux that is freed from this highly initiatic location, placed on the Mercury level. But if we are unaware of that data - and knowing how spontaneous experiences are not that fr equent - we would be deprived of the possibility of an already enriching experience on this level. An experience of a very high level of ener getic influx is therefore offered throughout these pages. As in my former writings, this one voluntarily aims towards the Evolution and the Becoming of the Being within Nature and the Universe. This treatise is designed for the sincere seeker. In other words to the one that unceasingly endeavors to keep his spirit awak e, to the one that strives to live in a state of openness of his heart, to the one that does not fear the work to climb the lengthy but fascinating Path of Return. It is useful to read first the entire treatise before starting its systematic study. Indeed, the Great Experience cannot be easily conducted ex cept at certain times during the year and is conditioned by some preparations. To be ready early enough in the season avoids loosing a year in its unfolding. Besides, it is not unlikely that this first exposure through reading might already sensitize the student.

It is designed to be accessible to every student. However, it will necessarily touch some subjects already abundantly covered in former courses. Each time it was possible without harm to the comprehension of the text, the detailed explanations have b een reduced so that the serious student will have to refer back to the other courses. In other instances repetitions are used when they better illustrate the point. Several quotations from the Bible are found throughout this treatise. These quotations have only been inserted because of their inst ructive power of suggestion or of awakening by resonance. The letter kills but the spirit vi vifies. In the following pages the words used to explain the structure of Man and of th e Universe will remain food for thought. We must take the words and meditate on them to better grasp the delicate notions they carry. STATE OF MIND In esotericism, as in all disciplines, a ge neral basic culture facilitates the study of new subjects, study that in its turn will enrich the base culture. When a subject appears tiresome: stop and take the time to study it thor oughly, if necessary come back to it. This process will deepen as well as broaden your esoteric knowledge. Knowledge also keeps practitioners away from involuntary imprudence. The student should be mindful that the experi ences discussed in this treaty should not be considered as recipes in a cookbook but instead should be approached as processes that honor the rules and underlying laws of the uni verse and incorporate them after personal reflection. He is invited to forge his ow n opinion through experience. He should not go forward with knowledge he has not personally verified. Step by step Knowledge frees the individual. The base study of this treatise tries to show that logic and coherence in it are consistent laws in Nature (also called the Universal Spirit). The perceptions and the experiences of Nature can appear illogical or incoherent at times due to a partial misperception of reality. This access to personal experience progressively eliminates all misguided faith and all superstition. The practice of reflection and discernment will become precious auxiliaries. A necessary quality required of the student is patience, understood as persevering without tiring, which is imperative because one can only move forward step by step. Progressing through the chapters and applying the suggested exercises will allow the students to start © Triad Publishing, 2007.

QUALITIES Qualities in this contest are necessary attri butes the student should have to progress on the path. Other qualities may be added, as the student deems necessary. - Perseverance and regularity in the study: a s hort daily work is better than long periods of work with long intervals of inactivity. - Balance of life: alternation of physical and cultural activities, healthy life - without excess or abstinence - hygiene and good humor. - Mastery of breathing. - Meditation practice: concentration and listening through a non-acting vigilance. - Openness of the heart and openness of the mi nd that contribute to the development of inner perceptions. Give the least possible attention to conflicting situations in daily life. - Finally, the inner state of peace with one’s consciousness is an indispensable quality of the adept. CONDITIONS FOR THE MEDITATION WORK Material conditions - A place to study, if possible always the same location. - An oratory installed in a small room exclusively reserved for this use (a 20 sq. ft. closet is sufficient). An oratory “spot” can be used if there are problems having the use of proper premises for this function. It could be either the corner of a room, always the same, that will be “opened” th en “closed” during each session, or a simple box, containing the indicated equipment, that will be also “opened” then “closed”. It is the state in which we set ourselves that ensures the quality of the meditation. - You must be able to darken the place. - Insulation from sound as much as possible. - A comfortable temperature. - Sufficient ventilation. - A small table preferably made of wood, or any equivalent support. - A comfortable chair or armchair. - Two candlesticks. - An hourglass. - An incense burner if desired. - A checker board, or preferably, a chessboard. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity - A mirror set vertically. Its size must allow you to see your head and chest as well allow for the placement of candlesticks of each side. - Writing material: one or several notebooks to note the contacts to make up little by little your own system of symbols. Attitude: - Purification by water is a good thing: wa sh your hands; drink a glass of water ( Mens sana in corpore sano ). - Sit down comfortably, bust vertical, hands flat on the thighs that are not touching each other, feet slightly apart. - Have a positive state of mind. - Strive to be mentally calm. - Practice emptiness of the mind: you no longer even think that you don’t think. - Concentrate on the fact that you are listening to the Inner Self through opening your brain and of your heart. - In the beginning, silence is the rule. One should be passive during the meditation: we are “meditated”, we do not meditate. Complete mental silence is the only solution to hear the little inner voice which is very weak at first. It alone can guide us on the path of Initiation. Work in the oratory: Only “Nicolas-Perenelle” 2 , the student or his partner if he/she forms with him/her the couple, enters in the oratory. Nobody else can be allowed. This couple designates the union of a man and a woman animated by the will to climb the Path. This is the reason why no third party may consult the notebooks. No animal may be allowed in the orator y. Regardless of the bond one may have with their pet, its presence remains disturbing for the Air element because the animal did not have the initiation of this tree. Some exercises that proved useful can be r ecalled here. Though not presenting a direct tie with the aim of this treatise, they nonethele ss constitute an interesting preparation for the beginner. Each time that the student enters his oratory to meditate, he can do one of these exercises. The aim of these is to thin the physical matter-spirit partition which balance is mandatory in all beings. Place vertically in front of you the “New Tree” (Figure 27 ) as a support for the meditations. Choose a gesture, a word or a sentence that you will use at closure indicating that the work is finished. Note the result of the exercise in your notebook.   2 Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, French alchemists of the 14 th -15 th century; here representing a couple in the esoteric path. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

In the beginning, do not exceed four or five s econds per phase. Cease at once if any pain or difficulty in breathing is felt. After this breathing practice begin the work or the selected exercise, CONCENTRATION ON THE CHESSBOARD You can begin with a checker board (10 s quares x 10 squares) but you can very easily draw a chessboard (8 squares x 8 squares), which is preferred. - Place the chessboard horizontally in front of you or on the floor three feet away. - Place a candle of each side so that they are distant from one another of about three to five feet. - Stare at the chessboard trying to maintain and empty mental state. - The chessboard gradually takes a grey colo r, uniform, and the squares disappear. This is not always achieved on the first trial. Redo the exercise several times for a few minutes. The white squares are the symbols of the active energy; the black ones are those of the passive energy. The uniform tint is the result of the balance of the two. The success of this exercise contributes to the rebalance of the energies in us. CONCENTRATION ON THE MIRROR It is recommended to have mastered concen tration on the chessboard or the checkers board, (uniform tint) before starting this exercise. - Follow the indications for the meditation. - Sit down approximately three feet away from the mirror. - Place a candle of each side of the mirror, avoiding if possible all reflected shiny spots in it. - Concentrate on the mirror where you see the base of your nose. - You should not have any sensation of cold. After some trial runs, the mirror becomes bl ack starting with the edges; the obscurity moves forward like a wave directed towards the center. When this is reached, the mirror is entirely dark.

The light will reappear in the cen ter then spread to the entire mirror. Then, the image in the mirror is no longer that of the operator. The first time it’s possible that nothing happens. All practice requires training. If the operator experiences a sensation of co ld, close the eyes and stop the exercise until later. The perceived impulses in the mirror, like c oncentric waves, are synchronous with the heartbeats. They can be progressively slowed down, creating a sensation of peace. What the operator sees in the mirror belongs to “the other face of the mirror”. Do not be astonished by the pallor of a lot of images, as it is their characteristic and their lunar aspect that appear. If the exercise is successful, information is transmitted to the operator. Modesty and discretion about the information received is mandatory, and usage should follow ethical rules. The mirror exercise is not self-hypnosis. It is an exercise based on symbolism. The creation of duality can occur only by reflecti on of Unity on itself. The mirror is the symbol of the first phase of Creation. This exercise brings a gradual experimental control to our inner reality. These three exercises, breathing, concentra tion on the chessboard and concentration on the mirror won't be mentioned again in this treatise. The student will practice each time he deems necessary, during the study of this treatise or independently from it. Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

All rights reserved. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity ENERGY IN NATURE In all esoteric work, and in particular as offered in my previous writings, work is done through manipulating the natural energies of th e Universe. These energies are visible or invisible, material or spiritual. It will be the same in this treatise. However its process will be deeply different. In the processes described previously, the in itiatic system strives to raise our energies, level of consciousness after level of consciousne ss, from the densest to the more subtle. It is done through the manipulations of plant or mineral products as in the Alchemy course, or through rituals like in the Qabala course. In this system, the experience is not indu ced by raising the energies but by a direct contact with the energy of the highest level, in other words directly from the highest spheres of the Universe. Depending on differe nt schools this is called: “Illumination, cosmic contact, Experience of the Point, Contact with Eternity, etc. It is illustrated by the descent of the Holy Spirit on the apostles”. Although this method seems very simple, we will only suggest to operate with due knowledge. This implies a deepened study of th e laws that governs the structures of the Universe and those of Man, from his Origin to his Becoming. In this respect, we will begin with the study of the different aspects of the energy. NAUGHT - UNITY In the beginning, there is only the Naught. On e could say the non-existence, not in the sense of the negation of what is but in the sense of what is not yet . All that will exist, all that exists, is but the result of an incomprehensible thirst to Be from the Naught. That is why we can say that we are all the children of the Naught . That point of Origin is sometimes named the Unknowable, the Original Light, but also the Chaos, as it is the bearer of all the data of the Creation as if in a permanent gestation. In fact, All that is and All that will be have no other aim than making so that this Chaos, this Naught, can become conscious of itself. The only aim of the Universe is the uni versal development of Consciousness. Consciousness can develop only through Knowledge, as a result of Experience. Experience, to be possible, implies the crea tion of a frame that will be one of time and space. It is only much later, at the end of Times that consciousness will no longer need the boundaries of space-time to be . At that stage, we will ha ve long ago accomplished the construction of all our structures and animated all of them. At this point in our evolution, Consciousness will have become sufficiently “s olid” to return and subsist by itself in Unity. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity For the Naught to become Conscious and to be ab le to act, it is forc ed to self-limit. In order for that to happen, it will extract a sphe re from itself that will imprison it in time and in space. Within this sphere, Conscious ness will be constructed element by element. All of this Construction will therefore be done by the Will to Be of the Naught and the creating power of this Will is the force through which all is Created. This power of creation exists in all things and in human beings in particular. It can be unconscious or conscious and be oriented to wards Matter or towards Spirit, depending on the advancement of self-creation that consciousness possesses. DUALITY OF THE ENERGY CREATION OF SPACE-TIME All is only energy in Nature. Matter itself is a condensation of the Energy. Energy is only the vibration of a container. Unitary Energy, the one arising from the Absolute, does not obey the same rules as do energies of dualit y. These energies of duality are the only ones on which we can act. There is no satisfactory explanation on the creation of duality. The most common image is that duality is created through a reflection of Unity on Itself. This is the basis of the symbolism used in the work with the mirror in the oratory. In the origin Unity “is”. This Unitary energy is only vibrations and cannot compare to anything we know. In Unity-Eternity, there is no space, therefore the vibration has no wavelength and there is no time, therefore the vibration has no frequencies. All that we can say of it is that this energy, this focal poi nt of infinity, of eternity, has a tremendous power of attraction on all that is in harmony with itself, including a tremendous power of attraction on itself. For creation, for duality to be possible, it requires the neutralization of this gigantic universal attraction. The neut ralization of this attraction will allow the transfer of the energy and thereby the passage to Duality. Without this neutralization, all is but a Point. If this neutralization ceased, even for a brief moment, so infinitely small may it be, all the creation would instantaneously be reintegrated in the Original Point. This is translated by the people in India sayi ng that if Brahma blinked all of the creation would instantly be destroyed. In this Unitary state, consciousness cannot self-construct since it requires limits, a frame, where it can self-experience. Only the emer gence of duality through the creation of time and space will allow this construction. Figure 1 tries to illustrate this separation. As soon as we leave Unity, space-time appears which is made up of this vibratory energy. Since all things are vibrations, through thes e appear wavelength which refers to space, and frequency which refers to time. The law that operates the vibrations of Energy is Harmony. Henceforth, Resonance and Love are aspects of Energy working on itself. It is the same on the different levels of density of matter that are but a concentration of vibrations. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity “The Higher is like the Lower”. On each leve l, the fundamental laws from the more subtle energies to the denser ones are an alogous. Without constraint the energies are balanced as in communicating vessels. In Nature any unbalance is but temporary. All, gradually, returns to equilibrium. These laws of Nature are difficult to expre ss. Our Earthly language is unable to express the highest realities of the Universe. Our capacity to think is built from a world that is not Unitary but dual. At first we will have to consider these laws rather like postulates. Only high-level contacts where consciousness of the Universe is global will allow us to access these laws through inner resonance. This w ill appear under the form of symbols, of numbers, or better through conscious change of our level of perception. DIFFERENTIATION OF THE ENERGY Figure 2 attempts to illustrate the different aspects the Unitary Energy begets. At the top, in Unity, the Primordial Energy whic h is infinite is symbolized by the circle. It contains the four Elements which are not yet manifested and symbolized by the two perpendicular lines. The fact that these horizont al and vertical lines are inside the circle means the energies that represent the four elements are not manifested. As soon as duality appears, energy takes two aspects that are represented by: - The vertical line, in the circle, symbolizi ng the denominated active energy: Niter, the Subtle, the Spirit, the spiritual energy, etc., which is a life-giving energy. - The horizontal line, in the circle, symbo lizing the denominated passive energy: Salt, the Dense, Matter, the material energy, etc., which is a structuring energy . Each of these lines, always interior to the circle, reminds us that the energy is still not manifested. For information and with some reserve, this corresponds in Qabala to the stage where the non-manifested is named Chokmah. The energy under its Passive aspect and under its Active aspect will again divide in two: - Niter , energy of active dominating quality, begets an active energy: the Fire element, and a passive energy: the Air element. Fire and Air will form the spiritual life-giving principle of all things. - Salt , energy of passive dominating quality, begets an active energy: the Water element, and a passive energy: the Earth element. Water and Earth will form the material principle of the body or, better, their structure. In the Bible, the four rivers flowing from the Garden of Eden correspond to the four energies that are not yet manifested. As for the creation of duality, it is described as being the separation of the Waters. The Waters of Above are the active energies of the life- giving spirit. The Waters of Below are the stru cturing energies of matter. The Waters of Above therefore correspond to Niter and the Waters of below to Salt. Those four aspects of energy now manife sted, named “the Four Elements”, are represented by the four triangles. If the circle is a symbol of the infinite and unlimited, the triangle is a symbol of the finite and limited, of duality and form. It is only on the © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The terms: Niter, Salt, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, borrowed from Alchemy, must not be confused with their ordinary layman’s mean ing. We will keep these terms in order to ensure we understand the proper energy qualities that they bear. These terms are already present in the cosmogony texts of the Ancient R+C. It is interesting to specify these four el ements will now combine, two by two, to form what we call the three principles, familiar to the path of Alchemists: - Sulphur, energy of the Fire-Active energy and of the Air-Passive energy, is the life- giving principle of the elements in mani fested duality. It is this energy that corresponds to what we call “the soul of things”. - Salt, energy made up of the Water-Active energy and the Earth-Passive energy is the material principle on which the life-giving energy is based in manifested duality. - Mercury, energy made of the Air-Passive energy and of the Water-Active energy, ensures the junction between the world of Sp irit and the world of Matter. In fact, the Fire-Active animates the Air-Passive. Ai r-Passive, through the Mercury principle, transmits the influence of the Fire-Active to the Water-Active. The Water-Active in turn, by rebound, animates the Earth-Passive . Mercury ensures this transmission between Spirit and Matter therefore has been named the Messenger of the Gods. The four Elements are four energies which are creative structures for Water and Earth and animator of these structures for Fire a nd Air. They are only manifested aspects from the Unitary Energy. Yet, each of these aspects of energy can still be different in its properties whether it belongs to an involutionary or an evolutionary cycle. In symbolic language, the Fire of the descent, the involutionary cycle, is not identical in its properties to the Fire of the return, the evolutionary cy cle. This is also valid for the three other elements. Let specify here that there exists a relationship between the four elements described in this text and the four fundamental forces of modern physics. The best image that we could give of these el ements is to compare them to the colors of the solar light. In a way, one can compare the white light of the sun to the Unitary energy. When we diffract this white light, with the help of a prism, the diversity of the colors obtained - those of the famous rainbow - is analogous to the diversity of the elements. It can seem strange that the generating prin ciple of finished matter is symbolized by a circle, which is the symbol of the infinite, the same as the Salt issued from Unity. One can see in this choice the fact that the Ancients applied the adage “ that which is above is like that which is below ”. In ancient texts, the salt of matter has been differentiated from its homolog the celestial Salt, under the name of: salt of the earth, issued from Earth and Water. The most predominant factor in th e choice of this symbol is probably the purifying action of the salt in the preparation of each being for his Return in Eternity, in the Infinite. One of the features of the salt of the earth, particularly made obvious in Alchemy, is that it always appears in a crystallized form. The structure of a crystal is constituted by an arrangement of elements similar to each other. In nature there are seven models of these elementary constructions. Each one resonates with a frequency of the Universal Energy, either with the harmonics, or with the sub- harmonics of this frequency. Because this © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity resonance occurs only on one frequency, the crystal of each level has a purifying power on the energy. Only the energy of resonance subsists in the crystal whereas the parasitic energies of the impurities are eliminated. In Esotericism, as in today’s science, we know that all the creation is based on the different functions of the energy. This is why we should keep in mind some ideas that are given here in order to conduct the experience that will be offered. Also, remember that: - The source of all the energies of Nature is unique, infinite, eternal, and permanent. - From the beginning of the manifestation, the Unitary Energy begets: - Time (Active) and Space (Passive) - Spirit (Active) and Matter (Passive). - All manifested matter is built only through co agulation which is a densification of the energy that happens level by level. - The properties of the energy are analogous on all the levels. - On each level of condensation, be it visible or invisible, the energy takes four aspects, the four elements, from which all things are structured with a material body and a life-giving principle. This applies throughout all the visible creation as well as the invisible one. - The separation of the Unitary Energy in four elements occurs only in the space-times of Duality - The development of consciousness can only happen through experience. - Nature, and hence every being, self-construc ts and self-creates. This is why it has been said: “At the end of times, each is but the son of his deeds”.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

THE TEN LEVELS OF DENSITES All that exists in nature results from the coagulation of the Primordial Energy in ten successive stages. This is not a concept resu lting from an arbitrary division but the result of many interior revelations confirmed by e xperience. In other traditions, this decimal classification is corroborated by a ladder of te n sets of distinct and dominating properties which are detectable in Creation. These ten levels of creation have been represented differently depending upon the teaching of the schools. Most often in this study we use the system inspired by the treatise of the Golden Chain of Homer, wh ich was handed down to us by the schools of the Fama Fraternitatis. Figure 3 reproduces the Latin cover page of this work. We can see, placed in a column, ten circles that represent the ten levels of condensation of the energy. The symbols represented correspond to an alchemical path that is somewhat impractical nowadays. Obtaining the Red Stone, which is the final stage of the material work, is a method of return into Eternity. Wh en one is able to create the Red Stone the state of Rose+Cross has been obtained. In this state, the conversation with the Inner Master becomes permanent. That Stone does not give eternal life on earth but does gives access to a sufficient life span to complete the stages of initiati on past the stage of conversation with the Inner Master. The tran smutation side of the Red Stone gives the adept the material means necessary to his spiritual work. If we examine the column of the Golden Ch ain of Homer, it should be noted that the levels are unfortunately not represented in the correct order compared to Figure 4 , the text having been coded. Only the beginning and the end are at their proper place. We have: - Starting with the top, the symbol of the Eternity represents the four unconscious elements of the origin. The 1 st circle represents chaos, confusion, and the non- manifested Quaternary. - The 2 nd circle illustrates the Fire element appearing in the Spirit of the manifested world. - The 3 rd circle contains the two active elements : Fire and Water, which are Corporeus, manifested. - The 4 th circle represents the fixing of the Spirit of the World by the passive elements: Air and Earth. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The Fire dominates the passive elements: Air and Earth. - The 7 th circle is the plant kingdom. The cross is the symbol of the Quaternary, which represents the four electrons of carbon suppor t of the plant world. That same symbol, at the top and at the bottom of the colum n, is probably linked to the question of the carbon element, in the top as diamond, in the bottom part as graphite. - The 8 th circle is the mineral kingdom where the passive elements Air and Earth dominate the active element Water. - The 9 th circle is the concentration of the Spirit of the World by a fixed fire, which is the purified Chaos. - The 10 th circle with the point inside and the cross underneath is the quintessence or perfection. The point is the symbol of th e awakened universal consciousness that transforms the four elements in quintessen ce. The cross represents the four elements awakened by the work of the human being. In other words, the universal quintessence has reached perfection: the four elemen ts governed by Self-Consciousness are now totally awakened. These clarifications can illuminate, in partic ular, the students on the path of alchemy who might come across these symbols. Yet all st udents in esotericism can also study their representation, as their value remains universal. In fact, if the Rose+Cross Alchemists of th e Middle Ages and of the Renaissance coded a certain number of texts it is because initiati on, for which few people were ready in those days, required an environment and means th at could not be made public. There are good reasons to believe that these adepts lived in little groups withdrawn in castles or in remote places. From these groups, documents have been handed down allowing the seekers a preliminary preparation. For the path of Qabala, these were Christian Knorr Von Rosenroth texts, and for the path of Alch emy the book of the Golden Chain of Homer. These works give an elementary but my stical understanding of Nature, making the beginning of the initiatic work possible. Even tually contact with the Initiatic College becomes a necessity to keep moving on the Road. For the adepts far away, books gave access to ciphers such as those written by Abbot Trithemius or Basil Valentine. In the symbolism of the Golden Chain of Ho mer, the unique column indicates that the system uses only the middle path, the path of balance. For the time being we will keep this column representation of the ten successi ve stages but will use our own system of symbols (Figure 3, right column): - 1-2-3 - symbolized by a circle, represent the Unitary levels without space-time. These first three levels do not have a real existen ce in Unity. In fact these are three different perceptions of Unity by the human consciousness of the Earth. - 3 - in the circle of the infinite is the passage from Unity to Duality. - 4 to 9 - symbolized by a triangle, represent the levels of the finished limited worlds of the invisible duality. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This is the world of visible duality, of the material physical world. Another representation of the ten levels of energy is named the tree of the Sephiroth in Qabala (Figure 4 ). In this diagram, the density also grows from 1 to 10 and these levels are distributed on three columns. The passage from Eternity to space-time (unity-duality) is not clearly defined here. The ten Sephiroth (Spheres) represented by th e circles can be designated by their name, their number, their planet, their Hebrew letter, etc. To these ten Sephiroth the lines of junction named Path, numbering 22 have been added. Throughout the ages each path has been assigned with a number, a Hebrew letter and a Tarot card. These Tarot cards symbolize the journey of the human soul and th e state of the psyche that accompany it. If this deck is to be used for meditating on th e Tarot symbols, it must never be used for divination purposes. For this specific purpose, another deck should be used. We won't use the classical Qabala tree for our work. However, we think it is useful to display this image in this present course for the students that encounter qabalistic symbols in their inner images after a contact of Eternity. INVOLUTION-EVOLUTION - In the Naught there exists a powerful “pressure to Be “. - On this unitary level the Primordial Energy is unconscious of itself. - The Unconscious can only become Conscious through Experience. - Experience is not possible in unitary energy. - Nature creates duality through energy and space-time. - The Original Human Seed, unconscious, then leaves Eternity to self-create in duality in order to become conscious of itself. Consequently, the duality of energy is necessary for manifestation. This is a general rule for both Matter and Spirit. An active ener gy manifests itself by meeting an obstacle (passive energy). For example, in inter-sidereal space, the sky is dark and the light (active energy) becomes visible only if an obstacle is on its path. The obstacle represented in this case by the atmosphere (passive energy) rev eals the blue color of the sky that was invisible until then. We insist: the words “Matter, or material” a nd “Spirit, or spiritual” are not limited in our purpose to the exclusive sense normally agreed upon. Each time that they are used in this treatise, Matter designates the structuring principle of things and Spirit refers to the life- giving principle of these things on all levels of creation. If we even slightly forget these notions, we are at risk of attributing wrong values all along this study. So that our sojourn in duality is possible wh ich is not possible for the Unitary Being, our departure for space-time will occur as a kind of initiation that will create the archetypes necessary for this state. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This entire lengthy journey is called Involution or Descent. The main reason for Consciousness to plunge in to matter is to limit the perceptions of Consciousness. The perception of the totality of the vibrations of Chaos or Eternity does not permit experience. Only in duality is expe rience possible. All matter and all things are perceived through the channel of vibrati ons. We have two kinds of perception of things in space-time: things are being per ceived either through the channel of time or through space. On Figure 5, in the visible part of the Univ erse - on level 10 - we have the V line that represents the vibrations of the time scale from 0 to ∞ . -T represents what has passed and we can access it only through memory. +T represents the future that we can access through imagination. In the scale of time we have only one instant, point P that represents the present time. The vibrations of sound and light are parts of this set. The restriction of perception is at its maximum in the visible world. It is not in the same way in the invisible ones. If we consider the parts of the invisible less and less dense, the sensorial perceptions enlarge and in particular sound and sight become a common perception. The perceptible time is widened and there is no longer a true present but an area of past and future that we can directly access. In this area, our conscious ness can live in the past and in the future. Inside this area, time no longer has a fixed dir ection. It is this possibility that allows the consultation of the Archives of Nature . In the Archives or Memories of Nature, each level retains only the elements that belong to it. For example, in 6 where the solar elem ents will be “Harmony”, the structure of the perceived image is stripped from the elements of the higher levels. If we have access to levels less dense, th ese areas enlarge considerably. We can access knowledge of nature nearly in its entirety, and can access time nearly from the beginning to the end. It is only during the contact of Et ernity that all of tim e and all of knowledge will be accessible to us. Our consciousness can achieve this contact from the Great Experience in two ways: either with the infinite of time and the infi nite of knowledge or when the experience takes the form of a Point where time and knowledge are fused together. On level 10, when the work of Descent into matter is finished, the Initiation of the Nadir produces and inverses the predominance of the functions of duality. In the descent, although Spirit and Matter coexist, the strength of the Matter-function predominates. When all the structures are forged in 10, a lthough Matter and Spirit continue to coexist, the strength of the Spirit-function predominat es. At this moment the Re-Ascent or the Return begins. It is the long journey from levels 10 to 3, and much later the return into Eternity. This is the journey called Evolution, also named “Cosmic Egg” (Figure 6 ). This lengthy journey through Involution-Evoluti on lasts millions of years and exists in each of the four realms: mineral, plant, animal and human. We have departed from Unity unconscious.

CREATION OF THE FOUR TREES IN THE HUMAN BEING When the primordial Energy, substance of th e Original Human Seed, penetrates duality, “the world was without form and void”. The creative power coming from the Will to Be of the Naught begets a first level of density and a space-time still close to Eternit y, level 3. To try to grasp what can be happening at that stage, it is possible to vi sualize that in the span of the Energy, little pulsating spheres of that Energy are coagulating. There are no solid particles in nature only the assembling of these pulsating spheres coming from the Original Energy. That Energy cannot be “awakened” simultaneous ly in its four aspects. This creation occurs from the dense to the subtle and in successive order: awakening of the Earth energy, awakening of the Water energy, aw akening of the Air energy and finally awakening of the Fire energy.

The concept of tree underlies the idea of a live structure that will be put in place precisely during the creation. THE SEVEN CRYSTALLINE SYSTEMS From the scientific point of view we know how the spherical energy particles gather to constitute spherical atoms. In turn, the atoms arrange by structuring the mineral kingdom first. This order happens in two ways: th e axes of alignment are based on 90 degrees angles (Figure 7a ) or when distances of the centers of the spheres themselves are on the points of an equilateral triangle, the angles are 60 degrees (Figure 7 b ). We will have angles of 120 degrees in diamond faces. This combination of two types of alignments, based on 90° and 60°, is at the origin of the seven manifested crystalline systems in nature. When the atoms of energy are stacked in the simplest manner, they form the cubic crystal archetype of level 3 (Figure 8 ). With all sides and angles equal, this crystal is perfect. The archetypal image of a level becomes denser and denser concrete “matter” by stages in the levels underneath it, until level 10 where the de nsity of matter is such that it makes the crystal visible. Through the progression of the descent, the arch etypal images of the crystals modify and structure to match the energy density of each level. These structures gain complexity, therefore a lesser perfection. This is due to the distance from the Original Light and because of the densification of space-time. He nce, on level 4, the archetype of the cube being too perfect for this lower density, the tetragonal crystal becomes the archetype. On level 5, according to the rule of denser and denser matter, the continuous complexity increases in structures and the triangle app ears in the crystalline network. The archetype © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity of the crystal of this level, orthorhombic, ha s two angles of 60 degrees and two angles of 120 degrees. The base of this crystal is a diamond although the vertical faces are still straight angled. On level 6 appears the archetype of monoclinic crystals that also includes angles of 60, 90 and 120 degrees. Dissimilar from the above, th e lower part is a rectangle leaving only two rectangular faces. The other two faces are parallelograms. On level 7, we have the archetype of triclinic crystal. Its crystalline network is the first to be short of straight angles, all the angles being of 60 and 120 degrees. Here, all the faces are parallelograms. On 8, the level of rhombohedral crystals, there are again no straight angles. The 6 faces of this crystal are each a diamond made of tw o reversed equilateral triangles. An analogy is to be found between level 8 and level 3 regarding the harmonious structure of their respective crystals. Both have symmetrical a nd identical facets. The harmony of the cubic crystal in 3 derives from its closeness to th e Primordial Unity, where the consciousness of the Original Human Seed is all-powerful even though its awakening has barely begun. The harmony of the rhombohedral crystal in 8 comes from the balance of the creative function of consciousness on this level. It is on level 8 that is prepared, in each of the four trees, the action that every element will trigger in the visible world of 10 . It is on this level that the threshold into matter exists. In level 8 the consciousness of the Original Human Seed is the Conception phase of the material world. Level 9 is the Planning Department and level 10 both the concrete Realization and the User. Again in 8 the Mercury principle (Figure 2 ) specifically ensures the junction between Matter and Spirit. On this level, the human consciousness has authority only on the elements and has access to the true first lock that opens the door to the invisible energies. This e xplains the symbol of the double quaternary assigned to level 8 by its opening action both during the Descent as well as during the Return. Once again, there is correspondence between the regular ity of the rhombohedral crystal and the managerial and balancing function of its level. On 9, the level immediately above the physical plane, the archetype of the crystal is hexagonal. Its angles are 120 degrees and 90 degrees. Again we find the right angle described first on level 3. It is notable that certain number of elements can crystallize in 9 and also have the ability to crystallize on level 3 , such as is the case of carbon. When carbon crystallizes in hexagonal we obtain gra phite, when it crystallizes in the cubic system we obtain a diamond which is bearer of the highest energies of the Universe, almost of Eternity. This detail must not be disregarded as it opens a way of communication between levels 3 and 9 (between the Higher and the Lower). An additional note about carbon: this element is also the base for organic chemistry since it is the fundamental component of living matter of the three other realms: plant, animal and human. Considering the energy of life, the level of an element is determined by its crystalline structure. Mixing two bodies can generate a different crystallization and as a consequence, the level changes. Pure potassi um has a cubic crystallization at the highest level 3, (Figure 8) . If we add an element the mixture will lower the level and the energy will not be as pure. For instance, potassi um carbonate or: carbon + oxygen + potassium © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This potassium carbonate (salt of tartar of the Ancients) is on the solar level. Potash: potassium + oxygen + hydrogen, crystallizes in the rhombohedral system of level 8 . Here potash descended to the Mercury level. Through mixing we can modify the level of a body, but always towards densification. The work of the alchemist, on the contrary, consists in bringing back up the energy level of the elements. Some elements, due to thei r physical properties, do not allow the direct transfer of invisible energies. The most co mmon example in alchemy is the impossibility to transfer directly the energies of antim ony to gold through mercury. In this case, the necessary transfer agent is silver. This silv er will load with the invisible energy of the antimony and in turn will transfer it at the sa me rate to the mercury, until the balance of energies is reached. In the succession of enri ching operations the alchemist must always work with the same recharged silver: fres h silver without energy would discharge the mercury. DENSIFICATION OF THE EARTH ENERGY On each level the archetype of a crystal exists. Additionally, on each level a whole mineral world is created. Their common arch etype is the crystal corresponding to the density of that level. For example, the mineral world created in 6 has for a common archetype the monoclinic crystal. These invisible worlds somewhat resemble the mineral landscape without air or water of the planets which are illustrated in certain comic strips. They are not physically perceptible but some of us encounter them in our dreams. Figure 8 illustrates the densification of energy through the mineral realm. On the left appears the type of crystal generated on each level. In the center, the separation of the two lines descended from the Origin represents the simultaneous growth of the density of matter and of space-time. On the right, the undulating curve represents the sequence of the energy resonating with the crystals. The dotted line indicates the variations of the maximums of energy. From level 3 onward, two phenomena occur simultaneously: creation of the crystalline structure of the level and increasing densifi cation of the energy. Each crystalline system has a resonance frequency with the energy. At each point of resonance (line on the tops of the curve) there is a maximum of energy. At every point of no-resonance (hollow of the curve) there is a minimum of energy, which is never completely nil. When the critical value of the energy is reached, there is a cha nge of plane and creation of a new crystalline structure. This new structure has a frequenc y of resonance weaker than the preceding one because of the increase of density. Through th is phenomenon, Nature creates the different types of crystals level by level. The constr uction of the crystalline systems results from the Salt energy. Its animation comes from the Niter energy through th e light and the life that adapted to each level. All this creation that springs above le vel 10 is imperceptible to the physical consciousness of man. It is invisible except through inner experience that always belongs to other space-times. On level 10 there is no creation of a new crystalline system strictly speaking.

These crystals, due to their resonance with the energy of th eir archetypal level, can keep the subtle energies of the upper levels where they belong imprisoned while on the dense level where we live. For example, the cubic crystals will keep the energi es of level 3, the triclinic crystals those of level 7, etc. This law is of great interest si nce it will allow us on the physical level to have energies of high levels that are mandatory for the preparatory work of our Great Experience. Among the seven crystalline systems we have in 10, the cube is the crystal that contains the highest energies, those of level 3. The sy mbol of the cubic stone is used by certain schools that apply the adage: All that is Above is like All that is Below and vice versa. The rough cubic stone is the symbol of th e beginning of the material creation. The polished stone is the symbol of the Work completed in 3 on the Path of Return. ALCHEMICAL CONVERGENCES For millions of years, under the combined eff ect of heat and telluric energy, the original crystals morphed in minerals and metals. The ores each crystallize in one of the seven crystalline systems described above, which allo ws us to determine their level. This identification is possible only from the me tallic sulphides. For instance, cinnabar, mercury sulphide crystallizes in rhombohedral, archetype of level 8 . This process has revealed the correspondence of seven metals and their levels: - Level 3: lead - Level 4: tin - Level 5: iron - Level 6: gold - Level 7: copper - Level 8: mercury - Level 9: silver That same correspondence has been accepted by the Tradition. Level 10 is traditionally linked to antimony. This is a strange ore because its natural crystallization is rhombohedral, which proceeds from level 8 . However, the ancient alchemists knowingly gave it level 10 while considering the properties demonstrated during its fusion. When we melt a crystal, the energy is freed a nd naturally returns to its original vibratory level. For example, if we are talking a bout a monoclinic crystal, upon fusion the energy returns to level 6. As long as the crystal rema ins in its natural state, its energy is kept imprisoned by the crystalline arrangement, and as long as this energy is present, the alchemists say that the product is philosophical . As soon as fusion is applied, the crystal is destroyed. This is the reason why when an or e, or a metal, is melted the alchemists say that it is “dead”. Antimony is an exception as it contradicts this la w. It has this unique property to keep the © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This is why the alchemists have said of this metal that it is “immortal”. Another important quality of antimony, during specific alchemical operations, is that the crystalline system of this ore can change. From its original level 8 , it can crystallize in the 6 other system s. It is this property of transfer of energy that can be used in the revivification of metals. THE MINERAL TREE Level 10 is visible and the last stage of the dens e creation. It is quite different from the preceding levels that are invisible because of their lesser density of energy. On level 10 , the density of matter has become necessary and sufficient to prevent consciousness from perception of the above. The energy of the Original Human Seed, at its maximum of density in 10 , has practically no more information on the space-times that it just constructed and left. This work of successive structuring prevents any “reverse motion”. This programmed unavoidable constraint pus hes forward towards the Return to space- times of lesser density. For millions of year s this Re-ascent or Return activated the structures of the mineral kingdom. This concep t which is a little difficult to grasp in this initial study will be clarified in the study of th e Tree of Man. Let us remind the Lovers of the Royal Art that only the minerals of the Return are usable in alchemy, and particularly the native metals. On Figure 9 (1 st double-column on the left), one can see darkness grow during the Descent. The force of the Matter-Function predominated in this journey. In 10, the inevitable initiation of Nadir will push toward s the Return by the predominance of the force of the Spirit-Function. The Original Huma n Seed, symbolized here by the square in the triangle pointing down, comes out of th e darkness in 10, to return through the different successive plans, to its starting point in 3. At this stage, the mineral part is activated. The Mineral Consciousness of the Original Human Seed has now acquired a necessary and sufficient experience to func tion, so that the Second Journey of the Creation will be able to start. The square ha s been selected here to symbolize the four components of the Primordial Energy whic h activation has begun. The square also symbolizes the emergence of the unpolished c ubic stone because in nature the awakening of consciousness is still very weak. In our human structures the double aspect of the mineral tree will exist Eternally, the one of the Descent and the one of the Return. This is the first phase of the work of self- creation of the Original Human Seed. It is stated in Genesis: “God formed man of the dust of the ground”. This means that the in the origin the creation of man is the work of the Earth element or of the Earth energy. In agreement with several authors we named this Tree, “Mineral Tree” or “Tree of the Mineral” because it is under the sign of the Ea rth element. In truth the name “Tree of Matter” would be more exact. When this Tree is completed, there is no longer creation of matter in the Universe, only utilization or transformation of matter. The first element created was hydrogen gas that when sufficiently cooled crystallizes in the cubic system.

There were luminous white springs where the injection of energy in Duality was necessary to the creation of matter. When there was enough hydrogen created (which is currently the most common element in inte rsidereal spaces) an identical phenomenon to molecular polymerization happened on the atomic level. As long as the Tree of Matter was involutiona ry, this phenomenon lasted and atomically complex elements continued to be formed. Th e German alchemists consider that at the maximum of Involution of this Tree, the atomic element number 144 had been reached. With the Tree of Matter passing through the Na dir, the physical laws of the Universe have been modified and even reversed. Energy has ceased transforming into more complex matter. The white holes disappeared since the energy was no longer injected in Duality. The most complex atoms began to dislocate themselves as matter was restituting its energy to the Universe. Natural radioactivity appeared after passing the Nadir. The luminous white springs were slowly being extinguished until black holes appear. These are the points of passage of the energy of Duality into Unity. The Mineral Tree is now completed. It is the base for all the structures of matter and primarily those of the plant world. It is also because of their resonance properties with the different levels of energy that in the future th e crystals of plants will similarly be able to store the energies of nature. This work will happen during the construction of the plant tree, the tree from which we also proceed.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

In a similar fashion it will continue its awakening through the creati on of the vegetable or plant kingdom by activating the energy of the Water element. To create the plant kingdom, the water elem ent bases itself on structures already established in the mineral kingdom, which exist in the seven levels of non-visible density. The initiation of Duality will allow a progre ssive Descent in the plant Tree, from 3 to 10 , from the subtlest plane to the densest one. In turn the plant kingdom will be created on each level of Duality. A plant world will exist, alive, at each stage of the creation. This is why we sometimes see the plants of the invisible levels in our dreams or in our inner contacts. For those not familiar with these contacts, th e notion of space-times different than ours, which are filled with life, invisible, and on a gigantic scale, can be somewhat of a surprise since we have not being educated to this approach. Those familiar with astronomy and of the “apparent” slow movement of celestial mechanics can already have a faint idea of a cosmic reality which is mo st often non-visible.

Of course it is not detectable through the naked eye. Then, try to mentally transpose to the scale of the infinite the perpetual dynamics of the structures of life found in the infinitely small, knowing that it will remain non-perceptible on our plane.

With each descending level there becomes a denser energy and less perfec tion. This principle, common to the four trees, is a general mechanism in the Creati on. The archetype of a level serves as a reference or as a support structure to the form created in the “matter” a level immediately underneath it. Each time it has a greater comple xity. All the manifestation starts from level 3, The Universal Spirit (the Pressure to Be of the Naught) conceives the Original Archetype of all the components of each of the Trees. PROPERTIES OF THE TREE From the creation of water, liquid mandatory for life comes on our density - the awakening of the Water element. This creation has also taken place in the seven levels of preceding densities. In our world water will cont ribute progressively to the creation of the plant kingdom. This occurs by the impregnati on of the soil where some microorganisms able to live on rocks will begin to appear . Then, very slowly, the movable earth impregnated with plant life forms. Then th e energy of the Water element continues its creation by starting to make some simple plants appear. Through acquired experience plants become increasingly complex until trees appear. Because the Water element has an active character (Figure 2 ) it allows a certain manifestation of the vital principle to be possible in the creation. In the Plant Tree a beginning of activity already translates into the progressive abandonment of the rigid structures of the crystals. Curved lines appear, notably in plant cells. This activity manifests even more in the different properties of the plants we are used to. For instance we see movement of plants under the ac tion of the wind, growth and reproduction, sensitiveness of the vegetable textures and circulation of sap. The plant kingdom creation organizes itself gradually and with symmetry. This is particularly noticeable in leaves and confirms that the plant world belongs to dua lity. The diversity of the forms we find there is bound to the subtle energies belonging to the different levels of the creative energy. The study of this aspect can lead to the perception of the Signatures of Nature. A great step in the manifestation of the creation has therefore been accomplished between the mineral kingdom, apparently static, and the plant kingdom, which is slightly animated. This progression in the awakeni ng of Universal Consciousness underlines the difference that exists in quality and role of each of these first two manifested aspects of the Primordial Energy: Earth element and Water element (Figure 2 ). The plant kingdom of level 10 is the realizati on of the archetypes previously created in the upper levels. Similarly as the crystals the plants can be reservoirs of energy of the different levels. In the descent of the Water energy, resonances in the plant archetypes will be created and are a phenomenon identical to the one illustrated with the undulating curve in Figure 8 . Some spagyric schools have been interested in determining the attributions of the levels of the plants. They worked on a limited numbe r of these considering their quantity. The method of identification can be found from the crystalline structure in the spagyric sulphur of the plant.

There is also an analogy in their rules of functioning. The phenomenon of respiration is the life-gi ving principle of each of the kingdoms. On the animal and the human level, the respir atory process is essentially based on the absorption of oxygen in the air, mandatory for life, and the expulsion of carbon dioxide. Deprived of oxygen, beings die. Deprived of oxygenation, the brain stops functioning. In the plant kingdom carbon and oxygen are n ecessary for breathing. Plants absorb carbon dioxide rejected in nature and give out oxygen under the action of the chlorophyll function that occurs only under the effect of solar light. This function is reversed at night. Most plants will absorb oxygen and reject carbon dioxide. Interdependence exists between the plant, animal and human kingdoms whose elements are fundamentally compounds of carbon. Carbon, because of its prope rties, is best adapted to the descent and rise of the energies. In the mineral kingdom there also exists a respiratory phenomenon that is particularly observable through volcanic activity. In fact, when mineral matter is created, especially from level 10, there occurs a work of evoluti on. Its most evident manifestation is in the eruption of volcanoes. Sulphur is exhaled as a rejection of mineral matter breathing under the earth’s crust. This respiratory activity is also observable from the minerals that use sulphur, such as antimony. Emanations of sulfur can be smelled quite a distance away from open-sky mines of antimony. Through the sulphides, the respiratory activity induces the evolution of metallic ores as well as the evolution of mineral matter. These ores will then return to the cubic system - level 3 - which is the state of all the native metals. Nature is thrifty in its energy and processes: the resemblance between the plant and mineral evolution is remarkable through the phenomenon of respiration and particularly in its chemical aspect. In the plant, animal and human kingdoms carbon is the support of life. This is the base element of organic chemistry and its anima tion is done by oxygen. In the mineral activity, silicon compounds make up the greatest part of earth’s crust. The mineral consciousness forms and evolves because of silicon. It is th e support of life and its animation is done by sulphur, which is the base of the mineral respiration. It is interesting to note on the atomic level, on one hand, that carbon and silicon each © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Figure 10 illustrates in A and B the external electronic layer of these elements. The sub-layers are not represented on this diagram. Figure C shows the chemical combination of A and B, or better of 2A and B, oxygen and carbon producing carbon dioxide: CO² and sulphur and silicon producing SiS². Furthermore oxyge n and silicon combine to give silicon oxide: SiO². This is called silica or quartz. We note that the chemical activity occurs solely from atoms having the same electron number on their exterior layer to end with mo lecules that all have the same number of electrons on their external layer. What is astonishing within the four kingdoms, the phenomenon of universal respiration is based on identical external electronic structures. The plant, animal and human consciousne ss all form and evolve because of carbon, which is comparable to silicon in its extern al electronic structures. Oxygen gives life to carbon and its electronic external structure is comparable to sulphur. Several experiences have lead us to think th at in all the kingdoms of life, base matter has an exterior electronic structure of four el ectrons and each among them creates a link with one of the energies of the four elements. Th ere are two sub-layers of two electrons, which are the supports of Air and Fire on one hand and Earth and Water on the other. Apparently nature used only two of the el ements having this structure: carbon in the plant, animal and human kingdoms, and silicon in the mineral kingdom. It is interesting for the alchemist to know the other elements whose external electronic layer totals four electrons that are lead, ti n, and germanium. Indeed, in the alchemical operations a substitution of one of these el ements by another is possible. This is especially true when replacing carbon with lead in the acetates Path. In these realms, the life-giving element has an external electronic structure of 6 electrons. This structure is distributed in two sub-laye rs, one with two electrons and the other with four. Selenium and tellurium also have this electronic structure but apparently nature has not used them for this animating function. Some alchemists have tried to replace sulphur with selenium, without result until now. Chemistry states that an element is stable when the external layer is made of 8 electrons distributed in two sub-layers of four electrons . At this stage, we have four electrons for the elements of the Descent and four electr ons for the elements of the Return. We add that 6 is the number of the Hexagram, symbol of the link between Matter and Spirit, and particularly between the active element of Ma tter and the active element of Spirit, or of Life. This chapter may seem a digression in favor of Alchemy students. It aims at attracting one’s attention on the universal aspect of the phenomenon of respiration and on the permanent link between the four kingdoms of which we will continue the study. Some points have been suggested in order to unde rline the coherence that presides over the construction of the Universe. However, as l ong as no personal experience of extension of consciousness has personally confirmed this l ecture, it may seem quite remote. Therefore it is illuminating to try and “feel” that all th e Manifestation of the Universe is just a gigantic Respiration of the Naught. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The breathing of the Naught corresponds to what we name the “Cosmic Day”. In the dark part of this Day (The Night of Darkness) are created: - The Mineral Tree from the manifestation of the Earth energy. - The Plant Tree from the manifestation of the Water energy. On daybreak of this Day, the perception of the Light awakens. Throughout the Day the following are created: - The Animal Tree from the manifestation of the Air energy. - The Tree of Man from the manifestation of the Fire energy. At the end of this Day, the disappearance of the worlds begins and will continue until the end of the Night Rest of that Day. This progressive disappearance of the worlds corresponds to the return of the Energy in Unity. The black holes of science stand as evidence to this as we already mentioned. THE PLANT TREE Respiration is life. It is what pushes the general evolution of each kingdom including the Original Human Seed. The descent of that which will become the Human Spirit is global. This Spirit evolves and gradually awakens its consciousness through experiences. Nature constantly adapts its structure to the genera l evolution. For example, if a plant ceases to be “useful” to the evolution of the Universal Spirit (here the Water element) that plant disappears. This phenomenon is a function of the Equilibrium Law in the Universe. It means that Nature also called Creative Unde rstanding is thrifty. It always uses the solution that requires the least amount of en ergy to solve a problem. In other words, Nature uses the “right” quantity of necessary energy for its Function. This rule is often observed in chemistry and in physics. This doe s not give us permission to disrupt Nature, even less to modify its balance. Inversely, and always according to the same Equilibrium Law, when the animal or the human cycl e progress, the Water energy can still create plants according to the necessities of Nature in these two kingdoms. These aspects of Creation must be remember ed when inner experiences occur. In case you experience an important regression in time and see some plants, it could be vegetation related to the primitive stages of the creation of our planet. This vegetation may be totally non-existent nowadays. Don’t be astonished by it but instead look for its symbolism that relates to your path and your energetic structure. As before in the Mineral Tree, The Plant Tree is completed in 10 under the pre-eminence of the Matter-Function. The initiation of the Nadir will reverse the function of the energies. The pre-eminence of the Spirit-Func tion will dominate and allow for the Return of the Water Energy whose role is now to activate the structures of the Plant Kingdom.

During the four Journeys of the Energy, the Return is completed on level 3 , on the Duality side. Looking at Figure 9 ( columns 3 and 4 from the left ), we can see that darkness grows level by level. The consciousness of the water element then extracts itself from the dense spaces. In the Mineral Tree, consciousness was symbolized by an empty square underlining the passive aspect of its structure. Here the vertical line inside the square underlines the active aspect of the structur e of the plant kingdom, although the inverted triangle still symbolizes Matter (Figure 2 ). What distinguishes the Plant kingdom from the Mineral kingdom is the acceleration of the speed of the function of Consciousness. The cycle of the Earth energy in the mineral is counted in billions of years, the Water en ergy in the Plant realm works in millions of years. The mineral cycle is imperceptible to man since its changes are well beyond the duration of a human life. On the other hand, the plant cycle has duration and a rhythm of life that we can perceive. The creation of the mineral kingdom has ther efore provided both a structure and a tool that allowed for the creation of the plant kingdom . At the end of the Return in this tree, the activation of the Earth and Water elements is complete. The Original Energy of the Human Seed has completed the first part of its work of self-creation. The two base elements of material construction are comp leted and have acquired the consciousness of their realms. The awakening of consciousne ss of the energy of th e animal kingdom, the Air element, can now begin.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

THIS TREE... THIS SNAKE. . . When the Arch druid of the Gauls said: “I have been this stone, I have been this tree, I have been this snake, and now I am the Arch druid of the Gauls”, he was trying to teach his people that human beings are part of the mineral world, of the plant world and of the animal world. This teaching of profound signi ficance has often been taken literally and thus not well understood. We have never been rock, bush or crocodile. The energies of the first, the second and the third Tree are integral part of our structure. The Global Current of Creation (wherein each of us was an element as Original Human Seed), created and animated the different stages of the Mineral World, the Plant World and the Animal World. This Universal Management from which we are issued will continue through the construction of the tree of Man or tree of Fire, the Fourth Universal Journey. To grasp fully the contents of each Journey, we should not lose sight of the diagram on Figure 2 . As soon as the Unitary Energy is diffe rentiated, on level 3, its densification begins level by level. At the time of the first Journey, the “Earth” one, the energy still descends, however it descends under its four aspects (Figure 11 ). The four components of the Primordial Energy: Earth, Water, Air, Fi re, are present during the first Journey in which only the Earth element will be awakene d. The three other elements are inactive. On the second Journey, the Water one, the first element is activated, the second is awakened and the two other, alwa ys present, are still inactive. It will be like this up to the fourth Journey, which is still unfinished. We are therefore bearers of the four aspects of the Primordial Energy that underlined the talk of the Arch druid of the Gauls.

These structure functions will prepare those of the body of man. After the initiation of Duality of the Air el ement, the Human Seed creates the animal kingdom, which “incarnates” from the 3 rd level. This incarnation is of a subtle density like the energy of this level. Thus this quality makes the work of managing the bodies relatively easy. Its functioning is very simple at this stage since creation is still close to Unity. Analogically to the two other Trees, th e Seed will create, level by level, a living animal world. Here again we must understand th at a world exists on each level of density even if it is invisible to man. Wh en a new world is created in four , the structures will be supported by the ones existing in 3 and will in turn develop. Step by step, this creation will continue until it reaches 10 . We need to emphasize the following fact: the creation of matter cannot occur in the Plant the Animal and later in the Human Kingdom. Matter, or better matter-energy, can only be created in the mineral kingdom. In the creation of the Plant Tree, the activity of the water is based solely on the existing mineral ma tter. Additionally it should be noted, on each level of the animal creation, the existing matte r-energy is used and is transformed for the purpose this kingdom. On our level, the visible animal kingdom (from the protozoan to the anthropoid) is bearer of energies coming from the invi sible worlds. There, the structures were set in place as a function of the progressive density of matte r-energy. In the progression of the Descent there is increased complexity of the bodies , which always forces new learning, and a lessening of perfection due to the distance from level 3 . Close to Unity this level 3 is bearer of ample creative information. The levels that are further away and “less informed” must adapt to the existing environmen t. They resonate to a vibratory energy to create adequate structures. The learning pattern created in the successive levels will contribute to the necessary experience acquisition for the management of the animal body. This management will be done by setting the automatic functions that ensure the mechanical-chemical reactions of the body. With the progression of complex ity of the species, the functions of consciousness become able to manage increas ingly complex systems. This physiological construction in the Tree of Air is the mandatory preparation to the future Tree of Fire, the Tree of Man, where the automatic functions of the body: breathing, circulation, digestion, etc. will be managed by the individual’s unc onscious. These functions of management will become unconscious in order to free the Self-Consciousness of Man to allow the work of self-creation he will perform. In the Animal Kingdom, these functions are managed by the Group-Spirits of the different species. We won't preoccupy ourselves with the a ssignment of the levels that are in correspondence with such animal or such other species. This is because we do not have an experimental system such as in the two preceding Trees and we are against any utilization of animal energy in our works and our inner contacts. We focused previously on the correspondence between the seven levels and the seven crystalline systems.

We strongly stress that all imbalance of the Air element can lead to serious physical trouble or serious illness. In this third Journey, the awakening of c onsciousness of the Original Human Seed has spectacular properties such as: mobility, au tonomy, communication, social organization, etc. especially within the more evolved speci es. This is because of the properties of the Air energy that already belongs to the Spirit, or the active aspect of the Unitary Energy (Figure 2 ). FUNCTION OF THE AIR ELEMENT The transparency of the “veils ” is an interesting function of the animal kingdom. It is the name given to the separations between the levels (the worlds of 9 to 3 ) that are still invisible to a large number of humanity. Examin ation of animal behavior shows that the species involved has a perception of these invisible levels. This capacity allows them to survive in nature. The animal instinct is the result of perceptions of worlds located above ours. It is not that the animals are more de veloped than the rest of the creation, but the awakening of the functions of their consciousness does not require an absolute obscurity. Connections with the worlds above level 10 facilitate their existence. According to the Law of Universal Economy, Na ture causes species to disappear or to appear as it judges useful to its Aims. This is true during both the involution and the evolution. THE GROUP-SPIRITS Although Air is part of the Active aspect of Duality, it is its passive element since the active element is Fire (Figure 2 ). The passive side of this spiritual Active element already allows for an awakening of the consciousness of the world. It is not yet an individualized consciousness, which will be the attribute of Man. It remains a consciousness of group at this stage. Currents of collective energy are th e only ones that exist in this Tree. In the Global Flow the Air element creates collecti ons of energy that are group-spirits. Each animal species is controlled, or managed, by one or several group-spirits. Each of us, as element of the Global Flow, not as an individua l, contributed to the work of these groups. Self-consciousness necessary to individual life did not yet exist. This group consciousness fosters communication among animal s of a same species when they are far from each other. This social organization is a preparation towards human societies. When an animal dies, its physical body gradually decomposes in elements that return to the mineral, and then to the plant matter. The invisible energies freed by the destroyed physical body restore the reserve of energy that represents the group-spirit. That “group- energy” will progressively ascend to prepare the future and 4 th Journey.

Some qabalistic texts say that the body of man is the microcosmic image of a macrocosmic being, Adam Kadmon. Through the Air energy this model of Adam Kadmon ha s progressively driven to the creation of animal bodies very similar to those of man. Although monkeys are morphologically close to us they are not human, nor are they “sub-human” because they do not have self- consciousness. Although the Fire element is pr esent in them, it is inanimate. When the Fire element became active, the incarnation of our ancestors, the first human primates began. The tree of Air is represented on Figure 9. Leaving the darkness, after the initiation of the Nadir, Consciousness appears under the symbol of the Salt inside the upwards-poin ting triangle, symbol of the Spirit. This reminds us that sea salt is the support of animal life and all the ocean s are the animal life reserves of the planet. It is in water, indisp ensable liquid to the birth of plant life, that animal life began. The reservoirs of the ocean have been the necessary transition between the Water and the Air elements. The descent is only figuratively represented as a plunge into darkness as a result of the densification of the Primordial Energy. An ab solute darkness or total density freezes all manifestation and totally blocks this consci ousness from expressing itself. However, we know that it is not the case. Without doubt, this Consciousness evolves under the permanent impulse of the Primordial Energy that, even on level 10, remains creative and transforming. This description of the Creation of the Universe has been compressed here by necessity; however we must stop from time to time in order to comprehend the breadth of this material and to try and grasp the astonishing energetic power of Life. This Force that propelled the first blocks of en ergy is only apparently disorganized. It generated a seed in each kingdom that after numerous transformations reached completed, in truth more than elaborate, form s. This Force is tremendous in its dynamics and in the “programming” of its trajectory. An example of this is the incredible force contained in only one nucleus of an atom. Upon the inversion of the passive Spirit-Ener gy force that directed the third Tree, the Energy will slowly ascend until it reaches its return in Unity. Since the Air element is now awakened the fourth Journey can begin. This is where man is born of the Tree of Fire. The first two Trees, especially the first one are considered as the Trees of creation of Matter. The two following Trees, especially the last one, are considered as the Trees of creation of Consciousness.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Like a river with an incalculable number of molecules of water feeding its flow, the Primordial Energy, now differentiated, carries the innumerab le spheres of the Original Human Seed that embody it. Just issued from the Origin, the Seed still ha s access to all the information of the Creation but does not have Self-Consciousness. It “is” but at this point does not know it. It will have to learn it through a Self-Creation. A c ontinuous pressure pushes it to act. In order to “take its first steps” it will have to create its structures. It can do this since as energy it is motive, transformative and especially crea tive. To become conscious of itself, it will undergo the phases of gestation, birth, growth and maturity, by activating its different components: - The Earth element, through the mineral kingdom. - The Water element, through the plant kingdom, uses the support of the precedent. - The Air element, through the animal ki ngdom, uses the support of the two preceding ones. - The Fire element, through the human kingdom, uses the support of the three preceding ones. The first three journeys, the duration of which is gigantic on the scale of our space-time, took billions of years and prepared the final vehicle of the Original Human Seed.

It is however still bound to the group-spirits and not individualized. At the time of the fourth initiation of Duality on level 3 , the four elements entering in the structure of man are automatically activated (Figure 11 ) in the body prepared for this aim. As soon as the energy of the Fire is activ ated, the prepared physical body becomes the human body. Only the Fire element, the most powerful of the four elements, begets our human nature. In other words, as soon as the 4 th component of the Primordial Energy becomes active, it produces a change from the third to the fourth kingdom that manifests the first human primates. Their individuali zation of consciousness can already begin however weak this self-consciousness is. We read in Genesis “And man was clothed with coats of skins”. Beyond the simple protective concern, this means the reality of man, his real Being, has incarnated. Similar to the preceding Trees when awakeni ng their own energy, it w ill take the tree of Man a certain passage of time for the Fire ener gy to take root in him. It also took time living in this habitat called the human body for the slow ripening of individual consciousness to develop. The former animal passivity gradually disappears due to the effect of the spiritual life-giving element Fire. The Original Human Seed, now a seedling in this fourth Tree, will be able to assume its Becoming by expanding Self-Consciousness. In each of us the first three Journeys are completed. The fourth and last Journey is in progress and for each of us there remain several stages to undergo (Figure 12 ). In traditional texts, the Spirits of Nature named “elementals” are represented as little old humans. This representation wanted to illustra te that the “life-giving spirits” of nature have the same essence as humans, that they partake in the Original Human Seed and that they are as old as the beginning of time. In this symbolism the elementals have been individualized. These Spirits of Nature are in truth only the manifesta tion of a global flow of the human seed.

The initiation of Duality, which is a prelude to the awakening of the Fire element in the Tree of Man, progressively induces th e awakening of Self-Consciousness and individualization that will develop only through experience. During his first incarnations, man is conscious of the terrestrial plan e, much like each of us today, and also has the consciousness of the levels above. He perceives them in a global manner that he cannot yet differentiate. This perception of all the levels from 10 to 3 ensures a frame of life adap ted to his first steps. In the beginning of his realm man could not survive straightaway if he were directly “parachuted” in 10 without contact with the levels above, and in particular with level 3 from which he emerges. It would be similar to abandoning a baby at birth without emotional or material support. Still bound to his Origin, our primate ancestor begins his journey close to the quasi-perfection of Nature on 3 . His mind can be educated very progr essively about the weaning from the cosmic that he must face. Propelled directly into 10 without any tie to the upper levels, the structure of man of the first ages would “break”. He could not adjust to a world too far from the simple references of the first levels that were adapted to his nascent mind. He would be crushed by the density of our level because of its space-time. It is astonishing at first that the Creative Intelligence we are part of did not design from the beginning a human structure directly adapted to the space-time of level 10 . This would disregard this Primordial Law that requi res the entire Universe to create itself from the Original Human Seed. Each individual is so lely the fruit of his own creation. In order to reach our current stage it took millions of years through multiple existences. We all had to gradually create, and adapt to the i nner and mental structures corresponding to the different levels of resonance of the Fire energy. CONDITIONS OF THE DESCENT The man who begins his journey in 3 has the same powers as the initiate of the Return. He has access to all the Knowledge of Nature and can apply its laws. The initiate of the Return is Self-Conscious whereas the beginner on the Journey is almost Self- unconscious. The powerful light of the hi gh worlds dazzles the sight of his consciousness. His perception of the physical wo rld where he is incarnated is very weak and this world appears dim. Living in 10, man of the First Days has a global perception of the entirety of space-times. Furthermore the obstacle that can constitute the veils of the different space-times does not exist at this stage. In these conditions, the individual has direct knowledge of the Signatures of Nature. In spite of his inexperience due to his weak me ntal awakening, he can feed without being poisoned and he is not attacked by feroci ous animals whose group-spirit fears him, perceiving his degree of resonance. The elem ents obey him and he is able to lead a primitive life in a protective, intuitive and automatic manner. This is why in the beginning of the Realm of Man the hominid s could live with a certain security.

The current and exoteric concept says that there is a symbolism in the forms of the products of nature. This states, particularly in the plant kingdom, that symbolism allows us to know the properties of a product. For example, walnuts the forms of which resemble the brains are good for the brain; in the same way, beans would be good for the kidneys. Even if this approach has validity, it is an intellectual concept very different from what the perception of the Signatures of Nature means to the man who has a high level of consciousness. For him, as for our ancestor of the Beginning who was very close to the Origin, his consciousness functions on several levels. Even if he isn’t self- conscious, the perception of the invisible asp ects such as the perception of auras gives him broader information than solely from the visible world. In this case it is a perception of the harmony or disharmony in relation to the state of his being versus intellectual symbolism. Under the effect of the descen t of the levels of consciousness, the Signatures of Nature are presently of no practical use to us. On the other hand, if we raise our level of consciousness or if through inner experiences we recover the perception of the invisible aspects of things, we will then recover the true Signatures that have been set in the Archives of Nature. We will be able to find what is good for us in nature, to feed or to recover, knowing how to avoid products origina lly toxic or that have become toxic. The information won't be in an intellectual form but instead in what we could call a musical pattern. On these levels what is good for us is in harmony with our being. Harmony is an important esoteric law of nature, maybe the most important one. With the descent, this direct knowledge will blur. When level 3 is no longer perceptible to the individual because he has completed in himself the corresponding structure of the Fire element, man adapts his existence accord ing to the scale of information now coming from levels 4-10 , or 10-4 . “Locked” in 4 , not having access in 3 anymore, the being is completely unaware of their situation. If thei r deductive frame of mind is inherent in their nature, their capacity of analysis is not very developed yet. Furthermore, this adaptation is very slow compared to a life span, so i ndividually there is no awareness of any loss of information. On the other hand, some individua ls can still have the contact of a level when the bulk of humanity has lost it. This di fference occurs because we did not all jump at the same time in the Cosmic Train for the Human Adventure and because the change from one level to another does not occur at the same precise hour for all the beings of creation. In turn, level 4 will become invisible to the bulk of humanity, which will base its experience inside levels 10 to 5 . Then level 5 will become invisible, action on earth occurring inside the levels joining 10 to 6 , etc. Instructed through experience, where initiative is his prerogatives, man develops his mental activity and his consciousness. Progressively he will let go of his upper “bonds” in order to acquire a self-made autonomy. Along his multiple incarnations man lose s contact with the levels he passed in the growing order of their density until he is conscious of only level 10 . This space-time in which we live is where action remains limited to the present moment for most of us. Descending level after level, the Fire en ergy becomes less subtle and is replaced by increasingly dense matter. The “descending” or “ascending” of the energy never ceases to exist, regardless of the levels, since creation is a continuous phenomenon. Going down, © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Inversely, each time th e energy increases, the intensity of light increases also and consequently the density of matter decreases. To better understand the mechanisms at work in this process, we have to know that the laws of a level are subject to those of the level immediately above. The subtle energy of a level becomes the “matter” of the level i mmediately above. For example, our thoughts, mental subtle energy emitted in 10 , create a vibration that constitutes the matter-energy of level 9 . On this level is created the quasi-totality of the thought-forms projected by each of us. When these thoughts-forms are repeated, or renewed, their “consistency” can become a hindrance or a help according to thei r nature. This is due to the interaction existing between the levels. What is “cast” rebounds and reacts by simple law of cause and effect. This phenomenon is amplified when the thoughts-forms are emitted by human groups that are united by common interest s. They constitute what we call an egregore . The egregore lives only through the energetic me ntal force projected by its members that maintain the objectives they cling to. This is mostly done unconsciously. This broadcasted energy sometimes reaches a consiste ncy such that it becomes visible to some people. When the thought-forms, regardless of their nature, cease to be renewed or revived by the group, their structures gra dually lose their consistency and end up dissolving. Depending on the duration of their lif espan, be it years or even centuries, the disintegration of thought-forms is more or le ss slow. On our individual scale, the same law comes into play for each of us when creating, renewing or dissolving our own thoughts. When our inner consciousness is able to rise to level 9 to create a thought, the thought then projected from this level is a subtle r energy that constitutes the matter-energy of level 8 . If our inner consciousness is able to raise to level 8 to create a thought, the thought then emitted from this level is an energy still more subtle that constitutes the © Triad Publishing, 2007.

When the consciousne ss of an individual perceives a level of duality, the corresponding information and the relevant applications become accessible, provided he has grasped its laws. Man has here the mastery on the energy of the degree “perceived” and, furthermore, author ity on the laws of inferior degrees since he can modify their applications from the laws of above. In world 10 , man has access to numerous laws of this space-time. Science, technology and civilization result from discoveries and appli cation of the laws of nature on this level. If man has access to an upper level, he can theref ore apply the laws of said level, partly or totally. Since these laws are naturally more powerful than those of our space-time, their result can seem spectacular to those who do not have access to them. This is why the phenomenon of “miracles” or magic is no othe r than the manifestation on earth of an event triggered in support of laws of a level higher than ours. Such are the laws of the Universe. We can no doubt regret that man sometimes tr ies to play sorcerer’s apprentice. We should understand that it is not discovering the la ws of nature that puts him in infraction but rather their wrongful application. Keep in mind that it is a prerogative of man to want to grasp the works of the Universe and to e xpand his consciousness. It is not because the use of a tool can be dangerous that we should not use it. What must be learned is to make a “correct” use of it. THE POWERS OF THE GREAT CIVILIZATIONS The powers of man in the beginning of Times ar e therefore based on the laws distinct to each level. The discovery of links of cause and effect that he could establish does not necessarily imply that he knew the explanati on of the laws based on their functioning. All the groping of a child or of adults in res earch occurs in this manner. These dynamics inherent to human nature allowed us to adapt, during the progressive loss of upper contacts in the Descent, to new data sets of ex istence. It reinforced the awareness of level 10 , experimental ground par excellence , forcing the awakening of our self-consciousness. In this slow descent of the human flow constructing its consciousness, when levels 3 , 4 and 5 are no longer perceptible the first great civilizations appear on level 6 . One example is Lemuria recorded by Tradition as having been the Golden Age of humanity. Other civilizations will appear and then disappear with the progressive loss of contact of levels 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 . The civilization of Atlantis was one of the most prominent in the descent on levels 8 and 9 . This prepared our present day material civilization based solely on level 10 . Some remains of these civilizations ha ve reached us, such as the gigantic statues of Easter Island or the advanced astronomical calendar of Stonehenge. This type of past civilization is totally di fferent from what we live today. The material progress of our civilization is based solely on the laws of matter of level 10 . These laws are uncovered by humanity whose general conscious ness is of this level. For man to act on the laws of nature he must imperatively ha ve the same level of resonance or resonance on a higher level and learn to respect its ru les. One commands nature only by abiding by its laws. In civilizations where the consciousness of the human current was awake from 10 to 6 , © Triad Publishing, 2007.

His constructions were based jointly on the physical laws of our worl d and on those of the upper levels that he was aware of through his natural contact. He had the opportunity to act by using the laws of 10 in their simple application. He could also make use on our level of the laws of level 6 . Let’s come back to this. When the creativ e imagination of man on this level emits the image of a wished object, for example the pyramid, the process is the following: the pyramid is first conceptualized in 10 , level of the physical brain of man; then it is created in 6 by the energy of the thought raised to this level, a degree of high energy. If nothing else is engaged, the pyramid remains constructe d mentally on this level. It exists in the invisible space-time of 6 . The mental faculty of certain human beings at the time of the great civilizations allowed them to then materialize the pyramid in 10 , from the energy of density 6 . This psychic power does not require the tec hnical knowledge that we see developed in this turn of the XXI century. The technical-occu lt methods that were used in these distant epochs allowed movement without the need of machines or slaves. The material realizations, such as the Pyramids or the st atues of Easter Island are essentially based on the mental energy emitted in those times by those who were able to act on level 6 . The perceptions of this level were lost with the descent of the Fire element and this know-how was lost since “temporarily” inaccessible. It is difficult for most of us to grasp the technical-occult aspect of these civilizations and as long as we won’t know how to re- establish the contact with these levels, we will not be able to put in application the laws of energy they are based on. These past civiliza tions will be those of the future during the Return because the technology of the future will be based on the rediscovered psychic powers allied to a new mastery of matter. The name of “Golden Age” was assigned to Lemuria because the access to level 6 gives a powerful power of transmutation that makes it possible, for example, to obtain gold from other elements. On the Qabala Tree (Figure 4 ) this level corresponds to the Sun and its metal, gold. However in that stage of the hum an cycle we were under the influence of the densification of the elements of matter. This is an example of a harsh civilization almost without love. Let’s not forget that the powers of man are oriented towards a construction of material domination during the Descent and that, during the Return, the reverse produces the powers of man oriented toward s a construction where Spirit dominates. On level 6 during the Return, the transmutation will no longer be of material gold. Spiritual Gold will be the transmutation of the feeli ngs of man towards Universal Love. Practical Alchemical operations to obtain the transm utation are only possible to the person in resonance with level 6 . When on 7 or lower the knowledge of the operations is useless because the authority on nature is insuffi cient. The intellectual knowledge of the operations was gradually lost or viewed as superstitions. When the majority of the human current is on a specific level, all are not straightaway capable of applying the laws of this level although the potential exists. In the times of the Descent, very few were able to practi ce the above-mentioned creations. These rare individuals had known how to act earlier than the others. They were leaders who guided and directed. The “masses” repeatedly cast in obscurantism were often subjected due to their ignorance. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

During his descent in matter, his percep tion decreases to the point where it is reduced solely to that of level 10 , which is our present condition. One is tempted to see this as a regression following the Departure of the Original Human Seed. On our level, matter became so dense that it constitutes a so rt of prison to the closed windows of our consciousness, all communication or perception with the other levels being suppressed. It is this separation that provoked psychic solitude and isolation in the human being, which will give him his free will. Cut from his roots, it is impossible for him to be consciously influenced by the information of the upper levels that have now become invisible. He will undergo alone the experi ence of freedom and responsibility. In fact, man is currently in complete resonance with that 10 th level. His structure has lost the fragility of his first incarnations where, to adap t to the progressive density, he had to keep in contact with his origins. This restriction of the total perception of the Universe, in a space-time of maximum density, makes possi ble the experiences necessary to the increased creation of his Self-consciousness and to the birth of the Individual Being in the cosmic current of the Spirit energy. Improbable as it seems, all the Work of Creation has been done so that the “test” of time is as brief as possible. Since densification is necessary for evolution at the birth of consciousness, the density of the energy has been pushed to the maximum of what was possible. It leads us to think that the density of a space-time world is bound by the limit speed of its energy. Eternity annihilates tim e and space and the speed of the energy is infinite. All is but an infinitely small point. The Work of creation consists solely in breaking the speed of the energy, which stops being infinite. As the density of the worlds increase, th e speed of the energy lowers and space-time “thickens”. On Figure 5 , we see that time accessible to the consciousness of man is reduced with the increase of density: from 3 to 4 , from 4 to 5 , from 5 to 6 , etc. When we arrive in 9, we have a narrowed space-time but nevertheless with past and future. In 10 , the density reduces perceptible time to the instantaneous present P . A heavier density would therefore make perception impossibl e for consciousness. We would be in a position inverted from Eternity, also without possibility of progress. Therefore the density of our world is the maximum density of the Universe. As in our study of the previous Trees, let’s turn to Figure 9 (the two columns on the right). The energy loses power while transfor ming into matter and we lose the contact with the last rays of the Original Light in 10 . This obscurity remains relative since an absolute obscurity blocks all attempted action. Coming from the Primordial Energy the Solar light we depend on never stops coming towards us. In 10, the inescapable initiation of the Nadir triggers the climb back towards Eternity. This powerful initiation corresponds to th e present day stage of humanity. On Figure 9 , we see in 3 the Fire element. The triangle poin ting upwards with the All Seeing Eye inside it symbolizes Self-Consciousness freed from darkness. But to this day, in each of us the situation is as on Figure 12 . Three Trees are complete. In each of those the descent in the darkness and the ascent towards the light has been completed.

At this general stage of evolution, man’ s mental creations can no longer be satisfied with the sole material aspect since the initia tion of the Nadir reversed the force of the Creative Energy and triggered the return towards Eternity.

In all the representations of the astronomical or astrological solar syst em, the North Pole is above and the South Pole is below the plane of the ecliptic. In esotericism, the Nadir is the symbol of th e point where in the Universe the darkness is deepest and where the cosmic light is weakest if not nil. In the path of evolution, the consciousness of the being in the Nadir is enclosed in a prison without windows. At this stage, all pe rception of the Upper Worlds is impossible to man without inner work. INITIATION OF THE NADIR Unless we obtained all that must be brought to consciousness from the Matter point of view in the descent of the En ergy, the return cannot be considered. This law, which effect we already observed in the three preceding Tr ees, underlines the elaboration of forms and structures in Nature, particularly in the solid state. The Fire Tree undergoes the same phenomenon. The structures elaborated in the descent corresponding to this “solid” state are those of the mind of the human being adap ting to the density of matter on each level. As long as this work is not accomplished, the initiation of the Nadir cannot be triggered. If it is difficult to say if the Initiation of Dua lity occurs brutally or progressively since on level 3 the notion of time in our conscious ness is weak or nil. By comparison, the initiation of the Nadir is a stretched out opera tion. This natural process is slow and lasts quite a number of incarnations. This proce ss in the consciousness of man cannot be compared to a classical initiation. When on 10 , the successive life experiences brought to the human consciousness all the necessary mental elements for his Return; the consciousness gets weary of the matter aspect of the visible world. Monotony and saturation arise in the miscellaneous attractions of the material world. The consciousness of this level will slowly turn away and detach itself from the materiality of things to face a beginning of spirituality. Through successive incarnations, the spiritual Fire element in consciousness will recover its dominating and animating role of the Origin. When, in each of us, the attr action to the function of this energy becomes permanent, like a magnet it irresistibly attracts and becomes the true mover of our existence. At this point the initiation of the Nadir is completed. It is possible to accelerate this process when the individual is aware that he needs to re-balance his energetic © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The shift towards the Return can then be accomplished in a few incarnations, perhaps in just one. The initiation of the Nadir will definitively open the path of Return and will also modify the resonance of our structures according to the laws of Energy. We will try to explain this universal phenomenon. REPULSION-ATTRACTION With the initiation of Duality, observed attractions and repulsions appear in the created kingdoms. For example, in electricity, we have the following rules: - Positive and negative attract each other, - Positive and positive push back on each other, - Negative and negative also push back on each other. In magnetism, we have the same rules: - North pole and south pole attract each other, - North pole and north pole push back on each other, - South pole and south pole also push back on each other. The repulsion-attraction phenomenon in all of Natu re is seldom visible. It manifests itself in the paths of Descent-Return of each of the four kingdoms where Matter-energy opposes Spirit-energy. In the Descent, Matter dominates Spirit because universal repulsion dominates universal attraction. Inve rsely, during the Return, spirit dominates matter because universal attraction dominates universal repulsion. The phenomenon of repulsion, necessary to the Descent, is one of the extraordinary applications of the laws of Nature. It is this phenomenon of repulsion that provokes, in every being, a certain separation of the c onsciousness from the general human flow. Without this repulsion there would be no possibility for consciousness to create its individualization and, hence, its progressive access to Freedom. When individualization and free will are acquire d, the repulsion-function has ceased. It is relayed by the attraction-function as in the gigantic movement of a universal pendulum. The domination of the attraction slowly prepares the shift towards the unitary state of Being that will be totally acquired after the return to level 3. In nature certain forces are not submitted to this repulsion-attraction rule. Such is gravitation, which generalized attraction works on all things, positive or negative. Although compensated in the Universe by the centrifugal forces, from the atom to the cosmos, the main task of the universal attraction is to prevent a too great and useless dispersion of the cosmos. Therefore we dedu ce that gravitation is a force belonging to Unity because the forces of repulsion of the likes due to duality do not exist. A few clarifications are needed here. Presen t day science does not yet have access to the forces of gravitation and neutralizes it only through forces that are foreign to it. For © Triad Publishing, 2007.

In another domain, the initiatic path, consider th e accomplished yogi or the “saint” in a state of levitation. In this state, the being ne utralizes gravitation because his state of consciousness gives him access to an upper level of the energies, most likely on level 6. There the function of the energy allows dir ect action on the forces of gravitation. This implies the pre-eminence of the Fire and Air energies on the Earth and Water ones in the levitating person. SYMBOLISM After this side note, let’s return to the Nadir. From a symbolic point of view, the Nadir is the esoteric midnight where the day begins its work of domination on the night. It is also at midnight, in the deepest of darkness, in matter, that the birth of the child-god took place. Of course it is in each of us that the child-god is born. From a man whose interest is primarily material, the initiation of the Nadi r will make a being ready for his return in Eternity. Individuality acquired, repulsion gives way to attraction and dispersion to unification. At this midnight some texts pl ace the reappearance of Love, which is not only symbolic but also true. After the initia tion of the Nadir, every being is again irresistibly attracted by the Absolute. Some call this Universal Love.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Some among us have recovered the perception of level 9 or beyond. Others have experienced a spontaneous or induced contact in one of the upper worlds. Many hope to experience expanded perceptions. However ev eryone on Earth will have to undergo the path of Return. In the Descent we all built our mental structures and in particular the basis of our intellect under the influence of the Matter-function, more active than the Spirit-function at this point in time. This long self-creation that lasted a few million years is marked by the transformations of the brain of the human primate into the brain of the present man, and the “I” emerged conscious of his actions. This consciousness will now educate itself to be Self-conscious and responsible during the Path of Return. When the Nadir is passed, the Matter-functi on remains but the strength of the Spirit- function now dominates pulling the current of Energy towards spiritualization. Proceeding from the Universe as an element of the Cosmic Current, each of us is an Original Human Seed and integral part of this evolutionary flow. Each of us contributes or will contribute to this new dynamic in the process. No doubt, when we are up against the difficulties of our existence, this new attraction can seem imperceptible, yet the Return of humanity has begun. It will take all the necessary and sufficient time to Return in Eternity -- several thousands of years. The human original seed has a programmed obligation to undertake the four Journeys; part of this is also the obligatory pa ssage in 10 for each amongst us. The human incarnation happens directly in 10 due to the gradual descent of the Fire energy awakening the consciousness. In the same way the extension of Self-Consciousness occurs through the continuous incarnation in 10. It is here that we have our experiences; it is here that we model our own tools. To do that, the most efficient, simplest and harmonious way is to go in the direction of the “Cosmic Wind”. We are then putting in application the laws that underline the Inte lligence of the Universe. Their progressive discovery makes “Knowers” of us who will increasingly be in charge of our itinerary. THE LAW OF ATTRACTION Participating in the evolution of the Universe, we are animated with the same principle as © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Therefore, we are inclin ed to pursue our Growth through the Return which attraction manifests as strongly as in the preceding Paths. We are therefore going to encounter some worlds of lesser density where the energy will become more subtle, and our perception will be on par with these. (Figure 5) . However, when the Nadir is passed, the nece ssity of return is not immediately felt by each of us. Even if the Matte r-Energy and the Spirit-Energy have been reversed and the repulsion-attraction phenomenon has tilted, the bei ng is not at once conscious that he is magnetized towards a new pole. For a certain tim e, some incarnations - rarely just one - he will undergo the effect of the two energi es with a progressive tendency towards the second. When the attraction of the Return b ecomes more defined he is inhabited by the urge to construct his existence in this new direction that has now become his, without the possibility of going back. Gradually becoming conscious of his new path, man will even sometimes try to hastily climb the rungs. A premature or accelerated Return, obtained through artificial means, unbalances him and de prives him of access to the languages that are the keys of power on each level. The alle gory of the Tower of Babel concerns this area close to the Nadir where a return too ra pid creates the confusion of languages. This impossibility to communicate is the very symbol of the neutralization of the Word. Having cleared the Nadir some do not appear in a hurry to move forward. We could ask why work at perfecting ourselves since we c ould not subtract ourselves from the force that propels the Universe in the direction of its Becoming. In fact, although it is possible to be lazy, in general it does not last very long. Nature is by its very essence permanently dynamic and works to ensure its own Functi on. If obstacles oppose its development, it constantly searches for the most appropriate answers to neutralize this situation. It generates strategies, always with the “proper” energy, to reach its Aim. On man’s level, that will translate into situations that are sometimes uncomfortable and even constraining. He is made to walk in the direction of wh at we already named the “Cosmic Wind” which is the direction of his own Becoming. This w ill occur in all the necessary and sufficient time. In truth, there are no challenges to make us move forward, but we undergo tests, by the law of cause and effect, because we do not move forward or because we are moving in the wrong direction. We can therefore be slowed down by an erroneous conduct because we have created obstacles for our selves consciously and often unconsciously. Once the Nadir is passed, man will confronted with the progressive spiritual awakening of his seven invisible bodies. This awakening will be easier if he contributes to it in full. THE SEVEN INVISIBLE BODIES We have seen that the innate powers of man have apparently been lost during the Descent, allowing for each among us to progr essively self-construct through our sole experience. In reality, these powers are only dor mant. It is the work of the man of the Return to reawaken them through his ow n experience, mainly through his “inner” experience. This arises from a quality of conduc t in life that is not severe; it only requires an open state of mind, generous and constructiv e. This mental disposition ensures that we are less likely to be affected by obstacles. This is what makes man a being that permanently self-creates, although this seems im perceptible in the span of one lifetime.

At this stage, though having a total perception of the Universe from level 10 to level 3 , the being is animated by the Fire energy of the sole level 3 . Then when the Fire energy becomes denser and reaches level 4 , man’s perception will be within level 10 -level 4 and he will no longer have contact with level 3 . However, the energetic body that he had constructed will remain in him. When the Fire energy will reach level 5 , man will no longer have contact with level 4 but the energetic body that he had cons tructed will remain in him, etc. In fact, the energetic body built on a level become s invisible to the level of consciousness being structured. All these energetic structures successively set up during the Descent remain in every human being. In this construction similar to Russian do lls, we find once more the phenomenon already explained in the three preceding Trees. Each le vel is the reflection, the replica, of the precedent but of a heavier density. Here again, the invisible structures of the Tree of Man are the archetypes of the visible world. We therefore have a physical body, receptacle of seven invisible bodies vibrating to gradually subtler densities. The inner structures are permanent but the st ructure of the physical body is not. When we die, our being is extracted from density 10 and automatically has access in 9 . Once the body of level 9 is “turned back on”, one then perceives the universe of the four Trees that are built there. He recovers the knowledge and the laws belonging to that level. He will function on this density only, at least in th e beginning of his Return, since the levels above remain invisible and inaccessible. When the preparation to a new incarnation starts again, it triggers in him a series of contacts on levels 8, 7 and 6 . The being then vibrates in the structure of the “invisible body” of each of these levels that are momentarily re- animated. We must understand that to functi on in a space-time is only possible from one of the seven corresponding bodies. The stage of consolidation and “comforting” occurring in 8 , 7 and 6 will facilitate the new incarnation. The being will have recharged his batteries for his new incarnation in this way. To again access the space-time of level 10 , he will need another vehicle of this density, a physical body, a new home for his seven subtler bodies. BALANCE OF THE ENERGIES Only through his work of construction with spiritual dominance will man go back up level after level. He will only succeed if he concurrently works at re-establishing the circulation of his own energies. The action of walking against the flow of the “Cosmic Wind”, sometimes voluntary but most often involuntary creates imbalances. Like the visually impaired and the hearing-impaired, we move forward hesitantly in search of a switch. True obstacles are met on our individua l path, which contradictory consequences summarize in essentially energetic disruptions. How do we re-establish the balance? And which way do we begin? In the same way as we operate when we find ourselves in unknown territories. We observe the environment, we measure the data available, we study th e behavior of our partners and we listen internally through reflection in order to make decisions, etc. We have already tested this behavior many times during the Descent. But at our stage it is required to develop two qualities that will be precious and indispen sable during our Ascent: discernment pushed © Triad Publishing, 2007.

These two elements of support contribute to the intelligen ce of the spirit and to the intelligence of the heart. These are true keys of Contact, for lack of a “Master Key”. Progressing only through a series of balances and imbalances because we belong to the world of duality, we somewhat damaged our inner structure, as we damage our organism during an existence. Even though we are of good will, it frequently happens that we make clumsy use of our vehicle, our body, during our apprenticeship. Since the four Trees, the base of our present structures are intertwined, by living we create disruptions that are reverberated similar to a series of waves through all of our being. Non-harmonic vibrations have been installed and continue to install on the level of our mineral, plant, animal and human structure, and this goi ng up through all of our seven subtle bodies. This must always be translated in the four terms: energy of the Earth element, energy of the Water element, energy of the Air and energy of the Fire element. The work will consist in correcting our di srupted energies that also introduced psychological and physical problems. These inte ract on each other and can be seen as a vicious circle we are often confronted with. We will therefore act on the structures that have been mistreated in order to consolidat e them and re-establish the circulation of the energies. As in acupuncture, we will do our best to dissolve the knots of energy that are the main reasons for our difficulties on our path. Different methods are applicable according our personal sensitivity. We have offered some methods through our courses in Alchemy, Qabala and Esotericism. In these the manipulation of the energies of the Universe was done through rituals, through plan t or mineral elixirs or through a work of purification followed by a work of enriching the energy. Other methods also exist. The creation of the Universe began with the Ea rth element. The elimination of our scoria accumulated in the Descent will also begin by the regeneration of the Earth element. If we try to reasonably accelerate this process by initiatic means, as in Qabala and in Alchemy, we will trigger a series of dreams, of visions, if necessary of material experiences, which will all concern the mineral world: journeys in spirit to the center of the Earth, in mines, in tunnels, etc. The prac tice of a sport or a science, like caving or deep interest in mineralogy can be, in some cases, a renewed re-balance of the mineral Tree for people having a particular resonance with this Tree. When the Earth energy will have been rebala nced, we will proceed with the regeneration of the Water energy. There, we could dream in a plant world that does not exist on our planet any more, or have dreams in an aquatic environment. Following the order of creation, the rebalance of the Air energy can then be undertaken, frequently triggering nightly experiences where the dreamer moves above ground and eventually flies. The dreams of the animal world do not necessarily co me from this Tree, so it will be better to search for its meaning in the symbolism of the unconscious. The fourth stage of purification will occur naturally, compared to the preceding one. Progress happens on the specific Tree of the el ement that awakens. The Fire energy has in itself a purifying action on all that it animates. For example dreams concerning teeth, which are symbols of this element. Fire is the active part of the Spirit-Energy (Figure 2 ) and has taken authority progressively over the Earth and Water elements of the Matter- Energy.

To those that have established the conversation with the Inne r Master in their previous existence, the Presentation to the Temple takes place at th e age of twelve during a ceremony in the Invisible where the former powers are revive d. The Presentation to the Temple, or the conversation with the Inner Master, often ge nerates two types of specific experiences: one concerns ceremonies of initiation that ta ke place in a landscape and a setting of the past, generally distant by two or three centuries. One cannot remember the physical location of the experience for several years. The other type of experience is similar to the symbolic initiations of the physical world but takes place in a complete out-of-body state. The ceremony takes place in an underground temp le located under the Great Pyramid or in a temple that is evidently not of the Eart h. The action of the Invisible Order intervenes in these ceremonies to give us the necessary means for the esoteric work to be undertaken. Work on the energies practiced in Qabala and in Alchemy momentarily gives the access to the corresponding inner state on levels 9-8-7 and 6 . This contact is not durable. It aims at an energetic rebalance for a certain time in the student. This work allows us to fill up with energy; similarly to what occurs when we go on vacation looking to benefit from the sun, pure air and a healthy lifestyle. Returning to our ordinary life with its difficulties, if we do not know how to keep th is benefit stored during this break, it vanished gradually until it totally disappears. The same phenome non happens in the initiatic contacts where the drawn energy also gradually recedes. Even if the initiatic contact was momentary, it has the enormous advantage that it begins to inform, illuminate and sometimes even instruct us on our Becoming. This can occur as early as level 9 , although it is weak on this level. The student who walks the path s hould work if he wants his initiatic contact to last.

A change in his inner structures occurs that will remain for the duration of the present incar nation. He is now an authentic initiate. We will call him a “Knower”. It was voluntarily that we previously used the expressions “Initiation of Duality” and “Initiation of the Nadir”. The state in whic h each element of the Original Human Seed has been propelled in each of these initiations can be considered as permanent because of their long duration, in the millions of years, and because of the mastery of progressively acquired grounds. From the moment the Fire energy in its active aspect (Figure 2 ) begins to dominate, however slightly in the human structure, the power of creation of man automatically turns towards the “subtle”, the spiritual and the Invisible. The first true initiation that gives the first contact with our inner worlds is the mastery of level 9 . Usually this occurs very slowly. We must remember that the subtle energy of thought in a level is the matter of the level just above. Level 9 , just above 10 , will be woven out of our thought-forms. A small number of beings raise their thoughts to a level subtler than the 9 th ; however the majority doesn’t go higher than this stage. Level 9 is truly cluttered with all manners of thought- forms. Primarily loaded with negative mate riality, it is permanently emitted by the earth population and has been stored since the be ginning of the Descent. Even though it is more subtle than ours in density this first le vel is still perceived like a world of grayish or even dark appearance, despite a growi ng number of individuals striving to emit constructive thoughts. This is why the initiation of this level requires an important work of purification. In order to function there, the being will need to keep only the useful knowledge acquired on level 10 and get rid of the heavy load of the Matter-energy. Let’s recall that junction 10-9 is path 32 in Qabala, illustrated by the tarot card “The World” which is the symbol of the first vision of the Invisible Universe (Figure 4 ). The power of creation on level 8 is accessible to beings that have precisely mastered level 9 . Purified and stripped of the Matter-energy they are no longer subject to its attraction. The perception of the world in 8 at its worst can seem slightly grayish. Only in the beginning will the contact with this plan be seen as visions of fairy tale castles. This is the first stage where walking the path of Return can be accelerated. This level can give and communicate to our consciousness powers and information for a faster cleanup of the levels that have not yet been put back in orde r. This level is the symbol of the mastery of the four elements, the symbol of the doubl e quaternary, 2 times 4. In Alchemy, Mercury is assigned to it, as are Thoth and Hermes in Qabala. Hermes is Mercury, the messenger of the gods, which links the Visible with th e Invisible. The elements of communication are found between “Matter and Spirit” on this level as we touched upon in the Mineral Tree. The initiation on level 7 gives important contacts in th e Water Tree whose nature, also “Active”, joins the Fire one to prepare the delicate passage to the upper level. Level 6 is undoubtedly the essential stage of Retu rn. At this stage, the Initiate has the information of all that is useful to follo w his Path of Return. From there on, lessons, books or teachings are no longer n ecessary. The Initiate of level 6 has become the Master of his Becoming.

Its power of information is due to its place in the center of the Tree where it is in communication with all other worlds. Personal experiences and confidences from co mpanions on the Path confirm that there are two key attributes of this level. The firs t is the conversation with the Inner Master. He can directly give us the instructions c oncerning our own Return in Eternity. To symbolically illustrate this conversation, the “Sepher Yetzirah”, the Book of the Creation, says that “the small king must rise from hi s throne so that the Great King can talk to him”. In other words, the brain of the Earth must be silent to understand the advice from the Inner Heart. The other key attribute is the knowledge of the Path already completed, revealed through a scene unwinding inside a dream, through a vision or during the exteriorization of consciousness. We are seated in a classroom with a podium up front, lined with tables and benches, where the other students are seat ed behind us, and where the teacher at the board gives a course. This teacher is none othe r that the Inner Master or Upper Self. He talks about the role of the pupils behind us, which are none other that our past incarnations or more exactly the afterm ath that remain through our Trees whose structures can still be altered. We are at what is called “Night School”, and there we are taught how we must reduce our difficulties. After each realization, one of the pupils disappears. When we remain alone in the cl assroom, the problems of the past are solved. Then, gradually, the teachings of the Night School change towards our future. At that stage the teaching is no longer done through sy mbols. The teaching becomes direct. The conversation with the Inner Master becomes po ssible. That is what has been named “the conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel”. All our structures must be repaired in this passage on 6 . The part of the Universe enclosing levels 4-5-6 demands a restoration of all the structures of our being since this work no longer possible in 3 . This is probably the basis and the essential reason for the teachings of the Inner Master in the Night School. In order to neither disturb nor slow down the process of the teaching of that School, we must be totally silent on what we live and receive there. On level 8 , the authority on occult powers (authority on the powerful invisible energies) is already awakened. This is even more so on level 6 . These powers must be used only with extreme parsimony and total discretion. One cannot hinder Nature. Meditate to have the perception and the comprehension before having the powers. Always privilege Spirit over Matter. The powers from their related initiations on levels 5 and 4 will only be used upon advice from the Inner Master. Level 5 deals with the use of Energy. Level 4 deals with access to Knowledge. As for level 3 , let’s specify here that the aim of this entire treatise is to try and obtain directly the momentary contact in 3 without going through the long paths of classical initiation. TRANSFER OF ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE To have access to each of the upper levels, th e initiatic work comes with a natural or controlled transfer of the acquired knowledge.

This is how we can harvest the necessary in formation on our Path. As with our behavior on the earth, we must strive towards a flexib ility that will facilitate our “harvesting”. It will be easier for us to direct our work of self-creation when informed. We remind you that this takes place only when we are incarnated, not when we leave this earth. When we leave our visible physical world, life in the Invisible is specific to each of us, as it is in this visible world. However there ar e two life styles in the beyond: the ordinary one and the one of those that in this world have the conversation with the Inner Master. It has symbolically been said: “In my Father’s house that are many mansions”. Those that have not yet had the conversation with the I nner Master live in one of the three levels immediately above the visible world: 9, 8, 7 or in Qabala, Yesod, Hod and Netzach. The level of habitation depends on the spiritual wo rk done in this visible world. To this day, the great majority remains in 9 . All those that started on th e path of Return with good intention, under whichever form, are in 8 or 7 . These worlds are infinitely preferable to level 9 , which is very congested and polluted by negative thoughts. One who has had, down here, the conversati on with the Inner Master resides in 6 . As said in the Bible: “He will be mark ed with a white stone on the forehead so he does not know the second death”. This second death does not m ean the destruction of the structures of the bodies of levels 9, 8 and 7 . It is a sort of purification that removes many elements, in particular in the domain of the memory of the former physical life. Those who can practice the exteriorization of consciousness in the physical world can without damage pass both ways through the veils of birth and death, in other words the passage 10-9 and 9-10 . In the same way, those who have the conversation with the Inner Master can without damage pass by both ways the veil of the second death, which is the passage 7-6 and 6-7 . They will return in the visible world w ith the memory of their former physical life. Meditating on the reasons why Nature imposes the second death before returning to a physical life for all those that do not have the conversation with the Inner Master, the reason seems to be as follows: The Inner Master is our Eternal Self, our only guide on the path of Return in Eternity. If we have the conversation, we have a guide on our Path. But for the others, Nature forces them to a cont act before returning down here, we could say for a “renewal”, in order to steer the incarnati on that follows on the adequate level. It is during that very brief stay after the second death that the elements necessary to his progress will be inserted in the structures of his being. He who has the conversation in his present lif e will remember what was before and this memory will even occur in the first years of his physical life. The body of a young child cannot support the energies awakened by the C onversation. It is not before the age of twelve that the esoteric elements previ ously acquired are awakened again. In the Scriptures, this is therefore symbolized by th e Presentation to the Temple. Any being that has acquired the conversation has the continuity of consciousness. He only knows changes of vehicles. In the interval between two incarnations a re generation cycle is triggered. Stripped of his physical envelope, the being will dissolve his remaining scoria and his partially rebalanced energies are ready again to stru cture another physical envelope.

The baby that is just born is not apt on the first day of his physical life to steer his Path. He must readjust to this world, to its vibratory frequency so he can restart his I tinerary. Besides, during his physical growth, one considers that from: - 0 to 7 years old, the Mineral Tree from which he proceeds is reactivated in him, - 7 to 14 years old, the Plant Tree from which he proceeds is reactivated in him, - 14 to 21 years old, the Animal Tree from which he proceeds is reactivated in him, - From 21 years old on, the being restarts his work on the Tree of Man. In each new incarnation, man is brought to restar t his “work in progress”. This is why in the development of the potentialities of th e human being, we witness people arriving among us who demonstrate gifts in different fields at an early age. It’s because in former lives they have acquired an experience in one of these domains and that furthermore, in their lifetime they had transmitted this acqui sition to their invisible structures. The acquired knowledge is not lost by the destruction of the body on level 10 at the time of death and furthermore this acquisition is transmitted to the new physical vehicle at birth. The most spectacular gifts are most often seen in the art field but also they can be seen in mathematics, medicine, politics, education, etc., which can sometimes equate to an art. There are some mechanisms or functions, simple but useful, that we must train to transfer in levels higher than ours even before beco ming an expert in any domain. For example, the so familiar reading-function is a dec oding exercise that has become unconscious. When we know how to transfer its mechanism in 9 , then we are quite capable in dreams or in projection to read a text that we have in front of our eyes. This text always concerns the dreamer. Another example of transfer is the symbol-function. There is a powerful value in the initiatic symbol used to translat e the energy of the object or the idea that it represents. If we are trained to decipher the symbols appearing on our Path, it will be easy for us when we contact our interior worl ds to perceive the meaning of the symbols that we will encounter. The function is more important and the memory much less. The work consists not so much in charging the memory with information to transfer level after level but in developing systems of func tioning adaptable to the different planes of consciousness. Whatever work we practice in our world, its repetition generates gymnastics, then automation, which become an integral part of our being. This know-how is acquired and by extension, by resonance and imbibitions it can be transferred to all new peripheral layers of the individual in evolution. Tw o planes of neighboring consciousness will slowly be bridged. For example, if we are pa rticularly sentient to music, we are both bearer of the laws of harmony on which it is based and the laws of numbers that have their application in all space-times. This is w hy the fruit of our realization sows its seeds in our inner spaces, even when those appear passive. One can also direct his transfers simply by thinking about it before going to sleep or during a meditation. A sort of memory storage of the acquired mechanisms creates itself step by step.

A head well made is worth more than a head too full or than a head too empty. Already in our space-time of 10 we must reach a flexibility of functioning in our relationships with others and with facts in order to enlarge our own field of consciousness. The conjugated use of Intelligence and Heart will also allow us to “pass through walls” during these transfers. During the Nadir initiation the reversal of ener gies towards the direction of the creative power allows a better transfer in the i nvisible bodies from the acquired knowledge obtained in the visible. What is acquired in 10 must be transferred in 9 . In the same way for the rest of the Return, what is acquired in 9 will be transferred in 8 then in 7 and so on until 3 . The return of all acquired knowledge on all the levels ensures the durability of the results of work from the dense worlds. What space a nd time has allowed us to achieve is saved only by its transfer in Eternity. However what belongs to the time domain disappears with it. This is why the bodies will disappear with time, one af ter the other. As the visible body of 10 disappears and is dissolved, in the same way each of the bodies of the invisible levels, from this earth level on, will be dissolved “in its time” and in its turn. For each level of the invisible, the body construc ted has been the necessary tool towards a definite finality. This finality reached, the tool is no longer useful. THE RETURN IN ETERNITY Some beings have accomplished the path of Return. They now belong to the Unitary world. They are the “Realized”. Each of us in evitably walks towards this Aim. The return of the 4 th Journey is slow, very slow when we become conscious of it. It is finally perceived as an intelligent dynamic to which we contribute fully at some point, which eases its mastery. During the first part of the 4 th Journey, the consciousness of the Human being is far away from Unity. The gregarious instinct pushe d man to live with his fellow humans. He cannot do without parents or friends. Duri ng the Return things are reversed. The consciousness of man begins to turn towards Unity to following its path. The phenomenon of Dispersion is replaced by th e phenomenon of Concentration. When man will be close to the Return in Unity he will be able to live more and more without family or friends. This is not because he will sear ch to be away from his fellow humans but because at this level he is in communion with them almost permanently since he is in constant contact with Nature. During the Descent, where we were an elem ent of the cosmic current, we needed to separate from or to detach from th e Global Current in order to forge our individualization. This necessary separation should not be construed as a will of aversion or even hate. The Return proceeds by bri nging together the Global Current with a tendency towards a fusion. This fusion equates to Universal Love. In our return in Eternity, our consciousness stretches to the “Without Limit”. The time- spaces limits do not exist except in the worlds of duality. On the level of Realization of Unity every Being keeps his Self-Consciousness, in the infinite Omni-Consciousness.

Although Creation is a continuous phenomenon, the problem of overpopulation so metimes mentioned is a false problem. There is no limit to the number of these Points.

The Cubic Stone has become the Polished Stone. The state of consciousness reached is Eternity. It is this state that opens the being to the Consciousness of the Universe.

The famous Tetragrammaton (Yod He Vav He) summarizes and conveys in itself the path of the Being from his Departure in Unity until his Return. Ancient Hebrew is expressed by means of a hieroglyphic writing that is characterized by its equivalence between letters and numbers. Symbols proper to each letter also represent an energy, a level, a being or a thing. Ther efore, the key to understanding the words and the texts in this system is that the sum of the elements carried by the letters gives to the final sense of the designated “thing” a wealth of information. If it were possible to make an analogy in our own system of writing, the coding of which is first of all phonetic, we could then say that for example the word “table” is made up of consonants that represent: the tray, the stability, the use, the materi al, the proportions, etc. We could also, by changing the order of the letters, obtain an anagram the meaning of which remains bound to the first, since based on the same elements. In the Beginning, the Original Tongue is Unitary and corresponds to our consciousness. At that stage it expands to the totality of tim e and to the perception of all the vibrations, in other words to the universality of Knowledge. Our being had straightaway the use of the appropriate language of its level of c onsciousness and its pertaining powers, but the loss of the Original Tongue is a necessity. Fr om its deterioration in the stages of the descent in duality, the multiplication of the languages that the Bible talks about will appear. This diversity of the languages app ears like a multitude of reflections of the Original Language. We can see during differe nt contacts that each of the levels of consciousness has a level of language of its own, not in an exclusive manner but with a particular resonance with the laws of this level. Remember that each alphabet system and all other system of symbols do not have the same aspect in the Descent and in the Return. It is probable that with the global Return of Humanity, the ancient hieroglyphic languages will recover their usefulness. It is also probable that in our world, the Egyptian hieroglyphs have been active before the Hebrew alphabet, which is the last language of the Descent before the advent of our analytic thought. It is also probable that for the Return the first steps towards the Unitary thought will be through ancient Hebrew and later through Egyptian hieroglyphs. The analyti cal alphabet is suited to the present day world, but the symbols or the hieroglyphic writings will be better adapted to the expression of knowledge of the Return. Systems of expression suited for higher levels have been removed from the earth because of their occult power. They will reappear only with the general elevation of human consciousness. In the true hieroglyph, etymologically sacred si gns, a name assigned to a being or a thing not only becomes an authentic symbol but th is name is by itself the very Original © Triad Publishing, 2007.

That is why the authentic hieroglyph is truly a name whose energetic power is at the same time creative power. The vowels that exist in Modern Hebrew are excluded from ancient Hebrew and its pronunciation is unavailable to us. This is why this sacred pronunciation can only be revealed by inner resonance. (Yod He Vav He - Hebrew reads from right to left) improperly named “Yahweh”, is named the “unpronounceable Tetragrammaton” or the “divine Tetragrammaton”. He, who is able to pronounce it, like pronouncing all authentic hieroglyphs, has the creating power of the Origin. This means that it would only take the right pronunciation to create the “thi ng” wished for. “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God”. It is by the Word that all has been created. THE PASSAGE UNITY - DUALITY The unpronounceable name corresponds to the four non-manifested aspects of the Primordial Energy, or to the four alchemical Elements. Figure 13 shows that in the passage Unity-Duality these four aspects of the Energy are manifested in the Human Being. They are also the four columns of the Golden Chain of Homer or the four Trees of Qabala. When the Primordial Energy is not yet manifest ed, it is Unity. When it manifests, it is in Duality where Matter-Energy and Spirit-Ener gy oppose and complete each other. Every being proceeds from the nature of the envir onment in which he evolves: in Unity the Being is Unitary, in Duality he is Dual. They cannot change from of one state to the other without a previous energetic adaptation. In ancient Hebrew texts that relate the Creation, they mention Yahweh Elohim then Elohim. In fact, the Elohim function, rather than the Elohim, consists in the creating power of the Original Essence. This functi on is the only one that remains in the Energy after its passage in Duality. If we want to grasp the nature of the Unitary Being, we could say that he is an eternal Point of Consciousness. In that non-manife sted point the four components of the Primordial Energy are expressed in the al chemical and qabalistic languages as in Figure 14 ( square 1 ). The necessary adaptation to the c ondition of Duality will be a sort of bursting of Unity that is translated by a separation of its components. The examination of the Being of Duality showed us (Figure 2 ) that those primordial energies separated in the following manner: Earth and Water which form the basis of the material structure of the body, the alchemical salt or salt of the earth and Air and Fire which form a set of life-giving principles, the spiritual body, the alchemical Sulphur. In this separation between Matter Energy and Sp irit Energy the cut is not total. If it were, there would be a break such th at it would result in some sort of cosmic death at the boundary of the finished-infinite. This phe nomenon would be similar to death on our physical level because of the impossibility to communicate between Material and Spiritual. However this communication exists. It is ensured by the energetic reunion of Water-Air, also called Mercury. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Only two possibilities exist in the separation of the primordial energies: separation of the Earth element from the set Earth-Water-Air-Fire or separation of the Fire element from the same set. Since the penetration in the density always requires the presence of the Earth element, which is the main-element of the density, we will have: Earth-Water-Air, on one hand, and Fire on the other. All the aspects of the Primordial Energy are presen t in each of the four journeys (Figure 11 ), even if they are not really activated. It is more a differentiation of the Primordial Energy than a separation strictly speaking. This di fferentiation manifests by the supremacy of some elements of the energy on others, according to the times of the creation. The hour of the Fire element means that this one is pre dominant but the three others: Air, Water and Earth are also present although at a lesser rate. All in nature is balance and all is always present. There is only predominance. We must not forget that all is relative in our world. We can say that in this world: “there is an absolute, which is that there is no absolute”. ADAM AND EVE Take Figure 14 ( square 1 ): - (Yod) is Fire; it will be the life-giving principle. - The first (He) is Air; it will be the Spiritual body. - (Vav) is Water; it is the strength that will push the curiosity for knowledge towards matter. - The second (He) is Earth; it will be the channel, the material body. - (Yod-He), Fire-Air, corresponds to what will be our Spiritual Being. - (Yod) Fire is the energy that animates the first (He) the spiritual body. - (Vav-He), Water-Earth, corresponds to what will make up our material structures. (Vav) Water is the energy that animates the second (He) the material body. In square 2 on this figure, we see that the Initiation of Duality has placed (Yod) or Fire, the life-giving energy, under the denser elements (He-Vav-He) or Air-Water- Earth. The life-giving principle, (Yod) or ADAM, is dominated by the EVE principle. This is not the woman, but the part of the Being that induces birth by the creation of the dense worlds necessary to the evolution of consciousness. When the set or EVE is predominant, the creating power of the Bei ng is turned towards Matter. The descent in the dense worlds is possible and the cr eation begins. Matter dominates Spirit by provoking the descent in the worlds of dar kness. The HE VAV HE is a mutilated being that disregards the YOD, his spiritual side. We must grasp the image of darkness by basing ourselves on the principle of equivalence between energy and matter valid on all levels. In this principle, the creation of dense matter absorbs energy. The energy then lowers in intensity and the light does the same. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The expression “darkness” must not be understood literally, but rather with the se nse of limitation. This is a limitation for consciousness in its field of perception.

The Initiation of the Nadir begins. Then Fire becomes the main element that dominates the combined (squares 3). The EVE principle is dominated by the ADAM principle. Now Spirit dominates Matter and the Original Human Seed springs towards the subtle energy worlds, freeing itself in stages from dense matter. Unavoidably The Return has been triggered.

NUMEROLOGY (Figure 15 ) Here is a quick numerological approach from the two Names: (Yod-He-Vav-He) “The Original Being” and (Aleph-He-Yod-He) “the New Being”. When comparing, we note that (Yod-He), the spiritual body in Duality, became the “material” body in Eternity. (Aleph) and (Yod) are the letters that represent the Energy of the Absolute: - has a value of 1, it is the Energy issued from the Absolute in Unity. - has a value of 10, it is also the Energy issued from the Absolute but in Duality. Concerning the structure of the Being in Duality, we have: Yod = 10, He = 5, Vav = 6, He = 5, that gives a total of 26 If we take in account the existing links betw een different Hebrew names - either on the letter level, or on the level of the numbers - the Hebrew language has several words that have and equivalent numerical value of 26. For example, the name: (Chet- Vav-Zayin-He) whose sum of letters decomposes like this: Chet = 8, Vav = 6, Zayin = 7, He = 5 This name means: vision, sight. The corres pondence between these two names, of value 26, implies that the Being in Duality (Yod-He-Vav-He) is the bearer of “sight” and that (Chet-Vav-Zayin-He), vision, is itself indivisible from the nature of the Being. Another way of studying the correspondence between letters and numbers is the following: Number 26 can be studied like being the sum of: 13 + 13. Number 13 represents, among others possibilities, the sum of the letters of the name: (Aleph-He-Beth-He) where: Aleph = 1, He = 5, Beth = 2, He = 5 This word means: love.

Number 8 is also the sum of the name: (Aleph-He-Beth) whose numerical decomposition is: Aleph = 1, He = 5, Beth = 2, this word meaning “desired, beloved”.

It is undeniable that to penetrate the sense of a sacred language only inner resonance drives revelations. The “material” elements of the st ructure of the Being in Duality (Vav-He) - or Water and Earth - permitted the awakening of Self-Consciousness through our spiritual elements (Yod-He), or Fire and Air, In Unity these will be the “material” elements whose function will allow the awakening of the Self-Consciousness of the New Being: (Aleph-He), our Absolute.

The Experience of Eternity is not an initiation as defined previously (See: the Return), but it reaches the highest Point of Inner Contact that man can undergo. It is the only experience, on this Earth, that “marks” us and that lasts in us beyond the present life. It will remain printed in our future existen ces or incarnations, and that until the end of Times. In the method proposed here, which is different from the Qabala one where it is taught to bring the energy down, we will be making a provi sion of energy when Nature is generous in this domain. The energy freely present and naturally available is always of a higher quality than the energy that was “constrained”. Our rule of work will follow the adage of Solomon: “There is a time to be born, “There is a time to die, “There is a time for each thing”. Therefore our preparation will focus solely on the astronomically favorable times. THE PLANETARY ENERGY (FIGURE 16 ) The Original Energy is unique and as it ma nifests in Duality, it creates levels of coagulation. Each of these sends back, in space and in time, a specific energetic influx from which we proceed. In our solar system, the planets have also been created in the course of time, like all things, from the different energy levels. In consequence, there exists an order of succession of the planetary energies matching the order of densification of the Unitary Energy in Duality: - Level 3 : energy of Saturn - Level 4 : energy of Jupiter - Level 5 : energy of Mars - Level 6 : energy of the Sun - Level 7 : energy of Venus - Level 8 : energy of Mercury - Level 9 : energy of the Moon As for level 10 , where we are, it is the point of convergence of all the energies © Triad Publishing, 2007.

We know the solar system has a fixed number of live planets. We also know that a certain number of observers think that a mi nuscule celestial body turns around the Sun. According to them, its revolution around the S un would take less than 20 days. If this were the case, the sun is birthing a planet al ready named Vulcan, planet of Fire. In this case, the shift would be: Vulcan would replace Mercury; Mercury would replace Venus; Venus would replace the Earth; the Earth would replace Mars; Mars would replace Jupiter; Jupiter would replace Saturn; Satu rn becomes a gaseous planet and finally disappears in the cosmos. This cycle evoked in ancient traditions is extremely slow and occurs in the span of several millions of years. In addition to the energies emitted by the planets, consider the energies given by the signs of the zodiac. One hypothesis is that the sun radiates twelve rays in the plane of the ecliptic. This does not appear plausible becau se the sun rotates in a little more than 24 days, so that if these twelve rays were bound to the physical body of the Sun, they would have to rotate with it. In this case, the influences of a sign would have duration of approximately two days. If these rays of energy were fixed, the precessions of the equinoxes would be without action on the signs. This drives us to consider that the action of the signs is not bound by the orientation but by the Sun’s height above and below the ecliptic. Its energies are not emitted by ellipses centered on the Sun but located above or below its equator. In this case, the precession of the equinoxes would become understandable again since it determines the moment when the rise becomes positive. For the Ancients, Saturn is the High point in the Sky. They do not take into account any of heavenly bodies farther away such as Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Present day esotericists also consider these faraway bodies as “corpses” because they no longer possess Life, compared to live planets that radi ate the energy of the four elements. On the physical level, the structure of these three bodies has become again quite gaseous. Pluto is even solidified in ice considering its dist ance from the Sun. From an energetic point of view, their radiation in the Fire and Air el ements is almost nonexistent. The boundary of the “live” solar system in contact with the universe is therefore the Saturn orbit, the greatest sphere of our system. The astronomic succession of the planets (Figure 16 ) does not quite correspond to their energy succession displayed above. In fact, we must give the Sun the privileged place it occupies in regards to its satellite planets, and in particular the Earth. The Earth orbit determines a sphere centered on the Sun. Outside of this sphere, we find the orbits of the outer planets: Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, intermediate between the universe and the Earth. Inside of this sphere we find the orbits of the interior planets: Venus and Mercury. The moon is not a planet from an astronomical point of view. However, in esotericism, it is considered as one of the seven planets that correspond to the seven levels of coagulation of the energy. It is the Moon that controls the arrival of the energies on Earth. Concerning Saturn from an astronomical point of view, its orbit is in contact with the universe. From an energy point of view, its s phere, on level 3 - limit Duality-Unity - is in contact with Eternity from which it receives directly the energy in which it still bathes . Saturn then diffuses its energy to the sphere of Jupiter that in turn radiates towards the Mars sphere.

The Earth is the receptacle of all these energies. We only take into account here the energy of the invisible levels and not the energy produced by the speed at which the planets move. For each level of density the pulsed energy is different according to the hours and cy cles of the day. Thanks to this, we can perform the steps of the Great Experience, whic h process is to gather the greatest possible reserve of energy under certain conditions. CYCLE OF SEVEN The impulses of energy manifested in Dua lity follow each other in time and in space, each of them linked to a level. At the sevent h impulse, level 10 has received “its share of energy” from each level of the invisible Dualit y. This is the origin of the cycle of seven that presides over the emission of the planetary energies. Another cycle of seven we are familiar with is the seven days of the week. From an esoteric point of view, we consider that th e first day of the week is neither Monday nor Sunday but Saturday (Figure 17 ). This cycle is linked to th e cycle of the week. The first impulse of the planetary energy received on Earth is from Saturn on Saturday. The second one is from the energy of Jupiter, the third from the Mars energy and this continues until the seventh impulse, from the energy of the Moon. This cycle of seven continually repeats itself with a new impulse of the Saturn energy. This cycle of seven is reproduced each day of the week. On Sunday, the first impulse received is from the energy of the Sun, the second is from the Venus energy, the third, from Mercury, etc. After the seventh impulse, the Mars one, the cycle starts again by the impulse from the energy of the Sun. Monday begi ns with the impulse of the energy of the Moon, Tuesday with the Mars energy, Wednesday with Mercury, Thursday with Jupiter and Friday with Venus. This cycle of seven energies is known as th e cycle of the seven Planetary Geniuses, the seven Geniuses of the Throne, the seven Genius es of the Presence, etc. We are not talking about the usual concept of angels, archange ls, or other celestial cohorts, but about the influx of a particular energy having a link with a given planet. This theory concerning the rhythm of pre-eminence of the seven energies in Nature is described fairly well in Cornelius Agrippa’s “The Occult Philosophy”. The order of the seven days of the week, the names of which come from the planets, is not identical to the order of the seven plan etary energies based on “the speed of the planets”. This latter name was incorrectly a ssigned by the Tradition. It can be interesting to see the overlap between these two cycles of seven. Figure 18 shows the tracing of the 7-pointed star, from 1 to 7, following the a rrows without lifting the pencil. Once you have traced it, write down successively the order of the days of the week, from point number 1 to point number 2, from point 2 to point number 3 and so on to point number 7. When every day is written, you can read the seven planetary influxes clockwise. In addition to the cycle of seven, another cycl e giving rhythm to the flow of time is the cycle of twelve: 12 angles of 30 degrees that share the zodiac and 12 months of the year, © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night, etc. Th is daily cycle will allow us to know the nature of the planetary energy influx at a given hour, the cycles of 7 and 12 overlapping. CYCLE OF TWELVE The cycle of twelve that governs our hourly cl ocks is given by the rotation of the Earth on itself within the solar system. Due to its rotation, the Earth will “collect” successively on the level of its orbit the seven planetary energies that are distributed on its entire surface. On the level of these two cycles there are overlaps we will attempt to untangle. Look again at Figure 17 where the cycle of twelve and the cycle of seven are shown in correspondence. Day and night are divided in twelve hourly sequences. We could conclude that the duration of the day and the duration of the ni ght are equal. This situation is true only during the spring and fall equinoxes (Figure 19 ). During the summer solstice, the number of day hours is greater than the number of night hours, and during the winter solstice, the number of day hours is smaller than the numbe r of night ones. During most of the year, the number of hours of day and the number of hours of night stretch between these extremes. The table in Figure17 does not indicate the sequences of 60 minutes of our clocks, except at the time of the equinoxes. It indicates sequences of more or less 60 minutes, during which the energy of the planets manifests its elf. This energy is of different quality depending on whether it is pulsed during daytime or during nighttime. In this system of planetary energies, the divi sion of the real length of the day and of the night in twelve sequences is an intangible ru le, whichever time of the year. We must also first consider: - The real duration of the day that is deducted from Sunrise until Sunset. - The real duration of the night that is deducted from the Sunset until its new rise. Then we consider the total duration of the da y part that will be divided in twelve equal sequences as well as the total duration of the night part. The sequences of planetary influx will be of different duration from one day to th e next and from one night to the other. For the convenience of this purpose, we will name these sequences: planetary hours in order to not confuse them with the circadian hours of 60 minutes each. Let’s take an example to illuminate preci sely our purpose. Suppose that we are in November, that sunrise is at 7:00 AM a nd sunset at 5:00 PM (use 17:00 for the calculations) and sunrise the next day is at 7:12 AM, we will have: - a day with a duration of: 17:00 -7:00 = 10 hours or 600 minutes. - a night with a duration of: ( 24:00 - 17: 00 ) + ( 7:12 ) = 14 hours 12 minutes or 852 minutes. As far as the duration of “the planetary hour”, we will have: - Between sunrise and sunset: 600 minutes / 12 = 50 minutes, so we have “planetary hours” of day with duration of 50 minutes. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity - Between the sunset and the following rising: 852 minutes /12 = 71 minutes, so planetary hours of night last 71 minutes. Suppose that these calculated timetables concern a Thursday. With sunrise at 7 A.M., the influx of the first energy, the Jupiter one, w ill be active from 7:00 to 7:50. The Mars influx will then be active for 50 minutes from 7:50 to 8:40, followed by the influx of the Sun for 50 minutes from 8:40 to 9:30 and so on until the 12 th daytime planetary hour of 50 minutes, the Mercury one. The first nigh ttime planetary hour will be active for 71 minutes under the influx of the moon. It is followed by the Saturn influence for 71 minutes, then by Jupiter and so on until the 12 th nighttime planetary hour of 71 minutes, the Sun hour. For all practical purpose, some traditional cale ndars can give the sunrise and sunset for a major city, but ephemeredes will give these hours for all locations. Even better, the calculation of the planetary hour you are looki ng for can be found in computer programs, freeware or commercially available. IMPACT OF THE PLANETARY ENERGY Take Figure 17 (2nd column, “cycle of seven”). Daily there are three complete cycles of seven planetary impulses, or 21 impulses. The 4 th cycle was started with three impulses but it is incomplete, and it will continue and finish the next day. The successions of the planetary impulses continue in their regular orde r from one day to the next, indefinitely in time and in space. The first impulse of the day is from the planet which radiation will dominate for 24 hours, hence the origin of the names of the days of the week. The influence of the planet of the day is called “ruler” because of its intensity. The influx of the other planets is somewhat weakened. From an esoteric point of view, the planetary ruler of the day is considered as the “leader” of the 6 other planets. Daily the influence of this leader is such that we are driven to consider it like the starting point of a new cycle of seven. We do not take into account the last unfinished cycle of the previous day. This way of looking at each new day, starting with a new cycle, keep the sequence of the successive influxes. It does have a practical advantage: it arranges the intensity of the planetary energies of which we will make appropriate use. Apart from the fact that the energy of the plan etary ruler of the day is dominant, its influx is increased at every planetary hour in the be ginning of each cycle of seven impulses. It is true at the 1 st and 8 th hour of day and at the 3 rd and 10 th hour of night. The peak energy is during the first planetary hour of the day since at this stage it is particularly “new” or pure because no other energy has yet been added. This is relevant for the 1 st “hour” of Saturn on Saturdays, for the 1 st hour of the Sun on Sunday, for the 1 st hour of the Moon on Monday, etc. Consequently, certain hours w ill be more favorable to our work than others. For example, if you are thinking of doing a meditation during the Mercury hour, you now know that Wednesday is the most appropriate day and that four hourly sequences are more favorable and more “energetic” than a ll the others that day. You also know that among the four sequences, the first is still more energetic than the three following and the © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity second more energetic than the two following, th e third more energetic than the last, itself more energetic than all the sequences concerning the other planets. On Figure 17 we see the four elements placed beside a cycle of seven and the last one is incomplete. What could seem to be an imbalance is only an appearance because the passive Earth element has a higher function of recipient of energies than an animating one. On this Figure, it is easy to understand that the first planetary hour of the day will be reinforced each day by the Fire energy, precisely at the hour of sunrise. This effect will be particularly amplified on Sundays. Another way of placing the four elements is to consider that the Fire and Air energies have an action during the daytime part of the day and the Water and Earth energies have one during the nighttime part (Figure 19 ). The energetic influx of the Fire and Air elements, of spiritual nature, a dds to the influx of the day and a fortiori to the ruling influx. Inversely, the energetic influx of the Water and Earth elements is added to the received influx during the night and they accentuate the minor or “material” aspect. In regards to the four elements, there is an analogy between the phenomenon of the predominance of the energies Earth and Water during the twelve nighttime planetary hours and the descending strength during Invol ution. This is also true between the predominance of the Air and Fire energies during the twelve daytime planetary hours and the ascending strength during Evolution. The cycle of twelve is no more arbitrary than the cycle of seven. All the “things” created, whatever their aspect, have been created with the same laws of numbers. It is difficult to bring a mechanistic explanation to the phenome non of the cycles and to the impact of the different energies. However, we can observe so me effects in the laboratory, notably in the making of spagyric stones that will work onl y at the hours of the pre-eminence of the plant’s assigned energy. Similarly, some exercises practiced in Qabala have results only if practiced according to the hours of the planetary ruler. It is these confirmations that drive us to “use” the planetary energies in this treatise. A better knowledge for each one of us will of course always come from inner revelation.

In the precedi ng chapter, we underlined the influence of the four elements during the daily ro llout of the planetary influx (Figure s 17 ). In this chapter, we will discover the annual periods wh ere these four types of energy dominate in Nature. Our interest is of course as always to benefit from these. PROPERTIES OF THE ELLIPSE The planets in their course around the sun do not describe a circle but an ellipse that is like a circle slightly crushed. The circle has one center but the ellipse has two foci. Placed on the major axis of the ellipse the foci ar e in symmetrical position in relation to the minor axis. The ellipse traveled by the earth around the sun is represented on Figure 20 . V.S. and I.S. are the two foci. On this diagram, line AB is the major axis of the ellipse. This line joins the two opposite points of the ellipse, where the distance is at its maximum. Its direction is fixed. Its longitude in the solar system is very close to 282-102 degrees (Figure 22 ). Line CD is the minor axis. It joins two opposed poi nts of the ellipse where the distance is minimal. The minor axis CD is perpendicular to the major axis AB and cuts it in the middle. Furthermore the sum of the distances VS-P and P-IS is constant regardless of the position of P on any given point of the ellipse. Our Sun that we call “visible Sun” ( V.S.) is on one of the focus point of the ellipse formed by the Earth. Its second focus is not visible. We name it “invisible Sun” ( I.S. ). In the same manner each planet generates two foci in the ellipse that it forms around our Sun. The first focus is always occupied by the Sun itself, named above visible Sun, and the second by an invisible sun, specific to each planet. We specify that the astronomic positions of the invisible suns are fixed in the solar system. These elements concerning the properties of the ellipse must remain present in mind if we want to grasp the energetic repercussions that this implies. Here we are of course dealing with two foci of energy. These properties have been extensively studied by some builders of the past that knew how to put them in app lication. There exist halls of ellipsoidal form in some cloisters or castles where two peopl e whispering, placed with their back to each other and each on one of the foci of the ellipse can understand one another clearly without being heard by the pe ople outside of the foci. In this case, the sound energy emitted by one of the foci is reflected on the other. In our Solar System this phenomenon of transfer of energy from a focus to the other ensures the junction between the Matter- energy and the Spirit-energy. We will study its intensity periods. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

When the earth is at point B of its orbit we are close to June 21 st , date of the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere. Th is day is placed in a period of the year where the energies of life ar e at their strongest intensity. Despite the greatest distance from our Sun (V.S.), we receive a maximum of physical energy. This is due to the angle of incidence of the solar energy in relation to the surface of the Earth. During the summer solstice we are also at the closest distance from our own Invisible Sun (I.S.), and this is where our interest will be. The important vital energy that we receive at that time, because the solar energi es are the most active in the year, comes only in part from the physical sun (V.S.). The essential part of this vital energy comes especially from the focus where the invisi ble sun (I.S.) is. The subtle energy that emanates from it is then pushed towards the earth by the “solar wind”. It is different when the earth is at point A of its orbit. It then is December 21 st during the winter solstice. This day is placed at a time of the year when the en ergies of life are at their minimum intensity and nature itself been slowed down. We are at the greatest distance from I.S. but at the shortest distan ce from V.S. since it is the time of the year when the Earth is closest to the Sun. At this time, the most active energies are the farthest away and furthermore they are occulted by th e physical body of V. S. and by the passage of its electromagnetic environment as shown in Figure 21 . When in its elliptic travel the Earth arrives in X, it enters in the area where the radiation of I.S. begins to be weakened by the electroma gnetic aura of the sun (V.S.). In x the Earth enters the area where the occultation of the I.S. energies will be total up to point y. From y to Y the radiations from I.S. filter through to regain strength in Y. Within a delta of a few hours, each of the distances covered: Xx, xy, yY lasts more or less a week. Therefore 10 to 11 days before the winter solstice (A) a nd 10 to 11 days after, the solar energy is the lowest of the year. We will have to take it into account in our Experience. Astronomic measures show that the distance I.S. - V.S. or (D) is equal to 5 times the solar diameter (d). The result is that the angle tr aveled through by the Earth on its orbit (X-I.S.- Y) during the total occultation of I.S. is 11 degrees; that represents a time of distance covered of: 365 days x (11degrees / 360 degrees), or a little over 11 days. One can reasonably consider that the weaken ing of energy coming from the Invisible Sun (I.S.) due to the passage of the electromagnetic aura of the Sun (V.S.) has appreciably the same duration. These observations complete, we now have to specify an important fact: the total Energy coming from the Universe is transmitted in its Earth and Water aspect by the Visible Sun and in its Fire and Air aspect by the Invisible Sun. This property is valid for all the planets. On Earth the physical solar energies Earth and Water are dissociated from the spiritual energies at the time of the winter solstice. This holds true for the northern © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Past this period, these physical energies remain available jointly with the spiritual energies: Air and Fire, although their intensities vary as a function of the time of the year. We can draw an analogy between the descent of the energies during the Involution and the period that spreads from the summer solstice to the winter solstice. In a similar fashion, there is analogy between the climb of the energies during the Evolution and the period that spreads between the winter solsti ce and the summer solstice. In fact, on all the levels of creation, we unceasingly find this phenomenon of passivity-activity, repulsion- attraction, Matter-Spirit, like a gigantic universal breathing. In the work we will have to conduct, we will use the Energy of the Universe at the times when each of its four aspects is the most profitable for us. We will then have to capture it, fix it and restore it for a well-defined use during the Great Experience. We will need the energies of Saturn, the Moon and the Sun. SATURN The Invisible Sun of Saturn is the key to our process for the Contact of Eternity due to its specific properties. (Figure 22 , where its location can only be approximated). Since the orbit of Saturn is very oval, its Invi sible Sun is located very far from the Visible Sun, about 157,000,000 kilometers. The distance of the Invisible Sun of Saturn to the Earth varies in a ratio of 300/7. The semi-major axis of the Saturn ellipse is fixed in the sky and crosses the zodiac on longitude 272- 92 degrees. The earth is approximately 150,000,000 kilometers from the sun (S.V.). This is a unique case where the Invisible Sun of Saturn is exterior to the orbit of the Earth and we will take advantage of this situation. When the Earth reaches 272-92 degrees, the long itude of the Invisible Sun of Saturn, we will then have the configuration of Figure 23. The earth will be about 7,000,000 kilometers from the Invisible Sun of Satu rn and on the prolongation of the semi-major axis of its ellipse. This happens around June 26 th when the influences of the Fire and Air energies of the Invisible Sun of Saturn are at their maximum. They are already very strong twelve days before this date and rema in strong in the following twelve days. This is indicated on Figure 23 where Earth is in position 1 and 3. Furthermore the close longitudes of the semi-major axis of the Sa turn (272-92) and Earth (282-102) orbits give simultaneously a particularly high power to th e energies of the Sun (S.V.) and Saturn which then conjugate their effects. This is the reason why at that time we can comfortably try the Great Experience for three consecutive weeks. THE MOON The energy of the Moon is the third element necessary to our Experience (Figure 24 ). The Moon rotates around the Earth. Its path is also an ellipse. But the specificity of our satellite is that one of the foci of its orbit is not the Sun (S.V.), as in the former case, but the Earth itself. The second invisible focus is then an “Invisible Earth” (I.E.) and not an Invisible Sun. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Contrarily to the invisible suns already studied, that point is not fixed but moves around the Earth at the same speed as the Saros. This Saros cycle will be defined hereunder. The plane of the orbit of the Moon is angled in relation to the plane of the Ecliptic. The Moon travels above and below the Ecliptic during its path around the Earth. The point where the moon crosses the ecliptic upwards is named Ascending Node (A.N.) or Head of the Dragon (H.D.). The Moon then rises until its apogee, that point where it is at its highest altitude above the ecliptic. It comes down and crosses the plane of the ecliptic at the point named Descending Node or Tail of the Dragon. It continues its path until its perigee, that point where it is at the lowest below the Ecliptic, and starts its cycle around the Earth again. We use the conventional language that consider s that the vertical astronomic direction is parallel to the axis of the Earth and that the top is on the side of the North Pole of this axis. The line that joins the Ascending Node and th e Descending Node is not fixed in the sky. It is called “the line of the Nodes”. It does a complete cycle in 18 years 11-1/3 days. This time is named the Saros. It is the cyclic time of the eclipses of the Moon and Sun. On Figure 24 we can see, aligned with Earth, the invisible focus of the Moon, I.E, and the Moon itself when it is at its apogee and when it is at its perigee. The apogee and the perigee can be found in astronomical tables. One can also determine them knowing that the apogee is at the mid point between the pa ssage of the Head and the Tail of the Dragon and that the perigee is at the mid point betw een the passage of the Tail and the Head of the Dragon. This data is obtained easily in astrological tables. Three or four days after the passage of the Head of the Dragon, the Moon is at point A. Three or four days at most before the passa ge of the Tail of the Dragon, the moon is at point B. When the Moon travels through the space located between A and B, and provided that it is visible in our sky, the energi es that it radiates and those radiated by the Invisible Earth are available. The solar en ergy, polarized by the Moon, contributes to it. When the Moon is at its apogee the four energies will be maximum and simultaneous. The Fire and Air energies are coming from th e invisible focus or Invisible Earth (I.E.) and the Water and Earth energies are the en ergies coming from the Moon that polarized the energies of the Sun (S.V.). Unlike other planetary systems, there is no occultation of the energies for the Earth (V.E.). But when the Moon is at its perigee, the Fire and Air energies arrive on one face of the Earth and the Water and Earth energies on the opposite face. This could allow us to separate the Fire and Air lunar energies from the Water and Earth ones.

Its distance from the Sun (V.S.) is relatively small, approximately 30,000,000 kilometers; it will therefore always be enclosed inside the orb it of the Earth. It cannot be represented on the scale of the Figure. The influence of the I nvisible Sun of Jupiter will have a slight maximum in March-April and will be practically occulted in October-November. MARS The longitude of the Invisible Sun of Mars is of 155-335 degrees (Figure 25 where it can only be approximately represented). Its dist ance from the Sun (V.S.) is approximately 22,000,000 kilometers, clearly enclosed inside Ea rth’s orbit. Its influence will be at a maximum in February-March and will be occulted end of August - early September. VENUS The Venus orbit is enclosed inside the Earth’s (Figure 26 ). This orbit is almost circular and its Invisible Sun (longitude 130-310 degrees) is almost enclosed in the Sun (V.S.). This explains the symbol of this plane t: Love. Its energies do not vary much. The influences of the four energies of this pl anet vary only with the Venus-Earth distance. This variation is simultaneous for the four energies. The occultation of the energies when Venus pa sses behind the Sun is very rare. The tilt of the Venus orbit in relation to the ecliptic makes it pass “above or below the horizon of the Sun”. It is therefore not very likely that th e Venus occultation will have an impact in our work. MERCURY The longitude of the Invisible Sun of Mercury is 257-77 degrees (Figure 26 where its location is approximate). The orbit of this planet is also enclosed inside the Earth’s. It is relatively small but its strong eccentricity places its Invisible Sun about 7,000,000 kilometers from the sun (V.S.). The influen ce of its Invisible Sun will be maximum mid- May to mid-July. It will be occulted from December 8 th to the 16 th . FROM THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE The impact of the material and spiritual energi es of the planets concerns the inhabitant of the northern hemisphere on Earth. However, the action of the Invisible Suns is reverberated differently in the two hemisphe res. Considering the tilt of the plane of the ecliptic, when the northern hemisphere is in the summer solstice for example, the southern hemisphere is in the winter solsti ce and when the northern hemisphere is in the winter solstice, the southern hemisphere is in the summer solstice. This does not apply to the impacts of the Matter and Spirit energies. Here are some clarifications intended for the students of the southern hemisphere. For these students, as far as the Invisible Sun of the Earth and the Invisible Sun of Saturn are concerned, the most favorable moment to receive their maximum energies, Fire and © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This is between the fall equinox and the spring equinox and more particular ly around the winter solstice of their hemisphere. At this time, the Earth and Wa ter energies will be weak. During the summer solstice of the southern hemisphere, the Fire and Air energies will be weak, while the Earth and Water energies will be strong. In this hemisphere a phenomenon of pendulum between the spiritual and material energies is created, whereas in the northern hemisphere the four energies will be at their maximu m of power simultaneously. The conditions of the Experience will be less favorable in the s outhern hemisphere because of the angle of incidence of the solar rays on the surface of the globe. The invisible suns of the other planets do not present any difficulty. Only the influence of the Invisible Sun of Mercury will be less important. Note: The astronomical values used in this chapter are taken from “Handbook of Chemistry and Physics - C.R.C. Press” or have been calculated from data in this book. Summary: - Each planet radiates an energy determined by its own resonance and level. This energy comes from the undetermined Universal Energy. - The physical body, the planet, radiates main ly the Earth and Water aspects of this energy. - The Invisible Sun of the planet radiates mainly the Fire and Air aspects of this energy. - In the northern hemisphere and when the planet is above the ecliptic, the Fire and Air elements are favored and the influences are more constructive. - If the planet is below the ecliptic the influences are cold and not very constructive. Our insisting on the properties of the ellipse is aimed at underlining the junction between the two types of energy in Nature. We, inhabitants of planet Earth, undergo the ever- changing variations of the energy radiated by th e Sun (V.S.) or by the Invisible Sun (I.S.). During its orbital travel, the Earth sends back pa rt of the energies of the Invisible towards the visible and vice versa. It is this ener getic pendulum that ensures the subtle link between the Spiritual and the Material in Nature. This phenomenon could not happen if the path of the planets were not elliptical. Knowing the times when the influences of the planetary energies are the most active, we will learn to collect them at the opportune mome nts in view of our successful Contact of Eternity.

We have therefore arrived at a stage where we can begin the necessary preparations towards the Great E xperience which occurs around the 21 st and 26 th of June, when the four combined energies of th e Sun and of Saturn are the strongest (Figure 20 and 23) . BALANCE OF THE ENERGIES Balance is one of the great principles that govern the energies in nature. All unbalance is temporary and strives towards a new ba lance. Take the well-known example of communicating vessels. When they are filled w ith a liquid at different heights, two or several vessels balance the level of their cont ent when we create a link between them. If one of the vessels receives more liquid, imme diately the vessels rebalance. Concerning the energies in nature, the analogy can apply with the caveat that it is not necessary to create a link between them. This link of balance always exists and is established spontaneously in all of creation on each of its levels. According to this law, we can, on our level, not only recharge in energy on the physical level but also on the psychic level. On the contrary, if our conditions of life are not good, we can rapidly discharge from our negative energies that generate distortions on the physical and mental levels. It is therefore necessary to keep a good general balance and also to know sources to regenerate. The Experience of the Point is one of these sources. NECESSITY OF ENERGETIC ENRICHMENT It is possible to capture the physical energi es of our terrestrial environment without exhausting their source (electricity, heat, light, etc.). It is likewise possible to capture the permanent energy transmitted from different hi gher levels. We will do this by “charging” different bodies, such as water, a plant or a cr ystal from the energy of a given level. Each of these bodies that will be charged, will be qualified as “symbolic objects”, and will be a relay at a time when we will be energetically deficient. However, if we do not want the subtle energies from the levels above to re turn spontaneously to their level, we must intervene to keep them imprisoned at the time of our preparation. We must not ignore that the all-important i nner preparation requires a strong quantity of energy both physical and mental because it can create a certain state of momentary weakness. This state of deficiency is incr eased at the time of a high-level energetic contact. In spite of the contribution of high psychic energy there is an important loss of physical energy. Similarly to what happens at the time of a surgical operation, there is an important elimination of the harmful energi es or “disharmonious” ones from our inner vehicles during this Experience. This eradi cation momentarily puts the subject in a state of extreme weakness. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity If in the beginning, the personal energy available to the operator is excessively deficient the Experience will not occur. In fact, th e Inner Master “knows” if we have enough energy, and triggers the Experience, as a func tion of our reserves. If we have energy in excess, the unpleasant period of great fatigue and weakness will hardly occur. To secure a sufficient reserve of energy in view of our Contact, we will have to store it. To do this we will proceed with an operation of enriching, or loading, symbolic objects. These will fix the energy and will act as sort s of electric accumulators. This contribution of compensating energy will considerably re duce an eventual unpleasant aspect in the Contact of Eternity, and by the same token facilitate its access. METHODS FOR CHARGING There are different methods for charging the sy mbolic objects with energy. Most of these result from rituals of invocation during whic h we proceed with invocations of energy. This is the Qabalistic method, where we opera te progressively, and also in magic where we operate with authority, forcing the laws of Nature. The energies charged by constraint do not possess the quality of the energies loaded naturally. This is especially true in the practice of magic where the operator gives an or der to Nature, as he is never certain the transfer he commands on the energies will fo llow the path he envisioned. Most often the energy is taken where it is, on any given level. In this case, there is a certain risk of alteration of the purity of the required energy. Quite often the disruption in the work of Nature has consequences for the apprentice-sorcerer. It is useful here to issue a warning: We must never lose sight of that fact that man is a small cosmos linked permanently with the great one that bathes him in its manifestations. The Energy of Unity is infinite but the ma nifested energy in Duality is limited in quantity. We could call it measured, a function of the work of Nature. As soon as there is an anarchic removal at any level, except level 3 , Nature manages to re-establish its Balance according to the principle of the communicating vessels. It serves Itself instantaneously, drawing the complement ary energy where it can access it. On the macrocosmic scale, that translates into cat aclysmic events. On the microcosmic scale, it always translates by jolts that, for man, are true cataclysms from which he recuperates much slower than Mother Nature. Contrary to the methods of charging by constr aint, there exist natural methods that we recommend. Some consist in exposing the symbolic objects directly to the planetary radiations to collect the Matter-Energy, Earth and Water, to the benefit of our physical constitution. This is only practical for the Sun and the Moon. When it comes to Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus, it is extremely difficult to have the pure energies directly due to the slowness of their calendar. The enthusiasts of astronomy can follow that path. They will sometimes have to resort to mechanical tricks to occult the radiation of certain planets, the presence of which would be a hindrance. Remaining faithful to the natural method, our other solution consists in using precisely the natural cycles of the variations of the energies, namely the cycle of the planetary energies as well as the cycle of the influx of the Invisible Suns. The Invi sible Suns will give us the Spirit-Energy, Air and Fire, for the benefit of our Spiritual c onstitution. We are convinced that this method is both the simplest and the safest. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Too much haste can harm the unfolding of the Experience. The most favorable astronomic conditions will only come back a year later. It is also recommended to study the following chapter entirely. Let us return to the communicating vessels. Tw o are full of liquids at different heights; one is yellow and the other one blue. When the communication link balances their levels, the liquids will become green. Identically, if two objects in the same location are charged differently, the result will be, for both, a mixture of their respective energies. Prior to any operation of transfer, the first st age will consist in discharging the objects as much as possible of their latent and paras itic energies so they do not contaminate the energies they will be charged with. This is the case for minerals, for alcohol, and sometimes for the plants. It is best to l eave the object as is, on a little glass or Pyrex saucer, or in a little glass flask without any wrapping in a healthy and dark place. This will protect it from all electric, solar or luna r light. In order to avoid the least bit of contamination, or alteration, the object should not be seen or touched. If the oratory is the isolating shelter, the symbolic object must all the same be protected from the operator each time he will come to meditate. Before a ny session he will lock the object in a small wooden box or envelop it in a fabric that does not conduct electricity and at the end of the session replace it outside of its packaging. The decontamination can last, for example, a lunar cycle at the end of which the object will be definitely protected in its isolati ng case until the required date for charging. The better an object is discharged, the more it becomes sensitive to the energies, both those wished for and the parasitic ones. Some “s ymbolic objects” that naturally contain the energy we are seeking don't have to be discharged. CONDITIONS OF CHARGE Once these precautions have been taken, the actual loading can begin. This essentially concerns the energies of the three “planets ” we insisted on previously: Saturn, the Sun and the Moon. Since the Great Experience concerns the four trees of our being, it is desirable to have some objects “enriched” by the energy of each element: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. We will therefore have twelve symbolic objects: - Four objects will fix the Saturn energy under its aspects: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. - Four objects will fix the Sun energy under its aspects: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth - Four objects will fix the Moon energy under its aspects: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth The favorable astronomical conditions are between June 21 st and June 26 th . They are also good the week before and the week after these tw o dates. It will ther efore be possible to try the Great Experience three times during th ree consecutive weeks and it is desirable to have three sets of these twelve objects, in total 36. During each attempt the set used will have been discharged of the stored energies for our benefit. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity The principle of the energy exchange is consistently used in the following sequences: - Between Nature, whose reserve of energy is full, and oneself, the symbolic object is completely or almost discharged. - Between oneself and the symbolic object, load ed in our presence so that its energy is personalized by our psyche. - Between the symbolic object and oneself at the time of the Experience, the object is discharged to our benefit. - Between Nature and oneself during the Experience, Nature giving us the influx of level 3 or Saturn. It is required one operates alone because of the principle of energy exchange. One exception is when work is performed by a c ouple, Nicolas-Perenelle, in other words the natural man-woman couple in accordance with the structure of Nature. It is necessary that both are on the same esoteric Path. When the energy is fixed in the appropriate conditions, we must maintain its state of purity at a maximum in order to benefit from its influx, which will be a powerful help at the time of the Great Experience. The symbolic objects that are charged will be isolated, for example in a silk fabric. This will preven t all spontaneous discharge of the energy that is now in harmony with the operator. Lack of precaution lessens the quality of the energy or its power of resonance. CHARGING WITH THE FIRE ELEMENT (Tree of Man) The Fire element, energy of the Tree of Man, Secret Fire of the Alchemists or prana of the Orientals, is transferred from the atmo sphere to Earth through rainwater. Hydrogen, the first element manifested in matter, is its support. As long as rainwater has not contacted the earth, we say that the Fire it contains is unspecified, or undetermined . To capture this Fire energy, we will therefore collect rain directly in a glass or Pyrex dish. Do not use a dish made of metallic or cr ystallized matter. These precautions will avoid the presence of a Fire that was determined by contact with a metal or crystal, thereby altering the quality of the energy. As a precau tionary measure, we will operate without delay in order to avoid exposure to sola r, lunar or electric light. There are no disadvantages in stellar radiation. We will immediately fill nine small glass bottles. Since we can try the experience three times, we will have three bottles per planet. The bottle, of a volume of about 10 cc. (a little more than 1/3 fluid ounce), will be preferably closed with ground glass or plastic lids but under no ci rcumstances with metallic ones. They will be wrapped in three groups of three, in a fabric made of silk or plastic which have a strong electrical insulation, and then stored in the oratory. Rainwater collected in this manner does not have to undergo decontamination. The Fire it contains has the nature of the Spirit. It is how ever preferable to collect the rain after it has already fallen abundantly because the dust in suspension in the atmosphere will have been washed down. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The energy fixed in this manner will be used at the time of the Great Experience. CHARGING WITH THE FIRE OF THE SUN - Proceed all year round except, of course, in the days close to the winter solstice when the Fire energies are weakened or occulted by the Sun (Visible) and its electromagnetic aura (Figure 21 ).

CHARGING WITH THE AIR ELEMENT (Animal Tree) Sea salt in its original crystalline form is the support here. On planet Earth it is the bearer of the undetermined animal life. Of hygroscopi c nature, it will also be stored in nine small (i.e. 10 cc) glass bottles, with ground glass or plastic stoppers. Sea salt does not require decontamination either, because this would remove its animal life, and that is precisely what is necessary for our work. The process of enrichment is identical to the one we saw above, charging during the indicated months, days and hours. We will therefore obtain: - Three bottles containing the Air-energy that have been determined by the energy of the Invisible Sun of Saturn. - Three bottles containing the Air-energy that have been determined by the energy of the Invisible Sun of the Sun. - Three bottles containing the Air-energy that have been determined by the energy of the Invisible Sun of the Moon, i.e. the Invisible Earth.

The Mercury of the plant kingdom, alcohol is partic ularly suited to charge with Water-energy, the element of the Plant Tree. - Use a brandy or if no wine alcohol is ava ilable, fruit alcohol at least 80 proof (40%) that will be distributed in the nine usual bottles with stoppers. Here it is mandatory to use transparent glass. - Discharge the alcohol from its parasitic energies by leaving the nine bottles in the oratory. The Alchemy student can always distill wine and dehydrate the alcohol, but only through potassium carbonate (tartar of the Ancients). - After the one lunar cycle necessary to th e discharge, do a maceration of the plants indicated below. Normally these plants do not have to undergo a previous discharge, unless you are not sure of their origin. - Place the plant in the bottle of alcohol. Ev en a small quantity works since it is in resonance with the energy of one of the three levels we aim at and it is essentially a symbolic object. The alcohol must cover the plant. Seal the bottle. - Let it macerate for at least a day. CHARGING WITH THE WATER OF SATURN The three bottles will contain an alcoholic macer ation of a saturnine dried plant: horsetail, cornflower, comfrey, fumitory, seal of Solomon, etc. Exceptionally, for the Water-energy of Saturn, we can operate differently without using alcohol. We use three small chips of diamond that are placed inside each of the three bottles, sealed or not. Due to its natural purity, a diamond does not have to be discharged. A diamond is crystallized carbon - level 3 – the fundamental element of the plant kingdom. Its four electrons are the symbol of the quaternary. The choice of diamond can orient the Experience of Eternity towards its “Experience of the Point” aspect. The actual work of charging will be done in the oratory, after a day or more of maceration, as indicated when charging with the Fire of Saturn. The three bottles will contain the Water-ener gy then determined by the planetary energy of Saturn. CHARGING WITH THE WATER OF THE SUN The three bottles will contain an alcoholic maceration of dried solar plant: eyebright, roman chamomile, celandine, St John's Wort, heliotrope, angelica, etc. As previously and in the same conditions, you can use a crystal instead of plants, here: Orthoclase (a feldspar; moonstone is a variety) . But this crystal will have previously been discharged as indicated. The actual charging work will be done as in th e phase indicated for charging with the Fire of the Sun. It is preferable here to operate in the days close to the winter solstice (Figure © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity 21 ) because the Invisible Sun, bearer of the Fire-Air energies, is occulted by the Sun (Visible) at this time of year on Earth. The three bottles will contain the Water-ener gy then determined by the planetary energy of the Sun (Visible). CHARGING WITH THE WATER OF THE MOON The three bottles will contain an alcoholic maceration of dried lunar plant: cultivated lettuce, watercress, cucumber, pilosella ( Hieracium pilosella, mouse ear hawkweed ), veronica, etc. Here, no crystal is recommended. The actual charging work will be done as indi cated for the charging of the Fire of the Moon, but preferably when the moon is close to its perigee. The three bottles will contain the Water energy then determined by the planetary energy of the Moon. CHARGING WITH THE EARTH ELEMENT (Mineral tree) The supports are here crystals that we can find easily in “rock and mineral” shops. They will all be discharged. If this discharge st rongly weakens the parasitic energies, it does not affect the energies of resonance of the crystal. CHARGING WITH THE EARTH OF SATURN The three bottles for the Earth of Saturn will contain galena or cubic iron pyrites. Galena is a lead sulphide, metal of Saturn, associ ated with sulphur, symbol of the spiritual animation of the elements in Alchemy. A nicely crystallized galena will be preferred. The work of charging in the oratory will be done similarly to the phase for the charge of the Fire of Saturn. The three bottles will then contain the Earth-energy determined by the planetary energy of Saturn. CHARGING WITH THE EARTH OF THE SUN The three bottles of the Earth of the Sun can c ontain some crystals of: realgar, malachite, wolframite, gypsum, or orthoclase (although alrea dy used for the Water of the Sun). It is preferable to have a nugget of native gold th at must be discharged because we do not know how it was handled before its purchase. The work in the oratory will be performed similarly to charging with the Fire of the Sun. Here we also prefer the timeframe near the Winter Solstice. The three bottles will then contain the Earth-energy determined by the planetary energy of the Sun (Visible). © Triad Publishing, 2007.

It is preferred to have a nugget of native silver that will also be discharged. The work in the oratory is done similarly to the Fire of the Moon phase, but preferably when the moon is closest to its perigee. The three bottles will then contain the Earth-energy determined by the planetary energy of the Moon. IN CASE OF DIFFICULTY There exists a certain amount of flexibility in the annual calendar to execute the different chargings. There is less flexibility when we d eal with the indicated planetary hours. For students who cannot operate on the first hour of the planetary ruler, it is possible to work during following “hours” of the planetary ruler of the day (Figure 17 ): - For the Fire energy: 8 th hour of the day - Fir the Air energy: 3 rd hour of the night - For the Water energy: 10 th hour of the night - For the Earth energy, the only possibility is the 10 th hour of the night These hourly possibilities are of course identical for the three planets. Concerning the symbolic objects to charge w ith the Water element, you can also utilize fresh plants. If the use of alcoholic macera tion is a problem for you, you can solve this by placing the dried plant alone in the bottle. These compromises are justified because they always remain in symbolic resonance with the level of energy. They however do not o ffer the quality of the methods described above. For a better understanding of the operations i ndicated above, here is a summary of the different stages concerned: Discharging Symbolic Objects - Preferably in the oratory, - Object without insulating protection, - Glass or Pyrex dish, transparent glass bottles, - Length of time: one moon cycle, - Insulating protection during exercises in the oratory, - Complete protection at the end of the lunar month, - Not necessary for rain water, sea salt and plants.

FIXATION OF THE ENERGY Planet SATURN  SUN  MOON  Day of charge Saturday Sunday  Monday  Support of the element: Element • Fire • Air • Water • Earth  Rain water Sea salt  Plant + wine alcohol or diamond chip Crystal Rain water  Sea salt Plant + wine alcohol or crystal Crystal  or native gold nugget   Rain water Sea salt  Plant + wine alcohol Crystal or native silver nugget The distribution of energies on Earth is done by the sun (V.S.), Earth and Water, and by the invisible sun (I.S.), Fire and Air. We must be particularly watchful with the enrichment of the symbolic objects with the Fi re and Air energies that are the energies essentially at work in human magnetism and because the impact on the Spirit-Energy will be important in our Experience. The enrich ment with Earth and Water energies has a weaker reaction on our physical body (Matter-Energy), which is more attuned to Earth magnetism. Science considers only electromagnetism, or the phenomenon bound to magnets or ordinary electric currents. Science does not study much of what we call human magnetism. However, to all those that try to understand the reality of Man, it is obvious that there is a subtle link between these tw o kinds of magnetism. All those that have worked with electricity know its unpleasant action on the body of man. Human electricity © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Th is common result from the two electricities, here muscular contraction, similar to the result of the two magnetisms (though less evident in the second case), is explained by the link between those two energies: the Spirit-Energy and the Matter-Energy, both belonging to the same energetic level. In summary, we have: Inner Energy - human magnetism - human electricity Physical Energy - ground magnetism - ordinary electricity Concerning the meditations that come with th is work, each one will proceed according to their own inner resonance. Please remember to reach mental calm to be able to listen to the little inner voice. During these meditations , we indicated to light a single candle, symbol of Unity, for the following three plan ets: Saturn, Sun and Moon. This is due to the fact that during the charge, we tend to fi x the Primordial Energy so that it is given back at the time of the Great Experience (E xperience of Eternity) in order to ease the Contact belonging to the Unitary Level. These operations of fixing the energy are not difficult. They only require some attention. These mark the end of the preparation for th e Great Experience. They will be followed by another preparation, the inner preparation that we will now study. Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

For reasons of convenien ce, alchemical language and symbols were used in order to grasp the properties of the energy (Figure 2 ). We also used the symbolism of Qabala and specifically the Tr ee to grasp the structures. However, we sometimes have referred to the Tree of the Sephiroth (Figure 4 ) but did not make it an object of study, strictly speaking, because this was already done in our course on Qabala. The Tree of the Sephiroth has been referenced as it appears on Figure 4 . We prefer, from this treatise forward, the modified represen tation of the top of the Tree as shown on Figure 27 and on the cover page, where the places of the planets have been retained. This tree is the support structure for our meditati ons in the oratory. We do not renounce the classical Tree as a whole, but it seems to us that the drawing proposed here is more in conformity with the present day structure of the Return in the Tree of Man. This Tree of the Return is the evolutionary Tree of Qabala . We named it “The New Tree”. We believe it is better adapted to our work and we thi nk that the symbolic harmony that comes from it has a more important initiatic power than the traditional Tree, particularly in our present day when the passage of the Nadir ha s started. By taking the time to discover this New Tree we will better immerse ourselves in it for the meditations linked to the Great Experience. THE TOP OF THE TREE In the chapter of the Creation it was stated that the first three levels 1 , 2 and 3 do not have a real existence in Unity. Rather these are three different perceptions of Unity from our earthly human consciousness. Qabala considers that there are three levels in the world of Eternity. Our experiences show us that in this Unitary world there is but Unity in Eternity. The perception of three levels in th at part of the Universe comes only from the three different ways our consciousness contacts It. Christianity, confronted with the inner experi ences of its mystics, imagined only one God in three people to interpret the perception of these three contacts. If we are successful in our Great Experience, we will also have the revelation that levels 1, 2 and 3 are only One and that this triple aspect is the only possible interpretation for man back on level 10 after this Contact. The modification brought to th e drawing of the Tree, far from being a misinterpretation, will be an aid, or better, a support adapted to the meditations of the Experience. In our representation, we stopped the lateral columns of the Tree on the boundary Duality -Unity; these columns not exist in Unity. Their prolongation in two rejoining arcs symbolizes the fusion of the two aspects of the energy upon return in Unity.

In Unity, the fusion of the energies is symbolized by the circle with the point, level 1 , which is probably the best symbol of the Contact with Eternity. The ci rcle underneath divided by the vertical line, level 2 , symbolizes the experience of Eternity where our consciousness separates the vibrations of the Universe in space-time. The circle including the triangle, level 3 , symbolizes the passage of the infinite, the circ le, to the finite, the triangle, and vice versa. It is therefore these three functions that can be perceived in the Contact of Eternity. Saturn placed in the center of the lintel of our New Tree presides over the destiny of Duality. In the traditional Tree of Qabala (Figure 4) the energy penetrates in duality by the left pillar, in other words by the Sephirah of Saturn. It is from there that the symbols of the Black Virgin come. In fact, the virgin is the matter that has not yet been used; and she is black because she penetrates in the da rk worlds of Duality. In the New Tree, the energy also enters through level 3 of Saturn now located on the middle pillar, which gives a character of symmetry to the energy that will enter in the two lateral pillars. It is on the Saturn level that time and space appear. THE BODY OF THE TREE The “New Tree”, because it bears the dynamics of the Return, is this inner support for our meditations. Figure 28 is the specific support of the work in the process of the Great Experience. The structure of the New Tree is kept. Thr ee new symbols appear on the middle path 3-6-9 , also on the level of our planets of reference: Saturn-Sun-Moon. On level 3 - Saturn, we are at the limit Infinite-finite and also Eternity-space-time. It is on this level that the contact of the Great Experience happens. We know that mythology indicates that Saturn-Chronos is the creator of time and that he devours his children. All that belongs to the realm of time disappears in the return to Eternity, except for the awakening of Consciousness. The symbol we chose is the double hourglass. The hourglass is the symbol of time: vertical and time flows; horizontal and time is suspended. Due to the strong symbolic value of the hourglass, we previously recommended to have one in the oratory. When we are away from the oratory, or when we will try the contact on Eternity, the hourglass must be in th e horizontal position, sign of the infinite ∞ . There time does not flow. Time flows when we do an active work, for instance when we charge symbolic objects with the Elements. The hourgl ass must be vertical, figuratively the 8, symbol of the double quaternary. On level 6 - Sun, the hexagram is traced. Here the triangle of the Spirit has now overcome the triangle of Matter, resulting from the work of man. At the center of this hexagram the Sun is represented. It is also the inner Sun. Here are the Key and the Lock to the door of the Temple of Man. Not repr esented, they are located on the Tree where both the psychic heart and the voice of our Eter nal Self resonate. In Alchemy this center is opened with the Philosopher’s Stone, calle d the “Red Stone”. In Qabala, we remind © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This cardiac center, the Upper Self, manifests itself when the self of the Earth has accomplished all the preparatory work necessary for this act. On Figure 28, level 6 can be covered with a speck of gold, preferably native gold, that radiates the energies of this level. On level 9 - Moon, the receiving cup of the Grail is represented, held by the waxing and waning moons of the lunar cycle. In 10 , the symbol of the Earth is also that of antimony, a metal with the singular property of allowing the transfer of energies between level 10 and 9 and also between 9 and 10 . If we meditate on the symbolism of this Ne w Tree, a central column in us is created which will be the Path of the energies in our Experience. Through the middle pillar the energy of Saturn, Level 3, is transmitted to the Sun, Level 6 , Key of the Door to the Temple. Through the opening of this Door the energies of Knowledge are transmitted to the Moon, Level 9 . In turn the Moon distributes these to level 10 of Earth. This is therefore the path towards Unity. If the Descent in Duality requires a series of imbalances, the Return towards Eternity ha ppens only through a constant research of balance on the Middle Path. This is one of the reasons of the change to the Tree of Qabala (Figure 4 ) so that we can attempt to contact Unity, or Eternity. We gave the name of PORTAE LUCIS to the symbol of the New Tree. It means: DOOR OF THE LIGHT. We hope that the meditation on this symbol will open wide for you this Door already half-opened. It symbolizes th e assurance of a greater opening, the opening of the Door of the Temple that undoubtedly leads to the Light of the Invisible Worlds.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This is different from the path used by the energy of the Descen t that takes the successive levels. This is the direct path of Illumination. In Qabala, path 3-6-9 is called the Pillar of Balance and also the Path of the Arrow. Facing the New Tr ee, we will have to meditate on those three important levels: Saturn, Sun and Moon. This last sphere has an action of equal importance as the other two but is more comp lex because of the cereb ral transfer of the results of the Experience. To facilitate the meditation at these levels , it is good to have a point of support which function can moreover be both a springboard a nd a place of pause according to the inner activity we want to lead. That point of suppor t will be a mental construction we will learn to erect and which will give us a great stability as well as continuity in our life in the Invisible. In the first part of this treatise, we expl ained that Self-Consciousness was not completed in Man (Figure 11 ). We have also said that all solid construction belongs to the mineral kingdom. Our mental constructions will therefor e be placed in the levels of the mineral tree, on the side of the Return. All those th at will do these experiences of construction have necessarily successfully passed through th e Initiation of the Nadi r. For any of the four Trees this is a necessary condition for all constructions in the Return. During the meditations, a small piece of galena, level 3 , can be placed in the oratory. This mineral symbol will have only this function and will be not be one of those used in the series of symbolic objects. MENTAL CONSTRUCTION The mental energy emitted on our level is “the matter-energy” of level 9 ; the mental- energy emitted from 9 is “the matter-energy” of level 8 , etc. When we think we create some thought-forms on level 9 . These thoughts-forms subsist some time then they dissolve naturally little by little. If, by magic, or more simply if by repetition each day, we generate the same thought, then we use our creative power. The thought-form thickens, is crystallized and is fixed in 9 where it has a body. It can even provoke manifestations in 10 especially if it has been concei ved for that purpose. For example when we devise a plan before its reali zation, here is how we operate: mentally, repeatedly, we modify it, perfect it, and ad apt it to its environment. When it seems in conformity with our aim, we start its unde rtaking rather easily even though it still needs work on the material plane. The more a plan is refined in our mental, the easier its realization is facilitated. That process works regardless of the motivation of the person that uses it and whatever © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The emission of thoughts, whether c onstructive or not, take strength as long as they are sustained. This is why, when we wa nt to free ourselves from the nuisance of others, we must be capable of raising our ow n thoughts to a level higher than that of these persons. This always implies a personal work from the heart. This quality must not let us disregard the laws that animate our world of 10 , laws necessary to the realization of the laws of above. It is said: “if we have our head in the sky our feet must remain on earth”. In religious groups in particular, collectiv e meditation and prayer create thought-forms. Considering the continuous work and the num ber of participants, the thought-form can approach the density of 10 . The most sentient people, most often children, can be witnesses to phenomenon or apparitions specifi c to the religion practiced. When one of the members dies his consciousness awakens in 9 and he perceives the thought-forms of his group transmitted to this level. For certa in time he is comforted, facing the familiar world of his religion. Then, progressively fr eeing himself from the first stage of this level, he will have access to the highest parts. He then discovers that the reality of the inner spaces expands well beyond the religious structures established in 10 . If we belong to a meditation group in which me mbers are asked, for example, to regularly visualize a same place of meeting to do a speci fic work, it is prudent to try and find out who benefits from this mental creation and what are its applications and consequences. The sole aim of several leaders of these groups is the restriction of individual liberty and the proliferation of financial goods for their own profit. It is preferable that we construct our own dwellings to withdraw within when we navigate in other space-times. Consequently it will be a personal construction and no longer a collective one. For the Great Experience, three mansions will be useful. CONSTRUCTION OF THE CASTLES We will begin the construction of our invisibl e mansions, these dwellings called “castles” in esotericism regardless of their exterior aspect. Place yourself facing the New Tree or visualize it. (Figure 27) CASTLE OF THE MOON On level 9 , it is suitable to visualize a tall building, of humble appearance, surrounded with water and dominated by a grey sky. In this “castle”, we will visualize a huge library with an armchair where we will come to s it down. We are in the castle of the transfer from the heart to the brain of the earth, in other words a transfer of the knowledge obtained through our heart. These visualizations will mainly be done on Monday during the hours of the lunar energies. CASTLE OF THE SUN On level 6 , we will visualize a castle as harm onious as possible, with tall windows opening on a park and a luminous blue sky. This castle will have two rooms, one being a great hall of reception with an armchair w ith an ornate back having a gold colored hexagram and a radiant golden sun in the cente r. It is in this place we occupy that the energy emanating from the levels above will come to us, in particular from level 3 . The © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity other room that we are already familiar with is the classroom with benches, board, platform and desk. In this place, as we alr eady said, the Inner Master will address us and this is where we receive true esoteric teaching, the Knowledge. We can take the Versailles castle as a model. It is the castle of the Sun King, King Louis XIV, 2 times 7, the king of the double duality. The Hall of Mirrors is the symbol of the cosmic mirror that comes with us in this castle. The mental construction of this castle will be done preferably Sunday during the hours of the solar energies. CASTLE OF SATURN On the Saturn level, in 3 , we mentally build a pyramid. It helps to use a visible model; the crystalline lattice of sea salt made of little st acked cubes is excellent. Visualize the All Seeing Eye, either on one of its faces, or on top of the pyramid on a capstone. Plan an entry like in the Great Pyramid of Egypt. In side is an armchair where you will sit down. Practice this work on Saturday during the hours of the Saturn energies. MEDITATION The technique of construction of the mansion of level 9 can theoretically seem easy since it follows our usual thought process. It is le ss true for the constructions to be made on levels 6 and 3 . As long as we do not yet have contact with levels beyond 9 it is not very easy to transfer our thoughts from one level to the other to raise ourselves to the plane where we want to operate. We will therefore need to place ourselves facing the New Tree and focus our attention on level 6 . Visualizing it, we will try to inwardly fix it with all its properties, in particular the heart corresponde nce. Then, we must begin the construction of the castle. Regular repetitions bring consis tency to our mind, its image becoming more familiar after each new work session. These imbibitions will allow us to approach the level gradually. We will proceed in the same way for level 3 . This practice is also good for level 9 even if it is more accessible. These sessions are associated with a work of personal meditation. After each session of mental construction, our attitude will be passive and attentive. These dwellings will become places where it w ill be possible to rest and where we can say that there we “are meditated”. These mansions can also serve as a refuge during dreams when we are in danger. If, close to one of these three places, we are in possession of a vehicle, even a modern car, we must be aw are that this is a vehicle of transfer of our acquisitions and knowledge, and care must be taken at the time of possible loading of “luggage”. Consequently, we must be very a ttentive to the symbolic language that we will find there. These invisible dwellings w ill be precious after the Great Experience, when we can be propelled consciously into one of them, or even successively in the three, an experience we wish for each of you. Traini ng to be attentive in meditation is both passive-active and will facilitate listening to the Upper Self to whom we cannot give orders. It is good to begin these meditations as soon as possible because it is desirable to be able to move inside these space-times and use our heart to be the privileged actor. This work, particularly beneficial during the Great Experience, can be continued after this period.  Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

With the progression of the pr eparations towards this Experience, it is understood that it is not a supra-natural act but a succession of acts that are based on the laws of the nature. The purpose aimed at is a result quite different from that of daily life. Starting the preliminary works as soon as possi ble gives a certain comfort since the actual loading work takes at least three weeks when the required conditions are present. If this preparatory work can be spread over severa l months, the time of the Great Experience cannot extend past mid-July. This is the lim it of the unique astronomical position of our planet in relation to the Invisible Sun of Saturn. The 2 nd week of the Experience is very close to June 21 st , summer solstice, and June 26 th , when the spiritual energies of the Sun and Saturn are at their maximum of intensity. We are now ready: we could refine our i nner perception by our study and our meditations and have begun to be in resonance with the New Tree and practiced the construction our invisible mansions. We also strived to be in the best physical and psychic health. When the time comes we will be rein forced with the energy stored in the symbolic objects in our possession. Before we start, we will need to immerse ourselves with the behavior required in the oratory. Use Figure 28 during all that Week. BEGINNING OF THE HOLY WEEK In nature, any conception unfolds in the dark until birth. Similarly our preparation to the Great Experience will be done at night. This will be the night from Friday to Saturday that corresponds to Good Friday because the birth of our Divine Child, the first contact between our true Self of Eternity and our sma ll self of the Earth, is prepared in the night from Friday to Saturday.

THE REMAINDER OF THE HOLY WEEK The other experiences proposed during the Holy Week are useful but less important. Their aim is to help neutralize the possi ble loss of energy for people who have not sufficiently loaded the symbolic objects. They should also help the manifestation of the influx received and regulate in us the physi cal and psychic energies. This energetic reinforcement allows to better benefit from the results of the Experience. Some symbolic objects are indicated. They will have been discharged as already explained. They will be charged according to th e phases previously described, in the first hour of the planetary ruler’s energy of the da y.

In order for you not to wait a full y ear to try the Experience in the conditions mentioned above, you can follow another method explained hereunder. Use the New Tree illustrated on Figure 28. Level 6 , cardiac center, can be covered with a piece of gold, preferably a native gold nugget that radiates the energies of this level. Level 9 , lunar level, represents the receptive cup of the Grail held by the waxing and waning Moon of the lunar cycle.

This spontaneous contact is the natural fruit of the student’s work or of the work from a previous lifetime. When the Contact happens the body is often tired or sick. A special physical state often precedes the spontaneous Experience. This begins on Friday at the end of day. One feels an extreme unjustified fatigue. There are no symptoms of illness, fever or abnormal blood pressure. We have a powerful fatigue against which we can do nothing but also the intuition that nothing shoul d be done about it. The week is laborious. It is better not to take drugs, remedies or alcohol and to eat lightly. The recovery is miraculous and happens in a few minutes. Ou r energy then reaches levels previously unknown to us. The contact of Eternity occurs in the hours that follow, generally the night from Friday to Saturday. If you can do so, it is good to withdraw afterwards for a “week in the desert”. INDUCED EXPERIENCE This is the Experience we talked about previously in the beginning of the Holy Week. With knowledge, during the week, we can regulate the effects that could sometimes be dazzling. In this contact of level 3 the vibratory rate is extremely powerful. Our consciousness is propelled simultaneously in an extension of time and in an extension of space that are equivalent to the entire Universe. At that instant, the being is the Universe. He has immediate understanding. In the state of omniscience in which he lives, or, more accurately, he vibrates, he knows his past, his present and his becoming. Consequently, he has the knowledge of the Path already trav eled and the one that he still has to walk. When we live this state, one advantage is that it gives us the certainty of the immortality of the Being. This experience is often named “Experience of the Point” because we have the sensation of being a “Point” that pulses like a respir ation. Each vibration pulsed by the Being’s Will manifests instantly. In this contact, Know ledge, and its inherent Powers are the same as those of the being of the Origin, those of the Original Human Seed in its Beginning. But the difference here is that in the Beginni ng, the being is self-unconscious and that in the Return, the being is self-conscious. This Self-Consciousness gives access to knowledge not accessible from other space-times and of course not from our level 10 . It is obvious that the Experience on this level concerns only Man in the Return phase. © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity THE RETURN This contact is by definition punctual, and the return to the level of consciousness of the Earth is mandatory. It can happen in two ways: either almost instantaneously, or progressively. In the first case, the extensi ons of consciousness disappear as rapidly as the “return” itself. At that moment, we have a strange feeling: we remember that we understood everything, that we knew everythi ng, and we realize we now know nothing or merely nothing any longer. However, afte r each renewed Contact, an element of knowledge remains. It is only after a rather l ong series of Contacts that we can begin to glimpse the structures of Man, the Universe, and the place that we hold. In the second case, the return occurs progr essively. It is like a kind of slow and continuous fall without sensation of stopping. Ho wever, the passage from one level to the other translates as a phenomenon similar to the succession of days and nights on Earth. In other words, the light appears and goes thr ough a maximum of intensity, weakens until is imperceptible and then reappears. This “re- descent” through the denser invisible worlds is comparable to a plunge in a black well, the bottom of which opens on another well, another world, less luminous than the preceding one, and so on, down to level of the Earth. It is useful here to refer back to Figure 8 . The undulating curve on the right that represents the series of resonance of the energies with the crystals represents, analogically, the succession of the luminous per ceptions of the different invisible worlds in the Descent like in the Return. Therefor e the experience of return from the Great Experience shows that the invisible worlds, th e levels of consciousness, are not separated by walls. Each world or space-time is a point of resonance of the energy separated from the other by a point of non-resonance. It is weakly energetic and appears less luminous, even dark. When the Great Experience happens for the first time, there is an effect of surprise such that it hinders the harvesting of even the sma llest element of information concerning this passage of the invisible worlds. On the other hand, the repetition of this Experience makes this “return” familiar and a more preci se knowledge of the different space-times is progressively produced. We know that knowi ng is power through the very knowledge of the laws of Nature. If after the experience we are crushed by space-time, it is smart to go to the Saturn shelter. The sensation of th is heavy burden slowly disappears and we are left with a strange sensation, a type of exch ange in our consciousness. If after Sunday, the Universal Love makes it difficult for you to w ithstand the problems of this world, go to the shelter of the Sun. If you have a problem of knowledge, go to th e shelter of the Moon. If the Contact has not been conscious duri ng the Experience, it will necessarily occur after a certain time: we will ha ve to be attentive to the least unusual indication happening inwardly or in the exterior life. These clue s which we can receive during our dreams, or in changes solving our problems of daily life, are very precious. Those who failed to note the clues in due time gradually and unconscious ly lost the benefits of the Contact of Eternity because they ignored the tools of utilization. We will now continue our study with the different ways of getting a benefit from our Harvest.   Ora et Labora © Triad Publishing, 2007.

We must not lose that “almost nothing”; it is important. From this experience we will re build our puzzle to regain Knowledge. After every new contact in one of th e invisible worlds, a different “almost nothing” will remain that will add to the previous one allowing us to gradually recover in 10 a great part of the Revealed Knowledge. The Contact of level 3 is quite real, and because we have lived it several times we know that it will be the same for many others. Those that tried the Great Experience and have not had consciousness of the contact should not believe that they were excluded from the Esoteric Path. In all the preparatory work, like in the very work of the E xperience they accomplished, they undoubtedly modified their inner structures. The use of the symbolic loaded objects has partly rebalanced the energies of the four elements, of which we are all bearers; additionally this happened mainly on the three importa nt levels of the tree of Man: 3, 6 and 9 , that underline and are the backbone of the Path of Illumination. It is true that such a result, as long as it remains unconscious, can seem to be a very small satisfaction compared to one who has conscious ly lived the Experience of the Point. An analogy would be the difference between one who remembered his dream regularly and those that, though sleeping normally, do not remember them. They dream but are deprived of the dreamlike information that concer ns them. If they want to benefit from it, they will have to become attentive to the least “almost nothing” when returning to an awakened state. Here also, methods of work ex ist that allow the sleeper to bring back the contents of his dreams. The deciphering work will still have to be done. If the Great Experience and the work it requires do not immediately give us the contact of level 3 , at least they do speed up its approach. We can stimulate this approach so we do not lose the energies involved. From the work performed aiming at the Experi ence of the Point, our purpose is to give the elements and the methods that allow fo r the construction of our personal revelation. Several processes of contact are proposed to sustain this work, each one of us choosing the method that suits him best or resonates in him. The practice is not reduced to a simple technical exercise but is always associated with a continuous work on ourselves. THE CONTACT What do we mean by “contact” in esotericism? We mean the same thing as in common language: the fact of entering in relation with a thing to the point of touching it, or feeling what emanates from it. We have in our spiritual quest the same understanding, but on a © Triad Publishing, 2007.

This rapport to the “thing”, ev en when it becomes almost physical, becomes dominant, especially through the inner resonance it triggers. We are “touched” by the event. We have all lived, at different moment s of our existence, contacts, states that would be likened to a kind of transcendence e ither towards a person, or towards nature or art. When we simply have the intuition of something, of some event, we are in a beginning of contact. This phenomenon sometimes occurs when we dream. Some dream content is still with us when we awaken and sometimes 24 or 48 hours later we are still all impregnated with it. This type of dream has moved something in us; something like an opening has occurred. It is an aspiration toward s something that extricates us from the purely physical state, a reframing towards our Becoming. On a more subtle level, true contact give s access to information based on laws that we were not conscious of until then. It is a bit like a breath of air; placing us on a springboard, it propels us to develop our poten tial and our possibility of action. Each of us will of course have our own definition, by virtue of our own experiences. We are interested in the means that exist to enhan ce these contacts since they will progressively lead to the conscious relation between the little king and the Great King that animate us, or between the visible and the invisible of which we are part. These contacts will accelerate the trigger effect of the Great Expe rience. That is why we will study a certain number of processes that we deem relevant. CONTACTS GIVEN BY THE DOUBLE PLANETARY INFLUX Let’s refer to Figure 17. The table indicates the action of certain planetary energies at selected hours. Our interest will be drawn to wards the action of th e energy of the ruling planet of the day compounded with the energy of a specific planet. Their combined influx will enhance the contacts we are looking for through our inner work. The meditation during these “planetary hours” appears different from that of the Holy Week. Is is destined to those who after having the Great Experience found themselves in a “sensitive” state. This could allow them to be in resonance with the energies corresponding to that state and to reinforce this beginning of contact. Saturday The 4 th hour of the day facilitates the Saturn-Sun contact. The influx of Universal Love of Saturn is demonstrated more easily under th e cardiac love (also called “Christic” in the traditions), this love descending in us. The 7 th hour of the day that facilitates the Saturn-Moon contact continues to the 8 th hour. This contact of Eternity is grasped through th e intellect since the level of the Moon is the cerebral transmitter. Sunday The 3 rd and 10 th hours of the day that facilitate the Sun-Mercury contact are favorable to an invisible-visible contact.

Mercury-Moon is here under the rulership of the Sun. It accentuates the Sun-Moon transfer, under the influence of Mercury, the messenger of the Gods. Monday The 2 nd and 9 th hours of the days that facilitate the Moon-Saturn contact are favorable to bringing the inner results to our awareness. The 5 th and 12 th hours of the day that facilitate the Moon-Sun contact are favorable to an influx of cardiac or Christic love. Here, the small self strives to reach this love by reaching towards the Inner Self. Tuesday Prudence is required in handling the somewhat authoritative energy of Mars and no special contact is recommended. Wednesday The 2 nd and 9 th hours of the day that facilitate the Mercury-Moon contact are favorable to a contact between the invisible and visible worlds. We again find the Mercury-Moon transfer of Sunday but here, the energy of Mercury being the planetary ruler of the day, the transfer is much more powerful. Wednesday, more than any other day, is when the “telephone line” is best connected between the invisible worlds and ours. Thursday The 6 th day hour that facilitates the Jupiter-Moon c ontact is favorable to the revelation of esoteric knowledge. Additionally it helps the problems of assimilation, both physiological and cerebral. Friday The 7 th day hour that facilitates the Venus-Sun contact continues in the 8 th hour, favoring the feelings of earthly love and friendship. If you can it is exceptionally beneficial to meditate during the night hours, from the 3 rd to the 7 th inclusive. Students will find themselves consolidated by the night material energies in view of a possible trigger, or re-trigger, of the Great Experience. All these contacts concerning the influx of two planetary energies are not to be tried each day. They can be done only if the student d eems it necessary, in answer to a specific point he is working on. Their aim is to grow the seed that germinated as a result of the Great Experience. Let’s suppose that after th e Great Experience we feel sensitized or challenged by a problem concerning the co mprehension of the functioning of the Universe. It will then be appropriate to try the contact on Thursday on the 6 th day hour. Let’s also suppose that in the uneasy period that follows the Great Experience you had a dream or a foray in the invisible that you don’t remember well.

Each will try to grasp the understanding to his question. It is obvious that the “sensitive” periods can occur well beyond the unfolding of the Great Experience accordi ng to our own path. And these beginning contacts remain valid. CONTACTS GENERATED DURING THE HOUR OF THE PLANETARY RULER See Figures 17 and 27. We indicated a certain number of properties pe rtaining to each level for the contacts that were described and proposed in the course of the Holy Week. Whether the contacts are provoked or spontaneous, it is then useful to recognize these properties in order to identify the stage reached on our Path. It is also useful to remember that the laws of each level have power on the laws of the inferior levels. At the time of contact of a specific level, the consciousness of the Earth can transfer there its will to act. It can then ac tivate the laws of this very level that react successively on the levels under it down to the 10 th . We do want to warn you by confirming that if each law of a given level has a possibility of action, it also has the possibility of action of its contrary, such as illustrated by the practices of black magic and white magic. Th e visible, like the invisible, up to level 3 belongs to the world of duality. Each the levels have their privileged domain of knowledge, which are described below. Level 3 This is the most complex level to grasp in Creation. We will forsake here the part of level 3 relative to Unity in order to focus on the part relative to Duality. It is the level where Creation manifests itself. It is there that the energy takes its Matter-Spirit, time-space aspect. This is why we have placed that point at the top of Duality on the New Tree, the object of meditation of the Great Experience. The contacts of consciousness on this level are not much different from the contact of Eternity. The extension of consciousness in time and in space is immense and just a little “below” the limit of Eternity. The resulting phenomenon is similar to the one of the Great Experience. In other words, during the return of consciousness to level 10 , the loss of memory is considerable and we bring back down here only a very small part of what had been perceived. However the appreciable difference is that on level 3 “Duality side”, the contact can be produced from one of the Trees. This is often the Matter or Mineral Tree in the beginning, probably because it is at the origin of the expansion of consciousness. It is recommended to try the contact on Satu rday morning at sunrise. One should not attempt it during the three weeks before and af ter the winter solstice where the Fire and Air influences of Saturn are weak. During the meditation, base your visualization on the following: in the New Tree, instead of th e hourglass, place inside the triangle of 3 the all Seeing Eye and create three currents of energy that will each be directed towards levels 4, 5 and 6 in order to start the descent of the energies towards the terrestrial consciousness. As long as we are incarnated, even if we have access to a high level, the transmission comes through all the intermediate levels down to the 10 th . When during the Great Experience we work on path 3-6-9 we reinforce the path of the energy on this trajectory. Although with less power, the energy animates nonetheless levels 4-5-7 and 8 down to © Triad Publishing, 2007.

Level 4 Although not placed on the direct path of the energy 3-6-9, its position at the top of column 4-7 must help us with the awakening of the heart in 6 , center of the Tree. This peak of knowledge in Duality of the invisi ble manifested world has a double aspect: one is the spiritual wealth and the other is the material wealth. In the 1 st hour of the planetary ruler on Thursday, the meditation will facilitate our access to knowledge, particularly with the spiritual knowledge of the Universe. In the 2 nd hour of the planetary ruler, the med itation will provoke a contact of a more precise character concerning the knowledge of the laws of the Universe. The 3 rd and the 4 th hours of the planetary ruler will be favorable to the material wealth in life and to a material help for the spiritual work. For example, one may have difficulty performing during the hours of meditation or having an oratory. Level 5 Its position on top of column 5-8 gives it a powerful action. The top of the creative energies in Duality of the manifested i nvisible world is the arm that commands the elements. We must therefore be very prudent in the med itations on this level; the forces triggered at the time of a contact can be brutal. The med itations can drive to energetic and painful purifications. It would be wise to give them an essentially passive character. - At the 1 st and 2 nd hours of the planetary ruler of Tuesday, contemplation on the spiritual energy (Fire, Air). - At the 3 rd and 4 th hours of the planetary ruler, contemplation on the physical energy (Water, Earth) and particularly on the circulation of the blood. Level 6 This is the level of the Inner Self. The meditations towards the contact in 6 are useful only to those that have not yet had the cont act with the School of the Night. As soon as this happens, we must acknowledge that His advice trumps all others. The meditations will be done Sunday at the hour of the planetary ruler, where normally there is only harmony, balance and beauty. Th e two hours of the planetary ruler concern the spiritual aspect of the energy. The last two hours of the planetary ruler concern its material aspect, in particular the quality of the blood (Grail). During the meditations, visualize the all-seeing eye as indicated above for level 3 . Visualize it very close to you, a little in front of the top of the head. For the meditations on level 6 , point of convergence of all the energies (Figure 5), it is good to have a nugget of native gold or live gold in the oratory. Level 7 Contacts on this level often take place in the Plant Tree, Water Element, both symbols of the Primordial Waters and of the water of c onception that ensures th e continuation of life.

Except upon advice from the Inner Master, never touch this problem between two incarnations, not even during this incarnation. The meditations will take place on Friday at th e hours of the planetary ruler. The contact of this level that binds paths 6-7 allows us to acquire the continuity of consciousness through incarnations and therefore to obtain th e “reading” on the obstacles of the present Path. Level 8 Since this level is accessible to very few pe ople, the mental constructions there are not very polluted by the erroneous or negative thought s of incarnated beings. This is the level of the beginning of authority on the elements. At night, when sleeping, we have miscellane ous contacts. However if the transmission does not happen, they remain in the unconscious. The aim of this meditation is to activate the role of Mercury, the messenger between the invisible and the visible, because without his action the transmission does not happen. On the other hand, the action of Mercury could free the consciousness of 10 in awakened dreams wher e the action of the two consciousnesses is possible. The other contribution of the contacts on this leve l is to guide us in the choice of the Path that best fits our Return. As long as we ar e incarnated, even if we have access to a high level, the transmission occurs through all the intermediate levels that are useful. The meditations will take place on Wednesday at the hours of the planetary ruler and in the evening right before going to sleep, considering the role of Mercury. Level 9 This is the level of the Moon where the thought -forms of all the bei ngs of the Earth are created, most unconsciously. The thought-forms perceived during contacts are in general improperly controlled and loaded with negativit y. This is why one can say that this first level of contact is a world of illusions for many people because it’s “reading’ is incomplete and even deceitful. This explains why many written texts on this subject are largely erroneous. The faulty Invisible-brain transmission is a handicap on the Path of Return, so the meditations on this level will consist especia lly in making this plane as transparent as possible. They will be practiced on Monday at the hours of the planetary ruler. Although the properties of the levels have been described in the order 3 to 9 or Saturday to Monday, that does not imply that you should also practice the meditations in that order. This is only a convenient presentation and not an approach of descent of the energies as in Qabalistic practice. The aim here is to try the contact of a particular level that we wish reinforced, always with the consolidation of column 3-6-9 in mind. THE DREAMS When we tried to define the contact, we a lluded to dreams. The dream is the expression of the unconscious during sleep. It carries information from the different interior levels towards the conscious. To favor this harvesting, we must prepare the ground so that the © Triad Publishing, 2007.

It is therefore good to prepare to sleep at night: relaxation, empty mental state, spiritual construction, etc. Upon waking, even before m oving, we should remain vigilant for a few seconds to the state we are in and then not e our impressions. Gradually, out of the night, the nebula will clear up and nocturnal informa tion will become fixed. We can then begin to write down our dreams and meditate on their contents. For those that have never done this practice, we suggest keeping a notebook that will be divided in seven parts, each of those reserved for one day of the week. In the first part, we will note the dreams concerning the night fr om Friday to Saturday. In the second, we note those of the night from Saturday to S unday and so on. We will add the phase of the Moon. When the contents of a dream will seem to have been of some importance, for example in the night of Sunday to Monday, the next evening, or better, the following Sunday evening, we will imbibe ourselves with it again and will meditate on it right before going to sleep. We will later proceed in a similar manner during the same phase of the Moon. This is why we should note our dreams as soon as we awaken. This can sometimes be in the middle of the night. W ith training, we will see that a keyword is enough to recall the whole dream. Progressi vely, the dreams will link together, will become coherent, bringing us increasingly clear answers. The ordinary dream This is the most common way of dreaming, one that we have all experienced since childhood, the contents of which can seems harmless or insistent, clear or confused, nice or heavy, etc. It is always a journey from which we come back with luggage, the contents of which we should hasten to inventory in view of understanding the path we should follow. Two situations often present themselves in dreams. In the first one, the dreamer is passive. Even if he is an actor in the action which is playing, he practically cannot change its course. In the second one, on the contrary, the dreamer is active. He intervenes in the play that is acted and can modify its course. On this level of ordinary dream, the subject lives in a world close to our level. Exteriorization of consciousness In this method, consciousness will search fo r information by moving outside of the body, either spontaneously or as the result of a learned technique, or by out of body experience during sleep. It is here neither what we call a true contact nor even a dream. It is only a conscious bridging of levels 10-9 . Here we remain in the immediate environment and, in general we do not have access to level 9. The consciousness is freed in its perception of the opacity of the physical body that we can s ee inanimate below us and of the density of our space-time. Since this zone is loaded with polluted and negative thought-forms, you should abide by nothing during this experience. In this experience, the exteriorization of consciousness gives us practically no knowledge. Its interest resides in the fact that consciousness can operate outside the body. We can see and hear without the support of the sensory organs of the physical body. Some non-dangerous practices on this s ubject have been explained well enough by different authors.

In the experience, we have a vision or information, but we have no inner transformation. In other words, the result of the experience is only in our memory. This can indeed give a lot of strength to continue our work. On the other hand, the Great Experience (it is good to remember) can lead to a progressive change of our inner structures because of all the work that was achieved while preparing for it. But as we said, the primer for this transformation will need to be “maintained” as it is not yet an initiation. The “superior” dream We call it “superior” for it goes well beyond th e physical impressions of our world. It occurs beyond level 9 . From level 8 on, all negativity has disappeared; there is no risk of error of information. The “superior” dream is rich in subtle sensations, and already in heartfelt emotions, in transcendent contacts from which we return cleansed, purified. Here there has been contact. The awakened dream Different from the method of projecti on where consciousness goes to look for information, here it is the information that comes to consciousness. It registers almost clearly in the guise of writing or drawing as if projected on a screen. The subject remains in his body. What is important is that its content is always authentic. We then read a text or a symbol, which are answers to the ques tion asked. This practice is often triggered spontaneously. We must therefore be very atten tive to the state in which we were the first time it happened so we can try to re-trigger it later on. This is a true contact. Contact with the Inner Master This contact can be triggered during the Gr eat Experience but could also occur at any other moment. We distinguish the contact th at puts us on the vibratory rate of level 6 by interior resonance from the “open” contact that is the direct conversation with the Inner Master where the information arrives directly and clearly. We emphasize that in the first scenario it is only a contact, which is alrea dy encouraging. In the second case, it is an initiation on level 6, where the subject can now raise himself at will. It is an acquired permanent faculty. It is essentially in the Return that the Inner Master, “suppressed” as it were in the Descent, is ready to manifest Himself. The contacts are therefore the normal outcome of all meditation, of all internalization, whether in the waking state or in dreams. They are inherent to the structure of man. The approach we took is not limited only to the structure of the Great Experience, even though it remains the aim of this treatise. In order to lose as little as possible of the sense of the messages perceived through these contacts, we must train to decode them through a constant practice. Our goal is to be able to drive our own Vehicle as well as knowing how to decipher the “roadmaps” during our escapes. Very often symbols figure in it. Their role of relay between the unconscious and the conscious are a great clarification and allow us to get better directions. We will study rapidly some basic principles concerning the symbols.

Some bear practical information that is easy to interpret; others remain enigmatic as long as we don’t know how to decipher them. Stating that a symbol is a key to reach a field of knowledge or/and to go from the exterior towards the interi or seems a given. In our study, in our inner searches, the function of the symbol is to be a true key of Contact between two worlds, between two space-times. If, for example, in our inner experiences, the traditional symbol of the planet appears, the information is direct and no interpretation is necessary. However it isn’t always like that. Therefore we must be very attentive to the symbols that we will meet in our inner worlds. Most are vi sual, but they can also be sounds. When we will have acquired the habit of decoding them , we will have to build our own personal system of references. THE VISUAL SYMBOLS THE CASTLES OF THE INVISIBLE These are dwellings in the Invisible, called “cas tles” in esotericism. Three of these have been previously discussed in the meditations of the Great Experience. Often we are thrust in one of these castles before even trying to construct it, and its architecture then reveals to us the level contacted. Castle of level 3 Rather than the pyramid described previousl y, and more adapted to the work on the New Tree, the “castle” is here a cathedral with a single spire where we will enter on Saturday. Castle of level 4 It is either a temple, of a church or be tter a cathedral, places where spiritual knowledge will be transmitted. Go there on Thursday.

Castle of level 6 This is the castle of the Sun King dominated by a blue sky that we have described in the mansions of the Invisible. This is a harmonious construction with its reception hall and its classroom, the dwelling of the Inner Self. Open to visit, particularly on Sunday. Castle of level 7 It is here a tall construction made entirely of wood, very often placed in gigantic trees or in lush forests, where we will certainly return on Friday. Castle of level 8 This type of castle is related to the castle of the Bavarian kings, to the Walt Disney castle in Sleeping Beauty or in Snow White. Fairy lik e, this castle is in general comprised of three parts, each with a teaching: Alchemy in the laboratory, Natural Magic in the oratory and Astrology in the observatory. Each of thes e sections is led by a teacher who has an ancient profile, like the Thoth or Hermes Tris megistus type. It is good to try a meeting on Wednesday. Castle of level 9 As previously mentioned, there is no castle of 9 strictly speaking, but a mansion of grayish aspect, two or three stories high, surrounded by water and dominated by a grey sky. In the library an armchair is waiting for you. You can try a contact on Monday. The contact in one of these castles brings us in relation with the content adapted to the corresponding space-time; either the contact occurs spontaneously in projection, or in dreams, which is the most common, or when we search to trigger it by meditation. We must further our investigations when we begin to get our bearings. For example, if we are in front of the door of the castle, our inner leve l is close to the level of this castle. If the door opens it’s the symbol that the interior initia tion of this level is in progress. If we are in the castle our level of inner awakening is of this castle. If we are above the castle, our consciousness has the possibility to access the level above this castle. THE GODS As well as the symbols of universal character that we will study later, numerous symbols are part of our culture, such as the gods a ssigned to each planet according to the Greek and Roman mythology. In this domain we must remember that the fundamental law of each level is double. Therefore, the god re presents one aspect and the goddess the complementary aspect. It is therefore intere sting to succinctly recall their function and their attributes here. Saturn-Chronos (Chronos) (level 3 ) This god reigns at the limit of the finite-infin ite and is the Master of Time.

Venus-Aphrodite (level 7 ) Goddess of love and beauty, it is here where levels 7-6 are joining that we acquire the continuity of consciousness and where we are dispensed to drink the waters of the Lethe. The Invisible sun of this Planet is enclosed in the aura of the Visibl e Sun, symbolic of the solar marriage. Mercury-Hermes (level 8) He is the messenger of the gods. He holds in his hand the caduceus and wears winged sandals, symbols of the strength of elevation a nd an aptitude to move rapidly. As we said repeatedly, his role is to facilitate the tran smission of contacts between the invisible and the visible world. He is the invisible operator that must ensure that we get good communication. Diana-Artemis (level 9 ) She carries a Moon crescent in her hair. Protecting feminine life and fecundity, she presides over the birth of beings and over their development, even though she can also remove life (Diana the huntress). CRYSTALS As we saw in the Mineral Tree, the archetypes of each of the invisible levels remain in resonance with one of the 7 types of crystal of the dense visible level (Figure 8 ). So, it will be interesting to know how to identif y the types of crystals that we could “encounter”. The contacts triggered by crystals in one of the levels higher than 10 will be related to the others since each level in re sonance awakens the qualitie s of which it is the bearer.

However, most often it will appear as one of those on Figure 8 that allows us to identify it. As the first contacts often occur in the Mine ral Tree, it can then be useful to acquire a book on minerals. Although we study symbols here, you will have understood that at this stage of the Treatise the student that wishes to meditate on symbolic objects such as minerals can easily pursue this work in his oratory after having discharged then charged crystals as explained in Part II of chapter “Fixing the en ergy”. We are now familiar with the fact that on earth the levels of the energies vary unceasingly following the rules of the planetary energies. When a type of crystal is at its maximum of intensity, this crystal will increase its load of energy. On the other hand, if it is in presence of a body having little or no energy, it will transmit its own energy to th is body by discharging. It is therefore © Triad Publishing, 2007.

If you cannot get a type of crystal for a selected level, you can, for any level, use unprocessed s ea salt, crystallized in a cubic lattice. We will execute a meditation in the presence of th e prepared crystal, facing the New Tree, in the first hour that follows sunrise, on the day of the planetary ruler. The aim is to trigger both psychic and physical effects through these contacts. We issue a warning about wearing crystals permanently. When they have been suitably “prepared” in the oratory, they are bearers of the properties indicated above. Therefore there is a true energetic reorganization produ ced in our structure that we must conduct progressively or risk becoming too unsettled. This is particularly true for the diamond that belongs to level 3 . Given that it vibrates at the highest level, it must be worn only intermittently. When you go out for a reception or a party, it will have a beneficial effect for your being when in contact with others . If worn permanently, diamonds can induce real trouble for certain people via their “cleani ng” action. Some have misinterpreted this effect and declared that some stones bring misfortune. NUMBERS AND GEOMETRIC FORMS The interest of these symbols is that th ey possess a universal character and are not marked by a specific egregore. Number 1 - The Point 1 - symbolizes Unity-Eternity or the Unitary Energy. The Point in an experience is often the indication of a near contact out of space-time. This has been the case precisely for those that have had the Experience of the Point, whether from the Great Experience or spontaneously. Number 2 - Straight Line 2 - symbolizes duality The straight line is a series of points side by side that divides space in two parts. The straight vertical line represents the Active or time. The horizontal line represents the Passive or space. Number 3 - Triangle (Figure 29 ) This is the first manifestation of form. 3 is the symbol of the rise or of the descent of the energies. The triangle is the basis for the symbols of the four fundamental elements of nature. It is the symbol of the level of passage Eternity/space-times or Infinite-finite. From this number on, the geometric form is a polygon. When the polygon is radiant, the energy escapes via the points. Number 4 - Square (Figure 29) With 4 appears the first level truly separated from Unity. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

In A the lines interior to the square that represent the passive and active energies are fixed by the sides. This square does not radiate. In B the four energies arrive in the angles: the Fire and Air energies radiate via the points of the vertical line and Water and Earths by the points of the horizontal line. Number 5 - Pentagon (Figure 29) 5 symbolizes the realized man, the balance of the four elements awakened in him, or the quintessence. In A the pentagon radiates little energy. In B the pentagon possesses a strong radiation, it is the pentagram. The pentagram, pointing up, symbolizes the man of the Return, the Spirit-man. The pentagram, pointing down, symbolizes th e man of the Descent, the Matter-man and the physical body of man. Number 6 - Hexagon (Figure 29) This is the solar number, the number of the Inner Master. In A the hexagon radiates little energy. In B the hexagon possesses a strong radiation, this is the hexagram. The triangle of Fire in front of the triangl e of Water symbolizes the union of the two worlds. It is for each of us the key that opens the door of the Temple. Number 7 - Heptagon (Figure30) This is the number of the planetary energies, of the days of the week, etc. There exist three heptagons of which two are starry or two heptagrams that each have a proper meaning that is part of the personal search. Number 8 - Octagon (Figure30) This number is the principle of the double quaternary. 8 is Eternity in activity. 8 concerns particularly the use of one of the four elements or several simultaneously in our esoteric work. The octagon can be formed of two squares, each symbolizing a face of the quaternary. But a continuous tracing is possible (8 b) going from one point to another or: 1 → 4 → 7 → 2 → 5 → etc. This octagon is traced without lifting the tip of the pencil. Its radiation is more important than the one previously drawn. Number 9 - Enneagon (Figure30) This is the symbol of the world just above ours, the world of the Moon in Qabala. The preferable enneagon for our work is made by three equilateral triangles (9 c). In a numerological system used for initiation, only the numbers from 1 to 9 are used. If the number found is higher than 9, it must be reduced. So for instance the number of the © Triad Publishing, 2007.

We obtain: 10 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 26 that is “reduced” to: 2 + 6 = 8, the figure of the double quaternary. Through those nine numbers we gave only the polygons assigned to the levels and to the planets whose correspondences are always direct. Three other important symbols are described below: 10 , 11 and 12 . Number 10 - Decagon (Figure30) This is the symbol of the Unitary Energy acting in duality, the symbol of the physical world. The decagon often comes in the form of two starry pentagons. On our level 10 the symbol of man, the pentagon, is therefore double (10 c): a white pentagon pointing up placed in front of a black pentagon pointing down. We then have: 5+5= 10, sign of duality. Number 11 - Undecagon It is, like 1 , outside of the levels. This is the symbol of material duality: 1+1 . Number 12 - Dodecagon Also outside of the levels, it is the material symmetry of levels 1 and 2 . When one of these three levels appears in our experiences, we must no longer refer to the planets. We are in the cycle of twelve . We must then refer to the twelve permutations of the Unpronounceable Name, to the twelve signs of the zodiac, to the twelve apostles, to the twelve tribes of Israel, etc. There exist two symbols that have the character of the Infinite: the point and the circle. The circle has neither beginning nor end. The point of Eternity becomes the circle (Figure 2) that includes in itself the vertical line: the active energy, time not yet manifested and the horizontal line: the pa ssive energy, space not yet manifested. The utilization of the circle as a symbol of these two energies is justified by the character of extension of these energies to the totality of the manifested Universe. In the junction Unity-Duality, there is sepa ration between Active and Passive. This still happens in the non-manifested Infinite. Theref ore the lines representing the energies are inside the circles. The manifestation takes its limited-finite aspect only in the representation of the triangle as studied in the first part of this treatise: Triangle of Fire: symbol of the active and free spiritual energy, Triangle of Air: symbol of the passive spiritual energy, Triangle of Water: symbol of the active free material energy, Triangle of Earth: symbol of the passive material energy. It is therefore a general rule: when a symbol is enclosed in the tracing of another, that means that the one enclosed is passive, weak or even not manifested. To move forward rapidly in the decoding of the graphical and numerological symbols, it is good to classify them with their qualitie s. For example, on different pages of a © Triad Publishing, 2007.

THE MAGICAL SQUARES (Figure 32) This is the name given to the tables including numbers from 1 to N, N being the square of a number. The specificity of these tables is th at the total sum of the numbers that appear on each horizontal line and on each vertical line are always the same, for example 15 for the square of 3. There are seven tables of magical squares from 3 to 9. We do not think that their true function is useful here.

Th ey are transmitted to us because we either heard them or have pronounced them in dreams, in meditation or in internalization. These are always names of power. These are snippets of language of one of the levels contacted. These precious contributions have the properties of the level they come from. Their use must be measured as they allow us to vibrate in the space-time that they have come from. This will allow us to harmonize and solve some points of imbalance that are in us and eventually in others, if we obtain the ability and the inner authorization. Through our Contact of Eternity, there will re main in us, almost always unconscious, a word or Name of Eternity empowering us w ith an unknown faculty of our material world. This is why we must be very attentive to a ll that can emerge after the Great Experience. The main difficulty to understand comes from the fact that our earthly language is not adapted to these elevations of consciousness. Most of the time we cannot comprehend nor express clearly what was perceived at the tim e of our contact in one of these space times. But through meditation, we can adapt these preci ous snippets of the Original Language to our level. In the beginning of the chapter YOD HE VAV HE ( ), the original language is Unitary and the multiplication of the languages of the Bible represents the loss of Unity of this Language in the stages of the des cent in Duality. The symbol of the Tower of Babel or the confusion of tongues arises from this. Generally the Experience of Eternity awaken s in us a psychic faculty, an occult power: the higher the level, the more powerful the name. In the origin, the language of the thought at very high level of consciousness was a creator directly. In the Bible, when it is said that man named the animals, it means that the thought of the Being in the Origin has directly created the animal kingdom by the power of the Word. Even a momentary access to a level of higher consciousness is like a journey in a foreign © Triad Publishing, 2007.

We can acquire some useful words without yet knowing all the expressions of this langua ge. When a name has been transmitted to us, either because we “read” it or “heard” it, it is always a name of power, a key that gives access to the space-time from which it comes. It is the symbol of access to the related interior world for the person that receives it. THE TWELVE NAMES At the end of the 2 nd Part of this treatise, we cam e upon one of the aspects of the symbolism of the Divine Tetragrammaton (YOD HE VAV HE – please remember that Hebrew is read from right to left) and we established the alchemical- qabalistic correspondence to each of the letters composing this Name (Figure 14) . Our modern alphabets do not permit a correct reproduction of the Tetragrammaton, let alone its pronunciation. So it is often referred to as the Unpronounceable Name. When the interesting substitution of alchemical symbols is introduced, it limits the interpretation to the domain of Duality. We can notice again that in the Tetragra mmaton there is no “final” Hebrew letter (Figure 15) , in other words a letter whose numerical valu e changes when it is placed at the end of word. Therefore the value of the unpronoun ceable name does not change when the position of the composing letters form another name: Yod = 10 He = 5 Vav = 6 He = 5 is 26 . The number of possible permutations when we have four elements is calculated in the following manner: 1 x 2 x 3 x 4, or 24. Concer ning the four letters composing the Name, two are identical. This reduces the possible number of permutations to twelve . The twelve Names formed from the Tetragrammaton are sometimes named “the twelve Banners of the Powerful Name”. They are of equivalent numerical values but, of course, of different pronunciations. (YOD HE VAV HE) symbolizes the being, human in his Origin. The twelve permutations also represent twelve types of Beings or twelve Human Types in Nature. These twelve types of Man in Creation are symbolized by the twelve tribes of Israel corresponding with the twelve philosophical mansions, with the twelve signs of the zodiac, etc.  The Twelve Banners of the Powerful Name These twelve permutations follow each other continuously and always in the same order in human beings and in Nature through the elem ents. They have some different actions in their resonance, or better, in the power of action of the Word. Additionally, each of us, in © Triad Publishing, 2007. All rights reserved. 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Jean Dubuis The Experience of Eternity his evolution, has a Name that goes su ccessively through each of the twelve permutations. If an astrological correspondence exists, it does not mean that the zodiacal sign of our birth gives us a valid indica tion to know our present Name. Only the revelations from our Inner Self will indi cate with certainty our true Name. Such knowledge serves as a key in our Inner Worlds. The history of the dispersion of the twelve tribes of Israel is related to the repulsion- attraction phenomenon seen in the chapter of th e Nadir. The forces of dispersion of the Descent allow the group forming the twelve tribes to separate from the All-Universe, then the being to separate from the group to allo w the individualization of each human seed. It is only after the complete realization of this liberation that the Initiation of the Nadir will re-establish the pre-eminence of attraction over repulsion and unification over dispersion. Upon each incarnation, a rotation occurs and the being passes from one tribe to the other and changes Name. The knowledge of this Name allows for harmonizing points of inner imbalance. On Figure 13 each letter of the Tetragrammaton is allocated a Tree. This correspondence is the base for the twelve Permutations of the Divine Name. The Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Creation, will implicitly enlighten us on this matter. In this book there is practically no mention of the Earth element c onsidered as energy. We must consider that the Earth element is the basis of each of the f our Trees or columns included in us. It is the foundation, the receptacle of the energies that animate us. We therefore have in us four “Earths”: The Earth of Earth or the Mineral Tree, The Earth of Water or the Plant Tree, The Earth of Air or the Animal Tree, The Earth of Fire or the Tree of Man. Therefore only the three energies Water, Air a nd Fire are active. Each of these energies created on the Earth a Tree to animate it, so that we have 3 x 4 = 12 phases to accomplish a complete cycle of animation (Figure 31 ). When the cycles will be accomplished, when the twelve types of beings in us will have walked the Path of Return, the New Name will be the name of the Realized Being: (ALEPH HE YOD HE) Or I AM , the Name that we will know how to pronounce.

LET’S TAKE STOCK If you worked on the first two parts of this treatise, and if you meditated on Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings, a change has taken place in you. Even though the Great Experience has not yet been granted to you, a certain inner awakening occurred. This awakening will progressively exteriorize until it takes the aspects indicated previously in the third part: 1) Ordinary dream but recurring systematically the same day of the week. 2) Dream with state of consciousness iden tical or superior to our physical world. 3) Awakened dream where the consciousness f unctions both on the physical level and in one of the invisible worlds. 4) Exteriorization of consciousness. 5) Regular experience in one of the castles of the Invisible, particularly on level 8 . 6) Contact with the Inner Self. 7) Conversation with the Inner Self. 8) Contact of Eternity, possibility to access to the totality of Knowledge. From this Great Experience, the harvesting is different for each of us. This is normal as the ripening of the inner work of each being proceeds with certain slowness. Also, from this Contact: - Some have had immediate revelation of their Path and especially the revelation of their Becoming. From there, they have full knowledge of the Work they have to accomplish because at the instant of contact, the extens ion of consciousness to the totality of time and space gives the possibility of access to the totality of Knowledge. - Some brought back a Key concerning their Path. - Some have brought back “only” the Experience of the Point that characterizes the Great Experience. They lived at the rhythm of a breathing we could call cosmic. In that experience, the entire being is a point of concentration, a breath, a pulsation where thinking and acting is confused to be only one, in other words that as soon as the thought is emitted, the thing is , achieved, in an All, vast, clear, intelligent, infinite, simple, harmonious... - Some have brought back “nothing”; at least th is is what they believe. This nothing, this mere nothing, is nonetheless registered in them . In the beginning of this first try of the Great Experience, although the knowledge per ceived during the Contact is total or almost total, the part that remains afterw ards is very weak because the density of consciousness on the level of the Earth blocks the subtle information. This is similar to what happens when waking up after a night of sleep. © Triad Publishing, 2007.

As already underlined, our personal revelation will be the sum of these acquisitions obtained during a series of similar experiences. The passage of our consciousness of Eternity to our space-time filtered and fixed a considerable amount of knowledge. In the same way, but to a lesser degree, the difference of space-times in relation to the one of our world will also have a filtering effect. This is why the repetition of the diffe rent exercises of the different levels, in particular on level 3, will revive this knowledge via a faster and more efficient transmission. Additionally, the passage of one space-time to another changes the code of language. That is why in the first contacts with the Inner Self the transmission is only symbolic. There exists, for example through dreams, an interesting phenomenon that shows where the aptitude of our consciousness is in interp reting correctly the aspects of a space-time different from the Earth’s. The dreams of th e day of the week begin to happen regularly but still in an incoherent form. Then, progr essively, logic and coherence increase in dreams. It means that the translation done by consciousness becomes correct. What was studied with the symbols does not ex clusively concern the identification of the level of a contact or an experience. Another aspect is characterized by the effort of our own inner levels to transmit to us the useful elements for our path. Paracelsus said: “No one will transmute matter lest he has already transmuted himself”. If the general rules of each of the differe nt systems of symbols are analogous, it is appropriate to establish a personalized interp retation. Here again, there is no master. Each of us must find what is good for him by a system that will be held entirely secret; no one other than you must know your interior being. As long as our Return is not definitive, the contributions of the levels of Duality are useful to us, even if only as road signs. In order to make dynamic the awakening in pr ogress, a last work is recommended in the Tree of Fire. EXERCISES ON THE FIRE ELEMENT (Figure 32 ) These exercises are intended to repair the seven invisible bodies we have in us and to cause a transformation that will help re-establish a certain communication between several levels and the consciousness of the Earth. Become familiar with all the elements of th e Tree: numbers that symbolize levels and planets, polygons. For each of these polygons we can have prev iously drawn or cut out each of them. (Figure 29 and 30, including the Fire element). In the oratory, - Place in front of you, against the mirror, th e figures of the New Tree and of the Fire element, © Triad Publishing, 2007.

It is the corresponding invisible body that will receive the manifested energy. In the beginning, we will concentrate on each form for the day concerned, by placing the symbol vertically to respect the verticality of the triangle of Fire. But then it is on the Tree itself that we will work in the oratory. The inner transformation necessary for the In itiation cannot be completed in a very short time. The physical body is able to withstand only slow variations of the energy that animates it. A regularity as great as possible in these exercises will be profitable. The influences of levels 3, 4 , and 5 will remain unconscious for a long time. They belong to the major initiations, or great Mysteries. Placed above the solar level, they can occur only after the long work that leads to the minor initiations, or small Mysteries, of levels 9, 8 and 7 . Then the initiation of level 6 occurs which is one of the first great and true initiations. Do not forget to place in the cen ter of the hexagram a small nugget of native gold that contains the energy of this level, the energy of the solar Fire. From time to time, for example once a quarter, after the meditation of level 6 , concentrate on the Tree (Figure 32) and meditate on the fact that this center is united to all the points of the Universe through the channels of ener gy (the paths of the classical Tree, Figure 4). Considering the strong power of evocation of this figure, it can happen that after the meditation a fatigue follows. In this case, concentrate a few moments either on the column of the spiritual energies (on the right of the Tree) the effects of which can be felt on the right side of the body, or on the column of the material energies (on the left of the Tree) that sustain the physical body. This is an initiatic work that overflows a little from the scope of this treatise but that we judged important to transmit at the present tim e. If an initiatic work has never been done previously, it is recommended, before begi nning the work on the polygons and the Fire element, to have had a certain result in th e exercise of the mirror indicated in the beginning of this treatise. Do not confuse initiation and inner experience. In the case of initiation, there is a change of our inner stru cture. This modification will be permanent for this present incarnation and all the following ones. In all the systems of initiation, there is a general rule that applies in all path s: the internal structures can be restored only by the use of the power of inner creation of the human beings. ETHICS This slow enterprise of our personal Quest can happen only through the greatest ethics. If the powers restored at the time of the clim b are a prerogative of the being, man has the duty to use them to serve and not to be served. The Service is sometimes difficult to understand. As long as we do not have the Conversation, it is wise to use the powers always for our own path. We do not have to transmit to others the keys received. Each © Triad Publishing, 2007.

It is with the best intention of the world that beings having a certain liberty of inner action are inclined to do good. They want to heal , they want to relieve and they want to solve some complex problems... This require s reason and wisdom. When we have the power to heal others, always asks the Inner Self if that is in agreement with the inner state of the sick person. The illnesses that arise in life are very often due to a disharmony in the conduct of our existence. Many people who ha ve known how to reorient their Route, after a certain amelioration of their health, or even after their recovery, did not see the illness return. If someone has an errone ous behavior, the contribution of energy transmitted will not “hold” very long and there will be recurrence, simply because there is infraction with one of the laws of Nature that is economical with its energy. On the other hand, we must well gr asp that energy is neutral. It is . Only its use is positive or negative. The energy sent to others will undoubtedly bring them strength during a certain time. We cannot however direct the acti on of the “reinforced” re ceiver even if we have this power. Each one having to walk his specific Route, we have no right to orient it authoritatively for others.

So it is good to recall the Seven Commandments of the Fama Fraternitatis that have been the emanation of the Invisible Order that existed in Germany in the beginning of 17 th century. These seven rules are addressed to those on the Path of Return. Although expressed in a form somewhat out of date, their meaning retains a universal character: 1) You won't serve God and Mammon (do not confuse Service and Silver, each of them having a different function). 2) You won't sell the gift of God (if you developed a power to help others, do not sell it). 3) You will wear the costume of your country (act in silence; do not try to get recognition by any exterior sign). 4) If you practice a religion, let it be the one of your country (the true religion is the one that leads to the true religare or link between the small king - man of Earth - and the Great King - the Inner Self). 5) You won't subsidize hospitals or churches (the inner powers that give healing have no need of material support even if the initiate is doctor). 6) You won't demonstrate the doctrine through miracles (he who recovers his keys must act with wisdom; he does not have to let others admire him for his knowledge). 7) You will have neither master nor servant (we must present ourselves free at the Door of the Temple; liberty is imperative in the pa th of the true Initiation and true liberty is acquired only in solitude).

Each of us during the Return w ill have access by his work to the different levels, which means that each can act according to the laws of the different space-times in which he will have access. This is of course a repetition at this stage of the Treatise, but it is important to help the student who is too often brought to thinks that he is excluded from the Path because he has no consciousness of his moving forward. In fact: - The sincere student very often has c onstant access to high powers but he is unconscious of it. - During a contact of a level, in particular in awakened dream, for the duration of this contact, the person has the powers of this level. - The initiate of a level has the permanent powers of this level. The work that leads to the Great Experience also aims to make the different levels in us vibrate and to awaken them, in particular levels 3 , 6 , and 9 , which are the backbone of the New Tree. Upon return from this Experi ence, we are accompanied by a tremendous energy that can lead to the awakening of level 6 . When this occurs, we are not necessarily and probably are not a great Initiate, because nobody other than ourselves can complete the construction of the Great Tree of Fire in our being. Only our work will contribute to that. But at this stage we have no more need for courses, books or anything else for our initiation, our Great Return, since all that is necessary will be given to us by our Inner Self. Errors will no longer be possible, progress will be rapid. Sendivogius says, then, to the Adept: “Now, burn all your books, mine included” . Ora et Labora Jean DUBUIS  © Triad Publishing, 2007.

The three Kings represent here the three activ e elements, engines of our Initiation: Water, Air and Fire. The Kings travel towards the Orient, the point where the Sun rises. Sunrise is considered to be the symbol of the awak ening of the Inner Master, level 6, or Tiphereth in Qabala, said to be the dwelling of the Inner Master. The Adept that reaches this point no longer has a need for a Master or for books to continue the Path of Initiation until his Return in Eternity. The star symbolized by the hexagram repres ents the inner state acquired by the Adept: The link between the physical body (triangle of the Matter-energy) and the spiritual bodies (triangle of the Spirit-energies) has been re-established. Inside the Hexagram: - the two triangles on the left represent the passive elements - the two triangles on the right represent the active elements - at the apex of the Spirit triangle the alchemical Sulfur is represented - at the bottom of the Matter triangle the alchemical Salt is represented - the central symbol is Venus The symbol of the Mercury principle is intentionally not represented. Indeed the junction between the world of Matter and th e world of Spirit ensured by the Mercury- energy is now completed. Venus the planet of love now animates the Inner Self. © Triad Publishing, 2007.
