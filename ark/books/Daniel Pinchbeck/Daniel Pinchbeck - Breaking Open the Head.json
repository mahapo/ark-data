I wanted to know whycertain substances are revered in tribal societies throughout the world butrepressed as well as ridiculed in contemporary Western cultures. In the West,these substances are called “psychedelics,” a class of drugs that radicallyalter consciousness and perception. Unlike heroin or cocaine, most psychedelicsare neither physically harmful or habit-forming. Yet they are considered sofrightening and dangerous that possession of them is punished by long prisonsentences. Although they were once thought to “expand consciousness,” whichsounds at least theoretically desirable, no sane adult can be allowed legalaccess to them.The word psychedelic—“mind-manifesting”—was coined in the 1950s during ourculture’s brief enthusiasm for chemical self-discovery. The term itself is a bitvague, as the entire set of these substances tends to escape preciseclassification. In this book, I have, for the most part, limited my discussionto traditional and well-known visionary catalysts includingpsilocybin-containing mushrooms, peyote, the Amazonian potion ayahuasca, LSD,iboga, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT). I have also looked into a few recentdiscoveries. To keep my task manageable, I have not discussed marijuana orecstasy (better described as an “empathodelic”), or ketamine (an anaestheticinducing out-of-body experiences).In the mid-1960s, most of the known psychedelics were outlawed, and themainstream vogue for consciousness expansion ended soon after. In the nextdecades, the media repeatedly associated psychedelics with blown minds, wastedpotential, and social chaos. The notion persists that to dabble in psychedelics,to trip, is to risk madness.Preserved in pockets of the undeveloped world, shielded from the rapid ravagesof modernization by dense jungles or mountains, it is still possible toencounter intact shamanic cultures. Among these people, plants that inducevisions are the center of spiritual life and tradition. They believe that theseplants are sentient beings, supernatural emissaries. They ascribe their musicand medicine, their cosmology and extensive botanical knowledge to the visionsgiven to them in psychedelic trance. For tribes in Africa, Siberia, North andSouth America, and many other regions, rejection of the visionary knowledgeoffered by the botanical world would be a form of insanity.While researching this book, I visited shamans in West Africa, Mexico, and theEcuadorean Amazon. In Gabon, a small country on the equator, I went through aBwiti initiation, eating iboga, a psychedelic rootbark that induces a trancelasting for thirty hours. Some of the Bwiti call this ceremony “breaking openthe head.” The bark powder temporarily releases the soul from the body, allowingthe initiate entry into the African spiritual cosmos, where he is shown theoutline of his fate.Breaking Open the Head follows two tracks. On the one hand, I examine thecultural history of psychedelic compounds in the modern West, looking at theintersection of archaic drugs and modern thinkers leading to the 1960s—a failedmass-cultural voyage of shamanic initiation—and up to the present day. Oneinspiration is Walter Benjamin, the German Jewish thinker who experimented withhashish and mescaline in the 1920s. Benjamin thought that visionaryintoxication, achieved through drugs or other means, could be a “profaneillumination,” shattering the hypnotic trance of modern life. “The reader, thethinker, the flaneur, are types of illuminati just as much as the opium eater,the dreamer, the ecstatic,” Benjamin wrote. “Not to mention that most terribledrug—ourselves—which we take in solitude.”“That most terrible drug,” myself, is the subject of the book’s other inquiry.Once upon a time, not so long ago, I was a typical Manhattan atheist,suspicious, cynical, disbelieving in metaphysical possibilities. Due to a tweakin my character, my cynicism increasingly tormented me. Without any highervision, life seemed unbearable and pointless. Compelled by my despair andself-disgust, I decided to poke at the limits of my disbelief. If not the safestor most legal route, certain chemical catalysts seemed the fastest and mostdirect means of self-testing whether this reality was all that could be known.Taking myself as a psychedelic case history, I describe my own leaps and crashesthrough the neurochemical looking glass. Breaking Open the Head tells the storyof how my own head was broken open, and how I have gingerly tried to put thepieces back together. It is the record of a subjective, incomplete, occasionallyharrowing, often alienating, yet exhilarating and fun process of discovery andtransformation.I believe that psychedelic drugs, used carefully, are profound tools forself-exploration. The forbidden substances can be a precision technology forrevealing the interstitial processes of thinking, the flickering candle sputtersof emotion, the fine-tuned machinery of sense perceptions. The unfolding of theself through an increase in perception, cognition, and feeling is one level ofthe trip. On low doses, that is all you get, and often it is enough.The next level begins where consciousness, suddenly able to go beyond its normalboundaries, bursts open on the nonordinary world. It fascinates me that thesetwo levels are so closely related. It is as if the mind were a rocket, gatheringforce as it speeds along a runway until it finally lifts into space, beyond thetug of gravity, where all the rules are different. Why should a process thatbegins by sharpening normal perceptions—making colors brighter, enhancingawareness of patterns in nature—lead seamlessly into “abnormal” perceptions,into paintings that breathe, statues that dance, trees that writhe with facesand limbs? Not to mention, as yet, those geometric and hallucinatory vistas ofunleashed Otherness, revealed to the closed eyes.The visionary power of psychedelics remains a mystery, one that was abandoned bythe scientific academy when psychedelics were made illegal a generation ago.Equally mysterious: Why should the private exploration of one’s inner reality,by chemical or other means, be considered a serious threat to a “free society”?In The Long Trip, a study of visionary drug use through history, Paul Devereuxmuses: “I sometimes wonder if our culture, acting in the manner of a singleorganism—in the way a crowd of people or a classroom of students sometimescan—somehow senses a deep threat to its own philosophical foundations residingin the psychedelic experience. This might help account for the otherwiseirrational hatred and repression of the use of hallucinogens, and the smirkingdismissal of the psychedelic experience as a trivial one by so many of ourintellectuals.”It is the nature of repression to be invisible. Something that is repressedcan’t reveal itself to us, can’t appear as a break in our awareness—then wewould see its workings, and the repression would be dispelled. In a world ofinformation overload and perpetual distraction, repression manifests as adismissive giggle, a yawn of boredom, a sin of omission.“Repression is reflexive,” notes the literary critic Frederic Jameson, “that is,it aims not only at removing a particular object from consciousness, but alsoand above all, at doing away with the trace of that removal as well, atrepressing the very memory of the intent to repress.” For over thirty years, atremendous force of cultural repression has been exerted on the subject ofpsychedelics.And yet it cannot be said that our culture frowns on the use ofconsciousness-changing substances. Marijuana is forbidden, but alcohol andnicotine—far more destructive drugs—are consumed in mass quantities. Whilepsychedelics are outlawed, 27 million Americans currently take antidepressantssuch as Zoloft or Prozac. These days, most people are far more suspicious ofplant compounds safely ingested by human beings for tens of thousands of yearsthan they are of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or otherpowerful, utterly synthetic, mood and mind-altering drugs created in the lastdecades by a pharmacological industry motivated by profit.Antidepressants fit our society’s underlying biases. Psychedelics, emphatically,do not. Is it possible that we have demonized hallucinogens because we fear thecontents of our own minds?When he tried mescaline for the first time, the chemist Sasha Shulgin found “theworld amazed me, in that I saw it as I had when I was a child. I had forgottenthe beauty and the magic and the knowingness of it and me.” He realized the tinyamount of white powder he had ingested could not have caused such profoundvisions. It had only revealed what was inside of him. He understood that “ourentire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit. We may choose not tofind access to it, we may even deny its existence, but it is indeed there insideus, and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability.”The nature of consciousness remains a mystery that Western science cannotpenetrate. It is not only that our scientists can approach the mind fromoutside, through descriptions of its functions and logical deductions. There isno means for science, as it is presently constituted, to ask, let alone seek, ananswer to the question, Why am I here now? And yet that question forms the basisof an individual’s thoughts and perceptions. Of course, I am not saying thatpsychedelics provide an instant answer to that question, but they offer adifferent set of lenses through which to look at the problem.The self-enclosed logic of secular materialism denies any independent existenceto the soul, attributing all facets of the human personality to the synapticalwiring of the brain. Psychedelics indicate that this is not the wholestory—especially the lightning strike of dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a chemicalproduced by our own bodies and by many plants. Smoking DMT is like being shotfrom a cannon into another dimension and returning to this world in less thanten minutes. The DMT revelation strongly suggests that the psyche cannot bereduced to a manifestation of our physical hardware.Carl Jung wrote: “People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order toavoid facing their own souls.” Is it possible that our society has built up avast edifice of technology and propaganda in order to avoid that innerconfrontation? Enveloped by media and technology, we have come to prefersecondhand images to inner experience—what Jung called “the adventure of thespirit.” The self-knowledge achieved through personal discovery and visionarystates seems alien, even repellent, compared to the voyeuristic gaze, thevirtual entertainments and hypnotic distractions of contemporary culture.Perhaps we are due—even overdue—for a change.Considering the world’s present state of uncertainty, it might seem a strangemoment to argue for the validity of controlled shamanic explorations. The entiresubject is fraught with prejudices magnified by decades of propaganda. My hopeis that people will reserve judgment while reading this book. They are free toconsider it as fiction, or as a slightly laborious thought experiment. I do notadvocate or suggest that anyone should violate any law, no matter how poorlyconceived, antithetical to human nature and dignity, or excessively punitivethat law might be. While undertaking this experiment, I have kept in mind acomment by the philosopher Jean-François Lyotard: “Being prepared to receivewhat thought is not prepared to think is what deserves the name of thinking.”Our society has not been prepared to think seriously about the possibility thatplants and even chemicals that transform consciousness might reveal an essentiallink between the human mind and the natural, and supernatural, world. It maywell be the case, as the late Terence McKenna wrote, that “the suppression ofthe natural human fascination with altered states of consciousness and thepresent perilous situation of all life on earth are intimately and casuallyconnected.” We have pursued frighteningly Faustian knowledge about the physicalworld without developing deeper awareness of our inner selves. If we don’t findsome means of correcting this imbalance, we may face the most dire consequences.Some might consider this book a provocation. It was not meant as one. What tookme to Gabon and Ecuador and into the inner recesses of my own psyche was ayearning for meaning and spiritual truth in a world that seemed devoid of both.The study of psychedelic shamanism encompasses a vast number of areas, frombotany to chemistry, from cultural history to mysticism. I am an expert in noneof them. All I can offer is a record of my own findings—it is, of necessity,incomplete, personal, and highly subjective.It is, from this vantage point, difficult to conceive that psychedelics mightever receive official sanction, or that the diabolical “War on Drugs” will evercome to an end. But who knows? Above all else, the psychedelic experiencecontinues to reveal, as it did a generation ago, that reality is far moremutable, capacious, and capricious than we generally allow ourselves to imagine."},{"pageContent":"[images/00005.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE KING OF THE BWITI[images/00006.jpg] “THE BWITI BELIEVE THAT BEFORE THE CEREMONY, THE NEOPHYTE ISNOTHING,” DANIEL LIEBERMAN TOLD ME ON MY FIRST MORNING IN GABON, AS WE TOOK ACAB FROM THE LIBREVILLE AIRPORT. “IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE INITIATION THAT YOUBECOME SOMETHING.”“WHAT DO YOU BECOME?” I ASKED.“YOU BECOME A BAANZI. ONE WHO KNOWS THE OTHER WORLD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN ITWITH YOUR OWN EYES.”“WHAT DO THE BWITI THINK OF IBOGA?” I ASKED.LIEBERMAN BARELY HESITATED. “FOR THEM, IBOGA IS A SUPER-CONSCIOUS SPIRITUALENTITY THAT GUIDES MANKIND,” HE SAID.“OKAY.”LIEBERMAN, AN ETHNOBOTANIST FROM SOUTH AFRICA, WANTED TO MAKE A BUSINESS OUT OFTAKING WESTERNERS THROUGH THE EXTREME BWITI INITIATION. I HAD FOUND HIM ON THEINTERNET. ON HIS WEBSITE HE POSTED PHOTOS FROM GABON THAT SEEMED UNREAL—TRIBALDANCERS IN GRASS SKIRTS, SMILING SHAMANS, AND IMAGES OF IBOGA ITSELF, A MODEST,EVEN UNASSUMING-LOOKING PLANT. THE BWITI’S BOTANICAL SACRAMENT, TABERNANTHEIBOGA, IS A BUSH THAT GROWS SMALL, EDIBLE ORANGE FRUIT THAT ARE TASTELESS ANDSTICKY. UNDER OPTIMUM CONDITIONS, IBOGA CAN GROW INTO A TREE THAT RISES FORTYFEET HIGH. THE HALLUCINATORY COMPOUND IS CONCENTRATED IN THE PLANT’S ROOTBARK,WHICH IS SCRAPED OFF, DRIED, AND SHREDDED INTO GRAY POWDER. FOR AN OUTSIDERCOMING FROM THE UNITED STATES, THE BWITI INITIATION COSTS OVER $7,000 WITH PLANETICKET, THE COST OF THE RITUAL, AND THE BOTANIST’S FEE. “I HAVE SPENT TIME INTHE RAIN FORESTS OF AFRICA EAST AND WEST, MADAGASCAR, AND THE AMAZON WORKINGWITH SHAMANS, BRUJOS, WITCH DOCTORS, HEALERS,” LIEBERMAN E-MAILED ME BEFORE THETRIP. “IBOGA I FEEL TO BE THE ONE PLANT THAT NEEDS TO BE INTRODUCED TO THEWORLD, AND URGENTLY.”IN PERSON, THE BOTANIST WAS THIN AND PALLID, WEARING TEVA SANDALS AND SAFARICLOTHES. HE SEEMED YOUNGER, LESS PROFESSIONAL, MORE ILL AT EASE THAN I HADEXPECTED. HE WAS AN ENTOMOLOGIST AS WELL AS A BOTANIST—LATER HE WOULD SHOW MEHUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS HE HAD TAKEN OF INSECTS IN THE AFRICAN RAIN FOREST. HESEEMED THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO WOULD BE HAPPIEST ALONE, TREKKING THROUGH A FORESTIN SEARCH OF RARE BEETLES AND BUTTERFLIES. HE TOLD ME HIS PALE COMPLEXION ANDTWITCHES APPEARED DURING A NEAR-FATAL BOUT OF CEREBRAL MALARIA. “I CAUGHT ITDURING A BWITI CEREMONY,” HE SAID. “IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO RECOVER.”I EXPECTED MY GUIDE TO BE ROBUST AND ADVENTUROUS. INSTEAD, AT THIRTY, HE TURNEDOUT TO BE TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME, AND SHAKIER. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE LASTTIME HE TOOK IBOGA, HE HAD BEEN SHOWN THE DATE OF HIS OWN DEATH, AND IT WASN’TTOO FAR AWAY. FROM THE SOMBER WAY HE SAID THIS, I KNEW HE BELIEVED IT WAS TRUE.I DIDN’T PRESS HIM FOR DETAILS—LATER I WISHED THAT I HAD.LIBREVILLE WAS HOT, STAGNANT, WITHOUT VITALITY. THE CITY SEEMED PRESSED UNDERGLASS. BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED OFF THE BLACK MIRRORS OF CORPORATE TOWERS,THE HEADQUARTERS OF OIL COMPANIES. BECAUSE OF ITS OIL DEPOSITS, GABON, A SMALLWEST AFRICAN COUNTRY ON THE EQUATOR, IS RICHER, MORE SECURE, THAN OTHERCOUNTRIES IN THE REGION. IBOGA IS ANOTHER NATURAL RESOURCE, BUT IT WILL NEVER BEEXPLOITED FOR EXPORT BY THE GABONESE. HALF THE POPULATION OF GABON BELONGS TOONE BWITI SECT OR ANOTHER. EVEN THE PRESIDENT-FOR-LIFE, OMAR BONGO, WHOSENEUTRAL AND UNINTERESTED VISAGE GAZED DOWN AT US FROM POSTERS AROUND TOWN, WASKNOWN TO BE AN INITIATE. THE BWITI SEEM TO TOLERATE FOREIGN INTEREST IN THEIRSACRED MEDICINE, BUT THEY DO NOT ENCOURAGE IT IN ANY WAY.“WHY WOULD THE BWITI ALLOW ME TO JOIN THEIR SECT?” I NOW ASKED.“BWITI IS LIKE BUDDHISM,” HE SAID. “ANYONE CAN JOIN IF THEY ARE WILLING TO BEINITIATED. THE WORD BWITI SIMPLY MEANS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE IBOGA PLANT, WHICHIS THE ESSENCE OF LOVE.”WHILE LIEBERMAN EQUATED BWITI WITH BUDDHISM, TO MOST OBSERVERS IT REMAINS ANENIGMATIC CULT. SOME SECTS OF BWITI, SUCH AS THE FANG, INCORPORATE ELEMENTS OFCHRISTIANITY, EVEN WEARING OSTENTATIOUS COSTUMES THAT RESEMBLE MARDI GRASVERSIONS OF THE VESTMENTS OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS AND NUNS. OTHER GROUPS, SUCH ASTHE ONE WE WERE VISITING, HOLD ON TO TRIBAL BELIEFS. JAMES FERNANDEZ, ANANTHROPOLOGIST WHO STUDIED THE SECT AT LENGTH, ENDED HIS BOOK BWITI: ANETHNOGRAPHY OF THE RELIGIOUS IMAGINATION IN AFRICA INCONCLUSIVELY: “IN THE END,ANY ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE THE COHERENCE OF THE BWITI COSMOS FOUNDERS UPON THEPARADOXES WITH WHICH IT PLAYS.” FOR FERNANDEZ, THE BWITI RELIGION WORKED BY“INDIRECTION AND SUGGESTION AND OTHER KINDS OF PUZZLEMENTS,” LEAVING “MANY LOOSEENDS AND INCONSISTENCIES.” IN THE TEXT, A TYPICALLY DISTANCED WORK OFANTHROPOLOGY, THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT FERNANDEZ HAD TRIED IBOGA HIMSELF.I KNEW THERE WAS ONE OTHER CUSTOMER FOR THIS JOURNEY. A WOMAN. I HAD FANTASIZED,IN ADVANCE, ABOUT HOOKING UP WITH SOME BRAVE AND BEAUTIFUL AUSTRALIAN HEIRESS ORYOUNG PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER. INSTEAD, TO MY DISMAY, I WAS INTRODUCED AT THEHOTEL TO ELAINE, A SHORT, TALKATIVE, MIDDLE-AGED JEWISH PSYCHOANALYST WITH AHEAVY NEW YORK ACCENT.“I JUST CAME FROM BHUTAN WHERE I GOT A TERRIBLE BLADDER INFECTION,” THE ANALYSTIMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED. “YOU’RE A NEW YORKER ALSO? WHAT A SURPRISE! I’M APSYCHOANALYST IN THE WEST VILLAGE. MAYBE YOU KNOW MY FRIEND WHO WORKS FOR THENEW YORK TIMES? OR MY SISTER, THE NOVELIST?”I NODDED AT THE FAMILIAR NAMES, TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK OF UNWANTEDFAMILIARITY. I HAD YEARNED FOR SOME SEVERE AND PRISTINE PURSUIT OF THE SACRED,THE EXOTIC “OTHER” ENCOUNTERED IN NOVELS OF JOSEPH CONRAD OR PAUL BOWLES.INSTEAD, I WOULD BE SHARING MY TRIBAL ADVENTURE WITH A WOMAN I MIGHT HAVE TRIEDTO AVOID AT A MANHATTAN COCKTAIL PARTY. I ADMIRED ELAINE’S COURAGE AND HERREASONS FOR TAKING THIS TRIP—SHE SAID THAT SOME OF HER PATIENTS ABUSED DRUGS,ESPECIALLY COKE, AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF SHE SHOULD RECOMMEND IBOGAINE TOTHEM. BUT HER PRESENCE ON MY JOURNEY SEEMED LIKE SOME CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATEDKARMIC PUNISHMENT.WE WENT TO MEET OUR SHAMAN, TSANGA JEAN MOUTAMBA, WHO CALLED HIMSELF “THE KINGOF THE BWITI.” WHAT WE WOULD LATER DISCOVER ABOUT THE KING’S BELLIGERENCE ANDGREED AND TYRANNICAL THEATRICALITY WAS NOT EVIDENT DURING THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER.AT HIS LIBREVILLE HOUSE, THE KING SEEMED GRUFF BUT BASICALLY FRIENDLY AS WE SETTHE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE TRIP. HIS PURPLE ROBE, AMPLE STOMACH, BUSHY GRAY BEARD,AND NECKLACE OF LION’S TEETH GAVE HIM THE LARGER-THAN-LIFE PRESENCE OF A 1960SAVANT-GARDE JAZZ MUSICIAN. WITH SHY SMILES, MEMBERS OF HIS HUGE FAMILY CAME TOSHAKE HANDS—WE WERE TOLD BY LIEBERMAN THAT HE HAD EIGHT WIVES AND FOURTEENCHILDREN, PLUS AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF BWITI INITIATES WHO CALLED HIM “PAPA.” THETRIBE PACKED OUR BAGS INTO A JEEP, AND THE KING HIMSELF DROVE US DOWN GABON’SSINGLE HIGHWAY, FOUR HOURS INTO THE DENSE JUNGLE, WHILE GREEN FOLIAGE UNFOLDEDMONOTONOUSLY UNDER A LEAD GRAY SKY. HE PLAYED A TAPE OF THE TWANGY, UNSETTLINGBWITI MUSIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON HIS TAPE RECORDER AS WE DROVE. THE MUSIC DIDNOT SOUND TRIBAL; TO ME IT HAD A SCI-FI QUALITY. WHEN WE STOPPED AT ONE OF THEFREQUENT MILITARY CHECKPOINTS, THE GUARDS WOULD TAKE ONE LOOK AT HIS LION’STOOTH NECKLACE AND WAVE US PAST.DURING MY TIME IN GABON, I KEPT TRYING TO FIND OUT THE MEANING OF MOUTAMBA’SSTATUS AS “LE ROI DU GABON BWITI,” AS THE HAND-PAINTED SIGN OUTSIDE HIS TRIBALVILLAGE PROUDLY PROCLAIMED. I RECEIVED DIFFERENT ANSWERS, SOMETIMES FROM THESAME PERSON. ALAIN DUKAGA, AN ENGLISH-SPEAKING GABONESE WITH A LIMP, WHO ACTEDAS OUR TRANSLATOR, FIRST TOLD ME: “MOUTAMBA IS LIKE JESUS TO US. MOST OF THEPEOPLE NOW ARE LIKE LACKING ROOTS. THEY GOT TIED TO THE CHRISTIAN WAYS ANDFORGOT THEIR CULTURE. MOUTAMBA IS HELPING TO BRING BACK OUR CULTURE. WE HOPESOON THEY WILL START TEACHING BWITI AGAIN IN THE SCHOOLS.” A FEW DAYS LATER,WHEN RELATIONS SOURED BETWEEN US AND OUR SHAMAN, ALAIN REVERSED HIMSELF.“MOUTAMBA?” HE SCOFFED. “HE’S NOT THE KING OF ANYTHING. HE JUST CALL HIMSELFTHAT.”IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN AFRICA, THE ONE CONTINENT I HAD NEVER WANTED TO VISIT.WHEN I THOUGHT OF AFRICA I THOUGHT OF VAST DISASTERS, CRUELTY ON A BIBLICALSCALE: FAMINES, TRIBAL WARS, INESCAPABLE POVERTY, DESPOTIC DICTATORSHIPS,EPIDEMICS OF AIDS AND EBOLA. IT WAS A CONTINENT WHERE FRIENDS OF MINE WENT TOPROVE THEMSELVES—WRITING JOURNALISM, PHOTOGRAPHING EXOTIC ATROCITIES, ACTING OUTHEMINGWAY-ESQUE SAFARI FANTASIES, JOINING THE PEACE CORPS, CONTRACTING BIZARREDISEASES. THE EBOLA VIRUS FIRST APPEARED IN THE FORESTS OF GABON. SOMETIMES IMUSED ON THE UNSETTLING NEAR-HOMOPHONY OF EBOLA AND IBOGA.MY TRIP SEEMED TO BE TEMPTING FATE. EVERY DETAIL OF IT GAVE ME AS MUCHRESISTANCE AS I COULD HANDLE. I HAD AN ASSIGNMENT TO WRITE ABOUT THE IBOGAINITIATION FOR VIBE MAGAZINE, BUT I ONLY RECEIVED THE MONEY I NEEDED A FEW DAYSBEFORE THE TRIP. AFTER PAYING OFF LIEBERMAN AND EVERYONE ELSE, MY BANK ACCOUNTWAS REDUCED TO A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE VISA I NEEDED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY—AFULL-PAGE PURPLE PASSPORT STAMP OF A MOTHER AND BABY—WAS HELD UP, FOR NO OBVIOUSREASON, AT THE GABONESE CONSULATE IN WASHINGTON. IT FINALLY ARRIVED AT MYAPARTMENT VIA FEDEX A FEW HOURS BEFORE MY DEPARTURE, INTERRUPTING MY FIT OFHYSTERICS. WHEN I REACHED CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS, I LEARNED THAT AIRFRANCE HAD CANCELED THEIR ONCE-A-WEEK FLIGHT TO LIBREVILLE, WHICH WAS SUPPOSEDTO LEAVE THAT NIGHT. AIR FRANCE GAVE ME 1,500 FRANCS IN CONSOLATION AND STASHEDME IN AN AIRPORT HOTEL FOR TWO NIGHTS, BEFORE THE NEXT DEPARTURE TO LIBREVILLE,ON AIR GABON. AT THE HOTEL, I ATE WITH A FEW ELEGANTLY DRESSED GABONESE PEOPLEWHO WERE ALSO STRANDED. THEY MOCKED THE WINE AND THE SERVICE IN RAPID-FIREFRENCH. I TOLD ONE OF THE MEN I WAS PLANNING TO VISIT THE BWITI. HE GAVE ME ASTRANGE LOOK. “LES BWITI, ILS SONT DANGEREUX,” HE SAID SOLEMNLY, QUICKLY TURNINGAWAY. I HAD NO WAY OF GETTING IN TOUCH WITH LIEBERMAN TO EXPLAIN THE DELAY; ICOULD ONLY HOPE HE WOULD STILL BE WAITING FOR ME WHEN I ARRIVED.IN RETROSPECT, AND EVEN AT THE TIME, IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THE DIFFICULTIESWERE A KIND OF TEST, AN ORDEAL PREPARED FOR ME BEFORE I COULD EVEN REACH THEORDEAL OF THE INITIATION. ALTHOUGH I WAS ANXIOUS, IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO TURNBACK.I WAS DRIVEN TO TRY IBOGA BY A YEARNING THAT WENT FAR DEEPER THAN THE DESIRE TOGET A GOOD STORY. I SAW THE ASSIGNMENT AS A MYSTICAL LOTTERY TICKET. I WASCOMMITTED TO THIS ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME LONG SHOT TO VISIT THE BWITI, TO ACCESSTHEIR SPIRIT WORLD. OR ANY SPIRIT WORLD."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2MAD TO BE SAVED[images/00006.jpg] MY INITIATION INTO THE BWITI CAME AT A TIME WHEN I WASLOSING INTEREST IN MYSELF. I FELT LIKE AN ACTOR WHO HAD LOST THE MOTIVATION FORHIS PART. OR I WAS LIKE THE CHARACTER OF “DANIEL PINCHBECK,” TRAPPED IN AHALF-FINISHED NOVEL THAT AN INCOMPETENT AUTHOR WAS IN THE SLUGGISH, SURLYPROCESS OF ABANDONING.I FELL INTO A SPIRITUAL CRISIS.I FELL, AND I COULD NOT GET UP.WANDERING THE STREETS OF THE EAST VILLAGE, I SPENT SO MUCH TIME CONTEMPLATINGTHE MEANINGLESSNESS OF EXISTENCE THAT I SOMETIMES FELT LIKE A GHOST. PERHAPS IAM ALREADY DEAD, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. THE WORLD SEEMED TO BE WRAPPED IN A COCOONI COULD NOT TEAR OPEN, AND I WAS SUFFOCATING IN IT. I DID NOT WANT WHAT OTHERPEOPLE WANTED, BUT I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO FIND WHAT I NEEDED. I WANTED TRUTH—MYOWN TRUTH, WHATEVER BLEAK FRAGMENT OF WHATEVER HELLISH TOTALITY IT MIGHT TURNOUT TO BE.THERE ARE REASONS WHY I, PARTICULARLY, GOT SUCKED INTO THIS SPIRITUAL VOID. WHENI LOOK BACK OVER MY LIFE, I CAN SEE THE OPEN JAWS OF THE ABYSS AWAITING ME.THROUGH MY MOTHER, JOYCE JOHNSON, A WRITER OF NOVELS AND MEMOIRS, I WAS LINKEDTO THE OFTEN MALIGNED AND SOMETIMES REVERED WRITERS OF THE BEAT GENERATION,FRANTIC IN THEIR PURSUIT OF MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE GLOBE (WHEN JACKKEROUAC WAS ON A TV TALK SHOW IN THE LATE 1950S, HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE WASLOOKING FOR. DRUNK AND DEFIANT, HE REPLIED, HONESTLY, “I AM WAITING FOR GOD TOSHOW ME HIS FACE.” AT THE TIME, MY POOR MOTHER, ALL OF TWENTY-TWO YEARS OLD, WASANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR HIM BACKSTAGE). MY MOTHER SENT MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT HERBEAT PAST. ON THE ONE HAND THE HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK QUOTE SHE DEDICATED TO MEWAS FROM ON THE ROAD: “MAD TO LIVE, MAD TO LOVE, MAD TO BE SAVED. . . .” YET THELIFE SHE SEEMED TO WANT ME TO LEAD WAS THAT OF A SHELTERED MIDDLE-CLASSINTELLECTUAL. SHE HAD SEEN TOO MANY FRIENDS DESTROYED BY BOHEMIAN EXCESSES,RUINED BY ALCOHOL OR SPEED.A SECOND REASON LIES IN MY PREPOSTEROUS LAST NAME, WHICH SOMETIMES FEELS LIKEWEARING A CLOWN’S RED NOSE. THE WORD CAN BE FOUND IN ANY GOOD DICTIONARY:“PINCHBECK” IS A TYPE OF FALSE GOLD. THIS SHINY ALLOY OF ZINC AND COPPER, STILLUSED IN COSTUME JEWELRY, WAS INVENTED BY CHRISTOPHER PINCHBECK, ANEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH ALCHEMIST WHO WAS ALSO A MAKER OF INTRICATEMECHANICAL CLOCKS FOR BRITISH ARISTOCRATS. LATER, THE DEFINITION OF “PINCHBECK”EXPANDED TO MEAN ANYTHING FALSE OR SPURIOUS—FOR INSTANCE, ACCORDING TO THEEXAMPLE IN ONE OLD DICTIONARY, “THE 19TH CENTURY WAS A PINCHBECK AGE OFLITERATURE.” JAMES JOYCE INCLUDED THE WORD IN ULYSSES. RECENTLY, WILLIAM SAFIRECHAMPIONED ITS REVIVAL.THIS SPURIOUS MONIKER HAS KEPT ME REMOTE, TO SOME EXTENT, FROM THE HARD FACTS OFEXISTENCE. BEHIND THE PINCHBECK FACADE, LIFE ALWAYS SEEMS SLIGHTLY ILLUSORY, ANALCHEMICAL AND IMPROBABLE PROCESS. PERHAPS I ALSO INHERITED MY ANCESTOR’S URGETO SEEK OUT WONDER, AS WELL AS MY FATHER’S YEARNING FOR TRANSCENDENCE, EXPRESSEDIN HIS ENORMOUS AND BROODING ABSTRACT PAINTINGS. IN THE QUEST DESCRIBED IN THISBOOK, I SUSPECT I AM WORKING THROUGH SOME BUSINESS LEFT OVER FROM MY HERITAGE,AS IF MYSTICAL YEARNINGS RUN, LIKE ROGUE GENES, IN FAMILY TREES.MY REFERENCE POINTS FOR A SPIRITUAL CRISIS WERE BOOKS AND AUTHORS—NAUSEA, NOTESFROM UNDERGOUND, THE STRANGER; KAFKA, BECKETT, RILKE—THE ELOQUENT DESPAIR OFTWENTIETH-CENTURY LITERATURE. AS I WANDERED THE STREETS IN A DESOLATE FUNK, IWOULD ASK MYSELF THE IMPOSSIBLE, THE EMBARRASSING, THE ULTIMATE CHILDISHQUESTION OF WHY?—WHY THIS CITY? WHY THIS LIFE? WHY ANYTHING? OF COURSE I KNEWTHAT “WHY” WAS A QUESTION YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STOP ASKING AROUND THE AGE OFTEN, BUT I COULDN’T FREE MYSELF FROM IT.I MOCKED MYSELF BY RECALLING A SEQUENCE FROM HANNAH AND HER SISTERS WHERE THECHARACTER PORTRAYED BY WOODY ALLEN FIRST LEARNS HE HAS A BRAIN TUMOR, THEN FINDSOUT HE DOESN’T HAVE ONE AFTER ALL, YET STILL REALIZES—NO MATTER HOW IMPROBABLEIT SEEMED BEFORE, WHEN HE WAS, LIKE MOST OF US, IN CHEERFUL DENIAL—HE WILL DIESOMEDAY. SUDDENLY OBSESSED WITH FINDING A MEANING TO LIFE, HE JOINS SEVERALRELIGIONS INCLUDING HARE KRISNA AND CATHOLICISM—FOR THE SKIT’S HIGH POINT, HEGOES TO THE SUPERMARKET TO BUY A LOAF OF WHITE WONDER BREAD AS A SIGN OF HIS NEWCHRISTIAN FAITH. IN THE END, HE RESOLVES HIS CRISIS AT A MARX BROTHERS DOUBLEFEATURE, REALIZING THAT LAUGHTER IS, IF NOT AN ANSWER, AT LEAST THE ONLY SOLACEHE CAN IMAGINE.I WAS IN A WORSE PLACE THAN WOODY ALLEN. I NEEDED SOME SOLACE BEYOND LAUGHTER.MY OPTIONS LOOKED PRETTY BAD.WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF MEDIA OVERLOAD AND DATA SMOG, WHERE EVERYTHING DISTRACTSUS FROM EVERYTHING ELSE. YET UNDERLYING THIS NOISY ASSAULT, OUR CULTURE OFFERSUS NOTHING TRANSCENDENT. NO DEEPER MEANING, NO ABIDING HOPE. IN MY CRISIS, EVERYFACET OF THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD SEEMED PART OF A DIABOLICAL MECHANISM CAREFULLYDESIGNED TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM WONDERING ABOUT THE REAL PURPOSE OF THEIR ENDLESSFRANTIC ACTIVITY.WHEN PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES SINKING INTO A SPIRITUAL CRISIS, MANY TURN TO THEESTABLISHED RELIGIONS OF CHRISTIANITY OR JUDAISM—OR BUDDHISM, OR SOME NEW AGECONSOLATION—TO HAUL THEMSELVES FROM THE DEPTHS. THIS WAS NOT AN OPTION FOR ME.MY PARENTS WERE ANTIRELIGION. MY MOTHER WAS JEWISH BY BIRTH BUT A COMMITTEDNONBELIEVER. EVEN MY GRANDMOTHER AND HER OLDER SISTERS, WHO HAD BEEN BORN INPOLAND, AVOIDED THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION. OUR SMALL FAMILY PASSOVER WAS A DINNERWITHOUT RITUAL OR PRAYER. MY FATHER, FORCED INTO BEING AN ALTAR BOY, HATEDCATHOLICISM AND SHUDDERED WHEN HE RECALLED THE PRIESTS WHO OPPRESSED HIM AS ACHILD. ANYWAY, I HAD NO INTEREST IN RECEIVED WISDOM OR TRADITIONAL FAITH. IWANTED INSPIRATION OF MY OWN, INNER KNOWLEDGE.RALPH WALDO EMERSON IS ONE OF THOSE WRITERS WE STUDY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THENFORGET. WHEN I ENCOUNTERED HIS ESSAYS AS AN ADULT, I REALIZED HE WAS SPEAKING TOME: “WHY SHOULD NOT WE ALSO ENJOY AN ORIGINAL RELATION TO THE UNIVERSE?” EMERSONASKED. “WHY SHOULD NOT WE HAVE A POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY OF INSIGHT AND NOT OFTRADITION, AND A RELIGION BY REVELATION TO US, AND NOT THE HISTORY OF THEIRS?”THAT WAS WHAT I DEMANDED, “AN ORIGINAL RELATION TO THE UNIVERSE.” NOTHINGABSTRACT, SECONDHAND, OR SECOND-RATE. NO HISTORY OF SOMEBODY ELSE’STRANSCENDENCE. WHY SHOULD NOT I ALSO ENJOY IT? WHY DID IT SEEM SUCH ANIMPOSSIBLE GOAL?MY PARENTS WERE PART OF THE BEAT AND ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST UPSURGE OF THEFIFTIES AND SIXTIES. A GENERATION LATER, I WATCHED THE WRECKING BALL OF ECONOMICDETERMINISM DESTROY THE REMNANTS OF THEIR LIBERAL, IDIOSYNCRATIC CULTURE—THEQUAINT, SLOW-MOTION WORLD OF ANTIQUATED CAFES, OLD REVIVAL HOUSES, INDEPENDENTBOOKSTORES. THROUGH THE 1990S, NEW YORK TRANSFORMED FROM A CITY WHERE CULTUREAND COMMERCE LIVED TOGETHER SYMBIOTICALLY INTO A COMMERCIAL CENTER WHERE ARTISTSCLUNG TO THE MARGINS. THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO LONGER ANYTHING LIKE A REDEMPTIVE“HIGH CULTURE” TO PROVIDE A BRAKE ON THE CAPITALIST JUGGERNAUT.I FELT AS IF I WERE BECOMING A GHOST, A DISEMBODIED SURVIVOR FROM SOME DISTANTEPOCH. I REALIZED THAT IF THIS MONOTONOUS MATERIALIST CULTURE WAS “THE END OFHISTORY,” AS SOME WRITERS PROCLAIMED—WITHOUT SPIRITUAL REALITY, WITHOUT ACCESSTO ANY OTHER LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR MEANING—THEN LIFE FOR ME WAS ALMOSTINTOLERABLE.AT A LOW POINT, I RECALLED ILLICIT ILLUMINATIONS RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN DRIEDBITS OF CHEWY FUNGUS AND TINY PAPER SQUARES I HAD LAST EATEN IN COLLEGE. MOST OFALL, I REMEMBERED MY ENCOUNTERS WITH PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOMS. WHAT I RECALLED WASTHE SENSORY GLOW—THE EXPANSION OF COLORS, SOUNDS, SMELLS. IT HAD BEEN AREVELATION—HOW THE VEILS OF ABSTRACTION SUDDENLY SEEMED TO FALL AWAY FROM MYMIND. AT THE TIME, MUSHROOMS CUT THROUGH MY PAINFUL FEELINGS OF POSTADOLESCENTALIENATION, ALTHOUGH THEY SOMETIMES MAGNIFIED MY DEEPEST ANXIETIES.WHILE TRIPPING, I FELT HOW I WAS EMBEDDED IN THE SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSESTHAT WERE SPUN LIKE THE INTRICATE FILAMENTS OF A SPIDER’S WEB ALL AROUND ME. THEWORLD RETURNED TO THE STATUS OF AN ORIGINAL MYSTERY, BUT NOTHING WAS MOREBIZARRE THAN MY OWN CONSCIOUSNESS, MY PLACE IN THE STRUCTURE OF ALL I COULD SEEAND SENSE AND KNOW.I STARTED EXPERIMENTING WITH MUSHROOMS AND LSD AGAIN. AT FIRST, FINDING THESEDRUGS WAS A SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN NEW YORK. HEROIN AND COCAINE WEREEASILY AVAILABLE ON ANY NUMBER OF STREET CORNERS, BUT PSYCHEDELICS REQUIREDSERIOUS EFFORT AND RESEARCH. ONCE SUPPLIED, I TOOK THEM AT HOME, IN PARKS, ANDBEFORE VISITING GRUNGY EAST VILLAGE BARS. ON MUSHROOMS, A FRIEND AND I PERCEIVEDMAX FISH, A BAR ON LUDLOW STREET, TO BE A MEDIEVAL PUB, FULL OF WOUNDED KNIGHTSAND CRIPPLED PLAGUE VICTIMS, SCOUNDRELS, AND WASTRELS. I TOOK A STRONG DOSE OFLSD WITH ANOTHER FRIEND IN MY APARTMENT ON AVENUE B IN THE EAST VILLAGE. WEWATCHED, AMAZED, AS MUSIC GENERATED RAINBOW SHIMMERS AND OUR WORDS TURNED INTOSTAINED-GLASS PICTURES BEFORE OUR EYES. THE ACID TEMPORARILY WIPED OUT MYIDENTITY. I KNEW I HAD CHOSEN TO PERFORM SOME TYPE OF EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF, BUTI COULDN’T RECALL MY OWN NAME. THIS WAS INTERESTING RATHER THAN THREATENING—INANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TERRIFYING. AS THE WALLS TREMBLED LIKERUNNING WATERCOLORS, I ASKED MY FRIEND, “DID I, AT SOME POINT EARLIER THISEVENING, TAKE A DRUG THAT ALTERED MY MIND?”A YEAR LATER, I TRIED THE AMAZONIAN JUNGLE DRUG AYAHUASCA—THE LEGENDARYSUBSTANCE, ALSO KNOWN AS YAGÉ, THAT WILLIAM BURROUGHS PURSUED THROUGH SOUTHAMERICA IN THE EARLY 1950S, SEEKING A VISIONARY CURE FOR HIS HEROIN ADDICTION.CUPS OF THE DRUG WERE DOLED OUT AT A $200 CEREMONY IN A DOWNTOWN APARTMENT,ORGANIZED BY A COUPLE FROM CALIFORNIA. BEFORE DRINKING, WE WERE GIVEN ADULTDEPENDS DIAPERS TO WEAR, AND PLASTIC BUCKETS FOR VOMITING. THE SOUR POTIONPRODUCED A FEW STARTLING INSIGHTS AND IMAGES—EMERALD-GREEN VINES WAVERING INFRONT OF A WATERFALL—AND HOURS OF NAUSEA. ONE WOMAN GROANED AND RETCHED FORHOURS AS THE NEW AGE SHAMANS SHOOK RATTLES AND FEATHERS AROUND HER. IT SOUNDEDLIKE SHE WAS VOMITING OUT HER VERY BEING. HER SICKNESS KEPT ME FROM MY OWN INNERJOURNEY.THE AYAHUASCA TRIP, WHILE INTRIGUING, LEFT ME DEEPLY UNSATISFIED. MY ABILITY TOHAVE VISIONS SEEMED EXTREMELY MEAGER. A HARDHEAD, I LACKED THE CAPACITY TO“HALLUCINATE.” EVEN MY DREAMS WERE MEAGER GRAY VOIDS. I WONDERED IF MY INTENSEDESIRE TO REACH THE VISIONARY STATE STEMMED FROM SOME INTRINSIC PHYSICAL FLAW.MOST OF MY FRIENDS DISMISSED MY NEW ENTHUSIASM. PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS WERE WEIRD ANDCHILDISH, SOMETHING YOU DID IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE AND GOT OVER. YOU TRIEDTHEM A BUNCH OF TIMES, HAD SOME FREAKY TRIPS, THEN MOVED ON TO THE ADULTLUBRICATORS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION—BOOZE, COKE, VALIUM, POT, HEROIN. HEROIN,ABOVE ALL, WAS THE DOWNTOWN HIPSTER INTOXICANT OF CHOICE. OVER A DECADE, I KNEWAT LEAST HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE—BRIGHT, ARTISTIC, CONFUSED—WHO DIED FROM OVERDOSES.COMPARED TO THESE HIPSTER INTOXICANTS, MUSHROOMS AND LSD WERE SEEN AS SILLY,SOMEHOW REGRESSIVE, OR WEAK. IN MY CROWD, EVEN ECSTASY WAS NOT POPULAR—ONLYALCOHOL IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS, THEN HEROIN AND COKE, AND SOMETIMES THE VOLATILEMIXTURE OF THE THREE. WHILE I TOOK THOSE SUBSTANCES IN SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, INEVER FELT THE SLIGHTEST COMPULSION ABOUT THEM. I NEVER TOUCHED THEM WHEN I WASALONE.I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IBOGA AT BLACK OUT BOOKS, AN ANARCHIST BOOKSTORE ON AVENUEB. THE CLERK SHOWED ME A BOOK ON THE IBOGAINE PROJECT, A TWENTY-YEAR EFFORT TOBRING ATTENTION TO A RARE AFRICAN HALLUCINOGEN PURPORTED TO HAVE A MIRACULOUSEFFECT ON HEROIN AND COCAINE ADDICTION. IBOGAINE, I LEARNED, WAS AN UNDERGROUNDLEGEND FOR ITS ANTIADDICTIVE POWERS. THIS PROPERTY WAS DISCOVERED IN THE EARLY1960S BY HOWARD LOTSOFF. LOTSOFF WAS A YOUNG ADDICT WHEN HE READ ABOUT THEAFRICAN BARK SOMEWHERE, OBTAINED THE POWDER THROUGH A MAIL-ORDER CATALOG, ANDTOOK IT FOR EXTRA KICKS. INSTEAD OF AN ADDED HIGH, HE WAS SENT ON A STERN ANDSOMBER TOUR OF HIS ENTIRE PAST. FINDING THE TRIP UNPLEASANT, HE TRIED TO SHAKEOUT OF IT BY TAKING A WALK. CROSSING A STREET AT ONE POINT, HE LOOKED BACK ANDSAW SEVEN COPIES OF HIMSELF, FREEZE-FRAMED, CROSSING THE STREET BEHIND HIM. ATTHE END OF THE TRIP, HE FOUND HE HAD LOST INTEREST IN HEROIN, AS WELL AS ANYDESIRE FOR IT—AN INADVERTENT AND NOT EVEN DESIRED SIDE EFFECT. LOTSOFF WENT ONWITH HIS LIFE BUT NEVER FORGOT THIS EPISODE. DECADES LATER, HE PATENTED THEIBOGA MOLECULE UNDER THE NAME OF IBOGAINE, SPECIFICALLY FOR USE IN TREATING DRUGADDICTION. AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF EFFORT, LOTSOFF HAD FAILED TO GET HISTREATMENT LEGALIZED.IF THIS WERE ALL TRUE, THEN THE MYTHIC DIMENSIONS OF THE IBOGAINE STORY WEREFASCINATING: A PLANT FROM EQUATORIAL AFRICA (THE ARCHAIC BIRTHPLACE OF HUMANITY)THAT CURED ADDICTION (THE MODERN SCOURGE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE INNERCITIES OF THE UNITED STATES) BY SENDING ADDICTS ON A LONG PSYCHEDELIC TRIP (AVOYAGE INTO AN ARCHAIC SPIRITUAL DIMENSION WHOSE EXISTENCE IS DISMISSED BYMODERN “RATIONALITY”).I PERSONALLY DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF A “SPIRIT WORLD.”STILL, I WANTED TO TRY IT FOR MYSELF."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3YOU WANT TO CHEAT ME?[images/00006.jpg] WE DROVE TO THE KING’S VILLAGE, FORTY KILOMETERS OF DIRTROAD AND RED DUST–COVERED JUNGLE AWAY FROM LAMBARÉNÉ, THE RIVERSIDE TOWN WHEREALBERT SCHWEITZER HAD HIS HOSPITAL. MOUTAMBA’S HOMESTEAD WAS A COMPOUND OFMODEST BUILDINGS IN A JUNGLE CLEARING. CHILDREN, HENS, AND ROOSTERS WANDEREDFREELY AROUND DIRT PATHS AND CHAOTIC PATCHES OF GARDEN. ONE ROOFLESS STRUCTUREDECORATED WITH PALM FRONDS WAS THE PYGMY HOUSE, HONORING THE REGION’S NATIVEINHABITANTS FOR DISCOVERING LE BOIS SACRÉ, “THE SACRED WOOD,” ANOTHER NAME FORIBOGA.ACCORDING TO LEGEND, THE PYGMIES USED IBOGA FOR CENTURIES BEFORE THEY GAVE THESECRET OF THE PLANT TO THE NEIGHBORING BANTU TRIBES WHO KEPT ATTACKING THEM,FORCING THEM DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE. THE PYGMIES SHOWED THEIR ENEMIES HOW TO USEIBOGA SO THEY WOULD DISCOVER THEIR PLACE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD. THE PYGMIES KNEWTHAT ONCE THE BANTUS MADE THAT DISCOVERY, THEY WOULD LOSE INTEREST IN WAGINGWARS. IF THAT WAS THE PLAN, IT WORKED: GABON REMAINS THE ONLY PEACEFUL COUNTRYIN A REGION OF INESCAPABLE HOSTILITY, TRIBAL CONFLICTS, MINDLESS GENOCIDES. THECULT OF BWITI MAY BE THE REASON FOR ITS PACIFISM.THE PYGMIES STILL LIVE IN SMALL BANDS IN GABON’S MOST INACCESSIBLE JUNGLES.THEORETICALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A PYGMY INITIATION. I WILL HAVE TO SAVETHAT ADVENTURE FOR ANOTHER TRIP. OR MORE LIKELY A FUTURE LIFE.THE STONE WALLS OF THE TEMPLE WERE PAINTED WITH CRUDE PORTRAITS OF MOUTAMBA’SANCESTORS. A WOODEN STATUE OF THE ORIGINAL BWITI COUPLE STOOD AT THE ENTRYWAY.IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, GABONESE WOOD-CARVERS WERE RENOWNED FOR THEIR SKILL,BUT THEIR ARTISANSHIP DEGENERATED AFTER THE FRENCH COLONIAL OCCUPATION AND THEOIL BOOM, AND THIS STATUE WAS OF POOR QUALITY. I GAVE THE SCULPTURE A CAREFULLOOK. THE FIGURES WERE CRUDE AND UNCUDDLY, SQUARED OFF AND DARK. A SMALL IBOGAPLANT SPROUTED UP BETWEEN THEIR LEGS. BEFORE ARRIVING IN GABON, I READ ACCOUNTSOF WESTERNERS TAKING IBOGA—THERE WERE QUITE A FEW REPORTS POSTED ON THEINTERNET. THE BWITI VERSION OF ADAM AND EVE, THE CULT’S ARCHAIC FATHER ANDMOTHER, OFTEN APPEARED IN IBOGA VISIONS, EVEN SHOWING THEMSELVES TO PEOPLE WHOKNEW NOTHING ABOUT BWITI BEFORE TAKING IT. I HOPED THEY WOULD APPEAR TO ME.WE STAYED AT THE VILLAGE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CEREMONY. THE ANALYST, THEBOTANIST, THE KING, AND I SLEPT IN THE TEMPLE ON MATTRESSES UNDER MOSQUITO NETS,ALONG WITH VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE. PEOPLE CAME AND WENT THROUGHOUT THENIGHT. LIZARDS SKITTERED ACROSS THE TIN CEILING. A SMALL CHILD ARRIVED ANDNESTLED CLOSE TO ME. WHEN WE AWOKE, THE KING GAVE US WHAT THE BWITI CALL LALISTE, THE TRADITIONAL ROSTER OF THINGS NEOPHYTES BUY FOR THE RITUAL. LA LISTEINCLUDED A MIRROR, A TIN BUCKET, A RED PARROT’S FEATHER, YARDS OF FABRIC,CANDLES AND COPAL INCENSE, A MACHETE, A WOVEN MAT, AND SUPPLIES FOR THE NEXTDAY’S FEAST FOR THE TRIBE—A LIVE COQ DU VILLAGE, AND A LARGE QUANTITY OF SWEETLIQUORS SUCH AS RUM AND CASSIS. THE ANALYST, THE GUIDE, AND I SPENT THE MORNINGDRIVING AROUND THE MARKET STALLS OF LAMBARÉNÉ WITH THREE OF THE KING’S SONS,WHOSE UNSMILING SEVERITY AS THEY ASSISTED US MADE ME CONSCIOUS OF THE SERIOUSNATURE OF THE CEREMONY. EVERYWHERE WE WENT IN THE VIRTUALLY ALL-BLACK TOWNSHIP,PEOPLE PEERED INTO OUR CAR WITH CURIOSITY, AND THE TIGHT-LIPPED BWITI CLANSEEMED PROUD TO PARADE LES BLANCS AROUND LIKE EXOTIC TROPHIES.ON THE WAY BACK TO THE VILLAGE, THE JEEP KICKED UP CLOUDS OF THE RED DUST THATCOVERED THE PALMS AND BANANA PLANTS ALONG THE DIRT ROAD. SITTING NEXT TO AJET-BLACK YOUNG MAN WITH A LONG KNIFE AT HIS BELT, THE ANALYST WAS CHATTERINGNERVOUSLY, TALKING NONSTOP. THE BOTANIST ADMITTED HE DIDN’T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.THE ANALYST TOLD HIM HOW TO IMPROVE HIS LOVE LIFE. SHE SAID HE SHOULD MOVE TONEW YORK AND TAKE OUT SOME PERSONAL ADS.“LATELY MY FRIEND MARK HAS MET SO MANY WONDERFUL MEN THROUGH THE NEW YORK REVIEWOF BOOKS,” SHE SHOUTED OVER THE WIND.THE BWITI STARED SILENTLY INTO THE JUNGLE.. . .WHEN WE RETURNED, THE KING CALLED US TO THE TEMPLE. “IT WAS GOOD YOU STAYED HERELAST NIGHT.” HE SMILED BROADLY, FLASHING WHITE TEETH. “LAST NIGHT, I DREAMT THATLE JOURNALISTE”—HE POINTED AT ME—“WILL HAVE MANY WONDERFUL VISIONS. NOW IT ISTIME. YOU MUST GIVE US THE REST OF THE MONEY.”THIS WAS A SURPRISE. WE HAD ALREADY HANDED OVER THE AGREED-UPON $600 FOR THECEREMONY, AT LEAST DOUBLE THE FEE PAID BY THE AVERAGE GABONESE. WE REMINDED HIMOF THIS, BUT THE KING STARTED SHOUTING.“YOU WANT TO CHEAT ME?” HE DEMANDED ANOTHER $600 FROM EACH OF US. OUR GUIDETRIED TO BARGAIN WITH HIM, BUT LIEBERMAN SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE AUTHORITY AMONGTHE BWITI. THE ARGUMENT WENT ON FOR HOURS. MOUTAMBA RAGED AT US, SHOUTED HISDEMAND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HE WOULD GO AWAY FOR A WHILE, THEN RETURN TO SCREAMSOME MORE. THE YOUNG MEN OF THE TRIBE STARED AT US COLDLY, AS IF THEY WERESHOCKED WE WOULD CHALLENGE THE KING’S AUTHORITY.LATER I LEARNED THAT SHAMANS TEND TO BE TRICKY WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS OFPAYMENT: IT IS TOUGH TO SET A PRICE TAG ON TRANSCENDENCE. DURING AN INTERVALWHEN THE KING STOPPED YELLING AT US, HE APPROACHED ME THROUGH ALAIN, THETRANSLATOR. I WAS TOLD THAT, IN THE FUTURE, THEY DIDN’T WANT TO WORK WITH THEBOTANIST ANYMORE. “YOU YOURSELF SHOULD BRING MORE AMERICANS TO HIM FORINITIATION.” I SAID I WOULD SEE WHAT I COULD DO.LIEBERMAN KEPT ASSURING US THE BWITI WERE PACIFIST, BUT THE SITUATION SEEMED OUTOF CONTROL. HE CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER IT. LIEBERMAN’S EXTENSIVEWEBSITE GAVE THE IMPRESSION HE HAD LED NUMEROUS PEOPLE THROUGH THE BWITICEREMONY. WHEN I ACTUALLY QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT IT, I LEARNED HE HAD BROUGHT ONLYONE OTHER CUSTOMER TO THE KING, A DUTCH COMPUTER PROGRAMMER. THE DUTCHMAN LOSTHIS NERVE BEFORE THE INITIATION, SWALLOWED A FISTFUL OF TRANQUILIZERS, AND DIDNOT EAT ANY IBOGA. LIEBERMAN HAD ALSO TOLD US THAT MOUTAMBA HAD INITIATED MANYOUTSIDERS. THE KING PRESENTED US A LARGE LEDGER FOR FOREIGNERS TO SIGN BEFORETHE CEREMONY. THERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER NAMES IN THE BOOK’S YELLOWING PAGES.WE DID NOT FEEL SAFE; LATER ON THE ANALYST TOLD ME SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SOTERRIFIED IN HER LIFE. WE WERE COMPLETELY IN THEIR POWER. WHILE THE KING RANTEDTHAT WE HAD CHEATED THEM OUT OF MONEY, ALL OF OUR BELONGINGS, OUR BAGS ANDPASSPORTS AND WALLETS, WERE STASHED IN ONE OF THEIR UNLOCKED HOUSES. DURING ONEMEETING WITH THE KING AND HIS RETINUE, A HUNTING RIFLE LAY ON THE TABLE IN FRONTOF THEM. AS THE KING SCREAMED AT US, ONE OF HIS SONS CAREFULLY CLEANED IT, THENLOADED IT UP.“I’M NOT SURE I LIKE THE POWER DYNAMICS I SEE HERE,’’ THE ANALYST WHISPERED TOME.WHILE THE ANALYST HAD EARLIER SEEMED A KARMIC CURSE, I NOW CONSIDERED HER AGOOD-LUCK CHARM. IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO IMAGINE MYSELF AND THE BOTANIST BURNED ATTHE STAKE BY ANGRY BWITI WHO FELT WE WERE RUINING THEIR RITUAL—WE WERE TWOPALE-FACED SAD SACKS DESPERATE TO KNOW THE TRIBAL MYSTERIES—BUT IT WASIMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY WOULD HURT THE ANALYST. WITH HER “FREE TIBET’’ T-SHIRT,PATAGONIA PANTS, BUG-EYED GLASSES, AND INCESSANT CHATTER, SHE HAD A CURIOUSQUALITY OF INDESTRUCTIBILITY.FINALLY IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE INITIATION WOULD PROCEED EVEN THOUGH WE HADCHEATED THEM. AT THE END OF THE RITUAL, HOWEVER, THE KING WOULD NOT GIVE US THESPECIAL OIL THAT BESTOWS A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR VISIONS THROUGH THE YEAR.“HE HIMSELF WILL NOT WALK WITH YOU INTO THE FOREST AND EXPLAIN TO YOU THE MYTHOF THE BWITI, THE ORIGIN OF THE PLANTS,’’ ALAIN TRANSLATED. NOW MOUTAMBA’S TRIBESEEMED TO REGARD US WITH CONTEMPT. BWITI NO LONGER SEEMED QUITE THE “ESSENCE OFLOVE’’ LIEBERMAN HAD DESCRIBED.. . .IT WAS ALMOST DUSK. I WAS TOLD TO SIT ALONE IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE. AS NIGHTFELL, THE MEN OF THE BWITI CAME TO ME. THEY WERE AN IMPRESSIVE SIGHT. THEY HADCHANGED FROM THEIR EVERYDAY JEANS AND T-SHIRTS INTO TRIBAL DRESS. LIMBS ANDTORSOS BARE, THEY WORE ANIMAL PELTS AND LOINCLOTHS, WITH ARMBANDS AND NECKLACESMADE FROM SHELLS AND FEATHERS. THEIR JET-BLACK SKIN WAS PAINTED WITH WHITESTRIPES AND DOTS.WE WALKED IN SINGLE FILE, AWAY FROM THE SIMPLE WOODEN HOUSES OF THE VILLAGE,TAKING A PATH THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO THE BANKS OF A SMALL STREAM. AMONG THEBWITI, I FELT ABSURDLY SELF-CONSCIOUS: I KNEW I WAS NOT A PERSON TO THEM SO MUCHAS AN ARCHETYPE. TO THE BWITI, I WAS A WHITE GHOST, A PALE INTERLOPER FROM THECOLONIAL WORLD SEEKING TO RETURN TO THE SPIRITUAL SOURCE. I WANTED TO LAUGH—THEINITIATION SEEMED LIKE AN ACT OF INSANE HUBRIS ON MY PART.SOME OF THE MEN HELD TORCHES. OTHERS PLAYED DRUMS AND RATTLES AND HORNS IN AWEIRDLY HUMOROUS MARCH. THE YOUNG MEN OF THE TRIBE HAD THE SLEEK AND MUSCULARBODIES OF HUNTERS. WHITE-PAINTED PATTERNS GLOWED LIKE NEON ON THEIR BODIES INTHE FLICKERING FLAMES.MOUTAMBA, WRAPPED IN A LEOPARD SKIN, ORDERED ME TO UNDRESS COMPLETELY AND STEPINTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM. AS I SHIVERED IN THE ICY WATER, THE YOUNG MANASSIGNED TO BE MY “BWITI FATHER” POURED A SOAPY LIQUID OVER ME—A PROTECTIVESPIRIT-MEDICINE. HE SMEARED A ROUGH RED PASTE ACROSS MY FACE AND TORSO. THEBWITI SANG WHILE I PUT ON THE INITIATE’S OUTFIT—STRAPS OF TANNED ANIMAL SKINSAND SHELLS LOOPING ACROSS MY CHEST AND UPPER ARMS, A SHORT RED TUNIC. A REDFEATHER WAS TWIRLED IN MY HAIR.IT WAS TIME TO BEGIN EATING THE IBOGA."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4TOUCHERS TEACH TOO[images/00006.jpg] THE KING RAISED UP THE PLANTAIN WITH TWO HANDS. MY BWITIFATHER CARRIED THIS SACRAMENT TO ME GINGERLY WHILE THE OTHERS WATCHED. I LOOKEDAT THE FRUIT HELD TO MY LIPS; IT HAD BEEN SPLIT OPEN AND FILLED WITH THE GRAYFLECKS OF IBOGA POWDER. THE BWITI MEN ON THE HILLSIDE SANG AND DRUMMED ADIRGELIKE MELODY. BY CASTING OFF MY CLOTHES AND PUTTING ON THE RED ROBE OF THEINITIATE, I HAD SYMBOLICALLY DIED. AFTER EATING THE DRY POWDER, I WOULD BEREBORN.FOR YEARS AFTER, WHENEVER I RECALLED THE FLAVOR OF IBOGA, I SHUDDERED WITHDISGUST. THE POWDER TASTED LIKE SAWDUST LACED WITH BATTERY ACID—IT WAS ENTIRELYREVOLTING, THE MOST BITTER SUBSTANCE I EVER PUT INTO MY MOUTH. WORSE YET, THEPLAINTAIN WAS DRY AND HARD AND EACH BITE REQUIRED EXTENSIVE CHEWING. MY TONGUEBECAME DRY AND SWOLLEN, MY THROAT GAGGED AS IT TRIED TO REJECT THE VILE STUFF.AFTER I FINISHED THE PLAINTAIN, I WAS FED A FEW MORE SPOONFULS OF THE DRUG MIXEDWITH HONEY. THE SHAMAN NODDED ENCOURAGINGLY. I FOUGHT TO KEEP THE STUFF DOWN.“LE JOURNALISTE A MANGÉ BEAUCOUP, BEAUCOUP,” HE SAID.WE RETURNED TO THE VILLAGE. MY LEGS HAD TURNED RUBBERY AND I FELT QUEASY. IN THEMAIN COURTYARD, A FEW OF THE MEN SAT AROUND ME, PLAYING DRUMS. ONE OF THEMSTRUMMED THE M’CONGO, A ONE-STRINGED MOUTH HARP RESEMBLING A BOW, WHICH HAS THEEERIE TONALITY OF A MOCKING VOICE. I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE M’CONGO CHANNELS THEVOICES OF THE BWITI ANCESTORS. THEY PUT A BUNDLE OF LEAVES IN MY RIGHT HAND ANDA WHISK OF DRY THISTLES IN MY LEFT AND TOLD ME TO KEEP SHAKING BOTH IN TIME TOTHE MUSIC. THIS MECHANICAL GESTURE WOULD HELP TO STEADY ME THROUGHOUT THEVISIONS. THE BWITI WERE STRICT ABOUT THIS RULE; WHENEVER I STOPPED SHAKING THERATTLES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, A TRIBESMAN WOULD RUSH UP TO ME AND FORCE ME TOCONTINUE.THEY FED ME MORE IBOGA AND BROUGHT ME, SHUDDERING, INTO THE TORCH-LIT TEMPLE. IWAS UNBALANCED, CONFUSED. THEY SAT ME ALONE AT THE CENTER, IN FRONT OF MYMIRROR, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY FERN LEAVES AND CARVED FIGURINES. THE KING ANDTHE TRIBAL ELDERS SAT TO MY LEFT, AND THE REST OF THE TRIBE WAS ON BENCHES TO MYRIGHT, PERHAPS THIRTY PEOPLE IN ALL.THE ANALYST WAS TELLING HER VISIONS, WHICH SEEMED TO BE POURING INTO HER. SHELAY ALONG A WALL OF THE TEMPLE SURROUNDED BY BWITI WOMEN WHO MURMUREDSUPPORTIVELY AS SHE RECOUNTED WHAT SHE SAW.“THERE’S BUDDHA,” ELAINE SAID, POINTING AT THE CEILING. SHE TURNED AROUND. “ANDI SEE MY DEAD GRANDMA OVER THERE.” SHE WAVED AT THE WALL. “HELLO, GRANDMA.”AROUND ME, THE ATMOSPHERE WAS TENSE. THE KING HAD DECREED I WOULD HAVE“WONDERFUL VISIONS.” I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT NOT SATISFYING HIM WAS NOT ANOPTION.A LONG TIME PASSED, AND NOTHING HAPPENED.IN THE MIRROR, I SAW MY FACE CHANGE SHAPE. I SEEMED TO AGE, LINES AND WRINKLESSPREAD ACROSS MY SKIN. THEN I APPEARED YOUNGER, MY FEATURES SMOOTHING OUT,IMPACTING INTO THE SCRUNCHED FACE OF A BABY. THESE EFFECTS FLUCTUATED, LASTING AFEW INSTANTS. THEN I WAS STARING AT MYSELF AGAIN, A BEWILDERED PALE FACE INTORTOISESHELL GLASSES AND TRIBAL OUTFIT.“I DON’T SEE ANYTHING,” I SAID TO THE IMPATIENT TRIBESMEN WATCHING ME.FINALLY, OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE, I HAD MY FIRST VISION: A LARGE WOODENSTATUE, A DARK AND FACELESS GOLEMLIKE FIGURE FORMED OUT OF ROUGH LOGS, WALKEDACROSS THE ROOM AND SAT ON THE BENCH. CROSSING ITS LEGS, IT LEANED FORWARD, ASIF TO WATCH ME WITH INTEREST. THE VISION HAPPENED QUICKLY. IT SEEMED UTTERLYREAL. A MOMENT LATER, A TINY SCREEN OPENED IN THE MIRROR’S SCRATCHED, POCKMARKEDSURFACE. ON THAT SCREEN I LOOKED INTO THE WINDOW OF MY MANHATTAN APARTMENT.THROUGH THE HANGING PLANTS, I SAW INTO MY LIVING ROOM, WHICH WAS EMPTY. THEN IWATCHED CROWDS CROSSING A BROADWAY INTERSECTION, HOLDING UMBRELLAS IN THE RAIN.THE IMAGES WERE GHOST IMPRESSIONS IN SHADES OF GRAY, LIKE IMAGES FROM AN OLDMOVIE; THEY WERE CLEAR, TOTALLY DISTINCT, BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT. WHEN I TRIED TOSTUDY THEM, THEY WAVERED AND DISAPPEARED.“IF YOU SEE A WINDOW YOU MUST TRY TO GO THROUGH IT,” THE KING INSTRUCTED METHROUGH THE TRANSLATOR, “AND IF YOU MEET SOMEBODY THERE YOU MUST TRY TO TALK TOTHEM. PERHAPS THEY HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU, SOME INFORMATION.”THE BWITI KEPT INSISTING I SHOULD RELATE MY VISIONS OUT LOUD. I WAS NOT READYFOR THAT. I HAD EXPECTED WHATEVER I SAW TO BE MY OWN CONCERN. BUT THE BWITIDIDN’T SYMPATHIZE WITH MY WESTERN IDEAS OF PRIVACY. “EVERYTHING YOU SEE MUST BESHARED,” THE KING URGED. “YOU MIGHT HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE TRIBE, SOMEINFORMATION.” IN MY STONED STATE I WAS TONGUE-TIED, AND I SENSED THE BWITI’SRIGID DISAPPROVAL OF MY SILENCE.OTHER IMAGES PASSED QUICKLY BEFORE MY EYES—A MEMENTO MORI ARRANGEMENT OFCANDLES, BURNING SKULLS, AND GOBLIN FACES; THE FIGURES OF WOMEN IN BLACK DRESSESSTRETCHING OUT LONG WHITE ARMS TOWARD ME FROM THE EDGES OF MY VISION—BUT WHEN ITRIED TO SPEAK OF THEM, THEY DISAPPEARED.THE KING BEGAN TO SHOUT AGAIN. “WHEN IS HE GOING TO SEE THE FABULOUS CASTLES?THE CITIES OF THE SPIRITS?” HE ASKED, EXASPERATED. HE STORMED OUT OF THE ROOM.“I THINK THEY’RE GOING TO KEEP FEEDING YOU IBOGA UNTIL YOU START TALKING,”LIEBERMAN WHISPERED.MEANWHILE, I WAS FIGHTING AGAINST PULSES THAT GATHERED INTO WAVES OF NAUSEA. IWANTED TO REACH THE DEEPEST VISIONARY STATE. I WAS ALSO SCARED. IF IBOGA WASINDEED A “SUPER-CONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL ENTITY,” I WASN’T SURE WHETHER THIS ENTITYLIKED OR HATED ME. PERHAPS IT WANTED TO KILL ME. I WAS AN OUTSIDER, A STRANGERTO ITS MEANINGS. THEY BROUGHT ME OUTSIDE, WHERE I STOOD UNDER THE COOL STARS. IREMEMBERED KING MOUTAMBA SAYING, EARLIER, “LE JOURNALISTE A MANGÉ BEAUCOUP,BEAUCOUP.” HAD I EATEN TOO MUCH?I WAS DRENCHED IN SWEAT. MY HEAD SEEMED LIKE A BALLOON, BLOWN UP SEVERAL TIMESITS NORMAL SIZE. I WONDERED IF I WAS GOING TO DIE. I RETCHED AND VOMITED GREENSLIME INTO MY PAIL.WHEN I WAS NO LONGER SICK, THE BWITI TOOK ME BACK INSIDE THE TEMPLE. THEYBROUGHT ME TO A MAT ON THE HARD-PACKED EARTH AND INSTRUCTED ME TO LIE DOWN. THEKING RETURNED TO HIS SEAT. THE BWITI TRIBESMEN STARTED DRUMMING AND SINGING. THEAWESOME SOUND FILLED THE TEMPLE, POUNDING AGAINST THE WALLS OF MY SKULL. I FELTAN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF FAILURE AS I SCORNED MY OWN FOOLISHNESS: WHO WAS I TO TRYTO ENTER THE AFRICAN SPIRIT WORLD?FROM TIME TO TIME THE DRUMS AND THE SINGING STOPPED, AND THE KING WOULD MAKE ASPEECH TO HIS TRIBE, SLIPPING BETWEEN BANTU AND FRENCH. I DIDN’T KNOW EITHERLANGUAGE, BUT I FELT I COULD UNDERSTAND EVERY NUANCE OF EVERY WORD HE SPOKE. HEWAS DERIDING ME, MAKING FUN OF MY ANATOMY, MY VISIONARY FAILURES, MYWEAKNESS—SEVERAL TIMES I HAD ASKED FOR A BLANKET TO COVER MYSELF, AND A PILLOWFOR MY HEAD, BUT THE BWITI REJECTED THESE REQUESTS.“THE FOREIGNERS, THEY SAY THEY WANT THE TRUE BWITI INITIATION,” THE KING SEEMEDTO SAY WITH A SNEER. “WELL, THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE GETTING. NOW THEY COMPLAIN: ‘IWANT A BLANKET, I WANT A PILLOW,’ THEY SAY. THE TRUE BWITI DOESN’T WANT ANYCOMFORT.”FINALLY THE KING TOOK A BREAK FROM MOCKING ME. THE IMPOSSIBLY BEAUTIFULMUSIC—POLYRHYTHMS, CALL-AND-RESPONSE SONGS—STARTED UP AGAIN.CLOSING MY EYES, I SAW BRIGHTLY COLORED PATTERNS. SPIRALING PLANTLIKE FORMS ANDDANCING GEOMETRIES SWIRLED WITH THE MUSIC. I FELL INTO A TRANCE, FLOATING WITHTHE BWITI SONGS. I DRIFTED INTO A NEW PHASE OF THE TRIP.PIECE BY PIECE, THE PATTERN OF MY PAST BEGAN TO FLARE UP IN MY MIND. FOR THENEXT SEVERAL HOURS, I FORGOT ABOUT THE TRIBESMEN WATCHING ME. I WAS WITNESSING A“MEMORY THEATER,” A SCRUPULOUS REPLAYING OF ALL THE FORCES THAT SCULPTED ME INTOTHE PERSON I WAS. I REVIEWED THE ELEMENTS OF MY EARLY LIFE—MY PARENTS’SEPARATION, MY FATHER’S ABSENCE FROM MY CHILDHOOD, THE IMPRINT OF MY MOTHER’SLONELINESS AND DEPRESSION, MY OWN SOLITUDE AND LOVE OF READING, THE MANY MONTHSI SPENT IN A HOSPITAL BED AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN WITH A BACTERIAL INFECTION IN MYSPINE. I WENT BACK TO THE SECRET, BAROQUE SOURCES OF CHILDHOOD NIGHTMARE ANDFANTASY—THE PRIMAL FEAR OF THE MONSTERS UNDER THE BED, THE CAVE OF DARKNESSINSIDE THE CLOSET. I SAW THE DESPERATE, DESOLATE PARTS OF MY LIFE AND THEFLASHES OF POWER AND INVENTION THAT WERE ALSO MINE. SEPARATE FROM MYSELF, YETENCLOSED WITHIN MYSELF, I FOLLOWED THE TRACES OF THE BEING THAT I WAS, THAT WASGIVEN TO ME, AS IT UNFOLDED OVER TIME.LAID OUT FOR ME WAS THE ENTIRE, INTRICATE PROCESS OF MY SELF-DEVELOPMENT. THEPROCESS WAS COMPLEX YET ULTIMATELY ORGANIC. THE EXTENSION OF THE SELF WAS, IREALIZED, A NATURAL PROCESS, AKIN TO THE BLOSSOMING OF A PLANT. WHILE A PLANTEXTENDS TOWARD THE SUN THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE, HUMAN BEINGS EVOLVE INTERNALLY. WERISE UP AND FLOURISH, OR BECOME STUNTED, INVOLUTED, AS WE REACT TO THE FORCESTHAT PRESS AGAINST US. OUR GROWTH TAKES PLACE IN THE INVISIBLE REALM OF OURMENTAL SPACE, AND THE UNREACHABLE SUN WE RISE TOWARD IS KNOWLEDGE—OF THE SELFAND THE UNIVERSE.HENRY JAMES ONCE DESCRIBED HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AS “A HELPLESS JELLY POURED INTOA MOLD.” IBOGA COMPELLED ME TO PERCEIVE THE EXACT SHAPE OF THAT MOLD; AT THESAME TIME, IT ALLOWED ME TO ESCAPE THAT SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS. I FELT A MINGLINGOF WONDER, SORROW, AND FREEDOM. BY LETTING ME PERCEIVE THE SHAPE OF MY PASTSELF, IBOGA ALSO SEEMED TO BE FREEING ME FROM THE BURDEN OF THAT PAST. THEACTION OF THE DRUG ACTUALLY WAS—AS I HAD HEARD IT DESCRIBED BUT WOULDN’TBELIEVE—THE EQUIVALENT OF TEN YEARS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS COMPACTED INTO ONEINTERMINABLE NIGHT.FOR A BRIEF TIME I MULLED ON MY DRINKING HABITS. I KNEW I WASN’T AN ALCOHOLIC,BUT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL I HAD RELIED ON BOOZE AS A TOOL FOR SOCIALIZING. FOR THEFIRST TIME I FULLY REALIZED THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT ALCOHOL HAD ON MYRELATIONSHIPS, MY WORK, ON ME IN GENERAL. ALCOHOL FIRED UP MY ID, SENT MESTAGGERING ACROSS ENDLESS PARTIES AND BARROOM FLOORS IN AN AGGRESSIVE, SOMETIMESSUCCESSFUL, PURSUIT OF SEX. BUT DRINKING WAS HOLDING ME BACK—IT WAS LIKE AWEIGHT I WAS DRAGGING AROUND. IT WAS KEEPING ME FROM MY OWN SELF-DEVELOPMENT. ISAW MYSELF AS A DRUNKEN IDIOT AT PARTIES, CYCLED THROUGH MANY NIGHTS WHERE IDRANK TO BLOT MYSELF OUT. THERE WAS A DARK TINGE OF SHAME AND SELF-DISGUSTENTWINED IN MY OVERUSE OF ALCOHOL. I REALIZED I DIDN’T NEED TO DO IT ANYMORE.THROUGH IBOGA, I RECOGNIZED MY EXISTING SELF AS THE PRODUCT OF ALL THE PHYSICALAND PSYCHOLOGICAL FORCES THAT HAD ACTED UPON ME. YET THERE SEEMED TO BESOMETHING BEYOND ALL OF IT, SOMETHING THAT WAS “MINE,” AN ENERGY PROJECTED FROMOUTSIDE OF MY BIOGRAPHICAL DESTINY. THAT ENERGY WAS THE SELF—AND THE SELF’STREMENDOUS CAPACITY FOR TRANSFORMATION.THE TRIP TURNED TO A CINEMATIC CYCLONE, WHIRLING IMAGES AND SCENES AT HIGHSPEED. A SERIES OF UNKNOWN HOUSES APPEARED, GHOSTLY GRAY SUBURBAN LANDSCAPES IHAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I DRIFTED DOWN INTO THEM AS THEY FADED AWAY.IMPRESSIONS OF OLD GIRLFRIENDS DISPERSED LIKE FOG, THEIR BODIES DANCING AWAYFROM ME INTO THE ETHER. I SAW THE SIGN FOR A RESTAURANT, TEACHER’S TOO, ACHILDHOOD HAUNT. IN ITS HEYDAY, TEACHER’S TOO (ACROSS THE STREET FROM THEORIGINAL TEACHER’S) WAS A MAROON-COLORED MEETING PLACE FOR PUBLISHING TYPES,PROFESSORS, THE LOST LIBERAL INTELLIGENTSIA OF THE UPPER WEST SIDE.TEACHER’S TOO WAS THE PLACE WHERE I MET MY FIRST SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND, AFTER IDROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE. I ARRIVED EARLY FOR A LUNCH DATE, AND STARTED TO CHATWITH THE RESTAURANT’S CUTE HOSTESS. SHE WAS SIPPING A BLOODY MARY AT THE BAR,WEARING A PLASTIC HAT FOR ST. PATRICK’S DAY. SHE WAS GIGGLY, VIVACIOUS—IT WAS ASIF AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT FLOWED AROUND HER. JULIE TOLD ME SHE WAS ALSO A COLLEGEDROPOUT. SUDDENLY I REMEMBERED HER: WE HAD MET ONCE AT A PARTY DURING HIGHSCHOOL WHEN SHE WAS DATING A FRIEND OF MINE. AFTER THAT CHANCE MEETING, WESTARTED SEEING EACH OTHER, AND STAYED TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS.THE LETTERS OF THE RESTAURANT SIGN PEELED OFF ONE BY ONE IN SMALL SQUARES, ASTHOUGH THEY WERE PIECES FROM A BOARD GAME. THE SQUARES SPUN AROUND IN MY MENTALSPACE WITH A CLICKING SOUND. IT WAS LIKE A CHEAP SPECIAL EFFECT FROM AN OLDMOVIE. THE LETTERS REASSEMBLED, REBUSLIKE, TO SPELL OUT A PHRASE THAT WAS EITHER“TOUCHERS TEACH TOO” OR “TOUCHERS TEACH TWO.”THIS AMBIGUOUS MESSAGE, THIS TELEGRAPHIC KOAN, SEEMED TO CONTAIN A CODE ABOUT MYFUTURE RELATIONSHIPS. THERE WAS A SENSE OF RECONCILIATION AND HOPE IN THEPHRASE, BUT WHAT DID IT MEAN? IT SEEMED TO SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVINGCHILDREN—TWO TO BE EXACT—AN OPTION I HAD RARELY CONSIDERED, CERTAINLY NOT AT THETIME OF MY TRIP TO GABON, WHEN I HAD NO MONEY, NO GIRLFRIEND, AND NO PROSPECTSFOR EITHER.THE DRUMMING AND SINGING BECAME DEAFENING IN THE LOW-CEILINGED TEMPLE. IN MYALTERED STATE THE SONGS WERE AWESOME IN THEIR BEAUTY. THERE WAS A STRAIN OFSELF-AWARE HUMOR IN THE MELODIES. INTRICATE RHYTHMS UNFOLDED ORGANICALLY AS IFTHE MUSIC, CHANNELED BY THE BWITI, WAS EMANATING FROM THE PLANT’S ESSENCE. IREALIZED THE DEPTH OF THE TRIBE’S BOND WITH THIS PLANT THAT SHOWED THEM THINGS.I FELT HOW COMPLETE THEIR CULTURE WAS IN ITSELF. SO COMPLETE THAT NO OUTSIDERCOULD DISTURB IT. THE MUSIC EXPRESSED THE BOTANICAL SYMBIOSIS, ESSENCE OF THEBWITI’S PRIDE AND POWER.LATE THAT NIGHT THE BWITI MADE US RISE AND DANCE WITH THEM. THE MEN TRIED TOTEACH ME THE BASIC STEPS—HARD FOR ME TO FOLLOW IN MY STATE OF STONEDSELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND MY SENSITIVITY TO THE KING’S DISAPPROVAL. THEN WE SATDOWN TO WATCH AS EACH MAN IN THE TRIBE DANCED AROUND THE TEMPLE, WHIRLING ATORCH, SCATTERING SHADOWS ACROSS THE WALLS LIKE LIVING FORMS. THEY EXECUTEDTHEIR STEPS WITH EXPERT GRACE AND GRAVITY.“AFTER YOU TAKE IBOGA YOU WILL KNOW WHAT BWITI IS,” THE KING HAD TOLD ME THE DAYBEFORE THE RITUAL. I WAS STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. PERHAPS IBOGA OPENED ASYMBIOTIC LINK BETWEEN PLANT AND HUMAN, A DOORWAY FOR INTERSPECIESCOMMUNICATION. BUT IF THAT WERE SO, WHO OR WHAT WAS COMMUNICATING FROM THE OTHERSIDE? I WAS LEFT WITH AN IMPRESSION OF CONTACT WITH SOME OTHER INTELLIGENCE ORENTITY EXISTING IN A REALM OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN. I WONDERED IF WHAT MY GUIDE SAIDWAS TRUE, THAT IN BWITI, LIKE BUDDHISM, THERE IS NO ULTIMATE DEITY, JUST ANENDLESS PLAY OF FORMS, VAST HIEROPHANIES OF SPIRITS, SPINNING LIKE PINWHEELSACROSS THE ETERNAL VOID.I KNEW, INTELLECTUALLY, THAT TRIBAL GROUPS ATTRIBUTE SPIRIT AND SENTIENCE TOPLANTS. CLAUDE LÉVI-STRAUSS WROTE ABOUT THIS IN THE SAVAGE MIND, GIVING SOMEEXAMPLES OF A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON: “WHEN A MEDICINE MAN OF EASTERN CANADAGATHERS ROOTS OR LEAVES, HE IS CAREFUL TO PROPITIATE THE SOUL OF EACH PLANT BYPLACING A TINY OFFERING AT ITS BASE.” MY IBOGA EXPERIENCE TESTED THE LIMITS OFMY OWN BELIEFS: HOW COULD EATING A BITTER BARK TAKE ME ON SUCH A PROFOUND ANDCAREFULLY STRUCTURED JOURNEY THROUGH MY PAST, INTO MY FUTURE? COULD A PLANT HAVEA “SOUL” OR AN INTELLIGENCE? I HAD NEVER TAKEN THIS IDEA SERIOUSLY BEFORE.AT DAWN, THE BWITI LED US OUTSIDE TO WATCH THE SUNRISE. PINK LIGHT FILTERED OVERTHE PALM FRONDS AND FRUIT TREES, ACROSS THE DUSTY DISORDER OF THE VILLAGE. THEYSANG, AND WE SANG WITH THEM.THE ANALYST AND I STAGGERED WOOZILY AS THE RITUAL ENDED, BUT THE KINGIMMEDIATELY STARTED SHOUTING AT US AGAIN. “NOW YOU HAVE BEEN INITIATED, YOU GIVEME PRESENTS OF MONEY!” HE SCREAMED. “I DEMAND MORE MONEY FOR THE VISIONS I HAVESHOWN YOU!” WE DECIDED TO ESCAPE HIS SHOUTS AND CHECK INTO A HOTEL IN LAMBARÉNÉ.THIS REQUIRED ANOTHER LONG AND TENSE NEGOTIATION.“J’AI EU DES VISIONS DE RUINE TERRIBLE,” THE KING SHOUTED.BECAUSE LE JOURNALISTE HAD NOT SEEN OR TOLD ALL OF HIS VISIONS, HE EXPLAINED, WEWOULD BE IN MORTAL DANGER IF WE DID NOT STAY ANOTHER NIGHT. AS THE BOTANISTINSISTED WE WERE LEAVING ANYWAY, THE KING TRIED TO MAKE A FAST BARGAIN.INTRODUCING THE ANALYST TO THE FATHER OF A NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL, HE SUGGESTEDTHAT, INSTEAD OF PAYING MORE, SHE TAKE THE MAN’S DAUGHTER AND RAISE HER INAMERICA. THIS WAS CRUDE BUT PRAGMATIC PSYCHOLOGY ON THE PART OF THE KING: WHILETRIPPING, THE ANALYST TOLD THE BWITI SHE REGRETTED NOT HAVING A CHILD, BUT SHEDIDN’T EXPECT AN INSTANT CHANCE TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION.WE CONVINCED ONE OF THE KING’S SONS TO DRIVE US TO THE OGOBUE PALACE, A PLACIDHOTEL OVERLOOKING THE RIVER. IN MY HOTEL ROOM, I FOUND THE IBOGA TRIP WAS STILLGOING ON. I WAS WIDE AWAKE AND WITHOUT HUNGER, ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT SLEPT OR EATENIN OVER THIRTY HOURS. LYING IN BED, AN EERIE STRAIN OF BWITI MUSIC RETURNED TOMY EARS. I WATCHED A PARADE OF FLEETING PHANTASMS THAT DRIFTED ACROSS CRACKS INTHE WHITE WALL. SOLEMN MEN IN FUNNY HATS AND ANTIQUE COATS MARCHED AWAY, MELTINGINTO THE PLASTER, TRAILED BY FADING RHYTHMS. I REALIZED THESE WERE THE “ANCESTORSHADES,” GHOST-IMPRESSIONS OF MY FOREFATHERS, A VISION THAT THE IBOGA TRANCEOFTEN PRODUCED, ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTS I HAD READ.I DESCEND FROM EUROPEANS—POLISH JEWS AND IRISH CATHOLICS—AND KNOW LITTLE ABOUTMY ANCESTORS, MY HISTORY. AS THE FIGURES PARADED ACROSS THE WALL, I WISHED ICOULD LINGER AMONG THEM, SEE THEM MORE CLEARLY.SO FAINT—SO QUICK—THEY MELTED AWAY."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5I AM THE ONE YOU SEEK[images/00006.jpg] I DID NOT UNDERGO THE MOST EXTREME FORM OF BWITI INITIATION.THE AWARD FOR MOST EXTREME INITIATION GOES, HANDS DOWN, TO THE BAD-ASS BWITI OFTHE MITSOGHO, WHO LIVE IN THE SOUTHERN REACHES OF GABON. BEFORE THE CEREMONY,THE HARDCORE MITSOGHO SHAVE OFF THE INITIATE’S HAIR. THEY PIERCE HIS TONGUE WITHA LONG NEEDLE. THEN, AFTER HE HAS EATEN IBOGA, HIS SKULL IS HIT WITH A HAMMERTHREE TIMES IN ORDER “TO BREAK OPEN THE HEAD,” HELPING HIM ENTER THE SPIRITWORLD. IN REPORTS OF VISIONS FROM THE MITSOGHO RITUAL, THE BAANZI, THE INITIATE,MEETS THE ORIGINAL BWITI MAN AND WOMAN, THEN VISITS THE “VILLAGE OF THE DEAD”: SUDDENLY, THE “VILLAGE OF THE DEAD” IS COVERED WITH INCREASINGLY INTENSE SPARKS,A “BALL OF LIGHT” TAKES SHAPE AND BECOMES DISTINCT (KOMBE, THE SUN). THIS BALLOF LIGHT QUESTIONS THE VISITOR AS TO THE REASONS FOR HIS JOURNEY. “DO YOU KNOWWHO I AM? I AM THE CHIEF OF THE WORLD, I AM THE ESSENTIAL POINT!” THE BRUTAL MITSOGHO INITIATION LASTS FOR DAYS, DURING WHICH THEY INDUCE THEBAANZI TO EAT SUCH A HUGE AMOUNT OF IBOGA THAT HE LAPSES INTO COMPLETEUNCONSCIOUSNESS. FOR YEARS AFTER THE RITUAL, FRAGMENTS OF HIS VISIONS WILL COMEBACK TO HIM IN DREAMS AND INTIMATIONS.BY COMPARISON, THE BWITI OF THE FANG IS A GENTLE BRANCH OF THE CULT, OFFERING ASYNCRETIC MIXTURE OF CHRISTIAN AND NATIVE BELIEFS. A STANDARD VISION FROM THEFANG CEREMONY SUBSTITUTES CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS FOR NATIVE MYTHOLOGY, BUT ISOTHERWISE SIMILAR: DURING HIS JOURNEY, HE SEES MANY SAINTS, NOAH, PRIESTS IN THEIR CASSOCK. CHRIST,DRESSED IN GOLD GARMENTS, QUESTIONS THE STRANGER AS TO THE REASON FOR HIS VISIT.AND THE NEOPHYTE ANSWERS: “I AM SEEKING, I WANT TO SEE THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.”“I AM THE ONE YOU SEEK,” CHRIST REPLIES. THESE DESCRIPTIONS COME FROM ROBERT GOUTAREL, A FRENCH CHEMIST WHO STUDIED IBOGAIN DEPTH. GOUTAREL DEFINED THE MEANING OF THE BOTANICAL REVELATION FOR BWITIINITIATES: “IBOGA BRINGS ABOUT THE VISUAL, TACTILE, AND AUDITORY CERTAINTY OFTHE IRREFUTABLE EXISTENCE OF THE BEYOND.” THE PLANT-SPIRIT DIRECTLY REVEALS THATTHE HUMAN SOUL IS A “SPIRITUALLY IMMUTABLE SUBSTANCE.” THROUGH INITIATION, THEBAANZI DISCOVERS THAT MAN EXISTS ON TWO PLANES OF EXISTENCE AT ONCE—THE MATERIALPLANE AND THE SPIRITUAL ONE. “PHYSICAL DEATH LOSES ALL MEANING BECAUSE IT ISNOTHING BUT A NEW LIFE, ANOTHER EXISTENCE,” GOUTAREL WRITES. “IT IS IBOGA THATCONDITIONS THE SEVERAL EXISTENCES.”GOUTAREL ALSO THOUGHT THE IBOGA VISIONS DIFFERED IN CHARACTER FROM THOSE INDUCEDBY LSD. LSD HALLUCINATIONS “BELONG TO A HIGH AND ANGELIC DOMAIN OF ESTHETICSENSATIONS.” THE IBOGAINE DOMAIN, ON THE OTHER HAND, “IS THAT OF THESUBTERRANEAN WORLD OF FREUD, OF ANIMAL IMPULSE AND OF REGRESSION.” SIMILARLY,CLAUDIO NARANJO, A CHILEAN PSYCHIATRIST WHO USED IBOGAINE IN THERAPY, COMPAREDTHE IBOGA VISIONS TO THOSE PRODUCED BY HARMALINE AND HARMINE, THE PSYCHOACTIVECOMPOUNDS IN AYAHUASCA. HE FOUND, WITH IBOGAINE, “THE QUALITY OF THE FANTASY ISGENERALLY MORE PERSONAL AND CONCERNS THE SUBJECT HIMSELF, HIS PARENTS ANDSIGNIFICANT OTHERS.”. . .IBOGA—LIKE HEROIN, MARIJUANA, ECSTASY, AND LSD—IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG IN THEUNITED STATES, OUTLAWED IN MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES. “SCHEDULE ONE’’ MEANS THAT ITIS CONSIDERED TO HAVE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE BUT NO MEDICAL VALUE. IBOGA WAS GIVENTHIS STATUS IN THE LATE 1960S, WHEN ANXIETY ABOUT RECREATIONAL USE OFPSYCHEDELICS REACHED A FEVER PITCH AND GOVERNMENTS REACTED WITH HYSTERIA. “THE1967–68 RESOLUTIONS OF THE WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY CLASSIFIED IBOGAINE AMONG THEDRUGS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING DEPENDENCY OR IMPAIRING HUMAN HEALTH,” GOUTARELWROTE. “THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT EVEN THOUGH IBOGAINE IS CONSIDERED AS AHALLUCINOGEN (ONEIROPHRENIC), IT PRODUCES NO DRUG DEPENDENCY AND IT HAS PROVEDTO SUPPRESS DEPENDENCY TO OPIATES, AMPHETAMINES, COCAINE, LSD, AND EVEN ALCOHOLAND TOBACCO.” IBOGAINE MADE A BRIEF APPEARANCE IN THE SIXTIES UNDERGROUND DRUGTRADE, THEN VANISHED. HE WRITES, “IBOGAINE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED FROM THE MARKETAND IT SEEMS THAT THE DRUG DEALERS RAPIDLY BECAME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT ITS USEWOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF PART OF THEIR CLIENTELE.”DR. DEBORAH MASH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI IS THE ONLY GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONEDRESEARCHER CURRENTLY STUDYING IBOGAINE AS A TREATMENT FOR ADDICTION. MASH HASSET UP A CLINIC FOR THIS PURPOSE ON THE ISLAND OF ST. KITT’S. IN A SEPTEMBER2000 PAPER FOR THE ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, MASH AND HERCOLLABORATORS COMPILED THE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE IBOGAINE DOSE, FOLLOWED BYPOSTTREATMENT THERAPY, ON TWENTY-SEVEN ADDICTS. THEY CONCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: AFTER TREATMENT WITH IBOGAINE, OPIATE-DEPENDENT SUBJECTS WERE LESS LIKELY TOANTICIPATE POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM HEROIN (OR OTHER OPIATE) USE, LESS LIKELY TOBELIEVE THAT HEROIN (OR OPIATE) USE WOULD RELIEVE WITHDRAWAL/DYSPHORIA, AND MORELIKELY TO BELIEVE IN THEIR CONTROL FOR ABSTAINING OR STOPPING THEIR DRUG USE.IBOGAINE TREATMENT ALSO DECREASED PARTICIPANTS’ DESIRE AND INTENTION TO USEHEROIN. SCIENTISTS CURRENTLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HOW IBOGA AFFECTS THE BRAIN, BUT NOTMUCH. THE IBOGAINE MOLECULE IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX ALKALOID (THE INTIMIDATINGCHEMICAL NAME IS 3-METHYL-5-ETHYLPYRIDINE). LIKE MOST OF THE KNOWN PSYCHEDELICDRUGS, IT HAS A STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THE NEUROTRANSMITTER SEROTONIN, WHICH ISBELIEVED TO PERFORM MANY FUNCTIONS AND HELPS TO REGULATE SENSORYINFORMATION—WHETHER SENSE DATA TRICKLES, FLOWS, POURS, OR FLOODS INTO THE BRAIN.PSILOCYBIN, MESCALINE, AND LSD ARE ALSO ALKALOIDS THAT RESEMBLE SEROTONIN. THESUPERPOTENT HALLUCINOGEN DMT (NN-DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE) IS A VERY CLOSE COUSIN TOSEROTONIN—A SIMILAR MOLECULAR STRUCTURE WITH THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO METHYLGROUPS. SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIS), SUCH AS THEANTIDEPRESSANTS PROZAC AND ZOLOFT, LIMIT MOOD SWINGS BY MODULATING THE RELEASEOF SEROTONIN.BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO SEROTONIN, PSYCHEDELICS BOND TEMPORARILYTO MANY OF THE SAME RECEPTOR SITES AS SEROTONIN AND SIMILARNEUROTRANSMITTERS—AND THAT IS THE PRINCIPLE CAUSE OF THEIR ACTIVITY. I NOW THINKOF THE BRAIN (AS DISTINCT FROM THE MIND) AS A KIND OF RADIO. WITH “NORMATIVE”LEVELS OF SEROTONIN, THE BRAIN IS TUNED TO THE “CONSENSUAL REALITY”—SOMETHINGLIKE THE LOCAL POP OR TALK RADIO STATION. BY SUBSTITUTING PSILOCYBIN, IBOGAINE,DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE, OR SOME OTHER PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUND FOR SEROTONIN AND OTHERNEUROTRANSMITTERS, YOU CHANGE THE STATION AND SUDDENLY YOU BEGIN TO PICK UP THESENSORIAL EQUIVALENT OF AVANT-GARDE JAZZ, TIBETAN CHANTS, OR ANOTHER CHANNELRESONATING WITH NEW AND ASTONISHING INFORMATION. YET YOUR MIND, THE PERCEIVINGCORE OF THE SELF, REMAINS MORE OR LESS UNAFFECTED. IN THAT SENSE, PSYCHEDELICS,UNLIKE ALCOHOL OR HEROIN, ARE NOT EVEN INTOXICATING.GOUTAREL WROTE, “IBOGAINE INHIBITS THE OXIDATION OF SEROTONIN AND CATALYZES THATOF CATECHOLAMINES BY A MAO (MONOAMINE OXIDASE), CERUPLASMIN.” MONOAMINE OXIDASEIS AN ENZYME IN THE STOMACH THAT RENDERS MANY POTENTIALLY MIND-INFLUENCINGCOMPOUNDS INACTIVE BEFORE THEY REACH THE BRAIN. IBOGAINE, LIKE THE AMAZONIANPSYCHEDELIC AYAHUASCA, CONTAINS A NATURAL MAO INHIBITOR. THE AYAHUASCA POTION,HOWEVER, IS A MIXTURE OF TWO PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT PROPERTIES. ALL BY ITSELF,THE IBOGA PLANT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CHEMICAL FACTORY.CURRENTLY, NO SCIENTIFIC THEORY EXPLAINS WHY PLANTS LIKE IBOGA GO TO THE TROUBLEOF CREATING PSYCHOACTIVE ALKALOIDS. THE COMPOUNDS SEEM TO CONVEY NO EVOLUTIONARYBENEFIT TO THE BOTANICALS, AND THEY REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND TIME TOPRODUCE.“WHY DO PLANTS MAKE ALKALOIDS?” THE PSYCHEDELIC CHEMIST SASHA SHULGIN ASKED AT ALECTURE I ATTENDED IN MEXICO. “IT’S BASICALLY UNKNOWN. MAYBE TO KEEP ANTS AWAY?SOME PEOPLE SAY ALKALOIDS ARE GARBAGE DUMPS FOR NITROGEN, BUT WHY PRODUCE ACOMPOUND THAT TAKES TWO YEARS TO SYNTHESIZE?” NO SCIENCE CAN EXPLAIN THEDRAWN-OUT PHASES OF A LARGE-DOSE IBOGAINE TRIP, THE TWENTY-HOUR PASSAGE FROMVISION TO INSIGHT, EXPERIENCED ALMOST UNIVERSALLY.THE IBOGAINE MOLECULE IS ESPECIALLY COMPLEX—MORE THAN MOST PSYCHEDELICS. IT ISSO INTRICATE THAT IT CANNOT BE SYNTHESIZED IN A LABORATORY. BESIDES BEING “APOTENT SEROTEGENIC” COMPOUND, MEANING IT WORKS AT SEROTONIN-RECEPTOR SITES,IBOGAINE ALSO SEEMS TO INTERACT WITH DOPAMINE, ANOTHER NEUROTRANSMITTER, WHICHREGULATES THE BODY’S EXPERIENCE OF PLEASURE AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRAVINGSOF ADDICTION.IN 1994, THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE PUBLISHED A FEATURE ON IBOGAINE THAT WASFULL OF INTERESTING INFORMATION BUT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE DISASTER FOR IBOGAINE’SFUTURE AS A MAINSTREAM TREATMENT FOR DRUG ADDICTION. THE ARTICLE FOLLOWED ANEXPERIMENTAL IBOGAINE TREATMENT PROGRAM IN HOLLAND. DURING THE WRITER’S VISIT TOHOLLAND, THE PROGRAM WAS DISCONTINUED DUE TO THE DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN ADDICT.THE ADDICT PROBABLY CONTINUED TO TAKE HEROIN RIGHT BEFORE SHE STARTED HERIBOGAINE TREATMENT. IT IS NOT A CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD MECHANISM, BUT IBOGAINE SEEMSTO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE POTENCY OF ALL DRUGS IN THE BLOODSTREAM. FORADDICTS SEEKING TO USE IBOGAINE, A ONE-DAY PERIOD OF DETOX IS NECESSARY FIRST,TO AVOID A TOXIC REACTION.BUT HOW COULD IBOGAINE HELP BREAK ADDICTION? THE TIMES NOTED: “HEROIN ANDCOCAINE ORDINARILY TRIGGER DOPAMINE’S RELEASE IN THE BRAIN’S ‘REWARD CENTER,’PRODUCING FEELINGS OF EUPHORIA. IBOGAINE APPEARS TO DISRUPT THIS MECHANISM,BLOCKING SOME RELEASES WHILE STIMULATING OTHERS.” THIS MIGHT TEMPORARILY IMPEDETHE EFFECTS OF DRUGS, BUT, THE ARTICLE WENT ON TO ASK, “HOW CAN IBOGAINE AFFECTBEHAVIOR LONG AFTER IT DISAPPEARS FROM THE BLOODSTREAM?”ONE THEORY IS THAT IBOGAINE RESTORES A BALANCE BETWEEN THE BRAIN’S TWOHEMISPHERES. DR. CARL ANDERSON OF MCLEAN HOSPITAL, VIRGINIA, BELIEVES THATPEOPLE PRONE TO ADDICTION SUFFER FROM AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE LEFT AND RIGHTHEMISPHERES. THE CONVENTIONAL MODEL IS THAT OUR “RATIONAL” PROCESSES—LANGUAGE,LOGIC, SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT—SPRING FROM THE LEFT HEMISPHERE, WHILE THE RIGHTHEMISPHERE CONTROLS THE “IRRATIONAL” PROCESSES—EMOTIONS, INTUITIONS, DREAMS,ETCETERA.ANDERSON SUGGESTS, “INTERHEMISPHERIC STRUGGLES, PRIMARILY A RESULT OF CHILDABUSE, MAY BE THE FUNDAMENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ROOT OF DRUG ADDICTION.” THIS ISPROBABLY AN EXAGGERATION. IN ANY CASE, DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE LEFT AND RIGHTBRAIN DISRUPT REM SLEEP, WHICH, AS ANDERSON NOTES, IS “ESSENTIAL FOR EMOTIONALREGULATION, LEARNING, AND MEMORY CONSOLIDATION.” IBOGA, OR IBOGAINE, ACCESSESREM CYCLING IN A POWERFUL WAY, AND BECAUSE OF THIS, MOST PEOPLE NEED LESS SLEEPFOR WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS AFTER ONE STRONG, AND LONG, DOSE.DRUG ABUSE IS, FOR ANDERSON, “STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH ASYMETRIC HEMISPHERICFUNCTION.” IF IBOGAINE CAUSES “BIHEMISPHERIC REINTEGRATION,” IT MIGHT RETURN TOPSYCHICALLY DAMAGED PEOPLE THE HEALING POWER OF THEIR SLEEP AND DREAMS. THEIBOGAINE TRIP WOULD BE “A HEALING JOURNEY THROUGH THE FRACTAL HYPERSPACE OFEMOTIONALLY INDEXED CHILDHOOD MEMORIES.” THIS IS AN ELEGANT, BUT HIGHLYSPECULATIVE, THEORY ABOUT AN AREA THAT REMAINS LARGELY UNRESEARCHED."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6I SEE YOURGRANDMOTHER[images/00006.jpg] WE DID NOT SEE THE KING AGAIN. AFTER A NIGHT’S REST,LIEBERMAN AND I WENT ON A SEARCH THROUGH LAMBARÉNÉ FOR OTHER BWITI SHAMANS. THEBOTANIST WANTED TO BUY IBOGA SEEDS AND POWDER TO TAKE BACK WITH HIM TO SOUTHAFRICA. I HOPED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BWITI. OFF THE MAIN STREETS, YOU COULDWALK FOR HOURS ON JUNGLE FOOTPATHS BETWEEN SMALL SETTLEMENTS. THE TOWN’S BACKALLEYS FORMED MAZES OF LITTLE HOUSES AND SHACKS IN THE WOODS, AND EACH SEPARATEMAZE WAS ITS OWN COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE WORKED AND HUNG OUT. EACH NEIGHBORHOODSEEMED TO HAVE ITS OWN BWITI TEMPLE. BUILT OUT OF WOODEN BOARDS AND PALM FRONDS,THEY WERE MODEST, UNPRETENTIOUS STRUCTURES COMPARED TO THE KING’S CONCRETESANCTUARY.IN ONE OF THESE LOCAL SHRINES WE FOUND PAPA SIMONE, A YOUNG, BEARDED SHAMAN WITHA WISE FACE AND A PENSIVE, GENTLE MANNER. I DESCRIBED MY VISIONS, SCANT THOUGHTHEY SEEMED, TO PAPA SIMONE, AND HE INTERPRETED THEM THOUGHTFULLY. THE WOODENSTATUE, HE SAID, WAS THE SPIRIT OF LE BOIS SACRÉ ITSELF, “WHICH COMES OUT ANDENGAGES YOU IN CONVERSATION.” THE PICTURES OF MY APARTMENT AND THE CITY STREETSWERE A TELEPATHIC CHECK-IN, SHOWING ME THAT EVERYTHING WAS CALM—“TRANQUILLE”—ATHOME. THE BECKONING FEMALE FIGURES, HE SAID, INDICATED WHAT PATHS TO TAKE. I WASSORRY I HADN’T KNOWN BETTER HOW TO FOLLOW THEM.OUTSIDE SIMONE’S TEMPLE WE MET A THIN YOUNG GIRL IN THE BAANZI’S RED OUTFIT,SITTING ON A TREE STUMP. SHE HAD JUST GONE THROUGH HER BWITI INITIATION, PAPASIMONE TOLD US. IBOGA HAD REVEALED SOME DANGERS FACING HER, SO SHE WAS STAYINGAT THE TEMPLE FOR A FEW DAYS OF HEALING RITUALS. SHE SHARED WITH PAPA SIMONE AQUALITY OF CALM INTELLIGENCE. I ASKED HER WHY SHE WENT THROUGH THE IBOGAINITIATION.“I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON,” SHE SAID. I LOVED HER DIGNITY AND THESIMPLICITY OF HER ANSWER. WHAT SHE WANTED WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, DISTILLEDTO ITS ESSENCE.LIEBERMAN ASKED PAPA SIMONE TO ORGANIZE ANOTHER ALL-NIGHT CEREMONY FOR US WITHHIS BWITI VILLAGE, A CLOSING RITUAL TO GIVE US THE OIL THAT THE KING HADWITHHELD. DURING THAT NIGHT OF DANCING, DRUMMING, AND SINGING, I SAW WHATLIEBERMAN HAD DESCRIBED AS “THE ESSENCE OF LOVE” IN THE COMMUNITY AROUND PAPASIMONE. THERE WERE SECRET PARTS TO THIS RITUAL, INVOLVING THE SACRIFICE OF AROOSTER IN A FIRE, AND SACRED CEREMONIES OF BONDING, DONE AMONG THE COMPANY OFMEN. ONE AFTER ANOTHER, THE BWITI MEN LET OUT LONG, WHOOPING CRIES IN THEIRLANGUAGE, AND HELPED ME TO IMITATE THEM. AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, EACH OF THEBWITI EMBRACED THE ANALYST, THEN ME, AND DANCED US AROUND THE TEMPLE FIRE LIKEWE WERE HUGE RAG DOLLS, SWINGING US AS VIOLENTLY AND QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THEEMBRACES TOLD US, MORE DIRECTLY THAN WORDS COULD, THAT DESPITE OUR ALIENLANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND PALE SKIN, WE WERE ACCEPTED AMONG THEM.FOR THE CEREMONY THEY WANTED US TO EAT IBOGA AGAIN. THEY SEEMED CURIOUS TO FINDOUT WHAT LES BLANCS COULD SEE. AFTER THE PREVIOUS NIGHT’S INDULGENCE, I TRIED,SHUDDERING, BUT I COULDN’T SWALLOW MORE THAN A SPOONFUL OF THE BARK (IT WASGREEN AND FRESH RATHER THAN DRIED AND WHITE, BUT TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE). THIS WASNOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE VISIONS. PAPA SIMONE’S TRIBE INCLUDED A LARGE, LAUGHING MANWEARING A RED LOINCLOTH, HIS SLEEK BLACK BODY DAUBED WITH WHITE PAINT. AS ONE OFTHE TRIBAL ELDERS, HE ATE IBOGA THROUGHOUT THE CEREMONY. HE KEPT POINTING AT THEBOWL OF SHAVINGS, AND THEN AT HIS OWN EYES, THEN AT ME, TRYING TO CONVINCE ME TOEAT MORE SO I WOULD SEE THINGS.TOWARD MORNING, THIS MAN, THE WHITES OF HIS EYES GLEAMING IN THE FIRELIGHT,ANNOUNCED HE WAS HAVING A VISION. HE SAID HE SAW A SPIRIT HOVERING OVER ME WHEREI SAT BY THE YELLOW FLAMES OF THE BONFIRE. WITH MATTER-OF-FACT CERTAINTY, HESPECIFIED THAT THIS SPIRIT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER ON MY MOTHER’S SIDE.“YOU WERE VERY CLOSE TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER, YOUR MOTHER’S MOTHER,” HE TOLD ME.“SHE LOVED YOU VERY MUCH, BUT NOW SHE IS DEAD, AND SHE DOESN’T WANT TO LET YOUGO. HER SPIRIT IS HANGING OVER YOU. SHE IS STOPPING YOU FROM SEEING VISIONS,FROM VISITING THE OTHER WORLD.”. . .THE TRIBESMAN’S VISION SHOCKED ME. THIS SHOCK CONTINUED TO REVERBERATE THROUGHMY LIFE. I WAS SURPRISED THAT HE SPECIFIED MY MOTHER’S MOTHER. SHE WAS THE ONLYGRANDPARENT I KNEW—THE OTHERS DIED BEFORE I WAS BORN. SHE HAD LIVED TO BEEIGHTY-EIGHT, DYING ONLY A YEAR BEFORE MY TRIP TO GABON. I HAD TOLD THE BWITINOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE. IF THIS MAN WAS GUESSING, IF HE WAS EXAGGERATING OR LYINGABOUT WHAT HE WAS SEEING, HE HAD ONLY A ONE-IN-FOUR CHANCE OF GETTING IT RIGHT.I DID HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY GRANDMOTHER, IN A WAY. SHE TOOK CARE OFME AS A CHILD WHEN MY MOTHER WENT OUT OF TOWN. AS I GOT OLDER, HOWEVER, I FOUNDHER A GLOOMY, LIFE-DENYING PRESENCE. SHE SEEMED UTTERLY FIXED, TRAPPED INSIDEHERSELF. AFTER HER TWO GLOOMY SISTERS DIED, NOBODY OR NOTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGHFOR HER, THEREFORE SHE HAD NO FRIENDS, NO LIFE. UNTIL HER DEATH, HER BESTFURNITURE REMAINED SLIPCOVERED IN PLASTIC, WAITING FOR AN IMPORTANT AND UNKNOWNVISITOR WHO NEVER ARRIVED. THERE WAS SOMETHING INSANE YET UNNERVINGLY POWERFULIN THE WAY SHE DENIED HERSELF ALL PLEASURE, ALL POSSIBILITY. DENIAL ANDENDURANCE—THOSE WERE THE ONLY VALUES THAT MATTERED TO HER AS SHE SLOWLY SANKINTO SENESCENCE.MY GRANDMOTHER’S LIFE WAS A SAD STORY OF IMMIGRANT AMERICA. HER PARENTS CAMEFROM POLAND; HER FATHER COULD NOT FIND A DECENT JOB IN NEW YORK, AND IN 1908 HEKILLED HIMSELF, ABANDONING HIS FAMILY. MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER, MY GRANDMOTHER, ANDMY TWO AUNTS COULD NOT FORGIVE HIM. THEY BURNED HIS PAPERS, DESTROYED ALL TRACESOF HIM. THEY NEVER SPOKE OF HIM AGAIN. THE TRAUMA OF HIS SUICIDE AND THEVENGEFUL ACT OF ANNIHILATION THAT FOLLOWED SHAPED MY GRANDMOTHER’S PSYCHE INTO AFORCEFUL MECHANISM OF REPRESSION.OF COURSE, AS A RATIONAL PRODUCT OF THE MODERN WORLD, I DIDN’T THINK ELEMENTS OFTHE PSYCHIC LIFE COULD CONTINUE AFTER DEATH. INTUITIVELY, HOWEVER, WITHIN THERIGHT-BRAIN WORLD OF MY INTUITIONS AND DREAMS, THE TRIBESMAN’S INSIGHTRESONATED.IF THERE WAS A “SPIRIT WORLD,” IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO THINK OF MY GRANDMOTHER ASA POSSESSIVE, NEGATING PHANTOM ANXIOUSLY HANGING OVER ME, KEEPING ME AWAY FROMREVELATIONS.MONTHS AFTER THE BWITI CEREMONY, I HAD AN EXTREMELY VIVID NIGHTMARE ABOUT MYGRANDMOTHER, WAKING UP AFTER DAWN TO WRITE IT IN MY NOTEBOOK. IN THE DREAM, MYGRANDMOTHER CALLED ME. SHE WAS IN MY HOUSE, CLEANING AND LOOKING THROUGH ALL OFMY CLOSETS, DRAWERS, AND MY DESK FOR WHAT SHE CALLED “THE BUSINESS” OR “THEPAPERS.” I COULD SEE HER IN MY APARTMENT, AN ANCIENT FIGURE, BEFUDDLED ANDUNHINGED, RIFLING THROUGH MY POSSESSIONS. I WAS FURIOUS AT HER, SCREAMING OVERTHE PHONE WITH ALMOST INHUMAN FERVOR, ORDERING HER TO LEAVE MY STUFF ALONE, TOGO AWAY AND REST, WATCH TELEVISION, NOT TO LOOK FOR THE PAPERS ANYMORE. SHEBACKED OFF. HER VOICE WAS SO REAL, QUAVERING.IN THE DAYS AFTERWARD, I FELT CLEANSED—IT WAS AS IF MY SPIRIT, GAINING STRENGTH,HAD EVICTED HER FROM THE PREMISES. I FELT AS IF SOME DARK VEIL HAD BEEN LIFTEDFROM ME. OF COURSE, MOST WESTERNERS WOULD INTERPRET THIS DREAM AS METAPHOR ORSUBCONSCIOUS SYMBOL. TO ME, THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THE MORE THE DREAMSEEMED, INTUITIVELY, REAL—A VICTORY OVER A RESIDUE OF HER PSYCHE BY MYUNCONSCIOUS SELF.CARL JUNG’S MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS IS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEDITATION ONTHE INNER WORLD REVEALED TO THE ANALYST THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE BY DREAMS,TELEPATHIC INCIDENTS, AND TRANSCENDENT HINTS. IN THE LAST CHAPTERS JUNG DOESWHAT MOST SCIENTISTS WOULD FIND UNTHINKABLE. HE SPECULATES ON THE POSSIBILITY OFTHE PSYCHE’S PERSISTENCE AFTER DEATH: “THERE ARE MANY HUMAN BEINGS WHOTHROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES AND AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH LAG BEHIND THEIR OWNPOTENTIALITIES. . . . HENCE THEIR DEMAND TO ATTAIN IN DEATH THAT SHARE OFAWARENESS WHICH THEY FAILED TO WIN IN LIFE.” ACCORDING TO JUNG, THESE SPIRITS ORSHADES TRY “TO PENETRATE INTO LIFE IN ORDER TO SHARE IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MEN.”WAS MY GRANDMOTHER SUCH A SPIRIT?COULD JUNG—AND THE BWITI—BE RIGHT?DOES THE PSYCHE SURVIVE, IN SOME FORM, AFTER DEATH?AND WHAT WAS IBOGA’S ROLE IN ALL THIS?. . .A FEW DAYS AFTER THE SECOND BWITI CEREMONY, I RETURNED TO NEW YORK CITY. ATHOME, I FOUND THAT I NEEDED SEVERAL HOURS LESS SLEEP A NIGHT. IT WAS AS IF IWERE CONSTANTLY CAFFEINATED, AND THIS ENERGIZED STATE LASTED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.WITH SO MUCH EXTRA TIME, I KEPT MULLING OVER THE FACETS OF THE INITIATION—THEGREEDY SHAMAN, THE SHAKY BOTANIST, THE REVELATORY PLANT.IBOGA DID NOT SHOW ME MUCH OF THE AFRICAN SPIRITUAL COSMOS, BUT IT REVEALED MYOWN INNER WORLD. FOR A FEW HOURS I WAS GRANTED A POWERFUL LENS THROUGH WHICH ICOULD SEE MY LIFE—THAT COMPLEX ASSEMBLAGE OF HABITS, MOODS, PAST EVENTS, ANDRELATIONSHIPS—LIKE A CONSTELLATION VIEWED THROUGH A TELESCOPE.I STILL WANTED TO KNOW WHAT TOUCHERS COULD TEACH."},{"pageContent":"[images/00007.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7TREACHEROUSEXCRESCENCES[images/00006.jpg] ONCE A FAVORITE DESTINATION FOR HIPPIES AND BOHEMIANWANDERERS, HUAUTLA DE JIMÉNEZ HAS BEEN OUT OF FASHION FOR SO LONG THAT THE TOWNDOES NOT EVEN RATE A MENTION IN THE LATEST LONELY PLANET GUIDES. HUAUTLA WASBROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE MODERN WORLD WHEN AN ARTICLE APPEARED IN LIFEMAGAZINE ON JUNE 10, 1957: “SEEKING THE MAGIC MUSHROOM: A NEW YORK BANKER GOESTO MEXICO’S MOUNTAINS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AGE-OLD RITUALS OF INDIANS WHO CHEWSTRANGE GROWTHS THAT PRODUCE VISIONS.”THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE, R. GORDON WASSON, WAS A VICE PRESIDENT OF J. P.MORGAN; HE AND HIS RUSSIAN WIFE, VALENTINA, WERE ALSO AMATEUR MYCOLOGISTS. WITHTHEIR IMPRESSIVE ERUDITION, SLAVIC INSPIRATION, AND MANDARIN STYLE, THE WASSONSWERE THE GREAT NABOKOVIAN FIGURES OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY PSYCHEDELIA—SUBSTITUTINGMUSHROOMS FOR BUTTERFLIES. THEY DISCOVERED THEIR VOCATION ACCIDENTALLY, WHENWASSON COULD NOT MATCH HIS WIFE’S ENTHUSIASM FOR A GROUP OF EDIBLE TOADSTOOLSSHE PICKED IN THE WOODS OUTSIDE THEIR HOME IN THE CATSKILLS MOUNTAINS OF NEWYORK. SHE INSISTED ON EATING THE FUNGI SHE HAD FOUND; HE FEARED SHE WASCOMMITTING SUICIDE.“LIKE ALL GOOD ANGLO-SAXONS,” WASSON WROTE, “I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE FUNGALWORLD AND FELT THAT THE LESS I KNEW ABOUT THOSE PUTRID, TREACHEROUS EXCRESCENCESTHE BETTER.” FOR HIS WIFE, ON THE OTHER HAND, “THEY WERE THINGS OF GRACE,INFINITELY INVITING TO THE PERCEPTIVE MIND.”THE WASSONS WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAD SUCH OPPOSED REACTIONS, AND THISQUIZZICAL CHALLENGE MUSHROOMED INTO A LIFETIME QUEST. THEY DISCOVERED THAT THESPLIT BETWEEN MYCOPHILES AND MYCOPHOBES WAS A DEEP DIVIDE AMONG EUROPEANCULTURES. RESEARCHING LINGUISTIC CLUES AND FOLKLORE, THEY FOUND AN “AURA OF THESUPERNATURAL IN WHICH ALL THE FUNGI SEEM TO BE BATHED.” THE HIDDEN TRACES OFMYTHICAL MUSHROOMS SEEMED TO UNFOLD THROUGHOUT EUROPEAN HISTORY, LEADING THEWASSONS TO A WILD SPECULATION: “ALL OF OUR EVIDENCE TAKEN TOGETHER LED US MANYYEARS AGO TO HAZARD A BOLD SURMISE: WAS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT, LONG AGO, LONGBEFORE THE BEGINNINGS OF WRITTEN HISTORY, OUR ANCESTORS HAD WORSHIPPED A DIVINEMUSHROOM?” THE WASSONS CAME TO SUSPECT THAT THE “DIVINE MUSHROOM” WAS AT THEPRELITERATE ORIGIN OF ALL HUMAN RELIGION.BUT WHY WOULD ANYBODY WORSHIP A MUSHROOM? THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BROUGHTTHEM TO THE REMOTE REACHES OF MEXICO, FOLLOWING FAINT RUMORS OF A STILL-EXTANTMUSHROOM CULT AMONG THE MAZATEC INDIANS. AFTER A SERIES OF FALSE STARTS, THEYPURCHASED SOME SPECIMENS OF PSILOCYBE MEXICANA AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE SKILLEDCURANDERA MARIA SABINA. “SHE WAS MIDDLE-AGED, AND SHORT LIKE ALL MIXETECOS, WITHA SPIRITUALITY IN HER EXPRESSION THAT STRUCK AT ONCE. SHE HAD PRESENCE. WESHOWED OUR MUSHROOMS TO THE WOMAN AND THE DAUGHTER. THEY CRIED OUT IN RAPTUREOVER THE FIRMNESS, THE FRESH BEAUTY OF OUR YOUNG SPECIMENS. THROUGH ANINTERPRETER WE ASKED IF THEY WOULD SERVE US THAT NIGHT. THEY SAID YES.”THEY ATE THE MUSHROOMS IN TOTAL DARKNESS, WITH THE SHAMANESS AND HER DAUGHTERSINGING BESIDE THEM. DURING HIS FIRST SESSIONS WASSON SAW EXTREMELY DETAILEDLANDSCAPES AND FIGURES—“A MYTHOLOGICAL BEAST DRAWING A REGAL CHARIOT”—AS WELL ASABSTRACT PATTERNS AND COLORFUL GEOMETRIES. HE WAS ASTOUNDED BY THE PRECISION OFTHE VISIONS, WHICH WERE NOT DREAMLIKE AT ALL; IF ANYTHING, THEY SEEMED MORE REALTO HIM, MORE OBJECTIVE AND ACCURATE, THAN THE WORLD BEHELD THROUGH NORMAL SIGHT.“I FELT THAT I WAS NOW SEEING PLAIN, WHEREAS ORDINARY VISION GIVES US ANIMPERFECT VIEW; I WAS SEEING THE ARCHETYPES, THE PLATONIC IDEAS, THAT UNDERLIETHE IMPERFECT IMAGES OF EVERYDAY LIFE. THE THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND: COULD THEDIVINE MUSHROOMS BE THE SECRET THAT LAY BEHIND THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES? COULD THEMIRACULOUS MOBILITY THAT I WAS NOW ENJOYING BE THE EXPLANATION FOR THE FLYINGWITCHES THAT PLAYED SO IMPORTANT A PART IN THE FOLKLORE AND FAIRY TALES OFNORTHERN EUROPE?” WASSON FELT REMOVED FROM ANY POSSIBILITY OF CONTACT WITH THEVISIONS SHOWN TO HIM. HE BECAME “A DISEMBODIED EYE, INVISIBLE, INCORPOREAL,SEEING BUT NOT SEEN.”THE BEMUSHROOMED STATE WAS NOTHING LIKE INTOXICATION IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OFTHE TERM. DESPITE THE VISIONARY AND SENSORY OVERLOAD, WASSON NOTED THAT HISRATIONAL INTELLECT REMAINED INTACT THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY: “THE MIND IS ATTACHEDAS BY AN ELASTIC CORD TO THE VAGRANT SENSES.”IN ONE OF THEIR FIRST SÉANCES WITH THE MAZATECS, THE WASSONS WITNESSED ADEMONSTRATION OF ACCURATE CLAIRVOYANCE. AFTER EATING THIRTEEN PAIRS OFMUSHROOMS, THE SHAMAN AURELIA CARRERAS TOLD THEM THAT A RELATIVE WOULD BECOMECRITICALLY ILL WITHIN A YEAR, THAT THEIR SON WAS IN TROUBLE AND MIGHT SOON JOINTHE ARMY—ALL OF WHICH, TO THE WASSONS’ SHOCK, THEY LATER VERIFIED. THEYINTENTIONALLY OMITTED THIS EPISODE FROM THEIR EARLY ACCOUNTS. “I HAD ALWAYS HADA HORROR OF THOSE WHO PREACHED A KIND OF PSEUDORELIGION OF TELEPATHY, WHO FOR MEWERE UNRELIABLE PEOPLE, AND IF OUR DISCOVERIES IN MEXICO, INCLUDING OUR INITIALVELADA [CEREMONY], WERE TO BE DRAWN TO THEIR ATTENTION WE WERE IN DANGER OFBEING ADOPTED BY SUCH UNDESIRABLES,” WASSON WROTE DECADES LATER, STILL PONDERINGON THE MYSTERY OF IT: “THE ENTHEOGEN, AT LEAST WHEN TAKEN BY A WISE SHAMAN . . .CONVEYS INFORMATION, BUT HOW?”AFTER HIS DISCOVERY OF PSILOCYBIN, WASSON CONTINUED HIS SCHOLARLY WORK ONMUSHROOMS AROUND THE WORLD. HE FOUND HINTS OF PSYCHEDELIC OR ENTHEOGENIC(“GOD-RELEASING”) MUSHROOMS IN GENESIS, IN THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES, AND IN THEHINDU SACRED TEXT, THE RIG VEDA. DESPITE HIS REVELATIONS AMONG THE MAZATECS, HEBECAME CONVINCED THAT THE ESSENTIAL ENTHEOGEN OF THE ANCIENT WORLD WASSOMA—AMANITA MUSCARIA, WHICH CONTAINS THE PSYCHOACTIVE AGENT MUSCARINE RATHERTHAN PSILOCYBIN. HE ALSO SUSPECTED THAT AN ENTHEOGENIC PLANT MAY HAVE CATALYZEDOUR ANCESTORS’ PSYCHIC EVOLUTION: A PRODIGIOUS EXPANSION IN MAN’S MEMORY MUST HAVE BEEN THE GIFT THATDIFFERENTIATED MANKIND FROM HIS PREDECESSORS, AND I SURMISE THAT THIS EXPANSIONIN MEMORY LED TO A SIMULTANEOUS GROWTH IN THE GIFT OF LANGUAGE, THESE TWO POWERSGENERATING IN MAN THAT SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS THE THIRD OF THE TRIUNETRAITS THAT ALONE MAKE MAN UNIQUE. . . . I AM ASKING MYSELF WHETHER SOMA COULDHAVE POSSESSED THE POWER TO SPARK WHAT I HAVE CALLED THESE TRIUNE TRAITS. IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT MIDDLE-CLASS READERS OF LIFE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ASTHEY READ ABOUT MYSTICAL REVELATIONS PRODUCED IN AN ELOQUENT WASP BANKER BYEATING A HANDFUL OF FOUL-TASTING MUSHROOMS WITH A BUNCH OF PRIMITIVE INDIANS.WASSON’S ARTICLE WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF CULTURAL SHOCKS THAT WOULD CULMINATE,TEN YEARS LATER, IN THE SHORT-CIRCUITED FIREWORKS OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,ALTHOUGH WASSON, IRONICALLY, CAME TO DEPLORE THE PUBLIC FASCINATION WITH THE“SACRED CHILDREN,” AS SABINA CALLED THE MUSHROOMS. WHEN TIMOTHY LEARY VISITEDHIM IN THE EARLY 1960S, LEARY WAS PERPLEXED BY THE BANKER’S NEGATIVE ATTITUDE.“WASSON WAS OPPOSED TO ANY CURRENT USE OF THE MUSHROOMS,” LEARY RECALLED.“ALTHOUGH THESE FUNGI HAD PRODUCED ALL OF THE GREAT PHILOSOPHIC VISIONS OFANTIQUITY, HE PROCLAIMED THEY HAD NO RELEVANCE TO THE MODERN WORLD.” IN THEAFTERMATH OF WASSON’S ARTICLE, HUAUTLA BECAME A TOURIST DESTINATION FOR THECOUNTERCULTURE AND SABINA BECAME THE WORLD-FAMOUS FIGUREHEAD FOR INDIGENOUSSHAMANISM—EVEN THE BEATLES VISITED HER.. . .A YEAR AFTER MY TRIP TO GABON, I WENT TO HUAUTLA WITH LAURA, MY GIRLFRIEND.UNDETERRED BY MY ROUGH TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE KING, I HAD CONTINUEDREADING ABOUT SHAMANISM AND WAS EAGER TO MEET MORE SHAMANS. WE DROVE FOR TWODAYS, THROUGH EVER-CHANGING LANDSCAPES, BENEATH STONY RIDGES OF GIANT CACTI WITHCLUMPS OF SPINDLES LIKE FINGERS POINTING ACCUSINGLY AT THE SUN.AT ONE POINT—A SUDDEN FLASH OF ROADSIDE HORROR—WE PASSED THE CARCASS OF A HORSE,BLIND EYE STARING OUT AT ME, AS A FLOCK OF VULTURES DEVOURED ITS FLESH. FROM DRYDESERT LAND WE ENTERED THE DEEP FORESTED VALLEYS AND HIGH MOUNTAIN PEAKS OF THEMAZATEC REGION. FOR SIX HOURS WE FOLLOWED A NARROW ROAD—THE ONLY ROAD TOHUAUTLA—WINDING AROUND HIGH CLIFFS WITH NUMEROUS BLIND SPOTS AND NO GUARD RAIL,PASSING LITTLE SHRINES FOR THOSE WHO HAD PLUMMETED OFF THE EDGE. LARGE ROCKSSEEMED TO TUMBLE OFF THE MOUNTAIN WITH ALARMING FREQUENCY. LAURA, WHO WASDRIVING, NAVIGATED AROUND THESE BOULDERS AND THE UNREPAIRED CRATERS THEY HADLEFT. THE REMOTE AREA HAD A QUALITY OF STILLNESS THAT REMINDED ME OF GABON.BECAUSE THE MAZATEC COUNTRY IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS, THE INDIANS HAVE PRESERVEDTHEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE—AN ESTIMATED HALF OF THE FORTY THOUSAND MAZATECSLIVING IN THE MOUNTAINOUS LAND BEYOND HUAUTLA DON’T SPEAK SPANISH.IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO BUY WHITE DRESSES AND BLOUSES EMBROIDERED WITH MUSHROOMSIN HUAUTLA’S SLEEPY LOCAL SHOPS, AS WELL AS POSTERS OF SABINA. BUT THE SIZZLE ISGONE FROM THE HIPPIE TOURIST INDUSTRY. AS FAR AS WE COULD TELL, WE WERE ALMOSTTHE ONLY WESTERNERS AROUND. THE TOWN ITSELF, LIKE OUR HOTEL, WAS ROUGH,FUNCTIONAL, AND UGLY. THE HOTEL WAS PLAIN, CONCRETE-WALLED, WITH A SEPTIC SMELL.FROM OUR BALCONY, WE WATCHED A PARADE OF MAZATEC WOMEN MARCHING IN A SAINT’S DAYFESTIVAL THROUGH THE CROWDED MARKET SQUARE. THEY WORE COLORFUL OUTFITS, CHANTED,AND CARRIED SHEAVES OF GREEN LEAVES IN THEIR HANDS.WE WENT IN SEARCH OF THE HOUSE OF MARIA SABINA; I HAD READ THAT IT WAS PRESERVEDAS A SHRINE. WE HAD ONLY VAGUE DIRECTIONS, BUT AS WE WERE RIDING UP THE HILL, ANINDIAN BOY STOPPED US TO ASK IF WE COULD GIVE HIM A LIFT. IN THE CAR, HE TOLD USTHAT HIS FATHER WAS THE SON OF MARIA SABINA, ALSO A SHAMAN IN THE FAMILYTRADITION. SABINA’S HOUSE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAMILY COMPOUND, ON A HILLTOPRIDGE OVERLOOKING THE TOWN ON ONE SIDE AND A DEEP, WIDE VALLEY ON THE OTHER. THEBOY SHOWED US A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS FATHER IN A BOOK ON MAZATEC SHAMANS. HE ASKEDIF WE WANTED A CEREMONY. I SAID YES, IF IT WAS POSSIBLE. THE PRICE WAS AROUND$70.THE CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED THAT NIGHT. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MYSELF AND CARLOS,A YOUNG MEXICAN OF SPANISH DESCENT FROM MEXICO CITY WHO LOOKED LIKE A CLUB KIDBUT WAS A STUDENT OF ALTERNATIVE HEALING—LAURA BOWED OUT OF TAKING THEMUSHROOMS. LUCKILY FOR ME, CARLOS SPOKE ENGLISH. HE SAID HE HAD VISITED THESHAMAN BEFORE. HE WAS STAYING THERE FOR A FEW NIGHTS, IN MARIA SABINA’S SIMPLEWHITE CLAPBOARD HOUSE, WHICH LOOKED LIKE A PREFAB UNIT FROM THE 1960S.WE WAITED FOR FILOGONIA, THE SHAMAN, ON THE LOW WOODEN BENCHES OF THE TEMPLE,WHICH WAS A LARGE WOODEN SHACK. THE ALTAR INCLUDED CANDLES, FLOWERS, STONES, ANDA MIX OF ICONS OF SAINTS AND THE VIRGIN MARY. A CARVED WOODEN CHRIST ON THECROSS HAD A DISTINCTLY INDIAN LOOK. EVENTUALLY, FILOGONIA ARRIVED WEARING AGRAY, HOODED SWEATSHIRT AND SMOKING A CIGARETTE. HE WAS A SMALL BUTROBUST-LOOKING MAN WITH TOUGH, DARK SKIN AND AN INCREDIBLE FACE—WISE, TORMENTED,GNOMIC. THE MUSHROOMS WERE PASSED OUT. TEN LITTLE GREEN BULBS FLOATED IN ASTEAMING BROTH. LAURA WAS SHOCKED BY THEIR FLUORESCENT COLOR ANDEXTRATERRESTRIAL LOOK. I CHEWED AND DRANK THEM DOWN; THE TASTE WAS INOFFENSIVE.“WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU TAKE THE MUSHROOMS IN YOUR COUNTRY?” FILOGONIA ASKEDME, THROUGH CARLOS. I TOLD HIM WE OFTEN WALKED AROUND AND LOOKED AT NATURE.THE SHAMAN CHANTED FOR A TIME IN MAZATEC, AN ARCHAIC AND ASIATIC-SOUNDINGLANGUAGE. HE CAME AROUND WITH THE COPAL WE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO BUY, A SWEET ANDPUNGENT INCENSE, AND BATHED US IN ITS SMOKE. HE BLEW HIS TOBACCO-SCENTED BREATHINTO OUR FACES. THE CEREMONY BORROWED ELEMENTS FROM THE CATHOLIC MASS. FORWHATEVER REASON, THAT NIGHT THE MUSHROOMS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON ME—MY SENSESAWAKENED TO THE WORLD AROUND ME, BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE DEEP VISIONARYREALMS DESCRIBED BY WASSON, WHO HAD WATCHED “PELLUCID WATER FLOWING THROUGH ANENDLESS EXPANSE OF REEDS DOWN TO A MEASURELESS SEA . . . A WOMAN IN PRIMITIVECOSTUME, STANDING AND STARING ACROSS THE WATER, ENIGMATIC, BEAUTIFUL.”CARLOS, ON THE OTHER HAND, BEGAN TO WEEP OPENLY. HE BEGGED GOD FOR MERCY. HECALLED THE SHAMAN “PADRE,” ADDRESSING HIM LIKE A PRIEST, AND ASKED FOR HISBLESSING. HIS VOICE SHAKING, HE CONFESSED RECENT SINS AND BEGGED FORGIVENESS.FILOGONIA SHRUGGED AND SMILED SHYLY. HE TOOK US OUTSIDE AND WALKED US AROUND THEFAMILY’S PROPERTY. AFFECTED BY THE MUSHROOMS, I REALIZED THIS RIDGE WAS ASACRED, OR AT LEAST A PRIVILEGED, ANCESTRAL SPOT. I WONDERED HOW MANY CENTURIESTHE SABINA FAMILY HAD LIVED HERE BEFORE WASSON DISCOVERED THEM. THE LITTLELIGHTS OF THE TOWN GLIMMERED BELOW US. THE STARS SPIRALED ACROSS THE SKYOVERHEAD. A MULE WATCHED US PEACEFULLY. THE SHAMAN OCCASIONALLY MADE LITTLEMOVEMENTS WITH HIS HANDS, LIKE THE ROBOT GESTURES OF BREAKDANCERS. THIS WAS THEFIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THE “SHAMANIC PASSES” DESCRIBED BY MICHAEL HARNER ANDCARLOS CASTANEDA. AT MOMENTS HE LOOKED WEARY, HEARTBROKEN, CLOSE TO TEARS, BUTHIS EXPRESSION WOULD CHANGE, AND HE WOULD LAUGH.IT WAS, FOR ME, ANOTHER UNVISIONARY TRIP. I CURSED MY HARD HEAD. ALTHOUGH IVISITED NO OTHER REALMS—NO TRACE OF THE BEJEWELED STARSHIP FACTORIES OR STROBINGBUDDHA LANDS I HAD SEEN SEVERAL TIMES ON LARGE DOSES OF DRIED MUSHROOMS IN NEWYORK—MY SENSES OPENED TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD, AND AS LAURA DROVE US BACK TO THEHOTEL, I FELT THE SADNESS OF HUAUTLA. THE TOWN HAD BEEN CHEAPLY AND BRUTALLYHEWED OUT OF MOUNTAIN ROCK WITH LITTLE THOUGHT FOR THE PEOPLE FORCED TO INHABITIT. IT WAS A GRIM EXTRACTION POINT FOR WHATEVER CAPITAL COULD BE SUCKED FROMTHIS THIRD WORLD BACKWATER. THE SMELL OF CHEAP GASOLINE HUNG IN THE AIR. I WASGLAD THAT THE REGION’S INACCESSIBILITY HAD PRESERVED THE MAZATEC CULTURE. WEDROVE BACK TO THE CITY OF OAXACA THE NEXT DAY.FROM HUAUTLA, THE MUSHROOMS ENTERED WORLD CONSCIOUSNESS. EVENTUALLY, MARIASABINA BELIEVED THAT THE FOREIGNERS RUINED THE POWER OF THE MUSHROOMS. LIKE MOSTINDIGENOUS GROUPS, THE MAZATECS ONLY CONSULTED THE SACRED PLANTS WHEN THEYNEEDED HEALING OR GUIDANCE. THE NEW ENTHUSIASTS CONSUMED THEM INDISCRIMINATELY.AFTER WASSON, SABINA PERFORMED MANY CEREMONIES FOR WESTERNERS SEEKING SPIRITUALINSIGHT OR LOOKING FOR KICKS. “FROM THE MOMENT THE FOREIGNERS CAME TO FIND GOD,THE SACRED CHILDREN LOST THEIR PURITY,” SHE SAID IN HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY. “THEYLOST THEIR FORCE, ONE HAS SPOILED THEM. FROM NOW ON, THEY WILL NO LONGER HAVE ANEFFECT. THERE IS NOTHING ONE CAN DO ABOUT IT.”AND YET, HALF A CENTURY LATER, THE POPULARITY OF SABINA’S “SACRED CHILDREN”CONTINUES, QUIETLY, TO SPREAD ACROSS THE MODERN WORLD. DESPITE THE ILLEGALSTATUS OF THE MUSHROOMS IN THE WEST, INCREASING NUMBERS OF ENTHUSIASTS GROWTHEIR OWN IN BASEMENT JARS. RECENTLY I HAVE HEARD CREDIBLE REPORTS OF PSILOCYBINENTHUSIASTS, NEOPAGAN NATURE CULTISTS, WHO TRAVEL ACROSS THE WORLD SPREADING THESPORES AROUND FORESTS AND PUBLIC PARKS, WHERE THEY ENTER THE LOCAL ECOSYSTEM.SPECIES OF THE MUSHROOMS NOW GROW PLENTIFULLY IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON STATE ANDOTHER AREAS WHERE THEY WERE NOT KNOWN BEFORE. A HALF CENTURY AFTER THE WASSONS’INITIATION, THE DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE HAS NOT ENDED. I BEGAN MY OWNPSYCHEDELIC EDUCATION AS ONE OF ITS MANY BENEFICIARIES."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8PROFANE ILLUMINATIONS[images/00006.jpg] I FIRST TRIED MUSHROOMS AT WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, A PRIVATECOLLEGE IN CONNECTICUT. AN UNHAPPY NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD, I KEPT TYING MYSELF INTODEEPER PSYCHOLOGICAL AND INTELLECTUAL KNOTS. I WAS TAKING A SEMINAR ON THE WORKOF JACQUES LACAN, WHO TURNED FREUD’S IDEAS INTO SEDUCTIVE GIBBERISH. OUR TEACHERWAS A CHIC PRESENCE, A TWENTY-EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SCOTTISH WOMAN WHO WORE ANTIQUEGOWNS AND RESEMBLED BETTE DAVIS, CHAIN-SMOKED DURING CLASS, AND DRANK HERSELF TODEATH A FEW YEARS LATER. LACAN WROTE ABOUT LOST OBJECTS OF DESIRE THAT COULDNEVER BE RECAPTURED AND “THE CRISIS OF THE REAL.” HE DESCRIBED HOW THE SEXUALACT NEVER TOOK PLACE. HIS CONTORTED CONCEPTS SEEMED PAINFULLY PERSUASIVE TO MEAT THE TIME.THERE WAS A STRONG PSYCHEDELIC UNDERCURRENT AT WESLEYAN, BUT IT WASN’T MY STYLE.A GROUP OF PREP SCHOOL KIDS IN TIE-DYED T-SHIRTS SPENT THEIR WEEKENDS PURSUINGTHE GRATEFUL DEAD UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST. I HAD GROWN UP AROUND THE NEW WAVESCENE IN NEW YORK, AND THE GRATEFUL DEAD’S TWANGLING BLUES SEEMED UNBEARABLYOUTDATED AND SUBURBAN TO ME. ONE WINTRY DAY MY FRIEND ALEX—SHE WAS SEVERAL YEARSOLDER THAN ME, AN ART STUDENT—BROUGHT ME TO HER HOUSE AND GAVE ME SOMEMUSHROOMS. THE MUSHROOMS WERE DRIED SHARDS OF STEMS AND CAPS WITH AN ACRIDTASTE. WE ATE THEM AND WALKED AROUND THE CAMPUS, STARING AT ICICLES THATDESCENDED LIKE GLITTERING DAGGERS FROM ROOF LEDGES AND TREE BRANCHES. I FELTFIZZY, LIGHT. MY SENSES SEEMED TO BE TUNING UP, TAKING IN STRAY BITS OF REALITYTHAT I WOULD HAVE IGNORED OTHERWISE. I BOUGHT A SODA AT A DELI AND GIGGLED AS IPULLED A CLUMP OF DOLLAR BILLS FROM MY POCKET. WHAT WAS THIS NASTY STUFF?SUDDENLY I COULD NOT FATHOM THE SOCIAL PROCESS THAT MADE THESE WRINKLED BITS OFDIRTY PAPER SO IMPORTANT. IT SEEMED RIDICULOUS AND ARBITRARY.FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MUSHROOMS, THE WORLD REVEALED DIFFERENT PRIORITIES.TREES AND PLANTS GLOWED WITH PATIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE, AS IF EXPRESSING ADEEPER WISDOM. THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS WERE EITHER MODERNIST PRISONS OR POMPOUSATTEMPTS AT ARCHITECTURAL MEANING; THE COLLONADED FACADE OF OLIN LIBRARY, FORINSTANCE, WAS TRYING FAR TOO HARD. CARS AND JUNK-FOOD PACKAGING AND EVERYTHINGELSE THAT WAS FACTORY-MADE AND SHINY SEEMED LIKE AGGRESSIVE OVERKILL. THE“CONSENSUS REALITY” OF THE UNIVERSITY, OF LATE-TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICA INGENERAL, SEEMED DUBIOUSLY PRESUMPTUOUS AND INSUBSTANTIAL.LATER I MADE THE MISTAKE OF WRITING ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS AT WESLEYAN. I LIVED INWEST COLLEGE, THE BOHEMIAN AND HIPPIE DORM. EACH YEAR, WESTCO HELD TWOFESTIVALS, UNCLE DUKE DAY AND ZONKER HARRIS DAY, THAT HAD A FUN-HOUSEATMOSPHERE. THESE EVENTS WERE DESIGNED FOR TRIPPING. THE HALLS ORGANIZED LITTLEEVENTS—DAY-GLO FACE PAINTING OR AMBIENT CONCERTS—THAT WOULD APPEAL TO STONEDKIDS WITH BRIGHT EYES WANDERING THROUGH THE HALLS AND UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. FORTHE ARGUS, THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER, I DESCRIBED THE GOINGS-ON AND THEORIZED UNCLEDUKE DAY AS AN EXAMPLE OF “REPRESSIVE TOLERANCE,” A PHRASE COINED BY PHILOSOPHERHERBERT MARCUSE IN THE 1960S. UNDER A REGIME OF “REPRESSIVE TOLERANCE,”INDIVIDUALS ARE ALLOWED FREEDOM THAT HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF ALL POLITICAL MEANING.MY EDITOR FORGOT THAT THE PAPER WENT TO HUNDREDS OF PARENT SUBSCRIBERS, AND SOMEOF THEM WERE IRATE. THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN “REPRESSIVE TOLERANCE.” THEYPREFERRED SIMPLE REPRESSION, AND DEMANDED THAT THE EVENTS BE OUTLAWED.. . .I STARTED READING WALTER BENJAMIN AROUND THAT TIME. BENJAMIN IS THE KIND OFTHINKER FOR WHOM I HAVE A PERHAPS FATAL WEAKNESS. HE COULD NOT STOP HIMSELF FROMTRYING TO THINK THROUGH EVERYTHING AT ONCE—FASHION, MARXISM, PSYCHOANALYSIS,WALT DISNEY, HISTORY, AND THE MIMETIC NATURE OF LANGUAGE, TO NAME ONLY A FEW.THIS TYPE OF THINKING IS MY OWN HABITUAL CURSE. AT WESLEYAN, IN THE MIDST OF ACRISIS OF ALIENATION, I KEPT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MY LIFE AT THE UNIVERSITY ASIF I WERE SOME KIND OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL SOCIAL SCIENTIST OBSERVING THE CULTUREAROUND ME. THIS EFFORT MADE ME FEEL TRAPPED OUTSIDE OF MYSELF, A WITNESS RATHERTHAN A PARTICIPANT EVEN IN MY OWN PRIVATE DRAMA. NEITHER BENJAMIN NORPSYCHEDELIC DRUGS HELPED TO END MY DESPERATION AT THAT POINT.MORE THAN A DECADE LATER, I HAD THE CHANCE TO STUDY BENJAMIN IN A GRADUATECOURSE AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. EACH WEEK, TWENTY OF US MET IN THE OFFICE OF THEANTHROPOLOGIST MICHAEL TAUSSIG. UNDER TINGLING GRAY FLUORESCENTS, WE HUNCHEDOVER COPIES OF BENJAMIN’S UNFINISHED MAGNUM OPUS, THE ARCADES PROJECT, TWELVEHUNDRED PAGES OF QUOTES, APHORISMS, AND FRAGMENTS.BENJAMIN’S WRITING FLASHES BETWEEN POLES OF REVOLUTION AND REVELATION. A SCHOLAROF THRESHOLD EXPERIENCES, STATES OF INTOXICATION, AND FAILED PHILOSOPHIES, HE ISBRILLIANT ON THE SUBJECT OF DRUGS: “THE MOST PASSIONATE EXAMINATION OF THEHASHISH TRANCE WILL NOT TEACH US HALF AS MUCH ABOUT THINKING (WHICH IS EMINENTLYNARCOTIC), AS THE PROFANE ILLUMINATION OF THINKING ABOUT THE HASHISH TRANCE,” HEWROTE. “THE READER, THE THINKER, THE FLANEUR, ARE TYPES OF ILLUMINATI JUST ASMUCH AS THE OPIUM EATER, THE DREAMER, THE ECSTATIC. . . . NOT TO MENTION THATMOST TERRIBLE DRUG—OURSELVES—WHICH WE TAKE IN SOLITUDE.”HE SAW THINKING AS A FORM OF INTOXICATION. HE RECOGNIZED THAT DRUG-EXPLORATION,THE PURSUIT OF VISIONARY EXPERIENCE, COULD BE AN EXTENSION OF A RATIONAL ANDINTELLECTUAL QUEST: “THE DIALECTICS OF INTOXICATION ARE INDEED CURIOUS,” HEWROTE. “IS NOT PERHAPS ALL ECSTASY IN ONE WORLD HUMILIATING SOBRIETY IN THATCOMPLEMENTARY TO IT?”WRITING IN THE 1920S AND 1930S, BENJAMIN SMOKED HASH, TRIED MESCALINE, ANDENJOYED HIS OWN TRIPS: “I THOUGHT WITH INTENSE PRIDE OF SITTING HERE INMARSEILLES IN A HASHISH TRANCE; OF WHO ELSE MIGHT BE SHARING MY INTOXICATIONTHIS EVENING, HOW FEW.” THINKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HASHISH WAS LIKEUNROLLING A BALL OF THREAD THROUGH A MAZE: “WE GO FORWARD; BUT IN SO DOING WENOT ONLY DISCOVER THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THE CAVE, BUT ALSO ENJOY THE PLEASUREOF THIS DISCOVERY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE OTHER, RHYTHMICAL BLISS OFUNWINDING THE THREAD.”ON HASHISH, HE SAW THE ELABORATE FURNISHINGS OF THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY BOURGEOISINTERIOR CONCENTRATING “TO SATANIC CONTENTMENT, SATANIC KNOWING, SATANIC CALM .. . TO LIVE IN THESE INTERIORS WAS TO HAVE WOVEN A DENSE FABRIC ABOUT ONESELF,TO HAVE SECLUDED ONESELF WITHIN A SPIDER’S WEB, IN WHOSE TOILS WORLD EVENTS HANGLOOSELY SUSPENDED LIKE SO MANY INSECT BODIES SUCKED DRY. FROM THE CAVERN, ONEDOES NOT LIKE TO STIR.” THE NARCOTIC TRANCE REVEALED AN OCCULT AND SINISTERUNDERCURRENT TO THE BOURGEOIS LOVE OF COMFORT AND EXOTIC DECOR.FOR THE SOCIETY AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL, BENJAMIN REALIZED “THE IMPORTANCE OFINTOXICATION FOR PERCEPTION, OF FICTION FOR THINKING.” THE NEW CONSUMER CULTUREOF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY INDUCED A WIDESPREAD TRANCE IN THE PUBLIC, ASCAPITALISM BREATHED SUPERNATURAL POWER INTO ITS PRODUCTS. THE WORLD EXHIBITS,THE BELLE EPOQUE’S CELEBRATIONS OF GLOBAL COMMERCE, “OPEN UP A PHANTASMAGORIATHAT PEOPLE ENTER TO BE AMUSED. THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY FACILITATES THIS BYELEVATING PEOPLE TO THE STATUS OF COMMODITIES. THEY SUBMIT TO BEING MANIPULATEDWHILE ENJOYING THEIR ALIENATION FROM THEMSELVES AND OTHERS.” THE EUPHORIAINDUCED BY THESE SPECTACLES WAS LIKE A DRUG THAT ROBBED THE MASSES OF THEIRWILL, THAT TAUGHT THEM HOW TO ENJOY BEING TRANSFORMED INTO OBJECTS OF EXCHANGE.INTOXICATED, ENTRANCED BY THE NEW WORLD OF COMMODITIES, THE WEST LOST ITSCONTACT WITH THE COMMUNAL “ECSTATIC TRANCE,” THOSE ARCHAIC DIONYSIAN FESTIVALSAND ANNUAL MYSTERIES CELEBRATING THE TRANSFORMATION OF PRIMORDIAL CHAOS INTOORDER. THE LOSS OF RITUALS THAT COMPELLED “ECSTATIC CONTACT WITH THE COSMOS”POSED A THREAT TO HUMANITY: “IT IS THE DANGEROUS ERROR OF MODERN MEN TO REGARDTHIS EXPERIENCE AS UNIMPORTANT AND AVOIDABLE . . . IT IS NOT; ITS HOUR STRIKESAGAIN AND AGAIN, AND THEN NEITHER NATIONS NOR GENERATIONS CAN ESCAPE IT.”HUMANITY NEEDED SUCH PERIODIC RITES OF REGENERATION TO AVOID HYPNOTIC EPISODESOF FEVERISH DESTRUCTION, WHICH SERVED THE SAME PURPOSE AT A MUCH GREATER COST.FOR BENJAMIN, THIS WAS THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR, “AN ATTEMPTAT A NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED COMMINGLING WITH THE COSMIC POWERS.” HE WORRIED THATMANKIND’S ALIENATION FROM ITSELF WAS DEEPENING “TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT CANEXPERIENCE ITS OWN DESTRUCTION AS AN AESTHETIC PLEASURE OF THE FIRST ORDER.”BENJAMIN’S FUSION OF SOCIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOANALYTICAL, AND MYSTICAL LEVELS OFINSIGHT REMINDED ME OF THE INTEGRATED VISION OF MYSELF THAT I TOOK BACK FROM THEIBOGA TRIP. HE SAW THAT NO REVOLUTION COULD SUCCEED UNLESS IT TRANSFORMED THEINNER REALM OF THOUGHT—THE MEANING OF PERCEPTION, THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SENSESTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD—AS WELL AS ECONOMIC RELATIONS. HE WAS ALWAYS ON THELOOKOUT FOR THE SECRET CORE OF PRIMITIVE RITUAL AND MAGICAL BELIEF HIDDEN WITHINTHE SEEMINGLY “RATIONAL” PROCESSES OF MODERNITY.HE CALLED HIS GREAT UNCOMPLETED WORK THE ARCADES PROJECT “AN EXPERIMENT IN THETECHNIQUE OF AWAKENING.” ON THE PERSONAL LEVEL, AWAKENING IS, OF COURSE,SOMETHING WE DO EVERY MORNING WITHOUT A THOUGHT. WE SUDDENLY EMERGE INTOOURSELVES, ARRIVING IN OUR BEDS FROM THE EVANESCENT DREAM DIMENSIONS.OCCASIONALLY WE REMEMBER VIVID NARRATIVES AND SCENES FROM OUR UNCONSCIOUSMEANDERINGS. AT OTHER TIMES WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THE STORIES ONLY WITH AN EFFORT,SEARCHING INSIDE OUR MINDS FOR CLUES TO PATTERNS THAT QUICKLY FIZZLE OUT ANDDISAPPEAR IF WE DON’T PURSUE THEM, IF WE DON’T MAKE THE EFFORT TO RETRACE OURSTEPS THROUGH THE LABYRINTH. MOST OFTEN, WE DON’T REMEMBER ANYTHING AT ALL, ANDWE ARE HAPPIER FOR IT.BENJAMIN DESCRIBES AWAKENING AS A HISTORICAL AND GENERATIONAL PROCESS AS WELL ASAN INDIVIDUAL ONE. HISTORY IS THE EFFORT MADE BY EACH AGE TO BRING THE “NOT-YETCONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAS BEEN” INTO AWARENESS. WAKING IS A “DIALECTICALMOMENT” SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE DREAMWORLD OF THE PAST AND THE TRANSFORMATIVEENERGY LOCKED WITHIN THE PRESENT. FOR BENJAMIN, HISTORY ADVANCES IN SUDDENFLASHES AND LEAPS. IT IS A SERIES OF AWAKENINGS INTO DEEPER AND MORE PROFOUNDLEVELS OF AWARENESS, OR FALTERINGS INTO DEEPER STATES OF HYPNOSIS AND TRANCE.THIS “DIALECTIC OF AWAKENING” HAS NO END POINT. JUST AS THE INDIVIDUAL SLIPSBETWEEN SLEEP AND WAKING, REACHING DIFFERENT INTENSITIES OF AWARENESS DURING THEDAY, GENERATIONS AND EPOCHS ALSO FLUCTUATE BETWEEN LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS ANDUNCONSCIOUSNESS. ADVERTISEMENTS, POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT, PUBLIC ARCHITECTURE ARENATURAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS DESIRES OF THE “DREAMING COLLECTIVE.”UNSEDUCED BY THE IDEOLOGY OF MODERNIST PROGRESS, HE DESCRIBED CAPITALISM AS “ANATURAL PHENOMENON WITH WHICH A NEW DREAM-FILLED SLEEP CAME OVER EUROPE, AND,THROUGH IT, A REACTIVATION OF MYTHIC FORCES.” THOSE REACTIVATED MYTHIC FORCESENDED UP DESTROYING HIM: HE COMMITTED SUICIDE IN 1939, WHILE TRYING TO FLEE THENAZIS.HE DIED BEFORE HE COULD BEGIN A PROJECTED BOOK ON DRUGS. IT WOULD HAVE PERFECTLYFIT HIS INTENTION TO “CULTIVATE FIELDS WHERE, UNTIL NOW, ONLY MADNESS HASREIGNED.” PARADOXICALLY, BENJAMIN’S WORK SUGGESTS THAT ONLY INTOXICATION—ECSTASYTHAT IS ALSO “HUMILIATING SOBRIETY,” AN APT DESCRIPTION OF TRIPPING—CAN AWAKENTHE INDIVIDUAL BY SNAPPING HIM OR HER OUT OF THE MONOTONOUS TRANCE OF MODERNLIFE."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9FUN WITH FUNGI[images/00006.jpg] THE CREATION OF THE MODERN WESTERN CONSCIOUSNESS REQUIRED AVIOLENT REPRESSION OF OUR ARCHAIC HERITAGE. THAT HERITAGE INCLUDES THE ABILITYTO EXPLORE SACRED AND MAGICAL REALMS THROUGH SPONTANEOUSLY OCCURRING TRANCESTATES, THROUGH RITUALS OF INITIATION, OR THROUGH THE VISIONARY COMPOUNDS FOUNDIN CERTAIN PLANTS. FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS, DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE SACREDWAS A NATURAL AND UNIVERSAL PART OF HUMAN EXISTENCE, AS IT REMAINS TODAY INTRIBAL CULTURES. WITH THE RISE OF THE MODERN STATE AND THE CHURCH, INTERACTIONWITH MYSTICAL REALITIES WAS ALIENATED FROM THE MASSES AND EXPLICITLY DEMONIZED.COMMUNION WITH THE SACRED WAS RESERVED FOR THE PRIESTS. DURING THE INQUISITION,CAVORTING WITH THE SPIRITS OF NATURE OR CONTACTING THE SOULS OF THE DEAD BECAMEHERESIES. THE PUNISHMENT FOR THESE CRIMES WAS SEVERE.THE DIALECTICAL PROCESS THAT CREATED THE POSSESSIVE MIND-SET OF THE CAPITALISTAND THE “RATIONAL” OUTLOOK OF THE TECHNOCRAT REQUIRED DESTRUCTION OF THEPREMODERN VESTIGES OF COMMUNAL AND ANIMISTIC BELIEFS, WHETHER THESE BELIEFS WEREFOUND IN ISOLATED POCKETS OF EUROPE OR IN THE INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS OF THE NEWWORLD. THIS DESTRUCTION WAS PART OF THE PROCESS THAT KARL MARX DESCRIBED AS THEALIENATION OF ALL OF OUR PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL SENSES INTO ONE SENSE: THESENSE OF HAVING. OF COURSE, “THE SENSE OF HAVING” IS NOT REALLY A SENSE—IT IS ANILLUSION OF FULFILLMENT THAT SEEMS TO EXTEND OUTSIDE OF THE SELF.MODERNISM CAUSED A PROFOUND SHIFT IN THE WAY WE USE OUR SENSES. IN HIS BOOK MYTHAND MEANING, LÉVI-STRAUSS ADMITTED HIS INITIAL SHOCK WHEN HE DISCOVERED THATINDIAN TRIBESMEN WERE ABLE TO SEE THE PLANET VENUS IN DAYLIGHT, WITH THE NAKEDEYE—“SOMETHING THAT TO ME WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE AND INCREDIBLE.” BUT HELEARNED FROM ASTRONOMERS THAT IT WAS FEASIBLE, AND HE FOUND ANCIENT ACCOUNTS OFWESTERN NAVIGATORS WITH THE SAME ABILITY. “TODAY WE USE LESS AND WE USE MORE OFOUR MENTAL CAPACITY THAN WE DID IN THE PAST,” HE REALIZED. WE HAVE SACRIFICEDPERCEPTUAL CAPABILITIES FOR OTHER MENTAL ABILITIES—TO CONCENTRATE ON A COMPUTERSCREEN WHILE SITTING IN A CUBICLE FOR MANY HOURS AT A STRETCH (SOMETHING THOSEINDIANS WOULD FIND “UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE AND INCREDIBLE”), OR TO SHUT OFF MULTIPLELEVELS OF AWARENESS AS WE DRIVE A CAR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. IN OTHER WORDS, WE AREBROUGHT UP WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT TEACHES US TO POSTPONE, DEFER, AND ELIMINATEMOST INCOMING SENSE DATA IN FAVOR OF A FUTURE REWARD. WE LIVE IN A FEEDBACK LOOPOF PERPETUAL POSTPONEMENT. FOR THE MOST PART, WE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF WHAT WEHAVE LOST.PERSONALLY, I WAS NOT AWARE OF WHAT I WAS LOSING UNTIL I TOOK MUSHROOMS. DURINGTHOSE EARLY TRIPS I REALIZED I WAS TRAPPED IN A STATE OF DEFERRED EXPECTATIONAND COMPULSIVE SELF-DISTANCING. I HAD A NEUROTIC INTELLECTUAL’S HABIT OFCONSTANTLY TRYING TO OBSERVE MYSELF FROM SOME IMAGINARY POINT OF OBJECTIVITYOUTSIDE OF MYSELF, AND THIS IMPOSSIBLE EFFORT SAPPED MY ENERGY AND KEPT ME FROMCONNECTING TO THE PRESENT. MUSHROOMS DID NOT CURE ME OF THIS—FOR A LONG TIMEONLY ALCOHOL COULD OBLITERATE THE DIVISION, AND IT TOOK ME SOME YEARS TO RESOLVETHE PROBLEM—BUT THE BITS OF DRIED FUNGI MADE ME AWARE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, OFEXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG.THE MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS IS AWAKE TO MATERIALISM, TO THE INCORPOREAL “SENSE OFHAVING,” TO THE MECHANISTIC WORLDVIEW AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF EMPIRICALOBSERVATION. ITS ANTITHESIS IS THE ARCHAIC MIND, ALIVE TO THE WORLD OF THESENSES, IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE SACRED AS IT IS REVEALED THROUGH THE NATURALWORLD, THROUGH DREAMS AND VISIONS. FOR THIS KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS, AS HENRYMILLER ONCE PUT IT, “THE GOAL OF LIFE IS NOT TO POSSESS POWER BUT TO RADIATEIT.”THERE IS A CULTURAL SPLIT BETWEEN FOCUS ON THE BRAIN, THE MATERIAL HARDWARE INWHICH CONSCIOUSNESS OPERATES, AND STUDY OF THE MIND, THE INCORPOREAL NEXUS OFALL WE EXPERIENCE. WESTERN SCIENCE OBSESSIVELY STUDIES THE “OBJECTIVE” WORKINGSOF THE BRAIN, ITS PATHWAYS OF NEURONS AND DENSE FORESTS OF SYNAPSES, WITHOUTCOMPREHENDING THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. ARCHAIC SHAMANISM IS A TECHNOLOGY FOREXPLORING THE “SUBJECTIVE” TRUTH OF THE MIND THROUGH VISION, DREAM, MYTH, ANDINTERACTION WITH NATURE. ACCORDING TO CURRENT PSYCHIATRY, MENTAL DISORDERS HAVEPHYSICAL CAUSES THAT CAN BE TREATED, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, WITH APPROPRIATEMEDICATION. FROM THE SHAMANIC PERSPECTIVE, NOT ONLY MENTAL BUT EVEN PHYSICALDISORDERS HAVE NONPHYSICAL—SPIRITUAL—CAUSES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IF A CURE ISGOING TO BE EFFECTIVE.THE VISIONARY PLANTS ARE THE GUIDING SPIRITS OF ARCHAIC CULTURES. THEY ARESACRED BECAUSE THEY AWAKEN THE MIND TO OTHER LEVELS OF AWARENESS. THEY AREGATEWAYS TO A SPIRITUAL, OR MULTIDIMENSIONAL, UNIVERSE. IN THE MODERN WORLD, THESUBSTANCES DERIVED FROM THESE PLANTS CONTINUE TO BE DEMONIZED, RIDICULED, ANDABOVE ALL SUPPRESSED. IN THE EARLY 1960S, WHEN A REVIEWER REDUCED ALDOUSHUXLEY’S FASCINATION WITH PSYCHEDELICS TO “FUN WITH FUNGI,” HUXLEY REPLIED INSCATHING TERMS: “WHICH IS BETTER, TO HAVE FUN WITH FUNGI OR TO HAVE IDIOCY WITHIDEOLOGY, TO HAVE WARS BECAUSE OF WORDS, TO HAVE TOMORROW’S MISDEEDS OUT OFYESTERDAY’S MISCREEDS?”THIS CULTURAL SPLIT REMAINS A DEEP DIVIDE. AS I WRITE THIS, PSYCHEDELIC DRUGSHAVE BEEN DISMISSED, YET AGAIN, AS “TOYS OF THE HIPPIE GENERATION” IN THESCIENCE SECTION OF THE NEW YORK TIMES. IT SEEMS THAT NO MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPER ORMAGAZINE CAN PUBLISH AN ARTICLE ABOUT HALLUCINOGENS WITHOUT STOPPING TO RIDICULETHEM IN SOME WAY. PSYCHEDELICS, CHEMICAL CATALYSTS THAT OPEN UP INNER WORLDS,REMAIN BANISHED AND MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THEY OCCUPY THE POINT OF DIRECTCONTRADICTION AND POSSIBLE SYNTHESIS BETWEEN BRAIN-BASED MATERIALISM ANDSPIRIT-ORIENTED SHAMANISM.THE EXPLORATION AND UNBIASED STUDY OF THESE MIND-EXPANDING MOLECULES—ANINTERRUPTED LEGACY OF SCIENTIFIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH BEGUN IN THE 1950SAND SHUT DOWN WITH HYSTERICAL FORCE DURING THE LATE 1960S—IS ONE WAY TO UNIFYTHESE OPPOSITE APPROACHES TO THE NATURE OF REALITY.PERHAPS IT IS THE ONLY WAY."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10NIGHT TRAVELERS[images/00006.jpg] FOR BENJAMIN, THE RISE OF CAPITALISM WAS NOT SIMPLY ANAWAKENING OF OUR TECHNOLOGICAL AND RATIONAL POWERS. IT WAS ALSO A “NEWDREAM-FILLED SLEEP,” A SURRENDER TO DANGEROUS “MYTHIC FORCES.” REASON,RATIONALITY, AND SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM CONCEALED THEIR DARKER OPPOSITES BUT DIDNOT DISPEL THEM. IN FACT, THE MECHANISTIC IDEOLOGY OF MODERNISM, BY SUBSTITUTINGTHE COMMODITY TRANCE FOR THE “ECSTATIC TRANCE” KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS, PUTHUMANITY IN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND VULNERABLE POSITION. WRITERS OF THE PASTCENTURIES EXPLORED THIS FISSURE BETWEEN REASON AND THE IRRATIONAL BYCONCENTRATING ON THE AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF AWAKENING, THE SEDUCTIVE POWER OFDREAMS, THE MAGICAL POWER OF TRANCE STATES.NO WRITER EXPLORED THESE TRANSITORY AND IN-BETWEEN FORMS OF MENTAL LIFE WITHMORE WIT AND DARING THAN WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. IN SHAKESPEARE’S WORK, CONSCIOUSLIFE IS REVEALED, OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AS A TYPE OF TRANCE. FOR THE DURATION OFHIS PLAYS, WE SEEM TO RECOGNIZE OR REMEMBER THAT REALITY TENDS TO REVEAL ITSELFIN A SERIES OF MARVELOUS EPISODES AND PECULIAR COINCIDENCES.AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MODERN ERA, SHAKESPEARE HELPED DEFINE THE MODERNCONSCIOUSNESS—OR PERHAPS IT IS MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE MERCURIALAMBIGUITIES AND LINGUISTIC OPENNESS OF HIS WORK INDICATE A PATH THAT THE MODERNCONSCIOUSNESS DID NOT TAKE. HE WROTE HIS PLAYS AS EUROPE WAS SHAKING OFF THEANIMISTIC AND MAGICAL BELIEFS OF THE PAST. SOME OF HIS MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTSSEEM LIKE A PUBLIC STAGING OF THIS TRANSITION—FOR EXAMPLE, PROSPERO BREAKING HISSTAFF AND GIVING UP HIS POWERS AT THE END OF THE TEMPEST. “DRAMA IS BORN IN THERENUNCIATION OF MAGIC,” WROTE THE CRITIC NORTHROP FRYE, “AND IN THE TEMPEST ANDELSEWHERE IT REMEMBERS ITS INHERITANCE.”AS SHAKESPEARE WAS WRITING, WITCHES WERE BURNING IN INQUISITIONAL FIRES. INECSTASIES: DECIPHERING THE WITCHES’ SABBATH, THE HISTORIAN CARLO GINZBURGSTUDIED COURT DOCUMENTS FROM THE INQUISITION, A PAPER TRAIL OF PERSECUTIONSCROSSING THE MAP OF EUROPE. GINZBURG’S SUBVERSIVE STRATEGY WAS TO USE THEREPORTS OF THE ACCUSERS TO RECOVER THE ACTUAL BELIEF SYSTEMS AND THE VISIONARYTECHNIQUES OF THE ACCUSED. HE EXAMINED TESTIMONIES SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING, FROM ASCOTTISH WITCH TRIAL: IN 1597 ANDREW MAN TOLD THE JUDGES AT ABERDEEN THAT HE HAD PAID HOMAGE TO THEQUEEN OF THE ELVES AND TO THE DEVIL, WHO HAD APPEARED TO HIM IN THE GUISE OF ASTAG, EMERGING FROM THE SNOW ON A SUMMER’S DAY DURING THE HARVEST. HIS NAME WASCHRISTSONDAY (THE SUNDAY OF GOD). ANDREW MAN HAD KISSED ITS BEHIND. . . . THEELVES HAD SET THE TABLES WITH FOOD, PLAYED MUSIC AND DANCED. THEY WERE SHADOWS,BUT WITH THE APPEARANCE AND CLOTHES OF HUMAN BEINGS. THEIR QUEEN WAS VERYBEAUTIFUL, AND ANDREW MAN HAD COUPLED WITH HER CARNALLY. ANDREW MAN’S NIGHT OF ENCHANTMENT CALLS TO MIND A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM. FORTHE SCENES OF BOTTOM AND THE FAIRIES, SHAKESPEARE PERHAPS BORROWED SUCH A TRIALREPORT, A LIFTING FROM EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY SIMILAR TO THE USE OF ACCOUNTS OFUFO ABDUCTION STORIES IN STEVEN SPIELBERG’S CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.SHAKESPEARE ALLOWED HIS AUDIENCE OF MERCHANTS AND NOBLES TO CATHARTICALLY RELIVETHE ANIMIST AND FANTASTIC BELIEFS THEIR SOCIETY WAS IN THE PROCESS OF SHEDDING.WAKING FROM HIS AFFAIR WITH THE FAIRY QUEEN, BOTTOM SAYS, “THE EYE OF MAN HATHNOT HEARD, THE EAR OF MAN HATH NOT SEEN, MAN’S HAND IS NOT ABLE TO TASTE, HISTONGUE TO CONCEIVE, NOR HIS HEART TO REPORT, WHAT MY DREAM WAS.” FOR THE FEWHOURS OF THE SHAKESPEAREAN SPECTACLE, HIS AUDIENCE REAWAKENED TO THE ARCHAICPOWER OF MAGICAL THOUGHT—A THEATRICAL MIMESIS THAT HELPED THEM TO RECOGNIZE ANDSUPPRESS THEIR OWN ANTIQUATED BELIEFS WITH DEEPER CONVICTION. THE PLAYS HELPEDTO MARK THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE OLD FICTIONS AND THE NEW REALITIES. AS THEMODERN ERA GATHERED FORCE, ARTISTIC DEPICTIONS OF FANTASY RATHER THAN INNEREXPERIENCES OF ALTERED STATES BECAME THE ONLY WAY MOST PEOPLE PRESERVED ATENUOUS LINK TO MAGICAL REALMS. THAT REMAINS THE SITUATION TODAY.IN SHAKESPEAREAN DRAMA, MAGIC IS STAGING ITS RETREAT—A RETREAT FROM THE WORLD OFDOING INTO THE WORLD OF SAYING. HIS LANGUAGE, WITH ITS CONSTANT PLAY OF SIMILESAND METAPHORS, EXPRESSES THE ALCHEMICAL PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION. AS THESEUSDECLARES IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM: THE POET’S EYE, IN A FINE FRENZY ROLLING,DOTH GLANCE FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH, FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN;AND AS IMAGINATION BODIES FORTHTHE FORMS OF THINGS UNKNOWN, THE POET’S PENTURNS THEM TO SHAPES, AND GIVES TO AIRY NOTHINGA LOCAL HABITATION AND A NAME. SHAKESPEARE’S LANGUAGE OF METAMORPHOSIS DREW INSPIRATION FROM GREEK MYTHS ABOUTGODS AND HUMANS MORPHING INTO ANIMALS AND PLANTS, OF HEROES SNEAKING INTO THEUNDERWORLD AND THE REALM OF THE GODS FOR VARIOUS POETIC OR SHAMANIC PURPOSES.THROUGH LANGUAGE, THE POET TAKES OVER THE ROLE OF SHAMAN OR MAGE, SHAPING THE“FORMS OF THINGS UNKNOWN,” GIVING TO “AIRY NOTHING / A LOCAL HABITATION AND ANAME.”THE THEME OF AWAKENING WAS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE THEME OF IDENTITY. HISCHARACTERS RETURN TO ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS FROM DREAMS, FROM MAGICAL DRUGS THATWARP THEIR SENSES, FROM DELUSIONS THAT TAKE A NIGHTMARISH HOLD ON THEM. BUTAWAKENING, BREAKING THE ENCHANTMENT, IS A PARADOXICAL MOMENT: IN THE ACT OFBECOMING CONSCIOUS—ROMEO AND JULIET IN THE TOMB, LADY MACBETH STARTLED FROMSLEEPWALKING, BOTTOM WAKING IN THE FOREST—SHAKESPEARE’S PROTAGONISTS DO NOTESCAPE THEIR DELUSIONS. THEY SLIP FROM ONE LEVEL OF TRANCE, ONE FORM OFSELF-FORGETTING, INTO ANOTHER.ACCORDING TO THE CRITIC NORTHROP FRYE, THE SYSTEMATIC REVELATIONS AT THE END OFSHAKESPEARE’S PLAYS RESULT FROM “THE TALISMAN OF RECOGNITION THAT AWAKENS THEMIND TO REALITY.” THE TALISMAN CAN BE A GHOST, A STATUE, THE SUDDEN APPEARANCEOF A LONG-LOST FRIEND, A MEMORY. THE “TALISMAN OF RECOGNITION” RESTORES JUSTICETO THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME NEVER ENTIRELY LOSES ITS AMBIVALENCE. THISAWAKENING LEADS TO A HAPPY OUTCOME IN HIS COMEDIES; IN THE TRAGEDIES IT BRINGSINEVITABLE DOOM.SHAKESPEARE’S PLAYS EXPLORE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN DREAM AND WAKING. EVEN WHENTHEY ARE AWAKE, HIS CHARACTERS OFTEN BEHAVE AS THOUGH MESMERIZED. IT IS EASY TOFORGET THAT, WHILE WE ARE AWAKE, WE ARE CONSTANTLY SUBMERGED IN DIFFERENT LEVELSOF AWARENESS—SEMI-CONSCIOUS STATES IN WHICH WE DAYDREAM, SPACE OUT, OR WATCHADVERTISEMENTS; CONCENTRATE WITHOUT ATTENTION; ARE “DISTRACTED BY DISTRACTION.”THE AWAKENING OF MODERN EMPIRICISM NEGATED THE SHAKESPEAREAN FACULTY OF“MARVELOUS INTUITION,” THE ARCHAIC AWARENESS OF THE “INSUBSTANTIAL PAGEANT”POPULATED BY PECULIARLY ANTHROPOMORPHIC SPIRITS, FAIRIES, DRYADS, NYMPHS, AND SOON. PUCK OR PAN AND THEIR AMBIVALENT FOLLOWERS, WERE DISPLACED, IN THE MODERNERA, BY THE UNAMBIGUOUS SATAN. CUT OFF FROM THE ARCHAIC BELIEF INNATURE-AS-SPIRIT, FROM THE MULTIVALENT SPIRITS OF NATURE, THE MODERN MINDINCREASINGLY FIXATED ON ITS OWN SOLITARY STATUS. NOTHING ELSE, NOT ANIMALS, NOTSPIRITS, NOT EVEN THE “NOBLE SAVAGES” THAT EXPLORERS ENCOUNTERED IN THEIRWANDERINGS, SEEMED TO POSSESS LOGIC OR SENTIENCE BESIDES ITSELF.. . .WHAT WERE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE LOST MAGICAL WORLD THAT SHAKESPEARE CONJURES UP,THEN DISPELS, IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM, THE TEMPEST, AND OTHER PLAYS? INECSTASIES, GINZBURG MAKES A LENGTHY ATTEMPT TO PEEL AWAY THE “GRADUAL,CENTURIES-LONG DIABOLIZATION OF A STRATUM OF BELIEFS THAT HAS ONLY REACHED US INA FRAGMENTARY MANNER, THROUGH TEXTS PRODUCED BY CANONISTS, INQUISITORS ANDJUDGES.” HE FINDS, HIDDEN IN ACCOUNTS OF THE WITCH TRIALS, RECORDS OF THETHOUGHT-SYSTEM THAT THE CHURCH PERSECUTED TO THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. AN AMORALCONSORTING WITH NUMEROUS SPIRITS—GOOD, BAD, AND INDIFFERENT—WAS TWISTED INTO ADIABOLICAL FROLIC WITH SATAN’S MINIONS. WHEN THE ACCUSED, LIKE ANDREW MAN, THREWCHRISTIAN TERMS SUCH AS “DEVILS” INTO THEIR TESTIMONY, IT WAS, ACCORDING TOGINZBURG, A “PROFOUND AND UNCONSCIOUS REACTION, WHICH SPREAD A CHRISTIAN VEILOVER A MORE ANCIENT STRATUM OF BELIEFS.” GINZBURG FOUND EXAMPLES OF THESEARCHAIC BELIEFS ALL ACROSS EUROPE. IT WAS AN ORAL TRADITION, OFTEN A FEMININEONE RATHER THAN ONE PRESERVED IN PATRIARCHAL TEXTS.IN THE LONG TRIP, AN OVERVIEW OF THE USE OF VISIONARY PLANTS FROM PREHISTORY ON,PAUL DEVEREUX FINDS THAT THE “WITCHES” CONDEMNED BY THE CHURCH WERE ACTUALLY“THE PRACTICIONERS OF AN ANCIENT TRADITION—‘NIGHT TRAVELERS.’ IN NORTHERN EUROPETHEY WERE CALLED QVELDRIGA, ‘NIGHT RIDER,’ OR MYRKIADA, ‘RIDER IN THE DARK.’ ”AS PART OF THIS TRADITION, A WOMAN KNOWN TO BE A PROPHETESS, DRESSED IN THERITUAL ATTIRE OF A GODDESS—DEPENDING ON LOCATION THIS COULD BE FREYA, DIANA, ORHELA—“WOULD TRAVEL TO FARMSTEADS AND HAMLETS WITH A GROUP OF GIRLS TO GIVEDIVINATORY TRANCE SESSIONS.” LIKE THE WEIRD SISTERS IN MACBETH, THEY WERE THEINHERITORS OF AN ARCHAIC EUROPEAN SHAMANISM. LIKE SHAMANS AROUND THE WORLD, THESEERESS AND HER FOLLOWERS USED PLANT POTIONS TO ACHIEVE ECSTATIC STATES: “THENIGHT TRAVELER’S FLIGHT INTO THE WILDERNESS WAS, OF COURSE, A TRANCE ‘JOURNEY’INTO THE DEEP REACHES OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND, A ‘SPIRIT FLIGHT’ CAUSED,USUALLY, BY HALLUCINOGENS IN THE FLYING OINTMENTS.”ACROSS THE PREMODERN WORLD, COUNTRY PEOPLE MAINTAINED AN ACTIVE RELATIONSHIPWITH THE SPIRITS AND ELEMENTAL BEINGS HIDDEN IN NATURE. FROM SECRET KINGDOMSJUST BEYOND THE MARGINS OF THE PERCEPTIBLE, THE “GOOD NEIGHBORS” WERE KNOWN TOCAST THEIR INFLUENCE OVER HUMAN RELATIONS, THE FATE OF KINGDOMS, THE WEATHER,AND ALL NATURAL EVENTS. IN MANY OF HIS PLAYS, SHAKESPEARE DREW UPON THISVESTIGIAL AWARENESS OF MAGICAL REALMS.WITH THE ARRIVAL OF MODERNITY, THIS ARENA OF FOLK KNOWLEDGE, ALONG WITH ALLMODES OF NONORDINARY PERCEPTION, WAS BANISHED FROM THE MAINSTREAM OF WESTERNLITERARY AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE, EXILED TO THE REALMS OF FAIRY TALE ANDMOTH-EATEN MYTH. MODERN CULTURE, DEVOTED TO MERCANTILISM, INDUSTRIALISM, ANDSCIENTIFIC PROGRESS, ENFORCED A SHARP DISTINCTION BETWEEN SLEEP AND WAKING,IDLENESS AND PRODUCTIVITY, CHILDHOOD AND ADULTHOOD, HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND THENONSENTIENT WORLD OF NATURE. THE EXISTENCE OF NUMEROUS ORDERS OF CONSCIOUSBEINGS—BEINGS THAT COULD SHOW THEMSELVES UPON OCCASION, BUT MOST OFTEN APPEAREDIN CERTAIN ECSTATIC STATES OR IN DREAMS—WAS ADAMANTLY DENIED BY BOTH CHURCH ANDSTATE.AFTER ROOTING OUT ITS WITCHES AND SHAMANS AND DESTROYING ITS VISIONARYTRADITIONS, THE MODERN WORLD RELIED ON ARTISTS AND POETS TO CREATE PALLIDSIMULATIONS OF WHAT HAD BEEN LOST. FROM SHAKESPEARE TO SPIELBERG, WILLIAM BLAKETO JOSEPH BEUYS, THESE ARTISTIC EVOCATIONS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE TRANSFORMATIVEPOWER OF AN ACTUAL ENCOUNTER WITH A SUPERNATURAL “OTHER,” OR THE PERSONALEXPERIENCE OF AN ALTERED STATE. WHAT HAD BEEN BANISHED FROM MEMORY ANDSUPPRESSED FROM AWARENESS COULD NOW BE ENJOYED AS CATHARTIC SPECTACLE, ORRIDICULED FROM THE PATRONIZING PERSPECTIVE OF THE “RATIONAL” CRITICAL MIND. INTHE MODERN WORLD, THE ARTIST TOOK OVER THE ROLE OF THE SHAMAN. TO ENFORCE ONEPARTICULAR MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, MODERN HUMANITY FORFEITED ALL DIRECT CONTACTWITH ITS NONHUMAN SHADOWS."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11SHAMANISM ANDTHE WORLD TREE[images/00006.jpg] SHAMANISM IS A TECHNOLOGY FOR EXPLORING NONORDINARY STATESOF CONSCIOUSNESS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH SPECIFIC PURPOSES: HEALING, DIVINATION,AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE SPIRIT REALM. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SHAMANISM WEREDEFINED BY THE RELIGIOUS HISTORIAN MIRCEA ELIADE: “SPECIAL RELATIONS WITH‘SPIRITS,’ ECSTATIC CAPACITIES PERMITTING OF MAGICAL FLIGHT, ASCENT TO THE SKY,DESCENT TO THE UNDERWORLD, MASTERY OVER FIRE, ETC.” SHAMANISM CAN ALSO INVOLVEMAGICAL TRANSFORMATION OF HUMANS INTO ANIMALS, PROPHETIC DREAMS, AND INTERACTIONWITH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD.THE BELIEF SYSTEM OF SHAMANISM POSITS, BESIDES THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE AND TIMETHAT ARE TANGIBLE TO US, OTHER DIMENSIONS, ACCESSIBLE THROUGH HEIGHTENEDCONSCIOUSNESS OR TRANCE. THESE OTHER DIMENSIONS, WHICH PASS THROUGH EVERY HUMANBEING, ARE OFTEN REPRESENTED BY THE AXIS MUNDI, OR WORLD TREE, WITH ROOTSREACHING DOWN INTO THE LOWER DOMAINS OF GHOSTS AND SPIRITS, AND BRANCHESSTRETCHING UP TOWARD THE GODS. “THE UNDERWORLD, THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, AND THE‘GATE’ OF THE SKY ARE SITUATED ON THE SAME AXIS, AND IN PAST TIMES IT WAS BYTHIS AXIS THAT PASSAGE FROM ONE COSMIC REGION TO ANOTHER WAS EFFECTED,” ELIADENOTES.THE PHENOMENON OF SHAMANISM IS UNFATHOMABLY OLD AND AMAZINGLY WIDESPREAD. WHILESOME HISTORIANS BELIEVE THE NOMADS OF THE SIBERIAN STEPPES WERE THE ORIGINALSHAMANIC CULTURE—AND THEIR NOMADISM TOOK THEM ACROSS THE BERING STRAITS INTO THEAMERICAS AS WELL AS THROUGH ASIA—THAT DOES NOT HELP TO EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OFFULLY DEVELOPED SHAMANIC PRACTICES AMONG AFRICAN PYGMIES AND AUSTRALIANABORIGINALS. SHAMANISM IS A FULLY DEVELOPED ENTERPRISE AMONG AUSTRALIAN TRIBESWHO SEPARATED FROM OTHER HUMAN POPULATIONS AS MUCH AS FORTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO.OUTSIDE OF THE MODERN WESTERN CULTURES, SHAMANISM SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING CLOSE TOA UNIVERSAL HUMAN PHENOMENON. ITS OPPOSITE IN ARCHAIC TRADITIONS ARE THE CULTSOF “SPIRIT POSSESSION” STILL FOUND ACROSS AFRICA. IN THESE TRADITIONS, A GOD ORSPIRIT COMES DOWN AND OCCUPIES THE BODY OF AN ENTRANCED PARTICIPANT. IN SHAMANICTRANCES, THE SHAMAN HOLDS ON TO HIS PSYCHIC INTEGRITY. HE GOES OUT INTO THESPIRIT REALMS AND RETURNS TO HIS HAMMOCK OR HUT IN FULL CONSCIOUSNESS.ELIADE ILLUMINATES CROSS-CULTURAL SIMILARITIES IN SHAMANIC BELIEF SYSTEMS ACROSSTHE WORLD. FROM AUSTRALIA TO BRAZIL TO SIBERIA, HE DOCUMENTS MYTHS OF ANCIENT“COSMIC SERPENTS” THAT BROUGHT LIFE TO EARTH, OF AN ORIGINAL BATTLE IN WHICH THEMEN OVERTHREW A PRIMORDIAL AND FEMININE CHAOS TO BEGIN TIME, OF THE HEALINGPOWER OF ROCK CRYSTALS AND THE MAGIC BREATH OF THE SHAMAN.SHAMANIC INITIATION OFTEN TAKES THE FORM OF A SICKNESS—THE CURE IS THE DISCOVERYOF THE VOCATION. ELIADE WROTE ABOUT A FAMOUS YAKUT SHAMAN WHO HAD BEEN ILL AS AYOUNG MAN. IF HE DID NOT SHAMANIZE, HIS ILLNESS WOULD RETURN. SHAMANS OFTENBECOME SICK WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG. DURING THEIR ILLNESS, THEY MAY SEE VISIONS OFSPIRITS OR MEET THE GHOSTS OF THEIR ANCESTORS. SHAMANISM CAN ALSO BE INHERITEDTHROUGH A FAMILY LINE. A DRAMATIC WAY TO BECOME A SHAMAN IS TO BE STRUCK BYLIGHTNING AND SURVIVE. “THE GREEKS BELIEVED A PERSON STRUCK BY LIGHTNING WAS INPOSSESSION OF MAGICAL POWERS, AND IN TRIBAL CULTURES THROUGHOUT THE WORLDLIGHTNING SHAMANS ARE VENERATED AND FEARED AS MIGHTY SHAMANS,” NOTES HOLGERKALWEIT, A GERMAN SCHOLAR WHO RECOUNTS SEVERAL CASE HISTORIES OF LIGHTNINGSHAMANS WHO MANIFESTED SUPERHUMAN POWERS GIVEN TO THEM BY THE “THUNDER BEINGS.”TRADITIONALLY, THE EVOLUTION FROM ORDINARY HUMAN STATE TO SHAMAN IS MARKED BY ASERIES OF VISIONS AND DREAMS OF THE NOVICE BEING KILLED, DISMEMBERED, EATEN,REGURGITATED, AND PUT BACK TOGETHER BY THE SPIRITS. HIS OR HER BONES AREREPLACED WITH QUARTZ CRYSTALS, PRECIOUS METALS, OR SIMILAR MAGICAL SUBSTANCES.FOR INSTANCE, IN BORNEO, ACCORDING TO ELIADE, THE SPIRITS OF PAST SHAMANS COMETO THE INITIATE, THEY “CUT HIS HEAD OPEN, TAKE OUT HIS BRAINS, WASH AND RESTORETHEM . . . INSERT GOLD DUST INTO HIS EYES TO GIVE HIM KEENNESS AND STRENGTH OFSIGHT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SEE THE SOUL WHEREVER IT MAY HAVE WANDERED; THEY PLANTBARBED HOOKS ON THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS TO ENABLE HIM TO SEIZE THE SOUL AND HOLDIT FAST; AND LASTLY THEY PIERCE HIS HEART WITH AN ARROW TO MAKE HIMTENDER-HEARTED, AND FULL OF SYMPATHY WITH THE SICK AND SUFFERING.” IN MOSTCULTURES THE MAJORITY OF SHAMANS ARE MEN; HOWEVER, WHEN WOMEN BECOME SHAMANSTHEY ARE OFTEN ESPECIALLY POWERFUL. IN SOME TRIBES, SHAMANS HAVE AN AMBIGUOUSGENDER-IDENTITY, DRESSING LIKE WOMEN, OR REMAINING CELIBATE.ELIADE SUMS UP THE VAST ANTHROPOLOGICAL LITERATURE ON SHAMANIC INITIATIONS AS“THE DEATH AND MYSTICAL RESURRECTION OF THE CANDIDATE BY MEANS OF A DESCENT TOTHE UNDERWORLD AND AN ASCENT TO THE SKY.” THE CANDIDATE, WHILE HE IS UNDERGOINGSHAMANIC INITIATION, RECEIVES A “MASSIVE INFLUX” OF THE SACRED. THAT TEMPORARYUNLEASHING OF SUPERNATURAL FORCES THAT THE INITIATE MUST LEARN TO CONTROL CAN BEDANGEROUS TO THOSE CLOSE TO HIM. ACCORDING TO THE HISTORIAN WILLIAM IRWINTHOMPSON, THE SHAMAN IS A “TRANSFORMER WHO TAKES IN POWERFUL ENERGIES, STEPSTHEM DOWN, AND TURNS THEM INTO A WEAKER ALTERNATING CURRENT THAT CAN BE USED INALL THE HOMES OF THE ORDINARY FOLK.” BY MEDIATING BETWEEN THE SUPRAHUMAN ANDELEMENTAL REALMS, THE SHAMAN ALLOWS CIVILIZATION TO TAKE PLACE.THE TRADITIONAL SHAMAN IS HEALER, GARDENER, STORYTELLER, FORECASTER, ANDINITIATOR INTO THE SPIRIT REALMS. ONE OF HIS TASKS IS TO BRING THE SOULS OF THEDEAD TO THEIR PLACE IN THE UNDERWORLD. THE SHAMAN’S WISDOM, HIS RELATIONSHIPWITH THE SPIRIT REALM, HIS CAPACITY FOR ECSTATIC EXPERIENCE, MAKES HIM “THEGREAT SPECIALIST IN THE HUMAN SOUL; HE ALONE ‘SEES’ IT, FOR HE KNOWS ITS ‘FORM’AND ITS DESTINY,” ELIADE WRITES.SHAMANIC OPERATIONS UTILIZE A SUBSTANCE THAT IS PRODUCED WITHIN THE SHAMAN’SBODY AND MATERIALIZED IN VARIOUS WAYS, AS A FLUID, ROCK CRYSTAL, OR MAGICALDART. ACCORDING TO THE ANTHROPOLOGIST ALFRED METRAUX: “THE SHAMAN’S POWER ALSOHAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY SOME AUTHORITIES AS A SUBSTANCE WHICH THE MAGICIAN CARRIEDIN HIS BODY. THE GESTURES OF SHAMANS DURING THEIR MAGIC OPERATIONS SUGGESTEDTHAT THEY WERE HANDLING SOME INVISIBLE STUFF WHICH THEY REMOVED FROM THEPATIENT’S BODY OR TRANSMITTED TO PERSONS OR EVEN THINGS TO ENHANCE THEIREXCELLENCE. THE APAPOCUVA-GUARANI SHAMANS, FOR INSTANCE, WERE GIVEN A SUBSTANCEBY THE SPIRITS WHICH, IN TURN, THEY COULD COMMUNICATE TO OTHER PEOPLE TOINCREASE THEIR VITALITY.”SOME WRITERS, SUCH AS TERENCE MCKENNA, HAVE EQUATED THIS SUBSTANCE WITH THEPRIMAL SUBSTANCE, BETWEEN MATTER AND CONSCIOUSNESS, SOUGHT BY THE ALCHEMISTS. INTHE HERMETIC TRADITION, A BOOK ON THE EUROPEAN TRADITION OF ALCHEMY, JULIUSEVOLA WRITES, “THE HERMETICIST PERFORMS CERTAIN OPERATIONS BY WHICH HEACTUALIZES AND BRINGS TO PERFECTION A SYMBOLIC ‘MATTER.’ ” IN THE SYMBOLICLANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY, THIS PRECIOUS STUFF IS THE “GOLD” THAT THE ALCHEMISTS SEEKTO FABRICATE. IT IS A BYPRODUCT OF THE INTERIOR PROCESS OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION.THE LOCAL TECHNOLOGIES OF ARCHAIC SHAMANISM ARE SOPHISTICATED, EFFECTIVE, ANDHIGHLY PRAGMATIC. WHAT LATER BECAME THE CLICHÉ WITCH’S BROOMSTICK WAS ORIGINALLYA TOOL FOR SPREADING LOTIONS MADE OF EXTRACTS FROM BELLADONNA, HENBANE, ANDHEMLOCK, DANGEROUS PLANTS CONTAINING POISONOUS AND INTOXICATING TROPANEALKALOIDS. ACCORDING TO ANTHROPOLOGIST MICHAEL HARNER, THE BROOMSTICK SERVED AS“AN APPLICATOR FOR THE ATROPINE-CONTAINING PLANT TO THE SENSITIVE VAGINALMEMBRANES AS WELL AS PROVIDING THE SUGGESTION OF RIDING ON A STEED, A TYPICALILLUSION OF THE WITCHES’ RIDE TO THE SABBATH.”GINZBURG SUSPECTS THAT ANDREW MAN’S NIGHT OF FROLIC WITH THE “GOOD NEIGHBORS”WAS PRIMED BY AN INGESTION OF INTOXICATING PLANTS. ACCORDING TO GINZBURG, THISTECHNIQUE WAS KNOWN TO SOME SCHOLARS OF THE TIME: “IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURYSCIENTISTS LIKE CARDANO OR DELLA PORTA FORMULATED A DIFFERENT OPINION: ANIMALMETAMORPHOSES, FLIGHTS, APPARITIONS OF THE DEVIL WERE THE EFFECTS OFMALNUTRITION OR THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN VEGETABLECONCOCTIONS OR OINTMENTS.” ALTHOUGH GINZBURG DOESN’T TRY SUCH ANATROPINE-CONTAINING LOTION OR POTION HIMSELF, HE CONFIDENTLY DECLARES THAT NOPOTION OR PLANT OR SHAMANIC TECHNIQUE COULD BE RESPONSIBLE, IN ITSELF, FOR SUCHA VISIONARY NARRATIVE. “AGAINST ALL BIOLOGICAL DETERMINISM ONE MUST EMPHASIZETHAT THE KEY TO THIS CODIFIED REPETITION CAN ONLY BE CULTURAL.”GINZBURG DOES NOT DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANS BY “CULTURAL” HERE, BUT HISDECLARATION THAT NO POTION, BY ITSELF, COULD HAVE INDUCED ANDREW MAN’S VISIONSBELONGS TO A TRADITION OF SCHOLARLY CONDESCENSION TOWARD THE SHAMANIC USE OFPSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS. THIS TRADITION INCLUDES ELIADE’S INSISTENCE, IN HIS CLASSICWORK SHAMANISM: ARCHAIC TECHNIQUES OF ECSTASY (1951) THAT INGESTION OF VISIONARYFLORA, WHETHER SMOKED, EATEN, DRUNK, OR SNUFFED (A.K.A. “DRUGS”), REPRESENTS ADECADENT PHASE OF SHAMANISM: NARCOTICS ARE ONLY A VULGAR SUBSTITUTE FOR “PURE” TRANCE. WE HAVE ALREADY HADOCCASION TO NOTE THIS FACT AMONG SEVERAL SIBERIAN PEOPLES; THE USE OFINTOXICANTS (ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, ETC.) IS A RECENT INNOVATION AND POINTS TO ADECADENCE IN SHAMANIC TECHNIQUE. NARCOTIC INTOXICATION IS CALLED ON TO PROVIDEAN IMITATION OF A STATE THAT THE SHAMAN IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF ATTAININGOTHERWISE. ELIADE’S STATEMENT IS NOT JUST MISLEADING, IT SEEMS TO BE A REVERSAL OF THEACTUAL FACTS.THE USE OF PLANTS TO INDUCE TRANCE STATES IS AN ANCIENT AND WORLDWIDE PRACTICE.IT IS NOT THE ONLY WAY OF SEEKING VISIONS—DANCING, FASTING, MEDITATION,SELF-MORTIFICATION ARE OTHER WAYS—BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE SUREFIRE METHOD.DISCOVERIES IN ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY CLARIFIED THIS AFTER ELIADEPUBLISHED HIS BOOK—A FEW YEARS LATER, GORDON AND VALENTINA WASSON FOUND THEMUSHROOM CULT AMONG THE MAZATECS. BUT ELIADE’S STATEMENT REVEALED HIS PREJUDICEAGAINST “NARCOTIC INTOXICATION,” AS WELL AS PURITANICAL RESISTANCE TO ANY FASTTRACK FOR REACHING MYSTICAL STATES.GINZBURG’S ECSTASIES, WRITTEN FORTY YEARS AFTER ELIADE’S TOME, IS ACTUALLY ALONG-WINDED ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THOSE PREJUDICES, TO BRING THE SUPPRESSED FACTSINTO HISTORICAL DISCOURSE. “THE UNFATHOMABLE EXPERIENCE THAT HUMANITY HASSYMBOLICALLY EXPRESSED FOR MILLENNIA THROUGH MYTHS, FABLES, RITUALS ANDECSTASIES, REMAINS ONE OF THE HIDDEN CENTRES OF OUR CULTURE, OF THE WAY WE EXISTIN THE WORLD.” GINZBURG ARGUES THAT THE “UNFATHOMABLE EXPERIENCE,” THEREVELATION OF “THE FORMS OF THINGS UNSEEN,” IS OFTEN A RESULT OF TRANCE STATESPRODUCED THROUGH PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS.HE INVESTIGATES ANTIQUATED TERMS SUCH AS “DRUNKEN RYE” OR “MAD WHEAT” FORSTRAINS OF RYE INFECTED BY CLAVICEPS PURPUREA, A MUSHROOM, ALSO KNOWN AS ERGOTFUNGUS. THE TERMS SUGGEST A LOST AWARENESS OF ERGOT’S USE AS A SHAMANICINTOXICANT. ERGOT WAS USED BY MIDWIVES TO INDUCE LABOR, AND IT IS ALSO THESOURCE FROM WHICH LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE, LSD, WAS SYNTHESIZED. HE ALSOSTUDIES MYTHIC ALLUSIONS TO AMANITA MUSCARIA, THE RED-CAPPED MUSHROOM USED BYSIBERIAN SHAMANS, AND FINDS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WIDESPREAD MYTHS INVOLVINGLAMENESS, FROM CINDERELLA’S SLIPPER TO OEDIPUS’S LIMP, AND THESE MUSHROOMS,OFTEN IDENTIFIED AS “THE SINGLE-FOOTED.” IN HIS CONCLUSION, GINZBURG REALIZES HEHAS BEEN EXAMINING NOT A SINGLE NARRATIVE “BUT THE MATRIX OF ALL POSSIBLENARRATIVES.” HE EQUATES THE HISTORIAN’S TASK WITH THE SHAMAN’S FLIGHTS: “THEATTEMPT TO ATTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST IS ALSO A JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD OF THEDEAD.”IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE INFLUENCE THAT SHAMANS HAD OVER THEIR TRIBE WASINSCRIBED IN THE LAND ITSELF. THE EARTHWORKS AND EFFIGY MOUNDS LEFT BY NORTHAMERICAN TRIBES ACROSS THE CONTINENT, THE VAST NAZCA LINES IN PERU, THE LEYLINES AND STONE CIRCLES OF EUROPE, AND THE SIMILAR STRAIGHT ROADS THAT RUNACROSS VAST STRETCHES OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA ARE RESIDUES OF SHAMANICALIGNMENT WITH THE EARTH’S SUBTLE ENERGIES. MANY OF THEM SHOW ANIMAL, BIRD, ANDHUMAN-BIRD FORMS THAT POWERFUL SHAMANS WOULD TAKE IN THEIR TRANCE STATES. THESTRAIGHT ROADS MAY REPRESENT PATHS THAT SHAMANS USED TO FLY INTO THE “OTHERWORLDS.” THROUGHOUT EUROPE, THE CHURCH CAPITALIZED ON THIS ARCHAIC TOPOGRAPHY;MANY CATHEDRALS AND CHAPELS WERE PLACED ALONG LONG-FORGOTTEN LEY LINES. PAULDEVEREUX WRITES THAT THE STRAIGHT-LINE ROADS “SYMBOLIZE SPIRIT TRAVEL,JOURNEYING INTO THE OTHERWORLD OF SPIRITS, OF THE ANCESTORS, WHICH . . . CAN BESEEN IN SHAMANIC TERMS AS SIMPLY ANOTHER LEVEL OR DIMENSION OF THE PHYSICALLANDSCAPE.”BRUCE CHATWIN’S THE SONG LINES DESCRIBES THE SHAMANIC GEOGRAPHY OF AUSTRALIANABORIGINALS. ALL TRIBAL MEMBERS HAVE THEIR OWN CLAN SONG AND PERSONAL SONG,WHICH ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO LOCAL GEOGRAPHY—A ROCK, A HILLSIDE, A POND MIGHTHAVE ITS OWN COSMOLOGICAL RESONANCE EMBODIED IN A STORY COMMITTED TO MEMORY FORUNCOUNTABLE GENERATIONS. TRADITIONALLY, THESE SONGS EVEN ACTED AS A FORM OFCURRENCY. IN ORDER TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER CLAN’S AREA, A TRIBESMAN HAD TOBARTER FOR THE APPROPRIATE HYMN.THE ABORIGINALS BELIEVE THAT THEIR MYTHOLOGICAL ANCESTORS SANG THE LAND AND ALLOF ITS CREATURES INTO EXISTENCE. A TRIBESMAN’S RELIGIOUS LIFE “HAD A SINGLE AIM:TO KEEP THE LAND THE WAY IT WAS AND SHOULD BE,” CHATWIN WRITES. “THE MAN WHOWENT ‘WALKABOUT’ WAS MAKING A RITUAL JOURNEY. HE TROD IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THEANCESTOR. HE SANG THE ANCESTOR’S STANZAS WITHOUT CHANGING A WORD OR NOTE—AND SORE-CREATED THE CREATION.” LIKE A VAST LOOM, THE ENTIRE AUSTRALIAN CONTINENT ISCRISSCROSSED BY SONGS THAT ARE, AT THE SAME TIME, INTERWOVEN MYTHS OF CREATION,THE HARMONIC RESIDUE OF GEOLOGICAL EVENTS, AND ELEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S SURFACE.FOR THE ABORIGINALS, THE NATURAL AND SUPERNATURAL ASPECTS OF REALITY AREINSEPARABLE. HUMANITY HAS A SACRED TASK IN THE WORLD, AND EXISTS TO PERFORM ASACRED FUNCTION. THIS TASK IS CONNECTED TO THE ABILITY, OR GIFT, THAT SEPARATESTHEM FROM ALL OTHER LIVING THINGS: THE GIFT OF LANGUAGE.IN “THE MUSHROOMS OF LANGUAGE,” AN ESSAY ON MAZATEC SHAMANISM, THE WRITER HENRYMUNN NOTES THAT LINGUISTIC INSPIRATION IS THE MOST PROFOUND EFFECT OF EATING THEMUSHROOMS. “THOSE WHO EAT THEM ARE MEN OF LANGUAGE, ILLUMINATED WITH THE SPIRIT,WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE ONES WHO SPEAK, THOSE WHO SAY.” THE ABILITY TO HEAL ISDIRECTLY RELATED TO ECSTATIC AND INSPIRED SPEECH, “A PRIMORDIAL ACTIVITY OFSIGNIFICATION,” IMPARTED BY THE MUSHROOMS. “THE INDIAN SHAMANS ARE NOTCONTEMPLATIVE; THEY ARE WORKERS WHO ACTIVELY EXPRESS THEMSELVES BY SPEAKING,CREATORS ENGAGED IN AN ENDEAVOUR OF ONTOLOGICAL, EXISTENTIAL DISCLOSURE.” THESHAMANS ARE ENUNCIATORS OF REVELATORY REALITY.WALTER BENJAMIN’S THOUGHTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE ECHO THE INDIGENOUSVIEWPOINT: “THE EXISTENCE OF LANGUAGE . . . IS NOT ONLY COEXISTENT WITH ALL THEAREAS OF HUMAN MENTAL EXPRESSION IN WHICH LANGUAGE IS ALWAYS IN ONE SENSE ORANOTHER INHERENT, BUT WITH ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING,” HE WROTE. “THERE IS NO EVENTOR THING IN EITHER ANIMATE OR INANIMATE NATURE THAT DOES NOT IN SOME WAY PARTAKEOF LANGUAGE, FOR IT IS IN THE NATURE OF ALL TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MENTALMEANINGS.” SIGNIFYING IS, IN ITSELF, A SACRED ACT—“IN NAMING THE MENTAL BEING OFMAN COMMUNICATES ITSELF TO GOD.”IN BENJAMIN’S CONCEPTION, THE EXISTENCE OF LANGUAGE, THE POSSIBILITY OFEXPRESSION, IS IMMANENT IN EVERY OBJECT THAT EXISTS. FOR THE ABORIGINAL, THEANCIENT ACT OF NAMING, OF STORYTELLING, LITERALLY INVENTS, INITIATES, THE WORLD.THE SHAMAN’S USE OF LANGUAGE, HIS CHANTS AND SONGS, IS FORMATIVE, PRIMORDIALLYCREATIVE, AS WELL AS PROTECTIVE AND HEALING. AS TERENCE MCKENNA PUT IT, FOR THESHAMAN, “THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF LANGUAGE.” MYTH WEAVES THE WORLD INTO BEING.IN ALL SHAMANIC CULTURES, LANDSCAPES ARE PSYCHIC AND SPIRITUAL EXTENSIONS ASWELL AS PHYSICAL ONES. TRADITIONAL SHAMANISM HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEEPLY ROOTED INPLACE. A SHUAR SHAMAN FROM THE ECUADOREAN AMAZON TOLD ME THAT HE BELIEVED HISPOWERS OF HEALING CAME TO HIM FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHERE HE LIVED. THE MOUNTAINSCONVEYED SOME OF THEIR ELEMENTAL ENERGY AND MAGNETIC FORCE TO HIM, AND THROUGHTHE MEDIUM OF THE AYAHUASCA VINE AS WELL AS TOBACCO, ONE OF THE MOST SACREDSHAMANIC PLANTS ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA, HE COULD CHANNEL THIS FORCE TO HISPATIENTS.IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THOSE OF US, LIKE MYSELF, WHO GREW UP ROOTLESS IN MODERNCITIES OR SUBURBS TO FULLY COMPREHEND THIS SENSE OF THE SACREDNESS, THESUPERNATURAL POWER, OF A LAND THAT HAS BEEN INHABITED BY THE SAME PEOPLE OVERINNUMERABLE GENERATIONS. WHEN WE READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE UWA INDIANS—A TRIBEIN COLOMBIA THREATENING TO COMMIT MASS SUICIDE IF THE OIL COMPANIES DRILL ONTHEIR LAND—WE MAY FEEL PROFOUND SYMPATHY. BUT WE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE HAVING ANIDENTIFICATION WITH A PART OF THE EARTH, THE SHAPE OF THE LAND AND THEPARTICULAR PLANTS THAT GROW THERE, WHICH IS SO STRONG THAT WE WOULD RATHER DIETHAN ABANDON IT.THE MODERN PERSON DRAWN TO THE SHAMANIC ARCHETYPE—THE VISION OF SACRED EARTH,REVELATORY WORD, AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL COSMOS—FINDS HIMSELF HORRIFIED BYCONTEMPORARY SOCIETY AND THE ACCELERATING PROCESSES OF GLOBAL DESTRUCTION IT HASUNLEASHED. YET HE IS CUT OFF FROM THE ARCHAIC TRADITIONS HE MIGHT LIKE TOEMBRACE. OUR TRADITION SEEMS TO DENY US ACCESS TO SPIRITUAL VISION, AND WE HAVELOST THE INDIANS’ INNATE RELATION WITH THE NATURAL WORLD AS SACRED BEING.AND YET, IF SHAMANISM IS A UNIVERSAL HUMAN PHENOMENON, WE POSSESS THE INNATEABILITY TO REGAIN EVERYTHING WE HAVE LOST."},{"pageContent":"[images/00008.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12A CYBERNETICPULSE ENGINE[images/00006.jpg] THE DRIVE TO BLACK ROCK CITY FROM SAN FRANCISCO LEADSTHROUGH NEVADA FLATLANDS, PAST THE JITTERING NEON SADNESS OF RENO. MY FRIENDADAM AND I MADE THE OBLIGATORY STOP AT THE LAST TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SUPERMARKET ANDCASINO, DROPPING A QUARTER IN THE FINAL SLOT MACHINE, A TINY OFFERING TO THEGRAY SHROUD OF FLAT DESERT AHEAD. AT THE SHOPPING MART, WE GREETED THE OTHEROBVIOUS BURNERS, TATTOOED OR FACE-PIERCED OR WITH HAIR DYED IN PATTERNS, THEIRTRUCKS OVERFLOWING WITH PVC PIPE AND JUNKYARD SCRAPS, TAXIDERMIED ANIMALS,CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, BATTERED COUCHES, MASSAGE TABLES, COSTUMES, AND TURNTABLES. WEMET TWO FEATHER, A MUSCULAR PONYTAILED INDIAN RIDING A GIANT, SHINING CHERRY-REDCHOPPER. WITH HIS BLOND TRAVEL-WEARY AUSTRIAN GIRLFRIEND WEDGED BEHIND HIM, HEWAS LIKE A PURE EMANATION OF AMERICA. WHILE HIS DUST-COVERED YET STILL SULTRYPARTNER WATCHED, TWO FEATHER TIED PLASTIC CONTAINERS OF POLAND SPRING WATER TOTHE CHOPPER. HE GAVE OUT HIS WEBSITE ADDRESS AND RAISED A FIST BEFOREDUSTCLOUDING INTO THE DISTANCE.“SEX!” HE CALLED OUT AS FAREWELL.FROM THE LAST SHOPPING MALL, THE DRIVE THROUGH THE NIGHT TURNS INCREASINGLYSURREAL. THERE IS NOTHING TO SEE BUT SHADOWY SAGEBRUSH AND THE OCCASIONALSUICIDAL JACKRABBIT WITH CARTOON EARS AND FLASHING EYES SUDDENLY LEAPING INTOTHE HEADLIGHTS. CONFRONTING SUCH OBLIVION, WHAT LIVING THING WOULDN’T BE TEMPTEDTO SELF-DESTRUCT? EVERY YEAR, PERHAPS IMITATING THE JACKRABBITS, A FEW BURNERSCRASH THEIR VEHICLES ON THIS LAST LAP OF THE HIPSTER PILGRIMAGE.THE BLACK ROCK DESERT IS UNIQUE AMONG WASTELANDS. A PREHISTORIC LAKE BED, IT ISTHE PLANETARY EQUIVALENT OF ABSOLUTE ZERO. THIS FLAT PLANE, RINGED BY MOUNTAINS,IS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF PLANT OR BIRD OR INSECT LIFE. NOTHING MOVES EXCEPT THEEVER-CHANGING CECIL B. DEMILLE SPECTACLE OF CLOUD FORMATIONS AND, AT NIGHT, THEMOON AND ITS UNFURLED BANNER OF STARS SHIMMERING OVER THE WIDE-ANGLE SKY. THECLAYLIKE SURFACE OF THE PLAYA IS LUNAR AND UNREAL, TRACED WITH CRAGGY LINES ANDZIGZAG PATTERNS. IN DRY WEATHER THE PLAYA BOUNCES UNDERFOOT LIKE ASTROTURF. THELOCAL INDIANS MADE BLACK ROCK THE CENTER OF THEIR CREATION MYTH. THESE DAYS, ITSEND-OF-THE-WORLD AMBIENCE IS OFTEN THE BACKDROP FOR SUV ADS.“NOTHING LIVES OUT HERE UNLESS YOU FORCE IT TO,” SAID A BURNING MAN VETERAN. THESPONGY SALINITY OF THAT ALIEN, INHUMAN EARTH CHANGES THE METABOLISM, REWIRES ITIN SOME WAY. SLEEP BECOMES ENTIRELY OPTIONAL. THE DESERT ALSO DOES INTERESTINGTHINGS TO YOUR HAIR; “PLAYA HAIR” IS THE CONDITION WHERE THE TOP OF YOURUNWASHED HEAD TURNS INTO A GRAY, SPORELIKE GROWTH.I CAMPED WITH ADAM, AN EDITOR AT WIRED MAGAZINE IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND HISFRIENDS—ARCHITECTS, DESIGNERS, BAY AREA RAVERS. BACK IN SF, ADAM HAD FILLED MEIN ON THE EROTIC TANGLES AND PSYCHODYNAMIC SUBTEXTS AMONG THE GROUP—THE CENTRALFIGURES WERE A MARRIED COUPLE IN THEIR LATE TWENTIES; EACH WITH ANOTHER LOVERCONVENIENTLY LOCATED IN A NEARBY TENT. LIKABLE, TAUT, PHOTOGENIC, MY CAMPMATESEMANATED AN E-LATED VIBE OF HYPED-UP COMMUNION.WE ARRIVED LATE AT NIGHT. THE NEXT MORNING WE UNPACKED THE RENTED U-HAUL ANDSPENT MANY HOURS TURNING A GREEN PARACHUTE INTO A MUSHROOM-SHAPED SHADESTRUCTURE SUPPORTED BY CABLES THAT JUST BARELY SURVIVED THE WIND’S WEEKLONGASSAULT. THE CITY—AT ITS ZENITH REACHING A POPULATION OF 25,000, MAKING IT THETHIRD LARGEST URBAN CENTER IN NEVADA—WAS QUICKLY RAISING ITSELF OUT OF THE EARTHAROUND US. NEW DOMES AND TENTS, NEW TURRETS AND TOWERS APPEARED EACH HOUR.ACROSS THE ROAD FROM US WAS THE EROWID DOME. EROWID IS ONE OF THE MOSTCOMPREHENSIVE WEBSITES ON PSYCHEDELICS. IT FEATURES TRIP REPORTS, RESOURCELISTS, PHOTOGRAPHS OF PLANTS, DIAGRAMS OF PSYCHOACTIVE MOLECULES, LEGALPRECEDENTS, AND MUCH MORE. I BORROWED A HAMMER AS A PRETEXT TO MEET EARTH ANDFIRE EROWID, THE HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM WHO RUN THE SITE. I ENDED UP SWEATING OUTTHE 110-DEGREE AFTERNOON HEAT SITTING IN THE EROWID CENTER AS PEOPLE CAMETHROUGH, TO PERUSE THE BOOKS AND ARTICLES ASSEMBLED IN THE EROWID LIBRARY, ANDSHARE STORIES OF THEIR OWN ADVENTURES.THE TRIP REPORTS POSTED ON EROWID AND OTHER WEBSITES MAKE FOR FASCINATINGREADING. HERE, YOU FIND NUMEROUS REPORTS OF ENCOUNTERS WITH “PREYING MANTISENTITIES” AND “MACHINE ELVES” ON DMT, MYSTICAL MELTDOWNS ON LSD AND COUGH SYRUP,AND BRAVE EXPLORATIONS OF NEW CHEMICAL AND BOTANICAL DISCOVERIES. PROBABLYTHROUGH ALL OF HISTORY BUT CERTAINLY FROM THE MIDDLE AGES ON, DRUGEXPERIMENTATION HAS BEEN A SECRET SUBCULTURE, ESSENTIALLY ORAL AND UNDERGROUND,A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE EVOLVING THROUGH FABLE, EXAGGERATION, AND RUMOR. THEINTERNET, THE SYNAPTICALLY SELF-ASSEMBLING GLOBAL BRAIN OF HUMANITY, HASPROVIDED SYSTEM AND STRUCTURE TO THIS FORMERLY ESOTERIC REALM. THE MASSES OFTRIP REPORTS ALLOW FOR VERIFICATION AND CROSS-CHECKING, AND HAVE PROBABLYPREVENTED MANY DISASTERS. SOME OF THE ENTRIES ARE SEQUENTIAL STUDIES OF A SINGLESUBSTANCE—THE NOTES OF HIGH-LEVEL TECHNICIANS, RETURNING AGAIN AND AGAIN TOTEST-DRIVE SOME LITTLE-KNOWN SHAMANIC INEBRIANT. LIKE COMMITTED ALCHEMISTS,THESE SEEKERS PROBE THE ESSENCE OF A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL CATALYST OR PLANTSPIRIT.OTHER REPORTS, MANY CAUTIONARY TALES, DESCRIBE THE FERVOR OF EXPERIMENTERS WHOMIX MULTIPLE MIND-ALTERERS, LOOKING FOR A ROCKET-RIDE TO THE FAR ANTIPODES OFTHE PSYCHE. THE TRIP REPORTS ARE A ROAD MAP OF SPECTACULAR NEOSHAMANICSUCCESSES, HAIR-RAISING FAILURES AND FRITZ-OUTS, AND BIZARRE SIGHTSEEING ALONGTHE WAY. “YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY” IS A COMMON CAUTIONARY NOTE.EVEN WITHOUT ANY CHEMICAL ADDITIVES, BURNING MAN IS DELIRIOUSLY MIND-EXPANDING.BLACK ROCK CITY IS THE PSYCHEDELIC VISION MADE VISCERAL. THE FESTIVAL IS ANHOMAGE TO THE WAY TRYPTAMINES EXPAND AWARENESS, OPEN PLAYGROUNDS OF UNDREAMTPOTENTIAL, REVEAL THE EROTIC CORE OF ALL INTERACTIONS. THE EVENT IS A HIGHLYEVOLVED, BRILLIANTLY ORGANIZED FOLLOW-UP TO THE BE-INS AND HAPPENINGS OF THE1960S. THE COMMUNAL SYSTEM AND “LEAVE NO TRACE” ECOLOGICAL RULE OF THE EVENTDESCEND FROM THE CONSCIENTIOUS POLITICS OF THE DIGGERS, A RADICAL GROUP THAT RANA FREE STORE IN HAIGHT-ASHBURY IN THE LATE 1960S. AT BURNING MAN, ALL THESUBCULTURES I HAD DISMISSED AS TRITE OR UNINTERESTING—GOTH, RAVER, NEW AGE,HIPPIE, PAGAN, PUNK, AND PIERCED, DECADES OF SULLEN SUBCULTURAL WRECKAGE—SEEMEDTO BE MELDING AND RECOMBINING LIKE ELEMENTS IN A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT, FUSINGINTO NEW, PROTEAN LIFE FORMS.“WHAT IS BURNING MAN? BURNING MAN IS A CYBERNETIC PULSE ENGINE FUELED BYINFORMATION,” DANGER RANGER, A GRAY-BEARDED FOUNDING FATHER OF THE FESTIVAL,TOLD ME LATER THAT WEEK, AS WE MONITORED THE WINDSWEPT CHAOS FROM HIS PICKUP.“BURNING MAN IS LIKE A PROGRAM THAT RUNS. IT COMES TOGETHER, IT COMPRESSES, THENIT EXPLODES.”WHEN THE SUN FADED, I RODE MY BICYCLE AROUND BLACK ROCK CITY. EACH YEAR, BURNINGMAN CONSISTS OF A SEMI-CIRCLE OF RINGS, DIVIDED INTO STREETS WITH THEMATICNAMES. THAT YEAR—2000—THE THEME WAS THE BODY. THE FIRST STREET, FACING THEPLAYA, WAS HEAD, FOLLOWED BY BRAIN, THROAT, HEART, GUT, SEX DRIVE, ANAL AVENUE,KNEE LANE, AND FEET. FROM THE CENTER OF THE CITY, A MAIN LAMP-LIT AVENUE LED OUTTO THE GLOWING FIFTY-TWO-FOOT-TALL MAN HIMSELF, RINGED BY SEQUENCED LIGHTS.ALONG THIS MAIN DRAG, THE BURN EQUIVALENT OF THE CHAMPS ELYSÉES, I RODE PAST AGIANT HEAD WITH THREE FACES: A METAL FACE WEEPING BURNING TEARS, A FACE MADEFROM DRIFTWOOD, AND A CLAY FACE WEEPING WATER. THERE WAS A GIANT CLAY PHALLUSAND YONI WITH LIT-UP CLIT, AND A THREE-STORY-HIGH INTERACTIVE ASSHOLE—YOUCLIMBED THE STAIRS AND PUSHED YOUR WAY THROUGH GLOWING RECTAL TISSUE TO SLIDEDOWN A STEEP CHUTE OUT THE OTHER SIDE.AT NIGHT, THE FESTIVAL TRANSMUTES INTO A LUMINOUS SPECTACLE. THERE AREGENERATOR-POWERED VIDEO PROJECTORS ON BILLOWING DOMES, FILMS, MAN-MADE LIGHTNINGBOLTS, FLAMETHROWERS, AND MULTIHUED LASERS ARCHING ACROSS THE STAR-SATURATEDDESERT SKY. PERSONAL ADORNMENT RUNS THE GAMUT FROM GLOWSTICKS AND FAIRY WINGS TOEXTRAORDINARY ELECTROLUMINESCENT OUTFITS OF FLASHING WIRES MOLDED INTO BEASTS,DEMONS, SERPENTS, ALIENS, OR ANGELS. ONE OF THE BEST OUTFITS I SAW REVEALED THEWEARER’S INTERNAL ANATOMY IN GLOWING WIRE, SENDING TRAILS OF LIGHT SHOOTING OUTFROM THE HEART ALONG THE VEINS, WHILE OTHER SEQUENCED FLASHES ILLUMINATED THEFILAMENTS OF NERVES, EROGENOUS ZONES, AND CHAKRA POINTS.BESIDES MASSES OF WALKERS AND PEOPLE ON THEIR GLOWING OR FURRY BICYCLES,LOVINGLY DECORATED ART CARS AND WIGGY TRANSPORT TRAINS PROMENADE ACROSS THEDESERT. THE ART CARS IN 2000 INCLUDE THE CHROMOZOOM, WITH A SPINNING DNA COIL; APIRATE SHIP FEATURING A RAUCOUS CROWD OF DRUNKEN SAILORS; A VARIETY OF MOVINGCOUCHES AND LIVING ROOMS AND TOILET SEATS; A FURRY NEON-COLORED CAT BUS, AND AMOBILE LOBSTER. MOST FABULOUS WAS A LONG DRAGON TRAIN THAT BREATHED FIRE WITH AFULL-BAR INSIDE ONE OF ITS ALWAYS-CROWDED COMPARTMENTS.DURING MY FIRST VISIT, I HARDLY SLEPT OR ATE, BIKING FRENETICALLY BACK AND FORTHOVER THE PLAYA, STOPPING AT WHATEVER CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. ONE NIGHT IT WAS THEFLAMING LOTUS COLLECTIVE, A TEAM OF COOL HIPPIE CHICKS WHO HAD BUILT AKILN-SHAPED LAUNCHPAD THAT SHOT CRIMSON PILLARS OF BIBLICAL FLAME ONE HUNDREDFEET INTO THE AIR AS ONLOOKERS BACKED AWAY FROM THE HEAT. AFTER EACH BLAST, THEWOMEN CRIED “YAY!” THEY JUMPED UP TO GIVE EACH OTHER WARM HUGS OF SUPPORT. THEFLAMING LOTUS WAS A HARMONIOUS MIXTURE OF FORCE, FIRE, AND FEMINITY—THE KIND OFSPECTACLE FOUND AT BURNING MAN, AND NOWHERE ELSE.. . .ONE NIGHT, WORD WENT AROUND THAT A FAMOUS BRITISH DJ WAS SPINNING ATILLUMINAUGHTY, ONE OF THE ENORMOUS RAVE CAMPS OF GLOWING PURPLE LIGHTS ANDDIGITAL VIDEO SCREENS, ALONG THE FAR EDGE OF THE PLAYA. HAVING MISPLACED MYBICYCLE, I SET OUT FOR THE CAMP ON FOOT, A SEVERAL-MILE TREK, AND QUICKLY LOSTALL OF MY FRIENDS. RAIN WAS FALLING HARD, TURNING THE DESERT DUST TO THICK MUD.AS I WALKED ALONE, THE LUMINOUS NIGHT PANORAMA OF BLACK ROCK CITY REVEALED ACREEPY CARNIVAL SHADOW, AN UNDERTONE OF DESPERATION.AT MOMENTS, BURNING MAN REMINDED ME OF NORMAN MAILER’S ARMIES OF THE NIGHT, ANAMBIVALENT TAKE ON THE COUNTERCULTURE DURING THE 1967 PENTAGON MARCH. “THE DRESSBALL WAS GOING INTO BATTLE,” HE WROTE. “NOW THE WITCHES WERE HERE, AND RITES OFEXORCISM, AND BLACK TERRORS OF THE NIGHT . . . THE HIPPIES HAD GONE FROM TIBETTO CHRIST TO THE MIDDLE AGES, NOW THEY WERE REVOLUTIONARY ALCHEMISTS.” LIKE MOSTLITERATI, THE HARD-DRINKING MAILER HATED PSYCHEDELICS: “THE NIGHTMARE WAS IN THEECHO OF THOSE TRIPS WHICH HAD FRACTURED THEIR SENSE OF PAST AND PRESENT. . . .THE HISTORY OF THE PAST WAS BEING EXPLODED RIGHT INTO THE PRESENT: PERHAPS THEREWERE NOW LACUNAE IN THE FIRMAMENT OF THE PAST, HOLES WHERE ONCE HAD BEEN THEPSYCHIC REALITY OF AN ERA WHICH WAS GONE.”SINCE MAILER’S BOOK, MEMORY LOSS—MASS-CULTURAL AMNESIA, RAMPANT ALZHEIMER’S,DISCONNECTION FROM HISTORY—HAS BECOME OUR DOMINANT CULTURAL PARADIGM. BURNINGMAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, CELEBRATES “THE HISTORY OF THE PAST” AS IT IS EXPLODEDINTO THE PRESENT—AS KITSCH SPECTACLE, MYTHIC IMAGE, OR, IN BENJAMIN’S PHRASE,“PROFANE ILLUMINATION.” IT IS POSSIBLE TO WITNESS A FULLY COSTUMED AZTECSACRIFICE ATOP A CARDBOARD ZIGGURAT, UNDERGO A MOCK EGYPTIAN BURIAL USING RITESFROM THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD, PARTICIPATE IN A SHIVAITE FIRE RITUAL—ALL INAN HOUR. THE ENTIRE EVENT SPOOFS SOME 1970S RETRO SCI-FI FANTASY OFPOSTAPOCALYPTIC TRIBALISM, AND THE BIG MAN’S CLIMACTIC BURNING SUMMONS UPANCIENT DRUIDIC SACRIFICIAL RITES FROM THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY BANKS. THE CONSTANTRIFFING ON THE PAST AMPLIFIES THE FESTIVAL’S HALLUCINATORY AMBIENCE. LIKE THEEFFECT OF CERTAIN CHEMICALS, BURNING MAN CHANGES ONE’S SENSE OF TIME, REVEALINGTHE MYTHIC UNDERPINNINGS, THE WHISPERS OF ETERNITY, UNDERNEATH THE MOST ORDINARYMOMENT. PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT DANGER RANGER MEANT WHEN HE TOLD ME, “I FOUND OUTTHERE IS A WAY YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS CAN GO BEYOND WHAT WE CALL NOW, AND I RODE THESHOCKWAVE OF INVERSE TIME.”. . .ON THE PLAYA I MET A YOUNG CALIFORNIA KID, LIGHT-BLOND-HAIRED WITH A BABY FACE,WHO WAS ESCAPING THE DRAGON TRAIN IN A HURRY. “IT’S MY EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY,” HETOLD ME. “I WAS IN THE DRAGON AND THIS FREAKY CHICK WITH HER TITS EXPOSED GAVEME A BIG SLOPPY KISS. THEN THIS NAKED FREAK NAMED MUSTARD SEED SAID, ‘I WANT TOTIE YOU TO A WHIPPING POST, YOU CUTE LITTLE BOY.’ I SAID I’M LEAVING. I DIDN’TWANT TO BE TIED TO A WHIPPING POST. I’VE SEEN MORE PSYCHO SHIT HERE THAN I’VESEEN BEFORE IN MY LIFE.”RAIN WAS SPLATTERING AS I REACHED THE THUNDERDOME, A POPULAR HAVEN FOR FANS OFTHE MAD MAX FLICKS, ITS EXUBERANT MOCK-VIOLENCE THE OPPOSITE OF BLACK ROCKCITY’S PEACE-AND-LOVE VIBE. INSIDE THE THUNDERDOME, TWO OPPONENTS ON BUNGEECORDS WERE BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER WITH FOAM-WRAPPED CLUBS, SPURREDON BY THE BANSHEE SHRIEKS AND BAT TRILLS OF A HUGE SLAVERING CROWD HANGING FROMTHE DOME’S METAL CROSS-SECTIONS. AN OPERA SINGER CAME OUT BETWEEN BOUTS,ACCOMPANIED BY FIRE SPINNERS, AND HER WAGNERIAN TRILLS SENT FLUTTERS DOWN MYSPINE.PAST THUNDERDOME WAS EMERALD CITY, A RAVE-ORIENTED THEME CAMP FEATURING AFORMIDABLE LASER. THIS MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PARTY TRICK HAD BEEN BROUGHT, ALONGWITH ITS LARGE COOLING TANK, BY TWO GENIUS MAD SCIENTISTS. THE LASER WAS BRANDNEW, DESIGNED AND BUILT IN THE MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT; IT SHOT SOLID GEOMETRICPATTERNS OUT INTO THE STRATOSPHERE, PROJECTED FRACTAL PATTERNS AND SACREDGEOMETRIES ON THE DANCING MASSES. A BALLOON HELD ON TO ITS BEAM REFRACTEDRAINBOWS ACROSS THE DARK PLAYA. THIS MAGICAL LASER SEEMED TO VIOLATE ALLPHYSICAL LAWS—FROM A DISTANCE IT APPEARED TO SEND A BAR OF SOLID WHITE LIGHTTOWARD THE STARS, WHERE IT STOPPED IN MIDAIR.IN FRONT OF THE SPEAKER TOWERS OF ILLUMINAUGHTY, HUNDREDS WERE DANCING BENEATH AVIDEO PROJECTION OF CHURNING FRACTAL PATTERNS. BUT THE FAMOUS DJ’S TINNY BEATSLEFT ME COLD—RAVE’S TREACLY GRAPHICS AND AMPHETAMINE RHYTHMS OF REPETITION AREJUST NOT MY THING. IT WAS PAST TWO A.M. SICK OF THE ICY RAIN, I RETREATED TO THENIPPLE LOUNGE, A BREAST-SHAPED CHILL-OUT TENT AT THE EDGE OF ILLUMINAUGHTY.INSIDE WAS PARADISE: COUCHES, PILLOWS, RUGS, BILLOWING FABRICS, HECTICDIALOGUES, WARM BODIES. A GLITTERY TEENAGE EDIE LOOK-ALIKE FROM THE MOONTRIBEWENT AROUND HUGGING EVERYONE SHE MET. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE SQUADRON OF MILITARYJETS FLYING ACROSS BLACK ROCK WITH UNSETTLING FREQUENCY.“THEY ARE SO SCARED OF US,” SHE SAID. “THEY KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE POWER.”MORE LIKELY THE PILOTS JUST WANTED TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SPECTACLE. I WASBEGINNING TO FEEL A STRONG SENSE OF DÉJÀ VU—NOT FOR SOMETHING I HAD LIVED BUTSOMETHING I HAD READ AND HEARD ABOUT. THE NEXT DAY, I ASKED JOHN PERRY BARLOW, AFORMER GRATEFUL DEAD LYRICIST AND SILICON VALLEY POLEMICIST, THE INEVITABLEQUESTION: WAS THIS ANYTHING LIKE THE SIXTIES?“THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE SIXTIES. SO MUCH LESS SELF-INDULGENT ANDDESPERATE, SO MUCH MORE RESTRAINED,” BARLOW ANSWERED. “WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS ALARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE TRYING TO PRACTICE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR STRANGERS, AND,FOR THE MOST PART, SUCCEEDING.”I FOUND BARLOW IN HIS RENTED RV—ONE OF MANY RVS RINGED AROUND SPIRAL OASIS, ATHEME CAMP THAT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME AS “AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL, RICHESTPEOPLE YOU COULD POSSIBLY MEET AT BURNING MAN.” ALTHOUGH THEIR SITE WAS FAR LESSLUXURIOUS THAN THE NEARBY CHURCH OF MEZ—ORCHESTRATED BY HIGH-LEVEL PROJECTMANAGERS FROM MICROSOFT, MEZ FEATURED A SIXTY-FOOT DJ TOWER AND ANEIGHTEEN-WHEEL TRUCK CONVERTED INTO A COSTUME SHOP AND KITCHEN PRESIDED OVER BYTHE FIVE-STAR CHEF FROM SEATTLE’S FOUR SEASONS—THE DENIZENS OF SPIRAL WEREENTHUSIASTIC PROPAGANDISTS FOR THE FESTIVAL.“THIS IS THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING THAT’S GOING ON RIGHT NOW, ALL OF THEPROGRESS. YOU ARE SEEING THE BEST FORM OF IT HERE,” I WAS TOLD BY KEN GOLDBERG,A ROBOTICS EXPERT WHO HAD JUST PUBLISHED A BOOK WITH MIT, AS HE DID ME THE FAVOROF SHAMPOOING MY DUST-CLOTTED HAIR BENEATH A SUN SHOWER.“IT IS AMAZING TO SEE VIRGINS ARRIVE AT BLACK ROCK,” ADDED MARK PESCE, THEINVENTOR OF VRML, A VIRTUAL REALITY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. “AFTER FIVE OR TENMINUTES, THEY SAY, ‘OH MY GOD, I’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS ALL MY LIFE.’ THIS ISTHE EPICENTER OF A FREE CULTURE.” PESCE HAD FOUNDED A GROUP CALLED THE “CHURCHOF THE MOTHERFUCKERS,’’ BASED ON AN OBSCURE SMOKABLE POWDER THAT SEEMS TOCREATE, IN A FEW MINUTES, THE EFFECT OF EXPLODING OUT INTO THE COSMOS. “MY GODIT IS AMAZING,” SAID PESCE. HIS FELLOW PSYCHONAUTS COULD ONLY DESCRIBE IT AS“THERMONUCLEAR CONTACT WITH THE DIVINE.”THE CENTERPIECE OF SPIRAL OASIS WAS A POPULAR TRAMPOLINE AND AN OPEN-AIRSUNSHOWER. ITS PUBLIC PROJECT WAS A HYPERMODERN FETISH BAR CALLED ALIEN SEX CLUB(FEATURING A TANK WHERE RUBBERIZED ALIEN EXHIBITIONISTS COULD DISPLAY THEIRMOVES; A WALL WITH TENTACLES ALLOWING FOR BRUSQUE FEEL-UPS OF THE UNKNOWNSSTANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE). ALONG WITH ITS SILICON VALLEY BRAIN TRUST, SPIRAL’SINHABITANTS INCLUDED HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS AND ACTORS, SWEDISH SUPERMODELS,CORPORATE LAWYERS, A CHEF, AND A HAIRDRESSER—130 PEOPLE IN ALL. GOLDBERG’S WIFE,TIFFANY SHLAIN, HAD CREATED THE “WEBBIES” AWARDS, AN ANNUAL SHOWCASE FOR THEDIGITERATI DURING THEIR BRIEF GOLDEN AGE. ALSO PRESENT WAS TIFFANY’S FATHER,LEONARD SHLAIN, WEARING A SOFT REMBRANDT HAT. HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE ALPHABETAND THE GODDESS, A WORK OF NEW AGE PREHISTORICAL REVISIONISM WITH THE THESISTHAT PATRIARCHY WAS INSCRIBED IN WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND THE NEW POSTLITERATEELECTRONIC CULTURE WOULD BRING BACK THE GOLDEN AGE OF MATRIARCHAL GODDESSWORSHIP—IT SOUNDED A BIT SHAKY TO ME. I TOLD HIM I WAS FROM NEW YORK.“AH, NEW YORK—A CITY WITHOUT FOREPLAY,” HE SAID. “WHEN YOU ARRIVE THERE, THEREIS NO LUBRICATION, NO HESITATION. THEY JUST GIVE IT TO YOU STRAIGHT.”AT SPIRAL, THE MUSIC WAS AMBIENT, THE MOOD WAS MELLOW, CLOTHING WAS OPTIONAL,AND IT WAS EASY TO FALL INTO A DISCUSSION STRETCHING FROM THE EPISTEMOLOGICALCONUNDRUMS RAISED BY ROBOT CONSCIOUSNESS, TO THE DOLPHIN SCIENTIST JOHN LILLY’STHEORIES ABOUT METAPROGRAMMING THE HUMAN BIOCOMPUTER, AND THE ANTHROPOLOGICALEVIDENCE FOR AN ANCIENT TRIBE OF HIGH PLAINS INDIANS WHO SMOKED DMT ALL DAYLONG."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13DOCTOR MEGAVOLT[images/00006.jpg] BURNING MAN IS MORE DECADENT THAN WARHOL’S FACTORY, MOREGLAMOROUS THAN BERLIN IN THE 1920S, MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE MOST LAVISH BUSBYBERKELEY MUSICAL, MORE OF A LOVE-FEST THAN PEPPERLAND, MORE ANARCHIC THANGROUCHO MARX’S FREEDONIA, MORE IMPLAUSIBLE THAN ANY MIRAGE.THE FESTIVAL REWIRES YOUR SENSE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE NOW.BUT PERHAPS THE MOST INTOXICATING ASPECT OF BURNING MAN, AS WALTER BENJAMINMIGHT HAVE PUT IT, IS THINKING ABOUT BURNING MAN. ALSO DREAMING ABOUT IT—MANYVISITORS DREAM THROUGH THE YEAR OF RETURNING TO THE PLAYA. IN DREAMS OF MY OWN,BURNING MAN TAKES PLACE IN AN ABANDONED FACTORY BUILDING IN QUEENS, NOW OVERRUNWITH GLITTERING HIPSTERS; OR IT HAS “SOLD OUT” AND BECOME A SAD CARNIVAL IN ASEASIDE TOWN; OR IT IS THE LAST EUPHORIC GATHERING OF HUMANITY IN A RADIOACTIVEWASTELAND; OR I AM WAITING, ALONE, FOR DAWN TO RISE OVER THE DESERT’S LUNARSURFACE. ALMOST EVERY NIGHT FOR MONTHS AFTER MY VISITS, THE FESTIVAL TURNS UP INSOME FORM IN MY INTERIOR THEATER.A FEW BURNERS NEVER RETURN TO THE MAINSTREAM. IN NEW YORK, I MET J., FORMERLYTHE ADVERTISING DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR BUSINESS MAGAZINE. AFTER HE WENT TO BURNINGMAN, HE ABORTED HIS CAREER AND MORPHED INTO A MAD-EYED AVATAR OF OUTDOOR PARTIESAND TRANCE MUSIC, LIVING ON THE BOHEMIAN MARGIN OF NEW YORK—A THIN MARGIN THESEDAYS. HE CHRISTENED HIMSELF “MACHINE ELF,” DRESSING AS A SCI-FI WARLOCK WITHHORNS AND CAPE AT ALL-NIGHT OUTLAW PARTIES HE ORCHESTRATED UNDER THE CITY’SBRIDGES.BURNING MAN STARTED IN 1986, WHEN LARRY HARVEY, A BARELY EMPLOYED LANDSCAPEARCHITECT AND OVERAGED BIKE MESSENGER, BUILT AN EIGHT-FOOT-TALL WOODEN EFFIGY OFA MAN AFTER A PAINFUL BREAK-UP, THEN TORCHED IT ON BAKER BEACH IN SAN FRANCISCO.IT FELT SO GOOD THAT HE RETURNED THE NEXT YEAR WITH MORE OF HIS FRIENDS TO DO ITAGAIN. AS IT GREW, THE EVENT WAS LISTED IN THE NEWSLETTER OF THE CACOPHONYSOCIETY, A LOOSELY KNIT BAY AREA GROUP OF “CULTURE JAMMERS,” PRANKSTERS WHODISTORT THE MESSAGES OF THE CORPORATE MEDIA. THE CACOPHONY SOCIETY HAD DEVELOPEDOUT OF THE COLLAPSE OF AN EARLIER AND MORE INSULAR GROUP, THE SUICIDE CLUB, APREPUNK, POSTHIPPIE UNDERGROUND NETWORK FORMED IN THE 1970S.HARVEY INTENDED THE MAN AS A FREE-FLOATING SYMBOL: AN IMAGE OF TRANSIENCE ORSPIRITUAL REGENERATION, A SIGNALING BEACON FOR A NEW POSTHUMANISM, OR AREIGNITING POINT FOR THE SPENT ENERGIES OF A SUPPRESSED AND DEPRESSEDCOUNTERCULTURE AT THE END OF THE REAGAN EIGHTIES. IN 1990, THE BURN WAS TOO BIGFOR THE BEACH AND THEY RELOCATED TO THE BARREN WASTES OF THE NEVADA DESERT.“AS SOON AS WE STEPPED ONTO THIS DESERT, I KNEW THIS HAD TREMENDOUS POTENTIALFOR GROWTH,” HARVEY SAYS. “THE PLAYA WAS LIKE AN ENORMOUS BLANK CANVAS.”HARVEY IS THE FOUNDER AND A BELOVED FIGURE IN BURNING MAN’S SELF-PERPETUATINGMYTHOLOGY. A GRUFF CHAINSMOKER IN A COWBOY HAT, HE RUNS THE EVENT WITH AFULL-TIME YEAR-ROUND STAFF OF TWELVE. THEY PAY THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENTABOUT $500,000 TO USE THE SITE EACH YEAR. TICKET SALES, STARTING AT $125 EARLYIN THE YEAR AND RISING TO MORE THAN $200 FOR LATECOMERS, AS WELL AS DONATIONS,COVER THEIR COSTS. HARVEY’S CURRENT PLOT IS REPLICATING BURNING MANS ACROSS THEGLOBE, AND HIS STAFF IS ACTIVELY NETWORKING THEIR EXPERTISE TO LOCALIZED,SMALL-SCALE VERSIONS OF THE FESTIVAL.“THAT FIRST YEAR IN THE DESERT, WE DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING,” RECALLED DANGERRANGER, THE GRAY-BEARDED FOUNDER OF THE BLACK ROCK RANGERS, WHICH IS NOW A CORPSOF TWO HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS TRAINED TO MEDIATE AND PROBLEM-SOLVE. “IT WAS SO HOTWE CRAWLED UNDER OUR CARS LIKE LIZARDS.”THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE FESTIVAL AND ITS FLAWLESS SELF-ORGANIZING STRUCTURE AREDIRECT PRODUCTS OF THE INTERNET. AMONG THE ATTENDANTS AT BURNING MAN CAN BEFOUND A TREMENDOUS BRAIN TRUST OF SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS, SILICON VALLEYENGINEERS AND CEOS. WHILE ARTISTS CAN ACCESS THE EVENT’S BRAIN TRUST OFTECHNICIANS TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR PROJECTS—“WE HAVE RESOURCES OF TECHNICALKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY CORPORATIONS LACK,” SAID ONE SCULPTOR—SCIENTISTS ANDENGINEERS USE THE BURN AS THEIR CREATIVE OUTLET. BRIEFLY ESCAPING CORPORATE JOBSOR UNIVERSITY LABS, THEY FIND RELEASE IN FLAUNTING THEIR TOOLS BEFORE A LIVE ANDJUBILANT AUDIENCE. “BLACK ROCK CITY SHOWS IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE A SOCIETYBASED ON PLAY,” SAID RUSSEL WILCOX, A LASER ENGINEER FOR LAWRENCE LIVERMORELABORATORIES WHO DONATES WORK TO THE EVENT—IN 2000, HE CREATED A GREENCRISSCROSSING LASER DISPLAY FORMING A BURNING MAN INSIGNIA, VISIBLE FROMOUTERSPACE. “JUST DOING SOMETHING WHERE PLAY IS AT THE HEART OF EVERYINTERACTION IS IMPLICITLY POLITICAL.”WALKING AROUND OR HANGING OUT IN THE CAFE, I WOULD MAKE GREAT NEW FRIENDS ANDJUST AS SUDDENLY LOSE THEM FOREVER. AT NIGHT, AT THE THEME CAMPS, SOCIALCONSTELLATIONS WOULD SUDDENLY FORM FOR A FEW HOURS AND THEN DISPERSE INTORANDOMNESS. LIKE STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET, BURNERS PLAY WITH THEIR PERSONAS,PICKING UP AND DISCARDING NEW IDENTITIES, NEW FRIENDS, NEW IDEAS, AT HYPERSPEED.“DURING THE DAY, I’M ALADDIN RIDING A MAGIC CARPET; AT NIGHT, I’M A MANTA RAY,”SAID A CREATIVE DIRECTOR FROM ADOBE PHOTOSHOP, WRAPPED IN ARABIAN TUNIC. “I’M APRETTY AMAZING CLOSET EXHIBITIONIST. THIS EVENT FEEDS MY DESIRE FOR PEOPLE TOSAY, ‘YOU’RE WONDERFUL, YOU’RE GREAT.’ ”IN 1995, TWO PEOPLE DIED—ONE, APPARENTLY A SUICIDE; THE SECOND, RUN OVER IN HISTENT BY A CAR GONE OFF COURSE. IN THE AFTERMATH, THE ORGANIZERS HAD TO MAKE ACHOICE. DID THEY WANT THEIR EVENT TO REMAIN A LAWLESS RODEO FOR FREAKS, OR DIDTHEY WANT TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO GROW? TAKING THE PATH OF EVOLUTION, THEY BANNEDFIREARMS, TOOK UNAUTHORIZED CARS OFF THE PLAYA, RAISED TICKET PRICES, ANDIMPOSED ORDER ON CHAOS. THE YEARS OF THE DOT-COM BUBBLE BROUGHT THOUSANDS OF NEWPARTICIPANTS, FLUSH WITH IPO CASH. BUT THE BURSTING OF THE BUBBLE DID NOT LOWERATTENDANCE. IF ANYTHING, THE 2001 BURN SEEMED MORE RAUCOUS, MORE EXTRAVAGANT ANDEXPLORATORY, THAN THE YEAR BEFORE.ONE OF THE SCULPTORS TOLD ME, “BURNING MAN WAS THE LAST GREAT ART MOVEMENT OFTHE TWENTIETH CENTURY, AND THE FIRST GREAT ART MOVEMENT OF THE TWENTY-FIRSTCENTURY.” ALTHOUGH ART IS INTEGRAL TO THE EVENT, THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE ARTISTVANISHES IN THE SWEEPING SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. BURNING MAN ENACTS THE GERMANARTIST JOSEPH BEUYS’S CONCEPT OF “SOCIAL SCULPTURE”—A COMMUNAL AESTHETIC THATGOES BEYOND PRIVATE EGOTISM. UNLIKE THE SELF-CONSCIOUSLY PRICKLY WORKS OF THEINSIDER ART WORLD IN NEW YORK, THE PROJECTS DISPLAYED AT BURNING MAN AREEXPLICITLY USER-FRIENDLY, POP INSPIRED, COMMUNITY-ORIENTED, EXPERIENTIAL. THEYARE NOT INTENDED FOR MUSEUMS. THEY ARE MEANT TO BE TOUCHED AND THEN TORCHED.A POSTMODERN POP ART PHANTASM, BURNING MAN CONSTANTLY MOCKS AND UNDERCUTS ITSOWN PRETENTIONS. IT IS AN ENDLESSLY INVOLUTING IMITATION OF ITSELF. “EVERYTHINGOUT HERE IS A MYTH. YOU INVENT YOUR OWN REALITY,” ONE OF THE ARTISTS TOLD ME.“THAT’S PART OF THE GRAND EXPERIENCE: WE MAKE THESE GRAND MYTHS TO GO WITH IT.”THE FESTIVAL IS ALSO A SELF-CONSCIOUS PARODY OF ESOTERIC INITIATION, THERITUALIZED USHERING INTO THE MYSTERIES LAST SEEN IN THE WESTERN WORLD ATELEUSIS.ON SATURDAY, THE FESTIVAL’S CRESCENDO, MY FRIEND JON GOT LOST IN THE WANDERINGMASSES. HE ENDED UP AT THE CHAPEL OF PLASTIC, A BEAUTIFUL, TRANSLUCENT STRUCTUREOUT ON THE PLAYA THAT RESEMBLES STAINED GLASS. HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A MASSWEDDING CEREMONY. A SEX COLUMNIST WAS MARRYING EVERYONE TO THEMSELVES. JON WASUNCERTAIN WHETHER HE WANTED TO MAKE THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT, BUT HE TOOK THEVOW. LATER HE WAS WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS FOR BURNING DOWN THE MAN—AFIFTY-TWO-FOOT-TALL SCULPTURE THAT IS FILLED WITH EXPLOSIVES AND IGNITED. HEBECAME INCREASINGLY CERTAIN THAT HE WAS THE MAN—WHEN THEY BURNED IT DOWN, THEYWOULD BE DESTROYING HIM AS WELL. HE LOOKED AT THE FACES AROUND HIM AND SAWSINISTER MOTIVES. “SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT BURNING MAN WAS FORCING ALL OF THESEUNSUSPECTING PEOPLE TO JOIN A DIABOLICAL CULT OF DEVIL WORSHIP,” HE SAID. THEDAY AFTER THE BURN, HE SEEMED CALM AND WELL-SATISFIED. THE FLAMES HAD CONSUMEDHIS PARANOIA. IF HE STILL SAW THE EVENT AS A SATANIC CULT, HE WAS PROUD TO HAVEJOINED.ONE OF THE FESTIVAL’S ICONS IS DOCTOR MEGAVOLT, A PAIR OF RATTLE-SHAPED TESLACOILS, RESEMBLING BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN MOVIE PROPS, TWO-STORY-TALL GENERATORSMOUNTED ON A RAISED, MOBILE PLATFORM, WITH A SPACE BETWEEN THEM. CHARGED WITHFIFTY THOUSAND VOLTS OF ENERGY, MEGAVOLT SHOOTS VIOLET-EDGED LIGHTNING BOLTS INALL DIRECTIONS, CRACKLING INTO THE BLACK NIGHT IN INSTANTLY BRANCHING ANDSUDDENLY FADING ZIGZAGS LIKE ELECTRICAL ORGASMS. WHEN A MAN OR WOMAN IN A METALSUIT STANDS BETWEEN THE TESLA COILS, SOMETHING CALLED THE FARADAY PRINCIPLE INPHYSICS TAKES HOLD, PROTECTING THEM FROM FRYING AS THEY REACH OUT TO CONDUCTLIGHTNING BOLTS THROUGH THEIR FINGERS, SMASH THEM AGAINST THEIR HELMET, PLAYWITH FIFTY THOUSAND VISIBLE VOLTS LIKE A CHILD MIGHT DREAM OF DOING, TO THEINTENSE DELIGHT OF A HUGE CROWD OF THE NAKED AND THE GLOWING AND THE FULLYCOSTUMED, SCREAMING “MEGAVOLT! MEGAVOLT!” OVER AND OVER AT THE TOP OF THEIRLUNGS, UNTIL THE LAST DROP OF JUICE IS SPENT.LATER I SPOKE TO JOHN BEHRENS, THE BERKELEY PHYSICIST WHO CREATED MEGAVOLT. “ITIS A SYNTHESIS OF ART AND SCIENCE,” HE TOLD ME. “IT CREATES AN EVENT THAT ISEXTREMELY INTERACTIVE BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE. IT ALLOWS US, THE PEOPLE IN THESUITS, TO COMMUNE DIRECTLY WITH ELECTRICITY. THE SENSATION OF LIGHTNING ARCSHITTING YOUR BODY IS VERY CEREBRAL.”MEGAVOLT EMBODIES THE ESSENCE OF BURNING MAN. IF THE EVENT CAN BE REDUCED TO ONESINGLE CONCEPT, IT IS “TRANSFORMATION”: TRANSFORMATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS,TRANSFORMATION OF ARTISTIC CREATIVITY INTO ECSTATIC COMMUNION, OF SCULPTURESINTO FLAMES AND ASH, OF THE INVISIBLE FORCE OF ELECTRICITY INTO A DEATH-DEFYINGGAME, OF ALL KINDS OF ENERGY INTO EACH OTHER.ABOVE ALL, TRANSFORMATION OF THE SELF. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FESTIVAL, MANYPEOPLE START NEW RELATIONSHIPS OR END OLD ONES, SWITCH CONTINENTS OR CAREERS,REMAKE THEIR LIVES IN DRAMATIC WAYS. “AFTER LAST YEAR, WHEN MY BOYFRIEND AND IGOT BACK TO CALGARY, WE SAID, ‘WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH OUR LIVES?’ ” I WAS TOLDBY A YOUNG CANADIAN GIVING AWAY HER POEMS IN THE CENTER CAFE. “WE QUIT OUR JOBSAND WENT TO CENTRAL AMERICA FOR FOUR MONTHS.” UNFORTUNATELY, THE MODERN WORLDDOESN’T ALWAYS REWARD ITS SEEKERS: “WE’RE BACK IN CALGARY NOW, TRYING TO PAY OFFOUR DEBTS,” SHE ADMITTED. “IT’S SORT OF SAD. REALITY STEPPED IN FRONT OF US LIKEA BRICK WALL.” SHE SAID SHE WAS WORKING AS A SECRETARY.THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL ENERGY IS EXPRESSED BY THE ICONIC HOBBY OF THE FESTIVAL:FIRE-SPINNING, IN WHICH A BURNER (OFTEN CLAD IN GOTH LEATHER) SPINS TORCHES ONCHAINS AROUND HIS OR HER BODY, SILENT EXCEPT FOR THE RUSH OF AIR SWISHING AROUNDTHE PINWHEELING FLAMES. FOR THE DURATION OF THE FLAMES, THE SPINNER BECOMESTHEIR OWN SOLITARY ATOM—A NEUTRON WITH FOUR FLAMING ELECTRONS SWIRLING AROUND INA SOLEMN BALANCING ACT THAT DID NOT INTEREST ME AT ALL UNTIL I STARTED TO FINDIT MESMERIZING AND BEAUTIFUL.CITIZENS OF BLACK ROCK CITY ARE A WIDE RANGE OF TYPES: SMUG SILICON VALLEYSUPERSTARS WHO FLY INTO THE EVENT ON PRIVATE PLANES, ARTISTS OF ALL STRIPES,TECH WORKERS, SEX WORKERS, SOCIAL ACTIVISTS, SECRETIVE OCCULTISTS, BLANDTHRILL-SEEKERS, SINISTER VOYEURS. THERE IS A SELECTION OF THOSE WHO HAVEENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE DOMINANT CULTURE—FREAKS, IF YOU WILL. THIS LASTGROUP INCLUDES WOMEN WHO KNOW THEY ARE WITCHES, WHO ARE IN TOUCH WITH SECRETCURRENTS OF THE NIGHT, SUCH AS JENNY GREENTEETH, HER NAME SWIPED FROM A FAIRYTALE, WHO DESCRIBED HOW, WHILE TRIPPING ON AN OBSCURE SUBSTANCE, A YIN-YANGSYMBOL ONCE SHOT ACROSS HER ROOM INTO HER THIRD EYE, SENDING HER INTO MEDITATIVESAMADHI. THERE ARE MEN WITH THE SHAMANIC DISPOSITION, SEEKING THE TOOLS TO HEALTHE DESOULED, SUCH AS THE TWO NAKED GUYS WHO SAT ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAFE GIVINGTAROT CARD READINGS; OR “TEDDYBEAR MAN,” WANDERING THE FESTIVAL IN A THICK COATOF STITCHED-TOGETHER STUFFED ANIMALS, DISPENSING HUGS AND WISE WORDS. AFTER THEBURN, TEDDYBEAR MAN WAS GOING TO HELP THE CHUMASH INDIANS BUILD A SWEATLODGE—PUTTING OFF REENTRY INTO THE “REAL WORLD” FOR AS LONG AS HE POSSIBLYCOULD.. . .BY SATURDAY MORNING, THE ENTIRE DESERT WAS A MUD PILE THAT FORMED A SQUISHINGSEVEN-LAYER CAKE UNDER MY SNEAKERS AT EVERY STEP. AT THE CENTER CAFE, THE BANDON STAGE RESEMBLED A LATTER-DAY SIMULATION OF THE SIXTIES HIPPIE GROUP THE FUGS.THEY WORE INDIAN ROBES AND KAFTANS, LONG BEARDS AND HIPPIE BEADS. THEIR SONGCONSISTED OF ONE MONOTONOUS CHANT REPEATED OVER AND OVER, AS THE CROWD OFSEVERAL HUNDRED RAPTUROUSLY JOINED IN: “FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!” THAT AFTERNOON, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS WENT ON ITS ANNUAL LABOR DAYMARCH ACROSS THE PLAYA. MODELING THEMSELVES ON APOCALYPSE CULTURE OF THE 1970SAND EARLY 1980S—ROAD WARRIER, DEVO, THE SEX PISTOLS, THE PLASMATICS—THE DPW ISBLACK ROCK’S DEDICATED CADRE OF FREE LABOR. THEIR SLOGAN IS “IF YOU DON’TMATTER, WE DON’T CARE.” HARVEY CALLS THEM “SPEED FREAKS WITH POWER TOOLS.” THEYBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TEAR IT DOWN IN THE WEEKS AFTERWARD. NOW THEY WEREGYRATING—RAW, COOKED, CROCKED, CRACKED—ATOP THEIR TRUCKS AND FORKLIFTS ANDCATERPILLARS AND SMASHED CARS, SCREAMING INSULTS, SPITTING LONG FUNNELS OF BEER,SWOOSHING LONG TAILS OF FIRE FROM FLAMETHROWERS AT THE APPRECIATIVE CROWD. ONEBLACK-BEARDED RASPUTIN-LIKE GUY IN A SMALL BOBCAT CRASHED REPEATEDLY AGAINST THEBATTERED TRUCKS, REVVING AGAINST THEM LIKE A VICIOUS LITTLE DOG TRYING TO GETOFF ON SOME BIGGER ONES.“GO BACK TO YOUR CUBICLE! GO BACK TO YOUR COMPUTER! GET OUT OF OUR REALITY!” THEDPW CHANTED.THE CROWD NODDED APPRECIATIVELY BUT DID NOT BUDGE."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14GREAT ROBOT EMPIRES[images/00006.jpg] DURING MY FIRST VISIT TO BURNING MAN, I SPENT MY LAST NIGHTSITTING IN FRONT OF THE HEART OF THE MAN. THE HEART WAS A LARGE FURNACE, WELDEDTOGETHER FROM SHEETS OF METAL, SHAPED LIKE THE HUMAN HEART, WITH STACKS OF LOGSNEXT TO IT FOR FUEL. WHEN IT WAS STOKED FULL AND THE BELLOWS WAS PUMPED, THEHEART ACTUALLY BEAT A DEEP RED. YELLOW SPARKS SHOT OUT OF ITS VENTRICLES. THEHEART SPREAD A CIRCLE OF INVITING WARMTH AROUND IT IN THE COLD DESERT NIGHT, ANDI SANK DOWN AND STAYED THERE, AMONG OTHER QUIET BURNERS, MEDITATING ANDHALF-DOZING, UNTIL MORNING.WHEN I RETURNED TO NEW YORK A FEW DAYS LATER, I CHECKED MY E-MAIL AND DISCOVEREDTHAT DAN LIEBERMAN, THE BOTANIST WHO TOOK ME TO GABON, WAS DEAD. HE HAD DIED INA FREAK CAR ACCIDENT ON A FLAT SOUTH AFRICAN HIGHWAY; HE WAS ASLEEP IN THEBACKSEAT WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED. IT WAS HIS THIRTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.I RECALLED HOW LIEBERMAN SAID HE HAD BEEN SHOWN, DURING HIS IBOGA TRIP, THAT HEWASN’T GOING TO LIVE VERY LONG. HE WAS VERY CHASTENED BY THIS. I HAD TAKEN ITLIGHTLY. IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO ME, AT THAT POINT, THAT A DRUG, NO MATTER HOWVISIONARY, COULD PREDICT ONE’S FATE WITH ANY ACCURACY.THERE WAS AN E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR DAN’S PARENTS. I WROTE A CONDOLENCE LETTER TOTHEM, PRAISING HIS COURAGE AND CONVICTION. I ASSUMED THAT WOULD BE MY CLOSESTBRUSH WITH DEATH FOR THE DAY.LATER THAT AFTERNOON I RECEIVED SOME WORRIED CALLS FROM FRIENDS OF MY FATHER’S.NOBODY HAD HEARD FROM MY DAD FOR OVER A WEEK. I HAD LEFT MESSAGES FOR HIM ATHOME, BUT ASSUMED HE WAS STAYING OUT IN THE COUNTRY—HE HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED ATINY CABIN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. BUT HIS FRIENDS SAID HE WAS NO LONGER UPSTATE.WITH AN INCREASINGLY HEAVY FOREBODING, I WENT TO HIS SOHO LOFT WITH THE POLICETHAT NIGHT. WHILE I WAITED DOWNSTAIRS WITH LAURA AND TWO OF MY FATHER’S PAINTERFRIENDS, THE POLICE BROKE IN AND FOUND MY FATHER’S BODY IN THE BATHROOM. FROMTHE MEDICAL EXAMINER, I LEARNED HE HAD DIED OF HEART FAILURE SOME DAYSAGO—PERHAPS MY LAST NIGHT AT BURNING MAN, AS I SAT IN FRONT OF THE HEART. HE WASSIXTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD.MY FATHER HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM A HEART CONDITION FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BUT HEHAD NOT DIVULGED TO ANYBODY HOW SERIOUS HIS CONDITION WAS—I THINK HE WAS HIDINGIT FROM HIMSELF MOST OF ALL. IN THE LAST MONTHS OF HIS LIFE HE SEEMED REMARKABLYCHEERFUL AND CALM, AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF, AND PAIN-FREE.WHILE AT BURNING MAN, I OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT MY FATHER. I WONDERED WHAT HE WOULDMAKE OF THE SPECTACLE. MY DAD WAS AN ABSTRACT PAINTER. HE AND HIS FRIENDS WERENEW YORK SURVIVORS. BORN IN ENGLAND, HE HAD ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN 1960, PART OFTHE SECOND WAVE OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM. MY DAD NEVER MADE IT IN THE ARTWORLD. AN IDEALIST, HE WAS INCAPABLE OF STRATEGIZING ABOUT HIS WORK OR PLAYINGART-WORLD POLITICS. IN ANY CASE, AFTER THE RISE OF POP AND CONCEPTUALISM,SINCERE ABSTRACT ART WAS SEEN AS SLOW-FOOTED AND RETROGRADE. STRANDED OUTSIDE OFTHE ART WORLD, HE WORKED CONSTANTLY—OBSESSED WITH PAINTING, A DIEHARD BELIEVERIN THE TRANSCENDENT VALUE OF ART. I OFTEN DESPAIRED WHEN I THOUGHT OF HISCANVASSES—OF THE DECADES OF WORK IN HIS LOFT, OF HIS SOLIPSISM AND HIS GIFT, HISLOVE OF THE CRAFT, AND HIS SOLITARY PURSUIT OF THE IDEAL.. . .AFTER FINDING MY FATHER’S BODY IN HIS LOFT, AFTER FIGHTING THROUGH THE CITY’SNERVE-RACKING BUREAUCRACY OF DEATH, WHICH IS ITS OWN SPECIAL PUNISHMENT OF THELIVING, AFTER CLEARING OUT DECADES OF JUNK, AFTER RECOVERING FROM THE INITIALSHOCK OF GRIEF, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIS WORKS. HE HAD LEFT OVER 230PAINTINGS AND 50 SCULPTURES IN HIS LOFT ON GREENE STREET—THE RELICS OF HISLIFELONG INVESTIGATION. SOME OF THEM WERE ENORMOUS, AS MUCH AS 10 OR 15 FEETLONG. ONE ROLLED-UP CANVAS MEASURED 25 FEET.HIS EARLIER PAINTINGS WERE HARD-EDGED AND GEOMETRICAL. HIS LATER WORKS SUGGESTEDCOSMIC CHAOS, NIGHT-LIT ABYSSES, FEVER DREAMS, THE EXISTENTIAL CONFINEMENT OFTHE SELF IN ITS PRISON TOWER. THEY EXPRESSED AWKWARDNESS AND GRACE, RADIANCE ANDREVELATION, MYSTICAL HOPE AND EXISTENTIAL HORROR. THEY REMINDED ME OF HENRYMILLER RIFFING FOR PAGES ON ANY SUBJECT—ON A WALK HE TOOK AS A CHILD, ON ALONG-LOST FRIEND, OR FLOURISHING SOME METAPHYSICAL CONCEIT. MILLER’S PASSAGESSKATE TOWARD THE EDGE OF COLLAPSE WITH CARELESS ABANDON, BUT CIRCLE BACK TOENSNARE HIS MEANING WITH PRECISION. SCUFFED, BOHEMIAN, ALMOST ABJECT YET ODDLYREDEMPTIVE, MY DAD’S PAINTINGS HAD THAT QUALITY OF A CRISIS CONFRONTED, ADISASTER AVERTED, BUT JUST BARELY.IN HIS LAST YEARS HE EXERCISED THE FREEDOM OF SOMEONE WHO HAD DROPPED OFF THEMAP. ESCAPING ALL FASHIONS AND TRENDS, HE GAVE UP FOLLOWING ANYTHING EXCEPT HISOWN SOLITARY PATH. IN THE PAINTINGS, HE WAS WHISPERING OVER AND OVER THEINVISIBLE SECRET HE HAD CARRIED WITH HIM ALL HIS LIFE—FROM HIS EARLY CHILDHOODIN BRIGHTON TO THE MONEY-MAD MANHATTAN WHERE HE HAD BECOME AN ANACHRONISM—THATPHANTOM OF MEANING AND FORM THAT HAD HAUNTED HIM. WORKING IN SOLITUDE, HE PROVEDTHE THEOREM TO HIMSELF ALONE.HIS BOOKSHELVES WERE FILLED WITH BOOKS ON PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY AND BUDDHISM.HE READ CONSTANTLY—BLANCHOT, DERRIDA, WITTGENSTEIN, NIETZSCHE. OVERVIEWS OFBLACK HOLES AND SUPERSTRINGS, EXTRA DIMENSIONS AND CHAOS THEORY. SOME OF HISLATE PAINTINGS COULD BE SEEN AS POETIC IMAGES OF QUANTUM WEIRDNESS, MOLECULARTRANSFORMATIONS, THE SPACE-CURVING FORCE OF GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS. HIS ART WASHIS SPIRITUAL PATH. ON HIS DESK I FOUND A SCRAWLED NOTE THAT SAID, SIMPLY: “THENEED TO BELIEVE.”BEFORE HIS DEATH, I SOMEHOW HADN’T REALIZED HOW MUCH OUR INTERESTS COINCIDED.THE REPEATED SHAPES IN HIS LATER WORKS WERE EXPLICITLY PRIMORDIAL AND BASIC.THEY CALLED TO MIND THE TILTED MENHIRS OF STONEHENGE, AS WELL AS CRUDE AFRICANARTIFACTS. MY FATHER WAS SEEKING SOME MYSTICAL PATHWAY OUT OF THE CONTEMPORARYCUL DE SAC.READING HIS NOTEBOOKS, I REALIZED HE WAS AMBIVALENT ABOUT LIVING INTO THE NEWCENTURY; HE WROTE ABOUT FEELING THE SOCIETY WAS INCREASINGLY DEPERSONALIZED,INHUMAN. HE NEVER OWNED A COMPUTER, NEVER RECEIVED AN E-MAIL. HE DREADED WHAT HECALLED “THE GREAT ROBOT EMPIRES OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.” HE SUSPECTED THATHIS BELIEF SYSTEM, THE EXISTENTIAL AND HANDMADE AURA OF HIS LIFE AND WORK, WERENOT GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO THIS NEW ERA.. . .OVER TIME, I FOUND THAT MY PSYCHEDELIC EXPLORATIONS HAD RESIDUAL BENEFITS. FORMANY YEARS I HAD RECALLED ALMOST NONE OF MY DREAMS, AND THOSE FEW THAT CAME BACKTO ME WERE FEEBLE FRAGMENTS, GRAY SLIVERS, AND BLAND VOIDS. AFTER DABBLING INMIND-EXPANSION, I REDISCOVERED MY DREAM LIFE. DREAMS NOW MANIFESTED EACH NIGHTIN FULL COLOR, INCREASING IN LENGTH AS I BEGAN TO STUDY THEM. I STOPPED GOING TOTHE MOVIES BECAUSE I DIDN’T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH THESE NOCTURNAL SPECTACLES.THE IMAGES GENERATED BY MY UNCONSCIOUS WERE MORE COMPELLING THAN COMMERCIALFARE. SOMETIMES I WOKE UP FOUR TIMES A NIGHT TO SCRAWL THE PLOTS DOWN IN MYJOURNAL BEFORE THE IMAGES FADED AWAY.IN THE MONTHS AFTER MY FATHER’S DEATH, HE APPEARED TO ME IN A SERIES OF DREAMS.SOMETIMES HE HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK BUT SURVIVED, OR HE RETURNED HOME AFTERAN ABSENCE. IN OTHER DREAMS, BOTH HE AND I WERE CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HEWAS STILL ALIVE. HE WAS OFTEN WORRIED ABOUT THE FATE OF HIS PAINTINGS. ONCE WEMET AT AN OLD MIDTOWN BAR AND I SUDDENLY REALIZED WE WERE IN A DREAM. I TOOK THEOPPORTUNITY TO REASSURE HIM THAT I WAS TAKING CARE OF HIS WORK, CATALOGING ANDSTORING IT AS BEST I COULD.IN JANUARY, A FEW WEEKS AFTER I LEARNED THAT MY GIRLFRIEND WAS PREGNANT, I HADTHIS DREAM: MY FATHER AND I WERE SITTING BY A LAKE AND HE SAID, “LOOK AT THE LIGHT.” OUT ONTHE WATER, LIGHT WAS RIPPLING, A GREEN LIGHT BREAKING INTO HALOS AROUND THEROCKS. IT LOOKED LIKE AN EFFECT FROM ONE OF HIS PAINTINGS. I REALIZED I WASBEING ALLOWED TO HAVE A LAST VISIT WITH HIM. I WOKE UP FEELING GRATEFUL, HAPPY TO BE WITH LAURA. THAT WE WERE MAKING A LIFEWITH EACH OTHER, AND A CHILD TOGETHER.NINE MONTHS BEFORE MY FATHER’S DEATH, ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS HAD OVERDOSED ONHEROIN. THIRTY-THREE WHEN HE DIED, R WAS A BRILLIANT WRITER, A MAGNETIC MADMAN,GOOD-LOOKING, STRONG AND STRONG-WILLED, HEIR TO A VAST FAMILY FORTUNE. HISGREAT-GRANDFATHER HAD FOUNDED A SOUTHERN NEWSPAPER DYNASTY. BUT R HAD ANUNHEALTHY FASCINATION WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUGS; HE WAS FIXATED ONSELF-DESTRUCTION. THE GALLEYS OF HIS FIRST NOVEL WERE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE DIED.I NEVER THOUGHT HE WAS AN ADDICT; I THOUGHT HE USED HEROIN AND BOOZE TO ESCAPETHE TERROR THAT WAS CONSUMING HIM. HE FELT, IN SOME WAY, CURSED, FATED TO DIE,AND HE ENACTED HIS HYSTERIC VISION OF HIS FATE. ON THE BLACKBOARD BEHIND HISDESK HE HAD SCRAWLED A LINE FROM ROBERT STONE: “PISSING AND MOANING, MOURNINGAND WEEPING, THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE DRUG.”IN THE MONTHS AFTER R’S DEATH, I HAD A SERIES OF DREAMS ABOUT HIM THAT WERESIMILAR TO THE DREAMS I HAD ABOUT MY FATHER MONTHS LATER. AT FIRST THERE WAS ALOT OF CONFUSION OVER WHETHER OR NOT R WAS REALLY DEAD. I HAD SEVERAL DREAMSWHERE HE OVERDOSED BUT SURVIVED. ONCE, WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS CONFUSION AT A PARTY.ANOTHER TIME I VISITED HIM IN THE HOSPITAL. A FEW TIMES I CRIED TO HIM IN MYDREAMS, SORRY I HADN’T DONE ANYTHING TO HELP HIM. I TOLD HIM I HADN’T KNOWN HOW.WHILE HE WAS ALIVE, I HAD EVEN FANTASIZED ABOUT TAKING HIM TO GABON FOR IBOGA,BUT I KNEW HE WOULDN’T BE OPEN TO IT.ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AFTER R’S DEATH, I HAD A DREAM WHERE I WENT UP INTO “THESPIRIT WORLD,” A KIND OF GRAY LIMBO ACCESSIBLE BY ROPE LADDER, TO VISIT HIM. HESEEMED MUCH CALMER THAN IN OUR EARLIER ENCOUNTERS. HE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF ANOLD TYPEWRITER. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH HIMSELF NOW THAT HE WAS DEAD.“I’M WRITING,” HE SAID. “I’M WRITING ABOUT MY LIFE. I’M TRYING TO UNDERSTANDWHAT HAPPENED.”“THAT’S REALLY GOOD. I’M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT,” I TOLD HIM BEFORE I LEFT.MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT SUCH DREAMS ARE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE PERSONALUNCONSCIOUS. BEFORE MY IBOGAINE TRIP, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT AS WELL. AFTERGABON, I WAS WILLING TO CONSIDER OTHER POSSIBILITIES.AS TIME WENT ON AND I EXAMINED MY DREAMS, I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT THE SPIRITS OFMY FATHER AND MY FRIEND WERE NOT JUST PHANTOMS THAT MY MIND CREATED. THEY WEREVISITORS FROM THE AFTER-DEATH REALM, STILL CONFUSED, SOMETIMES RESENTFUL ABOUTTHEIR LOSS OF HUMAN STATUS. THROUGH THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL SPIRIT WORLD OF DREAMS,THEY WERE ABLE TO REACH ME. MY UNCONSCIOUS PSYCHE (WHAT SOME TRADITIONS CALL THE“ASTRAL BODY”), STILL ATTACHED TO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING, COULD HELP THEMUNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON.COMMUNICATION WITH THE SPIRIT REALM THROUGH DREAMS OR VISIONS IS A COMMONPLACEFACT OF ARCHAIC AND INDIGENOUS CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS ONLY IN THE“RATIONAL” WEST THAT WE REFUTE THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CONTACT—BLOCKED BY OURBLIND FAITH IN MATERIALISM. THE SHAMANS OF THE TARAHUMARA INDIANS TOLD ANTONINARTAUD THAT THE WHITES HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY THE SPIRITS. PERHAPS WE ARE ONLYABANDONED BECAUSE WE PUSH THE SPIRITS AWAY.IN CONTEMPORARY LIFE WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO DENY INTUITION OF THE INVISIBLEREALMS. WE CLOG UP OUR SENSES WITH SMOG, JAM OUR MINDS WITH MEDIA OVERLOAD. WEDROWN OURSELVES IN ALCOHOL OR MEDICATE OURSELVES INTO RIGIDLY ARTIFICIAL STATESWITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS. THEN WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR CYNICISM AND DETACHMENT. PERHAPSWE ARE TERRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT OUR “RATIONALITY” IS ITSELF A KIND OF FAITH,AN ARTIFICE, THAT BENEATH IT LIES THE VAST TERRITORY OF THE UNKNOWN.WHAT IS THE TRUTH OF THE ERA IN WHICH WE LIVE?WALTER BENJAMIN CALLED CAPITALISM “A RELIGION OF DESTRUCTION.” IT IS A RELIGIONBECAUSE IT IS BASED ON FAITH—UNTESTED AND UNPROVEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACOLYTE—INMATERIALISM AND RATIONALISM. IT IS A PASSIVE WORLDVIEW, A NEGATIVE THEOLOGY.EVEN IN THE 1920S, BENJAMIN RECOGNIZED “THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD AS THE REALGOAL OF WORLD CAPITALISM—ITS SYSTEMIC HOPE AND TRANSCENDENT IDEAL.”DISBELIEF IN ANY SPIRITUAL REALITY IS ALSO A BELIEF SYSTEM. THE CAPITALIST MINDPERCEIVES THE WORLD PURELY IN TERMS OF MATERIAL RESOURCES TO BE USED FOR ITSBENEFIT, TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFIT WITHOUT THOUGHT OF LONG-TERMCONSEQUENCE. IF THERE IS STILL A VAGUE AND OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF GUILT, OFWRONGNESS AND IMBALANCE, THIS GNAWING GUILT SPURS CAPITALISM ON TO GREATER ACTSOF CONSUMPTION, MORE VIOLENT ATTEMPTS TO SUBJUGATE NATURE, MORE TOTALIZINGEFFORTS TO CREATE DISTRACTIONS. TO THE “RATIONAL MATERIALIST” MIND, DEATH IS THEEND OF EVERYTHING; THIS THOUGHT FEEDS ITS RAGE AGAINST NATURE, WHICH HAS PLACEDIT IN THIS POSITION OF DESPAIR. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD IS REVENGE AGAINSTA VANISHED GOD, AND A DRASTIC ATTEMPT TO INVOKE THE SPIRITUAL POWERS.BENJAMIN WRITES: CAPITALISM IS PROBABLY THE FIRST INSTANCE OF A CULT THAT CREATES GUILT, NOTATONEMENT. . . . THE NATURE OF THE RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT WHICH IS CAPITALISMENTAILS THE ENDURANCE RIGHT TO THE END, TO THE POINT WHERE GOD, TOO, FINALLYTAKES ON THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF GUILT, TO THE POINT WHERE THE UNIVERSE HAS BEENTAKEN OVER BY THAT DESPAIR WHICH IS ACTUALLY ITS SECRET HOPE. CAPITALISM ISENTIRELY WITHOUT PRECEDENT, IN THAT IT IS A RELIGION WHICH OFFERS NOT THE REFORMOF EXISTENCE BUT ITS COMPLETE DESTRUCTION. IT IS THE EXPANSION OF DESPAIR, UNTILDESPAIR BECOMES A RELIGIOUS STATE OF THE WORLD IN THE HOPE THAT THIS WILL LEADTO SALVATION. IF CAPITALISM IS A RELIGION OF DESTRUCTION—CURRENTLY ACCOMPLISHING ITS GOAL WITHALARMING EFFICIENCY, DESPITE HITTING THE OCCASIONAL RECESSIONAL SPEED BUMP—THENTHE CURRENT DEGRADATION OF THE PLANET MAKES SENSE. THE FLAW IN OUR THINKING ISSYSTEMIC. OUTSIDE OF A TRAUMATIC TRANSFORMATION OF VALUES, THERE IS NO WAY TOSTOP AN ASSAULT BASED ON A DEEPLY UNCONSCIOUS, EVEN METAPHYSICAL, YEARNING FORVENGEANCE.PERHAPS IT IS ONLY THROUGH PARSING OUT THE METAPHYSICAL RATIONALE HIDDEN WITHINTHE MODERN MYTH OF “RATIONALITY” THAT WE CAN GRASP WHY THERE IS NO COHERENTATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE CATASTROPHIC PROCESSES WE HAVE SET IN MOTION. THESEPROCESSES—GLOBAL WARMING, THE PUNCTURING OF THE OZONE LAYER, THE DISRUPTION OFTHE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM, NUCLEAR WASTE THAT REMAINS RADIOACTIVE FOR TENS OFTHOUSANDS OF YEARS, THE RISKY BIOENGINEERING OF NEW ORGANISMS AND VIRUSES, THESHORT-TERM GREED AND MONOTONOUS MORAL BLINDNESS—INCREASINGLY THREATEN THE VERYFABRIC OF OUR BEING. THE INDIVIDUAL IS INTUITIVELY AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OFTHESE THREATS. OUR INTUITION IS DENIED BY OUR LEADERS AND TECHNOCRATS, PUPPETSFOR THE CORPORATE INTERESTS. THEY HAVE NO VISION FOR THE FUTURE.BENJAMIN’S DEFINITION OF CAPITALISM CLARIFIED THE MEANING OF HEROIN IN THE LIVESOF R AND OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW, THE FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WHO DIED FROMOVERDOSES AS WELL AS THOSE WHO RUINED THEIR LIVES THROUGH ADDICTION. HEROINSUFFUSES THE BODY WITH PLEASURE AND TEMPORARILY NULLIFIES THE MIND. IT IS ANENJOYABLE HIGH BUT NOT MUCH MORE—EVEN THAT ENJOYMENT IS TEMPERED BY GRIMNESS, BYTHE PSYCHIC VACUITY THE DRUG CREATES. IT IS TRUE THAT HEROIN IS PHYSICALLYADDICTIVE, BUT ACCORDING TO TREATMENT COUNSELORS THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OFBREAKING THAT ADDICTION ARE ABOUT EQUAL TO A THREE-DAY FLU. THE SYNTHETICNARCOTIC METHADONE THAT THE GOVERNMENT GIVES TO HEROIN ADDICTS IS, ALARMINGLY,FAR MORE ADDICTIVE THAN HEROIN. IN FACT, IT WAS CREATED BY THE NAZIS AS A TOOLOF SOCIAL CONTROL.HEROIN ADDICTION, OR OVERDOSE, IS OFTEN A RESPONSE TO AN INEXPRESSIBLE SPIRITUALEMERGENCY. MY FRIEND R, AS WELL AS OTHER FRIENDS WHO DIED FROM HEROIN, SUFFEREDFROM A SPIRITUAL CRISIS, A MORAL ABYSS. R TURNED TO HEROIN BECAUSE IT WAS A WAYOUT, A SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE LABYRINTH CREATED BY HISWEALTH, HIS TERROR, AND HIS DESPERATION. IT WAS A CAPITULATION TO THE IDEOLOGYOF DESTRUCTION. LIKE ME, HE HAD NO ACCESS TO ANY KIND OF FAITH. HE HAD NO MEANSOF EXPRESSING A TRANSCENDENTAL IMPULSE—EXCEPT SELF-OBLITERATION. LIKE MANY USERSOF THE DRUG, INSPIRED BY THE NIHILIST BACKGROUND NOISE OF OUR CULTURE, HEROMANTICIZED THE AGENT OF HIS DOOM."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15THE TEMPLE OF TEARS[images/00006.jpg] THE BEST SCULPTURE AT BURNING MAN 2001, ONE OF THE BESTWORKS OF CONTEMPORARY ART I HAVE EVER SEEN, WAS THE “TEMPLE OF TEARS,” PERHAPSSIX STORIES HIGH AND ENTIRELY CONSTRUCTED FROM CARVED WOODEN PIECES. THETEMPLE’S INTRICATE SPIRES RESEMBLED SACRED HINDU SANCTUARIES I ONCE VISITED INNEPAL. THE WOODEN PANELS USED IN ITS CONSTRUCTION WERE THE CUTOUT MOLDS FROM AFACTORY THAT MADE DINOSAUR MODELS FOR CHILDREN. REQUIRING PAINSTAKING MONTHS OFLABOR, THE TEMPLE WAS BUILT IN MEMORY OF A FRIEND OF THE ARTIST WHO HAD KILLEDHIMSELF. IT WAS A COMMEMORATIVE SHRINE OPEN TO ALL TO REMEMBER THE DEAD. OVERTHE WEEK, THE WALLS WERE ENTIRELY COVERED WITH SCRAWLED NAMES AND REMEMBRANCES.SOME PEOPLE CREATED ENTIRE SHRINES—WITH PHOTOS, MEMENTOES, LONG LETTERS—FORTHOSE THEY HAD LOST. WHENEVER I ENTERED THE SPACE, DAY OR NIGHT, IT WAS FULL OFPEOPLE OF ALL AGES, MANY WEEPING QUIETLY, PRAYING, BURNING INCENSE, REMEMBERING.BHUTTO DANCERS MADE SILENT PERFORMANCES, CRAWLING ALONG THE GROUND OUTSIDE OFTHE ENTRANCE. I ADDED THE NAMES OF MY FATHER AND R TO THE WALLS.ON SUNDAY NIGHT, THE LAST OF THE FESTIVAL, THE TEMPLE WAS TORCHED. ON THE WAY TOIT, I GOT LOST IN A DUST STORM WITH THREE STRANGERS. FOR WHAT SEEMED A VERY LONGTIME, WE WANDERED ACROSS THE PLAYA, OUR WAY ILLUMINATED ONLY BY THE FULL MOON, AWHITE GLOWING ORB OVERHEAD, MAGNETIZING THE EARTH. WE WERE SURROUNDED BYGRAYNESS, BY DEEP NOTHING. A SPARKLING ROCKET EXPLODED IN SHOWERING WHITESPARKS. IN THE DISTANCE, WE SAW THREE RED TAILLIGHTS DEFINE A VEHICLE AS PUREGEOMETRIC FORM. THE THREE STRANGERS SEEMED TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL. I THINK THEYCAME FROM SOME HIPPIE PARADISE HIDDEN IN THE BACKWOODS OF OREGON. IGNORING ME,THEY WERE CONTINUING AN OLD CONVERSATION. WITH LITTLE CONTEXT, I UNDERSTOOD ITWAS ABOUT THE OVERALL SENSE OF LIFE, ITS POETRY AND PORNOGRAPHY AND POISON,REFRACTED IN THAT BECKETT-LIKE MOMENT.ONE OF THEM SAID TO THE OTHERS, “HERE’S AN IDEA FOR YOU: WHAT IF IT’S ALWAYSBEEN EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS NOW?”I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HE MEANT, BUT I LOST THEM BEFORE I COULD ASK. I FOUND MYWAY TO THE CROWD. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE MASSED IN A HUGE CIRCLE AROUND THETEMPLE. THERE WAS HALF AN HOUR OF HUSHED SILENCE BEFORE THE STRUCTURE WASTORCHED, BURNING MAJESTICALLY, GIANT FLAMES SINKING DOWN TO GOLD EMBERS, WOODENORNAMENTS SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT LIKE GHOST FACES BEFORE CRACKLING INTO ASH ANDSOOT AND GRAY SMOKE.THE TEMPLE REVEALED THE FESTIVAL’S HIDDEN UNDERCURRENT OF SADNESS, OF MOURNING.DISGUISED BY ITS RIDICULOUS EXCESSES, PUBLIC ORGIES, ART CAR RALLIES, ANDALL-NIGHT RAVES, BURNING MAN ALSO HAS A SORROWING STREAK. AS THEY DANCE, THEREVELERS ALSO GRIEVE (OR IS IT ONLY A PROJECTION OF MY OWN GLOOMY NATURE?) FOREVERYTHING SPIRITLESS AND VACANT—THE HIDEOUS MEDUSA MASK OF OUR CULTURE—THATNEEDS TO BE TORN OFF AND FED TO THE FLAMES. SOMETIMES I ALSO INTUIT, IN THEMIDST OF THAT MASKED AND MANIC CARNIVAL, REVERBERATED BY TECHNO BEATS, A KIND OFAMBIVALENCE OVER THE HUMAN STATE; A SENSE OF INSUFFICIENCY, A YEARNING FORTRANSCENDENCE.THE GREATEST PARTY IN THE WORLD IS ALSO A WAKE FOR THIS WORLD.. . .THE NEXT MORNING I WOKE UP AT DAWN AND STEPPED OUT OF MY TENT. I LOOKED TO ONESIDE OF THE DESERT, AND ONE HALF OF THE FULL MOON WAS STILL VISIBLE AS ITPLUNGED OUT OF SIGHT, BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS, OVER THE GRAY FLATLAND. TURNINGAROUND, I SAW EXACTLY ONE-HALF OF THE RED-TINGED FIREBALL OF THE SUN RISING UP,180 DEGREES OPPOSITE, OVER THE PLAYA. SUN, MOON, AND EARTH WERE LIKE THREESPINNING GYRES IN A COSMIC MECHANISM.AT BURNING MAN, I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE IDEAS OF GEORGES IVANOVITCH GURDJIEFF, AMYSTERIOUS OCCULTIST FROM THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, BY SOMEONE IMET AT THE CAFE—IT WAS MY HABIT, IN THAT SUPERCHARGED NOW-HERE, TO SEEK OUTDAILY CONVERSATIONS WITH STRANGERS. IN THIS WAY, I LEARNED MANY THINGS I HADN’TKNOWN BEFORE.ORIGINALLY FROM THE CAUCASUS, GURDJIEFF FOUNDED A SCHOOL NEAR PARIS, WHERE HEDIED IN 1949. IN GURDJIEFF’S SYSTEM, STUDENTS PERFORM MOVEMENTS AND DANCES IN ASTATE OF HEIGHTENED SELF-AWARENESS. AT HIS SCHOOL, HE USED RITUALIZED GESTURESTO BREAK APART DEAD HABITS—OLD POSTURES, MOTH-EATEN IDEAS—AND RELEASE NEWFORCES. SOME INTELLECTUAL DEFENDERS OF THE RAVE MOVEMENT HAVE ADOPTEDGURDJIEFF’S SYSTEM AS A WAY OF EXPLAINING THE INNATE MYSTICAL RAPPORT RAVERSFEEL WHILE DANCING. GURDJIEFF THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF HUMAN EXISTENCE IS TOTRANSFORM AND TRANSMIT CERTAIN COSMIC ENERGIES. CLEARLY, THE ALL-NIGHTEXUBERANCE OF BURNING MAN, ITS PLAYING WITH THE ELEMENTS OF HEAT AND LIGHT—FIRE,LASER, AND LIGHTNING—IS AN ATTEMPT, IN BENJAMIN’S PHRASE, TO “COMMINGLE WITH THECOSMIC POWERS.”GURDJIEFF HAD MANY VISIONARY IDEAS THAT SEEM QUITE STRANGE. HE BELIEVED THAT ASOUL WAS NOT SOMETHING YOU SIMPLY HAD BUT SOMETHING YOU HAD TO WORK TO ACQUIRE.HE CALLED THIS WORK “INTENTIONAL SUFFERING” AND “CONSCIOUS LABOR.” HE BELIEVEDTHE EARTH AND THE MOON WERE LIVING, EVOLVING BEINGS—ALSO A SHAMANIC CONCEPT—ANDTHAT HUMANITY WAS DESIGNED TO SERVE THE EVOLUTIONARY PURPOSES OF THE EARTH ANDTHE MOON. HUMAN BEINGS ARE, IN HIS THEORY, THE “ORGANS OF SENSE PERCEPTION” FORTHE EARTH, AND IN THEIR CONTINUAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF THIS PLANET THEY SERVE THEPLANET’S NEEDS, NOT THEIR OWN. “HUMANITY, LIKE THE REST OF ORGANIC LIFE, EXISTSON EARTH FOR THE NEEDS AND PURPOSES OF THE EARTH. AND IT IS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULDBE FOR THE EARTH’S REQUIREMENTS AT THE PRESENT TIME.”IN HIS SYSTEM, THERE ARE MANY FINER GRADIENTS OF MATTER THAT SCIENCE DOES NOTREGISTER—NOT ONLY IDEAS AND THOUGHTS BUT EVEN A SUBSTRATE OF THE HUMAN SPIRITARE TYPES OF MATERIAL. AFTER WE DIE, ACCORDING TO GURDJIEFF, THE MOON CONSUMESTHE FINE MATTER OF HUMAN SPIRITS. IT IS LIKE A MAGNET THAT DRAWS OUR PSYCHICCORPSES INTO IT: “EVERYTHING LIVING ON THE EARTH, PEOPLE, ANIMALS, PLANTS, ISFOOD FOR THE MOON. THE MOON IS A HUGE LIVING BEING FEEDING UPON ALL THAT LIVESAND GROWS ON THE EARTH.” SOMEDAY THE EARTH WOULD EVOLVE INTO A BEING LIKE THESUN, WHILE THE MOON WOULD TRANSFORM INTO A SECOND EARTH. HUMANITY WAS SIMPLY ASTAGE IN THIS PROCESS.ONLY THROUGH AN INTENSIVE EFFORT OF CONSCIOUS EVOLUTION—WHAT HE CALLED“SELF-REMEMBERING”—IS IT POSSIBLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO ESCAPE BEING EATEN BY THEMOON. “THE LIBERATION THAT COMES WITH THE GROWTH OF MENTAL POWERS AND FACULTIESIS LIBERATION FROM THE MOON.” HE ARGUED THAT HUMANITY WAS NOT TRULY CONSCIOUS,THAT MAN’S ACTIONS WERE ENTIRELY MECHANICAL: “EVERYTHING ‘HAPPENS,’ HE CANNOT‘DO’ ANYTHING. HE IS A MACHINE CONTROLLED BY ACCIDENTAL SHOCKS FROM OUTSIDE.”THE INFLUENCES OF THE OTHER PLANETS DETERMINE WARS, REVOLUTIONS, TECHNOLOGICALBREAKTHROUGHS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHES ON THE EARTH’S SURFACE. THE RAPIDPROLIFERATION OF CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD BE A WAY FOR THE EARTHTO CHANGE ITS ELECTROMAGNETIC SHEATH. IN HIS SYSTEM, PROGRESS IS AN ILLUSION FORMOST OF HUMANITY: “EVERYTHING IS JUST THE SAME AS IT WAS THOUSANDS, AND TENS OFTHOUSANDS, OF YEARS AGO.”MOST OF MY LIFE, I HAVE BEEN CHAINED TO CITIES WHERE NIGHT IS, FOR THE MOSTPART, A MUTED VOID AND THE ELEMENTS ARE REDUCED TO ABSTRACTIONS. ON THE OTHERHAND, IN MANHATTAN, IT IS VERY EASY TO HAVE THE UNEASY AWARENESS OF BEING AMINISCULE COG IN A VAST MACHINE, A “CYBERNETIC PULSE ENGINE,” ACCELERATINGOUTSIDE OF HUMAN CONTROL. THINKING ABOUT GURDJIEFF IN THE BLACK ROCK DESERT, ITWAS AMUSING TO SUSPECT THAT THE COSMIC APPARATUS OF SWIRLING CONSTELLATIONS ANDPLANETARY BODIES AND RADIATING MOON MIGHT EXERT A DIRECT AND CAUSAL INFLUENCE ONHUMAN DESTINY, THAT THOSE FORCES MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RUNNING OF THEENTIRE MECHANISM. IN A SENSE, IT SEEMED A STRICTLY LOGICAL IDEA.I RETURNED TO NEW YORK CITY. TEN DAYS AFTER THE SPECTACULAR BURNING OF THE“TEMPLE OF TEARS,” LAURA AND I WERE CARING FOR OUR THREE-WEEK-OLD BABY WHEN WEHEARD THE LOUD THRUST OF A LOW-FLYING AIRPLANE AND THEN A SICKENING THUD. WEOPENED THE BLINDS TO SEE ONE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TOWERS IN FLAMES, A BLACKCRATER IN ITS SIDE. BY THE TIME THE FIRST TOWER FELL, DAZED CROWDS WERESTREAMING UPTOWN BELOW OUR WINDOW. BEFORE THE SECOND TOWER COLLAPSED, I WENT OUTAND WALKED SOUTH TOWARD THE CATASTROPHE, PASSING CROWDS OF FRIGHTENED WALLSTREET FINANCIERS AND SECRETARIES, SHELL-SHOCKED COLLEGE STUDENTS, STUNNEDJANITORS. SOME WERE COVERED IN SOOT. MANY WERE BABBLING ON THEIR CELL PHONES.OUTSIDE THE COURT BUILDINGS, NEWSCASTERS BROADCAST EMERGENCY UPDATES. POLICEMENTRIED TO CONTROL THE CROWDS.AS I WATCHED THE CHAOS, GURDJIEFF’S POETIC VISIONS RAN THROUGH MY MIND. “WHAT ISWAR? IT IS THE RESULT OF PLANETARY INFLUENCES,” HE SAID. “EVERYTHING THATHAPPENS ON A BIG SCALE IS GOVERNED FROM OUTSIDE, AND GOVERNED EITHER BYACCIDENTAL COMBINATIONS OF INFLUENCES OR BY GENERAL COSMIC LAWS.”IT WAS PAST ELEVEN A.M. UP IN THE BLUE SKY, BETWEEN TWO TOWERS, A TWO-THIRDSWEDGE OF LUNAR OPAL WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE, BEAMING OVER THE CITY. I WAS SURPRISEDBY ITS BRIGHTNESS SO LATE IN THE DAY.SUDDENLY, I REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING, IF GURDJIEFF WAS RIGHT:THE MOON WAS FEEDING."},{"pageContent":"[images/00009.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16WALKING IN MYSTERIES[images/00006.jpg] WHAT IF THE ORIGIN OF CULTURE, WHAT CARLO GINZBURG CALLED“THE MATRIX OF ALL POSSIBLE NARRATIVES,” WAS THE SHAMANIC JOURNEY? THEN ART ANDLITERATURE, DANCE AND THEATER WOULD BE ELABORATED OR DEGRADED FORMS OF THEORIGINAL IMPULSE TO REACH THE “OTHER WORLDS” THROUGH TRANCE AND RITUAL.PERHAPS MODERN CULTURE AND FAITH-BASED RELIGION IS A SHORT-TERM EXPERIMENTWITHIN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF SHAMANISM AND ITS UNTOLD MILLENNIA OF CONTINUITY:AN EXPERIMENT IN TURNING AWAY FROM ACTUAL VISIONARY KNOWLEDGE IN FAVOR OFCATHARTIC SPECTACLES, SYMBOLIC CODES, AND THE MIMETIC TECHNIQUES OF LITERATUREAND FILM; IN SUBSTITUTING PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SACRED REALITIES WITH FAITH, ANDFINALLY, IN THE SECULARIZED WEST, EXTINGUISHING FAITH ENTIRELY IN FAVOR OFNONBELIEF IN ANY SPIRITUAL DIMENSION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE.THE “REDISCOVERY” OF SHAMANISM IS NOT JUST A NEW AGE PHENOMENON. THE WESTERNWORLD HAS MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND SHAMANISM, OFTEN SEEKING TOREDUCE IT TO SIMPLE QUACKERY. THE PROCESS OF FORGETTING AND REDISCOVERING,REEVALUATING AND DISMISSING, SHAMANISM HAS CONTINUED FOR CENTURIES. FROM THESIXTEENTH THROUGH THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, EXPLORERS IN SIBERIA AND THE NEW WORLDWROTE REPORTS OF JUGGLERS, CONJURERS, AND TRIBAL SORCERERS THAT WERE AVIDLYSTUDIED BY THE INTELLIGENTSIA OF EUROPE. THE TONE OF THESE ACCOUNTS RANGED FROMSNEERING ATTACKS ON FRAUDULENT PRACTICES AND SHRILL DENUNCIATIONS OF DEVILWORSHIPING, TO OBJECTIVE AND EVEN COMPASSIONATE STUDIES OF SHAMANIC HEALINGPRACTICES.“WHILE SOME EUROPEANS CONTINUED TO RIDICULE WHAT THEY CONSIDERED PUBLIC TRICKERYAND IGNOBLE CREDULITY, OTHERS BEGAN TAKING SHAMANISTIC PRACTICES VERYSERIOUSLY,” WRITES THE HISTORIAN GLORIA FLAHERTY IN HER BOOK SHAMANISM AND THEEIGHTEENTH CENTURY. “SHAMANISM SEEMED TO THEM TO EPITOMIZE A GRAND CONFLUENCE OFAGELESS HUMAN ACTIVITIES THE WORLD OVER.” FLAHERTY SUGGESTS THE EVOLVING CULT OFTHE GENIUS, THE MAGIC POWERS OF ENCHANTMENT ATTRIBUTED TO MOZART OR GOETHE,AROSE OUT OF EUROPE’S FASCINATION WITH SHAMANS.THE ARCHETYPAL FIGURE OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT, GOETHE AMASSEDINFORMATION ON MAGIC AND GHOSTS, REJECTED NEWTON’S MECHANISTIC VIEW OF NATURE,BELIEVING THAT NATURE WAS ANIMATED BY SPIRITUAL FORCES. “WE ALL WALK INMYSTERIES,” THE POET AND SCIENTIST WROTE TO A FRIEND. “WE ARE SURROUNDED BY ANATMOSPHERE ABOUT WHICH WE STILL KNOW NOTHING AT ALL. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT STIRSIN IT AND HOW IT IS CONNECTED WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE. THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN, UNDERPARTICULAR CONDITIONS THE ANTENNAE OF OUR SOULS ARE ABLE TO REACH OUT BEYONDTHEIR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS.” GOETHE INCORPORATED MANY ASPECTS OF THE SHAMANARCHETYPE—CONTACT WITH GHOSTS DURING WALPURGISNACHT, DRUG-INDUCED TRANCE,JOURNEYS INTO THE WORLD OF THE DEAD, ETCETERA—INTO THE FIGURE OF FAUST, THEMODERN MAGICIAN.IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, ROMANTIC POETS LIKE SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, EDGARALLAN POE, AND PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY OBSESSIVELY EXPLORED THEIR DREAMS AS ABRIDGE BETWEEN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUS MIND. “I SHOULD MUCH WISH, LIKE THEINDIAN VISHNU, TO FLOAT ABOUT ALONG AN INFINITE OCEAN CRADLED IN THE FLOWER OFTHE LOTOS, AND WAKE ONCE IN A MILLION YEARS FOR A FEW MINUTES—JUST TO KNOW I WASGOING TO SLEEP A MILLION YEARS MORE,” WROTE COLERIDGE, WHOSE MOST FAMOUS POEM,“KUBLA KHAN,” WAS RECONSTRUCTED FROM AN OPIUM REVERY.LIKE SHAMANS, THE ROMANTIC POETS WERE PRACTICAL TECHNICIANS WHO INVESTIGATEDTHEIR OWN DREAMS AND TRANCE STATES, USING DRUGS AMONG OTHER METHODS TO PROBE THEFAR REACHES OF THE MIND. THEY TRAINED THEMSELVES TO PRODUCE HYPNAGOGICIMAGERY—THE SEMI-CONTROLLABLE HALLUCINATIONS THAT CAN RISE UP JUST AT THE EDGEOF SLEEP. THOMAS DE QUINCEY, WHO FOUNDED THE MODERN GENRE OF DRUG TESTIMONY WITHCONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM-EATER, DESCRIBED THESE VISIONS AS “HERALDRIESPAINTED ON DARKNESS.” THE DREAM LYRICISM OF THE ROMANTICS WAS AN ACT OFRESISTANCE TO RATIONAL EMPIRICISM AND THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.WHILE THE ROMANTICS SOUGHT TO LINGER IN THEIR DREAMWORLDS, THE MODERNISTSEXPLORED THE MOMENT OF AWAKENING AS THE MODEL FOR A NEW TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESSTHAT COULD FUSE RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL PROCESSES. FOR WRITERS LIKE MARCELPROUST, JAMES JOYCE, AND VIRGINIA WOOLF, THE EFFORT MADE BY THE SLEEPER TO AWAKEFROM THE DREAM SERVED AS A METAPHOR FOR THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVESCIENTIFIC AND SOCIAL THOUGHT OF THEIR ERA, AND THE PRIMORDIAL, RITUALISTICSLAUGHTER OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR. “HISTORY IS A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH I AM TRYINGTO AWAKE,” ANNOUNCES STEPHEN DAEDALUS, NEAR THE BEGINNING OF ULYSSES, A BOOKTHAT INCLUDES A ONE-HUNDRED-PAGE PLAY THAT TAKES PLACE IN “NIGHT TOWN,” ATRANSCRIPT OF A SEMI-COHERENT NIGHTMARE OR GHOST TRIP THAT READS LIKE IT WASDREAMT BY THE BOOK ITSELF.IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME BEGINS WITH MARCEL PROUST’S PROTAGONIST LYING IN HIS BED,SORTING HIMSELF OUT FROM CONFUSED AND VIVID DREAMS OF THE PAST. PROUST’S OPENINGREVEALS THE MOMENT OF WAKING UP AS A MYSTICAL TRANSGRESSION BETWEEN THE SELF ANDTHE NOT-SELF: . . . WHEN I AWOKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, NOT KNOWING WHERE I WAS, I COULDNOT EVEN BE SURE AT FIRST WHO I WAS; I HAD ONLY THE MOST RUDIMENTARY SENSE OFEXISTENCE, SUCH AS MAY LURK AND FLICKER IN THE DEPTHS OF AN ANIMAL’SCONSCIOUSNESS; I WAS MORE DESTITUTE THAN THE CAVE-DWELLER; BUT THEN THEMEMORY—NOT YET OF THE PLACE WHERE I WAS, BUT OF VARIOUS OTHER PLACES WHERE I HADLIVED AND MIGHT NOW VERY POSSIBLY BE—WOULD COME LIKE A ROPE LET DOWN FROM HEAVENTO DRAW ME UP OUT OF THE ABYSS OF NOT-BEING, FROM WHICH I NEVER COULD HAVEESCAPED BY MYSELF: IN A FLASH I WOULD TRAVERSE CENTURIES OF CIVILIZATION, ANDOUT OF A BLURRED GLIMPSE OF OIL-LAMPS, THEN OF SHIRTS WITH TURNED-DOWN COLLARS,WOULD GRADUALLY PIECE TOGETHER THE ORIGINAL COMPONENTS OF MY EGO. EACH NIGHT, PROUST’S NARRATOR JOURNEYS FROM PSYCHIC DISSOLUTION TOSELF-POSSESSION, FROM DISMEMBERMENT TO REMEMBRANCE. THE IMAGE OF A “ROPE LETDOWN FROM HEAVEN” IS AKIN TO THE SHAMANIC MOTIF OF A LADDER FROM THE SKY,LEADING BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE OTHER REALMS. THE VAST UNDERSEA KINGDOM OFSLEEP CALLED INTO QUESTION THE SOLIDITY OF THE WAKING REALITY: “PERHAPS THEIMMOBILITY OF THE THINGS THAT SURROUND US IS FORCED UPON THEM BY OUR CONVICTIONTHAT THEY ARE THEMSELVES AND NOT ANYTHING ELSE, BY THE IMMOBILITY OF OURCONCEPTION OF THEM.” THE SICKNESS THAT EXILED PROUST TO A CORK-LINED ROOM, OUTOF CONTACT WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS, IN A KIND OF LIVING AFTERLIFE, WAS LIKE THESHAMAN’S INITIATORY SICKNESS AND NERVOUS DISORDER, HIS CELIBACY AND HISCOMPULSION TO SEPARATE FROM HIS TRIBE WHILE EXPLORING THE SPIRIT REALMS.THE MODERNIST WRITERS AND ARTISTS, CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT, BORROWED ELEMENTS FROMTHE SHAMANIC ARCHETYPE. LIKE TRIBAL SHAMANS, THE ARTISTS SAW THEMSELVES, IN EZRAPOUND’S PHRASE, AS “THE ANTENNAE OF THE RACE.” IN A SECULAR CULTURE, THEY WERETHE ONES WHO JOURNEYED INTO THE LAND OF THE DEAD, WHO CRAFTED IMAGES OF ANELUSIVE SUBLIME, WHO WENT INTO ECSTATIC STATES OF INSPIRATION. THEY BELIEVEDTHEIR ICONS AND TESTAMENTS, LIKE MAGIC FETISHES, CONTAINED THE POWER TO HEAL THECULTURE’S SPIRITUAL MALADIES. WRITERS LIKE GERTRUDE STEIN, TRISTAN TZARA, ORJAMES JOYCE EXPLORED PRIVATE LANGUAGES OR LANGUAGES EXPLICITLY MADE OUT OFNONSENSE—SIMILAR TO THE SHAMAN’S COMMON PRACTICE OF GLOSSOLALIA, SPEAKING INTONGUES, DURING TRANCE. THE SHAMAN’S SONGS WERE TAUGHT TO HIM BY THE SPIRITS;THE CHANTS OF THE MODERNIST POET WERE EXPRESSIONS OF ALIENATION FROM ADEHUMANIZED AND DEMYSTIFIED WORLD."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17I AM NOT HERE[images/00006.jpg] IN THE LAST CENTURIES OF CAPITALISM, INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS ANDRATIONALISM WERE MIRRORED BY A CULTURAL HISTORY OF FRANTIC VISIONS, SYMBOLICEXCURSIONS, AND NARCOTIC ESCAPES. ARTISTS AND INTELLECTUALS SEARCHED FORANTIDOTES TO THE SUFFOCATING MATERIALISM OF THE WEST. THE EXPLORATION OFCHEMICALLY INDUCED ALTERED STATES WAS ONE EXTREME LIMIT, ONE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT,OF THE MODERNIST QUEST. THE POET ARTHUR RIMBAUD CALLED FOR “A SYSTEMATICDERANGEMENT OF THE SENSES,” AND IN THE 1920S THE SURREALISTS, FOLLOWING HISLEAD, FOUND INSPIRATION IN PSYCHIC DISORDER AND EXTRAVAGANT SHOCK EFFECTS.WRITING ON THE SURREALISTS, THE CRITIC WALTER BENJAMIN NOTED:“IN THE WORLD’S STRUCTURE, DREAM LOOSENS INDIVIDUALITY LIKE A BAD TOOTH. THISLOOSENING OF THE SELF BY INTOXICATION IS, AT THE SAME TIME, PRECISELY THEFRUITFUL, LIVING EXPERIENCE THAT ALLOWED THESE PEOPLE TO STEP OUTSIDE THE DOMAINOF INTOXICATION.” ALTERED STATES ALLOWED THINKERS TO ESCAPE, TEMPORARILY, FROMTHE OVERWHELMING, AND INTOXICATING, DREAMWORLD OF CAPITALISM.MODERNIST ARTISTS PURSUED THE DEVIANT AND DISGRACED, SOUGHT OUT WHAT HAD BEENREFUSED, TOSSED ASIDE, MADE ALIEN BY THE WEST. THE RESURGENCE OF INTEREST IN THESACRED TRIBAL MEDICINES, WHICH BEGAN WITH A FEW DEDICATED AND OFTEN DESPERATESEEKERS, OPENED A NEW PHASE OF THE MODERNIST EXPLORATION OF CULTURAL OTHERNESS:AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE VISIONARY KNOWLEDGE OF “PRIMITIVE”SOCIETIES.THE WRITERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO FIRST TOOK THE PSYCHEDELIC VOYAGEOUT—ANTONIN ARTAUD, HENRI MICHAUX, ALDOUS HUXLEY, AND WILLIAM BURROUGHS AMONGTHEM—FOUND THAT THE TRIBAL SACRAMENTS, OFF-LIMITS AND LITTLE KNOWN IN THE WESTFOR MANY CENTURIES, HAD A SPLIT IDENTITY. ON THE ONE HAND, THE SUBSTANCES OPENEDVAST DOMAINS OF PERCEPTUAL AWARENESS, SPARKED NEW IDEAS, AND UNLEASHED VISIONSTHAT SEEMED TO UNFOLD FROM THE JUNGIAN COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS, OR FROM THE MINDOF A SUPERNATURAL TRICKSTER. BUT THE EXPERIENCE WAS ALSO ONE OF ABJECTION ANDANXIETY AND HELPLESSNESS.ARTAUD TRAVELED TO MEXICO IN 1936 TO TAKE PART IN THE PEYOTE RITUALS OF THETARAHUMARA INDIANS, A REMOTE MOUNTAIN TRIBE LIVING ON BARREN PEAKS A FEW DAYS’JOURNEY FROM MEXICO CITY. THE TORMENTED POET WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS OF THETARAHUMARA OUT OF DESPERATION. HE YEARNED TO RECOVER “THAT SENSE OF THE SACREDWHICH EUROPEAN CONSCIOUSNESS HAS LOST . . . THE ROOT OF ALL OUR MISFORTUNES.”ARTAUD SUFFERED INTERNAL EXILE FROM HIS OWN MIND, HIS OWN THOUGHTS, “AFUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN MY PSYCHE.” IN HIS WRITINGS, HE RETURNED, OVER AND OVER, TOTHIS INNER SEPARATION, FELT AS TERROR, AS RUPTURE, AS YEARNING FOR CONNECTION TOSOME REALITY.“I AM NOT HERE,” HE WROTE TO A FRIEND. “I AM NOT HERE, AND I NEVER WILL BE.”POET, ACTOR, FOUNDER OF THE THEATER OF CRUELTY, INSPIRATION FOR GENERATIONS OFEMBARRASSING PSEUDOTRANSGRESSIVE SPECTACLES PERFORMED IN LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGESAND FRINGE THEATERS AROUND THE WORLD, HE HAS A DESERVED REPUTATION AS A RADICALAND HISTRIONIC FIGURE WHO ONCE DECLARED, “ALL LITERATURE IS PIGSHIT.” SOME OFARTAUD’S WRITING IS MAD RAVINGS AND SOME IS EXTREMELY TOUGH GOING, BUT HE WASALSO CAPABLE OF GREAT LUCIDITY. SEEKING CLUES TO HIS CONDITION, HE PROBED AMONGMYSTICAL TRADITIONS, ALCHEMICAL PROCESSES, THE FRAGMENTARY SHARDS GLEANED FROMHIS OWN INNER WORLD: “THERE IS A SECRET DETERMINISM BASED ON THE HIGHER LAWS OFTHE WORLD; BUT IN AN AGE OF A MECHANIZED SCIENCE LOST AMONG THE MICROSCOPES, TOSPEAK OF THE HIGHER LAWS OF THE WORLD IS TO AROUSE THE DERISION OF A WORLD INWHICH LIFE HAS BECOME A MUSEUM.” HIS LIFE WAS A QUEST FOR THOSE HIGHER LAWS.FOR A TIME, ARTAUD BELONGED TO THE DOCTRINAIRE SURREALIST PARTY: “SURREALISM HASNEVER MEANT ANYTHING TO ME BUT A NEW KIND OF MAGIC. THE BEYOND, THE INVISIBLE,REPLACES REALITY. THE WORLD NO LONGER HOLDS.” SURREALISM WAS, FOR ARTAUD, ASYSTEM OF TECHNIQUES FOR EXPLORING IRRATIONAL, MYSTICAL, AND DISSOCIATIVESTATES—THOSE DOMAINS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT A MATERIALIST CULTURE DISCARDS ASUSELESS. SURREALISM SHOWED HOW, “OUT OF THE RIGHT USE OF DREAMS COULD BE BORN ANEW WAY OF GUIDING ONE’S THOUGHT, A NEW WAY OF RELATING TO APPEARANCES.”HE SPLIT THE SURREALISTS WHEN THEY TURNED TO COMMUNISM. FOR ARTAUD, THE FACTTHAT THE SURREALISTS JOINED THE COMMUNISTS ONLY PROVED THAT THEIR REVOLUTIONARYIMPULSE HAD NOT PENETRATED DEEPLY ENOUGH. “THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES OF ANYMOVEMENT ARE THOSE CAPABLE OF SHIFTING THE PRESENT FOUNDATION OF THINGS, OFCHANGING THE ANGLE OF REALITY.” COMMUNISM WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE BECAUSE ITDIDN’T RECOGNIZE, DIDN’T TRANSFORM, “THE INTERNAL WORLD OF THOUGHT.”TO REACH THE TARAHUMARA, ARTAUD PASSED THROUGH A PRIMORDIAL LANDSCAPE INSCRIBEDWITH SYMBOLS, NUMBERS, AND IMAGES—BLASTED TREES LIKE CRUCIFIED MEN, DEMONICFACES PEEKING FROM ROCKS. LATER HE SAW THE SHAMANS OF THE TARAHUMARA WEAVE THESESYMBOLS INTO A LIVING COSMOLOGY THAT EXPRESSED THE ESSENCE OF THEIR MYSTICALSCIENCE. “THIS DARK REASSIMILATION IS CONTAINED WITHIN CIGURI (PEYOTE), AS AMYTH OF REAWAKENING, THEN OF DESTRUCTION, AND FINALLY OF RESOLUTION IN THE SIEVEOF SUPREME SURRENDER, AS THEIR PRIESTS ARE INCESSANTLY SHOUTING AND AFFIRMING INTHEIR DANCE OF ALL OF THE NIGHT.” LIKE THE BWITI, THE TARAHUMARA HAD A SYMBIOSISWITH THEIR MAGICAL ROOT. WHEN THE SHAMANS DANCED, ARTAUD REALIZED, “THEY DO WHATTHE PLANT TELLS THEM TO DO; THEY REPEAT IT LIKE A KIND OF LESSON WHICH THEIRMUSCLES OBEY.”EUROPEAN MODERNISTS LIKE PABLO PICASSO AND ANDRÉ DERAIN WERE FASCINATED BY“PRIMITIVISM.” CUBISTS, FAUVES, AND FUTURISTS TOOK THEIR FORMAL INNOVATIONS FROMAFRICAN MASKS AND ESKIMO TOTEMS. DESPITE THIS INTEREST IN THE EXOTIC AND TRIBAL,ONLY ARTAUD, OF ALL THE EUROPEAN MODERNIST ARTISTS, HAD ENOUGH DESPERATION ORCOURAGE—OFTEN THEY ARE THE SAME THING—TO VENTURE INTO THE TRIBAL REALITY AND EATTHE VISIONARY SACRAMENT FOR HIMSELF. ONLY FOR ARTAUD WAS ACHIEVING THISKNOWLEDGE A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH—OR EVEN BEYOND. HE WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ANYOTHER REWARD: “I HAD NOT CONQUERED BY FORCE OF SPIRIT THIS INVINCIBLE ORGANICHOSTILITY . . . IN ORDER TO BRING BACK FROM IT A COLLECTION OF MOTHEATENIMAGERY, FROM WHICH THIS AGE, THUS FAR FAITHFUL TO A WHOLE SYSTEM, WOULD AT THEVERY MOST GET A FEW NEW IDEAS FOR POSTERS AND MODELS FOR ITS FASHION DESIGNERS.”THIRTY YEARS AHEAD OF HIS TIME, ARTAUD PRESCIENTLY CONJURED THE LATE 1960S, WHENPSYCHEDELIA TURNED MASS MARKET, PRODUCING MUCH “MOTHEATEN IMAGERY” FOR THEMACHINERY OF ADVERTISING, TV, AND DESIGN.. . .THE PEYOTE DANCE, ARTAUD’S TEXT ON HIS VOYAGE, WORKED AND REWORKED OVER MANYYEARS, WHILE ITS AUTHOR SUFFERED IN MENTAL HOSPITALS, IS A FRACTURED NARRATIVEMADE UP OF STOPS AND STARTS, CONVULSIVE REVELATIONS AND TORMENTED CRIES. AUNIQUE MYTHO-POETIC MASTERPIECE, HIS TEXT IS SHOT THROUGH WITH CHRISTIAN IMAGESOF CRUCIFIXION AND REDEMPTION, THE PRESSURE OF HIS MADNESS, HIS YEARNING TOREENCHANT THE WORLD. “FOR THERE IS IN CONSCIOUSNESS A MAGIC WITH WHICH ONE CANGO BEYOND THINGS. AND PEYOTE TELLS US WHERE THIS MAGIC IS, AND AFTER WHATSTRANGE CONCRETIONS, WHOSE BREATH IS ATAVISTICALLY COMPRESSED AND OBSTRUCTED,THE FANTASTIC CAN EMERGE AND CAN ONCE AGAIN SCATTER IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS ITSPHOSPHORESCENCE AND ITS HAZE.”THE TARAHUMARA, FAR FROM BEING SAVAGE OR BACKWARDS IN THEIR BELIEFS, WEREACTIVELY SEEKING ANSWERS TO THE DEEPEST QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY. “INCREDIBLE ASIT MAY SEEM, THE TARAHUMARA INDIANS LIVE AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY DEAD. THEY DONOT SEE REALITY AND THEY DRAW MAGICAL POWERS FROM THE CONTEMPT THEY HAVE FORCIVILIZATION.” THE INDIANS PURSUED METAPHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE IN A DIRECT, VISCERALWAY, THROUGH DANCE, RITUAL, AND, ABOVE ALL, THROUGH PEYOTE. “THE WHOLE LIFE OFTHE TARAHUMARA REVOLVES AROUND THE EROTIC PEYOTE ROOT.”THE TARAHUMARA SHAMANS FOOLED WITH ARTAUD AT FIRST, AS SHAMANS LIKE TO DO. “THEYTHRUST ON ME THESE OLD MEN THAT WOULD SUDDENLY GET THE BENDS AND JIGGLE THEIRAMULETS IN A QUEER WAY,” THE POET COMPLAINED. “I SAW THEY WERE PALMING OFFJUGGLERS—NOT SORCERERS—ON ME.” AT FIRST THE INDIANS DID NOT WANT HIM TOPARTICIPATE IN THE CIGURI RITUALS: “PEYOTE, I KNEW, WAS NOT MADE FOR WHITES. ITWAS NECESSARY AT ALL COSTS TO PREVENT ME FROM OBTAINING A CURE BY THIS RITEWHICH WAS CREATED TO ACT ON THE VERY NATURE OF THE SPIRITS. AND A WHITE, FORTHESE RED MEN, IS ONE WHOM THE SPIRITS HAVE ABANDONED.”BUT ARTAUD WAS TENACIOUS. HE WAITED THEM OUT. HE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE MEXICANGOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO STOP THE PEYOTE RITUALS; HE CONFRONTED THE LOCALSCHOOLMASTER ABOUT IT. LATER HE LEARNED THE TARAHUMARA KNEW THEIR TRADITION WASCOMING TO AN END. THE SPIRIT WAS ABANDONING THEM—AND ALL MEN. “TIME HAS GROWNTOO OLD FOR MAN,” A PRIEST TOLD HIM.HE MADE FRIENDS WITH A TRIBESMAN WHO EXPLAINED, AT LEAST IN ARTAUD’SRECOLLECTION: “PEYOTE REVIVES THROUGHOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE MEMORY OFCERTAIN SUPREME TRUTHS BY MEANS OF WHICH HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT LOSE BUTON THE CONTRARY REGAINS ITS PERCEPTION OF THE INFINITE.”EVENTUALLY THE REAL SHAMANS ARRIVED. HE WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN THEIR ALL-NIGHTPEYOTE CEREMONY. HE WAS THE FIRST WHITE MAN, THE FIRST WESTERN INTELLECTUAL, TODO SO.HE ATE A FISTFUL OF THE POWDERED ROOT, RECEIVED THOSE “DANGEROUS DISASSOCIATIONSIT SEEMS PEYOTE PROVOKES, AND WHICH I HAD FOR TWENTY YEARS SOUGHT BY OTHERMEANS.” HE WATCHED PRIMORDIAL SYMBOLS RISE FROM HIS INNER ORGANS: “THE THINGSTHAT EMERGED FROM MY SPLEEN OR MY LIVER WERE SHAPED LIKE THE LETTERS OF A VERYANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS ALPHABET CHEWED BY AN ENORMOUS MOUTH, BUT TERRIFYING,OBSCURE, PROUD, ILLEGIBLE, JEALOUS OF ITS INVISIBILITY.” HE WITNESSED THE FIERYLETTERS J AND E BURNING AT THE BOTTOM OF A VOID—AN IMMENSE VOID THAT WAS SOMEHOWCONTAINED WITHIN HIS OWN BODY.“PEYOTE LEADS THE SELF BACK TO ITS TRUE SOURCES,” HE WROTE. “ONCE ONE HASEXPERIENCED A VISIONARY STATE OF THIS KIND, ONE CAN NO LONGER CONFUSE THE LIEWITH THE TRUTH. ONE HAS SEEN WHERE ONE COMES FROM AND WHO ONE IS, AND ONE NOLONGER DOUBTS WHAT ONE IS. THERE IS NO EMOTION OR EXTERNAL INFLUENCE THAT CANDIVERT ONE FROM THIS REALITY.”AS POWERFUL AS THEY WERE, THESE REVELATIONS COULD NOT CURE HIS INNER DIVISIONS.THEY COULD NOT HEAL HIM. ARTAUD SPENT THE LAST TWELVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE INMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, TREATED BY ELECTROSHOCK, WRITING PARANOID LETTERS ANDINCREASINGLY INCOHERENT RANTS, AND REVISING THE TEXT OF HIS REVELATIONS AMONGTHE TARAHUMARA. LIKE SOME OF THE PSYCHEDELIC MARTYRS OF THE 1960S, ARTAUD’SQUEST FOR SHAMANIC KNOWLEDGE ENDED IN SELF-DESTRUCTION. BUT WHAT OTHER FATE WASPOSSIBLE OR EVEN CONCEIVABLE FOR THE MODERN WESTERN ARTIST, COMPELLED BEYOND ANYWORLDLY AMBITION TO CROSS THE SPIRITUAL WASTELAND, TO RESACRALIZE HIMSELF ANDHIS CULTURE?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18AN ORGY OF VISION[images/00006.jpg] THE WASSONS INTRODUCED THE MAGIC MUSHROOMS TO THE MODERNWORLD IN THE 1950S, BUT THE WEST HAD KNOWN ABOUT PEYOTE FOR CENTURIES. ARTAUDMADE HIS PILGRIMAGE TO THE MOUNTAINS OF THE TARAHUMARA FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AFTERSPANISH EXPLORERS AND OVERSEERS FIRST ENCOUNTERED NATIVE USE OF THE CACTUS. THESPANISH FRANCISCAN FRIAR SAHAGUN WROTE ABOUT THE CACTUS PRODUCING “VISIONSEITHER FRIGHTFUL OR LAUGHABLE” AS EARLY AS 1560. “IT IS A SORT OF DELICACY OFTHE CHICHIMECAS,” SAHAGUN OBSERVED, “IT SUSTAINS THEM AND GIVES THEM COURAGE TOFIGHT AND NOT FEEL FEAR, NOR HUNGER, NOR THIRST, AND THEY SAY IT PROTECTS THEMFROM ANY DANGER.” EARLY CHRONICLERS SUCH AS FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ ALSO NOTED THEMEDICINAL BENEFITS ASCRIBED TO IT: “GROUND UP AND APPLIED TO PAINFUL JOINTS, ITIS SAID TO GIVE RELIEF.”EARLY EUROPEAN TRAVELERS AND MONKS DID NOT TASTE PEYOTE FOR THEMSELVES, OR IFTHEY DID THEY DIDN’T WRITE ABOUT IT, AND THE CEREMONIAL USE OF THE CACTUS WASSOON DISMISSED AS A SAVAGE CUSTOM AND DEMONIZED. IN 1620, THE “INQUISITIONAGAINST HERESY, DEPRAVITY AND APOSTASY” IN MEXICO CITY PROHIBITED INDIANS FROMIMBIBING THIS DELICACY, “REPROVED AS OPPOSED TO THE PURITY AND SINCERITY OF THEHOLY CATHOLIC FAITH.” THE VISIONS PRODUCED BY THE PLANT WERE ATTRIBUTED TO “THESUGGESTION AND ASSISTANCE OF THE DEVIL, AUTHOR OF THIS ABUSE. . . .” DESPITE THEDANGERS OF PERSECUTION, INDIAN GROUPS SUCH AS THE HUICHOL AND TARAHUMARASECRETLY PRESERVED THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CACTUS—TO END THE CONNECTIONWOULD HAVE BEEN TO DESTROY THEIR CULTURES ENTIRELY. ASSAULTED BY THE FANATICISMAND IGNORANCE OF THE SPANIARDS, THE INDIANS ADOPTED CHRISTIANITY, BUT THEYLEARNED TO PURSUE THEIR OLD RELIGIONS IN SECRET, AND THEY SAW NO CONTRADICTIONIN THIS.MESCALINE, THE ESSENTIAL ALKALOID IN PEYOTE, WAS THE FIRST PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDTO BE ISOLATED BY WESTERN SCIENTISTS. IN THE 1880S, THE GERMAN SCIENTIST LOUISLEWIN ISOLATED THE ACTIVE ALKALOIDS. IN THE NEXT DECADE, THE HARD, GRAY, BITTERBUTTONS OF THE CACTUS, WHICH ARE DISTINGUISHED BY TUFTS OF HAIR AND SPIRALINGGEOMETRIC PATTERNS ON THEIR TOPS, MADE THE ROUNDS OF ELITE INTELLECTUAL CIRCLESIN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. AMONG THE LUMINARIES WHO TRIED PEYOTE IN THE1890S WERE WILLIAM JAMES, WHO SUFFERED STOMACH PAINS WITHOUT GETTING VISIONS,AND W. B. YEATS, WHO FOUND IT SIMILAR TO HASHISH. THE WELL-KNOWN PSYCHOLOGISTSS. WEIR MITCHELL AND HAVELOCK ELLIS ALSO TESTED THE COMPOUND ON THEMSELVES. THEYWROTE LONG DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PECULIAR VISIONS THAT RESULTED.ANTICIPATING THE PAINTINGS OF SALVADOR DALI, WEIR MITCHELL FOUND HIMSELF FACINGA “HUGE CLIFF” WITH A “BIRD CLAW OF STONE” GRIPPING IT. FROM THE LEG OF THISBIRD “HUNG A FRAGMENT OF SOME STUFF. THIS BEGAN TO UNROLL AND FLOAT OUT TO ADISTANCE WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO REPRESENT TIME AS WELL AS THE IMMENSITY OF SPACE.HERE WERE MILES OF RIPPLED PURPLES, HALF TRANSPARENT, AND OF INEFFABLE BEAUTY.”GREEN BIRDS FLUTTERED DOWN INTO THE ABYSS, AND HE SAW “CLUSTERS OF STONESHANGING IN MASSES FROM THE CLAW TOES, AS IT SEEMED TO ME MILES OF THEM, DOWN FARBELOW INTO THE UNDERWORLD OF THE BLACK GULF.” AFTER THE TRIP, HE SUFFEREDHEADACHES AND “A SMART ATTACK OF GASTRIC DISTRESS.” THE EXPERIENCE “WAS WORTHONE HEADACHE AND INDIGESTION, BUT WAS NOT WORTH A SECOND,” AND HE DOUBTED THEREWAS MUCH THERAPEUTIC POTENTIALIN IT.HAVELOCK ELLIS DESCRIBED HIS TRIP AS “AN ORGY OF VISION.” AT ONE POINT HE SAWHIMSELF “AS THOUGH I WERE INSIDE A CHINESE LANTERN, LOOKING OUT THROUGH MY CHEEKINTO THE ROOM.” WEIR MITCHELL AND ELLIS WERE INTRIGUED BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUSHALLUCINATIONS, WHICH RESEMBLED THE MOST ELABORATE OPIUM FANTASIES OF DEQUINCEY, BUT THEY DID NOT FIND THEM ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL. WEIR MITCHELLPREDICTED “A PERILOUS REIGN OF THE MESCAL HABIT WHEN THIS AGENT BECOMESATTAINABLE.” ELLIS THOUGHT THE DRUG, WHILE “AN UNFORGETTABLE DELIGHT,” WAS TOOINTELLECTUAL IN ITS CHARACTER TO HAVE A WIDE APPEAL.LOUIS LEWIN, AUTHOR OF THE BOOK PHANTASTICA, AN EARLY ATTEMPT TO CLASSIFY THEEFFECTS OF VARIOUS MIND-ALTERING PLANTS, REALIZED THAT THE COLORFULHALLUCINATIONS PRODUCED BY PEYOTE WERE LESS MEANINGFUL THAN THE PLANT’S OTHEREFFECTS: “THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT IN THE WHOLE MECHANISM OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEXIS THE MODIFICATION OF THE MENTAL STATE, THE MODIFICATION OF PSYCHOLOGICALLIFE,” HE WROTE IN THE 1920S. PEYOTE CAUSED “HITHERTO UNKNOWN SPIRITUALEXPERIENCES COMPARED WITH WHICH THE HALLUCINATIONS LOSE IN IMPORTANCE.” LEWINWAS FAR AHEAD OF HIS TIME IN SUGGESTING THAT THE TRANSCENDENT SENSE OF UNITY, OFCONNECTION TO THE WORLD AND DISSOLUTION OF THE EGO, OFTEN IMPARTED BY PEYOTE ANDLSD, WAS MORE MEANINGFUL THAN ANY PSYCHEDELIC FIREWORKS.ALTHOUGH A HANDUL OF ARTISTS AND OCCULTISTS EXPERIMENTED WITH MESCALINE, THEDISCOVERY DID NOT CREATE GENERAL INTEREST IN EUROPE AT THAT POINT, OR IN THEDECADES TO FOLLOW. I SUSPECT THAT THE EUROPEAN CONSCIOUSNESS OF THAT ERA, FROMTHE LATE 1890S THROUGH THE SECOND WORLD WAR, WASN’T PREPARED FOR THE HARD-CORESURREALISM, THE SCI-FI SENSORIAL RUPTURES, OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS. THE EUROPEANSWHO EXPERIMENTED WITH PEYOTE, OR MESCALINE, THE HALLUCINOGEN’S PURIFIED ANDCRYSTALLINE FORM, HAD NO CONTEXT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY WERE SEEING, ANDTHE MAIN EFFECT ON THEM WAS PSYCHIC ESTRANGEMENT. THE DREAM AGITPROP OFSURREALISM, THE BIRTH OF MONTAGE IN FILM AND THE TRAUMA OF TWO WORLD WARS OPENEDTHE WESTERN MIND TO THE PSYCHEDELIC SHOCK AS VISIONARY CATALYST.FOR THOSE WHO TRIED THE TRIBAL HALLUCINOGENS WITHOUT PROPER PREPARATION, THERESULTS COULD BE DISASTROUS. JEAN-PAUL SARTRE, FOR EXAMPLE, TOOK MESCALINE INPARIS DURING AN EXPERIMENTAL CLINICAL TRIAL IN 1935. FOR OVER A WEEK, LONG AFTERTHE PHYSICAL EFFECT OF THE DRUG HAD WORN OFF, SARTRE FOUND HIMSELF PLUNGED INTOA LINGERING NIGHTMARE OF PSYCHOTIC DREAD AND PARANOIA; SHOES THREATENED TO TURNINTO INSECTS, STONE WALLS SEETHED WITH MONSTERS. HE WAS BEWILDERED,TERRIFIED—THE PHYSICAL SICKNESS AND PSYCHIC ANGUISH MAY HAVE INSPIRED HIS NOVELLA NAUSÉE, IN WHICH THE WRITHING BARK ON A SINGLE TREE REVEALS WHAT HE SAW ASTHE MECHANISTIC HORROR OF NATURE.. . .“THE EARTH HAS HAD ALL THE EXOTICISM WASHED OUT OF IT,” THE YOUNG POET ANDPAINTER HENRI MICHAUX LAMENTED DURING A 1928 VISIT TO ECUADOR. “IF IN A HUNDREDYEARS WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH SOME OTHER PLANET (BUT WE WILL), OR,NEXT BEST, WITH THE EARTH’S INTERIOR, HUMANITY IS FINISHED. . . . WE ARE INMORTAL PAIN, BOTH FROM THE DIMENSIONS AS THEY NOW STAND, AND FROM THE LACK OFANY FUTURE DIMENSIONS TO WHICH WE CAN TURN, NOW THAT OUR TOUR OF THE EARTH HASBEEN DONE TO DEATH.” LIKE MANY INTELLECTUALS, MICHAUX SOUGHT AN ESCAPE FROM THEWEST AFTER THE SENSELESS CARNAGE OF WORLD WAR I.IF NOT ANOTHER PLANET, MICHAUX DISCOVERED AN INTERIOR ESCAPE A FEW DECADESLATER, WHEN HE STARTED DOSING HIMSELF WITH MESCALINE. IT WAS IN THE EARLY 1950S,A TIME WHEN MESCALINE WAS AGAIN MAKING THE ROUNDS OF WESTERN INTELLECTUALS,ARTISTS, AND WELL-HEELED MYSTICS. “A RAPE, AN ATROCIOUS VOLTAGE . . .ANNIHILATING THE MACHINERY OF THE MIND” IS HOW MICHAUX DESCRIBED HIS MESCALINEJOURNEYS. “MESCALINE MULTIPLIES, SHARPENS, ACCELERATES, INTENSIFIES THE INNERMOMENTS OF BECOMING CONSCIOUS,” HE WROTE. “YOU WATCH THEIR EXTRAORDINARY FLOOD,MESMERIZED, UNCOMPREHENDING.” IMAGES REPEATED ENDLESSLY, LIKE PSYCHICWALLPAPER—A FACE, A GLASS STAIRCASE, A PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. “WITH YOUR EYES SHUT,YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IMMENSE WORLD. NOTHING HAS PREPARED YOU FOR THIS.YOU DON’T RECOGNIZE IT.”OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IN BOOKS SUCH AS MISERABLE MIRACLE, IN HIS ABSTRACTDRAWINGS AND PAINTINGS, MICHAUX SOUGHT TO CAPTURE THE INFINITE DIVISIONS, THEEGO-SPLITTINGS AND IMAGISTIC EXPLOSIONS, HE FOUND ON HIS TRIPS: “I SHONE, I WASSHATTERED, I SHOUTED TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. I SHIVERED, MY SHIVERING WAS ABARKING. I PRESSED FORWARD, I RUSHED DOWN, I PLUNGED INTO TRANSPARENCY, I LIVEDCRYSTALLINELY.”HE USED THE CHEMICAL TO DISSECT THE INTERIOR REGIONS OF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS,DESCRIBING INCREDIBLE ACCELERATIONS, SLOWDOWNS, REPETITIONS, PSYCHICDISPERSIONS. HE STRUGGLED TO GRASP THE DRUG’S ALIEN MEANING, ITS CHARACTER, BUTHE COULD NOT MAKE SENSE OF IT. MICHAUX’S STUDY OF MESCALINE WAS AESTHETICIZED,UTTERLY ALIENATED FROM THE SHAMANIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUICHOL AND TARAHUMARA. THEINDIANS TOOK PEYOTE AS MEDICINE FOR THE BODY AND SOUL AND HAD COGNITIVE MAPS OFTHE SPIRIT REALMS IT REVEALED. MICHAUX EXPLORED THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCEPRIMARILY AS AN ARTISTIC STIMULUS, AND COULD THEREFORE RELATE TO IT ONLY ASSOMETHING EXOTIC AND IMPERSONAL, INSPIRATIONAL BUT SINISTER. “THAT WORLD ISANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS,” HE WROTE. BUT THE ESSENCE OF THAT OTHERNESS ELUDED HIM."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19A SEA OF SPIRITUALPROTOPLASM[images/00006.jpg] ARTAUD AND MICHAUX RECOUNTED THEIR HALLUCINOGENIC FORAYS INFRACTURED MODERNIST STYLE. THE BRITISH NOVELIST ALDOUS HUXLEY NARRATED THEACCOUNT OF HIS 1953 MESCALINE TRIP WITH THE DRY WIT AND CLARITY OF AN ENGLISHDETECTIVE NOVELIST OR A BOY’S ADVENTURE WRITER. IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE DOORSOF PERCEPTION, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL WORK OF WESTERN PSYCHEDELIC LITERATURE,HUXLEY ANNOUNCES HIS INTENT TO JOIN “THE SLEUTHS—BIOCHEMISTS, PSYCHIATRISTS,PSYCHOLOGISTS”—ON THE TRAIL OF MESCALINE.HUXLEY UNDERTOOK HIS MESCALINE JOURNEY IN 1953, THE SAME YEAR THE WASSONS FIRSTTRIED PSILOCYBIN. THE AUTHOR OF NUMEROUS NOVELS AND LITERARY ESSAYS, AS WELL ASTHE BEST-SELLING WORK OF PREDICTIVE SCIENCE FICTION, BRAVE NEW WORLD, HE HADLONG BEEN FASCINATED BY MYSTICISM. THIS FASCINATION WAS IN SPITE, OR PERHAPSBECAUSE, OF THE FACT THAT HIS OWN TENDENCY AS A THINKER AND A WRITER WAS TOWARDA PROLIFIC BUT SLIGHTLY INERT RATIONALITY. “THERE WAS SOMETHING AMOEBOID ABOUTPHILLIP QUAYLE’S MIND,” HUXLEY WROTE IN THE NOVEL POINT COUNTER POINT,DESCRIBING HIS ALTER EGO. “IT WAS LIKE A SEA OF SPIRITUAL PROTOPLASM, CAPABLE OFFLOWING IN ALL DIRECTIONS, OF ENGULFING EVERY OBJECT IN ITS PATH, OF TRICKLINGINTO EVERY CREVICE, OF FILLING EVERY MOLD.” HUXLEY’S ALMOST STIFLING LUCIDITYCOMPELLED HIM TO PUSH TOWARD DOMAINS OF THE IRRATIONAL AND UNKNOWABLE. HE ONCEWROTE TO A FRIEND, “MY PRIMARY OCCUPATION IS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SOME KIND OFOVER-ALL UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD . . . THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACTS.”LONG BEFORE HE KNEW OF PSYCHEDELICS, HUXLEY WAS FASCINATED BY MIND DRUGS ASPOTENTIAL AGENTS OF PERSONAL LIBERATION AND SOCIAL CONTROL—HIS THINKING TOGGLEDBACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES. RECOGNIZING THE AMBIVALENT POTENTIAL OFTHESE SUBSTANCES, HE INVENTED SOMA, A NARCO-HALLUCINOGEN, FOR BRAVE NEW WORLD,HIS PRESCIENT VISION OF A HIGH-TECH AUTHORITARIAN FUTURE. SOMA WAS THEENTHEOGENIC BEVERAGE DESCRIBED IN THE RIG VEDA, INSPIRATIONAL SOURCE OF THEHINDU COSMOLOGY. IN HUXLEY’S BOOK, SOMA WAS FAR FROM A BENIGN INTOXICANT.COMBINING EUPHORIC, SEDATIVE, AND HALLUCINOGENIC POWERS, SOMA FUNCTIONED AS APRECISELY CALIBRATED TOOL OF “REPRESSIVE TOLERANCE,” KEEPING THE CITIZENS OFHUXLEY’S DESIGNER DYSTOPIA DOPED AND DOCILE, HOOKED AND HAPPY.AROUND THE TIME HE WROTE BRAVE NEW WORLD, HUXLEY ALSO PENNED AN ESSAY IN WHICHHE ADMITTED YEARNING FOR A MIND DRUG THAT COULD ALLEVIATE THE BOREDOM, THE DAILYDRUDGERY, OF ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS. “IF I WERE A MILLIONAIRE, I SHOULD ENDOW ABAND OF RESEARCH WORKERS TO LOOK FOR A NEW INTOXICANT,” HE WROTE IN 1931. HISDISCOVERY OF MESCALINE, AND THEN LSD, WERE THE ANSWERS TO HIS PRAYERS. HEDEVOTED THE LAST DECADE OF HIS LIFE TO EXPLORING THESE CHEMICALS ANDPROSELYTIZING ON THEIR BEHALF. UNLIKE HIS FICTIONAL SOMA, AND DESPITE THE CIA’SBEST ATTEMPTS, MESCALINE AND LSD HAD THE ADDED BENEFITS OF BEING INEFFECTIVEAGENTS OF SOCIAL CONTROL. YET HE ANTICIPATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURALLYSANCTIONED MOOD-LIFTING DRUGS SUCH AS PROZAC AND RITALIN, WHICH WOULD BEMASS-PRESCRIBED: “THEY MAY HELP THE PSYCHIATRIST IN HIS BATTLE AGAINST MENTALILLNESS, OR THEY MAY HELP THE DICTATOR IN HIS BATTLE AGAINST FREEDOM,” HE WROTE.“MORE PROBABLY (SINCE SCIENCE IS DIVINELY IMPARTIAL) THEY WILL BOTH ENSLAVE ANDMAKE FREE, HEAL AND AT THE SAME TIME DESTROY.” HUXLEY DIED IN 1963. ON HISDEATHBED, HIS WIFE INJECTED HIM WITH A SIZABLE DOSE OF LIQUID LSD—A TRIP THATPERHAPS EVADED EVEN HIS CAPACITY FOR RATIONAL ANALYSIS.IN THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION—THE TITLE IS TAKEN FROM WILLIAM BLAKE’S LINES, “IFTHE DOORS OF PERCEPTION WERE OPEN / EVERYTHING WOULD APPEAR, AS IT IS INREALITY, INFINITE”—HUXLEY’S MANNER REMAINS SELF-ASSURED, HIS STYLE CLEAR. EVENWHEN HE APPROACHES THE PROSPECT OF COLLAPSING INTO INCOHERENCE, HE DOES IT INLIMPID PROSE. LOOKING AT A CHAIR AND SEEING AN INTENSITY OF ACTUALITY COMPARABLETO THE CHRISTIAN LAST JUDGMENT, HE NOTED: “IT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY WONDERFUL,WONDERFUL TO THE POINT, ALMOST, OF BEING TERRIFYING.” IN A FLASH, HE REALIZEDWHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO GO INSANE, TO PLUNGE INTO THE HELLS AND ALSO THEPARADISES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. HE ANALYZED THE FEAR “OF BEING OVERWHELMED, OFDISINTEGRATING UNDER A PRESSURE OF REALITY GREATER THAN A MIND, ACCUSTOMED TOLIVING MOST OF THE TIME IN A COZY WORLD OF SYMBOLS, COULD POSSIBLY BEAR.” HUXLEYIS ADMITTING HIS OWN LIMITS. HE WAS NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY CAPABLE OF STRAYING FARBEYOND HIS “COZY WORLD OF SYMBOLS.” HE COULD NEVER APPROACH THE FEVER PITCH OFARTAUD, WHO CROAKED HIS PEYOTE REVELATIONS FROM THE EDGE OF CHAOS AND DREAD.THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION WAS PROPAGANDA PROMOTING MYSTICAL PERCEPTION ASLIFESTYLE CHOICE. ALTHOUGH HUXLEY’S PERSONAL APPROACH TO PSYCHEDELICS WAS MOREMANDARIN THAN MIDCULT, THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION PAVED THE WAY FOR TIMOTHY LEARYAND THE DEBASEMENT OF THE SUBJECT INTO POP-CULTURAL FODDER. HUXLEY SUGGESTS THATMESCALINE OR A PSYCHEDELIC RELATIVE OF IT COULD BE EMPLOYED WITHIN CHRISTIANITYTO GIVE DIRECT ACCESS TO TRANSCENDENT REALITY: “TO BE SHAKEN OUT OF THE RUTS OFORDINARY PERCEPTION, TO BE SHOWN FOR A FEW TIMELESS HOURS THE OUTER AND THEINNER WORLD, NOT AS THEY APPEAR TO AN ANIMAL OBSESSED WITH SURVIVAL OR TO AHUMAN BEING OBSESSED WITH WORDS AND NOTIONS, BUT AS THEY ARE APPREHENDED,DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, BY MIND AT LARGE—THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE OF INESTIMABLEVALUE TO EVERYONE AND ESPECIALLY TO THE INTELLECTUAL.”WITH AN OVERLAY OF REFERENCES TO BLAKE, AQUINAS, GOETHE, THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THEDEAD, AND SO ON, THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION ALIENATES THE MESCALINE TRIP FROM ITSINDIGENOUS AND SHAMANIC ORIGINS. FOR THE INDIANS IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH,PEYOTE IS “GRANDFATHER.” THE BITTER-TASTING CACTUS IS, ITSELF, A SPIRITUALEMISSARY FROM THE “GREEN NATION” OF THE PLANT WORLD. THE INDIANS USE THE CACTUSONLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A CAREFULLY STRUCTURED RITUAL. PEYOTE REVEALS THATTHE NATURAL UNIVERSE IS ENTIRELY ANIMATED BY SPIRITUAL FORCES, AND THE VEGETABLEVEHICLE OF THIS MESSAGE IS INSEPARABLE FROM ITS MEANING.FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE FACT, HUXLEY’S CENTRAL ARGUMENT REMAINS ENTIRELY VALID. HEREALIZED THE MODERN WORLD WAS INCREASINGLY TRAPPED IN ITS HABITS OF MEDIATION,ITS ALMOST DESPERATE EFFORT TO PURSUE ANY SUBJECT OTHER THAN PERSONALREVELATION: A CATALOGUE, A BIBLIOGRAPHY, A DEFINITIVE EDITION OF A THIRD-RATE VERSIFIER’SIPSISSIMA VERBA, A STUPENDOUS INDEX TO END ALL INDEXES—ANY GENUINELY ALEXANDRIANPROJECT IS SURE OF APPROVAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FINDINGOUT HOW YOU AND I, OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, MAY BECOME MORE PERCEPTIVE,MORE INTENSELY AWARE OF INWARD AND OUTWARD REALITY, MORE OPEN TO THE SPIRIT,LESS APT, BY PSYCHOLOGICAL MALPRACTICES, TO MAKE OURSELVES PHYSICALLY ILL, ANDMORE CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING OUR OWN AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS—WHEN IT COMES TOANY FORM OF NON-VERBAL EDUCATION MORE FUNDAMENTAL (AND MORE LIKELY TO BE OF SOMEPRACTICAL USE) THAN SWEDISH DRILL, NO REALLY RESPECTABLE PERSON IN ANYRESPECTABLE UNIVERSITY OR CHURCH WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AS A FORM OF SOCIETAL SHOCK THERAPY IN A WORLD INCREASINGLY THREATENED BY THETECHNOLOGY IT WAS UNLEASHING, HUXLEY ADVOCATED LARGE-SCALE USE OF MESCALINE OR ASIMILAR AGENT AS A TOOL OF CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLUTION, A CHEMICAL SHORTCUT TO“DIRECT PERCEPTION, THE MORE UNSYSTEMATIC THE BETTER, OF THE INNER AND OUTERWORLD INTO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN BORN.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20A HANDFUL OF ASHES[images/00006.jpg] WHILE MODERN ARTISTS SOUGHT AN EXIT FROM THE MODERNWASTELAND, THE NEW DISCIPLINE OF ANTHROPOLOGY GAVE ITSELF THE TASK OF STUDYINGTHE NONLITERATE TRIBAL SOCIETIES AS THE COLONIAL POWERS HURRIED TO CONTAMINATEAND DESTROY THEM. THE HISTORY OF ANTHROPOLOGY IS MADE UP OF A SERIES OFMISUNDERSTANDINGS AND PROJECTIONS, DELIBERATE OBFUSCATIONS, OUTRIGHT BLUNDERS,SELL-OUTS, AND CRIMINAL ACTS. FROM FRANZ BOAS TO MARGARET MEAD, FROM CLAUDELÉVI-STRAUSS TO NAPOLEON CHAGNON, ANTHROPOLOGY HAS FUNCTIONED AS A DISTORTINGMIRROR INTO WHICH THE WEST HAS GAZED, PRETENDING TO LEARN ABOUT “THE OTHER”WHILE STUDYING ENDLESS REFLECTIONS OF ITSELF. ONTO THE NATIVE SOCIETIES WEPROJECTED OUR PRURIENT OBSESSION WITH SEXUAL RELATIONS AND THE INCEST TABOO; OURFASCINATION WITH VIOLENCE AND THE “SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.” WE STUDIED MAGICALPRACTICES IN ORDER TO DEMYSTIFY THEM OR REVEAL THEM AS FRAUDS. THROUGH OURANTHROPOLOGICAL EMISSARIES WE ENACTED OUR COMPULSION TO CONSUME THE EXOTIC AND,IN THE ACT OF CONSUMPTION, ANNIHILATE IT.IN HIS MEMOIR TRISTES TROPIQUES, LÉVI-STRAUSS MUSED ON THE FOLLY OF THEANTHROPOLOGICAL QUEST—THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONTACTING AN UNCORRUPTEDCIVILIZATION. HE IMAGINES GOING BACKWARD IN TIME. WITH EACH JUMP BACK, HEREALIZES HE WOULD REGAIN LOST CUSTOMS WHILE HE FOREFEITS THE ABILITY TOINTERPRET THEM: “I CAN BE LIKE SOME TRAVELLER OF THE OLDEN DAYS, WHO WAS FACEDWITH A STUPENDOUS SPECTACLE, ALL, OR ALMOST ALL, OF WHICH ELUDED HIM, OR WORSESTILL, FILLED HIM WITH SCORN AND DISGUST; OR I CAN BE A MODERN TRAVELLER,CHASING AFTER THE VESTIGES OF A VANISHED REALITY.” FOR THE STERN PATRIARCH OFSTRUCTURALISM, THIS VICIOUS CIRCLE PROVED THAT ANTHROPOLOGY CAN NEVER REACH ITSOBJECT.IN HIS DARKEST MOMENTS, LÉVI-STRAUSS GIVES HIMSELF OVER TO NIHILISM. “JOURNEYS,THOSE MAGIC CASKETS FULL OF DREAMLIKE PROMISES, WILL NEVER AGAIN YIELD UP THEIRTREASURES UNTARNISHED,” HE MOURNS. THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE WESTERN WORLD, ITS“ORDER AND HARMONY” WERE BASED ON CONTAMINATION AND POLLUTANTS EMITTED ON AGLOBAL SCALE: “THE FIRST THING WE SEE AS WE TRAVEL ROUND THE WORLD IS OUR OWNFILTH, THROWN IN THE FACE OF MANKIND.” EVERYWHERE HE LOOKS HE FINDS APOCALYPTICSQUALOR, ENTROPY—THE WASTELAND. HE REDEFINED ANTHROPOLOGY AS “ENTROPOLOGY,” THESTUDY OF A WORLD RUNNING DOWN.LÉVI-STRAUSS EQUATES THE VOGUE FOR TRAVEL WRITING—FOR POPULAR NARRATIVES OFVISITS TO EXOTIC CULTURES—WITH THE “QUEST FOR POWER” OF ADOLESCENTS UNDERGOINGINITIATION RITUALS IN TRIBAL SOCIETIES. THE “DAZED, DEBILITATED, AND DELIRIOUS”INITIATES GO INTO THE WILDERNESS, BELIEVING “THAT A MAGIC ANIMAL, TOUCHED BY THEINTENSITY OF THEIR SUFFERINGS AND THEIR PRAYERS, WILL BE FORCED TO APPEAR TOTHEM.” THIS “ABSURD AND DESPERATE ATTEMPT” TO CONTACT THE SPIRITUAL WORLD BYBREAKING AWAY FROM THE SOCIAL WORLD, LÉVI-STRAUSS BELIEVES, FINDS ITS STRUCTURALPARALLEL IN THE YOUNG TRAVEL WRITER OF THE WEST WHO BRIEFLY EXPOSES HIMSELF TOAN EXTREME SITUATION AND RETURNS “ENDOWED WITH A POWER WHICH FINDS EXPRESSION INTHE WRITING OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES AND BESTSELLERS . . . ITS MAGIC CHARACTER ISEVIDENCED BY THE PROCESS OF SELF-DELUSION OPERATING IN THE SOCIETY AND WHICHEXPLAINS THE PHENOMENON IN ALL CASES.”LÉVI-STRAUSS’S WORK, HIS EFFORT TO “RECAPTURE THE MASTER MEANING,” IS ANIMATEDBY A FEVERISH URGE TO DEMYSTIFY. “CAN IT BE THAT I, THE ELDERLY PREDECESSOR OFTHOSE SCOURERS OF THE JUNGLE, AM THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE BROUGHT BACK NOTHING BUT AHANDFUL OF ASHES? IS MINE THE ONLY VOICE TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OFESCAPISM?” HIS DEMYTHIFYING “SCIENCE” TAKES PART IN THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION,WHAT HE CALLS THE IRREVOCABLE RESULT OF HUMAN HISTORY: “MANKIND HAS OPTED FORMONOCULTURE; IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A MASS CIVILIZATION, AS BEETROOTIS GROWN IN THE MASS,” HE WRITES. “HENCEFORTH, MAN’S DAILY BILL OF FARE WILLCONSIST ONLY OF THIS ONE ITEM.”HIS MEMOIR IS THE TRIUMPHANT LAMENT OF THE MANIACAL RATIONALIST WHO WILL NOT BETAKEN IN BY ANY RUSE, ANY MYSTICAL VIBRATION OR FLEETING HOPE, WHO ALLOWS US NOPOSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE. BUT THIS NIGHTMARISH VISION OF TRIUMPHANT MECHANIZATIONIS, IT MUST BE SAID, ALSO A MYTH.IN A CENTRAL CHAPTER OF TRISTES TROPIQUES, LÉVI-STRAUSS STUDIES THE INTRICATEBODY PAINTING OF THE CADUVEO INDIANS OF BRAZIL: “THEIR FACES, AND SOMETIMES EVENTHEIR WHOLE BODIES, WERE COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF ASYMMETRICAL ARABESQUES,ALTERNATING WITH DELICATE GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS.” LÉVI-STRAUSS IS FASCINATED BYTHESE PATTERNS, WHICH LOOK TO HIM LIKE THE BACKS OF EUROPEAN PLAYING CARDS. THEINDIANS, HOWEVER, REFUSE TO ELUCIDATE THE REASON FOR THEIR DECORATIONS.ULTIMATELY, HE DECIDES THAT THE BODY PAINTINGS HAVE A PURELY “SOCIOLOGICALFUNCTION.” THE CADUVEOS LACKED COMPLEX SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS (NO ACADÉMIEFRANÇAISE, NO BIBLIOTHÈQUE NATIONALE), AND THE “MYSTERIOUS APPEAL AND SEEMINGLYGRATUITOUS COMPLEXITY” OF THE PATTERNS WERE THEREFORE “THE PHANTASM OF A SOCIETYARDENTLY AND INSATIABLY SEEKING A MEANS OF EXPRESSING SYMBOLICALLY THEINSTITUTIONS IT MIGHT HAVE, IF ITS INTERESTS AND SUPERSTITIONS DID NOT STAND INTHE WAY.”HIS PATRONIZING ATTITUDE TOWARD THE INDIAN SPIRITUAL CULTURE REFLECTED FIVEHUNDRED YEARS OF COLONIAL REPRESSION AND EUROPEAN SNOBBERY. LÉVI-STRAUSS BARELYALLUDES TO THE USE OF PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS AMONG THE INDIANS, ALTHOUGH THIS USEIS THE LIKELY ORIGIN FOR THE ORNAMENTS THAT FASCINATE HIM. HE DOES NOT SUSPECTTHAT THE BODY PATTERNS MIGHT BE A FORM OF COMMUNION WITH A SACRED REALITY THATTHE INDIANS KNEW THROUGH THEIR OWN VISIONS, A KNOWLEDGE THEY CHOSE TO HIDE FROMFOREIGN INTERLOPERS.WHEN PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS SUDDENLY ERUPTED AS A FORCE IN WESTERN CONSCIOUSNESS INTHE 1960S, ANTHROPOLOGISTS BEGAN TO WONDER ABOUT THEIR USE IN ABORIGINALSOCIETIES. A FEW FIELD-WORKERS TENTATIVELY STARTED TO LOOK DEEPER INTO THEMEANING OF THE HALLUCINOGENIC REVELATIONS KNOWN TO THE INDIANS. SOME OF THEMEVEN TRIED THE PLANTS AND POTIONS FOR THEMSELVES AS PART OF THEIR FIELDWORK, BUTTHIS TESTING WAS ALWAYS DONE AS AN ASIDE, A FOOTNOTE APPENDED TO THE REAL WORKTHEY WERE DOING. WHEN THESE ANTHROPOLOGISTS INTERPRETED WHAT THEY SAW, THEYMAPPED THE VISIONARY DIMENSION BACK ONTO THE SOCIOLOGICAL MODELS THEY HADLEARNED IN UNIVERSITIES. INVESTED IN THE IDEOLOGY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE, THEY NEEDEDTO PROVE THAT SOCIAL CODES ALWAYS STRUCTURED THE VISIONARY EXPERIENCE—THEYNEEDED TO PROVE IT, AND SO THEY DID.IN 1969, THE ANTHROPOLOGIST GERARDO REICHEL-DOLMATOFF WROTE A PAPER ON THETUKANO INDIANS OF COLOMBIA AND THEIR USE OF BANISTERIOPSIS CAAPI (A.K.A.AYAHUASCA OR YAGÉ): “FOR THE ANTHROPOLOGIST IT IS MOST INTRIGUING THAT THEINDIANS MAINTAIN THAT EVERYTHING WE WOULD DESIGNATE AS ART IS INSPIRED AND BASEDUPON THE HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCE.” ACCORDING TO THE INDIANS, THEIR ENTIRECULTURE WAS BASED ON AYAHUASCA: “THEY DO NOT SIMPLY WITNESS VISUALHALLUCINATIONS BUT ALSO HEAR MUSIC AND SEE DANCES.” REICHEL-DOLMATOFF TRIED THETUKANO POTION. HE SAW STREAMS OF CONSTANTLY CHANGING IMAGES: “LIKEMICROPHOTOGRAPHS OF PLANTS . . . LIKE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS. . . . THESE THINGSDRAWING NEAR ARE LIKE BODIES . . . NOW THEY ARE LIKE CATERPILLARS WITH A LOT OFQUILLS AND FUR . . . LIKE CERTAIN TIES IN BAD TASTE.”REICHEL-DOLMATOFF WAS ABLE TO DEFTLY DESCRIBE AND ANALYZE NATIVE CUSTOMS ANDSPIRITUAL BELIEFS, BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND VALIDITY IN HIS OWN VISIONARYEXPERIENCE. DESPITE A TRIP THAT SEEMS ASTONISHINGLY TRANSCULTURAL, WORTHY OFCAREFUL ANALYSIS, REICHEL-DOLMATOFF ASSERTS, “IN A STATE OF HALLUCINATION THEINDIVIDUAL PROJECTS HIS CULTURAL MEMORY ON THE WAVERING SCREEN OF COLORS ANDSHAPES AND THUS ‘SEES’ CERTAIN MOTIFS AND PERSONAGES.” NOTING HOW THE TUKANODESCRIBE THEIR VISIONS TO EACH OTHER, THE ANTHROPOLOGIST IS QUICK TO ADD, “THISOPEN COMMUNICATION OF EXPERIENCES COULD LEAD TO A CONSENSUS, TO A FIXATION OFCERTAIN IMAGES; IN THIS MANNER, NO MATTER WHAT THE VISION, ITS INTERPRETATIONCOULD BE ADAPTED TO A CULTURAL PATTERN.”AROUND THE SAME TIME, MARLENE DOBKIN DE RIOS STUDIED RITUALS OF AYAHUASCAHEALING AMONG MESTIZOS IN IQUITOS, PERU, FOR HER BOOK VISIONARY VINE. DURING HEROWN AYAHUASCA TRIP SHE SAW “VERY FAST MOVING IMAGERY ALMOST LIKE BOSCH’SPAINTINGS . . . A SERIES OF LEAF-FACED VISIONS . . . FOLLOWED BY A FULL-LENGTHCOLORED VISION OF A PERUVIAN WOMAN, UNKNOWN TO ME, BUT SNEERING IN MYDIRECTION.” AFTERWARD, SHE WROTE, “NO JUNGLE CREATURES FILLED MY VISIONS. . . .THE VISIONS I HAD CONTAINED SYMBOLS OF MY OWN CULTURE.” WERE “LEAF-FACEDVISIONS” REALLY A PART OF HER CULTURE? THE ANTHROPOLOGIST’S INSISTENCE THATAYAHUASCA VISIONS CAN ONLY BE A PROJECTION OF “CULTURAL MEMORY,” A RESHUFFLINGOF “SYMBOLS” FROM ONE’S OWN BACKGROUND, NEATLY CONVEYS AN IMPRESSION OFSCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVITY WHILE IGNORING HER ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.IN THE LATE 1950S THE ANTHROPOLOGIST MICHAEL HARNER WORKED WITH THE JIVAROINDIANS IN THE AMAZON. AT THAT POINT, “I DID NOT FULLY APPRECIATE THEPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THE BANISTERIOPSIS DRINK UPON THE NATIVE VIEW OFREALITY.” HE DID NOT APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE HE DID NOT TRY IT. A FEW YEARS LATER,HE DRANK A WHOPPING DOSE OF AYAHUASCA FOR HIMSELF, WITH A DIFFERENT TRIBE, THECONIBO, IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON: “FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER DRINKING THE BREW, IFOUND MYSELF, ALTHOUGH AWAKE, IN A WORLD LITERALLY BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS. IMET BIRD-HEADED PEOPLE, AS WELL AS DRAGON-LIKE CREATURES WHO EXPLAINED THAT THEYWERE THE TRUE GODS OF THIS WORLD. I ENLISTED THE SERVICES OF OTHER SPIRITHELPERS IN ATTEMPTING TO FLY THROUGH THE FAR REACHES OF THE GALAXY.” THE NEXTDAY, HE TOLD A BLIND SHAMAN ABOUT THE DRAGONS WHO SAID THEY HAD CREATED THEWORLD. THE SHAMAN SMILED KNOWINGLY. “OH, THEY’RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT. BUT THEYARE ONLY THE MASTERS OF OUTER DARKNESS.”HARNER HAD ENCOUNTERED AN OVERWHELMING ALTERNATE REALITY THAT COULD NOT BEIGNORED, EXPLAINED AWAY, OR SOCIOLOGICALLY PIGEONHOLED. “TRANSPORTED INTO ATRANCE WHERE THE SUPERNATURAL SEEMED NATURAL, I REALIZED THAT ANTHROPOLOGISTS,INCLUDING MYSELF, HAD PROFOUNDLY UNDERESTIMATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DRUG INAFFECTING NATIVE IDEOLOGY.” EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT, HARNER HAS DEVOTED HIMSELF TOUNDERSTANDING SHAMANISM. HE STARTED AN INSTITUTE OF SHAMANIC STUDIES IN THEUNITED STATES, ATTEMPTING TO TEACH SHAMANIC TECHNIQUES OF DRUMMING AND HEALINGTO WESTERNERS.HARNER WAS A MODERN ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO WENT INTO THE FIELD ARMED WITH ALL OFLÉVI-STRAUSS’S TOOLS OF ANALYTIC DISTANCING. WHILE LÉVI-STRAUSS PRESERVED HISFLAWLESS IRONIC DETACHMENT AND OUTSIDER STATUS, HARNER, ANIMATED BY THEINQUISITIVE SPIRIT OF A DIFFERENT GENERATION, TOOK THE PROFESSIONAL RISK OFTESTING THE NATIVE’S SACRED REALITY FOR HIMSELF. THERE HE FOUND SOMETHING MUCHSTRANGER AND MORE ASTONISHING THAN A “HANDFUL OF ASHES.” HE FOUND A MAGICALTHEATER WITHIN HIS OWN MIND WHERE THE SUPERNATURAL WAS PERFORMING A SPECTACLETHAT WAS AS REAL AS WAKING REALITY, MORE TANGIBLE THAN ANY DREAM. THIS SPECTACLEHAD NO CONNECTION TO HIS EXPECTATIONS OR HIS BELIEFS—IT WAS NOT A PRODUCT OF HISPERSONAL IDENTITY, HIS FREUDIAN UNCONSCIOUS. IT WAS NOT THE FAULTY WIRING OF HISSYNAPSES BLOWING A FUSE. IT WAS THE REVELATION OF A DIFFERENT ORDER, A PROFOUNDAND ARCANE OTHERNESS. THE REVELATION SPUN AROUND THE ENTIRE COMPASS OF HARNER’STHOUGHT. IT TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE.HISTORY IS A PROCESS OF AWAKENING, OF BRINGING INTO AWARENESS THE “NOT-YETCONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE” OF WHAT HAS BEEN. THE PLANTS THAT PRODUCE VISIONS CANFUNCTION—FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE INHERITED THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BARRENMATERIALISM, CUT OFF FROM OUR SPIRITUAL HERITAGE BY A SPITEFUL CULTURE THATGIVES US NOTHING BUT ASHES—AS THE TALISMANS OF RECOGNITION THAT AWAKEN OUR MINDSTO REALITY."},{"pageContent":"[images/00010.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21THE PURGE[images/00006.jpg] “I WAS ON ALL FOURS CONVULSED WITH SPASMS OF NAUSEA,”WILLIAM BURROUGHS WROTE TO ALLEN GINSBERG, DESCRIBING A YAGÉ SESSION. “I COULDHEAR RETCHING AND GROANING AS IF I WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

THE CITY IS VISITED BY EPIDEMICSOF VIOLENCE AND THE UNTENDED DEAD ARE EATEN BY VULTURES IN THE STREET.” ALTHOUGHHE ONLY TOOK YAGÉ A FEW TIMES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT THE YAGÉ VISIONS HADA MUCH DEEPER EFFECT ON HIS FICTION THAN HIS USE OF HEROIN. HIS AMAZONIANVISIONS OF A SLEAZED-OUT “COMPOSITE CITY” BECAME THE ATMOSPHERE OF NAKED LUNCH,WRITTEN A FEW YEARS LATER, WITH ITS DISSOLUTIONS OF IDENTITY; URBAN WASTES OFFESTERING PLAGUES, SEX MANIAS, AND SADISTIC CONTROL FREAKS. EVEN THE MONTAGELIKEBREAKS THAT CHARACTERIZE HIS MATURE STYLE CALL TO MIND THE OVERLAPPINGHALLUCINATIONS OF THE AMAZONIAN BREW.THE INFINITE MURMURING VISTA OF URBAN SLEAZE AND CHEAP KICKS AND BLANK DEATHTHAT BURROUGHS DISCOVERED ON YAGÉ WAS PROBABLY NOT THE VISION HE WANTED. BUT ITWAS THE VISION HE NEEDED.. . .I THINK THAT, EVEN BEFORE I TRIED AYAHUASCA, I HAD SOME INTUITION ABOUT WHAT ITWAS. IN THE AMAZON, YAGÉ IS “THE MEDICINE,” “THE PURGE,” “THE VINE OF SOULS,”“THE ROPE OF DEATH.” IT IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT REVEALS THE AMAZONIAN INDIANCOSMOLOGY, SOURCE OF INDIGENOUS WISDOM. THE SHAMANS OF THE AMAZON SAY THAT ALLOF THEIR KNOWLEDGE, OF THE PLANTS AND THE SPIRIT WORLD, COMES FROM AYAHUASCA.WE LIVE IN A CULTURE WHERE EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED FOR OUR COMFORT ORENTERTAINMENT BUT NOTHING SATISFIES. AT OUR CORE, WE REMAIN INSATIABLE,CONSTANTLY ON THE PROWL FOR NEW COMMODITIES AND PLEASANT SENSATIONS TO FILL THEVOID. “LIFE TASTES GOOD,” PROCLAIMS AN AD FOR COCA-COLA. YAGÉ, ON THE OTHERHAND, TASTES EXTREMELY BAD. IT IS A BITTER CONCOCTION, MADE OF THE BARK OF AVINE AND THE LEAVES OF A SHRUB. THE FLAVOR IS LIKE THE DISTILLED ESSENCE OFFOREST ROT. YAGÉ DRINKERS VOMIT AND SHIT, SHIVER AND SWEAT, AND AT THE SAME TIMERECEIVE OUTRAGEOUSLY BEAUTIFUL VISIONS. THE POTION IS AN ANTIDOTE—FOLLOWINGBENJAMIN, I AM TEMPTED TO SAY A DIALECTICAL CURE—FOR OUR CURRENT CONDITION. AS AHIPSTER SHAMAN TOLD ME AT BURNING MAN, “WHITE MAN MEDICINE MAKE YOU FEEL GOODFIRST, BAD LATER. INDIAN MEDICINE MAKE YOU FEEL BAD FIRST, GOOD LATER.” MANYPEOPLE REPORT FEELING BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHICALLY RECHARGED AFTER YAGÉ. ICERTAINLY DO.I FIRST DRANK THE BREW WITH STRANGERS, WEARING ADULT DEPENDS DIAPERS AND ABLINDFOLD, SITTING IN A SMALL, DRAB APARTMENT OVERLOOKING THE EAST RIVER. NEWAGE–SOUNDING TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYED ON A TAPE DECK. INITIALLY, I SAW, AS BURROUGHSHAD, IMAGES OF GRAY SQUALOR—CORPSES LYING IN THE GUTTER OF AN ANARCHIC SLUM,PIGS GNAWING ON THEM. I HAD A MOMENTARY VISION OF BRIGHT EMERALD-GREEN VINESWAVING IN FRONT OF A BLUE WATERFALL. AFTERWARD, FOR A LONG TIME, THERE WASNOTHING ELSE. I LISTENED TO THE GASPING AND RETCHING OF THE WOMAN SITTING ACROSSFROM ME. SHE WAS HORRIBLY SICK FOR HOURS. THE GUIDES TRIED TO HELP HER, BUT TONO AVAIL.THE INDIANS REVERE AYAHUASCA FOR ITS HEALING POWERS. THE PURGING OF PARASITESAND TOXINS IS PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS. I FELT AS IF AN ALIEN INTELLIGENCEWAS COURSING THROUGH ME, EXAMINING MY ORGANS AND NERVES AND CELLULAR PROCESSES,MAKING SUBTLE ADJUSTMENTS. IT WAS LIKE I WAS A COMPUTER AND AYAHUASCA WAS APROGRAM PERFORMING SCANS AND REPAIRS. WHEN IT HAD DONE ITS WORK, I THREW UP—THEVOMITING WAS LIKE THE BEEP AT THE END OF A PROGRAM.MY THOUGHTS DRIFTED OFF. I WATCHED A SCENE TAKING PLACE WITHIN MY MIND.PARTICLES, LIKE LITTLE FLARES OF LIGHT, GATHERED INTO CLOUDS THAT FLOATEDUPWARD—WHEN THEY AROSE, THE FOCUS OF MY AWARENESS WOULD SUDDENLY SHIFT TO ADIFFERENT SUBJECT. I REALIZED I WAS WATCHING A MODEL OF THINKING, OF THENEUROCHEMICAL PROCESS OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS CREATING THOUGHTS. THESE CLOUDS WERESYNAPTIC CONCENTRATIONS, NEURAL NETS; ONE AFTER ANOTHER, THEY FLOATED TO THESURFACE OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS. WHEN THE INFORMATION REACHED A SUFFICIENT DENSITY,“I” WOULD BE PRESENTED WITH A NEW PERCEPTION.THIS VISION WAS A SMALL REVELATION. I REALIZED THAT MOST THOUGHTS ARE IMPERSONALHAPPENINGS, LIKE SELF-ASSEMBLING MACHINES. UNLESS WE TRAIN OURSELVES, THETHOUGHTS PASSING THROUGH OUR MIND HAVE LITTLE INVOLVEMENT WITH OUR WILL. IT ISSTRANGE TO REALIZE THAT EVEN OUR OWN THOUGHTS PASS BY LIKE SCENERY OUT THEWINDOW OF A BUS, A BUS WE TOOK BY ACCIDENT WHILE TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE ELSE.MOST OF THE TIME, THINKING IS AN AUTONOMOUS PROCESS, SOMETHING THAT HAPPENSOUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. THIS PERCEPTION OF THE MACHINELIKE QUALITY OF THE SELFIS SOMETHING MANY PEOPLE DISCOVER, THEN TRY TO OVERCOME, THROUGH MEDITATION.. . .AYAHUASCA IS HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED JUNGLE CHEMISTRY. THE AMAZONIAN POTION USUALLYCONSISTS OF TWO INGREDIENTS, THE BARK OF THE AYAHUASCA VINE (BANISTERIOPSISCAAPI, WHICH GROWS IN THICK DOUBLE-HELIX-SHAPED COILS AROUND RAIN FOREST TREES)AND THE LEAVES OF PSYCHOTRIA VIRIDIS OR SOME OTHER PLANT. THE VINE CONTAINS ACLASS OF PSYCHOACTIVE AND SEDATING DRUGS CALLED BETA-CARBOLINES, WHICH INCLUDESHARMINE AND HARMALINE. THE LEAVES HAVE DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE (DMT) IN THEM, AHIGHLY POTENT HALLUCINOGEN THAT IS ALSO PRODUCED WITHIN THE HUMAN BODY, FOUND INTHE BASE OF THE SPINE AND THE BRAIN. ALTHOUGH POWERFUL WHEN EXTRACTED ANDSMOKED, DMT IS NOT ORALLY ACTIVE. MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) ENZYMES IN THE GUTBREAK IT DOWN BEFORE IT REACHES THE BRAIN. YOU CAN EAT POUNDS OF THE STUFFWITHOUT FEELING ANY EFFECT. HOWEVER, THE BETA-CARBOLINES IN THE VINE ARE NATURALMAO INHIBITORS, WHICH MEANS THEY ALLOW THE DMT TO WORK. THE AYAHUASCA BREW,ACCORDING TO SANTO DAIME, A BRAZILIAN RELIGION THAT TAKES YAGÉ AS ITS SACRAMENT,IS A COMBINATION OF THE “FORCE” OF THE VINE AND THE “LIGHT” OF THE LEAVES.DMT, SMOKED ALONE, CREATES A RAPID-FIRE VISIONARY EXPERIENCE, AN OVERWHELMINGIMMERSION IN AN EXTREMELY ALIEN WORLD THAT LASTS LESS THAN TEN MINUTES. THEBETA-CARBOLINES, TAKEN ALONE, CREATE SUBTLE, MONOCHROMATIC HALLUCINATIONS THATARE SOFT, WARM, AND HUMANIZED. A FRIEND OF MINE DESCRIBED SEEING COMPASSIONATEMATERNAL FACES FLOATING ABOVE HIM AFTER A STRONG DOSE. MIXED TOGETHER IN THEAYAHUASCA BREW, THE BETA-CARBOLINES SEEM TO HAVE A PACIFYING AND HUMANIZINGEFFECT ON THE DMT VISIONS, ACTING LIKE AN INTERFACE, AND THEY STRETCH THEEXPERIENCE OUT FROM A FEW MINUTES TO A FEW HOURS. IT IS UNKNOWN HOW INDIANS,LIVING AMONG HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PLANTS IN THE FOREST, LEARNED TO COMBINETHESE BOTANICAL INGREDIENTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY BOILED TOGETHER FOR SEVERALHOURS. THE INDIANS SAY THAT THE AYAHUASCA VINE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO DO IT.. . .THE MORE I LEARNED ABOUT IT, THE MORE I WAS FASCINATED BY AYAHUASCA. EVEN THETASTE SEEMED TO CHANGE IN MY MEMORY FROM SOMETHING SIMPLY HORRIBLE TO SOMETHINGHORRIBLE THAT I YEARNED TO TASTE AGAIN. BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND IT IN NEWYORK WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. FINALLY, A YEAR AFTER THAT FIRST SESSION, I FOUNDTHE RIGHT INGREDIENTS AND COOKED UP A BREW FOR MYSELF AND TWO FRIENDS. I USEDPLANTS THAT DIFFERED FROM THE TRADITIONAL AMAZONIAN SOURCES. IN THE LASTDECADES, MANY OTHER PLANTS HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH IDENTICAL CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS,SOMETIMES IN MUCH MORE CONCENTRATED AMOUNTS. BOTANISTS HAVE DISCOVERED DMT,ESPECIALLY, IN A WIDE RANGE OF FLORA, INCLUDING SOME COMMON GRASSES. MY BREW WASMADE FROM THE REDDISH DMT-CONTAINING BARK OF MIMOSA HOSTILIS AND A BLACKPOWDERED EXTRACT OF SYRIAN RUE (PEGANUM HARMALA), A NEAR EASTERN PLANT THATPRODUCES A MIXTURE OF BETA-CARBOLINES, LIKE THE AYAHUASCA VINE. SYRIAN RUE HASAN ANCIENT HISTORY OF RITUAL USE IN THE NEAR EAST. SOME RESEARCHERS HAVESUGGESTED THAT THE REDDISH GEOMETRICAL-PATTERNED HALLUCINATIONS CAUSED BYINGESTING SYRIAN RUE MAY BE THE HISTORICAL ORIGIN OF THE PATTERNS ON ARABIANCARPETS, AS WELL AS THE SOURCE OF THE ARABIAN MYTH OF FLYING CARPETS.I FOLLOWED THE RECIPES OF JONATHAN OTT, WHOSE BOOK AYAHUASCA ANALOGUES DESCRIBESHOW TO MAKE AYAHUASCALIKE COMPOUNDS USING PLANTS FROM EVERY HEMISPHERE. “I HOPETHE SIMPLE HOME TECHNOLOGY DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK WILL DRIVE THE LAST NAIL INTOTHE COFFIN OF THE EVIL AND HYPOCRITICAL . . . CRUSADE TO ELIMINATE THIS CLASS OFDRUGS FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH,” HE WRITES IN HIS INTRODUCTION. “MAY THEENTHEOGENIC REFORMATION PREVAIL OVER THE PHARMACRATIC INQUISITION. . . .”CUTTING UP THE PLANT MATTER, GRINDING IT INTO POWDER, AND BOILING IT DOWN TOOKAN ENTIRE AFTERNOON. THE WOODSY AROMA OF THE BROTH PERMEATED THE APARTMENT.WITHIN AN HOUR OF DRINKING THE VILE STUFF, BOTH OF MY FRIENDS THREW UP VIOLENTLYAND REPEATEDLY. THEY THOUGHT I HAD POISONED THEM.SOON ENOUGH, SHUDDERING, I FOLLOWED THEM TO THE BATHROOM AND THREW UP. AFTERWARDI FELT, SPREADING THROUGH ME, A MAGNIFICENT SENSATION. I FELT CLEANSED ANDSTRONG AS THE YAGÉ OPENED MY VISIONARY CAPACITY. I LAY ON THE COUCH AS MYPSYCHIC PERISCOPE ROSE INTO THE IMAGINAL REALMS.IMAGES COILED AROUND THE SOUNDS FROM THE STEREO. WE PLAYED JAVANESE GAMELAN,RAVI SHANKAR, ORNETTE COLEMAN, BACH. THE DEAD SKIN AROUND PERCEPTION WAS PEELEDAWAY TO REVEAL NEW LEVELS OF SENSORY SUBTLETY. MUSIC WAS LIKE A PHYSICAL EVENTPERMEATING THE CELLS, OPENING NEW PATHWAYS THROUGH THE PSYCHE WITH EVERY CHANGEIN PHRASE.IMAGES CROWDED INTO MY MIND—FAINT, FRAGMENTARY, FLICKERING. I ENTERED VINYJUNGLES, SHOT THROUGH THE ABANDONED REACHES OF OUTER SPACE. PICTURES FORMED ANDDISPERSED AT HIGH SPEED. GEOMETRIC MANDALA PATTERNS APPEARED AND FADED. IWATCHED TWISTING FORMS THAT WERE TUBULAR, TENTACULAR. SUDDENLY I SEEMED TO BE ONA SPACESHIP. THE CREATURES PILOTING THE SHIP SHOOK THEIR LONG SPINDLY LIMBS ATME IN GREETING. THEY WERE PLANTLIKE, UNDULATING THEIR STALKS AND BLOSSOMS TOSHOW ME THEIR OTHERWORLD COMEDY.I REMOVED MY BLINDFOLD AND LOOKED AROUND. THE ROOM WAS SHIMMERING, PULSING WITHWAVES OF LIGHT. I FELT I WAS INSIDE THE LIQUID MATERIAL, THE FLOWING INVISIBLECURRENTS, OF MY DREAMS. THE HALLUCINATIONS SEEMED TO HAPPEN IN A PSYCHIC SPACEBETWEEN WILLING AND LETTING GO. IF I TRIED TO FORCE THE VISIONS, THEYEVAPORATED. IF I DIDN’T PURSUE THEM, THEY ALSO DISAPPEARED. THERE WAS, IREALIZED, A SKILL TO PERCEIVING THEM, AN INTERNAL EFFORT THAT REQUIRED UTILIZINGA FORM OF VISIONARY SEEING THAT WAS DISCONNECTED FROM NORMAL SIGHT.I HELD A METAPHYSICAL DIALOGUE, UNSURE IF I WAS CONVERSING WITH SOME HIGHERASPECT OF MYSELF OR THE PLANT-SPIRIT OR BOTH. I TRIED TO INTERROGATE THATELUSIVE “OTHER” ABOUT THE NATURE OF LIFE AND DEATH, THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE,THE SPIRIT REALMS. THE RESPONSE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A SUPPRESSED GIGGLE.THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME THAT HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS LIKE A FLOWER THAT BLOSSOMSFROM THE EARTH. THE STEM AND THE ROOTS ARE INVISIBLE CORDS, ETHERIC FILAMENTSTHAT LEAD BACK TO A GREATER, EXTRADIMENSIONAL BEING. OUR SEPARATION FROM THATLARGER BEING WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY ILLUSION. THE UNIVERSE WAS, WE WOULD KNOW IFWE COULD PERCEIVE ITS WORKINGS, PURPOSEFUL AND GOOD.THEN I WAS LOOKING UP FROM MY GRAVE AS DIRT WAS THROWN ON MY COFFIN. YET THISHORROR-MOVIE VANTAGE POINT DIDN’T BOTHER ME. IT MADE ME FEEL CALM.WE WERE LISTENING TO RAVI SHANKAR PLAY THE SITAR, A WOMAN SINGING WITH HIM. THEMUSIC WAS A SEDUCTIVE WHISPERING TALE. EACH SLOW MELODIC RIFF ANNOUNCED ITSELF,THEN INSINUATED ITS MESSAGE LIKE A TEASING SEXUAL POSSIBILITY. IMAGES AND IDEASLICKED OUT LIKE TONGUES OF SHAPE-SHIFTING FLAME. THERE WERE RAINBOW-TINGEDTUNNELS DRAWING ME FORWARD, VISUAL ECHOES OF CARTOON CARNIVALS, AND SIDEWAYSENTRIES TO SCHIZOID PARADISES OF PARADOX. AT THE END OF THE NIGHT I SAW, VERYCLEARLY, A MULTIARMED SHIVA DANCING BEFORE ME. HE BROKE APART INTO FLIMMERINGOCTOPUS ARMS, WRITHING PLANT FORMS. SOON AFTER THAT, THE VISIONS ENDED.THAT NIGHT, MY TWO FRIENDS HAD LITTLE TO REPORT BESIDES EXTREME NAUSEA AND ANEXPANSION OF THEIR SENSES. LATER, AFTER OTHER SUCCESSFUL AND FAILED TRIPS, IUNDERSTOOD THAT THAT IS PART OF THE DEAL WITH AYAHUASCA. COMPARED TO OTHERPSYCHEDELICS, YAGÉ’S EFFECTS ARE EXTREMELY UNPREDICTABLE, DEPENDING PERHAPS ONTHE WEATHER, THE DREAM YOU HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE, THE POSITION OF THE STARS. ITCAN UNVEIL THE SHAMANIC RAINBOW, ACCESS THE UNIVERSAL SERPENT-POWER, OR IT CANLEAVE YOU VOMITING AND VISIONLESS. IN A PERVERSE WAY, FOR ME AT LEAST, THAT ISPART OF WHAT MAKES THE BREW SO APPEALING. UNLIKE LSD OR MUSHROOMS OR ECSTASY,YAGÉ CANNOT BE COMMODIFIED OR CONSUMED RECREATIONALLY; ITS GNOSIS MUST BEEARNED."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22MY SHAMANIC VACATION[images/00006.jpg] IN OCTOBER 2000, TWO MONTHS AFTER BURNING MAN, I VISITED THESECOYA INDIANS, A SMALL TRIBE OF 750 IN THE ECUADOREAN AMAZON. THE SECOYA LIVEON THE RIO AGUARICO, A RIVER WINDING THROUGH THE LARGEST UNROADED STRETCH OFRAIN FOREST LEFT IN THE WORLD. LATER I LEARNED THAT THE SECOYA ARE RESPECTEDAMONG THE NEIGHBORING INDIAN GROUPS FOR THE PURITY OF THEIR AYAHUASCA TRADITION.LIKE MANY AMAZONIAN TRIBES, THE SECOYA HAVE BEEN DECIMATED OVER THE LAST CENTURYBY DISEASE AND FORCED ACCULTURATION. THEIR LAST GREAT SHAMAN IS DON CAESARIO, ASMALL AND FRAIL MAN IN HIS EIGHTIES.“THE SECOYA CULTURE IS BASED ON COMMUNION WITH THE ‘HEAVENLY PEOPLE’ WHO LIVEALONG THE RIVER AND IN THE SKY,” SAID JONATHON, THE ETHNOBOTANIST WHO ORGANIZEDMY TRIP. “THEY DRINK YAGÉ TO SEE THEM.”DON CAESARIO USUALLY MAINTAINED THE DISTANCED BUT REGAL DEMEANOR OF SOMEONE WITHCOMMAND OVER THE DEEP MYSTICAL REALMS. HE RESEMBLED A HIGH TIBETAN LAMA, WITHASIATIC FEATURES AND THE LARGE EARS OF THE SPIRITUALLY ADVANCED. HE WAS OFTENSEATED QUIETLY ON A HAMMOCK, WEARING CRISSCROSSING NECKLACES MADE FROM PAINTEDSEEDS, A KNEE-LENGTH WHITE TUNIC, AND A YELLOW CROWN—THE TRADITIONAL GARB OF THESECOYA.ON MY FIRST MORNING IN THE JUNGLE, DON CAESARIO STOOD INCHES AWAY FROM ME IN ALONG DUGOUT CANOE. HE DID NOT RADIATE CALM. HE WAS SHAKING WITH RAGE,BRANDISHING A LOADED SHOTGUN. A FEW DAYS AGO, DON CAESARIO’S PERSONAL CANOE ANDOUTBOARD MOTOR—WORTH ABOUT $4,000, A LIFETIME’S WAGES FOR THE AVERAGE SECOYA—HADBEEN STOLEN. THE SHAMAN DEMANDED VENGEANCE.THE EXPEDITION INCLUDED A GROUP OF MALE SECOYAS RANGING FROM ELDERS TO YOUNGBOYS. ALSO A FEW OF THE ASSISTANTS EMPLOYED BY SENTIENT EXPERIENTIALS, THE TOURGROUP, AS WELL AS FOUR FOOLISH TOURISTS INCLUDING MYSELF. AT THE HELM OF THEBOAT, JOHN BELLA, A GUNG-HO RAIN FOREST ACTIVIST AND JUNIOR MEMBER OF THESENTIENT STAFF, HELD A HUNTING RIFLE THAT I HOPED HE WOULDN’T TRY TO USE. THESENTIENT STAFF WAS A NEBULOUS GROUP THAT INCLUDED A HEALER FROM CALIFORNIA, ASULLEN MASSEUSE FROM COLOMBIA, A SHAGGY-BEARDED COOK, OTHERS WHOSE ROLES I NEVERFIGURED OUT, AND SOME QUECHUA INDIANS. ALSO TRAVELING WITH US WAS PABLOAMARINGO, A PAINTER KNOWN FOR HIS WONDERFUL AND INTRICATE RENDERINGS OFAYAHUASCA VISIONS. A GENTLE MAN AND ART TEACHER, AMARINGO HAD BEEN A PERUVIANAYAHUASQUERO FOR MANY YEARS, DRINKING YAGÉ EVERY DAY. HE SAID HE STARTED TO HAVEVISIONS OF A WITCH WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM EVERY TIME HE TOOK YAGÉ. HEREALIZED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO KILL HER IF HE WANTED TO REMAIN A SHAMAN. HEDECIDED TO GIVE UP HIS PRACTICE INSTEAD.I WAS SITTING NEXT TO MARK MILLER, A PSYCHOLOGIST IN A TIE-DYED T-SHIRT.“WHAT AM I DOING HERE?” MARK ASKED, AS THE CANOE CHURNED THE WATERS OF THEAGUARICO RIVER, A MUDDY CHANNEL FLOWING FROM ECUADOR TO COLOMBIA. “I’VE GOT AWIFE AND BABY BACK HOME.”DON CAESARIO RAISED HIS GUN. IN SPANISH HE SHOUTED, “I WILL KILL THE THIEVESWHEN I FIND THEM.”MARK AND I HAD BEEN INVITED ALONG BY JONATHON MILLER-WEISBERGER, ABERKELEY-BORN, ECUADOR-RAISED, JEWISH BOTANIST WITH A PENCHANT FOR QUOTING THETAO. HE HAD ORGANIZED THIS TOUR. HE WAS ALSO THE FOUNDER OF GRUPO OSANIMI, ANORGANIZATION THAT WORKS ON CULTURAL-REVIVAL PROJECTS WITH ECUADOREAN TRIBES.MOST OF THE PROFITS FROM THIS TRIP WOULD GO TO BENEFIT GRUPO OSANIMI’S PROJECTS.DURING OUR TWO WEEKS IN THE JUNGLE, JONATHON WANTED US TO GET A FULL DOSE OFAMAZONIAN LIFE. HE EXPLAINED THAT THEFT ALONG THE AGUARICO, ONCE ALMOST UNHEARDOF, WAS BECOMING COMMON AS CONDITIONS DETERIORATED: MESTIZOS WERE SETTLING ONISOLATED PLOTS OF LAND BETWEEN THE TERRITORIES BELONGING TO THE SIONA, THESECOYA, AND THE QUECHUA. THEY EKED OUT A LIVING BY GROWING COFFEE BEANS ANDCORN, AND THE MOST UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEINDIANS.MEANWHILE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS POURING $1.5 BILLION INTO PLAN COLOMBIA,MAKING WAR ON THE GUERRILLAS, AND ATTEMPTING TO ANNIHILATE THE COCA FIELDSHIDDEN ALONG THE ECUADOREAN-COLOMBIAN BORDER. FROM PLANES, THEY WERE SPRAYINGMASSIVE AMOUNTS OF ROUND-UP, A DEADLY POISONOUS HERBICIDE DEVELOPED BY MONSANTO,THAT APPARENTLY LAID WASTE TO LARGE SWATHES OF THE JUNGLE, DESTROYINGUNCOUNTABLE SPECIES INCLUDING AYAHUASCA—AND POISONING THE FISH IN THE RIVERS,ACCORDING TO THE INDIANS. IT WAS UNKNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT THE UNDERGROUND COCAINDUSTRY WAS DAMAGED BY THIS INDISCRIMINATE ECO-CIDE. THE SECOYA FEAREDCOLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS SNEAKING INTO ECUADOR—IN FACT, THE GUERRILLAS MAY HAVESTOLEN THE CANOE. TO ADD TO THE ANXIETY, WE WERE IN A REGION WHERE DESPERADOESHAD BEEN KIDNAPPING AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OIL-COMPANY WORKERS WITH ALARMINGREGULARITY. THE TENSION THICKENED TO MATCH THE EQUATORIAL HUMIDITY AS WE SCANNEDTHE SILENT, STICKY JUNGLE FOR ENEMIES.AFTER SEVERAL HOURS WE CAME UPON THE CANOE CHAINED IN FRONT OF A RAMSHACKLEHOMESTEAD. A PATH FROM THE RIVERBANK LED UP TO THATCHED HUTS SHADED BY THE SHINYLEAVES OF COFFEE BUSHES. FAMILIES—A FEW SCARED MEN, MOTHERS, CHILDREN, BLACKS,AND MESTIZOS IN CHEAP WESTERN CLOTHES—WATCHED US HESITANTLY FROM THE SHORE. ITWAS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THEIR FACES. WERE THEY GUILTY AND ASHAMED? CUNNING ANDDECEITFUL? WERE OTHER SETTLERS, RIFLES DRAWN, TARGETING US FROM BEHIND THETREES?DON CAESARIO AND SOME OF THE SECOYA JUMPED INTO THE CANOE AND CUT IT LOOSE.HEATED WORDS WERE EXCHANGED. THE SHAMAN’S LIPS TREMBLED IN FURY AS HE RAISED HISSHOTGUN AND POINTED IT AT THE FRIGHTENED LEADERS OF THE HOMESTEADERS.MARK AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. WE WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN OUR SHAMAN’S SIGHT LINEAND HIS ENEMIES. IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE A SAFE PLACE TO BE.JONATHON LEAPT OUT OF THE BOAT AND STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE SETTLERS. THE SECOYAGUNNED THE MOTOR AND PILOTED DON CAESARIO AWAY. SHOTS RANG OUT—THE SOUND OF OURSPIRITUAL LEADER EMPTYING HIS CHAMBERS INTO THE AIR.WE MET JONATHON IN QUITO, ECUADOR’S CAPITAL, WHERE THE COUNTRY’S SUDDEN SWITCHTO A U.S.-DOLLAR ECONOMY, DUE TO AN IMF-ENGINEERED DEBT CRISIS, WAS SPURRINGMASSIVE INFLATION AND RIOTS. OUR GROUP WAS BOOKED AT CASA DEL SOL, A SMALL HOTELSTAFFED BY QUECHUA INDIANS, ON AVENIDA JOSÉ CALAMA. CALAMA WAS TURISTA CENTRAL,A STREET OF HOTELS, BARS, AND HOSTELS. RECENTLY WIRED TO THE NET, IT WAS HOME TOAN ALARMING NUMBER OF NEW CYBER CAFES—POOL.NET [http://www.pool.net], PAPAYA.NET[http://www.papaya.net], EARTH.NET [http://www.earth.net]— BLARING POP MUSIC ANDSELLING MULTIHUED FRUIT DRINKS. YOUNG BACKPACKERS, RANGING FROM THE HIP ANDDREADLOCKED TO THE PREPPY AND GENERIC, SAT BEFORE BANKS OF TERMINALS, E-MAILINGTHEIR FRIENDS BACK HOME ABOUT THEIR ROMANTIC HOOK-UPS, VISA PROBLEMS, ANDSTOMACHACHES. BUT THE MULTICULTURAL BUZZ OF THE CAFES WAS MUTED BY THEBLACK-UNIFORMED GUARDS WHO STOOD IN THE STREET WITH DOGS AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONS,PROTECTING THE GRINGOS FROM THE EVER-PRESENT THREAT OF KIDNAPPERS AND THIEVES.JONATHON HAD RENTED A BUS TO TAKE US FROM QUITO. WE DROVE THROUGH THE CLOUDFORESTS OF THE ANDES, DESCENDING INTO THE AMAZON IN A BUMPY TWELVE-HOUR RIDE.THIS RIDE TATTOOED ON OUR EYEBALLS THE DEVASTATION WROUGHT BY THE OIL INDUSTRY.THE ROADS BUILT BY THE OIL COMPANIES HAD OPENED UP THE JUNGLE TO LOGGERS ANDPOOR, DESPERATE MESTIZO SETTLERS. ALL THOUGHTS OF VISIONARY INDIANS AND MYSTICREVELATIONS WERE WIPED AWAY BY THE BLUNT REALITY OF THE PIPELINE RUNNINGINEXORABLY BESIDE THE ROAD, SURROUNDED BY RECENTLY CLEAR-CUT LAND, LIKE A SNAKESUCKING THE MARROW OUT OF THE JUNGLE.WE SPENT THE NIGHT AT LAGO AGRIO, THE DODGE CITY OF ECUADOR, POPULATION 25,000AND GROWING. IT WAS A RAGGED BOOMTOWN OF TWO INDUSTRIES: OIL AND PROSTITUTION.TEN YEARS AGO, THE AREA WAS VIRGIN RAIN FOREST; NOW IT WAS SLASHED-AND-BURNTSCRUB. ONCE IT IS DESTROYED, THE RAIN FOREST DOES NOT REGENERATE, AND THE LOCALCLIMATE QUICKLY BECOMES TOO HOT AND DRY FOR FARMING. THE LAND, FOR ALL PRACTICALPURPOSES, BECOMES USELESS.OUR BUS DRIVER AND HIS BUDDY RETURNED WITH SHEEPISH GRINS FROM A NIGHT ON THETOWN. THEY BRAGGED ABOUT THE TEENAGE PROSTITUTES WHO COULD BE HAD FOR TWODOLLARS AT THE LOCAL WHOREHOUSES. I THOUGHT OF THE CHAIN OF DEHUMANIZATION ANDEXPLOITATION BEGINNING WITH THE OIL COMPANY’S QUEST FOR PROFIT, THE AMERICANCONSUMER’S AVIDITY FOR CHEAP GAS TO FUEL SUVS, THE CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS OFBANKRUPT THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES SEEKING PAYOFFS, ENDING WITH DESPOILED RAINFORESTS AND TEENAGE MESTIZO GIRLS CONTRACTING AIDS FROM DRUNK DITCH DIGGERS INTHIRD WORLD BACKWATERS. BENJAMIN’S “RELIGION OF DESTRUCTION” WAS PERFORMING ITSGOOD WORKS.THE NEXT DAY WE RODE FOR FOUR HOURS ON MOTORIZED CANOES, ON THE MUD-BROWN RIOAGUARICO, EVER-DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE, SURROUNDED BY ITS SECRETIVE GREENDENSITY. WE PASSED THROUGH THE TERRITORIES OF NEIGHBORING INDIAN TRIBES. ASNIGHT FELL, WE WERE BROUGHT TO THE ROUGH STONE STEPS LEADING UP TO THE HOUSE OFDON CAESARIO.. . .OVER THE LAST 300 YEARS, THE SECOYA HAVE LOST THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND AND 98PERCENT OF THEIR POPULATION. DECIMATED BY THE DISEASES OF THE SPANISHCONQUERORS, ENSLAVED AND FORCED TO WORK ON RUBBER PLANTATIONS, A TRIBE OF MORETHAN 30,000 HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A PALTRY 750. ALMOST HALF LIVE ON THE RIOAGUARICO, THE REST IN THE REMOTE JUNGLES OF PERU.ACROSS THE AMAZON, INDIAN CULTURES HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED AND QUICKLY DESTROYEDTHROUGH CONTACT WITH THE WEST. VAST TREASURES OF BOTANICAL KNOWLEDGE ANDLINGUISTIC AND SPIRITUAL TRADITIONS ARE ALREADY GONE. AS THE FORCE OF THECOLONIALISTS AND THEIR CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES OVERWHELMED THE INDIANS, FOLLOWEDBY RUTHLESS RUBBER TAPPERS AND THEN EVEN MORE RUTHLESS OIL CORPORATIONS, THETRIBAL SHAMANS LOST THEIR AUTHORITY. MANY WERE ACCUSED, OFTEN BY MISSIONARIES,OF WITCHCRAFT. SHAMANS HAVE EVEN BEEN MURDERED BY INDIANS LOOKING FOR SCAPEGOATSTO BLAME FOR THE COLLAPSE OF THEIR WORLD.IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, SHAMANS HAVE BEEN REAPPROPRIATED AS HEROICFIGURES BY ANTHROPOLOGISTS, PSYCHEDELIC AVATARS LIKE TERENCE MCKENNA, AND NEWAGE POPULISTS. BUT THE FACT IS THAT AMBIGUITY HOVERS OVER SHAMANISM WHEREVER ITAPPEARS. THE MAGICAL POWERS ACQUIRED THROUGH DISCIPLINED USE OF AYAHUASCA CAN BETURNED TO GOOD OR EVIL. THE YAGÉ DRINKER IS THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE FAMOUSSECOYA SHAMAN FERNANDO PAYAGUAJE, COMPILED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH HIS GRANDSONS.PAYAGUAJE SPOKE ABOUT THE TEMPTATION OF SORCERY: “SOME PEOPLE DRINK YAGÉ ONLY TOTHE POINT OF REACHING THE POWER TO PRACTICE WITCHCRAFT; WITH THESE CRAFTS THEYCAN KILL PEOPLE. A MUCH GREATER EFFORT AND CONSUMPTION OF YAGÉ ARE REQUIRED TOREACH THE HIGHEST LEVEL, WHERE ONE GAINS ACCESS TO THE VISIONS AND POWERS OFHEALING.” MICHAEL HARNER, STUDYING THE SHAMANISM OF THE JIVARO (OR SHUAR)INDIANS OF THE AMAZON, NOTED THAT JIVARO SHAMANS WIELDED MAGICAL DARTS,TSENTSAK, THAT COULD BE USED EITHER TO CURE OR KILL. THE JIVARO, LIKE MOSTTRIBAL GROUPS, LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF WITCHCRAFT. SORCERY IS THE INESCAPABLESHADOW SIDE OF SHAMANISM.THE MODERN WEST, ENGAGED IN A NEOSHAMANIC RENAISSANCE, HAS SO FAR IGNORED THEAMBIGUOUS ASPECTS OF SHAMANISM. THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST MICHAEL F. BROWNFINDS IT UNSETTLING “THAT NEW AGE AMERICA SEEKS TO EMBRACE SHAMANISM WITHOUT ANYAPPRECIATION OF ITS CONTEXT. FOR MY SANTA FE ACQUAINTANCES, TRIBAL LORE IS ASUPERMARKET FROM WHICH THEY CHOOSE SOME TIDBITS WHILE SPURNING OTHERS.” AMONGTHE INDIANS, “SHAMANISM AFFIRMS LIFE BUT ALSO SPAWNS VIOLENCE AND DEATH. THEBEAUTY OF SHAMANISM IS MATCHED BY ITS POWER—AND LIKE ALL FORMS OF POWER FOUND INSOCIETY, IT INSPIRES ITS SHARE OFDISCONTENT.”WESTERNERS WHO HAVE REDISCOVERED MAGIC AND SPIRIT AS LIVING FACTS OF HUMANEXISTENCE, TRANSFORMED IN THEIR OWN INNER BEING BY THE KNOWLEDGE, YEARN TOREINTRODUCE THESE FORCES TO THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD. YET THESE ELEMENTAL FORCESCANNOT BE DIVORCED FROM AMBIGUITY, FROM DANGER. MAGIC SHADES INTO WITCHCRAFT,COMMUNICATING WITH THE SPIRIT REALM IS A STEP AWAY FROM OCCULT INVOCATION.BRINGING THIS KNOWLEDGE BACK INTO CONTEMPORARY LIFE REQUIRES RECKONING WITH DARKFORCES, A DELICATE BALANCING ACT THAT IS INTRINSIC TO SHAMANISM.“AYAHUASCA TOURISM,” A GROWING PHENOMENON THROUGHOUT SOUTH AMERICA, REFLECTS THESURGE OF UNDERGROUND INTEREST IN AYAHUASCA IN THE UNITED STATES. PRECISE FIGURESARE HARD TO COME BY, BUT ONE COULD ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SHAMANS,RANGING FROM AUTHENTIC TO AMBIGUOUS TO FRAUDULENT, RECEIVING THOUSANDS OFWESTERN VISITORS ANNUALLY. WEBSITES DEVOTED TO THE VINE KEEP MULTIPLYING, ALONGWITH NEW BOOKS: THE COSMIC SERPENT, BY JEREMY NARBY; AYAHUASCA: HUMANCONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SPIRITS OF NATURE, EDITED BY RALPH METZNER; AND AYAHUASCAVISIONS, BY PABLO AMARINGO AND EDUARDO LUNA, TO NAME ONLY A FEW. MAGAZINES LIKESHAMAN’S DRUM PROMOTE GROUP TOURS TO VISIT MESTIZO SHAMANS ACROSS THE AMAZON FORA FEW WEEKS OF FASTING AND “JOURNEYING.”SOME CRITICS ATTACK THESE EXCURSIONS FOR MARKETING NATIVE SPIRITUALITY ANDFURTHER DEGRADING AMAZONIAN TRADITIONS. THE ANTHROPOLOGIST MARLENE DOBKIN DERIOS, AUTHOR OF VISIONARY VINE, A BOOK ON YAGÉ HEALING IN PERU, BELIEVES THATAMERICANS ARE DRIVEN TO SHAMANIC ADVENTURES BY THE SYNDROME OF THE “EMPTY SELF,”THE INNER VOID LEFT BY OUR MATERIALISTIC CULTURE. IN THE INTRODUCTION TO HISBOOK AYAHUASCA ANALOGUES, JONATHAN OTT BEMOANS AYAHUASCA TOURISM IN THE AMAZON,“WHICH CAN ONLY DISRUPT THE EVANESCENT REMNANT OF PRELITERATE RELIGIOSITYSTRUGGLING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR ITSELF IN THE MODERN WORLD, WHILE ATTRACTING THEWRONG KIND OF POLITICAL ATTENTION TO AYAHUASCA.”IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE PERSPECTIVES ARE SHORTSIGHTED, NOT ONLY BECAUSE THESHAMANS THEMSELVES HAVE THE VISION OF SHARING THEIR KNOWLEDGE WITH WESTERNERS,BUT ALSO BECAUSE YAGÉ TOURISM, IF IT IS DONE CONSCIENTIOUSLY, IS A FORCE THATCAN HELP TO PRESERVE INDIGENOUS TRADITIONS AT THIS POINT. THIS IS WHAT SEEMS TOBE HAPPENING WITH THE SECOYA. THERE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ANY “PURE” INDIANCULTURES ANYMORE, CERTAINLY NO ILLITERATE ONES. AFTER DECADES OF SEEING THEIRCULTURES TRASHED BY MISSIONARIES, ASSAULTED BY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS, OVERRUN BYCORPORATE GREED, THE INDIANS NEED TO KNOW THAT CERTAIN GROUPS OF RICH WESTERNERSVALUE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND HISTORY. THE YAGÉ TOURS ARE, IN FACT, BENEFICIAL TOBOTH SIDES: THE SHAMANS DESPERATELY NEED THE REVENUE, AND WE, EQUALLYDESPERATELY, NEED THE REVELATIONS.SENTIENT EXPERIENTIALS DID NOT EXPLICITLY USE YAGÉ TO PROMOTE THEIR JOURNEYS TOSECOYA TERRITORY. DON CAESARIO WAS NOT PAID FOR HIS SHAMANISM; INSTEAD, HE WASCOMPENSATED FOR HIS HOSPITALITY WITH GIFTS, SUCH AS HIS HOUSE AND CANOE.BEHOLDEN TO NO ONE, HE COULD SKIP THE CEREMONIES ENTIRELY IF HE DID NOT LIKE THEATTITUDE OF THE GROUP.I FERVENTLY HOPED HE WOULDN’T DO THAT TO US.. . .AFTER THE RECOVERY OF THE BOAT, WE SETTLED IN FOR A TWELVE-DAY STAY. THE WOMENSET UP TENTS WHILE MOST OF THE MEN SLEPT ON HAMMOCKS UNDER THE SHAMAN’S THATCHEDROOF, WHERE THE ELDERS AND AN EVER-ROTATING NUMBER OF SECOYA FAMILIES ALSOLIVED. SEVERAL TIMES I RETURNED TO MY HAMMOCK IN THE AFTERNOON TO FIND A TINYBABY SLEEPING IN IT.AMONG OUR GROUP OF HOPEFUL PSYCHONAUTS, THE LARGEST CONTINGENT, SURPRISINGLY,WAS MADE UP OF FEISTY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN—SOCIAL WORKERS, THERAPISTS, ACADEMICS,AND HOUSEWIVES—SOME WHITE-HAIRED, MOST WEARING FANNY PACKS AND TEVAS. TWO WEREGRADUATES OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF INTEGRAL STUDIES, A KIND OF NEW AGETHINK TANK. THERE WAS ALSO OCTAVIA MARTIN, A PENSIVE NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIST WHOLIVED ON A RESERVATION IN MASSACHUSETTS. WE DID NOT SEEM LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR ATREK INTO THE DEEP JUNGLE; OUR CAMPSITE WAS A THREE-HOUR CANOE TRIP AWAY FROM APHONE OR HOSPITAL. I WAS ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT ANNIE BUSH, A PSYCHOTHERAPISTWHOSE LARGE BODY SUGGESTED THE SOFT EXCESSES OF SUBURBAN LIVING (LATER SHEOUTHIKED ME THROUGH THE FOREST). THERE WERE TWO OTHER GUYS IN THEIR THIRTIESFOLLOWING A PERSONAL “VISION QUEST.”“I DO WHAT THE GREAT SPIRIT TELLS ME TO DO,” SAID MARK, THE THERAPIST, ONLYHALF-JOKING. HE HAD GONE ON A THOUSAND-MILE PEYOTE HUNT, THE ANNUAL RITE OF THEHUICHOL INDIANS IN MEXICO, WITH A HUICHOL SHAMANESS. NERVOUS ABOUT YAGÉ, HECALLED TAKING PSYCHEDELICS “GOING INTO ‘THE MYSTERY.’ ”ANDREW DOXER, A RAIL-THIN TEACHER IN A BOSTON AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM, REGULARLYVISITED A MESTIZO SHAMAN IN PERU TO TAKE YAGÉ AND FAST. HE WANTED TO FOLLOW THE“SHAMANIC PATH.” THE FIRST TIME HE DRANK THE BREW, ANDREW SAID, HE SAW A VISIBLECURRENT OF ENERGY FLOW UP INTO HIM FROM THE FLOOR. HE REALIZED, IN A FLASH, THATHE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH CHILDREN. AFTER THAT, HE STOPPED HAVING VISIONS, WHICHWAS FRUSTRATING. YET HE WAS READY FOR ANOTHER DOSE.OUR GROUP ALSO INCLUDED TAMARA SWINGLE, A CHEERFUL TWENTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD BOTANYSTUDENT FROM WASHINGTON STATE, SMALL, BLOND, AND MUSCULAR. JOHN EMERSON, AWELL-TRAVELED BEEKEEPER FROM HAWAII, LOOKED LIKE A SPY FROM A GRAHAM GREENENOVEL IN HIS PANAMA HAT AND KHAKI SUIT. JEAN-MICHEL TAUB, A FRENCH BUSINESSMAN,REMINDED ME OF PEPE LE PEU, THE INSUFFERABLE FRENCH SKUNK FROM WARNER BROS.CARTOONS. WHILE MOCKING AMERICAN CONSUMERISM, JEAN-MICHEL BROUGHT A HANDHELDGLOBAL-POSITIONING DEVICE TO THE JUNGLE. (HE OFFERED TO EXPLAIN ITS WORKINGS TODON CAESARIO: “NO, THANKS,” THE SHAMAN REPLIED GRUFFLY. “I ALREADY KNOW WHERE IAM.”)ALMOST INSTANTLY, OUR GROUP STARTED TO SUCCUMB TO THE JUNGLE CONDITIONS. ON THESECOND DAY, TAMMY, SEEMINGLY THE FITTEST OF US ALL, CAUGHT A RAGING STOMACH BUG.HAE SOOG JO, A KOREAN ACADEMIC FROM BERKELEY, DEVELOPED A SEVERE INFECTION ONHER FOOT. A FEW OTHERS BUMBLED INTO A HIVE AND WERE ATTACKED BY ANGRY BEES. THECASUALTIES CREPT BACK TO THEIR TENTS OR HAMMOCKS, WHERE THEY LAY, DAZED BY THEINTENSE MIDDAY HEAT, MAKING THE REST OF US FEEL LUCKY."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23MEET THE SNAKE[images/00006.jpg] JEREMY NARBY WAS A YOUNG ANTHROPOLOGIST STUDYING THEASHANINCA INDIANS IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON WHEN HE FIRST TOOK AYAHUASCA IN THEMID-1980S. THE INDIANS HAD TOLD HIM THAT AYAHUASCA WAS THE SOURCE OF THEIR PLANTKNOWLEDGE. THEY CALLED IT “FOREST TELEVISION.” NARBY WAS INTERESTED, THOUGHSKEPTICAL.HE WAS LESS SKEPTICAL AN HOUR AFTER DRINKING THE BREW, WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELFSURROUNDED BY TWO HUGE SNAKES, FIFTY-FOOT BOAS, WHO SPOKE TELEPATHICALLY TO HIM,PUTTING HIM IN HIS PLACE: “THEY EXPLAIN THAT I AM JUST A HUMAN BEING. I FEEL MYMIND CRACK, AND IN THE FISSURES, I SEE THE BOTTOMLESS ARROGANCE OF MYPRESUPPOSITIONS. IT IS PROFOUNDLY TRUE THAT I AM JUST A HUMAN BEING, AND, MOSTOF THE TIME, I HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING, WHEREAS HERE IFIND MYSELF IN A MORE POWERFUL REALITY THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL AND THAT,IN MY ARROGANCE, I DID NOT EVEN SUSPECT EXISTED.” LATER, THE SHAMAN TELLS HIMTHE SNAKES ARE KNOWN AS “THE MOTHER OF AYAHUASCA.”AYAHUASCA, AS RALPH METZNER NOTED, IS A “GNOSTIC CATALYST.” IT OPENS THE DOOR TOTHOSE OCCULT DIMENSIONS OF PSYCHIC REALITY THAT ARE VIGOROUSLY DENIED BY MODERNRATIONALISM. LIKE MICHAEL HARNER A GENERATION EARLIER, NARBY FOUND HIMSELFFORCED TO REEVALUATE HIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL STANCE AND HIS OWN BELIEFS AFTERDRINKING YAGÉ. HIS BOOK, THE COSMIC SERPENT, IS AN ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET THEVISIONARY REALMS OPENED BY AYAHUASCA IN A WAY THAT MIGHT FIT WITH A SCIENTIFICWORLDVIEW. HE FINDS THAT THE MOTIF OF SNAKES, ESPECIALLY TWIN SERPENTS—THECADUCEUS OF HERMES AND THE SIGN OF WESTERN MEDICINE—APPEARS WORLDWIDE IN ARCHAICMYTHS OF CREATION, AND AS KUNDALINI, THE HINDU OCCULT SYMBOL OF THE LIFE FORCE.NARBY LINKS THE SERPENT OR TANGLED SNAKES OFTEN BEHELD THROUGH AYAHUASCA WITHTHE TWISTED AND TWINNED COILS OF DNA. HE THEORIZES, “IN THEIR VISIONS SHAMANSMANAGE TO TAKE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS DOWN TO THE MOLECULAR LEVEL.” SHAMANS,ACCORDING TO NARBY, RECEIVE IMAGES AND INFORMATION FROM DNA. DNA, A SNAKELIKESTRING OF CODED DATA, IS ALSO AN APERIODIC CRYSTAL, FOUR ATOMS WIDE, THAT BEAMSOUT PHOTONS. “THE GLOBAL NETWORK OF DNA-BASED LIFE EMITS ULTRA-WEAK RADIO WAVES,WHICH ARE CURRENTLY AT THE LIMIT OF MEASUREMENT, BUT WHICH WE CAN NONETHELESSPERCEIVE . . . IN HALLUCINATIONS AND IN DREAMS,” HE WRITES. HE THEORIZES THATTHIS TRANSMISSION IS THE “VEGETABLE GNOSIS” AND COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THENATURAL WORLD.DETOURING INTO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, NARBY EXPLORES GENETICS AND THE DARWINIANTHEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION. HE FINDS THAT DARWIN’S THEORY DOES NOT SEEM TO FITTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GENETIC CODE, AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX LANGUAGE PACKAGEDWITH A HIGH-TECH TRANSCRIPTION PROGRAM THAT APPEARED WITH THE FIRST BACTERIA 3.5BILLION YEARS AGO. THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION ALSO HAS TO BE STRETCHED TOEXPLAIN THE SUDDEN EXPLOSION OF ANIMAL SPECIES THAT STARTED 543 MILLION YEARS INTHE PAST.“THROUGHOUT THE FOSSIL RECORD, SPECIES SEEM TO APPEAR SUDDENLY, FULLY FORMED ANDEQUIPPED WITH ALL SORTS OF SPECIALIZED ORGANS, THEN REMAIN STABLE FOR MILLIONSOF YEARS,” NARBY WRITES. OTHER PSYCHEDELIC AVATARS SHARE NARBY’S SUSPICION THATWHAT IS GOING ON IN EVOLUTION IS MORE THAN THE RESULT OF ENDLESS CHEMICALREACTIONS. AS PIONEERING LSD PSYCHOANALYST STANISLAV GROF WROTE, “THEPROBABILITY THAT HUMAN INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED ALL THE WAY FROM THE CHEMICAL OOZEOF THE PRIMEVAL OCEAN SOLELY THROUGH RANDOM SEQUENCES OF RANDOM MECHANICALPROCESSES HAS BEEN APTLY COMPARED TO THE PROBABILITY OF A TORNADO BLOWINGTHROUGH A GIGANTIC JUNKYARD AND ASSEMBLING BY ACCIDENT A 747 JUMBO JET.”EVEN FRANCIS CRICK, ONE OF THE DISCOVERERS OF THE DNA DOUBLE HELIX, FOUND ITNECESSARY TO ADVANCE THE THESIS THAT THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ORGANIC LIFE ARRIVEDON METEORITES TO EXPLAIN HOW THE GENE CODE COULD HAVE DEVELOPED. OF COURSE, LIKETHE THEORY THAT EXTRATERRESTRIALS BRED US FOR EXPERIMENTATION, SUCH A HYPOTHESISRESOLVES NOTHING AND ONLY ADDS TO THE MYSTERY.NARBY SUGGESTS THAT THE SCIENTIFIC ADHERENCE TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTIONIS A FORM OF FAITH. HIS BOOK FALLS WITHIN “THE BLIND SPOT OF THE RATIONAL ANDFRAGMENTED GAZE OF CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY.” AGAINST THE POSTULATES OF REDUCTIVEMATERIALISM, NARBY BELIEVES THAT “DNA IN PARTICULAR AND NATURE IN GENERAL AREMINDED. THIS CONTRAVENES THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLE OF THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY THAT ISTHE CURRENT ORTHODOXY.” HE SUSPECTS THAT THE AYAHUASCA VINE MAY BE EXACTLY WHATTHE SHAMANS SAY IT IS: THE SENTIENT SPIRIT OF NATURE, THE MIND OF THE FOREST,WHICH DIRECTLY COMMUNICATES WITH HUMAN BEINGS THROUGH THIS CHEMICAL INTERFACE.NARBY MAKES A LAUDABLE EFFORT TO STUDY AYAHUASCA BY ACCEPTING THAT THEAYAHUASQUEROS POSSESS REAL KNOWLEDGE, RATHER THAN ASSUMING, AS MOST WESTERNERSHAVE FOR CENTURIES, THAT THE SHAMANS WERE EITHER SCHIZOPHRENIC, DELUDED, FAKERS,OR AT BEST FABULATORS. IT IS INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT SHAMANIC PRACTICES HAVEVALIDITY—FOR HEALING, FOR SPIRITUAL REGENERATION, AND TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION,AMONG OTHERS. IT REMAINS DIFFICULT FOR SCIENTISTS TO APPROACH THE SUBJECTRATIONALLY BECAUSE SHAMANS WORK WITH INVISIBLE PSYCHIC CURRENTS, “SUPERSENSIBLE”FORCES, AND THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH FORCES, SUCH AS THE SUBTLE CURRENTS RECOGNIZEDBY EASTERN TRADITIONS, ARE BEYOND THE PERIMETERS OF WHAT OUR TOOLS CAN MEASUREAT THIS POINT. THE EXISTENCE OF WHAT CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED IS NOT ONLY IGNOREDBUT VEHEMENTLY DENIED BY WESTERN SCIENTISTS, WHO FORGET THAT “ABSENCE OFEVIDENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE.” HOW CAN THE RATIONAL PERSPECTIVE OF THEWEST COMPREHEND A TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES USE OF INVISIBLE AND SEEMINGLYUNMEASURABLE FORCES? THAT WILL BE A SUBJECT FOR THE NEW CENTURY TO EXPLORE. ASTERENCE MCKENNA WROTE, “SHAMANS SPEAK OF ‘SPIRIT’ THE WAY A QUANTUM PHYSICISTMIGHT SPEAK OF ‘CHARM’; IT IS A TECHNICAL GLOSS FOR A VERY COMPLICATED CONCEPT.”THE COSMIC SERPENT IS ONLY ONE OF MANY RECENT EFFORTS BY WESTERN THINKERS TOREINTERPRET THE MEANING OF AYAHUASCA SHAMANISM FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER. INSHAMANISM, COLONIALISM, AND THE WILD MAN, ANTHROPOLOGIST MICHAEL TAUSSIGINTERPRETS YAGÉ SHAMANISM IN COLOMBIA, WHERE ANCIENT RITUALS HAVE TAKEN ON NEWMEANINGS IN THE WAKE OF THE CRUEL EXCESSES OF COLONIALISM. TAUSSIG’S INDIGENOUSSORCERERS EXORCISE THE LEGACY OF COLONIALIST TERROR THROUGH LAUGHTER ANDIMPROVISATION, “BUILDING AND REBUILDING NEOCOLONIAL HEALING RITUALS WHEREIN FATEIS WRESTED FROM THE HANDS OF GOD AND TRANSCRIBED INTO A DOMAIN OF CHANCE ANDPERHAPSNESS.” MOST ANTHROPOLOGISTS BELIEVE THAT ALL RELIGIOUS RITUALS WORK TOORDER AND UNIFY SOCIETY. TAUSSIG FINDS THE OPPOSITE WITH YAGÉ: THE CEREMONIESOPEN UP A TRANSCENDENT SPACE FOR CHAOS. HE QUOTES FROM ROLAND BARTHES’S IMAGE,MUSIC, TEXT ON THE IDEA OF A “THIRD” OR “OBTUSE MEANING,” OUTSIDE OF WHAT CAN BEEXPRESSED IN LANGUAGE OR DEFINED BY CULTURAL ANALYSIS: . . . THE OBTUSE MEANING APPEARS TO EXTEND OUTSIDE CULTURE, KNOWLEDGE,INFORMATION; ANALYTICALLY IT HAS SOMETHING DERISORY ABOUT IT; OPENING OUT INTOTHE INFINITY OF LANGUAGE, IT CAN COME THROUGH AS LIMITED IN THE EYES OF ANALYTICREASON; IT BELONGS TO THE FAMILY OF PUN, BUFFOONERY, USELESS EXPENDITURE.INDIFFERENT TO MORAL OR AESTHETIC CATEGORIES (THE TRIVIAL, THE FUTILE, THEFALSE, THE PASTICHE), IT IS ON THE SIDE OF THE CARNIVAL. FOR TAUSSIG, SHAMANISM PRESERVES A PLACE FOR KNOWLEDGE THAT CAN HEAL BECAUSE ITFALLS OUTSIDE OF ANY SYSTEM. YAGÉ VISIONS OPEN UP CONSTELLATIONS OF THE UNKNOWN,OBTUSE MEANINGS, AND “CHANCE AND PERHAPSNESS.”NARBY COLLECTED SOME OF THE MORE NUANCED ACCOUNTS OF SHAMANIC PRACTICES IN ANANTHOLOGY, SHAMANS THROUGH TIME. READ CHRONOLOGICALLY, THE ESSAYS IN THE BOOKMAKE IT CLEAR THAT TERMS FOR STUDYING SPIRITUALITY, SHAMANISM, AND MYSTICISM ARESTARTING TO SHIFT RADICALLY. RECENT TEXTS INCLUDE ONE FROM THE ANTHROPOLOGISTEDITH TURNER, WHO RECALLS SEEING “A SPIRIT FORM” DURING AN EXORCISM RITUAL INZAMBIA:“I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES A LARGE GREY BLOB OF PLASMA EMERGE FROM THE SICK WOMAN’SBACK,” SHE WRITES. “THEN I KNEW THE AFRICANS WERE RIGHT, THERE IS SPIRITAFFLICTION, IT ISN’T A MATTER OF METAPHOR AND SYMBOL, OR EVEN PSYCHOLOGY. AND IBEGAN TO SEE HOW ANTHROPOLOGISTS HAVE PERPETRATED AN ENDLESS SERIES OF PUT-DOWNSIN REGARD TO THE MANY SPIRIT EVENTS IN WHICH THEY HAVE PARTICIPATED—PARTICIPATEDIN A KINDLY PRETENSE.” TRANSFORMED BY HER OWN EXPERIENCES, TURNER DECRIES THE“RELIGIOUS FRIGIDITY” OF MODERN ANTHROPOLOGISTS.THE ANTHROPOLOGIST FRANÇOISE BARBIRA FREEDMAN STUDIED THE LAMISTA INDIANS IN THEPERUVIAN AMAZON. IN THE BOOK THE AYAHUASCA READER, SHE TELLS HOW SHE APPRENTICEDHERSELF TO A TRIBAL SHAMAN, TAKING AYAHUASCA AND LEARNING ABOUT THE LOCALTENSIONS BETWEEN SORCERERS AND SHAMANS. “AS I PROGRESSED IN MY APPRENTICESHIP,THE INCREASED AWARENESS THAT THERE WAS NO NEUTRAL POSITION WITHIN REACHFRIGHTENED ME,” SHE WRITES. “I WAS NOW IN THE GAME.” DURING ONE AYAHUASCA TRIP,SHE EXPERIENCED ANIMAL TRANSFORMATION FIRSTHAND. SHE BECAME A JAGUAR STALKINGTHROUGH THE FOREST. THE ELDER SHAMAN VISITED HER IN THE FORM OF AN EAGLE,COMMUNICATING TELEPATHICALLY. “NOTHING I EVER READ ABOUT SHAMANIC ANIMALMETAMORPHOSIS COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THE TOTAL INVOLVEMENT OF MY SENSES,BODY, MIND, IN THIS PROCESS.” THIS VISION WAS A SIGN OF ACQUISITION OF CERTAINSHAMANIC POWERS, BUT SHE WAS TOLD BY THE SHAMAN THAT IT ALSO CARRIED DANGERSWITH IT. FROM THEN ON, IF SHE CONTINUED LEARNING, SHE WOULD HAVE TO CONSTANTLYPROTECT HERSELF FROM SORCERERS AND MALEVOLENT SPIRITS BY MAGICAL MEANS. FREEDMANDECIDED TO END HER APPRENTICESHIP AT THIS POINT. “THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYPOSSIBLE VANTAGE POINT FOR ME AS AN ANTHROPOLOGIST OTHER THAN THAT OF THESHAMANIC RAINBOW,” SHE NOTES. SHE WONDERS HOW THE MORAL STRUCTURES OF WESTERNCULTURE CAN ABSORB OR ADAPT THIS ANCIENT AND AMBIGUOUS PRACTICE.FOR HIS PART, NARBY THINKS AYAHUASCA COULD BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR THE MODERNBIOLOGIST, WHO COULD USE THE SUBSTANCE TO INTERROGATE THE “MIND OF NATURE”DIRECTLY. RECENTLY, NARBY BROUGHT THREE EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGISTS DOWN TOVISIT AN AMAZONIAN SHAMAN. DURING THEIR TRANCES, THEY ATTEMPTED TO ASK DIRECTQUESTIONS OF THE AYAHUASCA SPIRIT RELATING TO THEIR AREAS OF RESEARCH. ALLRECEIVED ANSWERS TO THEIR QUERIES. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE GENETIC RESEARCHER FOUNDHERSELF TRANSFORMED INTO A PROTEIN FLYING ABOVE A LONG DNA STRAND, AND WAS ABLEIN THIS WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF CERTAIN PATTERNS IN WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLYBEEN CONSIDERED “JUNK DNA”: SHE SAW DNA SEQUENCES KNOWN AS “CPG ISLANDS,” WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PUZZLING OVERAT WORK, AND WHICH ARE FOUND UPSTREAM OF ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF ALL HUMAN GENES.SHE SAW THEY WERE STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE SURROUNDING DNA AND THAT THISSTRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE ALLOWED THEM TO BE EASILY ACCESSED AND THEREFORE TO SERVEAS “LANDING PADS” FOR TRANSCRIPTION PROTEINS, WHICH DOCK ON TO THE DNA MOLECULEAND MAKE COPIES OF PRECISE GENETIC STRUCTURES. ALL OF THE BIOLOGISTS WERE INTRIGUED BY WHAT THEY FOUND, AND TWO OF THE THREEFELT THEY HAD COMMUNICATED WITH AN “INDEPENDENT INTELLIGENCE.”WHEN DENNIS MCKENNA, TERENCE’S BOTANIST BROTHER, DRANK AYAHUASCA WITH THE UNIAODO VEGETAL, A BRAZILIAN SYNCRETIC RELIGION THAT USES AYAHUASCA AS ITS SACRAMENT,HE WAS TURNED INTO A SENTIENT WATER MOLECULE IN THE JUNGLE SOIL, PULLED UPTHROUGH A VINE’S ROOTS TO EXPERIENCE THE MIRACULOUS MOLECULAR PROCESSES OFPHOTOSYNTHESIS IN ITS LEAVES. “SOMEHOW I UNDERSTOOD—THOUGH NO WORDS WEREINVOLVED—THAT THE BANISTERIOPSIS VINE WAS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE PLANTINTELLIGENCE THAT EMBRACED AND COVERED THE EARTH,” HE RECALLED. AT THE END OFHIS VISION, A VOICE TOLD HIM, “YOU MONKEYS ONLY THINK YOU’RE RUNNING THINGS.”YAGÉ OPENS UP A PLAYFUL ZONE OF “CHANCE AND PERHAPSNESS,” YET IT SEEMS TO CONVEYPARTICULAR MESSAGES ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD, AND OFTEN CREATES SPECIFICMODELS OF NATURAL PROCESSES. MORE THAN OTHER PSYCHEDELICS, AYAHUASCA SEEMS TODISSOLVE THE RIGID CATEGORIES THAT MODERN CULTURE HAS ERECTED BETWEEN POETRY ANDSCIENCE, MEDICINE AND MAGIC, KNOWLEDGE OF THE SELF AND KNOWLEDGE OF THEUNIVERSE. IF THE “VINE OF SOULS” WAS A TRADEMARKED BRAND, I WOULD HAVE WANTED ITAS THIS BOOK’S OFFICIAL SPONSOR."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24ALL THE ENERGYIN THE UNIVERSE[images/00006.jpg] JONATHON MILLER-WEISBERGER MET DON CAESARIO SEVEN YEARS AGOAT A CONFERENCE HELD IN THE SECOYA’S ANCESTRAL HOMELAND, LA GARTA COCHA, NEARTHE HEADWATERS OF THE AMAZON. “I HAD SUCH A FUN TIME WITH THIS OLD GUY,” SAIDJONATHON, WHO COULD SOUND LIKE A WEST COAST DUDE AT ONE MOMENT, DEEPLY SERIOUSMYSTIC EXPLORER THE NEXT. “I SPENT THREE WEEKS WITH HIM AT HIS HOME, LAUGHINGALL THE TIME, SLEEPING UNDER THE SAME MOSQUITO NET. HIS HOUSE HAD FALLEN DOWNAND HE WAS LIVING WITH HIS SON. HE ASKED ME TO HELP HIM BUILD A NEW HOUSE.”JONATHON HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE SECOYA WHEN HE WAS A KID GROWING UP IN QUITO,WHERE HIS MOTHER RAN A VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT. HE FOUND A POSTCARD OF A SECOYA ATA BOOKSTORE. “I SAW THIS TOTALLY RAD-LOOKING INDIAN WEARING THIS YELLOW CROWN,WITH FLOWERS AROUND HIS ARM, STRINGS OF BEADS, AND I THOUGHT, WOW, I WOULD LOVETO MEET THAT GUY,” HE RECALLS. YEARS LATER, HE HEARD A STORY ABOUT A SECOYA WHOGOT LOST IN THE FOREST ONE NIGHT AND SLEPT AT THE TOP OF A TREE: “DURING THENIGHT, AN EVIL SPIRIT STARTED TO CUT THE TREE DOWN. THE SECOYA STARTED TO SING.HE SANG TO THE FLOWERS THAT BLOSSOMED ON THE TREE. THE FLOWERS TURNED INTOHEAVENLY BEINGS THAT STOPPED THE EVIL SPIRIT FROM HURTING HIM.”NOW THIRTY, HE WORE BLUE JEANS, BEAT-UP KEDS, AND A T-SHIRT EMBROIDERED WITH THE“OM” INSIGNIA. HE PRACTICED TAI CHI AND DISCOURSED EARNESTLY ON EASTERN WISDOMAND INDIGENOUS MYSTICISM. HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS DANIEL LIEBERMAN, MYGUIDE IN GABON. LIKE LIEBERMAN, HE WAS JEWISH, DARK-HAIRED, THIN, AN IDEALISTICOUTSIDER WITH A BUDDHIST ORIENTATION. ENCOUNTERING LIEBERMAN AND THENWEISBERGER, IT SEEMED AS IF I HAD STUMBLED ACROSS SOME CONTEMPORARYARCHETYPE—THE YOUNG ETHNOBOTANIST AS WANDERING JEWISH SAGE.JONATHON CALLED DON CAESARIO “A SAINT OF YAGÉ” WHO HAD “ACHIEVED SPIRITUALIMMORTALITY.” HE TOLD US THAT DON CAESARIO IS THE TRIBE’S LAST GREAT SHAMAN, AONCE-PRESTIGIOUS LEADER WHO LOST HIS AUTHORITY. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEWELDERS, THE TRIBE HAS STOPPED FOLLOWING SHAMANISM OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS.EVEN CAESARIO’S SON, CAESAR, WAS AN EVANGELIST, CONVERTED BY THE MISSIONARIES.ALTHOUGH CAESAR WAS THE TRIBE’S COMMUNITY PRESIDENT, LIKE MOST OF THE YOUNGERSECOYA HE WORE WESTERN CLOTHING. HE NEVER DRANK YAGÉ.AT AN EVENING CEREMONY WE MET THE LAST UPHOLDERS OF THE TRADITION, THE TRIBALELDERS, A COTERIE OF DIGNIFIED GENTLEMEN IN COLORED TUNICS AND YELLOW CROWNS WHOAVERAGED UNDER FIVE-FOOT IN HEIGHT. DON ESTEBAN, NICKNAMED MAGICO, IS A COFANINDIAN WHO MARRIED INTO THE SECOYA. ESTEBAN WORE A TRADITIONAL FEATHEREDHEADDRESS AND AN IRIDESCENT PARROT FEATHER THROUGH HIS NOSE. DON AUGUSTINE,NICKNAMED TINTIN, WAS THE APPRENTICE SHAMAN. TINTIN RARELY SAID A WORD—HE KEPTAPPROACHING ME AND THEN DISSOLVING IN MISCHIEVOUS LAUGHTER. DON EMILIO, WE WERETOLD, WAS THE MASTER OF THE FOREST, WITH AN ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF PLANTS ANDPLANT REMEDIES. MEETING THE ELDERS, I KNEW I HAD FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,WHAT I HAD WANTED AS I POUNDED THE FAMILIAR PAVEMENT OF NEW YORK CITY: AS MUCHAS THEY WERE PERFECTLY PRESENT, THE ELDERS ALSO HAD THE ECCENTRIC AURA OFMYSTICS, OF SAGES WHO TRAVELED FAR INTO DISTANT VISIONARY REALITIES AND RETURNEDTO GIGGLE ABOUT IT.DON ESTEBAN STOOD UP AND TOLD US THE STORY OF HIS LIFE. HE HAD BEEN A SHAMAN INHIS YOUTH, BUT WHEN THE MISSIONARIES ARRIVED HE ASSUMED THAT CHRISTIANITY HADGREATER POWER. HE ABANDONED HIS TRADITIONAL SPIRITUAL CULTURE AND BECAME ACHRISTIAN, WORKING WITH THE MISSIONARIES. THEY TOLD HIM NOT TO TAKE AYAHUASCA,SO HE DIDN’T. BUT AS TIME WENT ON, HE REALIZED THAT, AS A CHRISTIAN, HE WAS NOLONGER ABLE TO HEAL ANYBODY. A NEPHEW OF HIS DIED, AND HE KNEW THAT WITHAYAHUASCA HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HEAL HIM. HE DECIDED THAT CHRISTIANITYDIDN’T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND HE RETURNED, AFTER A THIRTY-YEAR HIATUS, TOAYAHUASCA. HE ALSO SAID HE HAD TRIED LSD, GIVEN TO HIM BY A TOURIST, AND THAT HECOULD USE IT TO HEAL AS WELL. “LSD IS STRONG MEDICINE,” HE SAID. HE PROMISED TOHELP US REACH THE “DEEP SPIRITUAL REALMS.”I WAS READY.BUT ON THE DAY SCHEDULED FOR OUR FIRST YAGÉ CEREMONY, DON CAESARIO ANNOUNCED HEDIDN’T FEEL WELL. WORSE YET, HE HAD SUFFERED FROM BAD DREAMS DURING THE NIGHT.DREAMS ARE PART OF THE SHAMAN’S PROFESSIONAL EQUIPMENT. THE CEREMONY WASPOSTPONED.SHAMANISM IS A DELICATE ENTERPRISE. THICK COILS OF THE AYAHUASCA VINES GREW NEARTHE CEREMONIAL LODGE. EARLY THAT MORNING, A FEW OF US, MYSELF INCLUDED, WALKEDUP TO THE VINES AND LOOKED THEM OVER. WE EVEN TOUCHED THEM. AT BREAKFAST, WELEARNED THAT OUR EXAMINATION GAVE DON CAESARIO, WHO WASN’T WATCHING US, ASPLITTING HEADACHE. MENSTRUATING WOMEN ALSO DISTURBED THE SHAMAN—CAESARIO ISMARRIED, BUT TO KEEP HIS SPIRIT PURE, HE HAS BEEN CELIBATE FOR DECADES—AND ABOUTHALF THE WOMEN IN OUR GROUP WERE HAVING THEIR “MOON.” THESE WOMEN WERE FORBIDDENFROM GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THE YAGÉ OR PARTICIPATING IN THE CEREMONIES.SOME OF US CONSOLED OURSELVES WITH A LONG HIKE LED BY DON EMILIO, THE FORESTMAESTRO. IN THE HUMID, VINE-CANOPIED JUNGLE, MY FELLOW TOURISTS AND I, IN RUBBERBOOTS AND HIKING GEAR, BLUNDERED ALONG LIKE ENORMOUS MARSHMALLOWS NEXT TO OURQUIET, BAREFOOT GUIDE. DON EMILIO SHOWED US THE DRAGON BLOOD TREE, CUTTING THEBARK WITH HIS MACHETE TO LET BLOOD-RED SAP RUN OUT. HE CARVED A THICK VINE INTOA WOODEN EYEDROPPER THAT SLOWLY DRIPPED SAP INTO OUR EYES—THE JUNGLE VERSION OFVISINE. HE POINTED OUT HEALING PLANTS CLINGING TO THE TREES.THAT NIGHT I COULD NOT SLEEP. THE HIKE WAS MY FIRST VENTURE INTO THE DEPTHS OFTHE RAIN FOREST, AND THE JUNGLE WAS ITS OWN TRIP. IMAGES OF ENDLESS PLANT FORMSAND SWAYING VINES FLASHED ON MY CLOSED EYELIDS LIKE PHOTO PRINTS. MEANWHILE, SIXMILES FROM MY HAMMOCK, OCCIDENTAL WAS DRILLING AN EXPLORATORY OIL WELL.THE TINY REMNANT OF THE SECOYA TRIBE WAS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. THIEVES WEREONLY ONE THREAT AMONG MANY: THE INDIANS FEARED COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND THE MASSQUANTITY OF HERBICIDES THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS SPRAYING ALONG THE BORDER.THE BIGGEST FEAR OF ALL, HOWEVER, WAS THE ENCROACHING OIL COMPANY.IN A SCENE STRAIGHT OUT OF APOCALYPSE NOW, A LARGE SQUARE OF LAND HAD BEENCLEARED IN THE MIDST OF DEEP JUNGLE, WITH HELICOPTERS WHIRLING OVER ATWO-HUNDRED-FOOT DRILLING PLATFORM AS THEY DROPPED SUPPLIES INTO THE CAMP. THEDRILLING, WHICH HAD BEEN GOING ON SINCE LATE LAST YEAR, WAS CURRENTLY 8,700 FEETDEEP, AND THE COMPANY HAD YET TO STRIKE OIL. IF THEY DO INDEED FIND OIL,OCCIDENTAL WILL BUILD A ROAD STRAIGHT TO THE SITE. THE DESTRUCTION OF THESURROUNDING FOREST AND THE SECOYA CULTURE WILL SOON FOLLOW.PRESSURED BY OCCIDENTAL AND THE ECUADOREAN GOVERNMENT, THE SECOYA AGREED TO GIVEACCESS TO THEIR LAND FOR $700,000, A PALTRY SUM CONSIDERING THE HUNDREDS OFMILLIONS A SUCCESSFUL OIL PROSPECT COULD YIELD. EVEN SO, THE BRIBES HANDED OUTBY THE OIL COMPANIES ARE OFTEN ENOUGH TO DESTABILIZE INDIAN GROUPS WHO HAVE NOPRACTICE IN ECONOMIC PLANNING. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT INDIGENOUS GROUPS WHO UP UNTILFIFTY YEARS AGO WERE STRANGERS TO THE MODERN WORLD—WHO STILL HAVE A COMPLETELYDIFFERENT, COMMUNAL CONCEPTION OF LAND AND PROPERTY THAN WE DO, AND NO TRADITIONOF USING MONEY—SHOULD NOT BE NEGOTIATING WITH LEGAL TEAMS FROM THE OILCOMPANIES. BUT THAT’S BEEN THE PRACTICE FOR SOME TIME.IN THE EARLY 1990S, JONATHON WORKED ON BOUNDARY DEMARCATION WITH THE HUARANI, ATRIBE OF TWELVE HUNDRED HUNTER-GATHERERS GIVEN TITLE TO TWO MILLION ACRES OFAMAZONIAN RAIN FOREST. “NOBODY EVER TREATED ME THE WAY THE HUARANI TREATED ME,”HE SAID. “THEY WERE THE MOST PROPER PEOPLE I EVER MET.” FOR JONATHON, THEHUARANI SEEMED TO EXIST IN A ZONE OF SPIRITUAL PERFECTION: “THEY WERE TOTALLYDETACHED FROM EVERYTHING. EVEN FROM THEIR OWN LIVES.” HE BEFRIENDED WEPE, AONE-HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD HUARANI WHO HAD KILLED A HUNDRED MEN. WEPE TOLD HIM, “THETIP OF MY SPIRIT CUTS THROUGH EVERYTHING.” THE HUARANI WERE THE ONLY INDIANS INTHE REGION WHO DIDN’T USE HALLUCINOGENS—THEY DIDN’T NEED THEM.AT THE TIME, THE LAND TITLE SEEMED LIKE A MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE HUARANI, BUTWHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR GRANTS LAND TO INDIGENOUS GROUPS, IT FORCES THEMTO FORFEIT SUBSOIL RIGHTS. THE ONCE-PRISTINE HUARANI TERRITORY WAS NOWCRISSCROSSED BY ROADS BUILT BY THE OIL COMPANIES, FOLLOWED BY THE TIMBERCOMPANIES. THE TRIBE WAS LIVING IN COMPANY-BUILT SHACKS.OVER TWENTY YEARS, THE WELLS WILL PRODUCE ENOUGH OIL TO SATE U.S. DEMAND FOR, ATTHE MOST, TWO WEEKS.“I WEPT FOR FOUR DAYS STRAIGHT ABOUT THE HUARANI,” JONATHON SAID. “I WEPT UNTILI COULDN’T WEEP ANYMORE.”THE JUNGLE SURROUNDING THE SECOYA IS FACING THE SAME PROCESS OF SHORTSIGHTEDPILLAGING. THE SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION OF THE AMAZON RAIN FORESTS, FORMED OVERMILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION, THE LIVING LUNGS OF THE PLANET, MEANSEVER-ACCELERATING CLIMATE CHANGE. I HAVE READ THAT SOME INDIAN TRIBES IN NORTHAMERICA WOULD CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS SEVEN GENERATIONS INTOTHE FUTURE. OUR “ADVANCED” SOCIETY, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEMS UNABLE TO ENVISIONTHE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS ACTIONS EVEN A FEW YEARS AHEAD.. . .TWO DAYS LATER, WHEN TENSIONS HAD SUBSIDED, DON CAESARIO ANNOUNCED WE WOULDDRINK YAGÉ THAT NIGHT. AT BREAKFAST I TOLD PABLO AMARINGO MY DREAM OF THE NIGHTBEFORE. I DREAMT THAT I WAS DRAFTED TO FIGHT IN A WAR. PARTS OF THE DREAM TOOKPLACE IN BOOTCAMP, BUT IT WAS ALL QUITE FRIENDLY. AMARINGO SMILED. “YOUR DREAMMEANS THAT YOU ARE BEING CONSCRIPTED INTO THE ARMY OF THE SPIRITS,” HE TOLD ME.AT SUNSET WE GATHERED IN THE LODGE, A LONG THATCHED BUILDING WITH POSTS SET UPFOR STRINGING ROWS OF HAMMOCKS. THE SHAMAN LAY IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM,ATTENDED BY HIS ASSISTANT, TINTIN. THE SECOYA, IN THEIR CROWNS AND BEADS ANDTWINED FLOWERS, LAY IN ROWS ON ONE SIDE OF HIM, THE VISITORS ON THE OTHER. THEREWERE THIRTY OF US ALTOGETHER, SWAYING IN OUR HAMMOCKS. SEVERAL YOUNG SECOYA WEREDRINKING YAGÉ FOR THE FIRST TIME, INCLUDING CAESARIO’S TEENAGE GRANDSON. FOR ONENIGHT, ANYWAY, THEY TRADED IN THEIR BASKETBALL SHORTS AND SNEAKERS FOROLD-SCHOOL SECOYA TUNICS AND CROWNS.I FELT BAD FOR ANNIE AND THE OTHER WOMEN HAVING THEIR “MOON.” THEY HAD COME ALLTHIS WAY ONLY TO BE DENIED THE CHANCE TO TRY YAGÉ. JEAN-MICHEL, THE FRENCHMAN,BACKED OUT, PERHAPS FEARING THE PSYCHEDELIC MIGHT UNDERMINE HIS RIGID GALLICPREJUDICES.ONE BY ONE, WE WERE CALLED UP TO DON CAESARIO, WHO GAVE US A COCONUT CUP FULL OFYAGÉ, FIRST BLOWING SOFT PRAYERS INTO IT. I CHUGGED THE BITTER BREW, SUPPRESSINGSHUDDERS. EAGER TO PUSH MYSELF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, I FORCED MYSELF TO GO BACK TOTHE SHAMAN FOR TWO MORE CUPFULS OF JUNGLE MURK LATER IN THE NIGHT, OVERCOMINGSPASMS OF REVULSION EACH TIME.I LAY BACK IN MY HAMMOCK AS THE ACTIVITY BEHIND MY EYELIDS SLOWLY INTENSIFIED.COLDNESS ENVELOPED ME. I FELT LIKE A CATERPILLAR IN A COCOON, IMMOBILIZED,RECEPTIVE, FIGHTING THE TURBULENCE IN MY STOMACH. TIME SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN ANDDISTEND.EYES CLOSED, I SAW A GRID STRETCHING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. GEOMETRICAL FORMS OFSTROBING SPHERES AND PYRAMIDS AROSE ON ALL THE POINTS OF THE GRID. THESE FORMSGAVE WAY TO SHAPE-SHIFTING GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS, THEN MORE EXPLICIT IMAGERY. ISAW THE VAGUE FORM OF A MAYAN-LIKE DEITY WITH AN ANIMAL SNOUT AND INDIANHEADDRESS. I TRIED TO FOLLOW HIM, BUT HE VANISHED INTO THE ETHER. I LOOKED INTOA SWIRLING SNAKE PIT AT THE CENTER OF MY VISUAL FIELD, WHERE SERPENTS SLITHEREDAND COILED AROUND EACH OTHER. THE SNAKE PIT TURNED INTO A FIELD WHERE PLANTSWERE GROWING AT AN INCREDIBLE VELOCITY, BLOSSOMING AND THEN DECAYING, AGAIN ANDAGAIN AND AGAIN. AN ENDLESS PROFUSION OF BOTANICAL FORMS ROSE UP, SWOONED, DIED,AND ROTTED AWAY. THERE SEEMED TO BE A MESSAGE TO THIS—THAT A PLANT, LIKE EVERYLIVING BEING, WAS ACTUALLY MADE OF ENERGY, THE FORM WE SEE JUST A TEMPORARYSNAPSHOT, AN ILLUSORY INTERRUPTION OF THE CONSTANT FLOW, THE MOVEMENT OF THESPIRIT.EVERY NOW AND THEN THE IMAGES WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SPASMODIC GASPS OFSOMEBODY VOMITING IN THE BUSHES. I DIDN’T THROW UP. AS I NOTICED WHEN I TOOKYAGÉ IN NEW YORK, THERE WAS A BIZARRE HUMOR TO THE VISIONS. AT ONE POINT IWATCHED A LINE OF BLACK SPACEMEN SLOWLY FILING INTO A BLACK SPACESHIP. IT WAS ASOMBER, MELANCHOLY VISION. SUDDENLY I UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THIS SPACESHIP.MY BOWELS SPUTTERING, I NEEDED TO FIND THE OUTHOUSE. I STAGGERED OUT INTO THEJUNGLE. THE STARS WERE MERRY AND BRIGHT OVERHEAD, THE BANANA PALMS AND HOVERINGTREES SEEMED TO BE WELCOMING ME INTO THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE AS I SENT OFF MYSPACEMEN.THE SECOYA SANG INCREDIBLE MELODIES THROUGH THE NIGHT. SONGS OF HEALING MAGIC,CHANTS IN A LANGUAGE TAUGHT TO THEM BY THE SPIRITS. SOMETIMES THE SONGSHUMOROUSLY COPIED GURGLES OF NAUSEA OR THE ROAR OF A WILD BOAR. DON ESTEBANSTOOD UP AND LET LOOSE WITH LONG, UNWINDING WHOOPS THAT HAD THE MANIC FEROCITYOF ARCHAIC WAR CRIES. A SHIVER WAS PASSING THROUGH REALITY—WHEN I OPENED MY EYESI COULD SEE IT, LIKE ELECTRIC PULSES—AND THE SONGS MATCHED THE FAST, STUTTERINGRHYTHM OF THAT SHIVER.IT WAS AS IF THE CEREMONIAL LODGE HAD BECOME A BOAT OR A SPACESHIP, GLIDINGACROSS DARK WATER, WITH DON CAESARIO CALM AT THE HELM. THE MUSIC WAS LIKE THERUDDER LEADING US FORWARD. I FELT TINGLING VIBRATIONS IN MY TEETH, ANDTHROUGHOUT MY BODY I COULD SENSE CURRENTS LIKE A MAGNETIC PULL FOLLOWING THEDIRECTIONS WHERE THE SONGS WERE CARRYING US.THE HALLUCINATIONS STARTED TO DEEPEN INTO A REALM THAT I COULD NOT RECOGNIZE,THAT I LACK LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE. I FOUND MYSELF WANDERING ACROSS A SHIMMERINGSPACE WITH BEINGS THAT NEVER STOPPED CHANGING—PORCUPINE-QUILLED, TUSKED,MULTITONGUED, AMOEBIC, BUT EVEN THOSE WORDS ARE ONLY APPROXIMATIONS OF ENTITIESTHAT COULD BE COMPARED TO THE DARKER IMAGININGS OF H. P. LOVECRAFT. THE SHAMANAND THE ELDERS SEEMED TO BE INHABITING THIS SPACE WITH ME. GLOWING IN THE LIGHTCAST BY THE FIRE, THEIR FEATURES SEEMED ANIMATED BY AN ALMOST NONHUMANINTENSITY. THEY SANG, THEIR WORDS UNINTELLIGIBLE, TO THESE CREATURES,INTERACTING WITH THEM, IN MYSTICAL COMMUNION. IT SEEMED THAT THIS WAS THE GOALOF THE AYAHUASCA CEREMONY, THE ARRIVAL POINT. THESE WERE “THE HEAVENLY PEOPLE.”DON CAESARIO DRANK ANOTHER CUP OF THE BITTER BREW, PREPARED FOR HIM BY HISASSISTANT TINTIN. THEN HE SANG ALONE. HIS SONG SEEMED TO BE THE WILDEST AND MOSTPRIVATE ODE, A PSALM OF SOLITUDE, UNVEILING THE SECRET KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SOUL. HEBARELY WHISPERED. HE BREATHED INTO THE STARS. THEN THE MELODY RETURNED, HISVOICE ROSE UP. TO MY AUGMENTED EARS, HE SEEMED TO BE WEAVING A SUBTLE DISCOURSEON REALITY, DESCRIBING THE VICTORY OF FORM OVER EMPTINESS. AS HE SANG, HESEDUCED A SPIRIT-CREATURE THAT STARTED TO GROW, SPINNING COTTON CANDY FILAMENTSAROUND ITSELF. THEN TINTIN STARTED TO SING AS WELL. BUT HE SEEMED TO CHALLENGETHE SHAMAN’S METAPHYSICAL VIEWPOINT, ARGUING THAT EMPTINESS ULTIMATELY TRIUMPHSOVER FORM. DON CAESARIO SADLY CONCURRED, AND THE COTTON CANDY CREATION WASRELEASED TO FALL BACK INTO THE VOID. STARTLED BY THE CONCRETENESS OF THESEHALLUCINATIONS, I DID A QUICK REALITY CHECK, OPENING MY EYES TO THE NIGHT. THESHAMAN LAY BACK, ILLUMINATED BY THE FLAMES, THE OTHER TOURISTS BREATHED OR SLEPTNEAR ME IN THEIR HAMMOCKS.I HAD NO MORE DOUBTS THAT THE SECOYA ENGAGED IN EXTRADIMENSIONAL EXPLORATION,USING AYAHUASCA AS THEIR PSYCHIC TELESCOPE AND TRANSPORT. THIS WAS WHAT JONATHONCALLED THE “SPIRITUAL SCIENCE OF THE AMAZON.” FOR THE INDIANS THERE WAS, IREALIZED, NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NATURAL AND THE SUPERNATURAL WORLDS. THEIRSONGS WERE THE CHANTS OF SPIRITS CALLING OUT TO OTHER SPIRITS AND ELEMENTALFORCES, WEAVING THROUGH THE ASTRAL REALMS.LATER I LEARNED THAT THE SECOYA ELDERS SAY THAT, THROUGH YAGÉ, THEY CANSOMETIMES SING NEW PLANTS INTO BEING. AT THE END OF A LONG NIGHT OF PURE TRANCE,DON CAESARIO MAY LOOK DOWN AT HIS FIST TO FIND HE IS HOLDING A SEED OR SAPLINGIN HIS PALM. HE BURIES THAT GIFT FROM THE HEAVENLY PEOPLE IN HIS GARDEN. IN AFEW MONTHS IT GROWS INTO A MEDICINAL HERB, A NEW REMEDY TO ADD TO THEIREXTENSIVE HERBARIUM.. . .IN THE MORNING WE COMPARED NOTES ON OUR JOURNEYS. SOME OF THE TRAVELERS WEREDISAPPOINTED. SOME FELT HEALED OR REJUVENATED. TAMMY, NO LONGER SICK, JUSTGIGGLED AT THE “WEIRD STUFF” SHE HAD SEEN DURING THE NIGHT—ABSTRACT FORMS,GEOMETRICAL SWIRLS, TREMBLING ENTITIES. “IT WAS TOTALLY FUN, BUT I DON’T KNOWTHAT IT MEANT ANYTHING,” SHE SAID.MARK AND ANDREW SUFFERED INTERMINABLE (YOU HAVE TO TAKE YAGÉ TO FULLY APPRECIATETHE MEANING OF “INTERMINABLE”) NAUSEA AND VOMITING, AND RECEIVED NO VISIONS. DUETO SOME LAST-SECOND FAILURE OF WILL OR NERVE, THEY HADN’T PUSHED THEMSELVES TODRINK MORE. “IT’S NOT MY DRUG,” SHRUGGED MARK. HE CHALKED IT UP TO THE ELUSIVEWAYS OF THE “GREAT SPIRIT” AND SEEMED RELIEVED TO BE DONE WITH IT, READY TO GOHOME. ANDREW, HOWEVER, STRUGGLED TO LAUGH OFF HIS FRUSTRATION OVER FAILING, YETAGAIN, TO HAVE VISIONS. LIKE A SECRETIVE MAGICIAN WILLING TO REVEAL ONLY ONETRICK, THE PLANT REFUSED TO SHOW HIM ANYTHING NEW. EACH TIME HE DRANK, ITATTACKED HIS GUTS WITH MORE VIOLENCE.OCTAVIA SAID SHE ROCKETED THROUGH VISIONARY REALITIES. SHE WAS LED AROUND AMUSEUM OF ARCHAIC ARTIFACTS TO A SMALL CUBE OF GLOWING WHITE LIGHT. “PICK ITUP,” THE SPIRITS URGED HER. “WHAT IS IT?” SHE ASKED. “IT IS ALL THE ENERGY INTHE UNIVERSE.” SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE IT ALONE.BARBARA NELSON AND KERRY LOCKLEAR, A PSYCHOLOGIST AND SOCIAL WORKER, SHARED AVISION OF A SMALL OWL WATCHING THEM. THREE OTHERS, INCLUDING A QUECHUA INDIAN,SAW DOLPHINS SPIRALING IN A BLUE OCEAN. (SUCH “TRANSPERSONAL” SIGHTINGS ARECOMMON ON YAGÉ; WHEN THE DRUG WAS DISCOVERED BY WESTERNERS IN THE 1920S,SCIENTISTS GAVE IT THE NAME TELEPATHINE.)WHEN I TRIED TO TELL DON ESTEBAN ABOUT MY NIGHT, HE LAUGHED. “YOUR SOUL WASFLYING OUTSIDE YOUR BODY,” HE SAID. “WHEN YOUR SOUL IS FLYING LIKE THAT, YOU CANGO ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO. YOU CAN SEE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE.”JONATHON BURST INTO THE CEREMONIAL LODGE WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES. EVEN WITHOUTPARTAKING OF THE YAGÉ, HE HAD BEEN UP ALL NIGHT, TORMENTED BY IMAGES OFENCROACHING OIL COMPANIES, MURDEROUS GUERRILLAS, THE DOOMED TRIBE.“WHERE ELSE ARE YOU EVER GOING TO FIND OLD DUDES LIKE THIS WHO STAY UP ALL NIGHTTO SING FOR YOU AND HEAL YOU?” HE ASKED. “ANYWAY, NOTHING EVER REALLY GOESEXTINCT. WE MIGHT THINK IT DOES, BUT THERE ARE A MILLION BILLION UNIVERSES OUTTHERE. EVERYTHING THAT DISAPPEARS FROM OUR WORLD GETS REBORN SOMEWHERE ELSE.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00011.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25THE MULTIPLE MILLION-EYED MONSTERTHE DISEASE IS STRIKING IN BEACHSIDE BEATNIK PADS AND IN THE DORMITORIES OFEXPENSIVE PREP SCHOOLS; IT HAS GROWN INTO AN ALARMING PROBLEM AT UCLA AND ON THEUC CAMPUS AT BERKELEY. AND EVERYWHERE THE DIAGNOSIS IS THE SAME: PSYCHOTICILLNESS RESULTING FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED, NONMEDICAL USE OF THE DRUG LSD-25.—TIME, MARCH 1966[images/00006.jpg] I WAS BORN IN 1966, TOO YOUNG TO CATCH THE ELECTRICCRACKLING OF THAT ERA’S SOCIAL, SEXUAL, AND NEUROCHEMICAL TURMOIL EXCEPT AS AVAGUE CHILDHOOD FLASHBACK—I SEEM TO HAVE SOME SHADOWY MEMORY OF A PROTEST MARCHOR TWO, AND A VIVID IMPRESSION OF WATCHING MY BABY-SITTER EXCITEDLY PEELING THESTATIC-CLINGING PLASTIC WRAP FROM THE BEATLES’ NEW ALBUM, ABBEY ROAD. I THINK IMUST HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY BATHED IN THE BEATLES’ SONIC WAVES AS A CHILD, FOREVEN TODAY I FIND THEIR HARMONIES, LIKE FAMILIAR LULLABIES, INSTANTLY PACIFYING.FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE, MY PARENTS LIVED ON SAINT MARK’S PLACE, INTHE MIDST OF COUNTERCULTURE CHAOS, ALTHOUGH THEY WERE A GENERATION OLDER THANTHE HIPPIES. MY MOTHER, A FORMER BEAT, WAS AN EDITOR AT MCGRAW-HILL, WHERE SHESLIPPED ABBIE HOFFMAN’S FIRST BOOK, REVOLUTION FOR THE HELL OF IT, AS WELL AS“MOVEMENT” WORKS BY BLACK REVOLUTIONARIES, FEMINISTS, AND MARXIST ORGANIZERS,ONTO AN OTHERWISE CONSERVATIVE LIST. YET SHE WROTE IN HER MEMOIR MINORCHARACTERS: THE SIXTIES WERE NEVER QUITE MY TIME. THEY SEEMED ANTICLIMACTIC, FOR ALL THEIRFIREWORKS. SOME CULMINATION HAD BEEN SHORT-CIRCUITED. I SAW HIPPIES REPLACEBEATNIKS, SOCIOLOGISTS REPLACE POETS, THE EMPTY CANVAS REPLACE THE KLINE.UNENTHUSIASTICALLY, I OBSERVED THE EMERGENCE OF “LIFESTYLE.” THE OLD INTENSITIESWERE BLANDING OUT INTO “DO YOUR OWN THING”—THE COMMANDMENT OF A FREEDOM EXCISEDOF STRUGGLE. ECSTASY HAD BECOME CHEMICAL, FORGETFULNESS COULD BE HAD BYPRESCRIPTION. THE YEAR OF MY BIRTH WAS THE YEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT OUTLAWED LSD AND OTHERPSYCHEDELICS AFTER A SERIES OF EMERGENCY SENATE HEARINGS, DOMINATED BY A MOOD OFPANIC. AT THE SAME TIME, MAINSTREAM OPINION, INFORMED BY THE EXAGGERATED HORRORSTORIES BROADCAST BY THE MASS MEDIA, TURNED AGAINST LSD, WHICH WENT FROM “WONDERDRUG” TO “HORROR DRUG” IN A FEW BRIEF YEARS. ALTHOUGH EARLIER STUDIES HAD SHOWNLSD TO BE “ASTONISHINGLY SAFE,” NOW EVERY CRISIS, EVERY EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT ORSUICIDE ATTEMPT, THAT COULD BE LINKED TO USE OF THE DRUG WAS FRONT-PAGE NEWS.AND OF COURSE, THE MEDIA MADE NO ATTEMPT TO PUT SUCH DATA IN THE CONTEXT OFMUCH-MORE DAMNING STATISTICS OF FATALITIES AND CRIMES CAUSED BY SOCIALLYAPPROVED SUBSTANCES SUCH AS BARBITUATES, CIGARETTES, AND ALCOHOL.AS JAY STEVENS WRITES IN STORMING HEAVEN, “BY THE AUTUMN OF 1966, OPPONENTS WEREHINTING THAT LSD PROBABLY CAUSED LONG-TERM BRAIN DAMAGE. THEIR EVIDENCE? THEFACT THAT SO MANY KIDS, POST-LSD, SHOWED LITTLE DESIRE TO ADJUST TO THECORPORATE-SUBURBAN LIFESTYLE EMBRACED BY THEIR PARENTS.” ANOTHER SCIENTIFICSTUDY, QUICKLY PICKED UP BY NEWSPAPERS AROUND THE COUNTRY, SUGGESTED THAT LSDDAMAGED CHROMOSOMES—ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY’S EVIDENCE WAS QUICKLY REFUTED, THEIMAGE STUCK IN THE PUBLIC’S MIND. NORMAN MAILER, WHO COULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER,HARPS ON IT REPEATEDLY IN ARMIES OF THE NIGHT, ENVISIONING THE HIPPIES WITH“TWENTY GENERATIONS OF BURIED HOPES PERHAPS ENGRAVED IN THEIR CHROMOSOMES, ANDNOW CONCEIVABLY BURNING LIKE FAGGOTS IN THE SECRET INQUISITIONAL FIRES OF LSD.”EVEN TODAY, MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT LSD AND OTHER PSYCHEDELICS DAMAGE EITHERBRAINS OR GENES, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT EITHER POSITION. ITSEEMS THE ONLY SERIOUS DANGER OF LSD USE IS THAT IT MAY REVEAL A PREEXISTINGPSYCHOTIC CONDITION. DESPITE ALARMIST REPORTS, FLASHBACKS SEEM TO BECHIMERAS—RARELY ENCOUNTERED AND HARDLY DANGEROUS. BUT OF COURSE, LIKE ALLPOWERFUL TOOLS, LSD, EVEN IF IT WERE LEGALIZED, SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITHCAUTION.TWO EXCELLENT BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON THE HISTORY OF LSD AND THECOUNTERCULTURE: STEVENS’S STORMING HEAVEN: LSD AND THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND ACIDDREAMS: THE COMPLETE SOCIAL HISTORY OF LSD: THE CIA, THE SIXTIES, AND BEYOND BYMARTIN A. LEE AND BRUCE SHLAIN. STORMING HEAVEN, FOR THE MOST PART, FOLLOWS THEADVENTUROUS ANTICS OF ALDOUS HUXLEY, TIMOTHY LEARY, KEN KESEY, ALLEN GINSBERG,AND OTHER PSYCHEDELIC AVATARS WHO SPREAD THE LSD GOSPEL, ESCAPED FROM POLICE ANDFEDERAL AGENTS, SOUGHT PERSONAL ENLIGHTENMENT, AND TRIPPED AND SKIPPED ACROSSTHE GLOBE. ACID DREAMS, ON THE OTHER HAND, REVEALS A DARKER UNDERCURRENT,EXPLORING THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CIA TO LSD THROUGH THE SECRETMIND-CONTROL PROGRAM, MK-ULTRA. ACID DREAMS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE CIA AND THEMILITARY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGE-SCALE DISPERSION OF LSD TO RESEARCHHOSPITALS AND ACADEMIC STUDIES—KEN KESEY AND ALLEN GINSBERG, AMONG OTHERS, FIRSTTRIED LSD UNDER THE AUSPICES OF GOVERNMENT-FUNDED STUDIES.THE SHORTCIRCUITED SIXTIES WERE POLARIZED BETWEEN EXTREMES: ON ONE HAND, THEPOLITICAL AND PERSONAL EXPERIMENTS OF THE YOUNG; ON THE OTHER, THE WARS AND NEWSYSTEMS OF SOCIAL CONTROL PURSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT; ON THE ONE HAND, THEPOPULIST STRUGGLE OF GUERRILLA INSURGENTS IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES; ON THEOTHER, THE EVER-INCREASING REACH OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM.IN HIS ESSAY “PERIODIZING THE SIXTIES,” THE CRITIC FREDERIC JAMESON SHOWS HOWTHE UTOPIAN FERVOR AND COUNTERCULTURE OF THE ERA MASKED, AND IN A SENSEMIRRORED, THE UNLEASHING OF NEW FORMS OF REPRESSION AND NEW ECONOMIC FORCES.JAMESON DATES THE START OF THE 1960S “WITH THE GREAT MOVEMENT OF DECOLONIZATIONIN BRITISH AND FRENCH AFRICA,” AND THE SUCCESSFUL REVOLUTIONS OF THE THIRDWORLD, ESPECIALLY THE ALGERIAN WAR AND THE CUBAN REVOLUTION OF 1959, WHICHANNOUNCED THAT THE SIXTIES WOULD BE AN ERA OF RADICAL BREAKS AND RAPIDINNOVATIONS.AND YET, JAMESON WRITES, “THE CONCEPTION OF THE THIRD WORLD 60S AS A MOMENT WHENALL OVER THE WORLD CHAINS AND SHACKLES OF A CLASSICAL IMPERIALIST KIND WERETHROWN OFF IN A STIRRING WAVE OF ‘WARS OF NATIONAL LIBERATION’ IS AN ALTOGETHERMYTHICAL SIMPLIFICATION.” DURING THE 1960S, THERE WAS A TRANSFORMATION FROM ONEMODE OF FIRST WORLD DOMINANCE TO ANOTHER—FROM DIRECT COLONIZATION TO A NEW,SUBTLER, BUT ULTIMATELY MORE EFFECTIVE NEOCOLONIALISM. TODAY, THATTRANSFORMATION IS SYMBOLIZED BY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK AND THEINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. THIS PROCESS TURNED MUCH OF THE THIRD WORLD INTOPERMANENT DEBTOR NATIONS. THE “GREEN REVOLUTION”—THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OFAGRICULTURE, DISRUPTING LOCAL ECONOMIES AND INDIGENOUS CULTURES—FORCED THECREATION OF GUERRILLA INSURGENTS AND RESISTANCE MOVEMENTS.WHILE THE HIPPIES WERE TUNING IN AND TURNING ON, CAPITALISM DID NOT RETREATDURING THE 1960S. IT WAS EXPANDING AND MUTATING RAPIDLY, DISCOVERING NEW MEANSOF PRODUCTION, CARVING OUT NEW MARKETS, REFINING ITS METHODS OF CONTROL: LATE CAPITALISM IN GENERAL (AND THE 60S IN PARTICULAR) CONSTITUTE A PROCESS INWHICH THE LAST SURVIVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ZONES OF PRECAPITALISM—THE LASTVESTIGES OF NONCOMMODIFIED OR TRADITIONAL SPACE WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE ADVANCEDWORLD—ARE NOW ULTIMATELY PENETRATED AND COLONIZED IN THEIR TURN. LATE CAPITALISMCAN THEREFORE BE DESCRIBED AS THE MOMENT WHEN THE LAST VESTIGES OF NATURE WHICHSURVIVED ON INTO CLASSICAL CAPITALISM ARE AT LENGTH ELIMINATED: NAMELY THE THIRDWORLD AND THE UNCONSCIOUS. THE 60S WILL THEN HAVE BEEN THE MOMENTOUSTRANSFORMATIONAL PERIOD WHEN THIS SYSTEMIC RESTRUCTURING TAKES PLACE ON A GLOBALSCALE. IN THE CULTURAL FIELD (WHAT MARXISTS CALL THE SUPERSTRUCTURE, COMPARED TO THEECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE), THE “SIXTIES” WERE MARKED BY THE SENSE THAT ANYTHINGWAS POSSIBLE, THAT THE WORLD WORKED ON MAGICAL AND MYSTICAL PRINCIPLES AS WELLAS RATIONAL ONES. THIS TEMPORARY RETURN OF “MARVELOUS INTUITION,” TO BORROW ASHAKESPEAREAN PHRASE, WAS PARTIALLY FUELED BY THE TRANSFORMATIVE SURGES OF LSD.IN JAMESON’S TERMS, “THIS SENSE OF FREEDOM AND POSSIBILITY . . . CAN PERHAPSBEST BE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURAL MOVEMENT AND PLAY ENABLED BYTRANSITION FROM ONE INFRASTRUCTURAL SYSTEM OR SYSTEMIC STAGE OF CAPITALISM TOANOTHER. THE 60S WERE IN THAT SENSE AN IMMENSE AND INFLATIONARY ISSUING OFSUPERSTRUCTURAL CREDIT.”THE TRANSITION BETWEEN WORLD ECONOMIC SYSTEMS OPENED A TEMPORARY GAP OFIDEOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY, AND IN THIS GAP, THE MIRAGE OF THE CULTURAL AND SOCIALREVOLUTION OF THE SIXTIES SPREAD ITS RAINBOW. THE SIXTIES ULTIMATELY REVEALSITSELF AS A “PROPERLY DIALECTICAL PROCESS, IN WHICH ‘LIBERATION’ AND DOMINATIONARE INEXTRICABLY COMBINED.” JAMESON WROTE THIS ESSAY IN THE 1980S. TODAY IT ISEVEN CLEARER HOW THE EXPLOSIVE POTENTIAL OF THE SIXTIES LED “TO POWERFULRESTORATIONS OF THE SOCIAL ORDER AND A RENEWAL OF THE REPRESSIVE POWER OF THEVARIOUS STATE APPARATUSES.” THE THIRTY-YEAR WAR ON DRUGS, BEGUN UNDER PRESIDENTNIXON, HAS BEEN ONE POTENT AGENT OF THAT REPRESSION (1.6 MILLION AMERICANS WEREARRESTED FOR DRUG VIOLATIONS IN THE YEAR 2000 ALONE, MORE THAN 600,000 FORPOSSESSION OF MARIJUANA). THE NEW WAR ON TERRORISM, ALLOWING CENTRALIZEDDOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING, MAY WELL TURN OUT TO BE ANOTHER ONE.JAMESON, OF COURSE, LIKE MOST MARXISTS, HAS NO INTEREST IN DRUGS. THE FACT THATPHYSICAL MATTER, PLANTS AND CHEMICALS, CAN RADICALLY TRANSFORM HUMANCONSCIOUSNESS FALLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF TRADITIONAL MARXIST ANALYSIS (EVENTHOUGH MARXIST DIALECTICS HAVE A MYSTICAL STREAK). JAMESON IGNORES THE PART THATLSD MIGHT HAVE PLAYED IN TRANSFORMING THE SUPERSTRUCTURE, EVEN THOUGH NATURE ANDTHE UNCONSCIOUS, THOSE LAST ASPECTS OF TRADITIONALISM TO BE ELIMINATED BYCAPITALISM, ARE THE PARTICULAR FORCES REVEALED, IN MYTHICALLY TRANSFIGURED FORM,BY PSYCHEDELICS. ONLY A RENEGADE MYSTIC-MARXIST LIKE WALTER BENJAMIN COULD ALLOWHIMSELF TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTOXICATION AND SOCIAL REALITY,SHOWING HOW THE REPRESSIVE MECHANISMS OF MODERN SOCIETY DEPEND ON ENFORCING THETRANCE OF MODERN LIFE.THE POLITICS OF ECSTASY PROMOTED BY LEARY, GINSBERG, AND OTHERS ONLY CONFUSEDTHE STRAIGHT-EDGE RADICALS OF THE 1960S, WHO WORRIED THAT LSD CREATED FALSECONSCIOUSNESS AND SAPPED ENERGY FROM THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE. “WE FEARED THATUTTER FRIVOLITY WOULD SHORT-CIRCUIT AMERICAN YOUTH’S STILL TENUOUS SENSE OFMORAL OBLIGATION TO THE WORLD’S OPPRESSED,” WROTE TODD GITLIN, FORMER PRESIDENTOF STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, IN HIS BOOK THE SIXTIES: YEARS OF HOPE,DAYS OF RAGE. “THE HIP-YOUTH-DRUG THING, WHATEVER IT WAS, WAS BEYOND OURCONTROL, AND WE MUST HAVE SENSED THAT THE DISCIPLINES OF POLITICS (INCLUDING OUROWN) WERE IN DANGER OF BEING OVERWHELMED.” ON THE OTHER HAND, MANY MOVEMENTSUPPORTERS BECAME RADICALIZED AFTER TRYING MARIJUANA AND LSD. THE FACT THAT THEGOVERNMENT QUICKLY PROHIBITED USE OF THESE SUBSTANCES WAS PROOF TO MANY THAT THERULERS DID NOT HAVE THEIR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.ACID DREAMS SHOWS THAT LIBERATION AND DOMINATION WERE NEVER MORE WEDDED THAN INTHE STORY OF LSD’S RISE AND FALL. WITH LITTLE ROMANTICISM, THE WRITERS DESCRIBELSD AS A “NON-SPECIFIC AMPLIFIER OF PSYCHIC AND SOCIAL PROCESSES.” WHEN CIAAGENTS AND THE MILITARY BECAME FASCINATED WITH THE DRUG IN THE 1950S, DOSINGTHEMSELVES AS WELL AS UNSUSPECTING VICTIMS, MOST OF THEM DID NOT HAVE MYSTICALREVELATIONS. THEY TRIPPED OUT ON BAROQUE JAMES BOND SCENARIOS INSTEAD, SUCH ASPUTTING CHEMICALS IN CASTRO’S SHOES TO MAKE HIS BEARD FALL OUT, ASSASSINATIONPLOTS, OR ENVISIONING BOMBING PATTERNS THROUGH NORTH VIETNAM. LSD MAY HAVE HAD APERMANENT DISTORTING EFFECT ON THE TACTICAL MIND-SET OF THE CIA. LONG AFTER ITSLOVE AFFAIR WITH LSD ENDED, THE CIA REMAINED FASCINATED BY MIND-CONTROL DRUGS,AND FOR MANY YEARS THEY MAINTAINED A SECRET PROJECT IN EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION.ACID DREAMS SUGGESTS THAT, BY THE END OF THE 1960S, THE CIA WORKED COVERTLY TOENSURE THAT A CHEAP SUPPLY OF LSD REMAINED AVAILABLE TO THE RADICALS OF THECOUNTERCULTURE: “ACCORDING TO A FORMER CIA CONTRACT EMPLOYEE, AGENCY PERSONNELHELPED UNDERGROUND CHEMISTS SET UP LSD LABORATORIES IN THE BAY AREA TO ‘MONITOR’EVENTS IN THE ACID GHETTO. . . . A CIA AGENT WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE INFILTRATED THECOVERT LSD NETWORK . . . REFERRED TO HAIGHT-ASHBURY AS A ‘HUMAN GUINEA PIGFARM.’ ”ALONG WITH THE CIA, THE IDEOLOGIES OF RADICAL LEFTIST GROUPS—SUCH AS THE WEATHERUNDERGROUND, THE WHITE PANTHERS, AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS—TURNED INCREASINGLYMILITANT, PARANOID, AND MEGALOMANIACAL UNDER THE EFFECTS OF LSD. “THE DELUSIONSOF GRANDEUR [THE RADICALS] ENTERTAINED WERE AMPLIFIED TO THE POINT THAT SOMEFELT THEMSELVES INVESTED WITH MAGICAL POWERS,” LEE AND SHLAIN WRITE IN ACIDDREAMS. “THEY WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY, OR AT LEAST AS FAST AS LSDCOULD CHANGE A PERSON’S CONSCIOUSNESS.” THEY SUGGEST THAT THE CIAANTICIPATED—WELCOMED, AIDED, AND ABETTED—LSD’S PENETRATION INTO THE RADICALLEFT: “IN THEIR STONED HUBRIS THE YIPPIES, THE WHITE PANTHERS, AND THE WEATHERUNDERGROUND MISREAD THE DEPTH OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON THEPOLITICAL SITUATION IN AMERICA. THEIR DELUSIONS ABOUT THE OMNIPOTENCE OF THEMOVEMENT DERIVED IN PART FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS.”. . .FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER LSD WAS DISCOVERED, ITS POTENTIAL USE ELUDED THEATTEMPTED CATEGORIZATIONS OF SCIENTISTS, SPOOKS, AND SHRINKS. PSYCHOLOGISTSCOULDN’T FATHOM ITS MEANING FOR PSYCHOLOGY ANY BETTER THAN THE CIA COULD FIGUREOUT HOW TO USE IT IN THE SPY TRADE. ACID DID NOT FIT ANY OF THE EXISTINGPARAMETERS. TASTELESS, ODORLESS, WITH DOSES MEASURED IN MICROGRAMS, LSD WAS THEMOST POWERFUL CONSCIOUSNESS-ALTERING SUBSTANCE EVER FOUND BY MANY MAGNITUDES,BUT ITS EFFECTS WERE COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE AND UNREPEATABLE.PSYCHOLOGISTS FIRST USED IT AS A “PSYCHOTOMIMETIC,” A TRAINING TOOL THAT WOULDALLOW THEM TO TEMPORARILY EXPERIENCE PSYCHOTIC OR SCHIZOPHRENIC STATES. BUT THISPROVED UNTENABLE; SINCE THE ALTERED MINDSCAPES OF LSD CAN BE ENJOYED ANDCOMPREHENDED WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHANGES CAUSED BY THE DRUG, ITS EFFECTSARE RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN PSYCHOSIS. BY TRIAL AND ERROR, PSYCHOLOGISTS SLOWLYLEARNED WHAT ANY SHAMAN COULD HAVE TOLD THEM: “SET” AND “SETTING”—THEENVIRONMENT AND THE MENTAL ATTITUDE OF THE USER AT THE START OF THETRIP—DETERMINE THE INDIVIDUAL’S EXPERIENCE OF THE LSD TRIP. IN THE LATE 1950S,SOME PSYCHOLOGISTS STARTED TO USE LSD IN THERAPY WITH ASTONISHING RESULTS.UP UNTIL THE MID-1960S, WHEN THE DRUGS WERE RESTRICTED AND THEN OUTLAWED, THEPSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDS WERE CONSIDERED THE MOST PROMISING TOOLS FOR EXPLORING THEHUMAN MIND THAT PSYCHOLOGY HAD EVER FOUND. MANY OF THE BEST AND MOST INQUISITIVEMINDS IN THE FIELD EMBRACED THIS NEW DIRECTION ENTHUSIASTICALLY. BEFORE LSD WASMADE ILLEGAL, MORE THAN A THOUSAND PAPERS WERE PUBLISHED COVERING SOME FORTYTHOUSAND PATIENTS, RECORDING AMAZING SUCCESSES AND PROFOUND CHALLENGES TO THEPREVAILING MODELS OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE: “EVERY TYPE OF MADNESS, EVERY TYPE OFPARAPSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON, EVERY TYPE OF MYSTICAL, ECSTATIC ILLUMINATION,JUNGIAN ARCHETYPES, PAST LIVES, PRECOGNITION, PSYCHOSIS, SATORI-SAMADHI-ATMAN,UNION WITH GOD,” WRITES STEVENS IN STORMING HEAVEN, “IT WAS ALL THERE IN THESCIENTIFIC RECORD.”BY 1968, THE FDA HAD FORBIDDEN ANY MORE RESEARCH IN PSYCHEDELICS. ALL AROUND THEWORLD, AN IMPREGNABLE BARRIER WAS PLACED AROUND THE SUBJECT, PUTTING IT OUTSIDETHE DOMAIN OF LEGITIMATE SCIENCE. AS DR. STANISLAV GROF, A PIONEER IN LSDPSYCHOTHERAPY AND THEORY, NOTED, “PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH CLARIFIED . . . MANYPREVIOUSLY PUZZLING HISTORICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL DATA CONCERNING SHAMANISM,MYSTERY CULTS, RITES OF PASSAGE, HEALING CEREMONIES, AND PARANORMAL PHENOMENAINVOLVING THE USE OF SACRED PLANTS. . . . THE EXPERIMENTATION WITH PSYCHEDELICDRUGS HAS SHATTERED THE CONVENTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF PSYCHOTHERAPY, THETRADITIONAL MODELS OF THE PSYCHE, THE IMAGE OF HUMAN NATURE, AND EVEN BASICBELIEFS ABOUT THE NATURE OF REALITY.”NOT ONLY MODERN SOCIETY, BUT ALSO MODERN PSYCHIATRY WAS SIMPLY UNREADY FOR SUCHA PARADIGM SHIFT. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE SEEN A RETRENCHMENT AND A RETREAT INTO ANINCREASINGLY NARROW AND NORMATIVE MODEL OF THE PSYCHE. TODAY, MOST PSYCHIATRISTSASSUME THAT MENTAL ILLNESS ALMOST ALWAYS HAS A BIOLOGICAL OR GENETIC BASISRATHER THAN A SOCIAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL OR EVEN SPIRITUAL ORIGIN.THE INTERRUPTED HISTORY OF LSD AND PSILOCYBIN THERAPY INCLUDES TREATMENTPROGRAMS IN WHICH ALCOHOLICS WERE GIVEN SINGLE LARGE DOSES OF LSD, RESULTING INA HIGH RATE OF CURE—AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT, ACCORDING TO DR. HUMPHREY OSMOND, ASCIENTIST WHO HAD DISCOVERED THE STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE MESCALINEMOLECULE AND ADRENALINE IN THE 1950S, AND WHO CONDUCTED CLINICS FOR PSYCHEDELICTHERAPY AT SEVERAL HOSPITALS. EVEN BILL WILSON, THE FOUNDER OF ALCOHOLICSANONYMOUS, RECOGNIZED THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL OF LSD AS A TREATMENT FORCOMPULSIVE DRINKERS. LEARY’S HARVARD PROJECT GAVE PSILOCYBIN TO PRISONERS ATMASSACHUSETTS CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE IN CONCORD, A MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON. THISEXPERIMENT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE. DURING THE CONCORD PROGRAM’SBRIEF LIFE, IT CUT THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR PRISONERS WHO TRIED THE DRUG FROM 80TO 25 PERCENT, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO LEARY’S CALCULATIONS.LEARY CHRONICLES THIS EPISODE IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, FLASHBACKS. IN PRISON FORTHE FIRST TIME, TRIPPING ON PSILOCYBIN WITH A BANK ROBBER, HE WRITES, “I COULDSEE HIM MUCH TOO CLEARLY, EVERY PORE IN HIS FACE, EVERY BLEMISH, THE HAIRS INHIS NOSE, THE HORRID GREEN-YELLOW ENAMEL OF HIS DECAYING TEETH, THE GLISTENINGOF HIS FRIGHTENED EYES, EVERY HAIR ON HIS HEAD LOOKING BIG AS A TREE-BRANCH.”LEARY TOLD THE CONVICT, “I’M AFRAID OF YOU,” AND THE CONVICT ANSWERED, “WELL,THAT’S FUNNY, DOC, ’CAUSE I’M AFRAID OF YOU.” “WHY ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME?” LEARYASKED. “I’M AFRAID OF YOU ’CAUSE YOU’RE A FUCKING MAD SCIENTIST.” AT THAT POINT,LEARY AND THE PRISONER BOTH LAUGHED—A CONNECTION HAD BEEN MADE, “A BIT OF PAGANMAGIC HAD OCCURRED.” FROM THERE ON, ACCORDING TO LEARY, THE PRISON SESSIONS WEREA SUCCESS.A TYPICAL MANIFESTO OF THE PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY MOVEMENT OF THE EARLY 1960SDESCRIBED THE THERAPEUTIC MODEL AS FOLLOWS: “THE SUBJECT CONSTANTLY WORKS OFFREPRESSED MATERIAL AND UNREALITY STRUCTURES, FALSE CONCEPTS, IDEAS, ANDATTITUDES, WHICH HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED THROUGH HIS LIFE EXPERIENCES. THUS A FORMOF PSYCHOLOGICAL CLEANSING SEEMS TO ACCOMPANY THE SUBJECTIVE IMAGERY. . . .GRADUALLY THE SUBJECT COMES TO SEE AND ACCEPT HIMSELF, NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH‘GOOD’ AND ‘BAD’ CHARACTERISTICS, BUT AS ONE WHO SIMPLY IS.” THE AUTHORS OF THISMANIFESTO, LIKE OTHER PSYCHEDELIC THERAPISTS, DID NOT SHY AWAY FROM THESPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF THE LSD ENCOUNTER: THE CENTRAL PERCEPTION, APPARENTLY OF ALL WHO PENETRATE DEEPLY IN THEIREXPLORATIONS, IS THAT BEHIND THE APPARENT MULTIPLICITY OF THINGS IN THE WORLD OFSCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE THERE IS A SINGLE REALITY, IN SPEAKING OF WHICH ITSEEMS APPROPRIATE TO USE SUCH WORDS AS INFINITE AND ETERNAL. AFTER A PATIENT REACHED THIS DEEP PERCEPTION OF ETERNAL UNITY, THE THERAPISTSDISCOVERED, NINE OUT OF TEN TIMES HIS OR HER OTHER PROBLEMS DISAPPEARED. THETRANSCENDENT DIMENSIONS OF THE LSD TRIP ALARMED MOST MAINSTREAM SCIENTISTS, WHOWERE TRAINED TO CONSIDER MYSTICISM AND SCIENCE AS SEPARATE CATEGORIES THATSHOULD NOT OVERLAP.MUCH LIKE PROZAC IN THE 1990S, LSD WAS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL “WONDER DRUG” OF THEEARLY 1960S. LSD THERAPY INSPIRED INSTANT BEST-SELLER ACCOUNTS, SIMILAR TO THEMEMOIRS OF LIFE-CHANGING ENCOUNTERS WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS POPULAR IN RECENTYEARS. CONSTANCE NEWLAND PUBLISHED ME, MYSELF AND I, A CONFESSIONAL ACCOUNT OFHER LSD THERAPY FOR SEXUAL FRIDGITY, IN 1962. NEWLAND, A MIDDLE-AGED WOMANEMERGING FROM THE SEXUAL REPRESSION OF THE 1950S, USED LSD TO FIND HER EROGENOUSZONES (THE FIRST HALLUCINATION SHE HAS IN HER TWENTY-THREE SESSIONS IS OFHERSELF AS A “CLOSED-UP CLAM,” ALONE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR) AND BREAK HER NEUROSIS.THROUGH LSD HALLUCINATIONS, NEWLAND PLUMBED THE DEPTHS OF HER STEREOTYPICALLYFREUDIAN UNCONSCIOUS. BACKTRACKING THROUGH EARLY TRAUMAS, SHE LEARNED, “INADDITION TO BEING, CONSCIOUSLY, A LOVING MOTHER AND RESPECTABLE CITIZEN, I WASALSO, UNCONSCIOUSLY, A MURDERESS, A PERVERT, A CANNIBAL, A SADIST, AND AMASOCHIST.” THESE DISCOVERIES HAD A CHEERING EFFECT ON HER PSYCHIC LIFE. SHE GOTRID OF HER NEUROSIS. “I ALSO ACHIEVED TRANSCENDENT SEXUAL FULFILLMENT.” AFTERTHERAPY, HER LIFE HAD “NEW SAVOR, NEW MEANING, NEW MYSTERY.” NEWLAND’SMASS-MARKET MEMOIR MAKES FOR SURPRISING READING TODAY, WHEN BOTH LSD AND THEFREUDIAN UNCONSCIOUS HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED.. . .IN THE EARLY 1960S, THE AVATARS OF THE NASCENT PSYCHEDELIC MOVEMENT BELIEVEDTHAT LSD COULD RADICALLY CHANGE THE INDIVIDUAL—AND, BY EXTENSION, THE WORLD—BY“DECONDITIONING” PATIENTS FROM LIMITING BELIEFS AND NEUROSES. THE SUPPORTERS OFPSYCHEDELICS THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD A CHANCE TO SHAPE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THESENEW COMPOUNDS, AN OPPORTUNITY THEY SOON LOST. GORDON WASSON, THE INVESTMENTBANKER WHO DISCOVERED THE MAZATEC MUSHROOM CULT, SNOBBISHLY DECREED THAT USE OFTHESE SACRAMENTS HAD NO PLACE AT ALL IN THE MODERN WORLD (EXCEPT WHEN HE TOOKTHEM WITH HIS FRIENDS). ALDOUS HUXLEY, AL HUBBARD, ALAN WATTS, AND MYRONSTOLAROFF, AMONG OTHERS, FAVORED A MANDARIN APPROACH. THEY PLANNED TO DISCREETLYDISTRIBUTE THE DRUGS TO INFLUENTIAL AND WELL-CONNECTED PEOPLE IN BUSINESS, THEARTS, AND GOVERNMENT. “IN THE RELATIVE PRIVACY OF LEARNED JOURNALS, THE DECENTOBSCURITY OF MODERATELY HIGHBROW BOOKS,” ACCORDING TO HUXLEY, THE MANDARINSWOULD SHAPE THE DISCOURSE, THEN LET THE INFORMATION SLOWLY FILTER DOWN THROUGHTHE SOCIETY. BEFORE THEY COULD UNDERTAKE THIS TOP-DOWN INDOCTRINATION, EVENTSOVERTOOK THEM."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26A PATHETIC CLOWN ACTTHE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO CUT THROUGH THE GAME STRUCTURE OF WESTERN LIFE IS THEUSE OF DRUGS.

SINCE THE WASSONS’VISIT TO MARIA SABINA, KNOWLEDGE OF TEONANACATL, THE “FLESH OF GOD,” HAD SPREAD.AN ANTHROPOLOGIST FRIEND OF LEARY’S TRACKED SOME DOWN IN A VILLAGE MARKET.

HE HAD FOUND THE CURE FOR HIS JADED DISILLUSIONMENT AND BOREDOM IN A FISTFUL OFFOUL-TASTING FUNGUS. WHEN HE RETURNED TO HARVARD THAT FALL, HE BEGAN THEPSILOCYBIN PROJECT WITH HIS FELLOW PROFESSOR RICHARD ALPERT (WHO WOULD LATERCHANGE HIS NAME TO RAM DASS), GIVING THE SYNTHESIZED CHEMICAL, PURCHASED THROUGHSANDOZ, TO HUNDREDS OF GRADUATE STUDENTS, HOUSEWIVES, POETS, AND OTHER TESTSUBJECTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENTS AS WELL AS THE METHODOLOGY WERE ALREADYUNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE ADMINISTRATION AT HARVARD IN 1962, WHEN LEARY WASVISITED BY A POT-BELLIED ENGLISHMAN, MICHAEL HOLLINGSHEAD. HOLLINGSHEAD WASCARRYING A JAR OF MAYONNAISE LOADED WITH TEN THOUSAND DOSES OF LSD. FOR A WHILE,LEARY RESISTED THE LURE OF THE MAYONNAISE JAR, BUT FINALLY HE TOOK A SPOONFUL.PROPELLING HIM FAR BEYOND THE REALMS OF “COZY KNOW-THYSELF PSILOCYBIN,” LSDDETONATED HIS EGO: ALL FORMS, ALL STRUCTURES, ALL ORGANISMS, ALL EVENTS WERE TELEVISION PRODUCTIONSPULSING OUT FROM THE CENTRAL EYE. EVERYTHING THAT I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED ANDREAD ABOUT WAS BUBBLE-DANCING BEFORE ME LIKE A NINETEENTH-CENTURY VAUDEVILLESHOW. MY ILLUSIONS, THE COMIC COSTUMES, THE STRANGE EVER-CHANGING STAGE PROPS OFTREES AND BODIES AND THEATER SETS . . . I HAVE NEVER RECOVERED FROM THATONTOLOGICAL CONFRONTATION. AFTER LSD, LEARY REALIZED LATER, “IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT WE WOULD LEAVE HARVARD,THAT WE WOULD LEAVE AMERICAN SOCIETY.”I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED LEARY A CENTRAL VILLAIN IN THE PSYCHEDELIC SAGA. HE WASCERTAINLY NAIVE, CHARISMATIC, SLOPPY, SELF-PROMOTIONAL, AND OUT OF CONTROL.OTHER RESEARCHERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS—STANISLAV GROF, MYRON STOLAROFF, AND OSCARJANIGER AMONG OTHERS—MANY OF WHOM HAD WORKED WITH PSYCHEDELICS FOR YEARS BEFORELEARY JUMPED INTO THE FRAY, HAD INTENTIONALLY MAINTAINED A LOW PROFILE. THEYRECOGNIZED THE POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY AND PARADIGM-SHIFTING NATURE OF THEIRWORK, AND REALIZED THAT THEY HAD TO GO SLOWLY OR FACE EXPULSION FROM THEMAINSTREAM. LEARY, A LATECOMER TO PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH, MADE THAT CAUTIOUSSTRATEGY IMPOSSIBLE.INSPIRED BY ALLEN GINSBERG BUT ABOVE ALL FOLLOWING HIS OWN FLASHY TEMPERAMENT,LEARY CHOSE TO MASS-MARKET CHEMICAL MIND EXPANSION, USING THE MEDIA TO SPREADTHE LSD MESSAGE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. LIKE THE OTHER PSYCHEDELIC THERAPISTS, HEENVISIONED USING PSYCHEDELICS IN A PROFESSIONAL AND GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONEDCONTEXT. HE ADVOCATED GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS ON PSYCHEDELIC USE, AND THETRAINING OF OFFICIAL GUIDES, BOTH MYSTICS AND THERAPISTS. IN A SENSE, LEARY ANDHIS SUPPORTERS ENVISIONED A NEW TYPE OF PROFESSIONAL SHAMAN, ONE WHO WOULD BETRAINED TO UTILIZE THE PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS AS TOOLS FOR PSYCHIC TRANSFORMATION.COULD PSYCHEDELIC SHAMANISM FLOURISH IN A MODERN BUREAUCRACY, AS A REGULATEDPROFESSION? COULD THE WEST INSTITUTIONALIZE PSYCHEDELIC EXPLORATION RATHER THANFORBID IT? PERHAPS WE WILL NEVER KNOW IF SUCH AN EFFORT MIGHT SUCCEED—OR PERHAPSWE WILL. CURRENTLY, EUROPEAN DRUG LAWS ARE BEING LIBERALIZED AT AN ASTONISHINGRATE. EVEN IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS RECENTLYAPPROVED A PILOT STUDY USING ECSTASY IN TREATMENT OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESSDISORDER, ALONG WITH TRIALS OF PSILOCYBIN FOR TREATING OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVEDISORDER.OR IS THE TRUE SHAMANIC IMPULSE TOO ANARCHIC TO BE EXPRESSED IN THAT INTRICATE“SOCIAL FABRICATION” THAT IS OUR POSTMODERN WORLD? AS KEN KESEY PUT IT, “THEPURPOSE OF PSYCHEDELICS IS TO LEARN THE CONDITIONED RESPONSES OF PEOPLE AND THENTO PRANK THEM. THAT’S THE ONLY WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS, AND UNTILTHEY ASK QUESTIONS THEY’RE GOING TO REMAIN CONDITIONED ROBOTS.” KESEY’S APPROACHWAS MORE RADICAL—LESS THERAPEUTIC BUT PERHAPS MORE SHAMANIC—THAN LEARY’S. FORKESEY, WHO FIRST TASTED LSD AS A RESEARCH SUBJECT, AND HIS PRANKSTER FOLLOWERSIN THEIR MAGIC BUS, TAKING LSD HAD A “REVOLT OF THE GUINEA PIGS”ANTIAUTHORITARIAN EDGE. THEIR MOTTO WAS “FREAK FREELY.” WHEN THE MERRYPRANKSTERS VISITED LEARY AND HIS ACOLYTES AT THE LUXURIOUS MILBROOK ESTATE, THEYFOUND LEARY’S USE OF BACH, MEDITATION ROOMS, AND THE PSEUDORELIGIOUS VIBEDISTASTEFUL. THEY DUBBED HIS BRAND OF HIGH-BROW PSYCHEDELIA THE “CRYPT TRIP.”IN THE YEARS AFTER HARVARD DISMISSED HIM, LEARY’S PRONOUNCEMENTS BECAMEINCREASINGLY STRIDENT. HIS EGO AMPED-UP BY EXCESSIVE EXPLORATION OF LSD, HE USEDTHE MASS MEDIA TO DISSEMINATE FRIGHTENING AND RADICAL MESSAGES THAT CAUSED APREDICTABLE PANIC REACTION: “I WOULD SAY THAT AT PRESENT OUR SOCIETY IS SOINSANE, THAT EVEN IF THE RISKS WERE FIFTY-FIFTY THAT IF YOU TOOK LSD YOU WOULDBE PERMANENTLY INSANE, I STILL THINK THAT THE RISK IS WORTH TAKING, AS LONG ASTHE PERSON KNOWS THAT THAT’S THE RISK,” HE TOLD AN INTERVIEWER AT THE HEIGHT OFHIS INFAMY.AS THE SELF-APPOINTED POWER-TRIPPING “HIGH PRIEST” OF LSD, LEARY USED THE SAMEMECHANISMS OF GAME-PLAYING AND IMAGE MANIPULATION THAT ALLOWED HIM TO FLOURISHIN THE PREPSYCHEDELIC BUTTONED-DOWN AMBIENCE OF 1950S HARVARD. UNSURPRISINGLY,WHENEVER LEARY TOOK LSD, HE SAID HE RELIVED A “RECURRING SCIENCE FICTIONPARANOIA. SUDDENLY I AM ON CAMERA IN AN ANCIENT TELEVISION SHOW. . . . ALL MYLIFE ROUTINES A PATHETIC CLOWN ACT.”LEARY INSISTED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA USE THE LSD TRIP AS PROGRAMMEDEGO DESTRUCTION, WITH THE AID OF HIS SUPERFICIAL REWRITE OF THE TIBETAN BOOK OFTHE DEAD. HE CONFIDENTLY PROCLAIMED A REDUCTIVE SIX-WORD MOTTO AS A DIRECTIVEFOR CONFUSED TEENAGERS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS: “TURN ON, TUNE IN, DROP OUT.”INTOXICATED BY HIS SENSE OF SELF-IMPORTANCE, LEARY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THATTHERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FORTY-YEAR-OLD HARVARD PSYCHOLOGIST CHOOSING TOABANDON HIS SOCIETAL ROLE, AND A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KID MAKING THE SAME DECISION.THE SMASHING OF THE EGO THAT LEARY ADVOCATED WAS, FOR MANY TRIPPERS, A VICIOUSLYNIHILISTIC QUEST. LEARY’S SLICK, SUPERFICIAL CONSTRUCTS LACKED THE DEEPFRAMEWORK OF SEPARATION, TRANSCENDENCE, AND REINTEGRATION THAT SHAMANIC CULTURESHAD DEVELOPED OVER 75,000 (GIVE OR TAKE) YEARS. THE “HIGH PRIEST” OF PSYCHEDELIALED HIS ACOLYTES ASTRAY, ABANDONING THEM TO FLOAT IN A MIND-BLOWN VOID. JOHNLENNON WAS ONE OF LEARY’S CASUALTIES. LENNON TRIPPED ON LSD OVER A THOUSANDTIMES IN THE LATE 1960S, LEADING TO A LONG PERIOD OF INACTIVITY. “I GOT AMESSAGE ON ACID THAT YOU SHOULD DESTROY YOUR EGO,” HE ADMITTED LATER. “I WASREADING THAT STUPID BOOK OF LEARY’S AND ALL THAT SHIT. WE WERE GOING THROUGH AWHOLE GAME THAT EVERYONE WENT THROUGH, AND I DESTROYED MYSELF.”LEARY, LIKE MOST OF THE AVATARS OF THE EARLY PSYCHEDELIC MOVEMENT, SAW THE VALUEOF PSYCHEDELICS AS DECONDITIONING AND DEPROGRAMMING AGENTS. PSYCHEDELICS ALLOWUSERS TO “UNHOOK THE AMBITIONS AND THE SYMBOLIC DRIVES AND THE MENTALCONNECTIONS WHICH KEEP YOU ADDICTED AND TIED TO THE IMMEDIATE TRIBAL GAME.” THEYBREAK THE TRANCE OF THE CONSENSUS CULTURE. BUT NEITHER LSD NOR LEARY COULDPROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE MOST PROFOUND ISSUE EXPOSED BY THE LSD TRIP: ONCE THEINDIVIDUAL EGO WAS LIBERATED FROM ITS SOCIAL ROLE, FROM THE WELL-WORN GROOVES OFWESTERN SOCIETY’S GAME MACHINERY, WHAT WAS IT SUPPOSED TO DO?THIS AGONIZING QUESTION IS REFRACTED, REVERBED, AND WA-WA PEDALED THROUGH THEPSYCHEDELIC ROCK OF THAT ERA. PSYCHEDELIC ROCK OSCILLATES BETWEEN CONTRASTINGIMPULSES. THERE IS THE DIONYSIAN DESIRE TO PULVERIZE ALL THE BOUNDARIES OF SPACEAND TIME—JIMI HENDRIX’S YEARNING TO KISS THE SKY, OR CHOP DOWN A MOUNTAIN WITHTHE SIDE OF HIS HAND. BUT THE FEELING OF MAGIC SUPER-POTENCY IS COUNTERED BY ITSOPPOSITE, A CHILDLIKE HELPLESSNESS, FOUND IN THE NURSERY RHYME PASTORALISM OFPINK FLOYD’S “SEE EMILY PLAY” OR THE BEATLES’ “MOTHER NATURE’S SON.”PSYCHEDELIC ROCK REACHED ITS UNFORTUNATE ENDPOINT IN DISTORTED SOUNDSCAPES OFPSYCHIC DISINTEGRATION, PRETENTIOUSLY ADOLESCENT FANTASIAS SUCH AS THE BEATLES’“REVOLUTION NUMBER NINE,” LATE-1960S PINK FLOYD, AND THE DOORS. THE MUSIC TRACESTHE SORROWFUL PROCESS OF PSYCHIC DECAY, SWIRLING DOWN TOWARD WHAT FREUD CALLED“THE OCEANIC,” A ZONE OF PREINFANTILE UNDIFFERENTIATION. THE RECORDS DESCRIBEFAILED ATTEMPTS AT INITIATION—SHORT-CIRCUITED BLOW OUTS, MADE WITHOUT ROAD MAPOR GUIDE, EXCEPT FOR LEARY’S DANGEROUS MANUAL.PERCEIVED AS AVATARS OF A NEW AND POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY ROMANTICISM, THEROCK STARS OF THAT ERA EAGERLY EMBRACED THEIR ROLE. SID BARRETT, JIMI HENDRIX,JANIS JOPLIN, BRIAN JONES, JIM MORRISON, AND BRIAN WILSON WERE AMONG THOSE WHODESTROYED THEMSELVES, PHYSICALLY OR PSYCHICALLY, THROUGH MESSY ORGIES OFNARCOTIC EXCESS AND SHAMANIC REGRESS. IN THEIR PUBLIC FLAME-OUTS, THEY ACTED OUTTHE CRISIS OF THEIR GENERATION. THEY USED DRUGS TO PUSH THEIR PERCEPTIONS,DECONDITION THEIR EGOS, BUT FOUND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO RETURN TO “CONSENSUALREALITY.”THE 1960S PURSUIT OF SHAMANIC KNOWLEDGE WAS TOO SHALLOW, TOO UNINFORMED, TOSUCCEED. PRODUCTS OF A CONSUMER CULTURE, THE HIPPIES AND FLOWER CHILDREN TENDEDTO TREAT PSYCHEDELICS AND SPIRITUALITY AS NEW COMMODITIES. FOOLED BY THEIMMEDIATE PSYCHIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF LSD, THEY THOUGHT ENLIGHTENMENT COULD BEQUICKLY ACHIEVED. INSTEAD, TRIPPING WITHOUT SHAMANIC SUPPORT, AND FOR KICKS,SOME OF THEM INDUCED IN THEMSELVES WHAT THE MAZATECS CALL “MINDSHADOWS”—NEGATIVE SPIRITUAL ENERGY—AND THESE MIND SHADOWS, LIKE DESTRUCTIVEDEMONS, COMPELLED THEM INTO DARK PHANTASMAL REALMS.THE PSYCHEDELIC CULTURE FLOURISHED FOR A FEW SHORT YEARS, LEAVING BEHIND ACHAOTIC LEGACY OF SHORT-CIRCUITED BRILLIANCE AND SCHIZOID TRAGEDY. SOMEFIGURES—ALLEN GINSBERG, BOB DYLAN, AND ABBIE HOFFMAN—CAPTURED THE HALLUCINATORYMOMENT IN ALL ITS CARNIVAL URGENCY. GINSBERG’S SYNESTHETIC WORDPLAY—“REALITYSANDWICHES,” “HYDROGEN JUKEBOX,” ETCETERA—MIMICKED THE SENSORY DISTORTIONS OFHALLUCINOGENS. DYLAN’S LSD-INSPIRED SONGS FROM THE MID-1960S PRESENT MENTALDREAMSCAPES OR STAGE SETS, WHERE MYTHIC FIGURES AND ARCHETYPES INTERACT WITHFLOATING FRAGMENTS OF THE REAL WORLD. ON PEYOTE, GINSBERG SAW VISIONS OF AWORLD-DESTROYING MOLOCH; ON LSD HE MET A MILLION-EYED MONSTER. DYLAN’SPSYCHEDELIA WAS EQUALLY CAUSTIC AND HARD-EDGED. HE DESCRIBED DRINKING A POTION,A MIXTURE OF “TEXAS MEDICINE” AND “RAILROAD GIN”: AN’ LIKE A FOOL I MIXED THEMAN’ IT SCRAMBLED UP MY MINDAN’ NOW PEOPLE JUST GET UGLIERAN’ I HAVE NO SENSE OF TIME ABBIE HOFFMAN’S LSD-INSPIRED INSIGHT WAS TO TAKE THE LOGIC OF GINSBERG’S SURREALPOETRY AND TRANSFORM IT INTO DIRECT ACTIONS, MEDIA EVENTS THAT MOCKED ANDUNDERMINED THE STRUCTURING LOGIC OF CAPITALISM. ACID TAUGHT HIM THAT “ACTION WASTHE ONLY REALITY.” WHEN THE YIPPIES BURNED MONEY ON WALL STREET IT WAS A REVERSEMAGIC TRICK IN WHICH THEY TOOK THE DOLLAR’S SYMBOLIC VALUE AND NULLIFIED IT,TURNING BILLS BACK INTO PAPER SCRAPS, MOCKING MONEY’S OCCULT POWER.LSD SPARKED GENIUS—KEN KESEY’S ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO’S NEST WAS INSPIRED BYTRIPS, THE BLACK HUMOR OF PYNCHON HAD A DISTINCT PSYCHEDELIC TINGE, THECARTOONIST R. CRUMB FOUND HIS SIGNATURE STYLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF “FUZZYACID”—AND IT ALSO RUINED MINDS. THE ERA LEFT BEHIND A NUMBER OF STARKPSYCHOANALYTIC SELF-PORTRAITS, ANATOMIZING THE PHASES OF PSYCHEDELIC BREAKDOWN,PARANOIA, AND REGRESSION.THE LATE 1960S WERE THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE PARANOID STRAIN IN AMERICAN LIFE. ASTHOMAS PYNCHON PUT IT, THE ERA INDUCED “A DELIRIUM TREMENS, A TREMBLINGUNFURROWING OF THE MIND’S PLOWSHARES.” BY THE END OF THE DECADE, HALLUCINATORYHYSTERIA AND CONSENSUAL REALITY MERGED INTO AN INDISSOLUBLE WHOLE, AND THEY HAVENEVER SEPARATED SINCE. IT WAS AN ERA OF MESSIANIC FANTASIES, VIOLENT ACTS, ANDADOLESCENT RAGES, OF SURGES TOWARD LIBERATION AND FIZZLES INTO MADNESS. THETHRUST OF IT WAS A QUEST FOR INITIATION—AN ATTEMPT, IN GINSBERG’S WORDS, “TORESURRECT A LOST ART OR A LOST KNOWLEDGE OR A LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.” THE GOAL WASTO RESTORE A LIVING KNOWLEDGE OF THE SACRED TO THE DAZED AND ALIENATED DENIZENSOF A DESACRALIZED MODERN WORLD.PSYCHEDELICS INSPIRED THE DREAM OF A MASS SOCIAL REWIRING, TOWARD A NEW ORDERBASED ON SPIRITUALITY, SEXUALITY, AND A RETURN TO ARCADIAN NATURE (THE YIPPIEMOVEMENT DEMANDED “COMPULSORY UNEMPLOYMENT FOR EVERYONE. LET THE MACHINES DOIT.”). THE FAILURE OF THIS IDEALISTIC VISION OF SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION WAS ATEMPORARY VICTORY FOR THE COMMODITY CULTURE, WHICH CO-OPTED THE MESMERIZINGIMAGERY OF HALLUCINOGENS INTO ITS TECHNIQUES OF MARKETING AND PROMOTION,REPACKAGING PSYCHEDELIA AS ANOTHER SELLING TOOL, STRIPPED OF ALL CONTENT. IT ISSTILL VISIBLE IN THE SWIRLING GRAPHICS USED IN ENDLESS CAR AND E-COMMERCEADVERTISEMENTS TODAY.HUNTER S. THOMPSON’S FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS CAPTURED AND HELPED TODEFINE THE POST SIXTIES HIPSTER ATTITUDE TOWARD DRUGS: “WHAT SELLS, TODAY, ISWHATEVER FUCKS YOU UP—WHATEVER SHORTCIRCUITS YOUR BRAIN AND GROUNDS IT OUT FORTHE LONGEST POSSIBLE TIME,” HE WROTE IN 1972. “THE GHETTO MARKET HAS MUSHROOMEDINTO SUBURBIA.” THOMPSON INSPIRED GENERATIONS OF PREPPY SELF-ABUSERS. HE DEFINEDTHE NEW ERA’S JADED ATTITUDE TOWARD CHEMICAL MIND-EXPANSION: THIS WAS THE FATAL FLAW IN TIM LEARY’S TRIP. HE CRASHED AROUND AMERICA SELLING“CONSCIOUSNESS EXPANSION” WITHOUT EVER GIVING A THOUGHT TO THE GRIM MEAT-HOOKREALITIES THAT WERE LYING IN WAIT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK HIM TOO SERIOUSLY. . . BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH SATISFACTION IN KNOWING THAT HE BLEW IT VERY BADLYFOR HIMSELF, BECAUSE HE TOOK SO MANY OTHERS DOWN WITH HIM.NOT THAT THEY DIDN’T DESERVE IT: NO DOUBT THEY ALL GOT WHAT WAS COMING TO THEM.ALL THOSE PATHETICALLY EAGER ACID FREAKS WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD BUY PEACE ANDUNDERSTANDING FOR THREE BUCKS A HIT. BUT THEIR LOSS AND FAILURE IS OURS, TOO.WHAT LEARY TOOK DOWN WITH HIM WAS THE CENTRAL ILLUSION OF A WHOLE LIFE-STYLETHAT HE HELPED TO CREATE . . . A GENERATION OF PERMANENT CRIPPLES, FAILEDSEEKERS, WHO NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENTIAL AGE-OLD MYSTIC FALLACY OF THE ACIDCULTURE: THE DESPERATE ASSUMPTION THAT SOMEBODY—OR AT LEAST SOME FORCE—ISTENDING THAT LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. THOMPSON’S CYNICISM WAS COOL AND PROTO-PUNK, AN EASY ATTITUDE FOR FUTUREGENERATIONS TO COP. BUT THE FAULT IN HIS ARGUMENT GOES FAR DEEPER THAN LEARY’S.IF WE DON’T EXPLORE THE NATURE OF OUR MINDS AS DEEPLY AS POSSIBLE, USINGWHATEVER TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO US, WHAT KIND OF WORLD CAN WE HOPE TO CREATE?WHAT KIND OF WORLD ARE WE CREATING NOW?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27THE LIGHT AT THEEND OF THE TUNNELTHOSE WHO USE (LSD) FREQUENTLY OR CHRONICALLY ALMOST INEVITABLY WITHDRAW FROMSOCIETY AND ENTER INTO A SOLIPSISTIC, NEGATIVISTIC EXISTENCE.

I ALSO WROTE, “AS IF EVERY MOMENT IS RECORDED AND PLAYEDBACK INFINITELY—AND IT NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.”IN THE PREDAWN HOURS, SITTING BENEATH THE VAST ORANGE-COLORED LIMBS OF THEBRIDGE, HEARING ITS DEEP ELECTRIC REVERBERATIONS, I CONTINUED TO STARE, AS IFMESMERIZED, AT THE SLIDING SURFACES OF SILVER WATER, THE LUMINOUS WHIRLS ANDTUMBLES, WHILE IN MY THOUGHTS I REVIEWED THE PATTERNS AND FORCES, PSYCHIC ANDIMPERSONAL, GEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND MYSTICAL, THE OLD AND NEWCURRENTS OF HISTORY AND FATE THAT HAD BROUGHT ME TO THAT POINT IN TIME—ALL OFTHESE FORCES REPRESENTED BY THE CURRENTS SHIFTING ACROSS THE RIVER LIKE RIPPLINGGLASS, THE GRAFFITI-STREWN ROCKS BELOW, THE EXPANSE OF STEEL ABOVE—UNTIL THETOTALITY OF THE AWARENESS SNUFFED ME, FOR ONE MOMENT, LIKE A CANDLE FLAME BLOWNOUT BY THE WIND.THIS SUDDEN SATORI WAS A BEAUTIFUL SHOCK. I MERGED WITH THE FULLNESS, THEEMPTINESS—THEN CAME BACK INTO MYSELF AGAIN. FOR THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED THEBUDDHIST PARADOX THAT EXPANSION OF AWARENESS TO A HIGHER POINT WASSIMULTANEOUSLY THE VANISHING OF AWARENESS, THE FUSING OF SELF INTO COSMOS.AT ANOTHER POINT I WAS AWARE—SHADES OF THE RAPID DMT TRANSPORT—OF THE ENTIRESENTIENT SYSTEM RUNNING ME. WITH THE MEREST FLICK OF A SWITCH IT COULD TURN MEON OR OFF ANY TIME IT WANTED. IT WARNED ME OF THIS. HUMBLED AND GRATEFUL, ITHANKED THE SELF-WEAVING COSMOLOGICAL FIRMAMENT FOR ALLOWING ME, PUNY STRAND OFSPIRIT-STUFF, TO BE SPUN IN ITS LOOM. I OFTEN PASS THROUGH SUCH AN OLD TESTAMENTGOD PHASE OF THE LSD TRIP—A PROGRAM RUNNING BEFORE OR AFTER THE SWARMING,MULTITENTACLED, MILLION-EYED HINDU/BUDDHIST WRATHFUL DEITY SECTION, WHICH ISALSO STANDARD FARE.I CLOSED MY EYES AND HALLUCINATORY REALMS SWARMED INTO VIEW. JAPANESE PAGODADRAGONS SHOOK THEIR RAINBOW-COLORED MANES AND IGUANA TAILS. I SPIED INTO STRANGE1960S-FEELING WHITE-MOLDED PLASTIC AND WALL-TO-WALL MIRROR SCENES OF INHUMAN SEXTRANSGRESSIONS, RESEMBLING ITALIAN PORN PRODUCED BY AN ALIEN RACE—SUCCULENT PINKAND RED ORGANIC FORMS FUSING AND UNDULATING. I VISITED AN EXTRADIMENSIONALSWITCHBOARD, LIKE THE SILICON INTERIOR OF A COMPUTER’S MEMORY, WHERE, EVERYSECOND, A MILLION WIRES WERE SLOTTED INTO NEW SOCKETS.I REQUESTED SOME ANCESTRAL JUDAIC WISDOM, AND SUDDENLY, ON CUE AND AS IF INMOCKERY OF MY DESIRES, A HIGH-SPEED STREAM OF SACRED HEBREW LETTERS POURED FORTHFROM A FUNNEL-SHAPED GEOMETRIC MANDALA. THE LETTERS WERE FOLLOWED BY JEWISHSTARS, TREES OF LIFE, STREAMS OF GOLDEN LIGHT. SUDDENLY, THE MYSTICAL SIGNSVANISHED TO BE REPLACED BY A HORDE OF BLACK CATS, EACH PERFECTLY RENDERED WITHIDENTICAL GLITTERING EYES. THE BLACK CATS FILLED UP EVERYTHING UNTIL I WASLOOKING AT BLACK CAT WALLPAPER, A UNIVERSE OF BLACK CATS.I OPENED MY EYES. LSD THROWS OPEN THE GATES TO THE PLEROMA, THE GNOSTIC REALM OFCOSMIC SUPERABUNDANCE. THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT POURS THROUGH THOSE GATES ISOVERWHELMING AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ANNOYINGLY TRIVIAL AND SOULLESS.HAVING FINISHED MY INTROSPECTIVE ORGY, I RETURNED TO MY PLAN: AN ATTEMPT TOFATHOM THE NATURE OF LSD FROM INSIDE THE LSD TRIP.I WALKED BACK TOWARD THE DANCERS, THEIR MOVEMENTS A SPINDLY ROBOT POETRY IN THECRISP PREDAWN. THEY WERE SWAYING TO SCRITCHY-SCRATCHY PATTERNS OF TRANCE MUSICUNDERNEATH A SCREEN OF PROJECTED VIDEO SHOWING SWARMING RHIZOMES AND FLIMMERINGSCENES FROM THE COLLECTIVE PSYCHEDELIC UNCONSCIOUS—THE VISUAL KITSCH OF THETRANCE WORLD. I LAY DOWN ON A BLANKET AND CLOSED MY EYES AGAIN. IMMEDIATELY,MULTICOLORED GEOMETRIES OVERLAID MY INTERIOR VIEW SCREEN, SPINNING AND CHANGINGAT HYPERSPEED.WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THESE PATTERNS AND HYPERREAL HALLUCINATORY FORMS? THEPALLID SCIENTIFIC THESIS—THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY SELF-GENERATED BY-PRODUCTS OF ANOVERSTIMULATION OF THE NEOCORTEX—DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ORGANIZED PRECISION.THEY WERE AS FULLY REALIZED AS THE DATA SEEN IN THE EYES-OPENED WORLD.WHILE TRIPPING, I REVIEWED THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE DISCOVERY OF LSD. IN 1938,A SWISS CHEMIST, ALBERT HOFMANN, WAS WORKING FOR SANDOZ, A PHARMACEUTICALCOMPANY. HOFMANN’S ASSIGNMENT WAS TO SYNTHESIZE A SERIES OF DERIVATIVES OFERGOT, A FUNGUS GROWING ON WHEAT—IN OTHER WORDS, A MUSHROOM. SANDOZ WAS LOOKINGFOR COMPOUNDS THAT INDUCED MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS. ERGOT HAS A LONG HISTORY OFHUMAN USE. FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PERHAPS, MIDWIVES AND WISE WOMEN HAVE USEDERGOT FOR ITS ABILITY TO INDUCE LABOR. BUT ERGOT WAS ALSO THE SOURCE OF SAINTVITUS’ DANCE, A VIOLENT DISEASE CAUSING DESCENTS INTO MADNESS AND DEATH THATSTRUCK LIKE A PLAGUE WHEN A VILLAGE OR REGION UNSUSPECTEDLY ATE BREAD MADE FROMERGOT-INFECTED WHEAT. IN OTHER WORDS, LIKE THE HISTORY OF LSD ITSELF, ERGOT’SINTERACTION WITH HUMANITY HAD POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS. LSD AND ERGOT WEREAMBIGUOUS TOOLS.LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE WAS LSD-25, THE TWENTY-FIFTH IN A SERIES OF SYNTHESESTHAT HOFMANN MADE FROM ERGOT. THE COMPOUND WAS TESTED ON ANIMALS. IT SEEMED TOHAVE NO USEFUL EFFECTS, AND IT WAS SHELVED, ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHERUSELESS COMPOUNDS, SEEMINGLY PERMANENTLY. HOFMANN, HOWEVER, COULD NOT FORGETTHIS PARTICULAR CHEMICAL. HE HAD DREAMS ABOUT IT AND WHAT HE RECALLED AS “APECULIAR PRESENTIMENT.” SOMETHING ABOUT ITS MOLECULAR STRUCTURE COMPELLED HIM TOREMAKE IT—THE ONLY TIME HE HAD RESYNTHESIZED A COMPOUND THAT SHOWED NO PROMISE.FIVE YEARS LATER, IN 1943, HE MADE A NEW BATCH OF LSD-25 IN HIS LABORATORY INBASEL. SOMEHOW, HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED, HE EITHER INGESTED A SMALLAMOUNT OF THE SUBSTANCE OR GOT SOME ON HIS SKIN, AND HE WAS PROPELLED ON THEFIRST ACID TRIP. LYING ON HIS COUCH, HE WATCHED A “STREAM OF FANTASTIC IMAGES OFEXTRAORDINARY PLASTICITY AND VIVIDNESS AND ACCOMPANIED BY AN INTENSEKALEIDOSCOPIC PLAY OF COLORS.” HE ASSUMED HE HAD GONE MAD. A FEW DAYS LATER, HEDECIDED TO INTENTIONALLY TEST LSD’S PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ANDINGESTED WHAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE A MINUTE AMOUNT—TOO LITTLE TO AFFECT HIM—BUTWAS, IN FACT, A WHOPPING DOSE: 250 MICROGRAMS. AFTER A NOW-LEGENDARY BICYCLERIDE BACK TO HIS HOME, HE FOUND HIMSELF HOVERING ON HIS CEILING, STARING DOWN ATHIS OWN BODY, CONVINCED THAT HE HAD DIED.WHY WOULD A CHEMIST GO BACK AND RESYNTHESIZE, FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FACT, ONE OFTHOUSANDS OF COMPOUNDS HE HAD MADE, ONE THAT HIS COMPANY HAD ALREADY DISMISSEDAS HAVING NO VALUE? AND HOW STRANGE THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN 1943, IN THECENTER OF EUROPE, AS THE NAZIS GEARED UP FOR THE SYSTEMATIC DEPLOYMENT OF THEFINAL SOLUTION. MOST PECULIAR, PERHAPS, IS THAT THE DISCOVERY OF LSD WOULDHAPPEN ONLY A YEAR AFTER NUCLEAR FISSION WAS DEMONSTRATED, AND AS THE FIRSTATOMIC BOMBS WENT INTO DEVELOPMENT.BEFORE HE RETURNED TO IT, HOFMANN DREAMT REPEATEDLY OF THE MOLECULAR STRUCTUREOF LSD-25. IN THE ANNALS OF SCIENCE, IT IS NOTABLE THAT MANY SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTSFIRST APPEAR IN DREAMS AND VISIONS. THE GERMAN CHEMIST FRIEDRICH KEKULE, FORINSTANCE, DREAMT OF A SNAKE WITH ITS TAIL IN ITS MOUTH, AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THEMOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF BENZENE WAS A CLOSED CARBON RING. THE FRENCHMATHEMATICIAN JULES-HENRI POINCARÉ, DURING A SLEEPLESS NIGHT, SAW MATHEMATICALSYMBOLS COLLIDING UNTIL THEY COALESCED INTO EQUATIONS. THESE INTUITIVE LEVELS OFINSIGHT, WHETHER SCIENTIFIC OR ARTISTIC, FUNCTION LIKE THE PROPHETIC DREAMS OFSHAMANS, OR LIKE THE TEACHINGS, THE “MIND TREASURES,” THAT TIBETAN LAMASSOMETIMES RECEIVE FROM PREDECESSORS WHO HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDSOF YEARS, THROUGH CONSCIOUS DREAMS. ACCORDING TO THE PHYSICIST DAVID BOHM, THENATURE OF INSIGHT REMAINS BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING. “THE INSIGHT IS PROBABLYFROM IMMENSE DEPTHS OF SUBTLETY—PERHAPS EVEN BEYOND THE ORGANISM FOR ALL WEKNOW,” HE SAID. “THE REFLEX OF THOUGHT IS CONTINUALLY RESISTING AND DEFENDINGAGAINST IT, BECAUSE THE INSIGHT MAY BE SEEN AS A THREAT TO THE STRUCTURE WHICHYOU WANT TO HOLD.” HOFMANN’S DISCOVERY OF LSD WAS THAT KIND OF INSIGHT—A FLASHFROM A DEEPER ORDER OF THE SELF OR, PERHAPS, FROM OUTSIDE THE SELF ENTIRELY.WHEN I ARRIVED IN GABON, I HAD ASKED LIEBERMAN HOW THE BWITI THOUGHT OF IBOGA. IWAS TOLD THEY CONSIDERED IT “A SUPERCONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL ENTITY THAT GUIDESMANKIND.” AT THE TIME, OF COURSE, I DISMISSED THIS AS IMPOSSIBLE. LATER, I WASNOT SO SURE. DURING THE IBOGA TRIP, IT SEEMED THAT SOMETHING—SOMETHING I COULDONLY DESCRIBE AS A FORCE OR EVEN AN ENTITY—TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND LED METHROUGH MY ENTIRE LIFE UP TO THAT POINT. THIS BEING SEEMED ABLE TO NAVIGATETHROUGH TIME AND TO ORGANIZE THE DATA FROM THE HOLOGRAPHIC INDEX OF MY MEMORIESAS EASILY AS I MIGHT WALK AROUND THE ART IN A MUSEUM HALL. I RECALLED THE FACTTHAT I HAD SEEN A GOLEMLIKE STATUE CARVED FROM WOOD, AND A BWITI SHAMAN HADASSURED ME THAT THIS WAS THE SPIRIT OF IBOGA ITSELF, “COMING OUT TO ENGAGE YOUIN CONVERSATION.”WHAT IF IT WAS LITERALLY TRUE?WHAT IF IBOGA WAS A SENTIENT BEING, A SPIRIT, OR AN EXTRADIMENSIONALINTELLIGENCE INVOLVED IN HUMAN AFFAIRS?TERENCE MCKENNA, IN HIS BOOK FOOD OF THE GODS, EXPLORED THE HISTORY OF THERELATION BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS AND PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS. HE DESCRIBEDHALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS AS “REPOSITORIES OF LIVING VEGETABLE GNOSIS.” LIKE THEBWITI, HE ACCEPTED THE SHAMANIC NOTION THAT THESE PLANTS ARE WAYS OF CONTACTINGHIGHER DIMENSIONAL ENTITIES DISPOSED, IN A MORE OR LESS FRIENDLY FASHION, TOWARDTHE HUMAN ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS. HE WROTE; “BY ENTERING THEDOMAIN OF PLANT INTELLIGENCE, THE SHAMAN BECOMES, IN A WAY, PRIVILEGED BY AHIGHER DIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON EXPERIENCE.”PERHAPS EATING THE IBOGA BARK SOMEHOW LINKED ME TO A “SPIRITUAL ENTITY” ABLE TOACCESS AND EXPOSE THE HIDDEN MATRIX OF MY LIFE WITH SUCH INTENTIONALITY BECAUSEIT WAS, IN SOME WAY, AN EXTRADIMENSIONAL BEING, THEREFORE NOT BOUND BY OUR LAWSOF SPACE AND TIME. PSILOCYBIN AND MESCALINE WERE ALSO CHEMICAL CATALYSTS OF THISKIND—THE INDIANS EVEN SAID THAT “PEYOTE WAS A PLANT THAT SEES IN SIXDIMENSIONS.”MCKENNA SUSPECTED THAT AN ARCHAIC PARTNERSHIP WITH HALLUCINOGENIC MUSHROOMSMIGHT HAVE CATALYZED THE HUMAN ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGE, AS WELL AS BEING THEBASIS OF THE RELIGIOUS IMPULSE IN MAN. HE ALSO SPECULATED THAT THE ALKALOIDSEXTRUDED BY THESE PLANTS MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE “EXOPHEROMONES,” CHEMICALSCREATED BY ONE SPECIES TO MODIFY THE BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER. PERHAPS VARIOUSPSYCHOACTIVE AGENTS APPEARED—AND VANISHED—AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN HISTORY TO PUSHHUMAN BEINGS TO DEVELOP CERTAIN FACULTIES.IF I COULD SUSPEND DISBELIEF, EVEN FOR A MOMENT, OVER THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEREWERE SUCH EXTRADIMENSIONAL BEINGS INVOLVED IN HUMAN AFFAIRS, THEN IT SEEMEDSENSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMELY APPEARANCE OF LSD AS AN INTERPOLATION INTO OURREALM. THE CHEMICAL CATALYST WAS A CONNECTIVE CORD OR SOMETHING LIKE A DIAL-UPCONNECTION TO A HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL ENTITY OF ENORMOUS INTELLIGENCE, SOMEWHATCOLD BUT ESSENTIALLY EMPATHIC, DISPENSING FORESIGHT AND CATALYZING KNOWLEDGE.THE “OTHER” HAD USED HOFMANN AS A MEANS OF GETTING INTO OUR WORLD.AS I LAY ON THE BLANKET WITH EYES CLOSED, LISTENING TO THE SKITTERING BEAT OFTHE TRANCE MUSIC, IGNORING THE CHEERFUL GLOW-STICK-WAVING FREAKS DANCING NEARBY,I HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE TIMING OF THE “DISCOVERY” OF LSD IN NEARLY THE SAMEMOMENT AS THE FINAL SOLUTION, THE HOLOCAUST, AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NUCLEARWEAPONS MIGHT BE FAR FROM COINCIDENTAL. PERHAPS THIS EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTSHAS HAPPENED MANY, MANY TIMES IN THE HISTORY OF THE COSMOS. PERHAPS THERE ARENUMEROUS PLANETS SPRINKLED ACROSS THE UNIVERSE’S STARRY VOIDS WHERE A SENTIENT,TOOL-USING SPECIES RISES UP FROM THE EVOLUTIONARY MUCK TO DISCOVER INSTRUMENTALREASON, MECHANISTIC SCIENCE, THEN SPRINTS STRAIGHT TO THE PERILOUS POINT WHERETHEY UNLEASH THE FORCE OF THE ATOM. PERHAPS, TIME AFTER TIME, THIS INTOXICATIONWITH MECHANICAL RATIONALISM REQUIRES, IN A KIND OF DIALECTICAL PROCESS,TEMPORARY AMNESIA, THE LOSS OF CONNECTION TO ARCHAIC SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE.PRECISELY AT THAT DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT TRANSITIONAL MOMENT, A PROBE IS SENTDOWN FROM THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS. THIS PROBE TAKES THE FORM OF A MOLECULE WITH THEPOWER TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. UNLIKE THE LOCAL PLANTSPIRITS THAT HAVE SPURRED EVOLUTION OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS, THIS NEW CATALYSTHAS TO BE MASS-PRODUCIBLE, SIMPLE TO SYNTHESIZE AND DISTRIBUTE, AND EXTREMELYPOWERFUL. THE MOLECULAR PROBE OR CATALYST ALLOWS THE RECOVERY OF LOST LEVELS OFAWARENESS, REVEALS GAPS AND FLAWS IN THE MECHANISTIC WORLDVIEW, AND FORCES ARECONSIDERATION OF THE NATURE OF REALITY, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN“SUBJECTIVE” AWARENESS AND “OBJECTIVE” WORLD, FROM INSIDE THE DOMAIN OF THENARROW “RATIONALITY.” LSD REVEALS REALITY AS MORE SUPPLE, MORE CAPABLE OF BEINGRESHAPED AND REINVENTED, THAN ANYONE CAN BEGIN TO KNOW.MCKENNA WROTE, “THE SUPPRESSION OF THE NATURAL HUMAN FASCINATION WITH ALTEREDSTATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRESENT PERILOUS SITUATION OF ALL LIFE ON EARTHARE INTIMATELY AND CAUSALLY CONNECTED.” BEYOND ALL OF ITS OTHER MESSAGES, THELSD TRIP SUPPORTS THE CORE TRUTH OF THAT STATEMENT. ALTHOUGH WESTERN SCIENCECONTINUES TO DISMISS AND IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY, THE SUBJECTIVE PERSPECTIVE OFHUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS REMAINS THE ONLY CONCEIVABLE LINK—OR, IF YOU WILL, ESCAPEHATCH—TO OTHER REALMS AND HIGHER DIMENSIONS. LSD AND THE OTHER PSYCHEDELICSSUGGEST, WITH REMARKABLE PERSISTENCE, THAT HUMANITY HAS MORE TO LEARN ABOUT ITSPLACE IN THE COSMOS—DISCOVERIES THAT CAN ONLY BE MADE THROUGH INNER EXPERIENCEAND STUDY OF THE SELF.BUT IF LSD WAS SUCH A TRANSFORMATIVE TOOL, THEN WHY HAD THE SIXTIES ENDED INRUINS? WHY HAD HUMAN BEINGS FAILED TO BE TRANSFORMED IN THEIR ESSENCE?LSD PUSHED THE WEST TO REDISCOVER THE MYSTICAL IMPULSE AND IT HELPED TO LAUNCHMASS MOVEMENTS OF PERSONAL LIBERATION AND ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS, BUT AT THESAME TIME IT INSPIRED THE COVERT CONTROL APPARATUS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIESTO TURN ITS MOST TERRIFYING FANTASIES INTO “MEAT-HOOK REALITIES.” IN OTHERWORDS, LSD CATALYZED AND ACCELERATED BOTH SIDES OF THE LIBERATION/DOMINATIONDIALECTIC. LSD HAS CAUSED CREATIVE BREAKTHROUGHS AND UNLEASHED LATENT PSYCHOSES.IT IS AN AMBIGUOUS TOOL.THERE IS A SECRET HISTORY OF SCIENTISTS EXPLORING PSYCHEDELICS THAT REMAINS TOBE UNCOVERED AND STUDIED. AMONG SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, LSD AND OTHERPSYCHOACTIVE CHEMICALS CONTINUE TO BE USED AS TOOLS TO CATALYZE INSIGHTS. FORINSTANCE, THE GENETICS RESEARCHER KARY MULLIS, WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HISDISCOVERY OF POLYMER CHAIN REACTIONS, USED LSD FOR VISUALIZATIONS ANDPROBLEM-SOLVING. MULLIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW TO PROCLAIM HIS PSYCHEDELIC USE.MARK PESCE CREDITS HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO WRITING VRML, A VIRTUAL REALITYPROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, TO INSIGHTS HE RECEIVED FROM PSILOCYBIN. MANY OF THECOMPUTER PROGRAMMERS AND TECHNICAL ENGINEERS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THEPERSONAL COMPUTER AND THE INTERNET WERE DEVOUT ACIDHEADS IN THEIR YOUTH, AND THEYOUNGER GENERATION HAS FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS. THAT THE BRAIN TRUST OFSILICON VALLEY DESCENDS ANNUALLY ONTO THE HALLUCINATORY CARNIVAL OF BURNING MANDEMONSTRATES THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN PSYCHEDELIC PERCEPTION ANDCUTTING-EDGE COMPUTER SCIENCE.WATCHING THE DANCERS AT THE TRANCE PARTY, I THOUGHT OF AN IDEA OF HENRI BERGSON,A PHILOSOPHER OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE. BERGSON SUGGESTED THE UNIVERSE “WAS AMACHINE TO CREATE GODS.” THE MECHANISTIC METAPHOR WAS JARRING, BUT THEUNDERLYING IDEA—THAT DESPITE SURFACE APPEARANCES, HUMANITY, AS A MASS, ISACCELERATING TOWARD SOME PARTICULAR END—SEEMS PLAUSIBLE, ALTHOUGHONE-DIMENSIONAL. BY REVEALING THE GAPS IN THE MATERIALIST WORLDVIEW ANDUNDERMINING EVERY CERTAINTY WITH SECRET LAUGHTER, LSD MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEARTHAT OUR CURRENT CIVILIZATION IS NOT “THE END OF HISTORY,” NOT THE FINAL FORMOUR EVOLUTION WILL TAKE.PSYCHEDELICS REVEALED TO TERENCE MCKENNA “A CURIOUS LITERARY QUALITY RUNNINGACROSS THE SURFACE OF EXISTENCE.” A POEM, TO A FORMALIST CRITIC, IS “A MACHINEMADE OUT OF WORDS,” DESIGNED TO CREATE A CERTAIN EFFECT. ACCORDING TO MCKENNA,THE SHAMANIC PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE WORLD, ULTIMATELY, IS MADE OUT OF LANGUAGE,WOVEN FROM MYTH—IN OTHER WORDS, AN OBJECTIFIED EXPRESSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.THE NOTION THAT THE WORLD OF MATTER IS ACTUALLY A DENSIFIED FORM OFCONSCIOUSNESS IS INTRINSIC TO BUDDHISM. FOR BUDDHISTS, PHYSICAL REALITY IS ONLYRELATIVELY REAL, AND MATTER ULTIMATELY HAS AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE INTRINSICREALITY AS THE OBJECTS WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN A LUCID DREAM. AS LAMA ANAGARIKAGOVINDA WRITES IN FOUNDATIONS OF TIBETAN MYSTICISM, THE BODY IS “THE COAGULATED,CRYSTALLIZED, OR MATERIALIZED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PAST.” IT IS THEMANIFESTATION OF ACCRUED KARMA, CONSTRUCTED BY SUBTLE LEVELS OF THE MIND. WHILETRIPPING, I COULD EASILY PERCEIVE MY OWN LIFE—AND EVERYBODY ELSE’S—AS A KIND OFCOSMIC FABLE, A GNOSTIC COMIC BOOK, OR A PASSION PLAY THAT WE WERE ALL WRITING.MORE AND MORE, I SUSPECT THAT BUDDHISTS AND SHAMANS ARE CORRECT. WE LIVE IN AWORLD MADE OUT OF LANGUAGE, WOVEN FROM CONSCIOUSNESS, WHETHER WE EVER ALLOWOURSELVES TO KNOW IT OR NOT."},{"pageContent":"[images/00012.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28WHITE BLOSSOMS[images/00006.jpg] ONE NIGHT, SITTING OUTSIDE A BUNGALOW OF THE SERENE CHAN KAHHOTEL IN PALENQUE, MEXICO, I MET DOUGLAS, A TRAVELER FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA. TALLAND LONG-LIMBED, DOUGLAS HAD BLACK DREADLOCKS, WIDE HEAVY-LIDDED EYES, AND ANAPPEALINGLY ATTENUATED GOAT FACE. HE WAS NOT ENROLLED IN THE SYMPOSIUM I WASATTENDING, THE LAST ANNUAL VISIONARY ENTHEOBOTANY CONFERENCE AFTER ATHIRTEEN-YEAR RUN. “ENTHEOBOTANY” IS AN ECCENTRIC COINAGE, MERGING ETHNOBOTANYWITH “ENTHEO” TO CREATE A NEW DISCIPLINE: THE STUDY OF GOD-RELEASING PLANTS.THIS WEEKLONG GATHERING USED TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE FOR CUTTING-EDGE KNOWLEDGE OFOBSCURE INTOXICANTS, ART HISTORICAL CLUES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES, AND PLANTRECIPES, BUT THE INTERNET HAS ABSORBED SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS. IT WAS ATTENDEDBY A WELL-HEELED AUDIENCE OF ENTHUSIASTIC PSYCHONAUTS. DOUGLAS WAS VISITING FROMPAN-CHAN, A POPULAR LOW-BUDGET HANG-OUT ALONG THE ROAD TO THE NEARBY MAYANRUINS. WITH TWO RESTAURANTS, THREE CAMPGROUNDS, HOSTELS, AND BUNGALOWS, AS WELLAS NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT OF FIRE DANCERS AND DIDGERIDOOS, PAN-CHAN IS A HIPPIEINSTITUTION, WHERE COLLEGE KIDS AND BROKE WANDERERS RENT SMALL HUTS OR SLEEP INCOLLECTIVE CIRCLES UNDER HUGE TENTS. THE CHAN KAH HOTEL IS A PALACE OF LUXURY BYCOMPARISON.DOUGLAS TOLD ME HOW, WHEN HE WAS TWENTY, HE HAD HITCHHIKED DOWN TO FLORIDA WITHHIS GIRLFRIEND. SHE LEFT HIM IN KEY WEST, WHERE HE RAN OUT OF MONEY. FOR SEVERALMONTHS HE LIVED IN A PARK WITH OTHER HOMELESS KIDS, PANHANDLING TO SURVIVE. ONENIGHT, A FRIEND OF HIS SAID, “DUDE, WE DON’T HAVE ANY CASH, BUT I HEARD ABOUTTHIS FLOWER YOU CAN EAT THAT GETS YOU REALLY HIGH.” THEY WENT OUT ON A SEARCH.THEY FOUND A TREE GROWING THE FLOWERS HIS FRIEND HAD HEARD ABOUT. THE WHITEBLOSSOMS WERE LONG, PENDULOUS, TRUMPET-SHAPED. THEY PICKED THE FLOWERS AND ATETHREE OF THEM EACH.THE TREE WAS DATURA. DATURA, ALSO KNOWN AS JIMSON WEED, HAS BEEN USED SINCE TIMEIMMEMORIAL BY INDIANS IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA IN INITIATION RITUALS AND OTHERCEREMONIES. IN NORTH AMERICA, IT WAS SACRED TO THE NAVAJO, ZUNI, AND ALGONQUIN,AMONG MANY OTHER TRIBES. IN SOME PLACES, ADOLESCENTS WOULD TAKE A SINGLE MASSIVEDOSE AND “UNLIVE THEIR FORMER LIVES.” AT THE END OF THE TWO-WEEK TRIP, THEINITIATE WOULD DESCRIBE HIS VISIONS TO THE SHAMAN. BASED ON THOSE VISIONS, THESHAMAN WOULD DECIDE WHAT ROLE THE INITIATE WOULD PLAY IN THE TRIBE, AS WELL ASTHE FUTURE COURSE OF HIS LIFE.DATURA IS EQUALLY RENOWNED IN ASIA. “WHEN BUDDHA WAS PREACHING, HEAVEN SPRINKLEDTHE PLANT WITH DEW OR RAINDROPS,” ACCORDING TO PLANTS OF THE GODS. “A TAOISTLEGEND MAINTAINED THAT DATURA METEL IS ONE OF THE CIRCUMPOLAR STARS AND THATENVOYS TO EARTH FROM THAT STAR CARRY A FLOWER OF THE PLANT IN THEIR HAND.”IN INDIA, THE SEEDS ARE SMOKED BY YELLOW-ROBED ASCETICS AND FOLLOWERS OFSHIVA—THE FLOWER CAN BE FOUND IN MANY STATUES OF SHIVA, BLOSSOMING IN HIS LONGHAIR. DATURA CONTAINS THE SAME ALKALOIDS AS SOLANACEOUS PLANTS SUCH ASBELLADONNA, HENBANE, AND MANDRAKE, THE KEY INGREDIENTS IN THE “FLYING POTIONS”OF EUROPEAN WITCHCRAFT. DATURA PRODUCES SCOPOLAMINE AND OTHER TOXINS THAT ACTDIRECTLY ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. I HAVE READ MANY ACCOUNTS OF DATURATRIPS, AND THEY ARE REMARKABLY CONSISTENT. THE EFFECT IS LONG-LASTING ANDTERRIFYING. IT IS PART OF THE PECULIAR LOGIC OF THE WAR ON DRUGS IN AMERICA THATDATURA, WHICH IS DANGEROUS AND DISSOCIATIVE AND CAN IN FACT KILL YOU, IS LEGALTO OWN AND TO USE, WHILE MARIJUANA, ONE OF THE LEAST HARMFUL OF INTOXICANTS,REMAINS ILLEGAL AND DEMONIZED. UNLIKE AYAHUASCA OR MUSHROOMS OR LSD, DATURA ISTHE REAL HORROR-FILM HALLUCINOGEN—THOSE WHO INGEST THE PLANT FIND THEMSELVES INUNREAL WORLDS OF PSYCHOSIS THAT SEEM TOTALLY CONVINCING. THE SPIRIT OF THE PLANTOFTEN APPEARS AS A CACKLING WITCH OR BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. DREAMS OF FLYING, OFTRANSFORMATION INTO ANIMALS AND SATANIC ORGIES ARE COMMON. UNPREPARED TRIPPERSOFTEN END THEIR JOURNEYS IN STRAITJACKETS.“FOR THREE DAYS,” DOUGLAS SAID, “I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME. IREMEMBER, AT ONE POINT, I WAS CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN, GOING UP ROCK BY ROCK, HANDOVER HAND. THEN I CAME BACK TO MYSELF, AND I WAS ACTUALLY CRAWLING ALONG THESIDEWALK ON MY HANDS AND KNEES.” CONTINUALLY DRY-MOUTHED AND DISSOCIATIVE, HEHAD LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS, FAMILY MEMBERS, AND STRANGERS, BUT LATER HEFOUND OUT THAT NONE OF THOSE TALKS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. “LUCKILY, THIS GUY I KNEWFOUND US. HE KNEW ABOUT JIMSON WEED AND HE FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. HEBROUGHT US TO HIS HOUSE AND TOOK CARE OF US UNTIL THE EFFECTS WORE OFF.” AFTERSEVENTY-TWO HOURS, DOUGLAS RECOVERED HIS SENSES. A FEW MONTHS LATER, HE RETURNEDHOME TO CANADA. “ONE THING THAT WAS WEIRD AFTER THAT,” HE SAID, “ALTHOUGH INEVER TRIED DATURA AGAIN, I KEPT WANTING TO DO IT, THINKING OF IT, AND SEVERALTIMES I TRIED TO CONVINCE FRIENDS TO TAKE IT WITH ME, TELLING THEM HOW COOL ITWAS.”SEVEN YEARS PASSED BEFORE DOUGLAS WENT DOWN TO MEXICO TO VISIT ANOTHER FRIEND.HIS FRIEND WAS LIVING WITH THE HUICHOLS, THE TRIBE MADE FAMOUS IN THE 1960S BYBARBARA MEYERHOFF’S BOOK PEYOTE HUNT. THE HUICHOL GO ON A LONG SACRED PILGRIMAGEEVERY YEAR, TRAVELING TO A DISTANT DESERT AND STORING UP SUPPLIES OF PEYOTE. HISFRIEND WAS LEARNING THE HUICHOL LANGUAGE, STUDYING THEIR TRADITIONS IN EXCHANGEFOR HIS LABOR. HE BROUGHT DOUGLAS TO MEET THE TRIBE’S SHAMAN, A SMALL, WRINKLEDMAN IN HIS SEVENTIES. THE SHAMAN LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT, THEN TURNED TO HISFRIEND AND SAID ONE WORD IN THE HUICHOL LANGUAGE, WHICH HIS FRIEND THENTRANSLATED: “DATURA.”DOUGLAS WAS STUNNED. EMBARRASSED BY MEMORIES OF BEING DISSOCIATIVE ANDOUT-OF-CONTROL AND GENERALLY UNCOOL, HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED THE HELLISH TRIP TOHIS FRIENDS. THE SHAMAN IMMEDIATELY SAW THAT HE HAD ENCOUNTERED DATURA, THAT HEHAD BEEN DAMAGED BY THE MALICIOUS PLANT-SPIRIT. DATURA HAD WOUNDED HIS PSYCHEAND THIS WOUND HAD NEVER BEEN REPAIRED. THE SHAMAN OFFERED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.DURING A CEREMONY, THE OLD MAN CHANTED OVER HIS BODY, SUCKED AT HIS SKIN ANDSPAT OUT—THE BRUSQUE TECHNIQUES OF TRADITIONAL SHAMANIC HEALING. FOR HOURS,UNTIL HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE HEALING HAD TAKEN EFFECT, THE OLD SHAMAN SANG,SPRITZED TOBACCO JUICE AND MESCAL OVER HIS BARE TORSO, DISPELLING THE EVILPRESENCE. “I DIDN’T FEEL DIFFERENT RIGHT AWAY, BUT OVER TIME, MY LIFE SEEMED TOGO BETTER THAN BEFORE,” HE SAID. “I DON’T KNOW IF IT WAS THAT CEREMONY OR NOTTHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE.”I HEARD MANY STORIES LIKE THAT ONE DURING MY WEEK IN PALENQUE, STORIES OF PLANTSWITH SPECIFIC POWERS, OF SHAMANS ABLE TO COMMUNE WITH THEM AND PERFORM HEALINGS.THE VISIONARY ENTHEOBOTANY CONFERENCE FEATURED SEVERAL LECTURES EACH DAY. THELECTURERS WERE A CURIOUS MIXTURE OF CHEMISTS, PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCHERS, HIPSTERANTHROPOLOGISTS, ETHNOBOTANISTS, AND ART HISTORIANS. AFTER THE 1960S, WHENPSYCHEDELICS BECAME SO INTERESTING TO SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE QUICKLYOUTLAWED AND SUPPRESSED, THE STUDY OF MIND-ALTERING PLANTS WAS RELEGATED TO THECULTURAL MARGINS. I DIDN’T KNOW IT WHEN I FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN THESUBJECT, BUT OUTSIDE OF THE MAINSTREAM THE AREA WAS NEVER ABANDONED. A GROUP OFBRILLIANT RESEARCHERS AND SEEKERS, INDEPENDENT MAVERICKS, HAVE PURSUED THESUBJECT WITH SINGLE-MINDED PASSION AND DILIGENCE. MANY OF THEM SELF-PUBLISHEDTHEIR FINDINGS IN REMARKABLE TOMES. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOME OF THEM."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29THE QUALITYOF REVEALING[images/00006.jpg] A PH.D. CHEMIST IN HIS SIXTIES WHO STARTED HIS CAREERWORKING FOR DOW, SASHA SHULGIN HAS DEDICATED HIMSELF TO DISCOVERING ANDANALYZING NEW MIND-ALTERING COMPOUNDS. IN PERSON, HE IS A LARGE MAN, WEARINGUNTUCKED HAWAIIAN SHIRTS AND PROJECTING A WARM, SANTA CLAUS VIBE.“I WENT TO HARVARD, DIDN’T FIT IN THERE, SO I WENT INTO THE NAVY,” HE RECALLEDAT PALENQUE. “IN THE NAVY, I FIRST THOUGHT ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEENPSYCHOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY WHEN I WAS GIVEN MORPHINE AFTER AN ACCIDENT. THE PAINWAS STILL THERE BUT IT DIDN’T BOTHER ME ANYMORE. I FOUND THAT FASCINATING: HOWCOULD I HAVE PAIN AND IT NOT HURT?” HE FIRST TRIED MESCALINE—“GORGEOUS CRYSTALS,LONG, NEEDLE-SHAPED”—IN 1960. HE DESCRIBED THE EXPERIENCE IN HIS BOOK PIKHAL:“MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, THE WORLD AMAZED ME, IN THAT I SAW IT AS I HAD WHEN IWAS A CHILD. I HAD FORGOTTEN THE BEAUTY AND THE MAGIC AND THE KNOWINGNESS OF ITAND ME.” WHAT REMAINED WITH HIM, ABOVE ALL, WAS THE REALIZATION THAT “THISAWESOME RECALL HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY A FRACTION OF A GRAM OF A WHITE SOLID.”THE COLORS OF THE WORLD, THE RECLAIMING OF CHILDHOOD SENSATIONS, WAS NOT INSIDETHE POWDER. THE CHEMICAL ONLY REVEALED WHAT WAS INSIDE OF HIM.“I UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS CONTAINED IN THE MIND AND THE SPIRIT.WE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO FIND ACCESS TO IT, WE MAY EVEN DENY ITS EXISTENCE, BUT ITIS INDEED THERE INSIDE US, AND THERE ARE CHEMICALS THAT CAN CATALYZE ITSAVAILABILITY.” HE SYNTHESIZED A MESCALINELIKE CHEMICAL, CHANGING THE POSITION OFONE ATOM. “THIS TIME I TORE UP THE FLOWER INSTEAD OF STARING AT IT.” HE WASAMAZED THAT SUCH A SMALL CHANGE IN A COMPOUND COULD REVEAL SUCH UTTERLYDIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HIS OWN MIND. FASCINATED, HE BEGAN TO SYNTHESIZE “A WHOLECASCADE OF WHITE SOLIDS”—HE HAD FOUND HIS FIELD OF RESEARCH.IF THE COUNTERCULTURE ACCORDED AN EQUIVALENT TO THE NOBEL PRIZE, SHULGIN WOULDBE A SHOE-IN FOR THE HONOR. HE PULLED MDMA, ECSTASY, OUT OF THE DUSTBIN OFIGNORED OLD CHEMICALS—IT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY A GERMAN COMPANY IN THE 1920S,THEN FORGOTTEN. SHULGIN RESYNTHESIZED MDMA IN THE LATE 1960S, NOTED ITS FIZZY,EMPATHIC PROPERTIES—“IT WAS NOT A PSYCHEDELIC IN THE VISUAL OR INTERPRETIVESENSE, BUT THE LIGHTNESS AND WARMTH OF THE PSYCHEDELIC WAS PRESENT AND QUITEREMARKABLE. . . . I DEVELOPED A GREAT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR THEMATERIAL”—AND LAUNCHED IT ON THE THIRTY-YEAR TRAJECTORY THAT WOULD LEAD TO THESMILEY-FACED RAVE CULTURE WE KNOW TODAY, AS WELL AS AN EFFECTIVE, OFTENOBSCURED, TRADITION OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC USE. BUT THAT WAS JUST ONE OF SHULGIN’SACCOMPLISHMENTS. HE MADE THE LONG-LASTING PSYCHEDELIC DOM, LATER GIVEN THESTREET NAME STP (“SERENITY, TRANQUILLITY, AND PEACE,” OR, SHULGIN RECALLS, “TOOSTUPID TO PUKE”). AS OFTEN HAPPENED WITH SHULGIN, HE FOUND THE CHEMICAL,SELF-TESTED AND ANALYZED ITS EFFECTS, PUBLISHED A PAPER ABOUT IT, THEN FOUNDLATER THAT DEALERS HAD RIPPED OFF HIS FORMULA AND DISTRIBUTED IT TO THE STREETIN EXCESSIVE DOSAGES. STP IS A HEAVY-DUTY MIND WARPER—SHULGIN’S UNFORTUNATECONTRIBUTION TO THE CHAOS OF THE LATE 1960S. IT LASTS A LONG TIME (TEN TOSIXTEEN HOURS), AND ITS EFFECTS TAKE HOURS TO COME ON—KIDS WOULD TAKE A PILL,WAIT A WHILE AND THINK THAT NOTHING WAS HAPPENING, THEN TAKE ANOTHER PILL. WHENTHE DOUBLE DOSE KICKED IN, DISORIENTED TRIPPERS WOULD END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS.SHULGIN DISCOVERED WHAT WAS HAPPENING QUICKLY. IRONICALLY, AT THE SAME TIME HEWAS INVENTING NEW CHEMICALS, HE WAS ALSO EMPLOYED BY THE DEA TO ANALYZE NEWDRUGS TURNED UP BY THE POLICE.WITH HIS WIFE, ANN, SHULGIN HAS SELF-PUBLISHED TWO BOOKS, PIHKAL(“PHENETHYLAMINES I HAVE KNOWN AND LOVED”) AND TIHKAL (“TRYPTAMINES I HAVE KNOWNAND LOVED”), THAT ARE THICK COMPENDIUMS OF HIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OFHUNDREDS OF NEW PSYCHOACTIVE CHEMICALS. HE PUBLISHED HIS FINDINGS BECAUSE OF THEEXAMPLE OF WILHELM REICH, THE ONCE-ESTEEMED GERMAN PSYCHOANALYST, PROMOTER OFSEXUAL LIBERATION AND THE ORGASM, WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES TO ESCAPE NAZIPERSECUTION. THE STORY OF REICH’S LATER LIFE IS TRAGIC AND CAUTIONARY:CONTINUING HIS RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES, HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD UNCOVEREDA REGENERATIVE BIOLOGICAL FORCE, WHICH HE CALLED ORGONE ENERGY. IN THE 1950S,REICH, CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN CRACKPOT ENTHUSIASM, MARKETED ORGONEBOXES, WHICH LOOKED A BIT LIKE TELEPHONE BOOTHS, AS A WAY OF CONCENTRATING THISLIFE-GIVING FORCE. HE BELIEVED HIS BOXES PROVIDED PROTECTION AGAINST CANCER ANDOTHER HEALTH RISKS. THE FDA IMPRISONED REICH FOR MAKING UNPROVEN HEALTH CLAIMSFOR HIS BOXES, AND HE DIED, BROKENHEARTED, IN PRISON. AFTER HIS DEATH, THE U.S.GOVERNMENT, IN THE GRIP OF CULTURAL MCCARTHYISM, SEIZED REICH’S ARCHIVES OFUNPUBLISHED PAPERS AND DESTROYED THEM. SHULGIN REALIZED SUCH A FATE WAS POSSIBLEFOR ANY SCIENTIST WORKING FAR OUTSIDE OF THE MAINSTREAM, ESPECIALLY IN HISMUCH-DEMONIZED ARENA, AND HE DECIDED TO DISTRIBUTE HIS KNOWLEDGE AS A FORM OFSELF-PROTECTION.SHULGIN’S CHEMICAL ENGINEERING IS MUCH MORE EXACT THAN THE FROTHY PSEUDOSCIENCEBEHIND REICH’S ORGONE. IN THE BOOKS, SHULGIN SPLIT HIS RESEARCH INTO TWO CLASSESOF CHEMICALS, EACH RELATED TO ONE OF THE BRAIN’S MAJOR NEUROTRANSMITTERS:SEROTONIN, WHICH IS A TRYPTAMINE, AND DOPAMINE, A PHENETHYLAMINE. TRYPTAMINESFOUND IN NATURE INCLUDE DMT, LSD, PSILOCYBIN, AND BUFOTENIN. WELL-KNOWNPHENETHYLAMINES INCLUDE MESCALINE, MDMA, AND MDA—THE SIMPLE MOLECULE,PHENETHYLAMINE ITSELF, IS A MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF CHOCOLATE.“A MOLECULE IS LIKE A DANGLING HEXAGON,” SHULGIN SAID. “I ASK MYSELF: HOW MANYTHINGS CAN I ATTACH TO IT. IT IS LIKE PUTTING DECORATIONS ON A CHRISTMAS TREE.YOU CAN DO THINGS IN SIX DIFFERENT WAYS. I TRY TO TEST OUT ALL OF THE OPTIONS.WHEN YOU FIND A LITTLE SOMETHING AT ONE LEVEL, YOU DON’T DOUBLE THE AMOUNT,DON’T LEAP INTO A NEW LEVEL. EARLY ON IN MY RESEARCH, I TRIED TO FIND THE MOSTPOTENT COMPOUNDS. LATER I BACKED AWAY FROM THAT TO SEARCH FOR THE MOSTINTERESTING AND REVEALING. THE POTENCY IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE QUALITY OF THEREVEALING.”I HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAMPLE A FEW OF THE CONCOCTIONS ANALYZED INSHULGIN’S BOOKS. MOST INTRIGUING—SO INTRIGUING, IN FACT, THAT IT IS NOW, ALAS,SCHEDULE ONE—WAS 2CB, A COMPOUND DESCRIBED TO ME, ACCURATELY, AS A“SUPER-SANITY” DRUG. ONE OF THE ONLY CREATIONS TO BE GIVEN A “+++++” INSHULGIN’S VERSION OF A FIVE-STAR RATING SYSTEM, 2CB IS KNOWN TO BE VERYDOSE-SENSITIVE. A TINY INCREASE OF 5 OR 10 MILLIGRAMS IN THE INGESTED AMOUNT CANCAUSE A SPECTACULAR INCREASE OR RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF EFFECT. IN LOW DOSES,AS I TRIED IT, 2CB INCREASES MENTAL AND SENSORY ACUITY. THOUGHTS ZING AROUND THEMIND ON HIGH-TENSION WIRES. LIGHT REVEALS ITSELF AS PRECISION FILAMENTS, ASSPINDLY NETWORKS OF REFRACTIONS. IF 2CB WERE LEGALLY AVAILABLE, IT WOULD BE, ONLOW DOSES, AN INTRIGUING, HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE TOOL FOR INTELLECTUAL LABOR.FOR THOSE EXPLORERS WHO ARE HARD CORE INTO THE PSYCHEDELIC CULTURE—DEEPER INTOIT THAN I CARE TO GO—THERE IS A TREND CALLED “POLYDRUGGING” IN WHICH MULTIPLECHEMICALS ARE MIXED AND MATCHED. THE PROFESSIONAL PSYCHONAUT JONATHAN OTT CALLSTHIS PROCESS THE “BIOASSAY.” HE SEES IT AS SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTING. IN THISTERRA INCOGNITA, ABANDONED BY THE ACADEMIES, THE ONLY POSSIBLE TERRITORY FOR THEEXPERIMENT IS YOUR OWN BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH I AM, COMPARED TOSOME, A PSYCHONAUTICAL CHICKEN, I DID TRY ONE SUCH CHEMICAL COCKTAIL—AMARTINI-MIX OF MDMA WITH A VERMOUTH-SIZED WHISPER OF 2CB. I WILL NOT TELL A LIE.THAT COMBINATION WAS A MAGIC MELD OF WARMTH, EUPHORIA, AND CLEAR LIGHT. IT ISCONSCIOUSNESS AS AN AIR ELEMENTAL OR SYLPH MUST ENJOY IT. I HASTEN TO ADD,DESPITE THE RUSH OF THAT LUCID, LIMPID STATE, I FELT NO COMPULSION TO REPEAT THETRIP. THERE WAS NO ADDICTIVE PULL TOWARD IT; IT WAS, AS HUXLEY DESCRIBEDMESCALINE, A “GRATUITOUS GRACE,” WITH A FAINT CHEMICAL BITE. WHILE WALKINGAROUND A MIST-SHROUDED FOREST ON THAT POTION, I SUDDENLY REALIZED EXACTLY WHOSHULGIN IS: WITH HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS, INCLUDING A FEW STRAYING STRANDS OFPRODIGIOUS LENGTH, AND WHITE CURLY BEARD, HE IS THE CONTEMPORARY REINCARNATIONOF MERLIN, ORIGINAL DRUID AND ARCHAIC ALCHEMICAL GENIUS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.SHULGIN IS AN ALCHEMIST ENGAGED IN THE AGELESS QUEST FOR THECONSCIOUSNESS-EXPANDING ELIXIR OR PHILOSOPHERS’ STONE.PIHKAL AND TIHKAL ARE TEXTS DEVOTED TO SHULGIN’S SINGULAR INTELLECTUALENTERPRISE, AND NOT JUST REFERENCES BUT ALSO MEMOIRS, PHILOSOPHICAL TREATISES,ESSAYS ON THE SUSPECT POLITICS OF THE DRUG WAR, MEDITATIONS ON THE NATURE OFCONSCIOUSNESS, CHEMISTRY LESSONS, AND RECIPE BOOKS. DESPITE FDA SCRUTINY ANDGOVERNMENT RAIDS ON HIS LABORATORY, SHULGIN HAS NEVER BEEN ARRESTED AND ISUNWAVERING IN HIS BELIEF IN THE INHERENT IMPORTANCE OF DRUGS AS TOOLS FORSELF-EXPLORATION. IN THE INTRODUCTION TO TIKHAL HE DESCRIBES THE ENTRY OFPSYCHEDELICS INTO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WEST AS A PARALLEL PROCESS RUNNINGBESIDE THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES OF DESTRUCTION—AN EROS TO THETECHNOBUREAUCRACTIC THANATOS. SHULGIN STATES THAT RADIATION WAS DISCOVERED IN1897, ONE YEAR BEFORE ARTHUR HEFFTER TRIED MESCALINE IN LEIPZIG.“SINCE ALMOST ALL DISCOVERIES ABOUT THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE USED FOR BOTHBENIGN AND LETHAL PURPOSES, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE BEGIN TO DEVELOP A WAY OFEXPLORING AND UNDERSTANDING THOSE FORCES WITHIN OUR UNCONSCIOUS SELVES WHICHWILL INEVITABLY MAKE THOSE DECISIONS,” HE WRITES. WHILE CAUTIONING EXPLORERS TOSEEK VETERAN GUIDES AND BE AWARE OF THE DANGERS, SHULGIN NOTES THAT PSYCHOACTIVECOMPOUNDS ARE THE SWIFTEST MEANS TO SELF-EXPLORATION, AND WITH THEEVER-INCREASING DANGERS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS THE RAPID GROWTH OFAUTHORITARIAN CONTROLS, OUR OWN AWARENESS MUST TAKE QUANTUM LEAPS TO KEEP PACE.“THESE TOOLS—THE PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS AND PLANTS—OFFER A MUCH FASTER METHOD THANMOST OF THE CLASSICAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE GOALS WE SEEK:CONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF OUR INTERIOR WORKINGS AND GREATER CLARITY AS TO OURRESPONSIBILITIES TOWARDS OUR OWN SPECIES AND ALL OTHERS WITH WHOM WE SHARE THISPLANET.”IN THE BOOKS, HE DIAGRAMS EACH MOLECULE, DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF SYNTHESIZINGIT, THEN RECOUNTS HIS OWN SELF-TESTING, BEGINNING WITH A LOW DOSE AND SLOWLYMOVING UP. IF THE COMPOUNDS REACHED A CERTAIN POINT OF EVIDENT INTEREST, SHULGINWOULD SHARE THEM WITH HIS WIFE AND A CLOSE CIRCLE OF PSYCHONAUTICALFRIENDS—WEEKEND EXPERIMENTS, CONTINUED OVER YEARS, THAT HAVE BECOME THE STUFF OFUNDERGROUND LEGEND. ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF THESE ANONYMOUS REPORTS GOES ASFOLLOWS: “ABOUT 10 SECONDS OR SO AFTER INHALING THE LAST OF THE SMOKE, IT BEGANWITH A FAST-RISING SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AND WONDER, WITH AN UNDERTONE OF ‘NOWYOU’VE DONE IT,’ BUT DOMINATED BY A SENSE OF ‘WOW, THIS IS IT.’ ”HE HAS FOUND DRUGS THAT AFFECT ONLY ONE OF THE SENSES, SUCH AS DIPT, WHICHCAUSES CHANGES IN HEARING, A COLLAPSE OF ANY SENSE OF PITCH. HE HAS DONEFASCINATING EXPERIMENTS WITH CYCLOTRON MACHINES THAT SHOWED THE SURPRISING PATHOF CERTAIN MIND-ALTERING COMPOUNDS THROUGH THE BODY—FOR INSTANCE, THELONG-LASTING COMPOUND DOB AFFECTS THE MIND ALTHOUGH IT IS ABSORBED BY THE LUNGS.“WE SAW DOB GO DIRECTLY INTO THE LUNG, NOT INTO THE BRAIN. THERE ARE NEURONS INTHE LUNG, AND THEN, WHILE IT WAS THERE, DOB METABOLIZED INTO SOMETHING ELSE.”SHULGIN HAS INVENTED, OVER THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER, A TOOL KIT FOR EXPLORINGCONSCIOUSNESS—AS WELL AS THE SENSES, THE MIND, AND THE EMOTIONS. DUE TO THEPROHIBITION ON MIND DRUGS, EXCEPT FOR EGO-CONTROLLING SSRIS LIKE PROZAC, THEREIS NO MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD STUDYING THE POSSIBLE USESOF THESE TOOLS IN MORE DETAIL, UNLESS THE CIA HAS REMAINED COVERTLY ON THE CASE.SHULGIN BELIEVES THAT PSYCHEDELICS ARE, FOR THE MIND, WHAT THE TELESCOPE WAS FORASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH, OR THE MICROSCOPE FOR BIOLOGY. THEY ARE INSTRUMENTS THATCREATE THE GROUNDS FOR NEW DISCOVERIES. HE EQUATES THE CONTINUED ANIMOSITYTOWARD EXPLORATION OF THE MIND THROUGH CHEMICALS TO THE CHURCH’S REACTION TOGALILEO’S THEORY THAT THE EARTH WAS NOT AT THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THREEHUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO, SHULGIN NOTES, THE CHURCH PROCLAIMED, “THE EARTH ISTHE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE, AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A HERETIC.” TODAY,THE GOVERNMENT PROCLAIMS, “ALL DRUGS THAT CAN EXPAND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE WITHOUTMEDICAL OR SOCIAL JUSTIFICATION, AND ANYONE WHO USES THEM IS A CRIMINAL.” INGALILEO’S TIME, THE AUTHORITIES SAID, “WE DO NOT NEED TO ACTUALLY LOOK THROUGHTHAT MYSTERIOUS CONTRAPTION.” NOW THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, “THERE IS NO NEED TOACTUALLY TASTE THOSE MYSTERIOUS COMPOUNDS.” IN THE PAST, THE CHURCH SAID, “HOWDARE YOU CLAIM THAT THE EARTH IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE?” TODAY THEGOVERNMENT SAYS, “HOW DARE YOU CLAIM THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF GOD IS TO BE FOUNDIN A WHITE POWDER?”HE QUOTES VOLTAIRE: “IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE RIGHT IN MATTERS ON WHICH THEESTABLISHED AUTHORITIES ARE WRONG.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30THE FAIRY FOLK[images/00006.jpg] THE ATTENDEES AT THE CONFERENCE WERE A MIXTURE OF HEDONISTSAND SCIENTISTS, PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS AND ENGLISH ARISTOCRATS, SUBURBANHOUSEWIVES AND THERAPISTS, PROMOTERS OF UNSCHEDULED DRUGS AND WITCHES,ADVERTISING COPYWRITERS AND APPRENTICE SHAMANS. THERE WAS PAUL, A PRECOCIOUSNINETEEN-YEAR-OLD FROM UTAH, LONG-HAIRED, PALE, AND FRAIL, WHO SEEMED TO HAVECOMMITTED TO MEMORY ENTIRE ARCHIVES OF INFORMATION ABOUT PSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUNDS,MINDS, AND MOLECULES. FOR PAUL, THE WORLD WAS A MULTILEVELED COSMIC-GNOSTICCONSPIRACY. HE WARNED ME ABOUT EVIDENCE OF MENTAL DETERIORATION CAUSED BY HIGHLEVELS OF FLUORIDE IN THE U.S. DRINKING WATER, TOLD ME TO READ A SIX-VOLUME SETOF WORKS ON EARLIER CIVILIZATIONS AND UFO CONTACT. WHEN I PASSED HIM IN THEDINING AREA, WHERE HE WAS CONFERRING WITH SHULGIN OR OTHER EXPERTS, PAUL ALWAYSSEEMED TO BE MAKING COMMENTS SUCH AS, “I AM REALLY INTERESTED IN THE STRUCTUREOF THAT BENZENE MOLECULE WHEN YOU ADD THAT PARTICULAR INDOLE RING.”THERE WAS PSYCHO TIM, A BLACK-MUSTACHIO’D MIDDLE-AGED CHEMICAL ENGINEER WORKINGFOR MONSANTO IN HIS REAL LIFE, BUILDING NEW MOOD ALTERERS, WHO BROKE OUTSUBCULTURAL T-SHIRTS OF ALIENS, LIZARDS, AND ’SHROOMS FOR HIS WEEK OF UNBRIDLEDPSYCHOACTIVITY. DARA, A WITCH FROM TENNESSEE, HAD BEEN HIRED AS A GARDENER BYTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH, THEN FIRED FOR HER PAGAN BELIEFS, AND WAS NOW INVOLVED IN ALENGTHY LAWSUIT DEMANDING REINSTATEMENT. DARA HAD A NERVOUS EDGINESS, ARECOGNIZABLY AMBIGUOUS WITCHY TWITCHINESS TO HER. IT WAS NOT SURPRISING TO LEARNTHAT HER ALLY OF CHOICE WAS DATURA. THERE WAS THE LOVELY, BATTY LADY NEIPATH,WEARING COLORFUL DESIGNER OUTFITS, WITH HUSBAND, LORD NEIPATH, IN TOW. LADYNEIPATH HAD ACHIEVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SHUDDERY NOTORIETY FOR HER AVOWEDBELIEF IN TREPHINATION, ONCE COMMON AMONG AZTEC NOBILITY. SIMPLY PUT,TREPHINATION IS THE PRACTICE OF DRILLING A NOT-INCONSIDERABLE HOLE IN THE TOP OFTHE SKULL, THOUGHT TO INCREASE INTELLIGENCE AND MYSTICAL COMMUNICATION BYSPEEDING BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE BRAIN. THE NEIPATHS NOT ONLY PUT UP A WEBSITE ONTHE SUBJECT, THEY BOTH UNDERWENT THE PROCEDURE—LADY NEIPATH HAD, IN FACT,TREPANNED HERSELF IN HER STARRY-EYED, BOHEMIAN YOUTH.THERE WAS TALK AT THE CONFERENCE ABOUT WILLIAM PICKARD, A HARVARD ACADEMIC ANDFRIEND OF LORD AND LADY NEIPATH. RECENTLY BUSTED IN KANSAS, PICKARD WASALLEGEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING AN LSD FACTORY INSIDE AN ABANDONED NUCLEARMISSILE SILO ON PRIVATE LAND, PRODUCING AS MUCH AS TEN MILLION DOSES OF LSD AMONTH (A THIRD OF ALL THE LSD PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES, BY ONE ESTIMATE).THE SILO HAD BEEN OUTFITTED WITH A WHIRLPOOL BATH, ITALIAN MARBLE TILING, AND A£60,000 AUDIO SYSTEM, ACCORDING TO THE TIMES OF LONDON.THERE WAS ONLY ONE DRUG THAT, IF IT COULD BE FOUND AROUND THE SHADOWY MARGINS OFTHE CONFERENCE, I WAS KEEN TO TEST-DRIVE. THAT WAS THE PURIFIED FORM OFSYNTHETIC DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE. THROUGH PLANTS SUCH AS PSYCHOTRIA VIRIDIS, DMT ISA COMPONENT IN AYAHUASCA POTIONS. IT IS ALSO PRESENT IN THE PSYCHOACTIVE SNUFFSUSED BY TRIBES SUCH AS THE YANOMAMO OF BRAZIL—FAMOUS FILMS OF THE YANOMAMO SHOWTHE TRIBESMEN, NAKED EXCEPT FOR A PENIS SHEATH, BLOWING POWDER THROUGH LONGTUBES UP EACH OTHER’S NOSTRILS, THEN SHAKING THEIR HEADS, WILDLY ENTRANCED, ASTHICK RIVULETS OF GREEN SNOT POUR OUT. FROM ALL I HAD READ, THE SMOKABLE ORINJECTED FORM OF SYNTHETIC DMT—NO SNOT INVOLVED—SEEMED TO BE MODERN SCIENCE’SGREATEST CONTRIBUTION TO ARCHAIC AMAZONIAN SPIRITUALITY: IT WAS SUPPOSED TOPROVIDE AN INSTANT BREAKTHROUGH INTO OUT-OF-BODY VISIONARY EXPERIENCE—YOU GO UPLIKE A ROCKET AND SPLASH DOWN IN UNDER TEN MINUTES. OVER THE LAST DECADES,SMOKED SYNTHETIC DMT WAS POPULARIZED AS THE EGO-CRUSHER-OF-CHOICE BY THE LATETERENCE MCKENNA.MCKENNA FLUENTLY DESCRIBED HIS DMT FLASHES AS “BURSTING INTO A SPACE INHABITEDBY MERRY ELFIN, SELF-TRANSFORMING, MACHINE CREATURES. DOZENS OF THESE FRIENDLYFRACTAL ENTITIES, LOOKING LIKE SELF-DRIBBLING FABERGÉ EGGS ON THE REBOUND, HADSURROUNDED ME AND TRIED TO TEACH ME THE LOST LANGUAGE OF TRUE POETRY. THEYSEEMED TO BE BABBLING IN A VISIBLE AND FIVE-DIMENSIONAL FORM OF ECSTATICNOSTRATIC, TO JUDGE FROM THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THIS GNOMISH PRATTLE.MIRROR-SURFACED TUMBLING RIVERS OF MELTED MEANING FLOWED GURGLING AROUND ME.”MCKENNA WAS THE STAR LECTURER AND BIGGEST DRAW OF THE VISIONARY ENTHEOBOTANYCONFERENCE UP UNTIL HIS DEATH, AFTER WHICH THE EVENT SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITSIMPETUS AND ITS FORCE, AND ATTENDANCE DROPPED BY MORE THAN HALF.THROUGHOUT CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, WHEREVER A SOURCE OF A TRYPTAMINE WASFOUND, AN INDIAN TRIBE HAD SETTLED, OVER CENTURIES DEVELOPING THEIR OWNLANGUAGE, COSMOLOGY, AND SHAMANIC SYSTEM. SUBMERSION IN THE DMT STATE WAS THEULTIMATE SPIRITUAL GOAL. EVEN THOUGH IT CAN BE CHEMICALLY SYNTHESIZED FROMNUMEROUS BOTANICAL SOURCES—COMMONLY AVAILABLE PLANTS SUCH AS PHALARIS GRASS,ACACIA, AND MIMOSA HOSTILIS—THERE IS SOMETHING ODDLY INACCESSIBLE ABOUT PUREDMT. UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN, IT SEEMS THAT SMOKABLE DMT, THE PHYSICAL STUFF ASWELL AS THE BIZARRE REALMS IT REVEALS, HAS A LEPRECHAUNLIKE QUALITY. SOMETIMESDMT TURNS UP WHEN YOU ARE NOT READY FOR IT—“INSTANT OTHER WORLD ACCESS? OFCOURSE I APPRECIATE THE OFFER BUT YOU SEE I HAVE THIS DENTIST APPOINTMENTTOMORROW”—AND THEN, WHEN YOU ARE FINALLY PREPARED TO BLAST OFF, IT WILL VANISH.IN MY SEARCH FOR THE STUFF I KEPT MEETING PEOPLE WHO HAD IT, OR PROUDLYANNOUNCED THAT THEY DID, BUT THEN WOULD BEGIN TO MUMBLE OR LOOK AWAY WHEN IACTUALLY ASKED FOR A TINY LUMP FROM THEIR STASH. NOT MUCH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH; ALIFETIME SUPPLY WOULD BE SMALLER THAN A BAR OF HOTEL SOAP. I KNOW OF OTHERDMT-SEEKERS WHO WAITED, PLOTTED, FINALLY FOUND IT—AS WELL AS THE PROPER SET ANDSETTING, THE REQUISITE GLASS PIPE AND BUTANE LIGHTER, THE SHAMANIC HELPER ANDPROPER ASTROLOGICAL ALIGNMENT—AND THEN FOUND THEMSELVES COUGHING UP THE PRECIOUSVAPOR BEFORE THEY COULD INGEST ENOUGH OF IT TO BLAST OFF. AS MARK PESCE TOLD MEAT BURNING MAN, “I’VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HOLD THE SMOKE LONG ENOUGH TO GETTHROUGH THE GLASS CHRYSANTHEMUM.”AS DMT DID NOT INSTANTLY MATERIALIZE, I WENT WITH ANOTHER CONFEREE, A BAY AREALAWYER WORKING AT A THINK TANK ON EDUCATIONAL POLICY, ON A HUNT FOR MUSHROOMS,THE LOCAL SPECIALTY. ATTEMPTS TO BUY DRUGS ARE ALWAYS EXERCISES IN HUMILIATION.IN THIS CASE, WE HAD TO ASK LOCALS, OLD WIZENED LADIES SELLING CANDY ON THEROAD, FOR DIRECTIONS TO LAS HONGAS. THEY POINTED TO A DIRT TRAIL AND WE MARCHEDALONG IT CLUELESSLY UNTIL A YOUNG BOY RODE OUT TO US ON A DONKEY. WITH A SOLEMNAND PROFESSIONAL MANNER, HE TOLD US TO WAIT WHILE HE FETCHED PLASTIC BAGS FULLOF BLACK MURK WITH A SLUSH OF MUSHROOMS FLOATING AROUND INSIDE—HIGHLYUNAPPETIZING. SOMEHOW ASHAMED BY THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION, WE FORGOT TO BARGAINHIM DOWN FROM HIS HIGH ASKING PRICE.BEFORE THE MUSHROOMS, EATEN IN A BROTH OF MEXICAN CHOCOLATE, WE TOOK A FIRSTCOURSE OF MOCLOBEMIDE, AN OVER-THE-COUNTER (IN MEXICO, ANYWAY) ANTIDEPRESSANTCONTAINING A MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITOR. AS WITH AYAHUASCA COMBINATIONS, THEEFFECT OF THIS MAO-I WAS TO POTENTIATE THE TRYPTAMINES IN THE MUSHROOM. I HADNEVER TRIED SUCH A COMBINATION BEFORE, AND ITS FIZZY CHEMICAL AMBIENCE DISTURBEDME.A FEW YEARS EARLIER, WHEN I REVIVED MY INTEREST IN PSYCHEDELICS, I FIRST WENTTHROUGH A MERRY MUSHROOM-EATING PHASE. I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE WAY MODERATE DOSESOF MUSHROOMS ADDED LEVELS AND LAYERS TO NORMAL CONSCIOUS LIFE—COLORS AND SOUNDSDEEPENED, THE EFFECT OF A PATTERN OF LIGHT AND SHADOWS COULD BECOME ALMOSTUNBEARABLY BEAUTIFUL, MY OWN EMPATHIC AND EMOTIONAL QUALITIES SEEMEDFINER-TUNED. ON HIGHER DOSES, WITH EYES CLOSED, I SAW THOSE AZTEC-PATTERNEDSCI-FI CIVILIZATIONS FLYING PAST ME AT JET SPEED, AS MCKENNA DESCRIBED, ALTHOUGHI NEVER TOOK THE FIVE-GRAM MEGADOSE THAT, ACCORDING TO MCKENNA, LEADS TO DIRECTCOMMUNICATION WITH A LOQUACIOUS “MUSHROOM MAN.” THE AZTEC FUTURIST IMAGERY STILLSEEMED LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE AN OPTICAL EFFECT, A RAPID FIRING OFNEURONAL IMPULSES CAUSED BY A DRUG WORKING ON NEUROTRANSMITTERS.THAT NIGHT, ON MUSHROOMS AND MOCLOBEMIDE IN PALENQUE, I SAW SOMETHING THAT IABSOLUTELY DID NOT WANT TO SEE—SOMETHING SO LUDICROUS, SO EMBARRASSING THAT IHESITATE TO TELL IT. LYING ON A BED IN A DARKENED ROOM WITH EYES CLOSED, IWATCHED RAPID BANDS OF GREEN AND YELLOW FLIMMERING ACROSS MY INNER VIEW SCREEN,TYPICAL OPTICAL EFFECTS, BUT THESE GREEN BLOBS SUDDENLY SHARPENED INTO FOCUS—THEKNOBS OF MY INTERNAL RECEIVER TURNING—UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF STARING AT A GROUP OFLAUGHING GREEN ELVES STANDING IN A LINE.THERE WERE MANY OF THEM. A MOB OF LITTLE PEOPLE IN TRADITIONAL GREEN OUTFITS ANDPEAKED CAPS. THE ELVES WERE JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND THEY WERE CHEERING. WHEN ISAW THEM, I COULD HEAR THEIR CHEERS FAINTLY IN MY EARS—“HOORAY!” THEY SEEMED TOBE WELCOMING ME, VERY HAPPY AND EXCITED BECAUSE I HAD SEEN THEM. WHAT WASALARMING ABOUT THIS APPARITION WAS THAT IT WAS LIKE A PHOTOGRAPHIC PROJECTION:THE ELVES WERE AS CLEAR TO MY INNER VISION AS FILM IMAGES. HOW COULD THISHAPPEN?OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE ANSWERS. THE ELVES COULD HAVE BEEN SOME FORMOF HIGH-RESOLUTION DELUSION. PERHAPS MY PREVIOUS PSYCHEDELIC ENDEAVORS WEREMAKING ME SUSCEPTIBLE TO NEW FORMS OF NUTTINESS. IF I AM GOING TO HALLUCINATE, ITHOUGHT BEFORE EATING THE MUSHROOMS, SHOW ME SOMETHING RELATED TO THE MAJESTICPALENQUE RUINS, EVOKE THE CRUEL AND SILENT MAYAN GODS. INSTEAD, HERE CONFRONTINGME WERE A BUNCH OF HAPPY ELVES. THIS WAS LEPRECHAUN KITSCH, AN OUTTAKE FROM ADISNEY FLICK. I HAD NO INTEREST IN ELVES AND WAS PERTURBED TO SEE THEM. PERHAPSSOME ELEMENT OF MY UNCONSCIOUS HAD GLOMMED ONTO THE “ELF ARCHETYPE” AND PULLEDIT UP FROM OUT OF MY CHILDHOOD. I KNEW MCKENNA’S WRITING ON DMT, AND I MIGHTHAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY IT, ALTHOUGH THESE ELVES WERE NOT TRANSFORMING AND NOTAT ALL MACHINELIKE. THEY WERE JUST NORMAL, GARDEN-VARIETY FAIRIES.ANOTHER OPTION TO CONSIDER:MARIA SABINA, THE FAMOUS MAZATEC SHAMANESS, CALLED THE MUSHROOMS SHE USED INDIVINATION AND HEALING “THE SACRED CHILDREN.” SHE SAID THAT THESE CHILDRENAPPEARED TO HER WHEN SHE ATE THE MUSHROOMS, AND THEY SHOWED HER HOW TO HEALPEOPLE, TOLD HER WHAT PLANTS TO USE, AND GENERALLY HELPED IN ALL OF HERUNDERTAKINGS. PERHAPS I WAS BEING ALLOWED A GLIMPSE OF SABINA’S “SACREDCHILDREN.” WAS IT MY CULTURAL BIAS OR A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON THAT THEY APPEAREDIDENTICAL TO THE TRADITIONAL “FAIRY FOLK” OR THE “GOOD NEIGHBORS”—THOSE ARCHAICSPIRITS OF THE WELSH AND IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, EXHAUSTIVELY CHRONICLED IN AWONDERFUL TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY BOOK BY DR. W. Y. EVANS-WENTZ CALLED THE FAIRYFOLK IN CELTIC COUNTRIES. EVANS-WENTZ TOOK HUNDREDS OF TESTIMONIES FROM COUNTRYFOLK AND LOCAL SEERS WHO HAD CONFRONTED THE FAIRIES—ACTUALLY, THERE SEEMED TO BEDIFFERENT HIERARCHIES OF SUPERNATURAL LOCALS, INCLUDING THE SIDDHI, THE “TALLSHINING ONES,” AND PYGMY FAIRIES SUCH AS GNOMES, LEPRECHAUNS, AND “LITTLEPEOPLE.” CONTRADICTING THE RESTRICTIVE DOGMATISM OF MODERN RATIONALISM,EVANS-WENTZ ARGUED THAT BECAUSE THESE PECULIAR DWELLERS IN THEIR SYLVAN WORLDSHAD BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY SO MANY OTHERWISE SENSIBLE CELTS, AND APPEARED AS SUCH AUNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN WORLD FOLKLORE, THEY HAD, IN SOME WAY, TO BE REAL."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31WHY DID YOU EAT US?[images/00006.jpg] A TENTATIVE EXPLORATION OF SUCH “MAGICAL” REALMS LEADS THESEEKER BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE “CONSENSUAL REALITY” OF WESTERN SCIENCE ANDHARD MATERIALISM WITH NO WAY TO RETURN. ONCE YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH “THE DOOR INTHE WALL,” THE LOOKING GLASS, THE GLASS CHRYSANTHEMUM, YOU ARE A PERMANENTEXILE, FOREVER ON THE OTHER SIDE LOOKING BACK—EXACTLY LIKE THOSE POOR LITTLEELVES, TRAPPED IN MY MIND, WAVING FRANTICALLY TO GET MY ATTENTION, TRYING TOTELL ME THAT THEY, TOO, EXIST, ALTHOUGH IN A WAY WE CAN’T FATHOM. ONCE YOU HAVESEEN THE ELVES, YOU MIGHT AS WELL TREPAN YOUR SKULL TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS.IN THE SOPHISTICATED CONTEMPORARY WORLD, IT SEEMS ABSURD TO PROPOSE THAT THEDISMISSED AND DISGRACED PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDS MIGHT BE REAL DOORWAYS TONEIGHBORING DIMENSIONS, AND WITHIN THOSE OTHER REALMS THERE ARE BEINGS WE CANCONTACT WHO ARE WAITING TO WELCOME US WITH DISCONCERTING GLEE. IT IS EVEN MOREABSURD TO SUGGEST THAT SOME OF THOSE BEINGS RESEMBLE OUR FOLKLORIC ARCHETYPES,BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SOURCE FOR THOSE ARCHETYPES IN THE FIRST PLACE.BEYOND EARLY CHILDHOOD, MOST OF US LEARN TO KEEP OUR MINDS SHUT TO THEPOSSIBILITY THAT OTHER WORLDS EXIST BEYOND THIS SEEMINGLY SOLID, DETERMINISTICONE THAT WE ACCEPT AS REALITY. WE ARE TRAINED, INDOCTRINATED, TO VOID THOSEASPECTS OF OUR BEING THAT BELONG TO THE REALMS OF INSIGHT, INTUITION, SPIRITUALMANIFESTATION, AND DREAM. THE NARROWED CONSCIOUSNESS OF “ADULTHOOD” IS A KIND OFRIGIDLY DEFINED TRANCE, CONTINUALLY REIMPRINTED ON US BY THE WORLD WE HAVECREATED. IF WE STUDIED THE MATTER, WE MIGHT DISCOVER THAT OUR MODERNPRESUMPTIONS OF RATIONALITY RELY ENTIRELY ON SECONDHAND INFORMATION, ON FAITH INWHAT “EXPERTS” HAVE TOLD US. THEY HAVE NO MORE BASIS IN “REALITY” THAN A VIVIDDREAM OR A CHILD’S FANTASY.I WATCHED THE EXCITABLE ELVES FOR A FEW MINUTES ONLY. THE SPECTACLE WAS MAKINGME TOO EXISTENTIALLY TENSE. AS THE EFFECTS OF THE MUSHROOMS WORE OFF, I GOT UPAND WENT FOR A WALK WITH ROBERT, MY NEW FRIEND, WHO WANTED TO TELL ME ABOUT HISLIFE.I HAD MET ROBERT ON THE BUFFET LINE AT LUNCH. GRAY-BEARDED, IN HIS EARLYFIFTIES, HE LOOKED A BIT LIKE A JOVIAL VERSION OF THE LATE HEMINGWAY. HE TOLD MEHE HAD BEEN DOING SHAMANIC WORK IN HAWAII AND MASSACHUSETTS, USING THE“AYAHUASCA ANALOGUE” OF MIMOSA HOSTILIS AND SYRIAN RUE.“THE AYAHUASCA VINE HAS A LONG HISTORY IN THE AMAZON,” ROBERT EXPLAINED. “THISOTHER MEDICINE HAS NO HISTORY—IT WAS ONLY DISCOVERED TEN YEARS AGO. ASWESTERNERS, WE CAN START FROM SCRATCH. WE CAN CREATE OUR OWN TRADITION.”I TOLD HIM I DIDN’T THINK WESTERNERS COULD BECOME SHAMANS. WE LACKED THEDISCIPLINE AND THE TRADITIONAL TRAINING METHODS, WHICH INCLUDE LONG PERIODS OFCELIBACY AND FASTING, PLUS NEARLY FATAL INGESTIONS OF TOBACCO JUICE AND VARIOUSHERBAL POTIONS. ROBERT SAID, QUIETLY, THAT HE HAD GONE THROUGH IT ALL IN HIS OWNWAY.ROBERT GREW UP IN MASSACHUSETTS. HE SAID HIS HOMETOWN WAS THE PLACE TO WHICH THEREMAINING WITCHES MOVED AFTER THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS DROVE THEM UNDERCOVER, ANDIT PRESERVED A TRADITION OF WITCHCRAFT, THE EUROPEAN RESIDUE OF SHAMANISM, UNTILTHE DEATH OF THE LAST WITCH IN 1950. YEARS AFTER HE MOVED AWAY, HE LEARNED THATTHE HOUSE IN WHICH HE GREW UP HAD BEEN HER HOME, A LOCAL LANDMARK IN THE TOWN.ROBERT SAID HIS FAMILY HAD LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS SINCE THE COLONIAL ERA. ONE OFHIS ANCESTORS EVEN CAME OVER ON THE MAYFLOWER. AS A YOUNG MAN, HE BEGAN TOEXPERIENCE, THROUGH DREAMS AND HINTS, A “CALL” TOWARD SHAMANISM.“I WAS IN MY MID-TWENTIES WHEN MY WIFE LEFT ME WITH TWO SMALL KIDS,” ROBERTRECALLED. “SHE RAN AWAY. LATER I FOUND THE HOUSE WHERE WE WERE LIVING WAS ON ALEY LINE, WHICH PROBABLY CAUSED SOME OF OUR PROBLEMS. ANYWAY, ONE NIGHT I HADTHIS DREAM. IN THE DREAM, A THUNDER CLOUD APPEARED OVER MY HEAD. IT REACHED DOWNAN ENORMOUS, MUSCULAR ARM, GRABBED ME, AND PULLED ME UP TOWARD THE CLOUD. IN THEDREAM I STRUGGLED AND JUST MANAGED TO BREAK FREE BEFORE I WAS TAKEN INSIDE THECLOUD. I FELL BACK TO EARTH AND, AT THAT MOMENT, WOKE UP. I LOOKED OUT THEWINDOW. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT SKY, FULL OF STARS, BUT JUST OUTSIDE MY WINDOWTHERE WAS ONE THUNDER CLOUD. THE CLOUD LET OUT THREE CLAPS OF THUNDER—BOOM!BOOM! BOOM!—AND FLOATED AWAY.”OVER THE NEXT MONTHS ROBERT DISCOVERED TWO UNUSUAL THINGS HAPPENING TO HIM ATTHE SAME TIME: “FIRST OF ALL, I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT I WAS BECOMING A WOMAN.I WAS GROWING BREASTS AND MY HORMONES WERE GOING HAYWIRE. MY GIRLFRIEND AT THETIME LEFT ME BECAUSE SHE SAID I HAD LOST MY ‘MALE ENERGY.’ ”AT THE SAME TIME HE LOST HIS MALENESS, HE WAS UNDERGOING ANOTHER CONFUSING ANDIMPROBABLE PROCESS: HE WAS DEVELOPING THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE WEATHER.“OF COURSE I DIDN’T BELIEVE IT, WHO WOULD? BUT I KEPT TESTING IT AND IT KEPTWORKING. IF I THOUGHT ABOUT RAIN, CLOUDS WOULD GATHER AND IT WOULD START TORAIN. IF I THOUGHT OF THE SUN, THE CLOUDS WOULD GO AWAY AND THE SUN WOULDAPPEAR.”AS HE WAS COMPREHENDING THIS SITUATION, HE STARTED TO LOSE HIS BREASTS. HERETURNED TO MANLINESS, AND HE COULD NO LONGER CONTROL ATMOSPHERIC FORCES. THEENTIRE EPISODE LASTED FIVE MONTHS. “IT WAS MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS LATER THAT IHAPPENED TO PICK UP A BOOK ABOUT NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURES.”RICHARD READ ABOUT THE LAKOTA, WHO HAD A TRADITIONAL FIGURE CALLED THE HEYOKA.THE HEYOKA WAS A KIND OF SHAMAN WHO LIVED AWAY FROM THE TRIBE, ON A HILL NEARBY,WITH THE ENTRANCE TO HIS TEPEE POINTED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. “THE HEYOKAALWAYS DRESSED IN WOMEN’S CLOTHING, AND TRADITIONALLY HE WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE THEPOWER TO CONTROL THE WEATHER.”“YOU WERE BECOMING A HEYOKA?”“THE LAKOTA BELIEVE THERE ARE THUNDER BEINGS WHO LIVE IN THE CLOUDS, AND THEYWANT HUMAN BEINGS TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE OF HEYOKA. NOW, THUNDER BEINGS LOOKAROUND AND THEY DON’T SEE ANY INDIANS. THEY NOMINATED ME AS A LIKELY CANDIDATE.”HE BELIEVES THAT, IF HE HADN’T WRIGGLED OUT OF THE THUNDER BEING’S GRASP IN THEDREAM, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THE ROLE OF HEYOKA. “THE WHOLE THING MAKESME WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN MENTAL INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE SOME SPIRITUALENTITY WAS TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THEM OR COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IN SOME WAY.”WHEN HE WAS IN HIS LATE TWENTIES, STILL LIVING IN MASSACHUSETTS AND WORKING AS AGARDENER (HE GARDENED FOR THE KENNEDYS FOR A WHILE), ROBERT HAD A DREAM IN WHICHHE SAW A PATCH OF RED-AND-YELLOW MUSHROOMS GROWING IN HIS BACKYARD, AND PICKEDAND ATE THEM. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, HE WENT INTO HIS BACKYARD AND HE FOUND THESAME MUSHROOMS GROWING IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN IN THE DREAM. HE LOOKEDTHE MUSHROOMS UP IN A BOOK AND LEARNED THAT THEY WERE AN AMERICAN STRAIN OF FLYAGARICS, OR AMANITA MUSCARIA (THE AMERICAN STRAIN IS RED AND YELLOW, WHILE THEASIAN VARIETY IS RED AND WHITE).FLY AGARICS ARE THE FAMOUS RED-CAPPED, WHITE-SPOTTED MUSHROOMS OF SIBERIANSHAMANISM. OFTEN CHARACTERIZED AS DEADLY POISONOUS IN MYCOLOGY GUIDES, THEMUSHROOMS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE A RANGE OF DISTORTIONS. THEY CAN MAKE OBJECTS INTHE WORLD SEEM MUCH BIGGER OR SMALLER, AN EFFECT LEWIS CARROLL HAD INCORPORATEDINTO ALICE IN WONDERLAND (IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER CARROLL HAD PERSONAL KNOWLEDGEOF THE “BEMUSHROOMED” STATE). GORDON WASSON ARGUED THAT AMANITA WAS THE SOMA OFTHE RIG VEDA.HERE IS HOW FLY AGARICS INSPIRED THE SANTA CLAUS LEGEND: IN SIBERIA, THEMUSHROOMS WERE RARE AND EXTREMELY VALUABLE—APPARENTLY ONE MUSHROOM COULD COSTTHE SAME AS A REINDEER. IBOTENIC ACID AND THE OTHER ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF THEMUSHROOM CONCENTRATE IN URINE, AND UP TO SEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE CAN SHARE THEINTOXICATION BY PASSING ALONG THEIR PISS. MANY SIBERIAN TRIBESMEN EVEN PREFERREDINGESTING THE PISS AS IT CAUSED LESS GASTRIC DISTRESS. REINDEER ALSO LOVED TODRINK THE MUSHROOM-SCENTED PISS. ALL A SIBERIAN NOMAD HAD TO DO WAS POUR A BITOF THE PISS ON THE GROUND AND REINDEER WOULD COME GALLOPING OVER FROM MILESAROUND. THIS ARCHAIC, SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP—REINDEER, RED- AND WHITE-CAPPEDBEINGS BRINGING GIFTS FROM THE OTHER WORLD, THE FROZEN TUNDRA—WAS INCORPORATED,CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT, INTO THE STORY OF SANTA CLAUS.ROBERT DRIED THE MUSHROOMS FROM HIS BACKYARD AND ARRANGED TO EAT THEM WITH AFRIEND. ONE NIGHT THEY ATE THREE MUSHROOMS EACH. AN HOUR AND A HALF PASSED.ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED. “WE WERE DISAPPOINTED. I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TOGET A BEER FROM THE FRIDGE,” HE RECALLED. “I TOOK OUT THE BEER, TURNED AROUND,AND ACROSS THE KITCHEN THERE WERE THREE HUGE MUSHROOMS STARING AT ME—AFIVE-FOOT-TALL, A FOUR-FOOT-TALL, AND A THREE-FOOT-TALL MUSHROOM. THE MUSHROOMSWERE RED AND YELLOW AND THEY HAD LITTLE EYES AND LITTLE MOUTHS. THEY LOOKED JUSTAS SOLID AND REAL AS ME OR YOU.”HE STARED AT THE MUSHROOMS. THE MUSHROOMS STARED AT HIM. FINALLY, THE LARGEST OFTHE MUSHROOMS SPOKE TO HIM.“WHY DID YOU EAT US?” IT ASKED.HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. “I WAS JUST FOLLOWING MY DREAM.”THE MUSHROOMS CONFERRED WITH EACH OTHER. FINALLY THEY SEEMED SATISFIED BY HISANSWER. “BUT ARE YOU PREPARED TO FOLLOW THIS PATH?” THE TALLEST FLY AGARICASKED.ROBERT ANSWERED, INTUITIVELY AND WITHOUT HESITATION, “YES, I AM.” WHEREUPON THEMUSHROOMS VANISHED. FIFTEEN YEARS PASSED BEFORE ROBERT REALIZED THAT THE PATH HEHAD AGREED TO FOLLOW WAS PLANT SHAMANISM. HE TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT A FRIEND WHOATE FLY AGARICS YEARS LATER. THE MUSHROOM SPIRITS SHOWED UP IN THE SAMESURPRISING MANNER, AND ASKED THE SAME QUESTION: “WHY DID YOU EAT US?” HIS FRIENDSAID, “I WAS TRYING TO GET HIGH.” THE MUSHROOMS SAID, “WELL, IF YOU EVER DO THISAGAIN, WE’RE GOING TO KILL YOU.”ROBERT NOW THOUGHT THE FLY AGARICS BELONGED TO SOME OTHER-DIMENSIONALCIVILIZATION. THEY WERE VISITORS TO OUR WORLD, MAKING THEIR OWN JOURNEY THROUGHTHE COSMOS. AND TO A LIMITED EXTENT, WHEN IT SUITED THEM, THEY INVOLVEDTHEMSELVES IN HUMAN AFFAIRS. IN HIS BOOK ON VISIONARY PLANT USE THROUGH HISTORY,THE LONG TRIP, WHICH WAS UNKNOWN TO ROBERT, PAUL DEVEREUX DESCRIBES COMMONFEATURES OF AMANITA INTOXICATION: “THE SPIRITS OF THE MUSHROOMS MIGHT APPEAR TOTHE INDIVIDUAL AND CONVERSE WITH HIM DIRECTLY. HE MIGHT EVEN FEEL HIMSELFTURNING INTO A MUSHROOM SPIRIT. THE MUSHROOM SPIRITS TEND TO WEAR WIDE HATS ONHEADS THAT SIT ON STOUT CYLINDRICAL BODIES WITHOUT AN INTERVENING NECK, AND THENUMBER SEEN DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF MUSHROOMS EATEN.”I ASKED MYSELF WHETHER I BELIEVED ROBERT’S STORIES, AND I DECIDED THAT I DID. IDON’T MEAN THAT I BELIEVED HE BELIEVED THEM; I MEAN I BELIEVED THE THINGS HEDESCRIBED HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE. MY EXISTENTIAL CERTITUDES WERE BEING GIVENANOTHER TWIST. IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT BY NOW. WE WALKED AROUND THE HOTEL GROUNDS,SAT BY A STREAM WHERE SMALL UNFAMILIAR ANIMALS DARTED ALONG, QUICKSILVER FLASHESNIBBLING AT THE EDGE OF THE BLACK WATER. ROBERT TURNED AWAY FROM MUSHROOMSPIRITS AND THUNDER BEINGS AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT AMERICA, ITS RUTHLESSMATERIALISM AND ITS INGRAINED AND UNCONSCIOUS HATRED OF NATIVE SPIRITUALITY.“IF YOU COMPARE THE U.S. POLICIES AGAINST THE INDIANS WITH THEIR POLICY TOWARDTHE BLACKS, YOU CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE,” HE SAID. “AFTER SLAVERY ENDED, THE BLACKSWERE ALLOWED TO LIVE AS AMERICANS. I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THEIR NATIVE SPIRITUALTRADITIONS WERE TOTALLY WIPED OUT. THEY DIDN’T POSE A THREAT ANYMORE. THEINDIANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, NEVER LOST THEIR DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE SPIRITUALWORLD. I THINK THAT IS THE REAL REASON OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED SO HARD TODESTROY THEM.”YEARS AGO ROBERT VISITED A MASSACHUSETTS TRIBE WITH FRIENDS WHO WERE STARTING ANORGANIC FARMING COMMUNE—IN THE CURRENT LINGO AN “INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY”—DOWNSOUTH. THEY WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE, NONDESTRUCTIVE AGRICULTURETHE INDIANS HAVE PRACTICED FOR CENTURIES. “WHEN WE CAME TO MEET THE TRIBE, THEYSAID RIGHT AWAY, ‘OH WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU’RE THE TREE PEOPLE!’ IT TURNS OUTTHEY HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF PROPHECIES ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXTDECADES, AND THEY JUST KEEP CROSSING ITEMS OFF THEIR LIST AS THEY COME UP.”ROBERT ACCEPTS THE INDIGENOUS COSMOLOGY POPULATED BY REALMS OF SPIRITS ANDELEMENTAL BEINGS. HE THINKS THAT AMERICA, DESPITE ITS PROLIFERATION OF CHRISTIANFUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS AND CRACKPOT CULTS, IS SPIRITUALLY BEREFT. WE HAVE BEENABANDONED BY THE SPIRITS, AS THE TARAHUMARA SHAMAN TOLD POOR ARTAUD.SHAMANISM IS A PHENOMENON THAT COMES UP THROUGH THE EARTH WHEN HUMAN BEINGS ARECONNECTED TO THEIR HOME. OVER TIME, THIS NATURAL CONNECTION TO THE LANDMANIFESTS IN SUPERNATURAL WAYS. BECAUSE ROBERT’S FAMILY HAD BEEN INMASSACHUSETTS SINCE COLONIAL TIMES, HE WAS OFFERED A SHAMANIC ROLE BY THE LOCALELEMENTAL FORCES. HE WAS A SPECIAL CASE. BY THE TIME THEY BECOME ADULTS, MOSTMODERN CITIZENS ARE SO ALIENATED FROM THEMSELVES AND THE EARTH, INDOCTRINATED BYMEDIA, AND DELUDED BY THE “FALSE NEEDS” OF THE CONSUMER CULTURE THAT THEY HAVELITTLE HOPE OF CONNECTING WITH THE OTHER WORLDS SURROUNDING THEM.“I HAD TO GIVE MY OWN SON A HUGE DOSE OF THE MEDICINE TO WAKE UP HIS SPIRIT,”ROBERT RECALLED. “I NEARLY KILLED HIM. HE WENT SO FAR OUT, I COULDN’T BRING HIMAROUND FOR A LONG TIME. I PUSHED HIM UNDER THE COLD SHOWER, HELD HIM THERE FORFIFTEEN MINUTES. FINALLY HE CAME BACK TO ME.”ROBERT IS STILL DEVELOPING HIS OWN SHAMANIC ABILITIES. ONE NIGHT A WOMAN IN HISAYAHUASCA GROUP WAS POSSESSED BY MALEVOLENT FORCES. HE FOUND HIMSELF MAKINGGESTURES THAT SUDDENLY CAME TO HIM—“I FELT I WAS THROWING HER SPIRIT BACK IN HERBODY.” THE ETHERIC ENERGY SURROUNDING HER SEEMED TO JUMP AWAY FROM HER AND LEAPINTO HIS BELLY. FROM HIS BELLY, HE SPAT IT OUT IN GOBS OF PHLEGM. THISCONVERSION OF EVIL-SPIRIT ENERGY INTO YUCKY PHYSICAL STUFF IS SOMETHINGDESCRIBED IN MANY BOOKS ABOUT SHAMANISM (I HAVE SINCE SEEN TRIBAL SHAMANS DOIT), BUT I HAD NEVER HEARD AN ACCOUNT FROM A WESTERN INSIDER BEFORE.“I SUSPECT THAT I AM AN AGENT FOR WHATEVER SPIRITUAL POWERS I REPRESENT,” HESAID. “SOMETIMES I FEEL MORE LIKE AN AGENT THAN A PERSON. I COMMUNICATE WITH MYCLIENTS PSYCHICALLY—THEY TELL ME WHAT THEY WANT ME TO DO IN MY DREAMS AND I DOIT.” HE STUBBED OUT HIS CIGARETTE. “THIS IS GOING TO SOUND CRAZY TO YOU. I HAVETHESE LONG DREAMS WHERE I AM GIVEN PERSONAL TOURS THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE ANDTHE CURRENT PRESIDENT INVITES ME TO DINNER. I HAD SOME GOOD MEETINGS WITHCLINTON, EVEN WITH REAGAN. BUT I COULD NEVER REACH BUSH, AND I DOUBT I WILL GETTHROUGH TO HIS SON.”“WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE DREAMS MEAN?”“THROUGH THE DREAMS I AM LIKE AN AMBASSADOR FOR THESE OTHER FORCES, TRYING TOINTERCEDE FOR THEM.”I WAS LISTENING, SEMIDETACHED, TO ROBERT’S SHAMANIC SPEW, WHEN I SUDDENLYREALIZED WHAT I HAD BEEN DOING SINCE MY TRIP TO GABON: I HAD BEEN WORKING TOWAKE UP MY SPIRIT. MY INTELLECTUAL DRIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING WAS COVER FOR MYSPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT. IN FACT, THE BWITI INITIATION HAD BEGUN A SEMIAUTONOMOUSPROCESS GIVING ME INCREASING ACCESS TO WHAT I COULD ONLY THINK OF AS “THE SPIRITWORLD.” I WAS GETTING HINTS OF THIS THROUGH MY DREAMS, PLUS THE DEEPENINGVISIONS FROM AYAHUASCA AND OTHER PSYCHEDELICS. EVEN THE ELVES DEMONSTRATED THATMY CHANNELS WERE OPEN TO NEW FREQUENCIES—THE ELVES, I THOUGHT, HAD MANIFESTEDTHEMSELVES ONLY BECAUSE I WAS READY FOR THEM.AT THE TIME I RETURNED FROM GABON, THE BWITI TRIP HAD SEEMED LIKE A JOKE, LATERA PROFOUNDLY PERSONAL REVELATION; NOW I REALIZED IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.THROUGH IBOGA I HAD SEEN MY “SELF” AS A KIND OF OBJECT, A PROJECTION FROM SOMEDEEPER ORDER. I HAD REALIZED MY CONNECTION TO A TRANSPERSONAL REALITY, SOMESOURCE THAT EXISTED OUTSIDE LINEAR TIME. OVER THE SPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS, THEEFFECT WAS A DEEPENING SENSE OF CERTAINTY. TO THE EXTREMELY LIMITED EXTENT I HADSTARTED TO KNOW IT, THE “SPIRIT WORLD” SEEMED TO WORK ON IMPERSONAL ORUNCONSCIOUS PRINCIPLES. IT WAS LIKE A COSMIC BUREAUCRACY EMPLOYING ITS OWN PRDEPARTMENT, ITS OWN OFF-KILTER DREAM-LOGIC AND SENSE OF HUMOR. THE SPIRIT FORCESWERE CONSTANTLY PLAYING WITH HUMAN LIMITATIONS, DANGLING POSSIBILITIES BEFOREOUR PUNY GRASPS AT KNOWLEDGE.OF COURSE RICHARD WAS A GARDENER BY TRADE. OF COURSE HE WAS THE KENNEDY’SGARDENER. MY NEW ARCHETYPE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD REVEALED A PATTERN THATWORKED ON EVERY LEVEL. IF IT WAS MADNESS, IT WAS A DELIRIOUSLY LOGICAL MADNESS.THE PLANTS, AND THE TRANSFORMATIVE KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THEM, ARE AT THE CENTER OFTHE STORY—“THE MATRIX OF ALL POSSIBLE STORIES,” AS GINZBURG DESCRIBED IT.. . .“IT IS NECESSARY TO CULTIVATE YOUR GARDEN,” VOLTAIRE WROTE. AT THE END OFCANDIDE, THE APHORISM IS OFFERED AS MELANCHOLY CONSOLATION, BUT IT NOW SEEMEDTHE OPPOSITE. LIVING IN THE NONPSYCHEDELIC AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT, VOLTAIRE COULDNOT HAVE SUSPECTED THE POWERS OF PSYCHIC TRANSFORMATION HIDDEN WITHIN GREENGROWING THINGS.ANOTHER LECTURER AT THE PALENQUE CONFERENCE WAS KATHLEEN HARRISON, ANETHNOBOTANIST, ONCE THE WIFE OF TERENCE MCKENNA. BEAUTIFUL, BLACK-HAIRED, IN HERLATE FORTIES, SHE WORKED WITH THE MAZATECS, LIVING WITH A FAMILY OF HEALERS FORA FEW MONTHS EVERY YEAR. THE MAZATEC LANGUAGE AND CULTURE HAS BEEN PROTECTEDBECAUSE THEY INHABIT INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS. HARRISON TALKED ABOUT LIFE IN THEMOUNTAINS, FAR FROM ROADS. “WHEN YOU WALK A STONE PATH, YOU LOOK, YOU MONITOR.EVERY DAY IS A PILGRIMAGE, A CYCLE.” WHILE INACCESSIBILITY PROTECTS NATIVECULTURES, ROADS THREATEN THEM WITH ACCULTURATION AND LOSS OF TRADITION.THE MUSHROOMS, CENTRAL TO MAZATEC TRADITIONS, COME IN MANY VARIETIES. EACHVARIANT HAS ITS OWN PURPOSE. “THE MUSHROOMS ARE DIFFERENT BEINGS,” SHE SAID. ONEIS USED FOR DIVINATION, ANOTHER FOR HEALING, ANOTHER FOR GOOD LUCK UPON STARTINGA NEW UNDERTAKING. THIS METICULOUS DISCRIMINATION REMINDED ME OF THE INDIANS INTHE AMAZON WHO RECOGNIZE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF AYAHUASCA VINE, EACH ONECAUSING DIFFERENT VISIONS. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE IMPERCEPTIBLE, EVEN TO HIGHLYTRAINED WESTERN BOTANISTS. AS LÉVI-STRAUSS DESCRIBED IN THE SAVAGE MIND, INDIANSARE ATTUNED TO BOTANICAL SUBTLETIES AT A LEVEL BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION.HARRISON SPOKE OF ANOTHER VISIONARY PLANT, SALVIA DIVINORUM. A PLANT FROM THEMINT FAMILY, IT WAS ONLY DISCOVERED BY THE WEST IN THE 1950S. DIFFUSION OFINFORMATION ABOUT SALVIA HAS BEEN SLOW, WHICH IS FITTING, AS THE EXPERIENCE OFTHIS PLANT IS SUBTLE—ACCORDING TO THE MAZATECS, HER SPIRIT IS “SHY LIKE A DEER.”I HAD TRIED SALVIA SEVERAL TIMES IN NEW YORK AND FOUND IT UNPREDICTABLE, RANGINGFROM DISSOCIATIVE TO EMPATHIC. IT HAD A PECULIARLY ORTHOGONAL EFFECT, AS THOUGHGIVING A VIEW INTO A UNIVERSE LINKED, AT AN ODD DIAGONAL ANGLE, WITH OUR OWN. ONMY FIRST ATTEMPT, I FELT AS IF I WAS TRAPPED FOREVER IN A TIME-LOOP, ALTHOUGHTHE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE LASTED LESS THAN FIVE FRIGHTENING MINUTES.WHEN YOU STUDY PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS, BOTANICAL DETAILS BECOME SIGNIFICANT. THEPERSONALITY OF THE PLANT, OR ITS SPIRIT, EXPRESSES ITSELF IN ITS WAY OF GROWING,ITS HABITS OF DEVELOPMENT, ITS HISTORY OF HUMAN USE. SALVIA IS A SQUARE-STEMMEDPLANT THAT GROWS STRAIGHT UP, ITS STALKS AND LEAVES REACHING OUT IN SYMMETRICALPAIRS. IT IS A PURE CULTIGEN, WHICH MEANS IT CANNOT BE FOUND IN THE WILD. THEPLANT WAS ONLY DISCOVERED, BY GORDON WASSON, IN THE GARDENS OF A HANDFUL OFMAZATEC HEALERS. ALTHOUGH IT FLOWERS IN WHITE BLOSSOMS (IN A SLIDE PROJECTED BYHARRISON, THE SALVIA FLOWER LOOKED SPECTACULAR, ANGELIC), SALVIA NEVER, ORALMOST NEVER, PRODUCES SEEDS. TO PROPAGATE ITSELF, IT GROWS UNTIL IT REACHES ACERTAIN HEIGHT, THEN FALLS OVER, AND WHERE IT FALLS, A NEW PLANT SHOOTS UP. THEMAZATECS HAVE NO MYTHOLOGY, NO FOLKLORE, TO EXPLAIN SALVIA—THEY ALSO CALL IT SKAPASTORA, THE LEAVES OF THE SHEPHERDESS, AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE VIRGINMARY—AND IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW LONG THEY HAVE USED IT. THE PLANT IS SURROUNDED BYA DELICATE AURA OF SECRECY.THE PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENT OF SALVIA, SALVINORIN A, IS POTENT IN DOSES MEASUREDIN MICROGRAMS, SIMILAR IN POWER TO LSD. GENERALLY ONLY NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDSAFFECT THE BRAIN, BUT THE SALVINORIN A MOLECULE IS NOT NITROGEN-BASED.TECHNICALLY, THE CHEMICAL IS SOMETHING CALLED A NEOCLERODANE-DITERPENOID, MADEUP OF CARBON, HYDROGEN, AND OXYGEN ATOMS. THE NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS OF ITSACTIVITY ON HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN.ONE YEAR BEFORE HER VISIT TO THE MAZATECS, HARRISON HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITHARRHYTHMIA, AN ALTERATION IN THE RHYTHM OF THE HEARTBEAT. HER DOCTORS WANTED TOTREAT HER WITH MEDICATION OR SURGERY. SHE PUT OFF TREATMENT UNTIL AFTER HERTRIP. IN OAXACA, THE SHAMANS SUGGESTED A SALVIA CEREMONY. THEY ATE A THICK CIGARMADE FROM FRESH LEAVES, WHICH CAN GROW TO NINE INCHES IN LENGTH. “WE PERFORMEDTHE RITUAL IN TOTAL DARKNESS,” SHE RECALLED. “THEY TOLD ME I HAD TO PRAY OUTLOUD WITH THEM, TO BESEECH THE SALVIA SPIRIT, AND NOT TO LAUGH. THEY SAIDLAUGHTER SCARES AWAY THE SPIRIT.”SUDDENLY SHE WAS NO LONGER IN THE DARK, ROUGH-WALLED TEMPLE. SHE SAW THAT SHEWAS IN A LARGE GARDEN. ACROSS THE GARDEN WAS A “BEAUTIFUL WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITEAND ABOUT TEN FEET TALL,” SILENTLY TENDING TO THE PLANTS. “AS I LOOKED AROUND, ISAW I WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE SHAMAN AND HIS WIFE IN THE LAST ROW OF PLANTS.THEY TOLD ME TO KEEP PRAYING. I REALIZED THAT WE WERE ALSO PLANTS IN HERGARDEN.” THE TALL WOMAN—THE SALVIA SPIRIT—SLOWLY MADE HER WAY TO HARRISON. INTHE VISION, THE SPIRIT PASSED ITS HAND RIGHT THROUGH HER. “IT WAS A WONDERFULFEELING, A TINGLING WARMTH GOING THROUGH ME,” SHE SAID. “I WISHED THAT I WOULDALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY.” THE GARDEN VISION BEGAN TO FADE. SHE BEGGED THE SPIRITFOR GUIDANCE, ASKED WHAT SHE SHOULD DO WITH HER WORK AS A BOTANIST. SHE WASTOLD, SOFTLY, “SHOW THEM THE EDGE OF THE GARDEN.” BACK IN THE UNITED STATES, SHEWENT TO THE HOSPITAL, AND WAS TOLD THAT HER HEART PROBLEM HAD VANISHED. IN AREVERSAL OF ROLES, THE PLANT HAD REVEALED ITSELF AS A GARDENER OF HUMAN BEINGS.THERE ARE MANY ACCOUNTS ON THE INTERNET OF PEOPLE TAKING SALVIA WITHOUTKNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANT’S RITUAL MEANING OR USE. ONE ACCOUNT DESCRIBED INSTANTTRANSPORTATION INTO THE SALVIA REALM AFTER SMOKING TWO HITS OF AN EXTRACT: I FELT A TALL, FEMALE ENTITY PUT HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND . . . PHYSICALLYPULL ME BACKWARDS. I THEN BECAME AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF A NUMBER OF THESESTRANGE ENTITIES, THEY SEEMED TO BE SURROUNDING ME IN A CIRCLE OR SEMICIRCLE. IREMEMBER HEARING PHRASES SPOKEN SHARPLY IN SOME LANGUAGE UNKNOWN TO ME. THESEBEINGS WANTED ME TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING: I THINK IT WAS THEIRNAME. . . . I KNOW THIS SOUNDS FUCKING CRAZY, BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE “DIVORUM,”AND/OR “DIVINORUM—SALVIA DIVINORUM.” . . . I FELT AS IF I WERE BEINGINTERROGATED BY A PANEL OF SUPERIOR LIFE FORMS. . . . I BELIEVE THAT PART OF THEMESSAGE THE SPIRIT WAS TRYING TO MAKE VERY CLEAR WAS THAT SALVIA IS TRULYDIVINE—“OF THE GODS,” AND MUST BE APPROACHED WITH CARE AND RESPECT. STORIES SUCH AS KAT’S AND ROBERT’S ARE CERTAINLY SUGGESTIVE, BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOTHEY SUGGEST? ARE THEY ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE OF SOME KIND OF OTHER ORDERMANIFESTING ITSELF THROUGH THE LOST DOMAINS OF NATURE? OR ARE THEY NO DIFFERENTFROM REPORTS OF FAITH HEALERS OR PSYCHICS, ALIEN ABDUCTEES OR VISIONARIES,INDICATING LATENT POWERS OR QUIRKS OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED?IF WE CAN ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE NOT MASS-DELUSIONS OR CON JOBS OR SYNAPTICFRITZES, THEN ALL OF THESE PHENOMENA, TAKEN TOGETHER, REVEAL DEEP AND COMPLEXLEVELS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE HUMAN MIND, PHYSICAL REALITY, AND THE NATURAL(AND SUPERNATURAL) WORLD.PERHAPS THESE WORDS FROM A PERUVIAN SHAMAN HELP TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN HEALER AND HERBS: “THE CURANDERO, UPON INVOKING THE POWER OF THE PLANTSWITHIN HIS CURATIVE POWER, ALSO INFLUENCES THEM. HE IMPOSES HIS PERSONALSPIRITUAL FORCE OVER THE PLANTS, GIVING THEM THAT MAGIC POWER WHICH BECOMES, LETUS SAY, THE POWER THAT PLANTS CONTAIN AS A RESULT OF HAVING BEEN ROOTED IN THEEARTH AND PARTAKEN OF ITS MAGNETIC FORCE. AND SINCE MAN IS AN ELEMENT OF THEEARTH, WITH THE POWER OF HIS INTELLIGENCE HE EMITS THIS POTENTIALITY OVER THEPLANTS. THE PLANTS RECEIVE THIS INFLUENCE AND RETURN IT TOWARD MAN, TOWARD THEINDIVIDUAL IN THE MOMENT WHEN HE INVOKES. IN OTHER WORDS, ALL OF THE SPIRIT OFTHE PLANTS IS FORTIFIED BY THE INFLUENCES—INTELLECTUAL, SPIRITUAL, AND HUMAN—OFMAN. HE IS THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MAGIC POTENTIALITY OF THE PLANTS.”FOR THE MAZATECS, ACCORDING TO HARRISON, “THE LEAVES OF A PLANT HOLD ANDTRANSFER ENERGY.” THEY BELIEVE “THAT PLANTS ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN ENERGYTRANSMISSION. THE INHERENT CHARACTER AND ENERGY IN PLANT MATERIAL IS BEHIND ALOT OF THEIR RITUALS.” THE ENERGY OF THE PLANTS IS A TRUE SOURCE OF HEALING.IT WAS A GREAT PLEASURE TO HEAR HARRISON TALK ABOUT THE MAZATECS, THE NATIVERELATION TO PLANTS, THE SPECTACULAR POWERS OF PLANT MEDICINE. THE BRAND-NEWGNOSIS OF PSYCHEDELIA IN THE WESTERN WORLD HAS BEEN, THROUGHOUT ITS BRIEF ANDVOLATILE ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR HISTORY, MALE-DOMINATED TERRITORY, WITH WORDS BY LEARYAND CASTANEDA AND KESEY, SET TO MUSIC BY PINK FLOYD AND JIM MORRISON. HARRISONCONTEXTUALIZED THE SUBJECT FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF FEMALE DEPTH AND COMPASSION;LIKE THE STRIKING OF A BELL, HERS IS A NEW TONE IN THE DISCOURSE.TO HEAR HER SPEAK WAS TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS AREA OF PLANT-WISDOM MIGHTBECOME: NOT SOME FRINGE NEW AGE ELEMENT OR MIDDLE-CLASS NIGHTMARE, BUT A SOURCEOF REDEMPTIVE ENERGY FOR A SOCIETY IN DENIAL ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON THE PLANET, ANDSPIRITUAL DESPAIR. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF RITUAL IN PSYCHEDELIC USE,OF CREATING SOME KIND OF CONTEXT, INTENTION, AND “SACRED SPACE,” RATHER THANJUST SPACING OUT. “I SEE SO MANY PEOPLE WALLOWING IN CONFUSION AND PHYSICALSELF-DESTRUCTION, COMING FROM A CULTURE WHERE THEY HAVE NO TRAINING, AT LOOSEENDS. I DON’T SEE HOW IT IS HELPING THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE COLLECTIVE THE WAY ITIS BEING DONE NOW.”THIS WAS ROBERT’S POINT ALSO. THE FOUNDERS OF THE ENTHEOBOTANY CONFERENCE,MCKENNA AMONG THEM, HAD DONE VALUABLE WORK, SCOURING THE WORLD FOR NEW MAGICALPLANTS, LEARNING FROM THE SHAMANS, TESTING NEW COMBINATIONS OF HERBAL EXTRACTSAND CHEMICALS FROM DIFFERENT CLIMATES. BUT THE NEXT QUESTION IS ONE OF UTILITY:WHAT TO DO WITH WHAT HAS BEEN LEARNED?DURING HIS LECTURE, JONATHAN OTT, THE AUTHOR OF PHARMOCOTHEON, AN ENCYCLOPEDICSOURCE BOOK ON SHAMANIC INEBRIANTS, SAID THAT WESTERNERS COULDN’T BECOME SHAMANSIN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE. “I DON’T THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE IN OUR WORLDTO BE A SHAMAN. THEY ARE THE SCIENTISTS OF THE PRELITERATE WORLD. THE CLOSESTTHING IN OUR WORLD IS PEOPLE LIKE SASHA SHULGIN, TERENCE, OR ME.”ROBERT CONVINCED ME THAT OTT WAS WRONG. THERE WERE LIMITS TO LEARY’S ANDALPERTS’S HEDONIST/THERAPEUTIC MODEL OF PSYCHEDELIC USE—OR EVEN THEQUACK-SCIENTIST-MYSTIC MODEL OF MCKENNA AND OTT. PERHAPS THE ONLY WAY TO GOBEYOND THOSE LIMITS IS TO PLUNGE INTO SHAMANISM AS A LIVING SPIRITUAL PRACTICE,AS ROBERT HAS DONE. MCKENNA SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE THIS HIMSELF: “THE LAST BESTHOPE FOR DISSOLVING THE STEEP WALLS OF CULTURAL INFLEXIBILITY THAT APPEAR TO BECHANNELING US TOWARD TRUE RUIN IS A RENEWED SHAMANISM,” HE WROTE. “BYREESTABLISHING CHANNELS OF DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER, THE MIND BEHINDNATURE, THROUGH THE USE OF HALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS, WE WILL OBTAIN A NEW SET OFLENSES TO SEE OUR WAY IN THE WORLD.” ALTHOUGH EXCISED FROM WESTERN CULTURE,SHAMANISM IS A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON, INTEGRAL TO THE HUMAN RELATIONSHIP WITH THEPLANET THAT GIVES US LIFE. “IT COMES UP FROM THE EARTH,” ROBERT SAID."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32THROWN-AWAYKNOWLEDGE[images/00006.jpg] I TOOK AN AFTERNOON OFF FROM LECTURES TO EXPLORE THEPALENQUE RUINS. PALENQUE WAS, UNTIL THE NINTH CENTURY, A MAJOR CEREMONIALCENTER, A HUGE CITY AND MAYAN TEMPLE COMPLEX ABANDONED FOR UNKNOWN REASONS ATTHE PINNACLE OF ITS POWER. THE CITY WAS LOST IN THE JUNGLE, OVERGROWN ANDFORGOTTEN TO EVERYONE EXCEPT THE LOCAL, SECRETIVE, LAOCONDON INDIANS, UNTIL ITSREDISCOVERY IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. MOST OF ITS STRUCTURES ARE YET TO BEUNEARTHED OR HALF-CONSUMED BY THE JUNGLE. WALKING OFF THE PATH, YOU FIND LARGEPILES OF ROCKS THAT ARE THE CRUMBLED REMNANTS OF ANCIENT TEMPLES. ATOP THETEMPLE OF THE SMOKING GOD THERE IS A FABULOUS FRIEZE OF A SMIRKING SHAMANICMASTER HOLDING A LONG PIPE WITH TENDRILS OF SMOKE CURLING OUT—DMT ANYONE?ANOTHER FAMOUS CARVING, PRESERVED AT THE PALENQUE MUSEUM, IS THE COVER OF THETOMB OF PAKAL, PALENQUE’S GREAT KING. THE ORNATE TABLEAU EITHER DEPICTS PAKALFALLING DOWN THROUGH THE JAWLIKE GATES OF THE UNDERWORLD OR, ACCORDING TO UFORESEARCHER JACQUES VALLEE, OPERATING THE CONTROLS OF A JEWELED SPACESHIP.ANOTHER CARVING SHOWS PRIESTS CLUSTERED AROUND A SMALL ENTITY IDENTIFIED AS ONEOF THE “GODS.” THIS CREATURE, PLUG-SHAPED AND OTHERWORLDLY, RESEMBLED THESQUIGGLY EXTRADIMENSIONAL BEINGS THAT I SAW DURING THE YAGÉ CEREMONIES OF THESECOYA.PALENQUE MAY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED, ALONG WITH MANY MAYAN CENTERS, BECAUSE OF SOMEPROPHECY, SOME DIVINE ORDER, OR PERHAPS THE CALENDAR FORETOLD CATASTROPHE—NOBODYKNOWS FOR CERTAIN. HOWEVER, IT IS KNOWN THAT, IN CENTRAL AMERICA, ASTRONOMY ANDASTROLOGY WERE HIGHLY DEVELOPED ENTERPRISES. CENTURIES LATER, DUE TO PROPHECIESBASED ON ASTRONOMICAL CONJUNCTIONS, THE AZTECS EXPECTED THE APPEARANCE OF A“WHITE GOD” ON THE EXACT DATE THAT CORTÉS ARRIVED—THAT IS WHY THEY FAILED TO PUTUP AN EFFECTIVE STRUGGLE DESPITE THEIR VAST ADVANTAGE IN NUMBERS.INSPIRED BY PSYCHEDELIC VISIONS, MCKENNA STUDIED ACCELERATING NOVELTY AND THE ICHING AND PREDICTED AN AS-OF-YET UNIMAGINABLE SUMMATION IN THE YEAR 2012. HELATER FOUND THAT THE MAYAN CALENDAR PROPHESIES THE END OF THE PRESENT HISTORICALERA AND THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CYCLE IN 2012, AT THE MOMENT WHEN OUR SUN COMESINTO MOMENTARY ALIGNMENT WITH THE GALACTIC CENTER.MCKENNA THEORIZED THAT THE LINEAR STRUCTURE OF TIME COULD BE A TEMPORARYILLUSION, AND THAT TIME MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A WAVE FORM, FRACTAL, OR SPIRAL. HEUSED THE “KING WEN” SEQUENCE OF THE I CHING TO PLOT TIME AS A WAVE FORMREPRESENTING INCREASING COMPLEXITY OR THE “INGRESSION OF NOVELTY” INTO HUMANCONSCIOUSNESS. HE SPECULATED THAT IN THE LAST YEARS LEADING UP TO THE CREST ANDCOLLAPSE OF THIS WAVE, WE MIGHT SEE A SPEEDED-UP REPLAY OF ALL OF HUMAN HISTORYAS CARTOON FARCE. BY THIS LOGIC, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER MIGHTBE IN “RESONANCE” WITH THE TOWER OF BABEL, WHILE THE GLOBAL MILITARY CAMPAIGN OFTHE UNITED STATES MIGHT RESONATE WITH THE RAPID EXPANSION AND COLLAPSE OF THEROMAN EMPIRE OR THE CRUSADES. HE PROPOSED THAT THE CURRENT SIMULTANEOUSPROCESSES OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE AND GLOBAL DESTRUCTION MIGHT BE SOMETHINGLIKE A CHRYSALIS STAGE, IN WHICH HUMANITY WAS INCUBATING TECHNOLOGY, AWAITING ADIMENSIONAL SHIFT, OR PREPARING THE WAY FOR AN EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.USING MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS ELABORATED IN A COMPUTER PROGRAM, “TIME WAVEZERO,” MCKENNA PROJECTED 2012—DECEMBER 21, TO BE EXACT—AS A MAJOR TRANSFORMATIONPOINT IN HUMAN HISTORY. PERHAPS THE END OF HISTORY AS WE NOW KNOW IT. HEPRESENTED THIS AS A POTENTIALLY POSITIVE THING, THE ENTRY INTO HYPERSPACE ANDGALACTIC CITIZENSHIP. THE “CONCRESCENCE POINT” COULD BE “THE CULMINATION OF AHUMAN PROCESS, A PROCESS OF TOOLMAKING,” HE WROTE IN HIS BOOK THE INVISIBLELANDSCAPE. “THE APPEARANCE IN NORMAL SPACE-TIME OF A HYPERDIMENSIONAL BODY,OBEDIENT TO A SIMULTANEOUSLY TRANSFORMED AND RESURRECTED HUMAN WILL . . . MAY BEAPOCALYPSE ENOUGH.”MCKENNA’S WRITINGS ON 2012 CONTRIBUTE TO A WORRISOME TREND IN PSYCHEDELICTHOUGHT—I ADMIT THAT I FEEL IT WITHIN MYSELF—TOWARD PREDICTIONS OF APOCALYPSE ORIMMINENT WORLD TRANSFORMATION. THIS MIGHT BE BECAUSE PSYCHEDELICS REVEAL SO MANYNEW POTENTIALITIES, CONVEY SO MANY DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND POSSIBLE LEVELS OFCONSCIOUS ACTIVITY, THAT THE HUMAN MIND AUTOMATICALLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSTRUCT ANESCHATOLOGICAL NARRATIVE FROM THE CHAOS. IN A SENSE, THE SIMPLEST NARRATIVEPROPOSES THAT OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION IS SPEEDING US DIZZILY TOWARDAN IMMINENT CONCLUSION OR CATACLYSM.UP UNTIL HIS DEATH FROM A BRAIN TUMOR IN APRIL 2000, MCKENNA WAS THE LEADINGPROPHET AND PROSELYTIZER, THE NONSTOP PONTIFICATOR, FOR THE CONTEMPORARYPSYCHEDELIC MOVEMENT. HE WRITES IN TRUE HALLUCINATIONS THAT AFTER DECADES OFPSILOCYBIN USE, “I HAD APPARENTLY EVOLVED INTO A SORT OF MOUTHPIECE FOR THEINCARNATE LOGOS. I COULD TALK TO SMALL GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BEELECTRIFYING EFFECT.” INDEED, MCKENNA’S VOICE WAS A PECULIARLY MEMORABLE BUZZSAW. THERE ARE TAPES OF HIM TALKING AT CONFERENCES, IN HIGH-SPEED NASALMONOTONE, FOR TWENTY OR MORE HOURS STRAIGHT.MCKENNA GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN COLORADO, THEN WENT TO BERKELEY IN THE 1960S,WHERE HE PARTICIPATED IN THE MOVEMENT, THE POLITICAL WING OF THE COUNTERCULTURE,AND SMOKED DMT FOR THE FIRST TIME. FROM BERKELEY, HE WENT TO LIVE IN THE FAREAST. IN NEPAL, HE SOUGHT OUT SHAMANS OF THE BON TRADITION, WHICH PREDATEDTIBETAN BUDDHISM, TRYING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SHAMANIC USE OF VISIONARYPLANTS. THE PURSUIT OF PSYCHEDELIA WAS, FOR HIM, A POLITICAL CHOICE: “WE HADSORTED THROUGH THE IDEOLOGICAL OPTIONS, AND WE HAD DECIDED TO PUT ALL OF OURCHIPS ON THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE AS THE SHORTEST PATH TO THE MILLENNIUM,WHICH OUR POLITICS HAD INFLAMED US TO HOPE FOR.” HE, HIS BROTHER DENNIS, AND AFEW FRIENDS DECIDED TO GO TO THE AMAZON IN PURSUIT OF A SNUFF MADE FROMDMT-CONTAINING PLANTS, USED BY LOCAL INDIANS. IN THE END, THEY NEVER BOTHEREDWITH THE SNUFF. INSTEAD, THEY BECAME INVOLVED IN A FEVERISH INVESTIGATION OFSTROPHARIA CUBENSIS, “ONE OF THE LARGEST, STRONGEST, AND CERTAINLY THE MOSTWIDELY DISTRIBUTED OF ANY OF THE KNOWN PSILOCYBIN-CONTAINING MUSHROOMS,” BUT,FOR REASONS THE MCKENNAS NEVER INVESTIGATED, NOT POPULAR WITH THE LOCALS.PSILOCYBIN BECAME THE CATALYST FOR MCKENNA’S ECCENTRIC CAREER. ALTHOUGH LEARY’SHARVARD PROJECT BEGAN WITH PSILOCYBIN, WHEN LSD APPEARED IN MASS QUANTITIES,PSILOCYBIN WAS ECLIPSED AND ALMOST FORGOTTEN BY THE COUNTERCULTURE. COMPARED TOLSD, PSILOCYBIN WAS A GOURMET PSYCHEDELIC IN THE 1960S, MUCH LESS AVAILABLE ANDRARELY SYNTHESIZED. IN FACT, MCKENNA AND HIS BROTHER WERE THE FIRST TO FIGUREOUT A RELIABLE METHOD FOR CULTIVATING PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOMS AT HOME. IN 1976,THEY PUBLISHED A LITTLE PAMPHLET ON THEIR TECHNIQUE USING THE SOBRIQUETS O. T.OSS AND O. N. OERIC. STILL IN PRINT, THE BOOKLET HAS SOLD OVER 100,000 COPIES.TRUE HALLUCINATIONS, MCKENNA’S ACCOUNT OF HIS 1971 AMAZONIAN ESCAPADE, IS ANEND-OF-THE-SIXTIES FABLE, A HAUNTED TALE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTACT ANDPSYCHEDELIC DELIRIUM, INCLUDING ZANY BLIPS OF TELEPATHY AND EVEN OMNISCIENCE.“ALCHEMY WAS THE GNOSIS OF MATERIAL TRANSFORMATION. CLUES SEEMED EVERYWHERE;EVERYTHING WAS WEBBED TOGETHER IN A MAGICAL FABRIC OF MEANING AND AFFIRMATIONAND MYSTERY.” THE MCKENNA BROTHERS BELIEVED THEIR MUSHROOM ALLY WASCOMMUNICATING WITH THEM, GIVING THEM HINTS ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD AND THEFUTURE OF THEIR SPECIES. AMONG THE THINGS THE MUSHROOM SEEMED TO BE TELLING THEMWAS THAT IT WAS AN ANCIENT EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE, A KIND OF PROBE SENTOUT TO HELP HUMANITY IN ITS EVOLUTION, OFFERING A SYMBOLIC PARTNERSHIP.“WE COULD FEEL THE PRESENCE OF SOME INVISIBLE HYPERSPATIAL ENTITY, AN ALLY,WHICH SEEMED TO BE OBSERVING AND SOMETIMES EXERTING INFLUENCE ON THE SITUATION,”MCKENNA LATER RECALLED ABOUT HIS YOUTHFUL EXPERIMENT. BECAUSE OF THE ALIEN NATURE OF THE TRYPTAMINE TRANCE, ITS SEEMING ACCENTUATIONOF THEMES ALIEN, INSECTILE, AND FUTURISTIC, AND BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCESWITH TRYPTAMINE IN WHICH INSECTILE HALLUCINATORY TRANSFORMATIONS OF HUMAN BEINGSWERE OBSERVED, WE WERE LED TO SPECULATE THAT THE ROLE OF THE PRESENCE WASSOMEHOW LIKE THAT OF AN ANTHROPOLOGIST, COME TO GIVE HUMANITY THE KEYS TOGALACTARIAN CITIZENSHIP. THE INCHOATE, OTHERWORLDLY VISIONS THAT FILLED THE AIR AT LA CHORERRA, THEINDIAN VILLAGE IN PERU WHERE THEY STAYED, WERE TOO MUCH TO COMPREHEND, AND TOOELABORATE TO ENCAPSULATE HERE, BUT THE SHADOW OF THOSE EARLY REVELATIONSINSPIRED THE MCKENNAS IN ALL THEIR FURTHER EXPLORATIONS.HAS HUMANITY BEEN CONTACTED BY ALIEN BEINGS? MCKENNA THOUGHT THE TYPICAL MODELOF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTACT—WIDE-EYED ALIENS DESCENDING TO EARTH IN A SHINYUFO—WAS TOO OVERTLY A PRODUCT OF OUR OWN TECHNOLOGICAL FANTASIES TO BE ACCURATE.OTHER UFO THEORISTS HAVE ALSO COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION IN THE LAST DECADES.SOME SUGGEST THAT THE UFOS AND THEIR CREWS ARE ACTUALLY TRAVELERS FROM OTHERDIMENSIONS, ANCIENT SPIRITUAL BEINGS CLOTHING THEMSELVES IN THE GARB OF MODERNFANTASY. THE WRITER MICHAEL TALBOT HAS SUGGESTED THAT UFO ENCOUNTERS ARE NEITHEROBJECTIVE NOR SUBJECTIVE, BUT “OMNIJECTIVE” PHENOMENA—A CONJUNCTION OF OBSERVERAND OBSERVED, IN THE SAME WAY A SUBATOMIC PARTICLE IS NEITHER WAVE NOR PARTICLE,BUT WHAT SOME PHYSICISTS HAVE DUBBED A “WAVICLE.” AN EASIER WAY FOR A HIGHLYADVANCED SPECIES TO DISSEMINATE ITSELF, MCKENNA SUSPECTED, WOULD BE THROUGHSPORES, THE HARDEST ORGANIC SUBSTANCE, DEPOSITED ON ASTEROIDS AND SENT SPINNINGTHROUGH THE GALAXY UNTIL THEY CRASH-LANDED ON SOME SUITABLE PLANET. TO SUPPORTTHIS WILD THEORY, HE NOTED THE PECULIAR SHAPE OF THE PSILOCYBIN MOLECULE. “IT ISTHE ONLY 4-SUBSTITUTED INDOLE KNOWN TO EXIST ON EARTH. . . . PSILOCYBIN HAS AUNIQUE CHEMICAL SIGNATURE THAT SAYS, ‘I AM ARTIFICIAL; I COME FROM OUTSIDE.’ ”THE CULT OF MCKENNA—AMONG RAVERS, HACKERS, AND SILICON VALLEY SOFTWAREENGINEERS—REMAINS AN IMPORTANT PHENOMENON. FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD A CURIOUSEFFECT ON ME. WHEN I DIDN’T LOOK AT HIS WORK FOR A WHILE, I RECALLED IT ASCARTOONLIKE, TRASHY, EXCESSIVELY ABSURD. BUT WHEN I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO HISBOOKS, I WAS CAPTIVATED, YET AGAIN, BY HIS STYLE, HIS SENSE OF HUMOR, AND THEFREEWHEELING FLOW OF HIS IDEAS. IN THAT WAY HIS WORK PARALLELS THE ENTIRESUBJECT OF PSYCHEDELICS, WHICH, WHEN YOU STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, SEEMS TO VANISHENTIRELY, YET AS SOON AS YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, EXPANDS UNTIL IT THREATENS TOTRANSFORM YOUR ENTIRE PERSPECTIVE ON REALITY.“THE POWER OF THE OTHER IS HUMBLING AND MAGNIFICENT, BUT BECAUSE IT CANNOT BEBENT INTO POWER IN THIS WORLD, PRIESTCRAFT TURNS AWAY FROM IT. IT IS THE ‘THROWNAWAY KNOWLEDGE’ OF THE LUIS SENYO INDIANS OF BAJA, CALIFORNIA. IT IS ONLY SEEINGAND KNOWING,” HE WROTE IN THE ARCHAIC REVIVAL. PART OF THE PLEASURE OF READINGMCKENNA IS THE RELIEF OF COMMUNING WITH A THINKER WITH NO ACADEMIC RUBRIC, NO AXTO GRIND OR FOUNDATION STIPEND TO PROTECT, WILLING TO TEE OFF ON ANY OF THETRANSCENDENT AND PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES OPENED TO HIS CAPACIOUS MIND BY THEMASSIVE, LONG-TERM INGESTING OF PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDS. AS MCKENNA SAID DURING ANINTERVIEW, “THE STRANGE THING ABOUT PSILOCYBIN, MY CAREER, AND THIS CONVERSATIONIS THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE EMPOWERMENT OF LANGUAGE. . . . THE SOCIALCONSEQUENCE OF THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE IS CLEAR THINKING—WHICH TRICKLES DOWNAS CLEAR SPEECH. EMPOWERED SPEECH.”MCKENNA HAPPILY ACCEPTED HIS MARGINALIZED STATUS BECAUSE HIS MODEL OFPSYCHEDELIC EXPLORATION WAS CLOSER TO HUXLEY’S THAN TO LEARY’S OR GINSBERG’S.THE ATTEMPT TO TRANSPORT LSD TO THE MASSES, USING THE MEDIA TO SPREAD THE WORD,LED TO SOCIAL CONFUSION AND POLITICAL BACKLASH. MCKENNA’S IDEA WAS THE OPPOSITE.HE ENCOURAGED THE DEEPER IMMERSION OF A SMALL SUBSET OF ALCHEMIST/ACOLYTES:“INSTEAD OF THE HORIZONTAL BROADENING OF THE FAITH, I WOULD BE MUCH MOREINTERESTED IN A VERTICAL STRENGTHENING OF THE FAITH BY HAVING THE PEOPLE WHOTAKE THESE COMPOUNDS TAKE MORE OF THEM, TAKE DIFFERENT ONES, AND TAKE LARGERDOSES. THE REAL CRUCIBLE OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE SELF.” HE DID NOT WANT TOINCITE THE GOVERNMENT TO FURTHER REPRESSION, AND HE PITCHED HIS IDEAS SO FARBEYOND THE PALE OF MAINSTREAM CONCERNS THAT THEY SEEMED COMPLETELYUNTHREATENING. MCKENNA CUNNINGLY CRAFTED HIS PUBLIC PERSONA AS CRAZY FOOL, THEIRISH RACONTEUR WITH A MAD GLEAM IN HIS EYES.I AM NOW IN A POSITION TO RECOGNIZE, AFTER VISITING THE PSYCHEDELIC ANTIPODESFOR MYSELF, THAT UNDERNEATH THE TEASING BANTER OF MCKENNA’S TALKS AND HIS TEXTSIS DEAD-SERIOUS INTENT, A TRULY RADICAL AND REAL VISION: “MY ASSUMPTION ABOUTPSYCHEDELICS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THE REASON THEY ARE NOT LEGAL IS NOT BECAUSEIT TROUBLES ANYONE THAT YOU HAVE VISIONS, BUT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THEMTHAT CASTS DOUBTS ON THE VALIDITY OF REALITY,” HE WROTE. “THEY ARE INEVITABLYDECONDITIONING AGENTS SIMPLY BY DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF A NEARBY REALITYRUNNING ON A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC. I THINK THEY ARE INHERENTLY CATALYSTS OFINTELLECTUAL DISSENT.”MCKENNA’S FOOD OF THE GODS IS AN OVERVIEW OF SACRED AND PROFANE DRUG USETHROUGHOUT HISTORY. LIKE WASSON, MCKENNA THOUGHT PSYCHEDELIC PLANTS MIGHT HAVECATALYZED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE ACQUISITION OFLANGUAGE. HE CALLS ADAM AND EVE’S EVICTION FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN FOR TASTINGTHE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL, “HISTORY’S FIRST DRUGBUST.” FOR HIM, THE MYTH SYMBOLICALLY DESCRIBES THE COLLAPSE OF HUMANITY’SSYMBIOTIC RELATION WITH A PSILOCYBIN-CONTAINING MUSHROOM IN AN ARCHAIC“PARTNERSHIP CULTURE” WHERE WOMEN CONTROLLED AGRICULTURE AND PLANT KNOWLEDGE.THIS COLLAPSE, FOR WHATEVER REASONS, LED TO THE MALE-AGGRESSION-RULED “DOMINATORCULTURE” WE KNOW TODAY: “SUBSTANCE-INDUCED CHANGES IN CONSCIOUSNESS DRAMATICALLYREVEAL THAT OUR MENTAL LIFE HAS PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS,” HE WRITES. “PSYCHOACTIVEDRUGS THUS CHALLENGE THE CHRISTIAN ASSUMPTION OF THE INVIOLABILITY AND SPECIALONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF THE SOUL. SIMILARLY, THEY CHALLENGE THE MODERN IDEA OF THEEGO AND ITS INVIOLABILITY AND CONTROL STRUCTURES. IN SHORT, ENCOUNTERS WITHPSYCHEDELIC PLANTS THROW INTO QUESTION THE ENTIRE WORLD VIEW OF THE DOMINATORCULTURE.”TO A GREAT EXTENT, HISTORY HAS BEEN PROPELLED BY THE QUEST FOR NEW TASTES ANDNEW PLEASURES. THE DRIVE TO SATISFY THE TASTE FOR NEW DELICACIES BROUGHT BACK BYEXPLORERS CREATED TRADE ROUTES, COLONIALISM, AND, IN THE MODERN ERA, THE REVIVALOF INSTITUTIONALIZED SLAVERY. “THE EARLY IMPORTATION OF AFRICAN SLAVE LABOR INTOTHE NEW WORLD WAS FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY, TO SUPPORT AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY BASEDON SUGAR.” REFINED SUGAR, HE NOTES, IS AN INESSENTIAL ADDITIVE AND A HIGHLYADDICTIVE DRUG. THE SUGAR ADDICT TENDS TOWARD A CHILDISH PERSONALITY, GIVEN TOTANTRUMS, DOMINATED BY MOOD SHIFTS. “THE CRAZE FOR SUGAR WAS SO OVERWHELMINGTHAT A THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIAN ETHICAL CONDITIONING MEANT NOTHING. ANOUTBREAK OF HUMAN CRUELTY AND BESTIALITY OF INCREDIBLE PROPORTIONS WAS BLANDLYACCEPTED BY THE INSTITUTIONS OF POLITE SOCIETY.” THE ENTRY OF SUGAR AND CAFFEINEINTO EUROPE LED TO THE COFFEEHOUSE CULTURE OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PARIS. THE“EXCESSIVE RAVING” STIMULATED BY STRONG CUPS OF ESPRESSO INCITED THE RADICALTHOUGHTS OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT PHILOSOPHES AND THE RADICAL DEEDS OF THE FRENCHREVOLUTIONARIES.ALCOHOL, FOR MCKENNA, IS THE “DOMINATOR DRUG PAR EXCELLENCE.” “NO OTHER DRUG HASHAD SUCH A PROLONGED DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS,” HE WRITES. “ALCOHOLAND SLAVERY OFTEN WENT HAND IN HAND ACROSS THE ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE. . . . A‘BESOTTED UNDERCLASS’ WAS A PERMANENT FIXTURE OF MERCANTILE SOCIETY WHETHER INTHE HOME COUNTRIES OR THE COLONIES.” THE OPPOSITE OF HALLUCINOGENIC OPENNESS,ALCOHOL LEADS TO A NARROWING OF CONSCIOUSNESS, A “CONDITION OF EGO OBSESSION ANDINABILITY TO RESIST THE DRIVE TOWARD IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION.” REPRESSION OFWOMEN, FRAT RAPES, AND WIFE BEATINGS ARE TYPICAL OUTCOMES OF THE ALCOHOLICLIFESTYLE. IN BOOZE LAND, MCKENNA SIGHS, “GONE ARE THE BOUNDARY-DISSOLVINGHALLUCINOGENIC ORGIES THAT DIMINISHED THE EGO OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND REASSERTEDTHE VALUES OF THE EXTENDED FAMILY AND THE TRIBE.”THROUGHOUT HISTORY, DIFFERENT CIVILIZATIONS DEVELOPED A TRANS-SPECIES BOND WITHA PARTICULAR ENTHEOGENIC PLANT. THE EARLY VEDIC CIVILIZATION HAD SOMA; THEANCIENT GREEKS HAD SOME FORM OF ERGOT OR PERHAPS SEVERAL PSYCHOACTIVE CATALYSTSUSED IN THE DURABLE ELEUSIAN MYSTERIES, FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS THE ESSENTIALINITIATION RITUAL OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. IN EVERY CASE, THE CONNECTION WASEVENTUALLY BROKEN—EITHER CHANGES IN CLIMATE LED TO DISAPPEARANCE OF THE CHEMICALCATALYST, OR A SELF-PERPETUATING RULING CLASS OR PRIESTHOOD ESTABLISHED ITSPOWER BY GUARDING, THEN CONCEALING, AND ULTIMATELY FORGETTING THE MYSTERY. THECOMPULSIVE MODERN QUEST FOR NEW TASTES AND ARTIFICIAL PLEASURES, RANGING FROMSUGAR TO OXYCONTIN, HAS BEEN AN UNCONSCIOUS EFFORT TO RECAPTURE THE LOSTCATALYST: “EACH INTOXICANT, EACH EFFORT TO RECAPTURE THE SYMBIOTIC BALANCE OFTHE HUMAN-MUSHROOM RELATIONSHIP IN THE LOST AFRICAN EDEN, IS A PALER, MOREDISTORTED IMAGE OF THE ORIGINAL MYSTERY THAN THE LAST.”ONE PROBLEM WITH MCKENNA’S THESIS IN FOOD OF THE GODS IS THAT THE MAYAN ANDAZTECS, HIGHLY ADVANCED CIVILIZATIONS THAT INCORPORATED USE OF PSYCHEDELICS, ATLEAST AMONG THE PRIEST CLASS, WERE NOT EXACTLY MODELS OF ENLIGHTENED BEHAVIOR.HUMAN SACRIFICE WAS THEIR FAVORITE FORM OF POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT. CLEARLY, THEUSE OF PSYCHEDELIC SACRAMENTS DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE CREATION OF AFEMININE-ORIENTED PARTNERSHIP SOCIETY WITH A PENCHANT FOR BOUNDARY-DISSOLVINGORGIES. INSTEAD, IT CAN LEAD TO THE ATTEMPT TO MATCH THE VOLATILE POWER ANDAMBIGUOUS SPECTACLES OF THE HALLUCINATORY REALMS WITH BLOODY AND HORRIBLE ACTSOF APPEASEMENT. THE PSYCHEDELIC IMPULSE CAN BECOME DANGEROUS AND DECADENT.MCKENNA MAKES A LAUDATORY EFFORT TO PUT A HAPPY FACE ON MATERIAL THAT MAY BEAMBIGUOUS AT ITS CORE, BUT PSYCHEDELIC RELATIVISM, AT THE VERY LEAST, REVEALSASPECTS OF REALITY DENIED BY MAINSTREAM MATERIALISM.THE POSTSIXTIES PSYCHEDELICS AVATARS, MCKENNA AMONG THEM, BELIEVE THATPSYCHEDELICS ARE A FAST-TRACK METHOD FOR REVEALING THE DARK MATTER OFCONSCIOUSNESS, A NECESSARY ANTIDOTE TO THE “DOMINATOR CULTURE” OF MATERIALISM:“LIKE A CHEMICAL HABIT, WE ARE HOOKED ON EGO. AND THE PSYCHEDELIC DISSOLVES THATCHEMICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPENDENCY AND REPLACES IT WITH THE FACTS OF THEMATTER: HOW THE INDIVIDUAL FITS INTO THE LIFE AND ORGANIZATION OF THIS PLANET,THE VAST AMOUNT OF TIME ALL THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE AND HAVE WORKEDTHEMSELVES TO THEIR PRESENT STATUS.” ESSENTIALLY, I AGREE, ALTHOUGH THE WORLDSREVEALED THROUGH PSYCHEDELICS HAVE THEIR OWN VALENCES, THEIR OWN TROUBLINGAMBIGUITIES.. . .I TOOK A SWIM IN THE MAYAN QUEENS’ BATHS, A WATERFALL SPLASHING INTO A NATURALCOVE SURROUNDED BY LIMESTONE CLIFFS. THE ROCKS AROUND THIS POOL LOOK MORE LIKETHE FACES OF IMPRISONED GODS, IMPASSIVE ELDERS, WATER CASCADING OVER THEIRFROWNING FEATURES, THAN ANY ROCKS I HAVE SEEN. AS I SWAM, I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS:IF THE INDIANS, NORTH AND SOUTH, WERE RIGHT ABOUT SO MUCH—ABOUT THE NATURE OFSPIRITUAL REALITY, ABOUT ALL THAT WE IN THE MODERN WEST HAVE FORFEITED ANDFORGOTTEN—THEN PERHAPS THE MOST HEAVY-DUTY INDIAN PROPHECIES NEED TO BE TAKENSERIOUSLY. THE HOPI INDIANS IN THE SOUTHWEST, PERHAPS THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTSOF AMERICA, HAVE INHERITED A SERIES OF ANCIENT PREDICTIONS. THE HOPI SEERSDESCRIBED A “GOURD OF ASHES” FALLING FROM THE SKY, DESTROYING A CITY, A PROPHECYSEEMINGLY CONFIRMED BY HIROSHIMA. THE PROBABLE GIST OF THE NEAR-FUTURE,ACCORDING TO THE HOPIS, IS GRIM, TO SAY THE LEAST: FURTHER ENVIRONMENTALDEVASTATION; MULTIPLE ASSASSINATIONS OF WORLD LEADERS; NUCLEAR WAR (“A SPIRITUALCONFLICT WITH MATERIAL MATTERS”) STARTED BY INDIA, CHINA, OR PAKISTAN; THEUNITED STATES DESTROYED BEFORE THE NEXT WORLD CYCLE BEGINS.OUT OF THE NATURAL STONE BOWLS OF THE QUEENS’ BATH, I DRIED MYSELF AND WALKEDTHE PATH BETWEEN ANCIENT RUINED TEMPLES AND TWISTING TREES, THE SUNLIGHT FALLINGTO THE EARTH THROUGH THE BRANCHES IN GOSSAMER STRANDS. HOWLER MONKEYS CHATTEREDAND WHOOPED OVERHEAD. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON IN PALENQUE. THAT NIGHT, IDECIDED, IF POSSIBLE, I WOULD TRY DMT."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33I SMOKED DMTANY PLACE IS THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.—BLACK ELK, BLACK ELK SPEAKS[images/00006.jpg] AND I DID SO.IT WAS PAST THREE A.M. AT THE CHAN KAH HOTEL IN PALENQUE. I WAS WITH JOHN ANDSARA, TWO ATTENDANTS AT THE CONFERENCE. I HELD THE LONG GLASS PIPE TO MY LIPS,WATCHED AS THE SMALL BEIGE CLUMPS BEGAN TO RELEASE THEMSELVES INTO THE AIR. IINHALED—ONE, TWO, THREE BREATHS. THE DRY SMOKE WAS WICKEDLY NOXIOUS AND BIZARRE,WITH AN EXTRATERRESTIAL PLASTIC TANG. AS I HAD BEEN WARNED, IT WAS LIKE SMOKINGA SHARD OF LAWN FURNITURE. WITH THE NEXT INTAKE, THE UNFOLDING, THE UNVEILING,BEGAN. RUNES AND GEOMETRIC PATTERNS FILLED THE AIR, HOVERED AROUND ME, TATTOOEDTHEMSELVES OVER THE WALLS, THE FURNITURE, THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. THESEIMAGES WERE COPPER- OR GOLDEN-COLORED AND I HAD ONLY A FEW SECONDS TO LOOK ATTHEM. IN THOSE FEW SECONDS I SAW AN INTRICATE INTERWEAVE OF SACRED GEOMETRICALMOTIFS—PENTAGRAMS, SEALS AND SYMBOLS, GOLDEN TRIANGLES—DRAWN FROM EVERY MYSTICALAND TRADITIONAL SOURCE. AS I WAS SUCKED INTO THE GOLDEN FUNNEL IT SEEMEDSTARTLINGLY CLEAR THAT ALL OF THOSE SYMBOL SYSTEMS WERE NOT JUST METAPHORICALCODES BUT ACTUAL GATEWAYS TO LITERAL DIMENSIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN. JOHN, AVIDEO ART STUDENT FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND DMT VETERAN, HAD DESCRIBED THESEPATTERNS AS THE ENTRY POINT—ONCE YOU SAW THEM, YOU WERE JUST ONE BREATH AWAY.I’M GOING TO GET THERE, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, SURPRISED, EVEN SHOCKED. I TOOK INONE MORE DEEP PLASTICKY BREATH AND HELD IT, AND I STARTED TO GO. JOHN TOOK THEPIPE FROM MY HAND. I FELL BACK ON THE MATTRESS AS I SHOT OUT OF MYSELF LIKE AROCKET.HOW TO EXPLAIN THE RUSH, THE TERRIFYING AND ECSTATIC TRAUMA, OF LEAVING YOURBODY, AND YOUR BRAIN, AND EVERYTHING THAT IS YOU, EXCEPT SOME INFINITESIMALTENDRIL THAT HAS NO EXISTENCE IN SPACE OR DURATION IN TIME, WHICH IS AN ASTRALPROBE SPIRALING OUT INTO THE INFINITE, FAR BEYOND THE SHELL YOU LEFT BEHIND?I SEEMED TO BE PROJECTING FORWARD AT AN INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT THE PERIPHERY OF MYVISION I SAW TWISTING WHITE COLUMNS LIKE HIGH-TECH SWIZZLE STICKS, AS IF I WASFOLLOWING A LADDER OR LATTICE UP, OR IN OR OUT OR ALL OF THE ABOVE, TOHYPERSPACE. I HAD THE SENSE OF FLOATING THROUGH A FRACTAL TAPESTRY, A CURVINGAND INFOLDING PLANE OF SYNTHETIC, PLASTIC, FANTASTIC WHITENESS AND GLEAMINGCOLORS IN ENDLESS VIBRANT HUES. THIS EXTRADIMENSIONAL REALM I HAD PITCHED INTOWAS MADE, I FELT CERTAIN, OF DATA, OF QUANTUM EQUATIONS, VISIBLE SHAMANICHARMONICS, AND THE SELF-WEAVING FABRIC OF EXTRADIMENSIONAL SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS.IT WAS SCIENCE FICTION MADE FACT. A DIMENSION DEVOID OF NATURAL THINGS, OFPLANTS AND HUMAN NEED, OF OUR WEAK AND IMPRECISE SYMBOL SYSTEMS. DMT LAND WAS ANINTERWEAVE OF TANTRIC MANDALAS, VIRTUAL REALITY FANTASIAS, STAINED-GLASSAUREOLAE; A TEN-DIMENSIONAL WALT DISNEY WORLD PROJECTED INTO SOME FAR-FETCHEDAND FAR-FLUNG FUTURE. THERE WAS, IN THAT PLACE, RUSHING TOWARD ME, ANOVERWHELMING FORCE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SENTIENCE. I KNEW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT MYMIND, ON ANY LEVEL, HAD CREATED WHAT I WAS SEEING. THIS WAS NO MENTALPROJECTION. THIS WAS NOT A STRUCTURE WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT THE DRUG HAD SOMEHOWTAPPED INTO. IT WAS A NONHUMAN REALITY EXISTING AT A DEEPER LEVEL THAN THEPHYSICAL WORLD.SUDDENLY I WAS ROCKETING THROUGH THEIR CITIES. MULTIDIMENSIONAL, JEWEL-FACETED,HARD AND IMMATERIAL PALACES WHERE GEOMETRICAL AND TENTACULAR CONSTRUCTIONS WEREBEING TAKEN APART AND RECONSTRUCTED AT SUCH LIGHTNING SPEED THAT I CANNOT RECALLMORE THAN A TINY AND TRIVIAL FRACTION. I WAS TAKEN ON A FLYBY AT A TREMENDOUSVELOCITY. THERE WERE BEINGS IN THIS PLACE. THEY WERE HUMANOID, AS FAR AS I CANREMEMBER, WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT FAR ENOUGH. I RECALL A BLUE ENTITY (A BLUETHE COLOR OF CERTAIN CELESTIAL BUDDHAS IN TIBETAN THANGKA PAINTINGS),GESTURING—IN MY MEMORY I SEE HIM WITH ONE HAND RAISED, WAVING AT ME. THERE WEREFOUNTAINS AND SPINNING MANDALAS LIKE LIT-UP ROULETTE WHEELS OR FLOWERING CHAKRASTHAT SEEMED ORGANIC AS WELL AS MECHANICAL. AT THE CENTER OF THE CITY THERE WAS AGREAT FOUNTAIN, LIKE THE FOUNTAIN AT THE CENTER OF A RENAISSANCE TOWN SQUARE,WHERE BITS OF DATA OR PERHAPS MATHEMATICAL POTENTIALITIES OR BURBLING NEW TESTTUBE UNIVERSES WERE FLOWING IN RAINBOW PATTERNS OF ULTRAVIOLET FROTH. THIS REALMWAS IN A STATE OF CONTINUAL TRANSFORMATION, YET SOLIDIFIED IN SYNTHETIC MATTER.EVERYTHING I “SAW” GLITTERED WITH AN ARTIFICIAL SPARKLE. THERE WAS SOMETHINGIMPERSONAL, DETACHED, ABOUT MY VISIT. IT SEEMED AS IF THE ENTITIES WERETRANQUIL, EVEN UNEMOTIVE, AS THEY WENT ABOUT THEIR WORK OF COSMIC SUPERVISION.EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE COMMUNICATING TO ME A CHATTERING GREETING. ALTHOUGH ICAN’T REMEMBER SOUND, I FELT THERE WAS SOUND ALL AROUND ME. WEEKS LATER I BEGANTO RECOLLECT IT AS HIGH-FREQUENCY BUZZING, CLICKS, AND TRILLS. AS I RECALL, THEBEINGS IN THE DMT UNIVERSE WERE SAYING TO ME, OVER AND OVER AGAIN:“THIS IS IT. NOW YOU KNOW. THIS IS IT. NOW YOU KNOW.”I BEGAN TO REMEMBER THAT I HAD A BODY, ALTHOUGH IT WAS LOST TO ME. I FELT MYSELFBREATHING. EVERY NOW AND THEN I WOULD SWALLOW INVOLUNTARILY. MY BREATHING AND MYSWALLOWING SEEMED LIKE A PROGRAM THEY WERE RUNNING. “I” SEEMED TO BE EXACTLYLIKE A PROGRAM THEY WERE RUNNING IN THEIR FABULOUSLY IMPERSONAL COSMOLOGICALSYSTEM: AS I BREATHED, THEY WERE BREATHING ME.“NOW YOU KNOW. THIS IS IT. NOW GO BACK. NOW GO BACK. NOW YOU KNOW. THIS IS IT.NOW GET OUT.”AS SOON AS I RECALLED MY HUMAN IDENTITY, I WAS FLOWING BACK INTO THIS WORLD. INOTICED THERE WAS SOMETHING . . . A ROOM CONTAINING ME. I WAS LYING STRETCHED ONA HOTEL BED. THEN THE ENGULFMENT QUICKLY RECEDED, RETURNED TO MORPHING GEOMETRICGOLD FORMS THAT SPUN DOWN, QUICKLY WHIRLING OUT OF EXISTENCE AS I RETURNED TOWHO I HAD BEEN.I WAS LEFT WITH LITTLE DOUBT THAT I HAD VISITED WHAT WE, FOR LACK OF A MOREACCURATE WORD, TRADITIONALLY CALL “SPIRITUAL REALITY.” THE TRIP SUPPORTED THEIDEA OF A SOUL EXISTING OUTSIDE THE BODY, WOVEN INTO THE EXTRADIMENSIONAL FABRICOF THE COSMOS. THE COSMOS, WHAT MCKENNA CALLED THE “COSMIC GIGGLE,” IS SOMETHINGTHEY WERE SPINNING, OR WE WERE SPINNING WITH THEM. I HAD BEEN GIVEN MORE THAN IEVER EXPECTED. I HAD BEEN SHOWN THE HARD KERNEL OF EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TOKNOW.THE DMT REALM IS “NEXT DOOR,” BEHIND EVERY BILLOWING CURTAIN, HIDDEN INSIDE THEDARK MATTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS, NOW PLAYING EVERY NIGHT IN DISGUISED FORM IN OURDREAMS. IT IS SO CLOSE TO US, ADJACENT OR PERPENDICULAR TO THIS REALITY. IT IS ASOFT SHADOW, A CANDLE FLICKER, AWAY.DMT IS DIRECT MYSTICAL TRANSMISSION. DRASTIC MAGICAL TRANSPORT. IT IS, ASMCKENNA PUT IT, JUST TOO MUCH. ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE, YOU AREPERMANENTLY REWIRED. YOU CAN CONSIGN EXISTENTIALISM TO THE SCRAPHEAP AS YOU WRAPYOUR OLD ONTOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTS AROUND THIS NEW POLE. OF COURSE, MANY QUESTIONSARE OPENED BY THE JOLT, WHILE ONLY A FEW ARE ANSWERED. FOR ME, THE DMT VISIONSUGGESTS THAT WE ARE INCARNATIONS IN SOME WAY, SENT FROM THAT PLACE OFBOUNDLESSNESS TO THIS ONE OF STICKS AND STONES AND HARD KNOCKS, PERHAPS OVER THECOURSE OF LIVES PING-PONGING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE DIMENSIONS WITH CERTAINTASKS TO PERFORM, OR WITH KNOWLEDGE TO LEARN. OR PERHAPS WHAT IS HAPPENING ISMORE AMBIGUOUS AND MULTIPURPOSED THAN WE CAN LANGUAGE.THE EXPERIENCE CALLED TO MIND MIRCEA ELIADE’S BOOK THE ETERNAL RETURN, IN WHICHHE ANALYZES THE CONSISTENT BELIEF HELD BY ARCHAIC CULTURES THAT ALL PLACES INPHYSICAL REALITY HAVE A DOUBLE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD. EVERY TEMPLE AND CITY BUILTBY HUMAN BEINGS ACTUALLY RELATES TO A “CELESTIAL ARCHETYPE.” ELIADE WRITES: “NOTONLY DOES A MODEL PRECEDE TERRESTRIAL ARCHITECTURE, BUT THE MODEL IS ALSOSITUATED IN AN IDEAL (CELESTIAL) REGION OF ETERNITY.” THE DMT CITY SEEMED TO BESOMETHING LIKE A CELESTIAL METROPOLIS, A FABULOUS IDEAL THAT OUR PHYSICAL CITIESARE A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO IMITATE, UTILIZING BLUNT MATTER RATHER THAN BRIGHTMAGIC.FOR MANY PEOPLE, AYAHUASCA—A SLOWED-DOWN LOW-RES INTERFACE OF THE DMTFLASH—SEEMS TO CONVEY STRONG MESSAGES FROM THE NATURAL WORLD, OF NATURE ASSENTIENT ENERGY AND SPIRIT MATTER, OF THE NEED TO PROTECT THE PLANET WE HAVEBEEN GIVEN. YAGÉ WHISPERS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE MEANT TO BE GARDENERS OF THISREALITY, JOURNEYERS, STORYTELLERS AND SINGERS, WEAVERS OF THE SACRED. DMT, ONTHE OTHER HAND, CONVEYS NO OVERT HUMAN OR HUMANE MESSAGE. IT IS A DOORWAY YOUCAN STEP THROUGH TO GREET THE BEINGS WHO RUN THE COSMIC CANDY STORE. SPINNINGDOWN FROM THE IMMERSIVE MATRICES OF DMT, I SUSPECTED THOSE BEINGS WERE, IN SOMEWAY OR OTHER, SUPERCONSCIOUS ENTITIES WHO CREATED AND MAINTAIN OUR UNIVERSE.THEY MADE US FOR SOME PURPOSE, TO PLAY WITH US OR TO BE US, TO TANTALIZE ORTEACH US. BUT OF COURSE THIS RAISES ONLY MORE QUESTIONS: WHO CREATED THEM? ISTHAT THE ONLY OTHER DIMENSION OUT THERE? IF NOT, WHAT OTHER DIMENSIONS, WHATOTHER FORCES, ARE ACTING UPON US OR SEEKING TO COMMUNICATE WITH US?I WAS LEFT WITH THE NOTION THAT CREATIVITY IS ONE PURPOSE OF EXISTENCE; WE AREMEANT TO EVOLVE TOWARD THEM, BECOME LIKE THAT, ENTITIES BEYOND THE PHYSICALPLANE, AND MAKE UNIVERSES, PALACES OF THOUGHT, GNOSTIC HIEROGLYPHS OF OUR OWN,AS THEY MADE THIS ONE. BUILDING ANOTHER UNIVERSE—IT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE ACT OFCREATIVITY WE COULD IMAGINE. BUT PERHAPS IT IS JUST ONE OF THEIR PARLOR TRICKS.BEYOND ALL OF THIS, I MULLED OVER THE OLD LITANY OF QUESTIONS ANYBODY WOULD WANTTO ASK THE SPIRITS, IF THEY COULD: WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING DOWN HERE? IS THIS LIFEA TEST IN SOME WAY? WHY ARE WE, SO OFTEN, SO FORSAKEN? AND WHY IS THE DMTDIMENSION SO SYNTHETIC, AS IF IT WERE BUILT OUT OF MATHEMATICS AND MACHINELOGIC, OUT OF LANGUAGE EVOLVED TO SOME ECSTATIC EQUATION? ARE THOSE BEINGS LIKEUS, IN SOME WAY, BUT PERFECTED TO A POINT WHERE THEY DREAM-ENGINEERED THEMSELVESOUT OF THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM? ARE THEY, PERHAPS, OURSELVES, EVOLVED TO APOINT OF DISEMBODIED IMMORTALITY, HAVING LEARNED TO BEND AND SNAP THE TIME-SPACECONTINUUM LIKE A TWIG? ARE THEY OURSELVES SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF WHERE WE ARE NOWTHAT THEY CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH US IN ORTHOGONAL FASHION, THE WAY ATHREE-DIMENSIONAL BEING MIGHT TRY TO EXPRESS ITSELF TO A TWO-DIMENSIONAL DWELLEROF FLATLAND IN A LANGUAGE OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE DOTS AND LINES? AM I, ARE YOU,JUST A PROGRAM RUNNING IN SOME ALIEN SUPERCOMPUTER? IS THAT WHAT THIS UNIVERSEIS?WE HAVE THE DMT RECEPTOR. IT IS A TRIGGER PLACED IN OUR BRAIN TO LAUNCH US OUTTHERE—TRY TO GET USED TO THE IDEA. IT IS THERE SO WE CAN COMMUNE WITH THAT (ORWITH IT, OR WITH THEM, WHATEVER)—A TRIP THAT WILL EVENTUALLY FORCE US TO REVISEOUR SCIENCE TEXTS AND REWIRE OUR WAY OF CONCEIVING REALITY. WHY HAS THISEXPERIENCE BEEN ALLOWED TO EMERGE INTO THE MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS AT THIS PRECISETIME? TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, WHY AM I THE FIRST, AFTER UNTOLD NUMBERS OFDREAMING ANCESTORS, TO RETURN TO THIS STARTLING SOURCE? AS TECHNOLOGY TURNSEVER-MORE TREACHEROUS AND OUR WEATHER GETS WEIRDER, I SUSPECT THERE ISINTENTIONALITY TO IT.DMT FLASHES THE QUESTION OF FREE WILL: IS THERE ANY SUCH THING? I STILL SUSPECTTHERE IS—HOWEVER MUCH SPIRITUAL HIERARCHIES ARE RUNNING THIS SHOW, EACH OF USCAN CHOOSE TO CREATE OUR ROLE IN IT WITH THE THEATER PROPS LYING AROUND THISQUAINT LITTLE PLANET. THERE MAY SIMULTANEOUSLY BE FREE WILL AND A KNOWING OFEVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AND CAN HAPPEN; ALL KINDS OF PARADOXES MAY COEXIST INTHOSE QUANTUM INTERSTICES, THOSE TINY CURLED-UP DIMENSIONS OF VIBRATINGSUPERSTRINGS THAT PHYSICISTS FOUND, TO THEIR OWN SURPRISE, HIDDEN WITHIN THISONE. WITH DMT, ONCE WE KNOW IT IS THERE, WE ARE LEFT WITH A CHOICE THAT ISITSELF A CLASSIC TEST OF FREE WILL: ALL OF US CAN CHOOSE TO GO THERE, PUSH TOACTIVATE THE CIRCUITS THAT GIVE US ACCESS TO THAT IMPACTED LABYRINTH. OR WE CANAVOID IT, CUT OURSELVES OFF, DENY ITS EXISTENCE OUT OF A COMPLETELY SENSIBLECOWARDICE. PERSONALLY, I DON’T THINK THE PURE DMT FLASH IS A JOURNEY WE SHOULDTAKE TOO MANY TIMES; IT FEELS INTUITIVELY THREATENING. BUT CERTAINLY WE AREMEANT TO GO SEE FOR OURSELVES, AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE. THE FACT IS THAT THEPORTAL EXISTS. NOT TO EXPLORE IT WOULD MEAN DENYING OUR HERITAGE OF HUMANCURIOSITY.. . .I WENT OUTSIDE, A SMALL SMIDGEN OF SELF STUFFED INTO FLESH, STARING UP AT THESPINNING, CHORTLING STARS, FEELING A MIXTURE OF ASTONISHMENT AND TERROR. WELL,THAT WAS AMAZING, I THOUGHT. INCREDIBLE. I AM SO GRATEFUL, SO GRATEFUL. THANKGOD I NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.WHEN I RETURNED, SARA WAS ALREADY DOWN AND SHE WAS WEEPING. “I WAS FIGHTING ITAT FIRST,” SHE SAID. BUT THE DMT BEINGS HAD COME TO HER, IN THE TREACLYTRADITION OF HOLLYWOOD, WITH OPEN ARMS OF LOVE. THEY TOLD HER THERE WAS NOREASON TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM. “THEY SHOWED ME MY PALM AND MY ASTROLOGICALCHART,” SHE SAID. “THEY SAID I HAD BEEN SENT INTO THE WORLD FOR A PURPOSE.” IADMIT THAT I WAS JEALOUS OF THE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN SHOWERED ON SARA BY THE DMTBEINGS, WHO SEEMED TO REGARD ME WITH A MORE AMBIGUOUS DETACHMENT.TEN MINUTES LATER, JOHN SMOKED THE GLASS PIPE, FELL BACK, AND WENT OUT. HE CAMEDOWN SCREAMING “WE ARE! WE ARE!” OVER AND OVER AGAIN, UNTIL THE LIGHTS IN OTHERHOTEL ROOMS FLICKED ON. A BEING HAD SHOWN HIM ITS WHIRRING PRAYING MANTIS LEGS,HE SAID. HE SAW A FEMALE ENTITY SITTING AT SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE ACOMPUTER. HE TOLD US HOW HE HAD SET FREE A PRAYING MANTIS WHEN HE WAS FIVE. THEPRAYING MANTIS HAD TURNED TO LOOK BACK AT HIM BEFORE IT HOPPED AWAY, AND AT THATMOMENT HE KNEW, WITH COMPLETE AND UTTER CERTAINTY.HE KNEW THAT THE MANTIS KNEW HIM."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34DIRECT MYSTICALTRANSMISSION[images/00006.jpg] DMT WAS NOT A POPULAR OR WELL-KNOWN DRUG IN THE 1950S AND1960S. ALTHOUGH IT WAS AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCLES, ITS OVERWHELMING SPEEDINGCAR CRASH EFFECT WAS NOT TO MOST PEOPLE’S TASTE. AS I WAS WRITING THIS, I MET ANARTIST WHO WAS A TEENAGER IN THE EARLY 1960S. SHE TRIED DMT AT THAT TIME ANDFOUND IT TERRIFYING. SHE REFUSED TO DESCRIBE HER EXPERIENCE TO ME AND BLANCHEDAT THE DISTANT MEMORY; HOWEVER, SHE NOTED THAT IT WAS THE LAST PSYCHEDELIC SHEEVER TOOK. JUST AS THE REVELATIONS OF MESCALINE WERE TOO TRAUMATIC AND STRANGEFOR THE BOURGEOIS INTELLECTUALS OF THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, MOST OF THEPSYCHEDELIC EXPLORERS OF THE 1950S AND 1960S COULD NOT HANDLE DMT. IT IS ONLY INTHE LAST TWO DECADES THAT IT HAS ATTAINED CULT STATUS, AND ITS GYROSCOPICEFFECTS ARE IMPACTING CERTAIN TYPES OF MUSIC, VIDEO GAMES, AND MOVIES. ATBURNING MAN, I WAS SURPRISED WHEN A RAVER, A KID IN HIS EARLY TWENTIES WEARINGWIDE FURRY PANTS, TOLD ME, “WHEN I FIRST SMOKED DMT, IT WAS LIKE COMING HOME.”ARE KIDS TODAY BEING PRIMED FOR THE DMT FLASH BY THEIR OVEREXPOSURE TO THESENSORIAL CULTURE OF SHOCK THAT SURROUNDS THEM—THE VIOLENT TOTALITY OF DMTTRANSPORT SOMETHING LIKE THE TOY SURPRISE INSIDE THE MASS MEDIA’S HALLUCINATORYCRACKERJACK BOX? AS WALTER BENJAMIN ONCE NOTED, “MAN’S NEED TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TOSHOCK EFFECTS IS HIS ADJUSTMENT TO THE DANGERS THREATENING HIM.”DMT IS MIND EXPANSION AS SHOCK THERAPY, AND MCKENNA HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ITSREVIVAL: “THE DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE MOLECULE HAS THE UNIQUE PROPERTY OF RELEASINGTHE STRUCTURED EGO INTO THE OVERSELF. EACH PERSON WHO HAS THAT EXPERIENCEUNDERGOES A MINI-APOCALYPSE, A MINI-ENTRY AND MAPPING INTO HYPERSPACE,” HEWROTE. “FOR SOCIETY TO FOCUS IN THIS DIRECTION, NOTHING IS NECESSARY EXCEPT FORTHIS EXPERIENCE TO BECOME AN OBJECT OF GENERAL CONCERN.”ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE PALENQUE CONFERENCE SAID HE THOUGHT THE BEST USEFOR DMT WAS TO “CONVINCE THE DOUBTERS,” AND INDEED, THE UNADULTERATED DMT TRIPSEEMS TO REVEAL THAT THE COSMOS IS A FAR MORE POPULOUS PLACE THAN WE IMAGINE. TOQUOTE MCKENNA AGAIN: “AND WHAT IS THE DIMENSION BEYOND LIFE AS ILLUMINATED BYDMT? IF WE CAN TRUST OUR OWN PERCEPTIONS, THEN IT IS A PLACE IN WHICH THRIVES ANECOLOGY OF SOULS WHOSE STUFF OF BEING IS MORE SYNTACTICAL THAN MATERIAL. ITSEEMS TO BE A NEARBY REALM INHABITED BY ETERNAL ELFIN ENTELOCHIES MADE ENTIRELYOF INFORMATION AND JOYOUS SELF-EXPRESSION. THE AFTERLIFE IS MORE CELTICFAIRYLAND THAN EXISTENTIAL NONENTITY; AT LEAST THAT IS THE EVIDENCE OF THE DMTEXPERIENCE.”AS THE MONOLITHIC CORPORATE CULTURE THREATENS TO CLOSE OVER OUR HEAD LIKE ACOFFIN LID, DMT CAN PROVIDE, FOR WESTERN SEARCHERS, WHAT PEYOTE DID FOR THEINDIANS: INSTANT PROOF, BEYOND ANY DOUBT, OF THE EXISTENCE OF A NONMATERIALISTMYSTERY WORTH EXPLORING.IN 1990 THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY APPROVED A CLINICAL STUDY OF DMT’S EFFECT ONHUMAN SUBJECTS. CONDUCTED BY DR. RICK STRASSMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,THE STUDY WAS THE FIRST RESEARCH ON HUMAN RESPONSE TO A PSYCHEDELIC DRUGAPPROVED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. OVER FIVE YEARS, STRASSMAN, A PSYCHIATRIST,GAVE REPEATED INTRAVENOUS INJECTIONS OF DMT, IN INCREASING DOSAGES, TO SIXTYSUBJECTS, STUDYING THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO THE DRUG,UNTIL HE DISCONTINUED THE PROJECT IN 1995. ALTHOUGH INTERESTED IN DMT’SPOTENTIAL USE IN THERAPY, HE ALSO HAD A SECRET AGENDA.“I FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS A SPIRIT MOLECULE SOMEWHERE IN THE BRAIN,INITIATING OR SUPPORTING MYSTICAL AND OTHER NATURALLY OCCURRING ALTERED STATESOF CONSCIOUSNESS,” WRITES STRASSMAN IN DMT: THE SPIRIT MOLECULE, HIS BOOK ON THESTUDY. BEFORE DMT, HE INVESTIGATED MELATONIN. DISCOVERED IN 1958, MELATONIN IS AHORMONE THAT CONTROLS OUR REACTION TO LIGHT AND DARKNESS, AND HAS A FUNCTION INSLEEP. PRODUCED IN THE PINEAL GLAND, IT IS VERY SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE TO DMT ANDSEROTONIN. AFTER EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF MELATONIN PROVED DISAPPOINTING—EVEN ATHIGH DOSES IT HAD NO PSYCHICALLY TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT—HE TURNED TO DMT AS APRIME CANDIDATE.DMT WAS FIRST SYNTHESIZED, BUT UNTESTED AND SHELVED, IN A CANADIAN LABORATORY IN1931. IN THE LATE 1940S, IT WAS FOUND TO BE A NATURALLY OCCURRING ALKALOID INVARIOUS PLANTS AND AMAZONIAN SNUFFS. IN THE 1950S, DMT’S EFFECTS WERE STUDIED ONHUNDREDS OF HUMAN SUBJECTS IN HUNGARY BY DR. STEPHEN SZARA. DURING THE POSTWARYEARS THE PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSION CONSIDERED DMT, LIKE LSD, PRIMARILY INTERESTINGAS A “PSYCHOTOMIMETIC,” A COMPOUND IMITATING THE EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSIS. ANOTHERDISCOVERY WAS MADE ABOUT DMT: “IN 1972, NOBEL PRIZE–WINNING SCIENTIST JULIUSAXELROD OF THE U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH REPORTED FINDING IT IN HUMANBRAIN TISSUE. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH SHOWED THAT DMT COULD ALSO BE FOUND IN HUMANURINE AND THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID BATHING THE BRAIN.” IN OTHER WORDS, DMT WAS ANENDOGENOUS COMPOUND, PRODUCED BY THE BRAIN FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. AFTERPSYCHEDELICS WERE LEGALLY “RESTRICTED” IN 1970, ALL STUDIES OF DMT STOPPED. (AQUESTION WORTH ASKING: SHOULD ANY GOVERNMENT BE ALLOWED TO MAKE A COMPOUNDPRODUCED IN OUR BODIES ILLEGAL?) AS STRASSMAN NOTES, “CONSIDERING THE INTENSEPACE OF HUMAN RESEARCH WITH PSYCHEDELICS JUST THIRTY YEARS AGO, IT IS AMAZINGHOW LITTLE TODAY’S MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING PROGRAMS TEACH ABOUT THEM.PSYCHEDELICS WERE THE GROWTH AREA IN PSYCHIATRY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. NOW YOUNGPHYSICIANS AND PSYCHIATRISTS KNOW NEARLY NOTHING ABOUT THEM.”STRASSMAN RECALLED HIS OWN EXPERIENCE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE MID-1970S, WHENTHERE WERE ONLY TWO LECTURES ON THE SUBJECT. PSYCHEDELICS “BEGAN AS ‘WONDERDRUGS,’ TURNED INTO ‘HORROR DRUGS,’ THEN BECAME ‘NOTHING.’ ” HE BELIEVES THATTHE MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC PROFESSIONS WERE TRAUMATIZED BY THE WAY THE ERA OFPSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH ABRUPTLY ENDED. MANY OF THE LEADERS IN PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCHBEGAN THEIR CAREERS STUDYING PSYCHEDELICS: “THE MOST POWERFUL MEMBERS OF THEPROFESSION DISCOVERED THAT SCIENCE, DATA, AND REASON WERE INCAPABLE OF DEFENDINGTHEIR RESEARCH AGAINST THE ENACTMENT OF REPRESSIVE LAWS FUELED BY OPINION,EMOTION, AND THE MEDIA.” BUT AS THESE RESEARCHERS WERE SCIENTISTS, NOT LSDPRIESTS, THEY TURNED THEIR CAREERS TOWARD MORE SUPPORTABLE AREAS OF STUDY.THE UNPROVEN ASPECT OF STRASSMAN’S THESIS IS THAT DMT, LIKE MELATONIN, ISPRODUCED BY THE PINEAL GLAND. STRASSMAN SUSPECTS THAT THE PINEAL GLAND, ASINGULAR ORGAN BURIED DEEP IN THE BRAIN, ACTUALLY IS, AS DESCARTES AND OTHERSHAVE SPECULATED, THE SEAT OF THE SOUL. “THE PINEAL GLAND OF EVOLUTIONARILY OLDERANIMALS, SUCH AS LIZARDS AND AMPHIBIANS, IS ALSO CALLED THE ‘THIRD’ EYE. JUSTLIKE THE TWO SEEING EYES, THE THIRD EYE POSSESSES A LENS, CORNEA, AND RETINA. ITIS LIGHT-SENSITIVE AND HELPS REGULATE BODY TEMPERATURE AND SKIN COLORATION—TWOBASIC SURVIVAL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIGHT.” HE DISCOVERED THAT THEHUMAN PINEAL GLAND “BECOMES VISIBLE IN THE DEVELOPING FETUS AT SEVEN WEEKS, ORFORTY-NINE DAYS, AFTER CONCEPTION”—ALMOST PRECISELY THE SAME TIME THAT THE SEXOF THE FETUS IS DETERMINED. HE ALSO LEARNED THAT BUDDHISTS BELIEVE THE SOULREINCARNATES FORTY-NINE DAYS AFTER DEATH. ASTONISHED BY THIS SYNCHRONICITY, HEEVOLVED A HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PINEAL GLAND IS LIKE A RECEIVER THAT PICKS UP THESPIRIT—AN EXTRADIMENSIONAL VIBRATION THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE THE BODY—AND DMT IS THECONDUCTIVE ELEMENT. “WHEN OUR INDIVIDUAL LIFE FORCE ENTERS OUR FETAL BODY, THEMOMENT AT WHICH WE BECOME TRULY HUMAN, IT PASSES THROUGH THE PINEAL AND TRIGGERSTHE FIRST PRIMORDIAL FLOOD OF DMT. . . . AS WE DIE, THE LIFE-FORCE LEAVES THEBODY THROUGH THE PINEAL GLAND, RELEASING ANOTHER FLOOD OF THIS PSYCHEDELICSPIRIT MOLECULE.”FOR STRASSMAN, THIS THEORY WOULD EXPLAIN THE PINEAL GLAND’S UNIQUE STRUCTURE ANDPLACEMENT INSIDE THE BRAIN. FORMED FROM “SPECIALIZED CELLS ORIGINATING IN THEFETAL MOUTH,” THE PINEAL “NEARLY TOUCHES VISUAL AND AUDITORY SENSORY RELAYSTATIONS. THE EMOTIONAL CENTERS OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM SURROUND IT, AND ITSPOSITION ALLOWS FOR INSTANT DELIVERY OF ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY INTO THECEREBROSPINAL FLUID.” DMT IS QUICKLY DESTROYED IN THE BLOOD BY MAO ENZYMES, BUTIF IT WAS LOCATED IN THE PINEAL GLAND IT COULD DIFFUSE DIRECTLY INTO THE VISUAL,AUDITORY, AND EMOTIONAL CENTERS OF THE BRAIN. “THIS REASONING FURTHER DEVELOPSTHE IDEA THAT DECOMPOSING PINEAL TISSUE AFFECTS RESIDUAL AWARENESS AFTER DEATH,”HE WRITES. DMT, RELEASED BY THE PINEAL AFTER DEATH, COULD DIFFUSE THROUGH THE“SENSORY AND EMOTIONAL CENTERS” EVEN WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM,ALLOWING THE DEPARTING SOUL THE TIME TO MAKE THE LIFE REVIEW AND ENTER THE BARDODOMAINS DETAILED IN THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD. A MINIMAL FLOW OF DMT MIGHTALSO CATALYZE THE DREAM STATE DURING SLEEP.IF THIS THEORY WERE TRUE, STRASSMAN EXPECTED HIS DMT SUBJECTS WOULD REPORTVARIATIONS ON THE CLASSIC “NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE” MODEL—THE TUNNEL OF LIGHT, THELIFE REVIEW, THE TRANSCENDENT ASCENSION INTO FRACTAL REALITIES. INSTEAD, HISSUBJECTS WERE SUBMERGED IN A DISTURBINGLY ZANY DIMENSION. A FEW ACHIEVEDFULL-BLOWN MYSTICAL TRANSCENDENCE, BUT MANY ENTERED ZONES THAT WERE ONE PARTINSANE CLOWN POSSE, ONE PART LEPRECHAUN KITSCH, SPLICED WITH THE OUTTAKES OFPLAN NINE FROM OUTERSPACE.HERE IS ONE TYPICAL REPORT: “I SAW WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A LASVEGAS–CASINO TYPE OF SCENE, ALL FLASHING AND WHIRLING LIGHTS. I WAS RATHERDISAPPOINTED. . . . I ‘FLEW’ ON AND SAW SOME CLOWNS PERFORMING. THEY WERE LIKETOYS, OR ANIMATED CLOWNS.”HERE IS ANOTHER: “I FELT LIKE I WAS IN AN ALIEN LABORATORY, IN A HOSPITAL BED. .. . I WAS BEING CARTED AROUND. . . . THEY WEREN’T AS SURPRISED AS I WAS. IT WASINCREDIBLY UNPSYCHEDELIC. I WAS ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION IN DETAIL. THERE WAS ONEMAIN CREATURE, AND HE SEEMED TO BE BEHIND IT ALL, OVERSEEING EVERYTHING. THEOTHERS WERE ORDERLIES, OR DISORDERLIES. THEY ACTIVATED A SEXUAL CIRCUIT, AND IWAS FLUSHED WITH AN AMAZING ORGASMIC ENERGY. A GOOFY CHART POPPED UP LIKE ANX-RAY IN A CARTOON. . . . THEY WERE CHECKING MY INSTRUMENTS, TESTING THINGS.”HERE IS A THIRD: “THERE WERE FOUR DISTINCT BEINGS LOOKING DOWN ON ME, LIKE I WASON AN OPERATING-ROOM TABLE. . . . THEY HAD DONE SOMETHING AND WERE OBSERVING THERESULTS. THEY ARE VASTLY ADVANCED SCIENTIFICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY. THEY WERELOOKING JUST OVER THE TRACTION BAR IN FRONT OF ME. I GUESS THEY WERE SAYING,‘GOODBYE. DON’T BE A STRANGER.’ ” THIS SUBJECT NOTED, AT THE END OF THE TRIALS,THAT DMT HAD SHOWN HIM “THERE IS INFINITE VARIATION ON REALITY. THERE IS THEREAL POSSIBILITY OF ADJACENT DIMENSIONS. IT MAY NOT BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT THERE’SALIEN PLANETS WITH THEIR OWN SOCIETIES. THIS IS TOO PROXIMAL. IT’S NOT LIKE SOMEKIND OF DRUG. IT’S MORE LIKE AN EXPERIENCE OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAN A DRUG.”COMMON THEMES EMERGE IN THE REPORTS OF STRASSMAN’S SUBJECTS: IN SOME CASES, THEALIENS INSERTED A PROBE OR CABLE INTO THEIR EYES OR FOREARMS. OFTEN THE ALIENSSEEMED TO BE EXPECTING THE VISIT. AT OTHER TIMES THEY WERE SURPRISED BUTUNRUFFLED. SOMETIMES THERE SEEMS TO BE ONE ALIEN WITH A PARTICULAR BOND WITH THEHUMAN VISITOR. THE BEINGS SOMETIMES SHOWED THEM COLORFUL HIEROGLYPHS OF A HIGHLYCOMPLEX VISUAL LANGUAGE—THIS LAST A REPEATED MOTIF IN MCKENNA’S DMT RAVINGS.STRASSMAN’S BOOK IS FILLED WITH SAD EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE DOCTOR AND HISSUBJECTS. AS THEY RETURN TO THEIR BODIES FROM ALIEN REALMS THAT ARE MORE REALTHAN THIS REALITY, HE MAKES FEEBLE EFFORTS TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY HAVEEXPERIENCED SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL PROJECTION OR WAKING DREAM. THE SUBJECTS REACT TOHIS ATTEMPTS WITH CURT DISMISSAL OR ANNOYANCE. “WHEN REVIEWING MY BEDSIDE NOTES,I CONTINUALLY FEEL SURPRISE IN SEEING HOW MANY OF OUR VOLUNTEERS ‘MADE CONTACT’WITH ‘THEM,’ OR OTHER BEINGS. . . . THE ‘LIFE-FORMS’ LOOKED LIKE CLOWNS,REPTILES, MANTISES, BEES, SPIDERS, CACTI, AND STICK FIGURES.” POOR STRASSMAN:“IT IS STILL STARTLING TO SEE MY WRITTEN RECORDS OF COMMENTS. . . . IT’S AS IFMY MIND REFUSES TO ACCEPT WHAT’S THERE IN BLACK AND WHITE.” HE REALIZED THATMANY OF THE REPORTS OF HIS SUBJECTS DUPLICATED CLASSIC ACCOUNTS OF UFO VISITSAND ALIEN CONTACT. “THE RESEMBLANCE OF . . . THE ALIEN ABDUCTIONS OF‘EXPERIENCERS’ TO THE CONTACTS DESCRIBED BY OUR OWN VOLUNTEERS IS UNDENIABLE.HOW CAN ANYONE DOUBT, AFTER READING OUR ACCOUNTS . . . THAT DMT ELICITS‘TYPICAL’ ALIEN ENCOUNTERS?”ALTHOUGH STRASSMAN’S RESEARCH WAS NOT ORIENTED TOWARD PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC GOALS,HE WRITES THAT A MAJOR REASON HE STOPPED THE DMT STUDY WAS THAT HE SAW LITTLEBENEFICIAL IMPACT ON HIS SUBJECTS. “IT WAS ESPECIALLY DISAPPOINTING THAT NO ONEBEGAN PSYCHOTHERAPY OR A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE TO WORK FURTHER ON THE INSIGHTSTHEY FELT ON DMT,” HE WRITES. WHY DID STRASSMAN IMAGINE THAT DOSING SUBJECTSWITH A DRUG CAUSING EXTREME OUT-OF-BODY AND ALIEN ENCOUNTERS IN TEN MINUTES FLATWOULD LEAD TO NEW AGE JOURNEYS OF SELF-DISCOVERY? THIS IDEA APPEARS BOTH NAIVEAND PATRONIZING, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE REAL REASON HE ENDED THE STUDY WAS FEAR—ANONSPECIFIC ANXIETY SUMMED UP BY HIS “HIGHLY INTUITIVE” MASSAGE THERAPIST, WHOTOLD HIM SHE SAW “EVIL SPIRITS HOVERING AROUND YOU. THEY WANT TO COME THROUGHTHIS PLANE, USING YOU AND THE DRUGS.” HE WAS BLACKBALLED FROM HIS BUDDHISTCOMMUNITY AND TOLD “HALLUCINOGENS DISORDER AND CONFUSE THE MIND, IMPEDERELIGIOUS TRAINING, AND CAN BE A CAUSE OF REBIRTH INTO REALMS OF CONFUSION ANDSUFFERING”—DESPITE THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE WESTERN LEADERS OF HIS CENTERATTRIBUTED THEIR INITIAL PULL TO MYSTICISM TO LSD TRIPS.AS NOTED EARLIER, IN THE 1950S, RESEARCHERS DISCOVERED THAT “SET” AND “SETTING”WERE THE CRUCIAL DETERMINING FACTORS FOR A POSITIVE TRIP. THE MIND-STATE ANDEXPECTATIONS—THE “SET”—OF DR. STRASSMAN AND HIS SUBJECTS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN UPTO THE DEMANDING PARADOXES OF INNER-DIMENSIONAL TRAVEL—ALSO LACKING FROM HISACCOUNT IS A SHAMANIC ELEMENT OF SLY, SELF-REFLEXIVE WIT. THE HOSPITAL AMBIENCEOF STRASSMAN’S DMT STUDIES WAS ALSO A PROBLEM, PERHAPS PREDETERMINING SUBJECTSTO ENVISION THEMSELVES AS PATIENTS OR PASSIVE VICTIMS. THESE REPORTS CALL TOMIND ALLEN GINSBERG’S INITIAL RESPONSE TO LSD, GIVEN TO HIM BY DOCTORS IN AWINDOWLESS ROOM OF A PALO ALTO CLINIC: “I THOUGHT I WAS TRAPPED IN A GIANT WEBOF FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL THAT WERE PERHAPS EXPERIMENTING WITH ME OR WEREPERHAPS FROM ANOTHER PLANET OR WERE FROM SOME SUPER-GOVERNMENT OR COSMICMILITARY OR SCIENCE-FICTION BIG BROTHER,” HE RECALLED. IT MAY BE THE CASE THATHOSPITAL SETTINGS ARE JUST INAPPROPRIATE FOR STUDIES ON THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTSOF PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35DO YOU TAKERESPONSIBILITY?[images/00006.jpg] ONE OF THE SUBJECTS IN STRASSMAN’S STUDY WAS JIM DEKORNE, ANEW MEXICO GARDENER AND WELL-TRAVELED PSYCHONAUT. ON HIS HIGH DOSE OF DMT, HEFOUND HIMSELF FLYING TOWARD A “SPACE STATION”: “I WAS AWARE OF MANY OTHER BEINGSINSIDE THE SPACE STATION—AUTOMATONS: ANDROID-LIKE CREATURES THAT ‘LOOKED’ (ALLTHIS TRANSCENDS ORDINARY VISUAL DESCRIPTION) LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN CRASH DUMMIESAND THE EMPIRE TROOPS FROM STAR WARS. . . .” HE OPENED HIS EYES TO SEE THEDOCTOR AND NURSE AS ALIEN CLOWNS WITH HUGE BLUBBERY LIPS. DEKORNE WENT ON TOWRITE HIS OWN BOOK, PSYCHEDELIC SHAMANISM, IN WHICH HE EXPLORED HIS LONG-TERMRELATION TO PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS AND THE ENTITIES ENCOUNTERED IN WHAT HE TERMSMIND-SPACE. DEKORNE’S PERSONAL INQUIRY INTO SHAMANIC REALMS YIELDS A DEEPERLEVEL OF INSIGHT THAN STRASSMAN’S BUDDHIST/PSYCHIATRIC STRAIGHT-MAN APPROACH.IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS BOOK, DEKORNE, WITH OFFHAND HUMOR, RELATES A NUMBER OFEPISODES FROM HIS LIFE THAT WOULD BE “CONSIDERED BY MAINSTREAM SCIENCE ASANOMALOUS OR PARANORMAL AT BEST, AS DELUSIONS OR FRAUD AT WORST.” SOME OF THEEVENTS INVOLVED PSYCHOACTIVE CHEMICALS; OTHERS WERE SPONTANEOUSLY OCCURINGSTATES OF TRANCE OR INSIGHT. HE DESCRIBES AN LSD TRIP IN WHICH HE FELT COMPELLEDTO GRAB AN OLD MEXICAN MACHETE HE HAD HANGING ON THE WALL, THEN FELL TO HISKNEES AS A VOICE SPOKE IN HIS HEAD, ASKING HIM OVER AND OVER: “DO YOU TAKERESPONSIBILITY? . . . DO YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY?!!!” HE SCREAMED “YES”—“I FELTCERTAIN THAT IF I’D SAID ‘NO,’ I WOULD HAVE DROPPED DEAD ON THE SPOT,” HERECALLED. THAT NIGHT, AFTER COMING DOWN, DEKORNE HAD A DREAM: “MY MACHETE WAS INFRONT OF ME, HANGING SUSPENDED IN A PURE VOID OF INFINITE DARKNESS. ETCHED ONTHE BLADE WERE HEBREW LETTERS IN LIVING FIRE. . . . THE MACHETE DISAPPEARED ANDONLY THE FIERY LETTERS REMAINED SUSPENDED IN THE VOID. THEN THEY BEGAN TO MOVEAND RE-FORM THEMSELVES IN THE ROMAN ALPHABET TO SPELL ‘SEPHIROTH’ IN FIRE.”DEKORNE WAS NOT JEWISH. HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT “SEPHIROTH” MEANT, AND COULD NOTFIND THE WORD IN HIS DICTIONARY. TWO WEEKS LATER, BROWSING IN A BOOKSTORE, HECHECKED A GLOSSARY OF OCCULT TERMS AND READ: “SEPHIROTH: THE TEN EMANATIONS OFGOD IN THE JEWISH KABBALAH.” HE WAS STUNNED; HE HAD ONLY VAGUELY HEARD OF THEKABBALAH BEFORE.HE LEARNED THAT HIS ENCOUNTER CORRESPONDED TO THE “SEVENTEENTH PATH ON THE TREEOF LIFE,” ALTHOUGH HE NEVER UNTANGLED ALL OF THE IMPLICATIONS. THE IMAGE OF ASWORD, THE NOTION OF A CROSSROADS, AND THE DRUG ERGOT—THE SOURCE OF LSD—WERECONNECTED TO IT. HE LATER READ STANISLAV GROF ON LSD THERAPY AND FOUND THISREMARK: “INDIVIDUALS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE KABBALAH HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES DESCRIBEDIN THE ZOHAR AND SEPHER YETZIRAH [TWO CLASSICAL KABBALISTIC TEXTS] AND HAVEDEMONSTRATED A SURPRISING FAMILIARITY WITH KABBALISTIC SYMBOLS.” DEKORNE, LIKEROBERT IN PALENQUE, DISCOVERED AN INNATE PULL, AS IF HIS UNCONSCIOUS HAD ITS OWNTRACTION OR HE WAS CONNECTING WITH SOME RESIDUE FROM A PREVIOUS LIFE, TOWARDSHAMANIC AND MYSTICAL EXPLORATION.HIS EXPERIENCES LED HIM TO ADOPT A JUNGIAN VIEW OF THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS,AND OF AN INNER SELF THAT TRANSCENDS THE EGO’S CONSTRAINTS. HIS OWN LIFE TAUGHTHIM THAT “THE HUMAN PSYCHE TRANSCENDS CORPOREAL EXISTENCE, THEREFORE WE MUST BEMULTIDIMENSIONAL ENTITIES. . . . THE EGO IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE PSYCHE, BUTONLY THE SPACE/TIME PORTION OF A GREATER REALITY WHICH UNFOLDS AND REVEALSITSELF FROM WHAT THE EGO PERCEIVES AS ITS OWN UNCONSCIOUS MIND.”LIKE MCKENNA, DEKORNE ACCEPTS THE SHAMANIC MAP OF THE COSMOS; BY THIS MODEL, THEWORLD OF PHYSICAL EXISTENCE IS A “MIDDLE WORLD” BETWEEN THE UPPER AND LOWERREALMS ACCESSED VIA ALTERED STATES, INTUITIONS, AND DREAMS. IT IS EASY FOR US TOCOMPREHEND HOW A ZERO-DIMENSIONAL POINT BECOMES A ONE-DIMENSIONAL LINE, HOW ALINE EXTENDS INTO A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLANE, AND HOW A PLANE IS EXTENDED TO BECOMEA THREE-DIMENSIONAL CUBE. JUST AS TIME IS AN EXTRA DIMENSION THAT EXTENDS FROMSPACE, THE “IMAGINAL REALMS,” OR “MIND-SPACE,” ARE REAL DOMAINS THAT EXTEND FROMTHE DIMENSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS. “THE SHAMAN, IN EFFECT, IS AN EGO WHO HASLEARNED HOW TO RECONNECT WITH HIS SOURCE IN MIND-SPACE (JUNG’S COLLECTIVEUNCONSCIOUS),” HE WRITES. THE EXPLORER OF “MIND-SPACE” FIRST DISCOVERS ALANDSCAPE, INCLUDING BEINGS AND ARTIFACTS THAT RELATE TO HIS OWN HISTORY, BUT INTHAT NEW LAND HE ALSO ENCOUNTERS “OTHER” EXTRADIMENSIONAL ENTITIES. THE GNOSTICSHAD A WORD FOR THIS INNER KINGDOM OF SPIRITUAL BEINGS. THEY CALLED IT THEPLEROMA, A GREEK TERM FOR FULLNESS OR PLENITUDE, LATER USED BY JUNG.ONCE YOU ENCOUNTER THE SHAMANIC DIMENSIONS, YOU REALIZE THESE OTHER REALMS MUSTHAVE THEIR OWN ECOLOGY, THEIR OWN HIERARCHIES AND OPERATIONAL LOGIC. DEKORNEEXAMINES THE MODELS PROVIDED BY AMAZONIAN SHAMANS, TIBETAN BUDDHISTS,RENAISSANCE ALCHEMISTS, AND THE WESTERN OCCULT PHILOSOPHY OF ALEISTER CROWLEY INAN EFFORT TO COMPREHEND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE PSYCHOCOSMOS. EVERY MYSTICALTRADITION POSITS THE EXISTENCE OF SPIRITS OR DEITIES THAT SEEK TO COMPEL THEATTENTION AND BELIEF OF HUMAN BEINGS. IN THE UPANISHADS, THE TERM FOR SUCHENTITIES IS “DEVAS.” THE HINDU TEXT STATES: “NOW IF A MAN WORSHIPS ANOTHERDEITY, THINKING THE DEITY IS ONE AND HE ANOTHER, HE DOES NOT KNOW. HE IS LIKE ABEAST FOR THE DEVAS.” THE GNOSTIC TERM FOR SUCH ENTITIES IS “ARCHONS.” THEGNOSTICS BELIEVED THAT THE ARCHONS FEED ON THE HUMAN SOUL, “THE DEW FROM ABOVE,”AND THEY TRY TO KEEP HUMAN BEINGS IMPRISONED IN THE FALLEN WORLD OF PHYSICALREALITY AND IGNORANCE. DEKORNE SUGGESTS THAT THESE “ULTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES”ARE NOURISHED BY HUMAN BELIEF AND HUMAN WILL: “AS MONADS OF THE IMAGINAL REALM,EACH ARCHON SEEKS TO MAINTAIN ITSELF, AND WILL CONCEIVABLY SAY OR DO WHATEVER ISNECESSARY TO GAIN OUR ATTENTION AND WORSHIP. . . . WITHOUT WORSHIP, A GODSTARVES AND IS ABSORBED (EATEN) BY SOME OTHER ENTITY.”“WHO CAN SAY THAT BELIEF IS NOT A FORM OF ENERGY, IS NOT FOOD OR FUEL USED INMORE ABSTRACT REALMS OF EXISTENCE BY ENTITIES WE HAVE ALWAYS PERCEIVED AS GODS?”HE ASKS. WHEN VOICES SPEAK IN THE HEADS OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS, THEY TEND TODEMAND BIZARRE BEHAVIOR AND SELF-SACRIFICES. SIMILARLY, IN THE NEW AGE CULTUREOF CHANNELERS, THE CHANNELED ENTITIES OFTEN SPEAK IN PATRONIZING AND DEMANDINGTONES. “THIS CRUEL AND ARROGANT . . . ATTITUDE OF THE ARCHONS IS ONLY NATURAL .. . IF WE COMPARE THEIR BEHAVIOR WITH THE WAY WE TREAT FOOD IN OUR OWNDIMENSION.” NOBODY, NOT EVEN THE MOST SOFTHEARTED VEGETARIAN, ASKS THE FEELINGSOF A POTATO BEFORE DEVOURING IT.THIS VIEWPOINT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE MYSTIC GURDJIEFF, WHO BELIEVED THATEVERYTHING, INCLUDING PSYCHIC PROCESSES AND THOUGHTS, IS ACTUALLY A FORM OFMATERIAL—AND ALL MATERIAL IS, TO SOME EXTENT, SENTIENT. “EVERYTHING IN ITS OWNWAY IS INTELLIGENT AND CONSCIOUS,” HE SAID. “THE DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESSCORRESPONDS TO THE DEGREE OF DENSITY OR THE SPEED OF VIBRATIONS. THE DENSER THEMATTER, THE LESS CONSCIOUS IT IS.” IN HIS VIEW, THE COSMOS EMPLOYS A SYSTEM OF“RECIPROCAL MAINTENANCE,” WITH EACH LEVEL OF BEING FEEDING ON THE BEINGS BENEATHIT. THE SENTIENT SOULS OF HUMAN BEINGS SUSTAIN THE HIGHER VIBRATIONAL DEMIURGESABOVE THEM.DEKORNE’S BOOK “HOLDS TO THE SHAMANIC MODEL OF MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS, ACCESSED VIAHUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS, IN WHICH DISSOCIATED INTELLIGENCES FEED OFF OF HUMAN BELIEFSYSTEMS THE WAY THAT WE EAT HAMBURGER,” HE WRITES. “IT IS TO THESE ENTITIES’ADVANTAGE TO KEEP US IGNORANT OF THEIR AGENDAS; THEY WOULD FORFEIT INDEPENDENTEXISTENCE IF WE CHOSE TO BECOME GODS OURSELVES BY DEVOURING THEIR ENERGY INSTEADOF VICE-VERSA.” THROUGH SHAMANIC EXPLORATION, HUMANS CAN LEARN TO BECOMEPARTNERS, PERHAPS EQUALS, WITH SUCH IMAGINAL ENTITIES, RATHER THAN NUTRITIONALSUPPLEMENTS. “IT FOLLOWS THAT THE WISELY INTENTIONAL USE OF ANY PSYCHEDELIC DRUGIS AS A SELF-INTEGRATING, SELF-EMPOWERING CATALYST. IN THIS WAY THE GODS (DEVAS,ARCHONS, SPIRITS, BELIEF COMPLEXES, ETC.) CANNOT COERCE OUR WORSHIP—WE COERCETHEIRS IN THE FORM OF ENHANCED PERSONAL POWER.” THE LESSON OF SHAMANISM, OFVISITS TO DIFFERENT REALITIES, IS THAT WE HAVE TO GROW UP, BECOME ADULTS, ANDCLAIM OUR OWN AGENCY IN THE IMAGINAL REALM AS WELL AS THE “REAL WORLD” OFPHYSICAL REALITY.PART OF WHAT I LOVE ABOUT DEKORNE’S BOOK IS THAT HE SEEMS TO ACCURATELY DEFINENOT ONLY THE SHAMANIC DIMENSIONS BUT SOMETHING CRUCIAL ABOUT HOW THE “REALWORLD” FUNCTIONS. IN OUR LIVES, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT BELIEFS HAVE INDEPENDENTENERGY AND VITALITY. BELIEFS COMPEL FOLLOWINGS AND TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN,LEAPING FROM HOST TO HOST. THE BELIEF SYSTEMS ACTIVE IN CONTROLLING OURWORLD—WHETHER CALLED “PATRIOTISM,” “FREE MARKET CAPITALISM,” OR EVEN “HIGHCULTURE”—BEHAVE LIKE DANGEROUSLY INDEPENDENT FORCES, SELF-PROPELLING VIRUSES, ORLIKE DEMIURGES, DEVAS, OR ARCHONS. BOTH GURDJIEFF’S PHILOSOPHY AND THEPSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE SUGGEST THAT SPIRITUAL GROWTH REQUIRES INCREASING OURLEVEL OF SELF-AWARENESS AND REFUSING TO IDENTIFY WITH ANY EXTERNAL AGENCY.PERHAPS OUR BELIEF SYSTEMS, AND EVEN OUR SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED PERSONALITIES OREGOS, FUNCTION LIKE LAYERS OF INSULATION THAT MUST BE STRIPPED AWAY IF WE WANTTO DISCOVER WHAT WE CAN BECOME."},{"pageContent":"[images/00013.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36NOT FOR HUMANCONSUMPTION[images/00006.jpg] I MET DAVE IN PALENQUE. HE HAD STARTED A COMPANY SELLINGEXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH CHEMICALS THAT WERE LABELED “NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION,”ALTHOUGH MOST OF THEM COULD BE FOUND IN THE BACK PAGES OF SASHA SHULGIN’S BOOKS.SITTING BY THE POOL ONE DAY, I HEARD DAVE TELL HOW HE HAD STUDIED TO BE A PRIESTBUT DROPPED OUT TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL MASSEUR. BY SOME CIRCUITOUS ROUTE—ATYPICAL TANGLED AMERICAN ODYSSEY—HE MADE HIS WAY FROM THE MIAMI BEACH YACHTSCENE TO PSYCHEDELICS AND THE CUTTING EDGE OF MIND-EXPANSION. IN PALENQUE, DAVEINVITED ME TO JOIN HIS PRIVATE RESEARCH GROUP, GIVING ME FREE AND LOW-PRICEDINTRODUCTIONS TO SOME NEW CHEMICALS, AS WELL AS HIS REGULAR CATALOG OFLITTLE-KNOWN AND UNSCHEDULED COMPOUNDS. (FEARING INTENSIFIED GOVERNMENTSURVEILLANCE, HE WOULD CLOSE HIS COMPANY THE DAY AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11TERRORIST ATTACKS, EVEN THOUGH HIS BUSINESS WAS NOT CLEARLY ILLEGAL.)BACK IN NEW YORK, I ORDERED A FEW THINGS FROM HIS CATALOG. THEY CAME TO MY HOMEIN PLAIN ENVELOPES LABELED WITH INTIMIDATING CHEMICAL NAMES. FOR $125, I BOUGHTONE GRAM OF A YELLOWISH POWDER CALLED DPT, DIPROPYLTRYPTAMINE, A CHEMICAL COUSINOF DMT, SUBSTITUTING PROPYL FOR METHYL.PROPYL AND METHYL ARE SIMPLE CARBON COMPOUNDS, TWO OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS OFORGANIC MATTER. THERE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, METHYL ALCOHOL, WOOD ALCOHOL, AND PROPYLALCOHOL, RUBBING ALCOHOL. IN GAS FORM, THERE IS PROPANE AND METHANE. THETRYPTAMINE MOLECULE IS THE BUILDING BLOCK OF MANY NEUROTRANSMITTERS, AND OF MANYPSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUNDS. SEROTONIN IS A TRYPTAMINE. AS FAR AS I CAN ASCERTAIN,DPT, UNLIKE DMT, DOES NOT OCCUR IN NATURE, WHICH MEANS IT DID NOT EXIST UNTIL ITWAS SYNTHESIZED IN A LABORATORY A FEW DECADES AGO. WHILE DMT, AN ENDOGENOUSCHEMICAL INSIDE THE BODY, IS RECOGNIZED BY MAO ENZYMES AND IMMEDIATELYNEUTRALIZED, DPT, A NEW CONCOCTION, IS NOT. THEREFORE IT CROSSES THE BLOOD-BRAINBARRIER THROUGH DIRECT SNIFFING OR SWALLOWING. BUT THE MOST ASTONISHING ASPECTOF THE TWO CHEMICALS IS THAT, DESPITE THEIR SIMILARITY, THEY REVEAL COMPLETELYDIFFERENT WORLDS. WHY IS THIS THE CASE?IN SHULGIN’S BOOK AND ON THE INTERNET I FOUND ACCOUNTS OF DPT TRIPS. SOMEDESCRIBED THE EFFECTS AS TERRIFYING: “THE WHOLE UNIVERSE FALLS APART, ALL COLORSIN ELECTRIK AIR WHIRLPOOL INTO A MANDALA, EATEN UP FOREVER. THAT’S IT, THEWORLD’S OVER.” OTHERS FELT, AFTER SMOKING THE DRUG, THEY ENTERED, FOR THE FIRSTTIME, THE “CLEAR LIGHT” OF GOD. ANOTHER REPORT WAS MORE NARRATIVE: “I WAS BEINGLED BY A WISE OLD MAN WHO I KNOW WAS GOD. . . . I WAS HANDED A TORAH FOR ME TOCARRY AS A SIGN THAT I HAD BEEN ACCEPTED, AND FORGIVEN, AND COME HOME.” SHULGINALSO MENTIONED A CHURCH IN NEW YORK, TEMPLE OF THE TRUE INNER LIGHT, WHICH USESDPT AS ITS SACRAMENT. CLEARLY DPT WAS A SERIOUS MIND-WARPER. I PUT THE SLIMENVELOPE OF POWDER IN THE REFRIGERATOR, WHERE IT SAT FOR MONTHS.I AM OFTEN CAUGHT BETWEEN A DESIRE FOR NEW AND INTENSE ALTERED STATES ANDANXIETY. WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH A DOORWAY TO WHAT MAY ACTUALLY BE A DIFFERENTDIMENSION, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL EMERGE AS EXACTLY THE SAME PERSONYOU WERE BEFORE. AFTER YOUR FIRST SERIOUS LSD OR MUSHROOM OR DMT TRIP, YOUREALLY ARE NEVER QUITE THE SAME—YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVE ONYOUR PSYCHE, YOU HAVE BEEN RELATIVIZED. YOU MAY SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFESUPPRESSING THE MEMORY, BUT IT IS STILL THERE INSIDE OF YOU. AFTER DPT, IUNDERSTOOD WHAT DON JUAN TOLD CASTANEDA: “WE ARE MEN AND OUR LOT IS TO LEARN ANDTO BE HURLED INTO INCONCEIVABLE NEW WORLDS.”PSYCHEDELICS ARE CATALYSTS FOR TRANSFORMATION, AND WHEN YOU TAKE THEM, YOU HAVETO BE READY TO TRANSFORM. OUR SOCIETY SEEMS TO BE CHANGING RAPIDLY, BUT THEPSYCHEDELIC REALMS MOVE WITH A TREMENDOUS VELOCITY. THEY MAKE THE ACHIEVEMENTSOF OUR PRESENT-DAY TECHNOLOGY SEEM TRAGICALLY ANTIQUE. WHILE THESE CHEMICALSSHOULD NOT BE DEMONIZED OR TRIVIALIZED, THEY ALSO CANNOT BE REDUCED TOTHERAPEUTIC TOOLS. THEY ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN OUR CATEGORIES. SOMEDAY, THEY MAYHELP US ESTABLISH A SCIENCE OF THE SPIRIT. AT THE MOMENT, ALL WE CAN SAY IS THATTHEY SHOULD BE TREATED WITH TREMENDOUS RESPECT. IT IS GOOD TO BE SCIENTIFICALLYPRECISE ABOUT DOSAGES AND REACTION TIMES, TO KNOW, AS BEST AS YOU CAN, WHAT THECHEMICAL WILL DO TO YOU, AND WHY YOU ARE TAKING IT. BECAUSE I DIDN’T KNOWEXACTLY WHAT DPT WAS, OR WHAT I WANTED FROM IT, I BOUGHT IT AND THEN SHEEPISHLYLEFT IT ALONE.MY CAUTIOUS RESISTENCE TO THE DPT LURE CONTINUED UNTIL ONE NIGHT, AFTER A PARTY.FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS I WAS DRUNK. I WAS WITH TWO OLD FRIENDS, TWINBROTHERS, WHO WERE EAGER TO TRY THE DPT IN MY FRIDGE. WE EACH SNORTED A LINE,AND FOR ME IT WAS AN INTERESTING DISASTER. I WAS BOTH DRUNK AND TRIPPING. ON THEONE HAND, THE WORLD WAS A WOOZY MESS; ON THE OTHER HAND, I WAS SEEING IT WITH ARAZOR-EDGE PRECISION AND IN THE MOST VIBRANT COLORS. WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES, ISAW MUTICOLORED THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRIANGLES ROTATING IN DEEP SPACE. I REALIZEDLATER THAT I HAD FOOLISHLY USED ALCOHOL TO OVERCOME MY FEAR OF DPT THE WAY IUSED TO DRINK FOR THE COURAGE TO TALK TO GIRLS AT BARS. I DIDN’T LIKE DPT. THEDPT REALM SEEMED ICY, ANNIHILATING. I TOLD MY FRIENDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN, “THISIS EVIL. THIS IS NOT TO BE EXPLORED. THIS IS THE WRONG DOORWAY.” IN RETROSPECT,I DON’T THINK I WAS EXPLORING THE DPT REALM ON THAT TRIP. I THINK, INSTEAD, THEDPT REALM WAS BEGINNING ITS EXPLORATION OF ME.BECAUSE THIS IS A STORY NOT JUST ABOUT CHEMICALS BUT ABOUT OCCULTCORRESPONDENCES AND PSYCHIC EVENTS, I WILL NOTE THAT LATER THAT NIGHT WE WENTOUT TO A BAR AND STARTED TALKING TO THE PEOPLE NEXT TO US. FOR SOME REASON ITALKED ABOUT THE END TIMES AND 2012, THE HOPI AND MAYAN PROPHECIES. ONE OF OURNEIGHBORS DESCRIBED A VIVID DREAM SHE HAD WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER THAT HADSTAYED WITH HER EVER SINCE: “I WAS IN A SPACESHIP FULL OF PEOPLE. WE WERELIFTING OFF FROM EARTH. I LOOKED BACK AT THE EARTH AND THERE WAS BROWN CRUSTWHERE THE LAND HAD BEEN. WE SHOT INTO SPACE AND WENT A LONG WAY. THEN AN ANGELAPPEARED TO US. HE SAID THAT GOD HAD DECIDED TO REJUVENATE THE EARTH, EVENTHOUGH WE HAD RUINED IT. HE WAS GOING TO START AGAIN, DO IT ALL OVER FROMSCRATCH. FOR THE TIME BEING WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT IN LIMBO. AND HEPOINTED TO A VAST GRAY SPACE WHERE MANY PEOPLE WERE ALREADY WAITING. WE HAD TOLEAVE THE SPACESHIP TO GO THERE.”IT WAS ANOTHER FEW MONTHS BEFORE I TRIED DPT AGAIN.IN THE MEANTIME, ANOTHER NEW FRIEND FROM PALENQUE ACCEPTED MY INVITATION ANDCAME TO NEW YORK. THIS WAS CHARITY THE FIRE DANCER. TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OLD,SKILLED AT TAROT AND CEREMONIAL MAGIC, A PROFESSIONAL STRIPPER, SHE WAS THEFEARLESS AND PIXIELIKE EMBODIMENT OF THE NEW CULTURE I HAD FOUND AT BURNING MAN.IN MEXICO, I TOLD HER I COULD FIND HER A FREE PLACE TO STAY IN NEW YORK, AND SHEHITCHHIKED ALL THE WAY FROM PALENQUE WITH HER CAT, PROMETHEUS, CATCHING RIDESFROM TRUCKERS AT TRUCK STOPS. UNLIKE ME, CHARITY HAD NO FEAR OF NEWPSYCHEDELICS. SHE KEPT A LIST OF ALL THE DRUGS SHE HAD TRIED, AND THE NUMBER WASUP TO FORTY-THREE. I TOLD HER I HAD THIS DPT STUFF AROUND, AND OF COURSE SHEWANTED TO TRY IT.CHARITY AND I TOOK DPT AT MY HOUSE ONE NIGHT—ONCE AGAIN, I HAD TO OVERCOME ANINTENSE INITIAL RELUCTANCE. FINALLY I PUT SOME OF THE YELLOWISH POWDER INTO APILL AND SWALLOWED IT, BUT GOT NO EFFECT. SHE SNIFFED A LINE, AND ALMOSTINSTANTLY WENT INTO A TRANCE. WHEN HER TRIP WAS OVER, SHE TOLD ME I HAD TO TRYSNIFFING IT. SHE HAD SEEN INCREDIBLE THINGS.SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU TRIP, IT SEEMS THAT ALL OF THE PSYCHIC MATTER, SWIRLINGAROUND IN THE HOURS AND DAYS BEFOREHAND, GATHERS TOGETHER, LIKE PARTICLESGALVANIZED BY A MAGNET, AND PUSHES THE JOURNEY IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. THESEINFLUENCES CAN SEEM LIKE THE KARMIC TRACE OF SOME LARGER PATTERN OR SUBCONSCIOUSINTENTION. EARLIER THAT NIGHT CHARITY HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE “PSYCHIC VAMPIRES”WHO ROAMED THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO, SOME OF THEM HOMELESS HIPPIES, WHOWOULD PICK UP VIBRATIONS FROM STRANGERS, TALK TO THEM, AND SUCK THEIR ENERGYAWAY. I LAUGHED AT THIS. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE BOOKS OF ZECHARIA SITCHIN,WHOSE SCHOLARLY RESEARCH CONVINCED HIM THAT A RACE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL GIANTSHAD CREATED HUMAN BEINGS, LONG AGO, TO SERVE THEM AS SLAVES—A VARIATION ON THECONCEPT OF THE “ARCHONS” FROM GNOSTICISM. ACCORDING TO SITCHIN, THE MAGNIFICENTCRUELTY OF THE ALIEN RACE THAT CREATED US WAS BEYOND OUR IMAGINING.CHARITY CUT TWO BIG LINES OF THE DPT ON THE TABLE, AND I SNORTED ONE. THE POWDERBURNED MY NASAL PASSAGES. BITTER RESIDUE DRIPPED DOWN THE BACK OF MY THROAT. ISTRETCHED OUT ON THE COUCH. I CLOSED MY EYES AND ENTERED THE DPT REALM.WE WERE LISTENING TO MOODY TECHNO MUSIC. WITH EACH CHANGE IN BEAT, WITH EACHSKITTER OF SAMPLED NOISE, I SAW A BRAND-NEW AND EXTREMELY DETAILED DEMONIC REALMSWIRL BEFORE ME IN COBALT, SCARLET, PURPLE GOSSAMER HUES. AT MOMENTS THERESEEMED TO BE SOME INCREDIBLY ELEGANT YET VIOLENTLY ORGIASTIC PARTY TAKING PLACEWITH BEAUTIFUL FEMALES IN EVENING GOWNS AND MEN IN EDWARDIAN TOPCOATS IN THESPACIOUS PARLORS OF A HUGE AND OPULENT MANSION. AT OTHER TIMES THERE SEEMED TOBE BAT OR BUTTERFLY-WINGED CREATURES—LONG AND QUIVERING ANTENNAES, VELVET COATSAND EMERALD EYES, STILETTO TALONS—RISING INTO OTHERWORLDLY SKIES, WANDERINGFUTURISTIC CITIES. I HAD AN IMPRESSION OF TREMENDOUS VANITY. “I” WAS BEING USEDAS A MIRROR FOR THE DPT BEINGS TO ADMIRE THEMSELVES. BUT THEIR REALM WAS FARBEYOND WHAT CAN BE EXPRESSED IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE IN ITS SPEED OF TRANSMUTATION,ITS SHIVERING QUICKSILVER BEAUTY.THE WORLDS REVEALED WERE LIKE ENDLESS FACETS OF A TWIRLING DIAMOND—I FELT THEREAL POSSIBILITY OF BEING TRAPPED INSIDE ANY OF THOSE FACETS, A KIND OFSOUL-PRISON, FOR ETERNITY. THAT WAS THE TERROR OF IT. AS WITH SMOKING SALVIA, IHAD THE SENSE THAT SOME PART OF ME HAD ALWAYS BEEN STUCK IN THIS GOTHIC DPTPRISON, TRAPPED THERE ETERNALLY. I SOMEHOW UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS NOT MY FIRSTVISIT, NOR MY LAST.FOR A FLICKER OF FOREVER, I WAS IMPRISONED IN A POSTMODERN BAR SURROUNDED BYGLEAMING MIRRORS WITH A HYPERSLICK LOUNGE LIZARD WEARING A WHITE MOHAWK ANDSYNTHETIC FABRICS. HE WAS SITTING AT THE BAR, DRINKING A HIGHBALL. THERE WERE NODOORS OR WINDOWS IN THIS ROOM, NO ESCAPE POSSIBLE. THE GRAPHICS OF THIS VISIONWERE HIGH-RES AND HYPERPERFECT. OTHER SHARDS OF THE DPT REALM SHARED THIS SCI-FIQUALITY. DPT WAS A POSTMODERN DEMONIC MTV PSYCHEDELIC.THE SLEEK, RHYTHMICAL MESH OF THE MUSIC SEEMED WOVEN INTO THE LURID FABRIC OFTHE DARKNESS, THE REVELATION OF SINISTER FORCES COMING TO LIFE BEHIND MYEYELIDS.LIKE DMT, THE LEVEL OF VISUAL ORGANIZATION OF THE DPT REALM WAS FAR BEYONDANYTHING THAT THE SYNAPTICAL WIRING OF MY BRAIN COULD CREATE—IT WAS, IN ITS OWNPEACOCK-FEATHERY WAY, NOT JUST AS REAL AS THIS REALITY, BUT FAR MORE REAL,CRACKLING WITH POWER. I FELT FROM THE ENTITIES EXPLORING MY MIND A KIND OFCONTEMPT, A DISDAIN FOR HUMAN BEINGS TRAPPED IN OUR PITIFULLY UNSOPHISTICATEDDOMAIN, OUR MEAT REALM. THEY SEEMED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN BEMUSED AND ENRAGED THATWE HAD TRESPASSED.IN SHAMANIC CULTURES, THE TAKING OF ENTHEOGENIC SUBSTANCES IS ALWAYS SURROUNDEDBY RITUAL. A CIRCLE OF PROTECTION IS CREATED, THE FOUR DIRECTIONS INVOKED, THESPIRITS ASKED FOR THEIR BLESSING THROUGH AN OFFERING OF TOBACCO AND PRAYER.BECAUSE WE WERE SNIFFING A CHEMICAL POWDER IN A MODERN NEW YORK APARTMENT, ACHEMICAL WITHOUT A LONG HISTORY OF HUMAN USE, IT DIDN’T EVEN OCCUR TO US TO TAKESUCH PRECAUTIONS. I WAS JEALOUS OF CHARITY BECAUSE SHE MANAGED TO GET TO THEKITCHEN SINK AND THROW UP. SHE VOMITED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN A ROW—LATER SHESAID SHE SAW A MALE ENTITY IN THE SINK WITH A KIND OF DEVICE OR MACHINE THAT HEWAS USING TO SOAK UP THE ENERGY SHE WAS EXPULSING, JEERING AT HER AS HE DID IT.THE DEMON TOLD HER HIS NAME BUT SHE COULDN’T RECALL IT. I COULDN’T THROW UP. ISUSPECTED THAT I HAD FINALLY, AND COMPLETELY, MANAGED TO DESTROY MYSELF. I WASCONVINCED I WOULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THIS ONSLAUGHT. I STAGGERED TO THE CDPLAYER AND CHANGED THE MUSIC TO BACH, WHICH HELPED A LITTLE. WITH MY EYESOPENED, TRANSFORMATIONAL ENERGY SEEMED TO BE CRAWLING OVER EVERYTHING,FLICKERING AND RECEDING LIKE WAVES OF SENTIENT POWER—VAMPIRIC ELECTRICITY. MYHANDS LOOKED AND FELT LIKE CLAWS MADE OUT OF WIRES. WHEN I OPENED MY EYES ONAYAHUASCA, I ALSO FELT AND SAW ENERGY PASSING LIKE A WAVE FORM, BUT IT WAS MOREHUMAN SOMEHOW. HERE THE SPEED OF THE WAVES WAS MUCH FASTER AND MORE BRUTAL THANTHE YAGÉ FLARES. THE EXPERIENCE WAS UNMAMMALIAN, FUTURISTIC, INHUMAN.NOT ONLY WAS IT SUDDENLY OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A SOUL, IT WASALSO CLEAR THAT I WAS IN DANGER OF LOSING MINE PERMANENTLY.I SOMEHOW UNDERSTOOD THAT THE DPT REALM HAD EVOLVED OVER AN INCREDIBLY LONGPERIOD—MILLIONS OF YEARS, IF TIME HAS THE SAME KIND OF MEANING TO ITSINHABITANTS AS IT DOES TO US. I REALIZED THERE ARE DIABOLICAL HIERARCHIES,SECRET CABALS, VAST LIBRARIES OF WICKEDNESS TO BE STUDIED OVER MILLENNIA. IT WASOBVIOUS THAT WE LITTLE HUMAN BEINGS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON INTHE COSMOS. THE WORD BAROQUE DOESN’T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE JADED EMPTINESSAND SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THAT EVANESCENT EMPIRE. A LITTLE BIT LIKE SOFTCANDLE-FLIMMER WORLDS ONE SEES ON HASH AND OPIUM, BUT ETCHED IN PERFECTSOLID-STATE REALITY—MORE THAN PHOTOGRAPHIC. THE SLEEKNESS OF THE DPT DIMENSIONWAS BEYOND BELIEF.ABOUT HALF AN HOUR INTO THE TRIP, PAST THREE A.M., I CALLED MY FRIEND TONY.“THIS IS TOTAL MAGIC, TOTAL SORCERY. I AM WATCHING ENDLESS GOTHIC DEMONUNIVERSES MIRRORING EACH OTHER,” I BABBLED. “IF SOMEONE COULD BE AT HOME HERE,LEARN TO CONTROL THINGS HERE, THEY COULD GAIN SUCH POWER THEY COULD JUST WALKRIGHT THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE WHITE HOUSE, DO ANYTHING, BUT IT WOULDN’T MATTER,BECAUSE THEY WOULD ALREADY BE PART OF SUCH AN ANCIENT CONSPIRACY.” I HAD BEGUNTO PACE AROUND THE HOUSE, AND AS I PACED, I FOUND THAT I WAS MOVING MY ARMS INTHE AIR, MAKING “PASSES” LIKE THE SHAMANIC GESTURES DESCRIBED IN CASTANEDA’SWORK. THESE GESTURES CAME TO ME INTUITIVELY. THEY HELPED CONTROL THEOVERWHELMING SENSE OF ASSAULT.“DANIEL, DON’T BE TAKEN IN BY IT. IT’S JUST SAMSARA,” TONY SAID. HIS VOICE WAS ASOOTHING LIFELINE. HE LAUGHED AT ME. HE TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT THE TRIP WOULDEND SOON, THAT I WASN’T PERMANENTLY FRIED. HE TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT IWAS DOING, SINCE I HAD CALLED DPT “EVIL” AFTER MY FIRST ATTEMPT.“WHAT’S THAT MUSIC YOU’RE PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND?” HE ASKED.“BACH,” I TOLD HIM. “IT’S THE ONLY THING THAT’S KEEPING ME TOGETHER. PERHAPSTHAT’S WHY THEY ARE HERE; THE DEMONS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE MUSIC. THEY ARECROWDING IN HERE TO BE CLOSE TO IT.”“WELL, THAT’S NICE,” HE SAID.“THERE’S NOTHING NICE ABOUT THAT!” I SCREECHED AT HIM. “THEY ARE TOTALLYDEFIANT. THEY DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT US; WE ARE THEIR PUPPETS.”BUT AT THIS POINT THE TRIP WAS STARTING TO WIND DOWN. IN A FEW MINUTES CHARITYAND I WERE BACK IN THAT MIRACULOUS ILLUSION OF STABILITY WE CALL “REALITY” ONCEAGAIN. I FELT INCREDIBLY RELIEVED. “WOW, I CAN’T BELIEVE IT,” I SAID TO TONY.“REALITY . . . THIS IS DEFINITELY A GOOD THING!”IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, HOWEVER, I LEARNED THAT I WASN’T QUITE BACK IN REALITYAFTER ALL, OR IF I WAS, IT WAS A NEW, HYPERCHARGED ONE.I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE TO MEET MY GIRLFRIEND IN BERLIN THE NEXT DAY. IN THEMORNING MY TRAVEL AGENT CAME UP WITH AN AFFORDABLE LAST-MINUTE TICKET. ON THEPLANE, I SAT NEXT TO A GERMAN WOMAN DRESSED IN BLACK. I WAS READING THEINVISIBLE LANDSCAPE BY TERENCE AND DENNIS MCKENNA, AND I NOTICED SHE SEEMEDSTARTLED AFTER SHE READ A FEW WORDS FROM THE BACK COVER OVER MY SHOULDER. SHEHAD READ THE WORD SHAMANISM. HALFWAY THROUGH THE FLIGHT, SHE TOLD ME SHE HADBEEN HAVING A SERIES OF DREAMS OVER THE PAST MONTHS IN WHICH TWO AMERICANINDIANS, A COUPLE, CAME INTO HER HOUSE AND TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS MEANT TO BE ASHAMAN, THAT SHE WASN’T SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED. SHE WAS MEANT TO DEVOTE HERSELFTO SHAMANISM TOTALLY. THE DREAMS MYSTIFIED HER. SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUTSHAMANISM AND SHE HAD LITTLE IDEA WHAT IT WAS. “DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?”SHE ASKED.I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE BASICS OF SHAMANISM AND GAVE HER THE TITLES OF SOME BOOKSTO READ. ALSO I TOLD HER WHAT I BELIEVED, WHAT I HAD LEARNED FROM ROBERT: “THEINDIAN CULTURES HAVE BEEN ALMOST WIPED OUT, BUT SHAMANISM IS AN ESSENTIAL HUMANPHENOMENON CONNECTED TO THE EARTH. RIGHT NOW, THE SHAMANS OF THE PAST ARELOOKING FOR CANDIDATES WHO CAN CARRY ON THE TRADITIONS. THEY HAVE ZEROED IN ONYOU AS A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO FOLLOW THIS OR IGNORE IT, BUT IDEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU LEARN MORE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION.”THE WOMAN HAD A TRIBAL PENDANT AROUND HER NECK—ON IT WAS A PATTERN OFLIGHTNINGLIKE ZIGZAGS AROUND A CENTRAL CIRCLE—AND I ASKED HER ABOUT IT.“SOMEBODY GAVE THIS TO ME ON A BEACH IN MEXICO,” SHE SAID. “THEY SAID IT WAS ANAVAJO PROTECTION SYMBOL.”I DO NOT THINK THE WORLD IS ORCHESTRATED AS A PARANOID CONSPIRACY DESIGNED TOFIT MY WILDEST FANTASIES. YET I HAD AN INTUITIVE, UNCANNY SENSE THAT THIS SYMBOLHAD BEEN SENT TO ME—TO SHOW ME THAT I WAS BEING PROTECTED, SOMEHOW, THAT I WASBEING TAKEN THROUGH A PROCESS. EVEN THOUGH I WAS FREAKING OUT, I HAD TO TRUSTTHAT THE PROCESS WAS GOOD. IN SHAMANIC CULTURES, SYNCHRONICITIES ARE RECOGNIZEDAS SIGNS THAT YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH.I WAS IN BERLIN BECAUSE LAURA’S FATHER HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH CANCER. THE ENTIREFAMILY WAS ASSEMBLING FOR THE WEEKEND. BECAUSE LAURA WAS PREGNANT AND WOULDN’TBE ABLE TO TRAVEL LATER, SHE WAS STAYING WITH HER PARENTS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.WHENEVER I WAS LEFT ALONE, I FOUND MYSELF WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE AND MAKINGCONDUCTING GESTURES AGAIN. I WAS AFRAID I WAS TURNING INTO ANOBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE, BUT I COULD CONTROL THE GESTURES WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WEREAROUND. AT NIGHT, I BARELY SLEPT.WITH MY EYES CLOSED, I WATCHED VIVID IMAGERY UNFOLD IN LITTLE FILM LOOPS. I SAWA HUGE COLUMN OF FIRE SHOOTING UP FROM THE CENTER OF STONEHENGE. I ENVISIONEDMYSELF WALKING INTO THE FLAME COLUMN, BEING OBLITERATED AND SHOOTING UP INTOSPACE. THIS FELT SO GOOD THAT I DID IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. THEN I SAW THE SURFACEOF ANOTHER PLANET, COVERED IN CORAL AND SPONGELIKE GROWTHS. A SMIRKING ALIEN WASSTANDING NEXT TO ONE OF THE SPONGES, AND HE KEPT FLOWING THROUGH THE ORGANICFOLDS OF THE PLANT, THEN REASSEMBLING HIMSELF. HE AND THE PLANT WERE FUSED INMAGICAL SYMBIOSIS.FINALLY I FELL ASLEEP. I DREAMT OF A BOY STANDING IN THE WOODS, YELLING OVER ANDOVER AGAIN AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS: “LONG LIVE ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY!”ANOTHER NIGHT I HAD TWO EXTREMELY VIVID DREAMS IN WHICH I WAS PURSUED BY ABEARDED MAN. IN ONE DREAM I THREW A PARTY IN AN APARTMENT WHERE I ONCE LIVED.AGGRESSIVE STRANGERS SHOWED UP AND STOLE MY BOOKS FROM THE SHELVES. A BEARDEDMAN CAME UP TO ME.“I USED TO LIVE HERE,” HE SAID.“DO YOU WANT TO COME BACK?” I ASKED.“YES,” HE SAID.BACK IN NEW YORK, I STILL FELT VERY STRANGE—FIZZY AND NONORDINARY, WITH ABUZZING AROUND THE TEMPLES. IT WAS MY SECOND NIGHT AT HOME AND I WAS JET-LAGGED.TEN MINUTES AFTER I TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND GOT INTO BED, A LARGE MIRROR INTHE OTHER ROOM FELL OFF THE WALL AND LOUDLY CRASHED FACEDOWN ON THE FLOOR. ITDIDN’T BREAK.ALL NIGHT I DREAMT THAT THE BEARDED MAN WAS HITTING ME IN THE HEAD WITH A PILLOWOVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND LAUGHING AS HE DID IT. I TRIED TO HIT HIM BACK BUT MYSWINGS WERE FEEBLE MISSES.WHEN I AWOKE IN THE MORNING, FEELING GROGGY, I WENT TO GET A YOGURT FROM THEREFRIGERATOR. I OPENED THE TIGHTLY CLOSED SILVERWARE DRAWER AND REACHED FOR ASPOON. RIGHT UNDER THE SPOONS WAS A LARGE AND OMINOUS BUG. IT DID NOT LOOK LIKEA NEW YORK BUG AT ALL—IT WAS WINGED, HONEY-BROWN, WITH A LONG CURLY TAIL, AND ITQUICKLY WRIGGLED OUT OF SIGHT.I SCREAMED AND SLAMMED THE DRAWER SHUT.FUCK, I THOUGHT. THE DPT TRIP HAD UNLEASHED AN ANGRY POLTERGEIST IN MY HOUSE.HOW COULD THIS BE? I HAVE NEVER HAD A BELIEF OR EVEN THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST INPOLTERGEISTS OR THE OCCULT, BUT THE SIGNS COULDN’T BE MORE OBVIOUS. SUDDENLY IWAS IN THE MIDST OF SOMETHING FOR WHICH I HAD NO FRAME OF REFERENCE, NOPREPARATION. WHAT HAD I DONE? ONCE AGAIN, AS OFTEN BEFORE, I CURSED MYSELF FORMY FASCINATION WITH THESE CHEMICALS.I WALKED AROUND IN A PANIC. I WENT TO THE EAST VILLAGE AND SAT AT A CAFE. ON THEWAY I STOPPED IN A TIBETAN BUDDHIST STORE. I ASKED THE CLERK IF HE HAD ANYSYMBOLS OF PROTECTION, AND HE SOLD ME A SMALL METAL DORJE, THE TIBETAN LIGHTNINGBOLT SYMBOL USED IN MEDITATION. I STILL FELT FIZZY. I HAD A TINGLING AROUND MYLEFT TEMPLE AND MY LEFT HAND WAS BUZZING STRANGELY. CLUTCHING THE DORJE IN MYFIST, I CALLED CHARITY AND TOLD HER ABOUT THE SITUATION.“OH MAN,” SHE SAID. “WE’VE GOT TO CLEAN THAT THING OUT OF THERE BEFORE YOURGIRLFRIEND COMES BACK WITH THE BABY.”IT TURNED OUT THAT CHARITY, FROM HER DAYS OF SAN FRANCISCO WITCHCRAFT (MODERNPAGANISM WAS ANOTHER PHENOMENON I HAD ALWAYS DISMISSED), KNEW ALL ABOUTEXORCISMS AND ENTITIES. SHE HAD CARTED WITH HER, ALL THE WAY FROM MEXICO, ANENTIRE KIT BAG OF MAGICAL IMPLEMENTS, INCLUDING A LARGE AND BEAUTIFULLY SMOOTHBLACK OBSIDIAN BALL THAT SOMEONE IN PALENQUE HAD GIVEN HER AND SOME QUARTZCRYSTALS. WHILE I KNEW THAT QUARTZ WAS USED FOR SHAMANIC HEALING, TO REALIGNENERGY PATTERNS, I DID NOT KNOW THAT OBSIDIAN WAS CONSIDERED TO HAVE THE POWERTO ABSORB NEGATIVE SPIRITUAL ENERGIES. “THIS BALL IS SO EXCELLENT, IT JUST SUCKSALL THAT STUFF RIGHT UP,” CHARITY SAID. SHE ALSO BROUGHT CEREMONIALCANDLEHOLDERS (TACKY LITTLE SCULPTURES OF A CAT AND AN ELEPHANT, WHICH BECAMETHE EGYPTIAN GODS BAST AND GANESH FOR THE DURATION OF THE CEREMONY), ANDALEISTER CROWLEY’S ELEGANT TAROT CARDS. I MET HER AND WE WENT BACK TO THEAPARTMENT.“I CAN ALREADY FEEL IT,” SHE SAID WHEN WE WERE IN THE LOBBY. AND IT WAS TRUE—THEAIR IN THE BUILDING SEEMED ELECTRICALLY CHARGED, MORE SO IN THE ELEVATOR, AND INTHE APARTMENT, THE CHARGE WAS LIKE A DISTINCT PHYSICAL PRESENCE. CHARITY PUT THEOBSIDIAN BALL DOWN ON THE GROUND IN THE CENTER OF THE LIVING ROOM. WE BOTHWATCHED, ASTONISHED, AS IT TOOK THE BALL AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME TO STOPTREMBLING, FINALLY ROTATING IN SMALLER AND SMALLER CIRCLES UNTIL IT CAME TOREST. SHE ORGANIZED A QUICK MAGICAL RITUAL, CONSULTING THE TAROT CARDS SEVERALTIMES. I HAD ALSO NEVER GIVEN TAROT CARDS MUCH THOUGHT, BUT NOW I WAS WATCHINGTHEM AS IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT—I FELT, IN SOME OBSCURE AND WOOZY WAY, PERHAPSIT DID.SHE PICKED A CARD WITH LIGHTNING BOLTS ALL OVER IT, “SWIFTNESS.” “SO WE’LL BESWIFT,” SHE SAID. SHE PICKED “FORTUNE,” SUGGESTING A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. SHEPICKED “FUTILITY”—MY HEART SANK—BUT OPPOSITE IT, “THE QUEEN OF CUPS,” MY COURTCARD. “BECAUSE YOUR CARD IS A WATER SIGN, WE’VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH WATER,”SHE SAID, QUICKLY ANALYZING THE SITUATION LIKE A TECHNICIAN FACED WITH ANENGINEERING PROBLEM. SHE SOAKED THE OBSIDIAN BALL IN SALT-WATER, THEN HELD IT INTHE TOILET AND FLUSHED A FEW TIMES.“TAKE THAT BULLSHIT OUT OF HERE,” SHE COMMANDED.AT THE END OF THE RITUAL, THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE APARTMENT SEEMED CHANGED,CLEARED OUT. IT WAS, WE THOUGHT, SAFE AGAIN.IT WAS SAFE UNTIL LATER THAT NIGHT, WHEN I RETURNED FROM VISITING TONY. ONCEAGAIN, I FELT THE APARTMENT CRACKLING WITH AN ELECTRICAL OCCULT BUZZ. MY TEMPLEAND LEFT HAND STARTED BUZZING AGAIN. I HAD BEEN JOKINGLY COMPLAINING TO TONYABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL FORCES TAKING SUCH OBVIOUS MANIFESTATIONS—A FALLINGMIRROR, A BIG BUG. IT WAS ALL SO SILLY, SO COMIC BOOK–LIKE, EVEN FLIRTATIOUS.ONCE AGAIN, THE JOKE SEEMED TO BE ON ME AS I LAY IN BED AND FELT INCREASINGLYCREEPED-OUT AND PANICKED.I WENT INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND SAT IN FRONT OF THE OBSIDIAN BALL. I PICKED UPTHE DORJE AND CHANTED A BIT—NONSENSE WORDS, ASIATIC-SOUNDING, INSECTILE, SIMILARTO WHAT I RECALLED OF THE SECOYA LANGUAGE, CAME INTO MY HEAD AND I CALLED THEMOUT. “CHING! CHING! GADA-CHING! GADA-GADA-CHING!” I RAPPED THE HARD SURFACE OFTHE BLACK BALL WITH THE TIBETAN DORJE, THEN I HELD IT IN MY PALMS AND LOOKEDINTO THE POLISHED SURFACE OF THE OBSIDIAN SPHERE.MY ENTIRE VISUAL FIELD TURNED GRAY.ALL I COULD SEE WERE A FEW RECTANGLES OF REFRACTED LIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THEBALL; THICK GRAYNESS COVERED EVERYTHING ELSE.I TURNED AWAY FROM THE BALL AND LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM.AFTER TWO SECONDS, MY VISION WENT BACK TO NORMAL. I LOOKED BACK AT THE BALL.MY ENTIRE VISUAL FIELD TURNED GRAY YET AGAIN.I GRABBED MY JACKET AND RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE. ONCE IN THE STREET, I CALLED MYFRIEND MICHAEL FROM MY MOBILE PHONE. MICHAEL IS TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN ME; APOET AND NOVELIST WITH AN IMPRESSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALING ANDINDIGENOUS CULTURES; IT WAS HE WHO FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT AYAHUASCA. FOR AN HOUR,AS I PACED AROUND THE STREETS, MICHAEL TRIED TO CALM ME DOWN. HE TOLD ME SOMEBUDDHIST MEDITATION TECHNIQUES TO “GET YOU BACK IN YOUR BODY.” HE TOLD ME THATEVEN IF THERE WERE SOME “OTHER” OUT THERE, AND HE WAS NOT CONVINCED THERE WAS, IHAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT ASPECTS OF MY MIND HAD MANIFESTED ALL OF THIS STUFF. “ITTAKES TWO TO TANGO,” MICHAEL SAID. RATHER THAN FIGHTING AGAINST IT, I COULDACCEPT IT, INTEGRATE IT WITHIN MYSELF.MICHAEL TOLD ME TO IMAGINE A BUDDHA HOVERING OVER ME, SHOOTING PURE WHITE LIGHTTHROUGH MY BODY, TURNING ME INTO BLINDING WHITE LIGHT, FLUSHING EVERYTHINGNEGATIVE OR BAD INTO MY CENTRAL CHANNEL WHERE IT WOULD GO INTO MY INTESTINES ANDULTIMATELY COME OUT OF ME AS SHIT. AT THE END OF THE MEDITATION, MICHAEL TOLD METO IMAGINE THIS BUDDHA COMING DOWN TO ME AS I MERGED WITH THE WHITE LIGHT.I FOLLOWED HIS INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SEEMED TO HELP. I FELT SELFLESS, EMPTIEDOUT, AND EVEN EMPATHIC TOWARD MY ENTITY VISITOR. SOON I FELL ASLEEP. BY THE NEXTMORNING, THE WORLD HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL. THERE WAS NO MORE BUZZING, NO MORETRICKS.THIS STORY MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS, YET THE PSYCHIC REALITY OF THE DPT ENCOUNTER ANDITS AFTERMATH OVERWHELM MOST ORDINARY EVENTS. I OFFER IT AS A CAUTIONARY TALE.THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE STORY THAT REMAIN, FOR VARIOUS REASONS, IMPOSSIBLE TOTELL. SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT AFTER DPT, I STRONGLY SUSPECT AN ORDINARY DEATH ISNOT THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A HUMAN BEING. THERE MAY BE FAR WORSEFATES."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37NEW SENSATIONS[images/00006.jpg] FOR OVER A YEAR I HAD CAREFULLY STUDIED MY DREAMS, WAKINGTHREE OR FOUR TIMES A NIGHT TO WRITE DOWN IMAGES, CONVERSATIONS, DISJOINTEDNARRATIVES, AND SEMICONSCIOUS VISIONS. SOMETIMES, LYING IN BED ON THE THRESHOLDOF SLEEP, I WOULD SEE MYSELF AS A CORPSE DEVOURED BY BIRDS, OR I WOULD BEPROCESSED THROUGH SOME KIND OF COSMIC SAUSAGE-GRINDER. IN ONE DREAM I WASCRUCIFIED AND MY BODY PARADED THROUGH AN AFRICAN TOWN BY LAUGHING BWITITRIBESMEN. IN ANOTHER, I WAS GIVEN DIRECTIONS TO UNDERTAKE THE ALCHEMICAL “GREATWORK” IN AN AIRPORT LOBBY. MY DREAM LIFE CHANGED IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL. I WOULDFALL ASLEEP THINKING ABOUT SOME ESOTERIC CONCEPT, AND THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT IWOULD AWAKEN REPEATEDLY TO FIND MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND WAS STILL HOLDING THE IDEATIGHTLY, TURNING IT AROUND IN DIFFERENT WAYS. I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SLEEP CANBECOME AN EXTENSION OF WAKING AWARENESS, NOT JUST AN EXTINGUISHING OF IT.THE CHANGE IN MY DREAM LIFE SUGGESTED SOME KIND OF SHAMANIC OR ESOTERICINITIATION. IT FELT AS THOUGH THE IDEAS THAT FASCINATED ME WERE SLOWLY FILTERINGFROM MY THOUGHTS INTO MY BLOODSTREAM, PERMEATING MY CELLS. DESPITE THESE HINTS,DESPITE MY FASCINATION WITH THE SUBJECT, I ASSUMED THAT SHAMANISM WOULD REMAIN APHENOMENON “OUT THERE” THAT I WAS STUDYING, IN THE DISTANCED AND ANALYTICAL WAYI HAD ALWAYS PURSUED INTELLECTUAL SUBJECTS.ACCORDING TO GURDJIEFF, INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGE—TECHNICAL OR ACADEMIC MASTERY OFANY SUBJECT—IS ALWAYS SHALLOW AND ONE-DIMENSIONAL. “KNOWLEDGE BY ITSELF DOES NOTGIVE UNDERSTANDING. . . . UNDERSTANDING DEPENDS UPON THE RELATION OF KNOWLEDGETO BEING.” HE THOUGHT THAT ANCIENT CULTURES CARED ABOUT ONE’S QUALITY OF BEING,DEVELOPED THROUGH SELF-DISCIPLINE AND SPIRITUAL TRAINING, WHILE MODERN SOCIETYONLY VALUES WHAT IS QUANTIFIABLE: “PEOPLE OF WESTERN CULTURE PUT GREAT VALUE ONTHE LEVEL OF A MAN’S KNOWLEDGE BUT THEY DO NOT VALUE THE LEVEL OF A MAN’S BEINGAND THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF THE LOW LEVEL OF THEIR OWN BEING.” IF UNDERSTANDINGIS LINKED TO BEING, THEN CERTAIN TYPES OF PHENOMENA CAN ONLY BE COMPREHENDEDWHEN THE OBSERVER HAS CHANGED: “THERE ARE THINGS FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHICHA DIFFERENT BEING IS NECESSARY.” THIS TRANSFORMATIVE PROCESS TAKES PLACE INSTAGES, OVER TIME.IT IS HARD TO CALCULATE PRECISELY, BUT IN SMALL-SCALE TRIBAL SOCIETIES PROBABLYONE OUT OF EVERY TWENTY-FIVE OR THIRTY PEOPLE RECEIVES A SHAMANIC CALLING. SINCESHAMANISM SEEMS TO BE A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON, THIS STATISTIC SHOULD BECROSS-CULTURAL, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE AT LEAST TEN MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR CULTUREWHO POTENTIALLY FIT THE SHAMANIC ROLE. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLYALTERNATIVE HEALERS OF SOME SORT, SOME ARE ARTISTS OR PSYCHOLOGISTS, AND I HAVENO DOUBT THAT MANY OF THEM ARE IMPRISONED IN MENTAL HOSPITALS, OR THEY ARE AMONGTHE MUTTERING HOMELESS WHO REFUSE INTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY. WHETHER OR NOT THEYREALIZE IT, THEY ARE PEOPLE, LIKE MYSELF, FOR WHOM CONTACT WITH THE INVISIBLEWORLD IS AS ESSENTIAL AS ORDINARY KNOWLEDGE OR MATERIAL GAIN OR ANY REWARD THATTHE “REAL WORLD” CAN OFFER.THIS IS WHAT I SUSPECT HAPPENED WHEN I MADE MY ALLIANCE: A SOMEWHAT MISCHIEVOUSBEING FROM A HIGHER-VIBRATIONAL REALM MELDED ITSELF INTO MY CONSCIOUSNESS.FOR A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE EVENTS, I FELT THIS OTHER “IT” AS A NEW PERSPECTIVEINSIDE MY MIND. MY PERCEPTIONS SEEMED MORE ACUTE, MY THOUGHTS ZINGIER. THEREWERE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF REALITY THAT I SEEMED TO BE PICKING UP WITHOUT CONSCIOUSINTENT. FOR INSTANCE, WALKING AROUND THE STREETS OF NEW YORK I WAS CONSCIOUS OFTHE WAY SYMBOLS AND LOGOS IN ADVERTISEMENTS AND ON CLOTHES STOOD FOR UNCONSCIOUSFORCES, HOW THEY SHAPED AND MANIPULATED SOCIAL REALITY. ALL LOGOS, ALL SYMBOLS,SEEMED TO DRAW ENERGY FROM THE OCCULT DIMENSION, THE DPT REALM. EVEN WATCHING ABASKETBALL GAME ON TELEVISION BECAME UNBEARABLE—THE MANIPULATIONS WERE SOOBVIOUS. THE UNDERLYING MESSAGES—BEER FOR SELF-OBLIVION, JEEP FOR PLANETARYDESTRUCTION AND ACCELERATED EXTINCTION—SO MIND-NUMBINGLY CLEAR. POST-DPT, I HADTO OVERCOME A NEW SENSE OF CONTEMPT FOR HUMANITY, MYSELF INCLUDED, AS WELL AS ANINCREASED SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL.I STUDIED THE DPT REPORTS ON THE INTERNET WITH MORE CARE. SEVERAL OF THE DPTTAKERS ECHOED MY IMPRESSIONS: “I FELT AS IF DPT WERE A SINISTER, SINISTER BEINGTHAT WAS LAUGHING AT ME. HUMANS ARE SO WEAK. DPT DESTROYS YOU,” WROTE ONE OFTHEM. SOME WORRIED THAT THEY HAD TORN APART THE FABRIC OF REALITY: “IT’S VERYOBVIOUS THE HUMAN WORLD WAS AS STABLE AS A HOUSE OF TOOTHPICKS, AMAZING ITDIDN’T FALL APART SOONER IN HISTORY, BUT THE HIDEOUS HUMAN ANGEL HASN’T BEENCRAWLING ALONG THE PLANET THAT LONG AT ALL, AND NOW SOMEONE PULLED THE PLUG OUTACCIDENTALLY.” THIS WRITER ALSO PASSED, AT HIGH SPEED, THROUGH GOTHIC REALMSWHERE BEINGS APPEARED IN PARALLEL DIMENSIONS. MANY TAKERS OF DPT EXPERIENCE THECLASSIC RISING OF KUNDALINI ENERGY—THE HINDUS CALL IT SHAKTI—FROM THE BASE OFTHEIR SPINE TO THE TOP OF THEIR SKULL, SOMETIMES LEADING TO OUT-OF-CONTROL BODYSHUDDERS. UNSURPRISINGLY, DPT OFTEN SEEMS TO GENERATE AN EXTREME FEAR REACTION.AS NOTED EARLIER, RICK STRASSMAN THEORIZES THAT DMT, NN-DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE, ISTHE “SPIRIT MOLECULE” THAT RELEASES THE SOUL INTO THE SPIRIT REALM. IF THAT ISTHE CASE, I SUSPECT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DPT SERVES THE SAME FUNCTION IN SOMEOTHER REALM—THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD OF MAGICAL ENTITIES SKETCHED BY AUBREYBEARDSLEY AND DESCRIBED BY ALEISTER CROWLEY. PERHAPS DPT IS THE “DEMONMOLECULE,” RECOGNIZING THAT DEMONS ARE AMBIGUOUS ENTITIES IN MANY TRADITIONS. INTIBETAN BUDDHISM, ALL DEITIES HAVE BOTH THEIR BENEVOLENT AND WRATHFUL ASPECTS.THE WRATHFUL DEITIES IN TIBETAN BUDDHISM ARE DEPICTED AS FRIGHTENING MONSTERS,DRINKING BLOOD OUT OF SKULLS, MULTIARMED, WITH FANGS AND TALONS. AS THE FLIPSIDEOF THE BUDDHAS, AND ULTIMATELY ASPECTS OF THE INNER SELF, SUCH DEITIES CALL TOMIND AN OLD PROVERB: “THE DEVIL IS GOD AS HE IS MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE WICKED.”IN MAKING THIS ALLIANCE, IN THIS SPECULATIVE INTERPRETATION, NOT ONLY DID I HAVENO CONTROL ONCE THE PROCESS WAS SET IN MOTION, BUT THE ENTITY THAT INTEGRATEDINTO ME HAD LITTLE CHOICE IN THE MATTER AS WELL. “I” WAS SOMEHOW PART OF HISEVOLUTION, HIS INQUIRY, AS MUCH AS HE WAS PART OF MINE. OTHER FORCES WEREINVOLVED IN GUIDING THE MERGE, BUT DON’T ASK ME WHO OR WHAT THEY ARE. ASGURDJIEFF NOTED, “ALL THE PHENOMENA OF THE LIFE OF A GIVEN COSMOS, EXAMINED FROMANOTHER COSMOS, ASSUME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ASPECT AND HAVE A COMPLETELYDIFFERENT MEANING.” HE ALSO SAID: “THE MANIFESTATION OF THE LAWS OF ONE COSMOSIN ANOTHER COSMOS CONSTITUTE WHAT WE CALL A MIRACLE.”THERE MIGHT BE VALIDITY IN THE IDEA THAT THE DEMONS OR DJINNS “ARE ATTRACTED TOTHE MUSIC.” THE DISEMBODIED SPLENDOR OF THEIR HIGHER-VIBRATIONAL REALM MAY BORETHEM AFTER A WHILE. THROUGH COMMUNION WITH A HUMAN BEING, A SPIRIT FROM THESUPERSENSIBLE REALMS GETS TO SMELL, TASTE, LOVE, FUCK, ALL OUR SENSE-REALMEXPERIENCES. ON OUR SIDE, PERHAPS WE CAN UTILIZE SOME TINY ASPECT OF ITS HIGHERVISION AND ITS POWERS—I DON’T KNOW, AT THIS POINT, EXACTLY WHAT FOR, BUT PERHAPSTHAT REMAINS TO BE REVEALED AT SOME FUTURE POINT.IF THE UNIVERSE HAS A SPIRITUAL PURPOSE, PERHAPS THE SOUL DEVELOPS NEW POWERSAND POSSIBILITIES AS IT PASSES THROUGH VARIOUS INCARNATIONS THAT ARE STAGES INITS DEVELOPMENT. IN MY DREAM, THE DPT DEMIURGE CAME INTO MY HOUSE AND SAID TOME: “I USED TO LIVE HERE.” THERE WAS A STRONG FEELING OF FAMILIARITY TO THEEPISODE. PERHAPS, IN SOME PREVIOUS INCARNATION, CENTURIES OR EONS OR EVEN WORLDSAGO, WE ONCE MADE THIS SAME BARGAIN. THE INCUBUS’S MEMORY JUST HAPPENS TO BEBETTER, AND LONGER, THAN MINE.I ALMOST NEVER BUY CLOTHES, BUT ON THE PLANE TO BERLIN, I BEGAN TO SEE MYSELFWEARING A DEEP RED OR PURPLE VELVET VIVIENNE WESTWOOD SUIT WITH AN EDWARDIAN CUTTO IT. I THOUGHT HOW COOL-LOOKING AND COMFORTABLE SUCH A SUIT COULD BE, AND EVENSKETCHED MYSELF WEARING IT. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE MY NORMAL DRESSING STYLE. ON THEPLANE BACK TO NEW YORK I WAS REMINDED OF THE SUIT AGAIN. A WEEK LATER, IN SOHO,I HAPPENED TO WALK PAST THE VIVIENNE WESTWOOD BOUTIQUE. DOWN IN THE BASEMENTTHEY WERE HAVING A SAMPLE SALE. I FOUND ONE COPY OF THE EXACT SUIT I HAD BEENTHINKING OF, IN DEEP CRIMSON. I PUT IT ON. IT FIT. AT 70 PERCENT OFF, I COULDEVEN AFFORD IT."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38MAGICAL THINKING[images/00006.jpg] BEFORE TAKING DPT, I HAD STARTED TO REREAD CARLOSCASTANEDA’S BOOKS ON THE YAQUI SORCEROR DON JUAN. I ANTICIPATED WRITINGDISMISSIVELY OF CASTANEDA AS A PHONY ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO PERPETUATED A FRAUD. ASJAY COURTNEY FIKES WRITES IN CARLOS CASTANEDA, ACADEMIC OPPORTUNISM AND THEPSYCHEDELIC SIXTIES, “CASTANEDA’S CLAIMS THAT HE WAS A SORCERER’S APPRENTICE,AND THAT DON JUAN’S TEACHINGS CONSTITUTED A ‘YAQUI WAY OF KNOWLEDGE’ AREUNSUPPORTED BY PHOTOGRAPHS, FIELD NOTES, OR TAPE RECORDINGS.” FIKES BELIEVESCASTANEDA SIMPLY RECOGNIZED A GOOD MARKETING NICHE AND CASHED IN.AFTER DPT, HOWEVER, CASTANEDA’S DEPICTIONS OF THE SORCERER’S WORLD SEEMEDPLAUSIBLY INSIGHTFUL. DON JUAN EXPLORES TRICKS-OF-THE-EYE UNIVERSES, REALMS OFOTHERNESS REVEALED IN MIRROR-SCRATCHES OR THE SHADOW-THROWING FLICKERS OF CANDLEFLAMES. HE CONTACTS PARALLEL DIMENSIONS OF BEINGS AT ONCE EXTREMELY THREATENINGAND POWERFUL, YET EVANESCENT AND EPHEMERAL. DON JUAN’S SORCERY IS A DANGEROUSPURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SORCEROR CONSIDERS ULTIMATELY MEANINGLESS.“SEEING,” AS DON JUAN EMBODIES IT, REQUIRES DETACHMENT TOWARD ORDINARY REALITY.“A MAN WHO FOLLOWS THE PATHS OF SORCERY IS CONFRONTED WITH IMMINENT ANNIHILATIONEVERY TURN OF THE WAY, AND UNAVOIDABLY HE BECOMES KEENLY AWARE OF HIS OWNDEATH,” DON JUAN SAYS. “THE IDEA OF IMMINENT DEATH, INSTEAD OF BECOMING ANOBSESSION, BECOMES AN INDIFFERENCE.” THROUGH DPT, I SAW THE ROAD OPEN UP TOWARDAMORAL KNOWLEDGE AND OCCULT POWER. WHAT WAS MOST FRIGHTENING WAS ITSSEDUCTIVENESS, ITS NONHUMAN GLAMOUR.I COULD NO LONGER ARGUE WITH THE IDEA OF AMBIVALENT SPIRIT-REALMS CONJOINED WITHTHIS ONE. THE RULES OF NAVIGATING IN THESE REALMS MAY BE, AS DON JUAN LAYS THEMOUT, EXTREMELY SPECIFIC AND SEEMINGLY ARBITRARY. WITHOUT A GUIDE, THE DANGERSFOR THE INTEGRITY OF THE PSYCHE MAY BE AS IMPOSING AS THE KNOWLEDGE TO BEGAINED.POST-DPT, I TURNED TO THE OCCULT TRADITION OF THE WEST. IMPRESSED WITH CHARITY’SDEFT HANDLING OF THE TAROT, I FOUND MYSELF PEERING INTO THE HISTRIONIC WRITINGSOF ALEISTER CROWLEY. LIKE CASTANEDA, I CONSIDERED CROWLEY TO BE MERE ADOLESCENTENTERTAINMENT. ALAS FOR ME, I COULD NO LONGER DISMISS HIM SO EASILY. THE DPTJOURNEY, AND ITS AFTERMATH, SHOWED CROWLEY’S WORK, AND CASTANEDA’S, AS MORE THANSPOOKY FANTASY.CROWLEY’S SCHOLARLY PROJECT WAS TO FIND DEFINITE CORRESPONDENCES BETWEENMYSTICAL TRADITIONS, LINKING THE I CHING AND EGYPTIAN MYSTICISM AND THE TAROT.“THE LAWS OF MAGICK ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO THOSE OF OTHER PHYSICAL SCIENCES,” HEWROTE. HE LAID OUT A MODEL OF THE COSMOS WITH MANY HIGHER DIMENSIONS AND ENDLESSBEINGS INHABITING THEM, MADE OF SUBTLER STUFF THAN US. “IT IS ONE MAGICALHYPOTHESIS THAT ALL THINGS ARE MADE UP OF TEN DIFFERENT SORTS OF VIBRATIONS,EACH WITH A DIFFERENT VIBRATION, AND EACH CORRESPONDING TO A ‘PLANET.’ ” THISTHEORY—BASED ON THE SEPHIROTH, THE TEN EMANATIONS OF GOD IN THE KABALLAH—HAS ANEAT POETIC RESONANCE WITH MODERN “SUPERSTRING THEORY” IN PHYSICS, WHICHPOSTULATES TEN DIMENSIONS OF SPACE-TIME.IN THE 1920S, CROWLEY WROTE, “MAGICK DEALS PRINCIPALLY WITH CERTAIN PHYSICALFORCES STILL UNRECOGNIZED BY THE VULGAR; BUT THOSE FORCES ARE JUST AS REAL, JUSTAS MATERIAL—IF INDEED YOU CAN CALL THEM SO, FOR ALL THINGS ARE ULTIMATELYSPIRITUAL—AS PROPERTIES LIKE RADIOACTIVITY, WEIGHT AND HARDNESS.” CROWLEYCONSIDERED THE TAROT, BASED ON THE KABALLAH, TO BE AN ACCURATE MODEL OF THEFORCES AND SPIRITUAL HIERARCHIES AT PLAY IN THE UNIVERSE, A TOOL GIVEN TO US BYHIGHER-DIMENSIONAL FORCES.MOST PEOPLE IN THE MODERN WORLD REJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SELF MIGHT HAVEOCCULT AND TRANSCENDENTAL DIMENSIONS THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY OBSCURED BY ORDINARYLIFE. THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH KNOWLEDGE EXISTS, AND THAT YOU CAN RECEIVEDIRECT EXPERIENCE OF IT, THROUGH PSYCHEDELICS OR OTHER MEANS, IS UPSETTING, EVENFRIGHTENING. I NOW SUSPECT THAT THIS IS THE REASON THAT PSYCHEDELICS HAVE BEENSTRENUOUSLY SUPPRESSED BY MAINSTREAM SOCIETY AND REJECTED BY PSYCHIATRY. AS T.S. ELIOT WROTE, “HUMAN KIND CANNOT BEAR VERY MUCH REALITY.” WE HAVE CHOSEN NOTTO KNOW.ALL OF CARL JUNG’S RESEARCHES LED HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS AS IT WASREVEALED THROUGH PSYCHOANALYSIS HAD OCCULT AND PARANORMAL DIMENSIONS. FREUD,DESPITE HIS COURAGE AND BRILLIANCE, COULD NOT ACCEPT THIS POSSIBILITY. HE ONCECONFESSED TO JUNG, AS JUNG DESCRIBED IN THE UNDISCOVERED SELF, THAT IT WASNECESSARY TO MAKE A DOGMA OF HIS SEXUAL THEORY BECAUSE THIS WAS THE SOLE BULWARKOF REASON AGAINST A POSSIBLE “OUTBURST OF THE BLACK FLOOD OF OCCULTISM.” IN THESE WORDS FREUD WAS EXPRESSING HIS CONVICTION THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS STILLHARBORED MANY THINGS THAT MIGHT LEAD THEMSELVES TO “OCCULT” INTERPRETATIONS, ASIS IN FACT THE CASE. . . . IT IS THIS FEAR OF THE UNCONSCIOUS PSYCHE WHICH NOTONLY IMPEDES SELF-KNOWLEDGE BUT IS THE GRAVEST OBSTACLE TO A WIDER UNDERSTANDINGAND KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY. JUNG BELIEVED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT ACHIEVE TRUE AWARENESS WITHOUTEXPLORING THE OCCULT DOMAINS OF THE PSYCHE (WHICH DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE TOLITERALLY CONJURE UP DEMONS). HE LOOKED AT THE METAPHORS FOR THE QUEST FORSELF-KNOWLEDGE HIDDEN IN GNOSTICISM, AND IN ALCHEMY, WHERE THE INJUNCTION “VISITTHE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH” REFERRED TO TECHNIQUES OF SEEKING TRANSCENDENTKNOWLEDGE AND POWER BY DELVING INTO HIGHER STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS ANDINTEGRATING THEM INTO THE SELF.THE ROOTS OF EUROPEAN ALCHEMY CAN BE FOUND IN GNOSTICISM, A HERETICAL OFFSHOOTOF CHRISTIANITY THAT FLOURISHED IN THE FIRST CENTURIES A.D. THE GNOSTIC VERSIONOF CHRIST IS A LEARY-LIKE ADVOCATE FOR DIRECT SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE OVER FAITH.IN THE “GOSPEL OF THOMAS,” ONE OF A GROUP OF GNOSTIC TEXTS DISCOVERED IN A JARIN THE NAG HAMMADI DESERT AT THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, CHRIST SAID, “OPENTHE DOOR FOR YOURSELF, SO YOU WILL KNOW WHAT IS.” IN THAT SAME TEXT, WHICH MAYPREDATE THE BIBLICAL SCRIPTURES AND EQUAL THEM IN AUTHENTICITY, CHRIST ALSOANNOUNCED, “IF YOU BRING FORTH WHAT IS WITHIN YOU, WHAT YOU BRING FORTH WILLSAVE YOU. IF YOU DO NOT BRING FORTH WHAT IS WITHIN YOU, WHAT YOU DO NOT BRINGFORTH WILL DESTROY YOU.” EITHER OF THOSE PHRASES COULD STAND AS A PSYCHEDELICCREDO. WITH HIS VISIONS, HIS ABILITY TO TRANSFORM ENERGIES, AND HIS MASTERY OFHEALING, CHRIST COULD BE SEEN AS A PROTOTYPICAL SHAMAN. IN THE GOSPELS, CHRISTSAYS, “SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND.” THE UNSTATED COROLLARY TO THIS IS, IF YOU DONOT SEEK, YOU WILL NOT FIND.. . .THE HIERARCHIES OF INVISIBLE BEINGS I HAD SEEN ON DPT—AS IF I WAS A REFLECTINGSURFACE, A MIRROR FOR THEM TO PREEN THEMSELVES—NOW SEEMED TO BE PRESENTEVERYWHERE. WALKING IN A COMMUNITY GARDEN ON EAST HOUSTON STREET, FEATURINGFLOWERING PATHS AND A SMALL POND WITH TURTLES IN IT, I SAW EMANATIONS OF THATHIGHER-ORDER OCCULT DIMENSION IN THE SWOOPING FLOURISHES OF RARE FLOWERS, IN THEPSEUDOPSYCHEDELIC PATTERNS TRACED ACROSS A TURTLE’S SCALY SKIN. IT WAS SUDDENLYOBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE DARWINIAN THEORY OF EVOLUTION, THE WESTERN RATIONALPERSPECTIVE ON WORLD BIOLOGY, WITH ALL ITS FLAWS AND GAPS, COULD NOT BE THEWHOLE STORY. IT WAS TRUE TO A LIMITED EXTENT, BUT THERE WERE OTHER TRUTHS ASWELL. LIFE ON EARTH HAS BEEN SCULPTED INTO MULTITUDINOUS FORMS BYHIGHER-DIMENSIONAL BEINGS FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF THEIR OWN SKILL AND OUR DELIGHT.AS I WATCHED A TURTLE’S EYE ROTATE IN ITS SOCKET, I HAD TO ADMIT THAT THEY WEREMASTER CRAFTSMEN.AS I WAS READING ABOUT THE KABALLAH AND THE WESTERN OCCULT TRADITION, FEELINGOPPRESSED BY CROWLEY’S MANIACAL TONE, I RAN INTO AN OLD FRIEND WHO HAD MOVED TOSAN FRANCISCO AND WAS JUST IN TOWN FOR A FEW WEEKS TO CURATE A SHOW AT ADOWNTOWN GALLERY. I HAD KNOWN NEIL IN NEW YORK FOR MANY YEARS. WE HAD SHARED ANINSATIABLE APPETITE FOR PARTIES AND ART OPENINGS. OUR MUTUAL FRIENDS CONSIDEREDUS RIVALS FOR THE TITLE ROLE OF NEW YORK BON VIVANT.NEIL SEEMED ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED AFTER FIVE YEARS. TALL AND NARROW, HE WOREANTIQUE SUITS AND PATTERNED TIES, LOOKING A BIT LIKE AN ASCETIC MISSIONARY FROMTHE 1940S ON HIS FIRST TRIP INTO THE JUNGLE. IT TURNED OUT THAT NEIL HAD BECOMEDEEPLY INVOLVED IN STUDYING THE WORK OF RUDOLF STEINER. STEINER WAS ANAUSTRIAN-BORN PHILOSOPHER AND OCCULTIST FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, WHOCLAIMED TO HAVE DEVELOPED A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO STUDYING SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA.NEIL WAS EVEN LIVING IN A CHURCH FOUNDED UNDER STEINER’S GUIDANCE. I KNEWNOTHING ABOUT STEINER EXCEPT THAT HE HAD CREATED WALDORF SCHOOLS AND FOUNDEDSOMETHING CALLED ANTHROPOSOPHY.NEIL HAD RECEIVED AN INITIAL PUSH TOWARD MYSTICISM THROUGH PSYCHEDELICS. HEDESCRIBED A DMT TRIP FROM THE EARLY 1990S DURING WHICH HE SHUT HIS EYES ANDBEHELD A SIGHT WHICH ASTONISHED HIM: AN INFINITELY DEEP TUNNEL WHOSE GLOWINGWALLS WERE COVERED WITH CONSTANTLY CHANGING RUNIC SCRIPT AND VISUAL SYMBOLS.“THEN I BECAME AWARE THAT I WAS SURROUNDED BY SEVERAL GIGANTIC BEINGS WHO WEREGUIDING MY ATTENTION INTO THIS TUBULAR APPARATUS, WHICH THEY HAD BEEN PROPPINGUP IN FRONT OF MY FACE AS IF TO DISTRACT ME FROM THEIR ACTIVITIES. WHEN IDISCOVERED THEM HOVERING AROUND ME, THEY SMIRKED AND WINKED AT ME, PROBING INTOMY HEAD WITH THEIR FINGERS AS IF INSPECTING THE CONTENTS OF MY MIND. THEMASCULINE ONES LOOKED A BIT LIKE KING NEPTUNE, WITH LONG CURLY BEARDS, BUTHUNCHED OVER AND VERY EARTHY. THE FEMALES WERE ABSURDLY VOLUPTUOUS AND STRUGGLEDFOR MY ATTENTION WITH PLAYFUL ANTICS.”WHEN THE EFFECT BEGAN TO WEAR OFF, NEIL LIT THE PIPE A SECOND TIME. “AS I SATAND INHALED, I STARED INTO THE BURNING CHUNK OF DMT IN THE PIPE. WHEN I CLOSEDMY EYES, I WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE VIVID, LIQUID REALITY OFTHESE BEINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE RED GLOW IN THE PIPE HAD BECOME A MOLTEN SUNWITHIN THE MAGNIFICENT BOWL OF A MUCH LARGER PIPE BEING SMOKED BY ONE OF THEBEINGS. THEY WERE ALL SITTING WITH ME IN A CIRCLE, AND THE ONE WITH THE MAGICALPIPE OFFERED IT TO ME CEREMONIOUSLY. THEY COMMUNICATED THROUGH THESEIMAGE-TUNNELS, AND EACH HAD A UNIQUE PERSONA CONVEYED THROUGH THE QUALITY OFIMAGES WITHIN THEIR TUNNEL. I HAD THE DISTINCT FEELING THAT THEY WERE STARVEDFOR HUMAN ATTENTION AND WERE OVERJOYED THAT I HAD MADE THE JOURNEY TO THEM.ALTHOUGH I WAS AMAZED TO MEET THEM AND EAGER TO GRASP THEIR VISUAL DISCOURSE, IKNEW THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR MY PUNY INTELLECT.”WHEN THE TRIP SEEMED ABOUT OVER, HE LAY DOWN ON THE BED AND RECEIVED A FINALINTENSE FLASH. A FEMININE FIGURE APPROACHED HIM FROM ABOVE. SHE HELD A LUMINOUSTABLET FROM WHICH EMERGED A STREAM OF TRANSFORMING SYMBOLS: “THE MOTIFS OF ALLTHE WORLD’S CIVILIZATIONS FLOWED OUT OF HER IN AN ANIMATED TABLEAU—EGYPTIAN ANDBABYLONIAN FIGURES, NATIVE AMERICAN PATTERNS, EASTERN MANDALAS, HEBREW AND GREEKSCRIPT, A CRUCIFIXION SCENE, EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE. IT WAS WITH THIS THATI WAS WELCOMED BACK TO A COMPARATIVELY DRAB REALITY. OF COURSE, I WANTED TOUNDERSTAND MY EXPERIENCE. ALL MY PREVIOUS PSYCHEDELIC TRIPS HAD SHOWN ME THECREATIVE HANDIWORK OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD, THE SWIRLING PATTERNS AND WHATNOT.NOW I HAD MET THE BEINGS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!”AT AROUND THE SAME TIME, A MUSICIAN FRIEND TURNED NEIL ONTO ANTHROPOSOPHY. HERECOGNIZED THE BEINGS HE HAD MET ON DMT AS THE “ELEMENTAL BEINGS” DESCRIBED BYSTEINER IN NUMEROUS WORKS, PARTICULARLY HIS BOOK MAN AS SYMPHONY OF THE CREATIVEWORD. THESE NONPHYSICAL OR “SUPERSENSIBLE” BEINGS LIVE WITHIN THE PROCESSES OFNATURE AND HELP CONSTRUCT THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE. THEY ARE RELATED TO THE GNOMES,NYADS, DRYADS, AND SYLPHS SEEN BY COUNTRY FOLK THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND PRESERVEDIN MYTHS AND LEGENDS. FOR STEINER, THEY WERE PART OF A VAST ORDER OFSUPERSENSIBLE ENTITIES HE ENCOUNTERED THROUGH HIS OWN CLAIRVOYANT EXPERIENCES.“STEINER EXPLAINS HOW OPPOSING FORCES ACT ON HUMAN BEINGS ALL THE TIME,” NEILTOLD ME. “ONE OF THESE FORCES HE CALLS ‘LUCIFERIC,’ WHICH IS THE FORCE THATPULLS US AWAY FROM PHYSICAL REALITY UPWARD INTO DREAM AND FANTASY, VISIONARYREALMS, AND ABSTRACT THEORIZING. ACCORDING TO STEINER, LUCIFER IS NOT AN EVILBEING HIMSELF, BUT HE CAUSES EVIL TO OCCUR WHEN PEOPLE ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BELURED BY HIS OFFER OF INFLATED SELF-ESTEEM AND ESCAPE FROM THE RESPONSIBILITIESOF LIFE. THERE IS AN OPPOSING FORCE THAT PULLS US DOWN TOWARD THE EARTH,CHAINING US TO THE MINERAL REALM OF THE MATERIAL WORLD AND DEATH. THIS FORCE ISIDENTIFIED BY STEINER AS AHRIMAN, NAMED AFTER THE DARK EARTH-SPIRIT OF PERSIANLEGEND. IN ORDER TO BE TRULY HUMAN, WE MUST STRIVE TO ACHIEVE BALANCE BETWEENTHESE DIFFERENT FORCES. IT’S ONLY WHEN WE FIND THE CENTER THAT WE CANCONSCIOUSLY APPRECIATE THE EXTREMES. PSYCHEDELICS ARE HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARDTHE LUCIFERIC REALM, EXPANSIVE BUT ESCAPIST. THEY GIVE ACCESS TO WORLDS THAT YOUMAY BE EAGER TO SEE BUT MAY NOT BE PREPARED FOR.” NEIL COMPARED IT TO CRASHING APARTY, RATHER THAN WAITING TO BE INVITED.“DON’T YOU THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL?” I ASKED. “AFTER ALL, YOUPROBABLY WOULDN’T HAVE FOUND YOUR WAY TO STEINER IF IT WASN’T FOR PSYCHEDELICS.”“OBVIOUSLY THE DRUGS ARE HERE FOR A REASON, BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN THEY ARE GOODFOR US. THE BEINGS WE MEET ON PSYCHEDELICS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE OUR BESTINTERESTS AT HEART. I THINK THEY BENEFIT FROM OUR ATTENTION IN WAYS WE DON’TFULLY UNDERSTAND. THERE MAY BE A SORT OF ‘ORGAN TRADE’ GOING ON IN THESE REALMS.‘OH, HERE’S A LIVER I CAN USE!’ ALL SPIRITUAL TRADITIONS THAT I KNOW OF TEACHTHAT CROSSING THE THRESHOLD WITHOUT PREPARATION IS FRAUGHT WITH PERIL.” HEQUOTED A SONG BY THE BRITISH POSTPUNK BAND MAGAZINE: “MY MIND AIN’T SO OPEN THATANYTHING COULD CRAWL RIGHT IN.”I IMMEDIATELY STARTED READING STEINER’S WORK. STEINER EXPLAINS THAT DIFFERENTTYPES OF SPIRITUAL TRAINING WERE APPROPRIATE FOR DIFFERENT EPOCHS OF HUMANEVOLUTION. HE CALLED THE SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD AND THESHAMAN A “DUSK-LIKE CLAIRVOYANCE.” IN THE PRESENT WORLD, ACCORDING TO STEINER,THAT TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. HE DEVISED A METHOD OFSPIRITUAL TRAINING BASED ON MEDITATIONS AND COGNITION, USING THE HIGHLYDEVELOPED THINKING POWER OF THE MODERN MIND TO REDISCOVER THE LOST SPIRITUALREALMS. STEINER BELIEVED WE HAD DEVELOPED OUR MODERN EMPIRICISM IN ORDER TOREDISCOVER SPIRITUAL COGNITION IN FREEDOM—WITHOUT COMPULSION OR ATAVISM.ACCORDING TO STEINER, IN THE HIGHER REALMS, BEINGS ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM EACHOTHER AS THEY ARE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD: “TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF ASENSE-PERCEPTIBLE BEING MEANS TO STAND OUTSIDE OF IT AND ASSESS IT ACCORDING TOEXTERNAL IMPRESSIONS. TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF A SPIRITUAL BEING THROUGH HIGHERCONSCIOUSNESS MEANS HAVING BECOME COMPLETELY AT ONE WITH IT, HAVING UNITED WITHITS INNER NATURE.”THE HIGHER SPIRITUAL REALMS CONSIST OF BEINGS MADE ENTIRELY OF THOUGHT: “THEACTUAL WORLD OF THOUGHT IS WHAT PERVADES EVERYTHING IN THE LAND OF SPIRITS, LIKETHE WARMTH THAT PERVADES ALL EARTHLY THINGS AND BEINGS,” STEINER WROTE. “HERE,HOWEVER, WE MUST IMAGINE THESE THOUGHTS AS LIVING, INDEPENDENT BEINGS. WHAT WEGRASP AS A THOUGHT IN THE MATERIAL WORLD IS LIKE A SHADOW OF A THOUGHT BEINGTHAT IS ACTIVE IN THE LAND OF SPIRITS.”STEINER DESCRIBES A HIERARCHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS, FROM THE LOWEST PEBBLE TO THEHIGHEST SPIRITUAL BEING. ON EARTH, A PERSON WHO ACHIEVED TRULY RATIONALCONSCIOUSNESS (OF COURSE, FOR STEINER, RATIONALITY WOULD INCLUDE SPIRITUALAWARENESS) WOULD HAVE REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THOUGHT THAT WE CAN IMAGINE,WHILE MINERALS EXIST AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF MENTAL ACTIVITY (FOR MYSTICS, ITSEEMS THAT NOTHING, NOT EVEN A PEBBLE, IS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF CONSCIOUSNESS).IN THE HIGHER REALMS, YOU FIND BEINGS WHOSE LOWEST LEVEL OF EXISTENCE ISRATIONAL THOUGHT. WITHIN THIS MULTIDIMENSIONAL HIERARCHY, ELEMENTAL BEINGS RANGEFROM SUBPHYSICAL DEMONIC BEINGS TO EXALTED WORKERS SHAPING THE FORCES OFEXTERNAL NATURE. NEIL PARAPHRASED STEINER: “THE ELEMENTALS ARE HARD AT WORKKEEPING THE PLANET ALIVE, BUT THE ONES THAT GIVE US THEIR ATTENTION TEND TO BELESS CONCERNED WITH THE HEALTHY UNFOLDING OF HUMANITY THAN THEY ARE WITH THEIROWN DEVELOPMENT, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR OWN, AND THAT OFTHE EARTH.”NEIL HAD DOUBTS ABOUT THE PSYCHEDELIC COMMUNITY. “PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE LOWERREALMS OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD UNBIDDEN AND UNPREPARED, EXPOSING THEMSELVES TODELUSIONS AND DECEPTIONS. IN REALITY, THEY ARE PLACING THEIR FAITH IN THEMISCHIEVOUS IMPS OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. I HAVE NO DESIRE TO STOP ANYONE FROMPURSUING THEIR DESTINY, BUT THE SOUL-WRENCHING CHAOS OF THE PSYCHEDELICEXPERIENCE SEEMS TO LEND ITSELF TO A SENSE OF PANIC AND DISSIPATION. IF ONEWANTS TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE WORLD, INNER CALM AND DISCRIMINATION AREABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.”. . .IN 1997, LARGELY INSPIRED BY THE JEWEL-LIKE MULTICOLORED LANDSCAPES I BEHELDWITH EYES CLOSED ON SEVERAL MUSHROOM TRIPS, I DECIDED TO GO TO NEPAL. THEPRISMATIC FAST-CHANGING PSILOCYBIN SCENES SEEMED DIRECT EVOCATIONS OF “BUDDHAREALMS,” THOSE SUMPTUOUS PARADISICAL LANDS RULED BY ENLIGHTENED UNEARTHLYBEINGS, DESCRIBED IN MANY BUDDHIST TEXTS. AFTER A FEW VISITS, I FOUND MYSELFDRAWN TOWARD THE STYLIZED ARTIFACTS OF TIBETAN ART, THE THANGKA PAINTINGS ANDMANDALAS USED AS AID TO MEDITATION.WITH THE MONEY I MADE WRITING A NEVER-PUBLISHED ARTICLE ABOUT A HUMILIATINGVISIT TO A “FREE LOVE SUMMER CAMP” IN THE OREGON WOODS, I BOOKED A TICKET TOKATHMANDU, A CITY OF CRUMBLING HINDU TEMPLES, ANCIENT STONE STREETS, AND DIREPOVERTY. I THOUGHT, PERHAPS, THAT TIBETAN BUDDHISM MIGHT BE A PATH FOR ME. IVISITED SEVERAL TEMPLES AND MONASTERIES. THE SOLEMN RITUALS OF CHANTING MONKSAND THE STYLIZED SLOW-MOTION PAGEANTRY OF THE COSTUMED DANCES TO CELEBRATELOSAR, THE TIBETAN NEW YEAR, WERE BEAUTIFUL. BUT I DIDN’T LIKE THE HIERARCHICALAND NONDETACHED FEELING OF THE WESTERNERS WHO CLUSTERED CLOSE TO THEHIGH-POWERED LAMAS.FROM NEPAL, I WENT TO DHARMSALA, THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE DALAI LAMA AND TIBET’SGOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE, IN NORTHERN INDIA. I APPRECIATED THE SMILING FACES ANDEARTHY WARMTH OF THE TIBETANS, MONKS AND COMMONERS, BUT I WAS ONCE AGAIN PUT OFFBY THE GRASPINESS RADIATED BY THE WESTERNERS. I HAD PICKED UP A LUNG INFECTIONDURING A SHIVA FESTIVAL IN KATHMANDU—TO CELEBRATE SHIVA, THE CITY WITH THE THIRDWORST AIR QUALITY IN THE WORLD BURNED FIRES OF GARBAGE ALL NIGHT LONG—AND SPENTA WEEK COUGHING, WAITING FOR EITHER THE INDIAN ANTIBIOTICS OR TIBETANHOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES TO TAKE EFFECT.BY ACCIDENT, I WAS IN INDIA AT THE TIME OF THE HINDU FESTIVAL KUMBH MEHLA, WHICHIS IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS AS THE LARGEST GATHERING OF PEOPLE INTHE WORLD. EVERY THREE YEARS, AROUND TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE TRAVEL ACROSS THECOUNTRY TO BATHE IN THE RIVER GANGES ON ONE OF THREE AUSPICIOUS DATES. AT FIRSTI THOUGHT THE COMBINATION OF HINDU MOBS AND BAD SANITATION WOULD MAKE KUMBHMEHLA A TOURIST NIGHTMARE. FINALLY, SICK OF THE TIBETAN BUDDHIST CIRCUS, IDECIDED TO CHECK IT OUT.THE FESTIVAL TURNED OUT TO BE WELL-MANAGED AND ORDERLY, DESPITE ITS IMMENSITY.IT WAS A JOYFUL, ALMOST BIBLICAL, SPECTACLE. I STAYED IN RISHIKESH, A HOLY CITYOF PASTEL-COLORED ASHRAMS, THE PLACE WHERE THE BEATLES WENT IN THE SIXTIES TOSTUDY TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION WITH THE MAHARISHI. RISHIKESH WAS IDYLLIC ANDVEGETARIAN. CLANS OF HINDUS DRESSED IN BRIGHT COLORS AND FLOWING ROBES PARADEDCHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW, CARLESS STREETS. KUMBH MEHLA ALSO ATTRACTS SADHUSFROM ALL OVER INDIA; THESE YELLOW-ROBED, TRIDENT-CARRYING FOLLOWERS OF SHIVARANGE FROM SINCERE HOLY MEN TO SMIRKING SHYSTERS EAGER TO EXTRACT DONATIONS,PICK UP CHICKS, OR SELL GANGA TO TOURISTS. I STAYED AT A LAIDBACK ASHRAM FORWESTERNERS, RUN BY A BALD GURU IN HIS NINETIES. THE ASHRAM COST A DOLLAR ANIGHT, INCLUDING BREAKFAST, AND FOR ANOTHER DOLLAR YOU COULD ATTEND YOGA ANDMEDITATION CLASSES SPACED THROUGHOUT THE DAY. HINDUISM SEEMED SLOPPIER, MOREANARCHIC THAN TIBETAN BUDDHISM. HANGING OUT ON THE BANKS OF THE GANGES—CLEAN TOSWIM IN BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY TO ITS SOURCE IN THE HIMALAYAS—OLD HOLY MEN INLONG GRAY BEARDS WOULD COME UP TO CONVERSE WITH ME IN BROKEN ENGLISH ABOUT THENEARNESS OF GOD. WILD MONKEYS CHATTERED IN THE TREES. A PILGRIM IN THE STREETSSTOPPED TO TELL ME, SINCERELY, THAT HE WAS SURE WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER IN ANEARLIER LIFE.KUMBH MEHLA MARKS A MYTHOLOGICAL EVENT. LONG AGO, THE GODS WERE FIGHTING OVER AVIAL CONTAINING THE NECTAR OF IMMORTALITY. FOUR DROPS OF THIS NECTAR FELL INTOTHE GANGES AT THE FOUR SPOTS WHERE KUMBH MEHLA IS CELEBRATED. IF YOU BATHE INTHE GANGES DURING THE RIGHT MOMENT OF THE FESTIVAL, YOU WIPE AWAY THE BAD KARMA,LIKE A PSYCHIC CRUST, ACCUMULATED OVER ALL OF YOUR PAST LIVES.THE ACTUAL FESTIVAL WAS HELD, THAT YEAR, IN THE NEARBY AND EQUALLY FESTIVE TOWNOF HARIDWAR. ON THE AUSPICIOUS MORNINGS, HORDES OF DEVOTEES CLUSTERED FOR MILESUP AND DOWN THE RIVERBANKS. ON THE FIRST FESTIVAL DAY, I DID NOT ENTER THE WATERMYSELF, BUT I WITNESSED A RIOT OF THE NAGA BABAS. THE NAGA BABAS ARE THE MOSTEXTREME AND ASCETIC CLAN OF SADHUS. MOST OF THEM LIVE IN CAVES HIGH IN THEHIMALAYAS, COMING DOWN FOR THE FESTIVAL ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS. THEYPARADE—NAKED, CARRYING WEAPONS, COVERED IN GRAY ASH—THROUGH THE TOWN BEFOREBATHING IN THE WATER. THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY GURUS FROM ACROSS INDIA, ON CHARIOTS,SURROUNDED BY THEIR DISCIPLES. AMONG THE NAGAS, SELF-MORTIFICATION IS DERIGUEUR. AS THEY PARADED, I SAW THAT SOME OF THEM HAD CUT THE TENDONS IN THEIRPENISES TO PREVENT ERECTIONS. OTHERS KEPT ONE ARM RAISED IN THE AIR—THEY HADSTAYED LIKE THAT FOR YEARS, UNTIL THE APPENDAGE WAS THIN AND SHRIVELED. BYTRADITION, THE NAGAS ENTERED THE WATER FIRST, TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE HINDUHORDES. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY WERE RIOTING—IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEEXACT ORDER IN WHICH THEY WOULD ENTER THE WATER—BUT I WATCHED AS THOSE EMACIATEDMYSTICS PICKED UP LARGE ROCKS FROM THE STREET AND HURLED THEM INTO THE CROWDS.THEY CHARGED AROUND, MENACING THE POLICE WITH THEIR WEAPONS. I COWERED IN ARESTAURANT, WATCHING THE MELEE THROUGH THE METAL GRATE THE PROPRIETORS HADQUICKLY PULLED DOWN.FASCINATED BY KUMBH MEHLA, I DELAYED MY RETURN FLIGHT. I SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS INRISHIKESH, TRYING TO LEARN YOGA. ON THE NEXT AUSPICIOUS MORNING, I FOUND MYSELFLUCKILY WEDGED INTO THE CENTER OF HARIDWAR RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE NAGAS. THISTIME, AT THE RIGHT INSTANT, I JOINED THE JOYFUL MULTITUDES BOBBING UP AND DOWNIN THE CLEAR BLUE GANGES WATER.OF COURSE, AT THAT POINT, I DID NOT BELIEVE IN KARMA.. . .ALTHOUGH HE WAS AN ESOTERIC CHRISTIAN, STEINER BELIEVED, ALONG WITH HINDUS ANDBUDDHISTS, THAT HUMAN BEINGS PASS THROUGH MANY INCARNATIONS. HEALTH PROBLEMS ANDPERSONAL CRISES AND GOOD FORTUNE THAT MANIFEST ALONG THE WAY ARE THE RESIDUES OFONE’S FORMER ACTIONS, THE KARMA ACCRUED IN PREVIOUS LIVES. HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT,THROUGH SPIRITUAL TRAINING, IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMEMBER YOUR PAST INCARNATIONS,AS THE BUDDHA DID WHEN HE ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT, RECOLLECTING ALL OF HIS LIVESUP TO THAT INSTANT.“IT IS OFTEN ASKED WHY WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING OF OUR EXPERIENCES BEFORE BIRTHAND AFTER DEATH,” STEINER WROTE. “THIS IS THE WRONG QUESTION. RATHER, WE SHOULDASK HOW WE CAN ATTAIN SUCH KNOWLEDGE.” AT THE MOMENT MY PROVISIONAL BELIEF,STITCHED TOGETHER FROM BUDDHISM, WESTERN MYSTICISM, QUANTUM PHYSICS, ANDPSYCHEDELIC SHAMANISM, IS THAT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE AS THE “SELF” IS ACTUALLY AKIND OF VIBRATION OR FREQUENCY EMANATING FROM AN INVISIBLE WHOLE THAT EXISTS INA HIGHER DIMENSION. BUDDHISTS SEE THIS REALITY AS ILLUSIONARY SAMSARA; IT IS APRODUCT OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS, OUR KARMA. IF THE BUDDHISTS ARE RIGHT, THEN THEONLY WAY TO CHANGE THE WORLD IS TO TRANSFORM OUR CONSCIOUSNESS. PSYCHEDELICS AREONLY CATALYSTS FOR THAT DEEPER PROCESS OF INNER DEVELOPMENT.ACCEPTING STEINER’S IDEAS FOR A MOMENT, MY ACTIONS OVER THE LAST YEARS, HOWEVERMUCH THEY SEEMED SELF-WILLED AND HAPHAZARD, BEGAN TO REVEAL AN ESOTERIC LOGIC.AFTER KUMBH MEHLA, I WENT, DUE TO THE “LUCKY DRAW” OF A MAGAZINE ASSIGNMENT,THROUGH THE BWITI INITIATION IN AFRICA. THEN I DRANK AYAHUASCA WITH DON CAESARIOAND THE SECOYA. AFTER DPT, I WAS FORCED TO REVISE MY THOUGHTS YET AGAIN. ICONFRONTED THE AMBIGUITY, REALITY, AND POWER OF THE OCCULT ORDERS. THE DPT TRIPAND ITS AFTERMATH WAS BIZARRE, YET EERILY FAMILIAR. I FELT, I STILL FEEL, ASTHOUGH I HAD ACTIVATED SOME CIRCUIT OF NIETZSCHEAN “ETERNAL RECURRENCE,”RECOVERING SOMETHING I HAD KNOWN BEFORE.ACCORDING TO STEINER, ALONG WITH THE SELF THAT WE PERCEIVE IN DAILY LIFE, THEINTRACTABLE “I,” THERE IS ANOTHER SELF, A HIDDEN SPIRITUAL BEING, WHICH IS THEINDIVIDUAL’S GUIDE AND GUARDIAN. THIS HIGHER SELF IS THE DOUBLE, WHICH “DOES NOTMAKE ITSELF KNOWN THROUGH THOUGHTS OR INNER WORDS. IT ACTS THROUGH DEEDS,PROCESSES, AND EVENTS. IT IS THIS ‘OTHER SELF’ THAT LEADS THE SOUL THROUGH THEDETAILS OF ITS LIFE DESTINY AND EVOKES ITS CAPACITIES, TENDENCIES, AND TALENTS.”THE DIRECTION OF OUR LIFE IS SET OUT BY THAT OTHER SELF, A PERMANENT BEING THATCONTINUES FROM LIFE TO LIFE. “THIS INSPIRATION WORKS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEDESTINY OF ONE EARTHLY LIFE IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PREVIOUS LIVES.” THE PULLOF THESE FAR-FLUNG ARCHAIC RITES IN INDIA, GABON, AND THE AMAZON HAD EXERTEDSOMETHING LIKE A MAGNETIC ATTRACTION, AND SEEKING OUT THESE CONTACTS, I INTUITEDTHAT I WAS PRODDED ALONG BY THAT HIDDEN, HIGHER ASPECT OF MY BEING."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUETHE ANGEL OF HISTORYNOTHING BORES AN ORDINARY MAN MORE THAN THE COSMOS.—WALTER BENJAMIN[images/00006.jpg] IS HISTORY A PURPOSELESS MASS OF INCIDENT AND COINCIDENCE,OR IS THERE SOME DRIVING FORCE, SOME MEANING BEHIND IT—WHAT WALTER BENJAMINCALLED “THE ANGEL OF HISTORY” WATCHING OVER OUR STEPS?THIS BOOK CHARTS MY OWN GROPING-IN-THE-DARK PROGRESS, BASED ON A QUEST FORSELF-KNOWLEDGE USING PSYCHEDELICS AS TOOLS, FROM A NEO-FREUDIAN MATERIALIST ANDMECHANISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON REALITY TO ONE THAT IS JUNGIAN, GNOSTIC/BUDDHIST,OUTRAGEOUSLY MYSTICAL. MY VIEW OF HISTORY HAS CHANGED ACCORDINGLY. IT NOW SEEMSTO ME THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS BEING PROPELLED LIKE A PING-PONG BALL THROUGH ANEVOLUTIONARY WIND TUNNEL BY FORCES NOT ENTIRELY BUT LARGELY OUTSIDE OF OURCONTROL. THESE FORCES HAVE BEEN CALLED SPIRITS, GODS, DEMONS, DEMIURGES,DISINCARNATE ENTITIES, AND A HOST OF OTHER NAMES.

YOU CANNOTLIFT YOUR HAND WITHOUT INFLUENCING AND BEING INFLUENCED BY HORDES. THE VISIBLEWORLD IS MERELY THEIR SKIN. IN DREAMS WE GO AMONGST THEM, AND PLAY WITH THEM,AND COMBAT WITH THEM. THEY ARE, PERHAPS, HUMAN SOULS IN THE CRUCIBLE—THESECREATURES OF WHIM.”YES IT IS RIDICULOUS, BUT HERE IT IS: I HAVE HAD THE CLASSIC SPIRITUALAWAKENING, CATALYZED BY USE OF PSYCHEDELICS, THOSE BLIGHTED CHEMICALS THATSYMBOLIZE THE CRUSHED HOPES OF A FAILED ERA. I HAVE BECOME A “CRAZY FOOL,” ONEOF “THEM,” THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN DISCARDED BY THIS WORLD, WHOSE VISIONS AREGREETED WITH MOCKERY, DISMISSAL, OR FEAR. AND I AM MUCH HAPPIER FOR IT.ONE RESULT OF MY RESEARCH IS THAT I NOW FEEL STRANGELY IMPERSONAL—AN AGE-OLDRESULT OF THE INFLUX OF INFORMATION THAT IS PART OF THE AWAKENING OF THE SPIRIT.I SUSPECT THAT I, THIS IMPROBABLE PINCHBECKIAN IMPOSTER, THIS RAG DOLL OF FLESHAND FLAPDOODLE, ARRIVED HERE TO CONTINUE THE ANCIENT SPIRITUAL WORK OF MYUNKNOWN ANCESTORS—KABBALISTS ON ONE SIDE, DRUIDS ON THE OTHER—AND, IF SUCHTHINGS EXIST, PREVIOUS INCARNATIONS. THE INHERITOR OF UNTOLD GENERATIONS OFMYSTICAL YEARNINGS, OF CHANTINGS IN DARK CAVES AND AROUND STONE CIRCLES, OFEXILES AND LONG PILGRIMAGES ACROSS STARRY DESERTS, I AM NO LONGER JUST MYSELF—IAM SOMETHING OTHER AND OLDER, THE ARCHETYPAL OUTSIDER, THE ARCHAIC WAYFARER OFMYTHS AND LEGENDS. OF COURSE I LACK ANY HARD EVIDENCE FOR THIS; YET I INTUIT ITAS UNFATHOMABLE TRUTH, AS PIECES OF MY PRIVATE PUZZLE. EVERY TIME I DRINKAYAHUASCA—TO ME THE MOST PROFOUND AND HEALING OF ALL THE MIND-EXPANDERS FOUND INPOTIONS AND HERBS AND PILLS—I AM IN TOUCH WITH THAT ANCIENT AND QUESTING PART OFMYSELF, THAT STRAND OF CHILDLIKE WONDER TWISTED AROUND MY SOUL LIKE A JUNGLEVINE.I AM WRITING THIS TRUTHFULLY, YET PART OF ME RECANTS, DOESN’T ACCEPT, SINCERELYHOPES TO REJECT THE WHOLE TANGLED ARGUMENT AND RETURN, TAIL BETWEEN LEGS, TO THECONSENSUAL, DAILY-NEWSPAPER VIEW THAT IS, I KNOW, HOPELESS AND DERANGED IN ITSONE-DIMENSIONAL PORTRAIT OF A DOOMED WORLD, YET ODDLY COMFORTING IN ITS FLATCERTITUDES. I AM SICK OF FINDING MYSELF FLUTTERING, LIKE SOME UNWIELDYALBATROSS, FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE MARGINS OF THE MAINSTREAM.THE NATURE OF REALITY IS SPIRITUAL, NOT PHYSICAL. EVERYTHING WE SEE AROUND US ISANIMATED BY SENTIENT ESSENCES, DAINTY SUB-PLANCK-LENGTH FLIMMERS OF COSMIC WIT:PLANT SPIRITS, SYLPHS AND DRYADS, THUNDER BEINGS, TWISTED GENIES OF NATIONALISTFERVOR, PREDATORY DEMONS OF CORPORATIONS UNLEASHING NEW CHEMICALS (TERRIFYING TOENVISION THE MALFORMED AND ENRAGED ASURAS OF ASPARTAME, OLESTRA, MALATHION),ASTONISHING DEVIL EMPIRES REVEALED BY BRAND-NEW TRYPTAMINES. THE EARTH ITSELF ISA SPIRITUAL BEING THAT FORMED US OUT OF MUD AND DNA TO ACHIEVE ITS OWN DESTINY.SINCE THE INDIANS ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE SHAMANIC COSMOS, I AM WARY OF THE GLOOMYINDIAN PROPHECIES, CONSISTENT IN THEIR VISION OF IMMINENT HISTORICAL BREAKDOWNAND UNLEASHED HORRORS AHEAD—NATURAL CATASTROPHES, NUCLEAR WIPEOUTS, BIOCHEMICALASSAULT, MELTED ICE CAPS, POLAR SHIFTS—NOW APPROACHING US AT HIGH SPEED. THEDESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER MAY TURN OUT TO BE A PRELUDE OR BIRTHPANG, FIRST IN A SERIES OF CONVULSIONS, BEFORE MODERN CIVILIZATION IS EXPUNGEDFROM THE PLANET AND FORGOTTEN FOREVER, UNLESS THERE IS A QUICK AND UNLIKELYREVERSAL OF CURRENT TRENDS.THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MODERN HUMANITY AND THE PLANETARY CRISIS MIRROR EACH OTHER.HUMANITY IS STARING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE, THE OZONE HOLE, ONTO AN INCREASINGLYDEGRADED PLANET AND ITS OWN SHORTSIGHTEDNESS. ADDICTED TO OIL AS IF IT WERECRACK, WE ARE CHOPPING DOWN THE WORLD’S TROPICAL FORESTS AT AN ASTOUNDINGRATE—AS MUCH AS 1 OR 2 PERCENT A YEAR. WHEN MODERN CIVILIZATION FINISHESDRAINING THE WORLD’S RESOURCES, WHEN THIS HOUSE OF CARDS COLLAPSES, WE WILL SEEOURSELVES STRIPPED DOWN TO OUR ESSENCE AND WHIMPER FOR FORGIVENESS LIKETHIRD-GRADE BULLIES CAUGHT BY OUR TEACHERS, UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT WENTWRONG. AGAINST THE FLOODS, GENETIC POLLUTION, BACTERIAL ONSLAUGHTS, RADIOACTIVEINFERNOS UNLEASHED BY HUMAN STUPIDITY OR AGGRIEVED NATURE, OUR TECHNOLOGIES WILLPOP LIKE TOY GUNS. WATCH THE FUN AS THE STOCK MARKETS CONTINUE TO SEEK PROFIT,DOWN TO THE LAST SECONDS OF RECORDED HISTORY, BETTING ON THE MARGIN-CALLS OFDISASTER RELIEF AND REINSURANCE AGENCIES.WHAT IS “PROFIT” ANYWAY? WHAT IS THE GREED THAT IS MOTIVATING A FRENZIEDHUMANITY TO DESTROY THE PLANET AND DEGRADE ITSELF? IF A MEDIA MOGUL POCKETS SOMANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR WHILE LEAVING HIS CHILDREN ANDGRANDCHILDREN A WORLD WITHOUT CLEAN AIR, AMAZONIAN JUNGLES, THE PURPLE SPLENDOROF CORAL REEFS, OR ANIMALS, WHERE IS HIS PROFIT? IF A CHEMICAL CORPORATIONPROFITS BY SPREADING TOXINS ACROSS THE GLOBE THAT WILL REMATERIALIZE AS CANCERIN THE FLESH OF THEIR OWN ANXIOUS STOCKHOLDERS, WHERE IS THE PROFIT? TO WHATMARTIAN RETREAT OR LUNAR CLUB MED DO THESE MADMEN—OURSELVES!—SEE THEMSELVESRETREATING WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED FUCKING THIS PLANET LIKE AN OLD WHORE?MODERN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT IS A VERY RECENT DEVELOPMENT. THE UNDERLYING LOGIC OFCAPITALISM IS TIED TO MATERIALIST EMPIRICAL CONVICTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OFREALITY THAT HAVE, IN FACT, ALREADY BEEN OUTMODED. PHYSICS HAS BEEN FORCED TORECOGNIZE AN INEXTRICABLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBJECT AND OBJECT, OBSERVED ANDOBSERVER, CONSCIOUSNESS AND COSMOS. AS DR. STANISLAV GROF WRITES IN BEYOND THEBRAIN: SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN CONTEMPORARY MEDICINE, PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHOLOGY, ANDANTHROPOLOGY REPRESENTS A DIRECT EXTENSION OF THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURYNEWTONIAN-CARTESIAN MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE. SINCE ALL THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OFTHIS WAY OF VIEWING REALITY HAVE BEEN TRANSCENDED BY TWENTIETH-CENTURY PHYSICS,IT SEEMS ONLY NATURAL TO EXPECT PROFOUND CHANGES SOONER OR LATER IN ALL THEDISCIPLINES THAT ARE ITS DIRECT DERIVATIVES. DESPITE ITS NARROW-MINDED BELIEF IN ITS OWN MASTERY, WESTERN MATERIALIST SCIENCECANNOT COMPREHEND THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. CONSCIOUSNESS MAY BE MUCH MORE ANINTRINSIC PROPERTY OF MATTER AND LIVING CELLS THAN WE HAVE DARED TO LETOURSELVES IMAGINE.ASTONISHING EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE WITH PLANTS AND POLYGRAPH MACHINES. LIEDETECTORS WIRED TO PLANTS HAVE SHOWN, THROUGH AN INCREASE IN ELECTRICALIMPULSES, THAT PLANTS WERE AWARE OF WHO STOOD IN THE ROOM WITH THEM, AND WHATTHE INTENTIONS OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE TOWARD THEM. EVEN BEFORE AN EXPERIMENTERCOULD CUT OFF A PLANT’S LIMB, WHEN THE SEVERING WAS JUST AN IDEA HELD IN THEIRMIND, THE TARGETED PLANT WOULD BEGIN TO REGISTER FRANTIC DISPLEASURE.WHAT IF PLANTS ARE, AT SOME LEVEL, CONSCIOUS?EVERY TIME I TAKE MUSHROOMS OR LSD, I FEEL A CHEERFULLY NUTTY BUT INTUITIVECERTAINTY THAT TREES ARE WATCHERS, PLANTS ARE SENTIENT BEINGS, PATIENTLY AWAREOF THEIR PLACE IN THE ULTIMATE SCHEME OF THINGS—OF COURSE, THIS COULD BE ADELIGHTFUL FORM OF DRUG-INDUCED PARANOIA. FOR THE INDIANS, OF COURSE, PLANTS ARESPIRITUAL BEINGS JUST AS MUCH AS WE OURSELVES; THEY ARE OUR FELLOW TRAVELERS ANDPARTNERS. PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS ARE PARTICULAR EMISSARIES FROM THE “GREEN NATION”WHO HAVE DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO SHARE THEIR WISDOM WITH HUMAN BEINGS.WHAT ELSE MIGHT SHARE CONSCIOUSNESS WITH US?WHAT IF EVERYTHING DOES?I HAVE HEARD FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE OF ONE EXPERIENCE THEY HAD WHILE SMOKING THEFORTIFIED LEAVES OF SALVIA DIVINORUM, A PROFOUND AND EERIE ALTERATION OF SELFTHAT LASTS ALL OF FIVE MINUTES, IN WHICH THEY DISSOCIATED, THEN REALIZED THEYWERE EXPERIENCING THE WORLD AS AN INANIMATE OBJECT—A WINDOW, WOOD FLOORBOARD,VINYL CUSHION, COUCH, OR TELEVISION SET. “SUDDENLY I WAS THE WINDOW IN MY LIVINGROOM,” ONE FRIEND TOLD ME. “I WAS LOOKING OUT INTO THE STREET AND THEN BACK INTOMY ROOM AT MYSELF SITTING THERE. THAT WAS ALL I COULD DO.”HOW COULD A FEW SMOKED LEAVES OF A PLANT CAUSE SUCH AN EFFECT? COULD IT BE, ASBIOLOGISTS STRIVE TO SEE ALL MENTATION, SIMPLY A PHYSICAL ACTION OF THE BRAIN?WHAT IF, INSTEAD, EVERYTHING THAT WE CREATE TAKES ON, IN SOME PERPENDICULARDIMENSION, A PSYCHIC REALITY AND SENTIENT AWARENESS OF ITS OWN?OTHER REPORTS OF SMOKED SALVIA TRIPS ARE EQUALLY JARRING BUT UTTERLY DIFFERENT.DANIEL SEIBERT, THE RESEARCHER WHO ISOLATED SALVINORIN A, THE ACTIVE COMPONENTOF SALVIA, ACCIDENTALLY TOOK A MASSIVE OVERDOSE OF THIS SUBSTANCE (HE DID NOTIMAGINE THAT, LIKE LSD, SALVINORIN A COULD BE ACTIVE IN MICROGRAMS) AND FOUNDHIMSELF A GHOST VISITOR TO HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD HOMES, PASSING THROUGH THEM ONEAFTER ANOTHER. “THE HOUSES WERE COMPLETELY DETAILED AND REAL,” HE RECALLED. “ICOULD WALK AROUND, OPEN CLOSETS OR DRAWERS AND SEE ALL THE STUFF EXACTLY AS ITHAD BEEN.” SEIBERT AND OTHERS ALSO REPORT ENTERING STRANGE SALVIA REALMS WHEREEVERYTHING AROUND THEM HAS NOT CHANGED EXCEPT THAT THE WORLD IS SUDDENLY MADEENTIRELY OUT OF STACKS OF COINS OR PEBBLES—SOME ELEMENT OF THE MATERIAL WORLDREPLICATING ITSELF LIKE THREE-DIMENSIONAL WALLPAPER OR TILING, A KIND OFHOLOGRAPHIC NIGHTMARE.SUCH AN IDEA—THAT EVERYTHING WE CREATE ACQUIRES SOME KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS—ISNOT THAT FAR AWAY FROM CERTAIN CONCEPTS IN SOCIAL THEORY, SUCH AS MARX’S NOTIONOF THE FETISH CHARACTER OF COMMODITIES, WHICH ACT WITHIN MARKETS AS IF THEY HADWILLS OF THEIR OWN. AS WALTER BENJAMIN ONCE NOTED, “IN THE END, THINGS AREMERELY MANNEQUINS, AND EVEN THE GREAT MOMENTS OF WORLD HISTORY ARE ONLY COSTUMESBENEATH WHICH THEY EXCHANGE GLANCES OF COMPLICITY WITH NOTHINGNESS, WITH THEPETTY AND THE BANAL.”WHEN YOU TAKE PSYCHEDELICS, AFTER THE INITIAL FEAR AND PAST THE STAGE OFPSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSING, YOU SOMETIMES REACH A CALM PLACE WHERE METAPHYSICALCONCEPTS ARISE, SEEMINGLY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD. THESE SELF-ORGANIZING STRUCTURESOF POSSIBILITY FLOAT TO THE SURFACE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE THEY OPEN LIKE FLORALBOUQUETS. ON AYAHUASCA, I HAVE HAD THE THOUGHT THAT THE JUNGLE IS NATURE’S FREESPACE FOR CREATIVITY, WHERE NEW LIFE FORMS ARE BRED AND RELEASED AS POETICEXPERIMENTS—WHICH IS WHY IT FEELS SO SACRED. CHILDREN INTUIT ITS SACREDNESSWITHOUT EVEN GOING THERE—FROM A FEW PICTURES IN BOOKS OR SOME TELEVISION IMAGES.THE NEXT THOUGHT TO OPEN WAS THAT WE, HUMAN BEINGS, WERE ALSO LOVED, BY ALL THEUNKNOWN SWARMS AND MANIFOLD PHALANXES OF SENTIENT ENTITIES BEYOND THE REALM OFTHE SENSIBLE, FOR OUR OWN CREATIVE EFFORTS, NO MATTER HOW MASS-PRODUCED,ILL-CONCEIVED, OR HALF-FORMED THEY MAY BE. WE ARE LOVED FOR OUR CREATIVITY,WHICH IS A KIND OF INFINITE POTENTIAL.IT IS A PECULIAR FACT NOTED BY THEORISTS OF EXTRADIMENSIONAL PHYSICS: ONLY INTHREE DIMENSIONS CAN THERE BE SUCH A THING AS A KNOT. KNOTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE INTWO DIMENSIONS, AND EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE IN ANY OF THE HIGHER REALMS, THETESSERACT- AND CALIBI-YAU–SHAPED RUBIK PUZZLES, OF HYPERSPACE. PERHAPS WE,TEMPORARILY EMBODIED, TRAPPED, IN THIS REALITY, ARE LIKE THE KNOTS OF PHYSICALFORCES, HOLDING THE COSMOS IN PLACE.“AS I SEE IT,” JUNG WROTE IN HIS MEMOIRS, “THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD IN TIMEAND SPACE IS LIKE A SYSTEM OF COORDINATES; WHAT IS HERE SEPARATED INTO ORDINATESAND ABSCISSAE MAY APPEAR ‘THERE,’ IN SPACE-TIMELESSNESS, AS A PRIMORDIAL IMAGEWITH MANY ASPECTS, PERHAPS AS A DIFFUSE CLOUD OF COGNITION SURROUNDING ANARCHETYPE.” THIS WOULD HAVE SEEMED NONSENSE TO ME A FEW YEARS AGO, BUT I HAVESEEN, IN RAINBOW SHIMMERS OF AYAHUASCA VISIONS, AND THROUGH THE MORE TRAUMATICTRANSPORTATION DEVICE OF DMT, THAT IT MAY BE TRUE.THE SHAMANIC ANTIPODES OF THE KNOWN AND FAMILIAR AND SEEMINGLY RATIONAL HAVETHEIR OWN VAUDEVILLIAN LOGIC. WHAT IS ALMOST MOST DISCONCERTING ABOUT THE OTHERDIMENSIONS IS THIS: AFTER YOU HAVE RISKED YOUR SANITY, THE DISAPPROVAL OFFRIENDS AND FAMILY, TO GET THERE, YOU FIND, AMID THE SHARDS OF PROPHECY ANDMYTH, THE REVELATIONS OF TERROR AND UTOPIAN BLISS, A LOVE OF BIZARRE LOW-BROWCOMEDY, TWO-BIT PUNS, TINPLATE STEREOTYPES, AND CARTOON SHTICK. THE JOKE IS ONEMASK THAT THE UNKNOWN, THE OTHER, WEARS TO CONCEAL ITSELF, TO KEEP ITSELF BEYONDTHE GRASP OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE SHAMAN’S MOST EFFICIENTTOOLS IS LAUGHTER, WHICH, WIELDED WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF A SURGEON’S SCALPEL,BRUSHES THE MIND SHADOWS AWAY.OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS, I FOUND, IN MY DREAMS, I WAS GETTING THEMESSAGE, AGAIN AND AGAIN, TO TAKE MORE—AND MORE—PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS. AT PARTIES,GROOVY GUYS IN SUNGLASSES WOULD COME OVER TO OFFER ME DMT. IN A STRANGE CITY, IWAS LED TO AN UNDERGROUND DRUG COUNTER WHERE I COULD BUY MIND-ALTERING COMPOUNDSFROM OVERLY SOLICITIOUS CLERKS. AN OLD FRIEND OFFERED ME KETAMINE DURING ACENTRAL PARK SOFTBALL GAME. I FOUND LITTLE WHITE DOUGHY PASTRIES FULL OF ECSTASYFOR SALE AT THE LOCAL DELI, THEN COMMERCIAL PACKAGES OF “MAGIC MUSHROOMS” IN AMEXICO CITY SUPERMARKET. DPT MADE A DISGUISED APPEARANCE ALSO. AT A FANCYMIDTOWN RESTAURANT, THE WAITER OFFERED ME THE DAILY SPECIAL: 300 TINY DIABOLICALCREATURES IN A SAUCE. SENSIBLY, I DECLINED. THERE WAS A KIND OF LURIDVAUDEVILLIAN URGENCY TO THE WAY THE DREAM-FIGURES KEPT PUSHING ME TO FURTHER,AND FASTER, EXPLORATION.I DIDN’T GET IT. DID SOME FRISKY ASPECT OF MY UNCONSCIOUS WANT ME TO EXPAND MYPSYCHE IN MORE DIRECTIONS? WAS THIS A HEALTHY IMPULSE? FINALLY, AS I BEGAN TOSUSPECT THERE MIGHT BE A SPIRIT WORLD SPINNING AROUND AND SUFFUSING OUR PHYSICALREALM, I WONDERED IF THESE OFFERINGS WERE BEING MADE BY AMBIGUOUS OR OMINOUSFORCES WHO DID NOT HAVE MY BEST INTERESTS AT HEART. PERHAPS THEY WERE LURING MEON TOWARD OVERUSE AND SELF-DISINTEGRATION. PERHAPS, AS DR. STRASSMAN WAS TOLDDURING HIS DMT TRIALS, THEY WANTED TO USE ME TO GET INTO THIS WORLD.CLEARLY, PSYCHEDELICS ARE AMBIGUOUS TOOLS. BUT ALL TOOLS ARE AMBIGUOUS. THETOOLS OF SCIENCE CAN BE USED TO WEAPONIZE ANTHRAX OR SMALLPOX, TO RING THE WORLDWITH NUCLEAR WARHEADS, TO TURN AN OPEN SOCIETY INTO A PARANOID DISTOPIA OFTELESURVEILLANCE. PSYCHEDELICS PROVIDE AN ACCELERATED METHOD FOR EXPLORING WHATHUXLEY CALLED THE “FAR ANTIPODES” OF THE MIND. MEDITATION, LUCID DREAMING, ORGURDJIEFF’S SYSTEM OF “SELF-REMEMBERING” ARE SLOWER BUT LESS DANGEROUS PATHWAYS.IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS, STEINER WROTE THAT THE CORE OF THE EARTH IS MADE OUT OF THESTUFF OF BLACK MAGIC. WHETHER HE MEANT THIS METAPHORICALLY OR LITERALLY, ITSEEMS TO BE THE FATE OF CONTEMPORARY HUMANITY TO DRAW ALL FORMS OF BLACK MAGICUP TO THE SURFACE. PERHAPS THIS IS WHY OUR DREAMS, AS WELL AS OUR POLITICS, TENDTO BE SUFFUSED WITH DARK MATTER, WITH FEAR AND ANGER AND UNCONSCIOUS RAGE.IF I WASN’T STUDYING MY DREAMS, I WOULD NOT HAVE LEARNED I WAS GETTING THESECONSTANT INDUCEMENTS FROM OTHER BEINGS OR OTHER PARTS OF MY PSYCHE. PERHAPS IWOULD HAVE SIMPLY FELT THE DESIRE TO INCREASE MY INTAKE OF DRUGS AND FOLLOWEDTHE IMPULSE. CURRENTLY, I SUSPECT OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY SUFFERS FROM A SIMILARSYNDROME. BECAUSE WE DENY OUR INTUITION, BECAUSE WE DON’T BELIEVE IN SPIRITS ORLISTEN TO OUR DREAMS, BECAUSE WE HAVE BANISHED OUR POTENTIAL SHAMANS TO MENTALINSTITUTIONS AND HOMELESS SHELTERS, BECAUSE WE HAVE IMPRISONED OURSELVES WITHINVIRTUAL SHELLS OF TECHNOLOGY, IT MAY BE PATHETICALLY EASY FOR AMBIGUOUS,SUPERSENSIBLE ENTITIES—DEMONS OR DEVAS, ARCHONS OR RAKSHASAS—TO CONTINUALLYOPERATE ON OUR MINDS, FILLING THE VACUUM WE HAVE CREATED WITH SLUDGE,ANESTHETIZING US TO DEEPER LEVELS OF WISDOM.IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEN WE, THE PRIVILEGED INHERITORS OF AN INCREASINGLYINSECURE AND GLOBALLY DESTRUCTIVE EMPIRE, CAN BE SEEN AS SUFFERING FROM DEMONICPOSSESSION ON A VAST SCALE. THE PARASITES MANIPULATING US HIDE WITHIN OUREGOCENTRIC MATERIALISM AND SPIRITUAL NIHILISM. THEY LAUGH AT US IN OUR DREAMS.THEIR WILL IS ENACTED BY MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS THAT CAN BE SEEN,SHAMANICALLY, AS AMBIGUOUS SENTIENT ENTITIES THAT PREFER TO ACT OUTSIDE OF HUMANCONTROL, IN OCCULT ECOLOGIES OF INFORMATION AND HIGH-SPEED FINANCIAL MARKETS.LIKE ALL ARCHONS, THESE CORPORATIONS, OFTEN BRANDED BY MYTHOLOGICAL SYMBOLS,INCREASE THEIR OWN POWER BY COMPELLING HUMAN BELIEF AND SACRIFICE TO THEIRGREATNESS. THEIR AIM SEEMS TO BE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE EARTH INTO A NONHUMANWASTELAND.WHERE WILL WE FIND SHAMANS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SUCK THE SPIRITUAL POISON FROM OURSOCIAL BODY AND VOMIT IT OUT FOR US? WIZARDS WHO CAN TAME THESE DEMONS?VISIONARIES WHO CAN POINT THE WAY FORWARD? THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE. UNLIKELY ASIT SEEMS, WE HAVE TO BECOME OUR OWN SHAMANS, WIZARDS, AND SEERS. AS SPIRITUALWARRIORS, WE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PLIGHT OF OUR SPECIES. TO BREAKTHE SPELL OF OUR CULTURE’S DEATH-TRAP DECEPTIONS AND HYPNOTIC DISTRACTIONS, WENEED THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT WHAT LIES BEHIND THE OPEN DOORS OF OUR OWN MINDS."},{"pageContent":"BibliographyAnderson, Edward F.
