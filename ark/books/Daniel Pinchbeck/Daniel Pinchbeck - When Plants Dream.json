At the time, the “vine of souls” was hardly knownin New York City. Michael Brownstein, an older poet friend of mine, first toldme about it. He belonged to a small underground community of drinkers and got mean invite.That initial journey was nauseating and not particularly revelatory. I had oneexperience of “witness consciousness”, watching the process of thoughts forminginside of my head like synaptic clouds. I saw a waterfall cascading in thejungle. I also experienced intense nausea and purged, uneventfully. Even so, Iwas intrigued enough to want to go deeper.Inspired by Jonathan Ott’s Ayahuasca Analogues (1994), I started cookingayahuasca in my apartment with friends. We bought the powdered plant matter froman online source, “Basement Shaman”. We drank it without ceremony, sprawled inmy living room, listening to Beethoven, Bartok and Thelonious Monk as wejourneyed through astral realms. These journeys left me yearning to exploretraditional methods.A year or two later, I went to the Amazon jungle in Ecuador to drink ayahuascawith an indigenous group, the Secoya, whose future was threatened bydeforestation and the encroachment of the oil companies. The Secoya possessedwhat seemed to be an ancient tradition with the medicine, which had shaped theirculture and spiritual worldview. There were an estimated 30,000 Secoya livingbetween Peru and Ecuador at the beginning of the 20th century. By the time Ivisited them, their number had dwindled to fewer than 650, split between twodistant villages.Travelling to the Secoya homeland by plane, bus and boat, I was struck by theeerie correlation between our industrial civilization’s rampant destruction ofthe rainforest and the power of this ancient visionary medicine that seems to besnaking out of the jungle to reach us in our metropolitan homes. As we pollutethe Amazon, strip-mine, log and turn it into farms – soybean and oil palmplantations that rapidly turn to dust bowls and scrubland – we also heedlesslyannihilate traditional cultures like the Secoya. When we drink ayahuasca, wefind that these cultures hold precious – even essential – knowledge for ourfuture.In 2002 I published my first book, Breaking Open the Head, a personal andphilosophical inquiry into psychedelic drugs and indigenous shamanic practices.In that work, I explored the gamut of visionary substances including naturalplants like psilocybin mushrooms, peyote and iboga as well as syntheticcompounds such as LSD, MDMA, ketamine and 2C-B. At the time the book came out,there was little mainstream interest in this field.During the countercultural chaos of the late 1960s, governments madepsychedelics illegal – even though, just a few years earlier, leadingpsychologists were promoting the compounds as “wonder drugs”, the most powerfultools for exploring and understanding the human mind we had ever found. Over thenext few decades, our society’s gatekeepers demonized and repressed them to anextraordinary degree. Governments forbade scientists from experimenting withpsychedelics on human subjects all over the world. Almost all reference to themwas removed from psychology textbooks. In the 1990s in New York, where I lived,if you tried to speak seriously about the visionary states induced by thesecompounds, you would be ridiculed and dismissed.As I researched Breaking Open the Head, I went through a series of astonishinginitiations. I went to the equatorial jungles of Gabon in West Africa to takeiboga – a visionary plant sacrament that has become renowned for its ability tocombat addiction – in an initiation with the Bwiti community. For hours I lay onthe ground of the Bwiti temple, travelling back through my life and replayingearly childhood memories as well as scenes from my recent past, while thecommunity played twangling harps and pounding drums around us. I visited theMazatecs in Oaxaca, Mexico, where the “magic mushrooms” were rediscovered byGordon and Valentina Wasson, an American banker and his wife, in the 1950s. Isat in ceremony with a descendant of the celebrated shaman Maria Sabina. Ivisited the legendary psychedelic chemist Sasha Shulgin and sampled some of hiscreations. Shulgin took the known psychedelic compounds and added molecules tothem, transforming their effects.Through these journeys, I realized psychedelics were not something useless andmarginal, as my society believed. These compounds played a fundamental role inthe religious and social life of indigenous cultures across the world. Theycould be transformative for modern people, such as myself, who had no sense ofspiritual connection to the cosmos. This was an area with tremendous potentialfor humanity’s future – it was important news for our time.Our society didn’t outlaw and suppress psychedelics because they wereparticularly dangerous – alcohol and cigarettes cause far more health problemsand many deaths. Psychedelics were suppressed for ideological reasons. In thelate 1960s, the establishment felt threatened by a mass opening of consciousnessthat was leading to movements for social and personal liberation. Journalistsdeveloped rhetorical tactics to denigrate psychedelics, lawmakers passedpunitive laws to stop their use, and psychologists halted any exploration ofthis area. They upheld this moratorium for several decades.It is astonishing that a society, like ours, founded on personal freedom,legally prohibits our innate dispensation to explore our own minds. AuthorGraham Hancock wrote in his 2009 article “The War on Consciousness”:At the deepest level, our consciousness is what we are – to the extent that ifwe are not sovereign over our own consciousness then we cannot in any meaningfulsense be sovereign over anything else either. So it has to be highly significantthat, far from encouraging freedom of consciousness, our societies in factviolently deny our right to sovereignty in this intensely personal area, andhave effectively outlawed all states of consciousness other than those on a verynarrowly defined and officially approved list.Over the last century, mass consumerism became the way of life for most of theworld. America and Europe launched this social experiment, which seeks tosugarcoat every aspect of life by providing a product for it. In a consumeristculture, everything is meant to be as safe and comfortable as possible.Unpleasant topics – such as death – should be kept hidden at all costs. Thevisionary plant sacraments used by indigenous cultures around the world do notconform to this ideology. Psychedelics like ayahuasca are “ordeal medicines” –they taste terrible and induce nausea, often leading to intense vomiting or“purging”. In the process, they force you to confront your own soul. By doingso, they tend to reveal the path to a more authentic happiness.The French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard noted that the mechanism ofrepression generally has a double function: repression immediately repressessomething that is unpleasant or difficult for the conscious mind to remember.But it also seeks to repress the reason why that original repression wasnecessary. I found that psychedelics had been subject to this double force ofsocial and psychological repression – our culture not only forgot about them,but we forgot why we needed to forget.In the 15 years since the publication of Breaking Open the Head, somethingunanticipated happened: public interest in psychedelics blossomed. Governmentsallowed scientific research into psychedelics again. This has yielded a slew ofextraordinary findings in many areas. Today, we find ourselves in a full-scalepsychedelic renaissance. This is happening in a far more grounded and stablefashion than it did in the 1960s.Back then, Timothy Leary, Harvard professor turned psychedelic guru, promotedthe slogan: “Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out.” He inspired a generation of youngpeople (today’s aging baby boomers) to reject mainstream society – at leasttemporarily. Today, psychedelics have become so mainstream that microdosing LSDis touted as a tool for entrepreneurs and software engineers to increaseproductivity.A central focus of the current psychedelic renaissance is the Amazonian plantbrew commonly known as ayahuasca (pronounced aya-wa-ska), or colloquially in theWest as the medicine. As we will explore in more depth, ayahuasca generallyconsists of two plants brewed together into a sour-tasting potion that producesa potent visionary effect (and purging). Ayahuasca is considered the “greatmedicine” of the Amazon basin, used by dozens of rainforest communities in Peru,Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil. Indigenous communities use this visionary potionfor many purposes – above all, for obtaining knowledge of the many realms thatextend beyond the physical.The rapid dissemination of ayahuasca around the world is a complex phenomenon.People often report revelatory insight and healing as a result of their shamanicjourneys. Many practising ayahuasqueros (ayahuasca shamans) have great integrityas healers. But the medicine is outside of the law in most places (although thisis also changing) and shamanism remains an unregulated profession. Because ofthis, the ayahuasca boom provides ample opportunity for charlatans.Our contemporary society tends to promote scientific rationality and a linearmodel of material progress. Ayahuasca shamanism is a spiritual technology thatdoesn’t mesh well with our received ideas of science or medicine. In thishoneymoon phase, the postmodern world has elevated indigenous and mestizo (mixedrace) practitioners to enlightened gurus, without understanding their culture orbeliefs. Unfortunately, some shamans from the Amazon – as well as neo-shamansfrom the Global North – take advantage of their newfound status for power, moneyand sexual gain.When people drink ayahuasca, they often undergo a process of selfdiscovery andinsight that leads them to change aspects of their lives. The healing effects ofayahuasca are truly psychophysical, revealing a deep connection between the mindand body. Many feel that the medicine is something like a sentient being or aspiritual intelligence that interacts with them, seeking to help them.Among the ayahuasca community, a common adage is “one night of ayahuasca is like5 years of therapy”. However, what drinkers of the medicine learn over time isthe great difference between states and traits – you may receive fireworks ofrevelation from your journeys, but whether you can anchor them in your life isanother matter.Over the past few decades, I have watched the global community of ayahuascadrinkers and practitioners grow rapidly. Many friends of mine undergo deep andongoing transformations through their journeys. In my personal work with themedicine, I have felt its healing power. I have also encountered limits in myown development that ayahuasca could not cure.As ayahuasca becomes a global phenomenon, it spreads like a sinuous network ofvines across North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Along with the medicine,certain ideas and assumptions get carried across this global network. Onecommonly held belief is that ayahuasca is, in itself, an entity – in particular,a being with a feminine gender – who has agency and consciousness, as well as aparticular mission and purpose as she extends her reach across the planet.Of course, such an idea – that a plant, or a combination of plants, mightpossess agency and sentience of some kind – falls outside of the currentscientific worldview. We believe consciousness to be something meshed within thecomplex physical structure of the brain. Without a brain, so far as we know,there can be no self-awareness – no memory, language or logic.And yet, we don’t actually know that we know everything about consciousness atthis point. Physicists in the 20th century were forced to revise their beliefsabout consciousness when it became clear that the observer creates tangiblereality due to the act of observation collapsing the waveform to a particle.String theory posits extra dimensions of space– time, although we experienceonly four of them: the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time,which we can call duration. According to physicists, the extra dimensions may behidden within the ones our sense organs can perceive.Current scientists studying the nature of consciousness have advanced the viewthat what we experience as reality is always a “controlled hallucination.”According to Anil Seth, a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscienceat the University of Sussex, we don’t perceive light, sound, or other sensorialdata directly. The brain experiences them as electrical impulses which it thenshapes into a model of the world. Seth theorizes that we can understand dreamsand hallucinations - including those induced by psychedelics - as a result ofthe brain’s tendency toward “predictive processing” when uncertain:The basic idea is that hallucinations occur when the brain pays too littleattention to incoming sensory signals, so that perception becomes unusuallydominated by the brain’s prior expectations,” he writes in “The Real Problem’,an essay for Aeon Magazine. “Different sorts of hallucination – from simplegeometric experiences of lines, patterns and textures to rich hallucinatorynarratives full of objects and people – can be explained by the brain’sover-eagerness to confirm its predictions at different levels in the corticalhierarchy.For Seth, this approach allows us to understand all visionary states within apurely materialist paradigm. While we recognize the utility of his thesis, weare taking a different approach in this book. We choose to provisionally acceptvarious aspects of the shamanic worldview, such as the existence of noncorporealentities or spirits, and the validity of subtle energies that can heal or causeharm. While it would be possible to dismiss all such phenomena because they areunprovable, this does not accord with our own experience as well as a vastcompendium of anecdotal accounts. In fact, the realization that what we perceiveand sense as reality is always a kind of hallucination might allow for new waysto integrate the shamanic worldview within an expanded scientific paradigm.Is it possible that other forms of sentience exist, in some way we don’tunderstand yet, in those other subtler dimensions that string theorists propose?Could such entities enter and explore our world in the seemingly innocuous guiseof shrubs, vines, fungi and cacti? When we deciphered the genetic code,biologists assumed we would discover that humanity possessed the most complexand advanced genome of all species. To our surprise, we discovered that manyseemingly simpler lifeforms hid a far more elaborate genetic structure with amuch larger genome than humans do (a mountain flower, Paris japonica, has agenome 50 times larger than our own species). Does this unfathomable complexitysuggest these entities may know and perceive in ways we can’t yet discern? Arewe getting a hint that our rightful place in the natural order is different fromwhat we currently suppose?The term shamanism describes the spiritual practice of non-literate peoples suchas nomadic hunter-gatherers. Shamans are believed to commune directly withspirits that exist in subtle realms, unmediated by priests or rabbis. Allshamanic cultures around the world believe that reality is suffused and hauntedby spirits. They see animate beings in the forces of nature, ghosts in thebranches of trees, djinn in the leaping flames of a fire. Some of these entitiesare wise and benevolent. Some are tricksters. Some are guides. Others can becruel and vengeful. One of the extraordinary facets of the visionary experienceinduced by ayahuasca is that it tends to make this archaic, animistic andpantheistic worldview visceral again to those from a secular materialist culturewho have lost any concept of the spiritual or any sense of reverence for nature.I have been privileged to visit a number of indigenous cultures, exploring theirceremonial practices and systems of knowledge around the plants they deemsacred. Besides the Bwiti in Gabon and the Secoya in Ecuador, this has alsoincluded the Shipibo in Peru, and the Kogi and Aruak people in Colombia. Eachtime I visited an indigenous group, I found it a revelation. Indigenouscommunities seem profoundly sane to me. Modern industrial society forfeited theintimacy and trust that comes from living as a community. Our civilization isbased on an individualistic, alienated way of life that makes people, for themost part, feel less happy and secure.Even so, we should avoid romanticizing indigenous cultures, valorizing them assomehow pure or innocent. As anthropologist Michael Taussig notes in a 2002interview by Peter Lamborn Wilson, “Shamanism and Ayahuasca”: “All ‘primitive’people in the world are now aware that they have a special role to play in theWestern imagination.” For the most part, post-industrial civilization no longerdenigrates nor actively seeks to eliminate indigenous cultures. We now findvalue in them – ecologically, culturally and spiritually. While this iscertainly an improvement, it involves, as Taussig notes, “polemical politics”that remain questionable. We are in danger of perpetuating a new form ofcolonization, mining traditional spiritual practices and stylistic trappingsbecause it serves us.Today, a great mass of people still believe in a reductive form of thescientific materialist worldview. This paradigm makes no room for spirits,mythological tricksters, demons or deities or for any other form of intention orconsciousness outside of human agency. We see this worldview – reified in ourmachine-based civilization – exerting an increasingly destructive impact on ourliving planet. In fact, we have reached the threshold where we are immediatelythreatened with the prospect of a biospheric collapse that could wipe out mostor all of humanity in a short timeframe. According to current projections ofclimate scientists, this could happen within this century.We confront the insanity of a so-called technical and “rational” civilizationmade up of human beings acting on self-interest, who collectively drive,according to some estimates, over 100 of our fellow species per day toextinction as we pollute our environment, melt the ice caps, burn the forests,and wrench our delicate climate system far out of balance. Confronting thedeepening ecological emergency unleashed by our industrial (and economic)powers, we continue to build nuclear weapons to destroy ourselves many timesover, use artificial intelligence to design autonomous weaponized drones, andconstruct vast refugee camps to hold the growing legions of the dispossessed –human beings just like ourselves.We must ask ourselves whether the scientific materialist worldview, based onconstricted rationality, unleashed this crisis. As Graham Hancock notes in “TheWar on Consciousness”, our society venerates only one state of consciousness:“the alert, problem-solving state of consciousness that is particularlyappropriate to the conduct of science, business, war, and logical inquiry” whilewe ignore “many other states of consciousness that the amazing and mysterioushuman brain is capable of embracing.” Is it possible we need to shift ourperspective, overcoming this one-dimensional worldview, if we want to continueas a species living with Earth? Could ayahuasca shamanism – the healingdiscipline of Amazonian curanderismo (the art of the curandero or shaman-healer)– help us make such a shift?European alchemists explored something they called the “anima mundi” or the soulof the world. Like Amazonian shamans, they recognized myriad forms of spirit andsentience that flicker all around us. A current idea popular through the globalayahuasca community is that ayahuasca represents the intelligence of nature – anancient, botanical sentience – reaching out from the Amazon jungle at thiscritical juncture to change human consciousness and behaviour to avert ourseemingly inevitable biospheric collapse.Recalling an ayahuasca ceremony in Brazil, ethnobotanist Dennis McKenna wrote inhis memoir The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss (2012): “Somehow I understood– though no words were involved – that, the Banisteriopsis vine was theembodiment of the plant intelligence that embraced and covered the earth, thattogether the community of the plant species that existed on the earth providedthe nurturing energy that made life on earth possible.” He encountered the vineas “an infinitely wise, incredibly ancient, and enormously compassionate‘ambassador’ to the human community.”If we consider this idea of the ayahuasca plant and brew as possessingintelligence and agency from an anthropological or academic distance, it seemslike romantic wish-fulfillment – a kind of absurd projection of our own desiresonto an exotic cultural phenomenon. Yet from within the experience of many whodrink the medicine, it feels like ineluctable truth. I find it worth exploring,as a working hypothesis. In my visions, the spirit of ayahuasca has come tovisit me many times as a female entity. She seems to communicate directly withsome aspect of myself – perhaps my soul – that exists separate from my consciousmind.This book presents an overview of ayahuasca, reviewing what we know (and don’t)about its origins and traditional uses, its healing properties and its impact asit spreads and diffuses through our spiritually impoverished postmodern world.We offer it as a guide for those who wish to explore this area, as well as forthose who already belong to the ayahuasca community and want to consider thehistorical origins and political implications of these practices. We also askquestions about cultural imperialism, gender, and commerce as it relates to thespread of plant medicine and the exploration of shamanic realms. Generally,ayahuasca is having a tremendously benevolent impact on our culture. But thereare areas of ambiguity in its dissemination that must be acknowledged. This bookseeks to address those areas as well.What became clear to me, as I reflected upon and researched this book, wasayahuasca’s profound impact on my friends and my community – a global communityof people in many disciplines. Their stories overlap and interweave with my own.While one can be suspicious of any single story of transformation or redemption,when you encounter a large number of them, they begin to reveal a pattern. Whileresearching this book, we found this Amazonian medicine is inspiring ageneration of seekers, curious souls, global nomads and creatives. For many, itcatalyses deep processes of healing and self-discovery.Ayahuasca leads some wealthy people to change how they invest their money,causes some entrepreneurs to question their work and change their careers,inspires new art and new visions from artists. By increasing the level ofawareness about our interdependence with nature and also revealing thesacredness of nature, ayahuasca opens hearts and rewires world views. We hopethis book will make this growing global community more aware of the medicine’sfull context, its uses and abuses, as an increasingly uncertain future opens upbefore all of us.Hovering over this investigation are deeper questions – metaphysical,ontological ones about the nature of reality as well as the consciousness ofnature. What does it mean to consider the agency or intelligence of plants? Isit possible that plants such as those in the ayahuasca brew – as well as other“master plants” used by curanderos, healers, throughout the Amazon – canactually speak to us, and through us, about our shared world? Is there anintrinsic relationship between human consciousness and the sentience of plants?Is it possible that a truly human future lies, not in futuristic technologicalprogress causing further alienation from the Earth, but in a consciousreintegration with nature as we learn to access the subtler realms of psyche andspirit?If plants can speak to us in visions, do they also dream? If plants dream, canwe learn to dream with them? Learning to dream with the plants, could we awakenour species from sterile materialism into a new dream of collaboration with asuper-sentient nature? Before the ecological clock runs out, can we define a newharmonic balance with nature and cosmos – rediscovering the anima mundi, theliving imagination and soul of the world, of which each one of us is a uniqueexpression?Sophia:It was snowing during my first yagé (ayahuasca) ceremony, on the evening of my19th birthday. Twelve of us sat in a circle on the tarnished wooden floor of anabandoned house on the Atlantic coast, swaddled in colourful blankets. Some hadsmall crystals, miniature brass statues of Hindu idols, flutes, flowers –“meaningful objects” we were instructed to bring in an email we’d received aweek before, along with a list of dietary restrictions and advice for thejourney we were about to embark on. I brought my notebook.Simón sat in a wooden chair, his iridescent blue feathered headdress shimmeringin the flickering candlelight. With every breath he took, the tiny dried seedshe wore across his body softly clamoured like raindrops. He occasionally glancedup as we nervously made small talk among ourselves. “Is this your first time,sister?” a man with red hair and kind eyes asked. He wore a stained yellowtunic, round glasses and a sunhat woven with intricately patterned glass beads.Simón cleared his throat to welcome us: “Bienvenidos hermanos, hermanas.”Silence fell over the room, as the wind howled outside. His voice was warm andslow, like honey. Sitting next to him was a young American woman with her paleblonde hair woven into braids, translating his message to us: “Esta realidad, noes la unica verdad – this reality, isn’t the only reality. Where we will go withthe yagé … this is real. We drink yagé to truly see.”One by one, we were called to drink. My heart was pounding hard as I walked upto him and knelt on the ground at his feet. He poured a thick brown syrup froman old Coca-Cola bottle into a shot glass and whispered over the sacrament. Ashe prayed over the potion, I glanced to the table at his side, where shamanicparaphernalia neatly lay upon an embroidered cloth: a bundle of dried leaves,Agua Florida, a harmonica, a variety of powders, pastes and bird bone tubes. Irealized this was the first ceremony or ritual I’d ever attended, save thehandful of times I half-heartedly drank the blood of Christ at church onChristmas eve. He handed me the brew and, hoping for the best – for something –I drank.For the next year I spent most weekends at ayahuasca ceremonies in yoga studios,smoke-stained tipis, straw-floored barns, dodgy squats, in futuristic penthousesand Native American reservations under the stars. Most ceremonies wereorchestrated by men who proclaimed to study under the tutelage of indigenouscommunities (that I’d never heard of) in the Amazon rainforest, like theShipibo-Konibo or the Cofán. Others were run by so-called “basement shamans” –also men who wore storebought eagle feathers and purchased dehydratedBanisteriopsis vines on the darknet, playing Brazilian acoustic guitar tracks oniPods and encouraging us nauseous trippers to “feel the love of the mother” byfeeling each other.The medicines I drank only occasionally induced visions – but every time I leftfeeling a little lighter, like I had a better sense of what I could improveabout myself, how I could be a blessing in the lives of my loved ones. Lookingback, I think I kept going not so much for the ayahuasca, but for the context: agroup of people singing and praying for clean water, tall trees, healing andpeace. Ceremonies were places to pause and reflect on life with a communitybrought together by the desire to, as we say, get well.On weekdays I went into a New York City autopilot trance, cramming into thesubway at dawn, sitting in college classes in the West Village, and runninguptown in the evenings where I worked at a restaurant serving filet mignon andchampagne to botoxed socialites. I felt myself becoming socially awkward,increasingly uncomfortable hanging out with friends who preferred to meet up atparties and bustling bars. Alone at home, I translated my abstract,ayahuasca-inspired visions and dreams in my notebook.One day after school, I received a phone call from Bellevue Hospital notifyingme that a friend of mine, an Aleister-Crowley-loving blue-eyed boy from upstateNew York, had been admitted to the psychiatric ward. He had just returned from aseries of ayahuasca ceremonies in the Brazilian Amazon. The intensity of theseceremonies, I learned, had triggered a violent schizophrenic break.At Bellevue he wore a papery blue gown and wouldn’t speak much. I suggested weplay Monopoly. When we opened the box, he gingerly picked up the paper bills andblew them away. It dawned on me that there might be another side to shamanism,more ambiguous and perhaps darker. A few months later, another friend of mine, atowering Hungarian ayahuasca neo-shaman named Misi who always dressed inRenaissancestyle blouses stinking of frankincense and sweat, disappeared. Misiwent to the Joshua Tree desert where he died of thirst, alone, in a quest forillumination. Perhaps it was suicide. In the wake of Misi’s death, I quitdrinking the medicine, needing time to reassess.I wondered about ayahuasca – how it was used traditionally, and under whatcircumstances (questions that, despite dozens of ceremonies, were neveranswered.) Meanwhile, I watched in disbelief as major media outlets parodied andtrivialized the popularity of the brew. When I went to Burning Man andunderground parties, I saw people heedlessly imitate the indigenous aesthetic,calling themselves shamans while snorting ketamine. I felt my heart break as Iwatched something I thought to be sacred corrupted by the hubris of Westernerslike myself, who sought some kind of communion despite lacking any tradition.But something called me back. A persistent curiosity about the forest: thetraditions, the plants, the people, the intimations of a world of botanicalmagic. I dreamed of plants: of eerie silent monocultures, of moonlit pink petalson serpentine vines – plants with personalities, with lessons to teach. I setthe intention to make it to the Amazon. A year later, on my 21st birthday, Idid.God’s multicoloured peopleOutside an airport in Quito, Ecuador, I stepped into a beat-up blue pickuptruck. In the driver’s seat was Santiago, a chain-smoking Chilean man withslicked-back hair in aviators, red swimming trunks and a sunbleached t-shirt.From a brief series of email exchanges, I’d learned that Santiago had lived withthe Secoya for over 20 years, studying yagé with the handful of remaining elderswho practiced traditional rainforest medicine. Santiago was a caretaker of theelders. He was a keipi ukukë yagé – an initiated yagé drinker.Santiago’s English was limited and I ran out of Spanish words ten minutes intothe ride. We drove in silence for eight hours through Colonialera cobblestoneplazas, eventually winding down suicidal roads carved into cliff sides, veiledin thick mist past the cejas de las montañas – the “eyebrows” of the Andes. Wedescended into the lowlands, speeding past interminable tracts of deforestedland, spiky oil-palm trees laid out in rows with military precision. We drovepast pale grey warehouses marked with tin signs in Chinese lettering, past busyoil-company workers in white jumpsuits, alongside miles and miles of rusty pipesrunning adjacent to the road.“They’re like a cancer on the Earth, these roads,” Santiago said, a cigarettedangling from his lip. “They bring death and destruction wherever they go.”In the morning I woke to the sound of women laughing. I was in a small stiltedstructure with corrugated plastic roofing on a hill overlooking a muddy creek.Jurassic translucent green leaves shaded the house. In the water, three womanleaned over a wooden canoe, rinsing the bloody entrails of an animal I laterlearned was a tapir. On the shore, men hacked at the limbs of the beast. Abarefoot man foisted a furry bloody leg at my chest. He gestured for me to bringit to a stilted house where potted plants, a monkey and two ducks were sittingon the porch. Inside, I met Tintin.Augustin “Tintin” Piyaguaje is one of a handful of Secoya elders who preservesthe yagé traditions. As colonialists, Christians and corporations steadilyencroached upon Secoya territory, their population in Ecuador has been reducedto fewer than 650. Young men leave the villages to work as petrol extractors orcorporate agriculture labourers, leaving behind their traditional ways. As theSecoya traditionally pass on spiritual wisdom through men, botanical knowledgeand communion with nañe siekopaï – God’s multicoloured people, celestial beingsaccessed through the yagé trances – vanishes into the past.In the 1960s, multinational corporations discovered hydrocarbon reserves beneaththe rainforest floor. In 1964 the area ironically named Lago Agrio, bitter lake,was transformed overnight by the American oil company Texaco, now a subsidiaryof the petrol giant Chevron. Texaco earned the nickname “Toxico” after dumpingbillions of gallons of toxic waste water into lakes and rivers used byinhabitants of the forest. Chevron’s millions of barrels of crude dank oil sitin unlined open-air pits which remain stagnant and stinking to this day.Some 30,000 residents in five communities, including the Secoya, experiencedirreversible damage as their rivers and forests were polluted. Local indigenouspeople developed strange cancers, women miscarried, and babies were born withmissing limbs. Constant headaches plagued communities and animals dropped dead.It remains one of the worst environmental disasters in history. After more thantwo decades of fierce legal battles, Chevron was finally ordered to pay $9.5billion for repair and environmental remediation. It seemed a rare victory forindigenous people. But in late 2018 an international tribunal in The Haguecemented the tragedy by ruling in favour of the corporation, absolving Chevronof the crime.Around the extraction zones, dingy peri-urban settlements have developed, suchas Shushufindi, known mostly for its “Black Gold Hotel”, prostitution and booze.Massive asphalt highways snake out of these zones, wide enough for 18-wheelersto transport jungle crude to refineries, from where it makes its way to US gasstations. Along the roads, the families of poor labourers settle and createsubsistence farms. As more people move to cities, multinational agriculturecorporations produce crops like soya (Glycine max) and palm oil (Elaeisguineensis). Corporations take over large tracts of land, forcing communitiesonto smaller and smaller parcels of land, to the point where their original wayof life becomes impossible to maintain.But among the Secoya, some of the elders, like Tintin, keep many of theirtraditional practices alive – and joyously. Tintin is known for his infectiouslaugh. He stands proudly at just under five feet tall, usually donning a Nestlébaseball cap and a traditional green tunic. His skin is thick and weathered, butnot wrinkled. Tintin may be in his 70s, 80s or older – it’s hard to tell. MostSecoya elders can only estimate their age, as Western calendars have only becomeintegrated into their culture in the past few decades. Clocks as well ascalendars are a novelty in this part of the jungle. The old watch on Tintin’swrist always reads half past 12, yet he wears it proudly.Over the next few years, I visit Tintin and the Secoya several times, becoming astudent of the yagé ways. I become accustomed to Tintin’s ramblings: his speechan abstract collage of thoughts, yagé visions, and memories. He likes to tellstories about his youth – or at least, I think he does. He jumbles Païcoca, theSecoya’s mother tongue, and Spanish together. When he tells his stories, hewaves his crooked hands around like he’s conducting an invisible orchestra.Tintin was once a greatly respected yagé drinker among the Secoya. Santiago toldme Tintin once fell victim to the sorcery of a jealous shaman in a neighbouringcommunity. After the episode, he lost his speech and was never fully “there”again. Yet something changes when he drinks yagé: he becomes aware of the space,stands up straight and energetically transforms. It’s as if he sheds his oldman’s skin, revealing a mighty body of a feathered, luminescent king.The ceremonyThe elders cracked jokes in Païcoca. In the candlelight, they resembled stoicfigures fashioned from clay. Tintin poured me an intimidatingly large gourd-fullof warm yagé, blessing it with clicks and whistles. I drank, returned to mychambira hammock – exquisitely woven from palm fibres like spiderwebs – anddrifted into a light sleep.My senses somehow became thicker, denser, dampened by the heavy rain and thescent of moist clouds of tobacco floating across the yagé we, the ceremoniallodge organically fashioned out of logs and thatched roofing. The whirring ofthe cicadas intensified. The occasional tinny flicking of cigarette lighterslayered on top of the jungle symphony. I sunk deeper into my hammock as my heartlifted, like the moment before dropping down on a roller coaster. The soundsaround me grew louder, and blurred into each other, and warped like wind rushingthrough the crack of an open window, speeding down a highway. I remembered howto breathe.Then, a gentle luminescence appeared, travelling across my vision likejellyfish. They multiplied. In witnessing them, I transformed into them, as mybody faded into the background, no longer relevant in this scenario. The glowingpersonality-lights evolved, unfolding into impossibly vivid colours and shapeslike holy extraterrestrial origami. My body faded into memory and I wastransformed into pure pattern, moving to the sound of Tintin’s whooping,whining, boar-like huffing and snuffing (sounding so much bigger than his bodycould possibly produce). My gaze was transfixed at the centre of a carnationflower with petals unfurling into a precise, soft and infinite loop. I heard thesound of vomit spilling onto the earth, and watched as a squid scuttled past myvisions, obscuring the colours with black ink.The ceremony seemed endless, interminable. I found myself lost outside, sittingin a pile of brambles with my cotton underwear at my ankles and no flashlight,too drunk to walk to the designated hole to relieve myself. Moving was too hard.I surrendered to the visions, barely feeling the thorns jutting into my humbleheap of awkward gringa flesh in the Amazon rainforest beneath a majesticindifferent cosmos. I watched the menacing darkness, the comforting darkness: avast, open night sky filled with shimmering stars. Each of these stars twinkledin celebration – I suddenly understood they represented worlds, stories of war,gossip, love, discovery, unique ecological knowledge, indigenous wisdom. One byone, the shimmering lights extinguished. One word rained over me, rolling like adroplet of cool water: remember.The bridgeSince those journeys to Río Aguarico, I’ve had the fortune to drink medicinewith other spiritual leaders of Amazonian cultures – all of which share similarhistories, a reverential and symbiotic relationship with plants, and whosefutures are uncertain as the rainforest disappears.The global spread of ayahuasca is unquestionably altering many people’s lives,influencing them, in many cases, to focus on the fragility of our ecosystems,the knowledge possessed by indigenous communities and a renewed sense of thesacred. Many of these first-generation ayahuasca drinkers leave with atransformed perspective on reality itself.In permaculture – a system of design and social ecology that involves observingand working with nature in a symbiotic way – there is a concept called “theedge”. The edge describes the place where two distinct ecosystems meet. Theseare places of tension and unfamiliarity, territories of confrontation, wheredifferent ecosystems overlap and merge. The edge is found where a grasslandmeets a forest, where oceans reach the shore, where wetlands mediate betweenriver basins and fields. Edges are hot spots of biodiversity that inviteinnovation, intermingling, and new forms of cooperation from various species.Edge realms are thresholds of potential and fecundity.The cross-fertilization between a vision-inducing Amazonian potion that comesfrom the depths of the South American jungle and our contemporary consumeristworld is most definitely an edge. Contemporary ayahuasca shamanism remains aliminal zone – a space of healing, creativity, danger and magic. Benki Piyãko, aspiritual leader of the Asháninka people from the Brazilian rainforest,explains:Enchantment – many people try to imagine what it’s like, but very few deserveit. We have many medicines we cultivate in our gardens which we brought fromother enchanted worlds, which we learned of by drinking ayahuasca. Because sheis the continuity of the great spirit here on Earth. Whoever uses it in thecorrect way learns how to live. This is the key that she has delivered to us –so we can access knowledge of the other beings.Through the gift of this medicine, there is a great opportunity for people ofWestern cultures to define a different relationship to the natural world whileforging a new partnership with indigenous communities who are the traditionalguardians of the world’s largest forest. This will only be possible when werecognize, as Benki says, “estamos nessa juntos – we are in this together.”"},{"pageContent":"PART ONETHE QUEEN OF THE FOREST"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE RAINFORESTThe Asháninka people – like the Secoya in Ecuador, a rainforest community whowere once hunter-gatherers – live between the border of Peru and the Brazilianjungle state of Acre, along tributaries of the winding Juruá river. They clusterin modest settlements near water, on small clearings where children play amongthe chickens and dogs, dotted with stilted houses shaded by palm-thatched roofs.While the Secoya in Ecuador have been reduced to a tiny population with theirfuture in jeopardy, the population of the Asháninka is more robust, atapproximately 70,000.Writing about the Asháninka in his evocative novel of ayahuasca shamanism, TheThree Halves of Ino Moxo (1995), the Peruvian poet César Calvo notes that,traditionally, the Asháninka “move every year and burn their huts and theirfarms and return everything to the wilderness, departing for yet another placeto build new huts, their plantings, and their life, only to burn everythingagain to start again and be reborn again!” The elder shaman in his novel says,“if the objective of alleged progress, of alleged civilization is to providehappiness to men, then all of that is a failure. Instead, the Asháninka … arehappy. They live in harmony with the nature of the very real and with the natureof dreamed reality, not disputing anyone’s space. Thus they become thecivilized, the living, the owners of progress, instead of us.”For hundreds of years, semi-nomadic communities intentionally incinerated swathsof forests, leaving behind dense black carpets of ash. In a few years, thischarred matter transforms into fertile soil. These people, often indigenouscommunities, return to this land and temporarily settle, cultivating usefulcrops. They plant the mineral-rich cassava (Ipomoea batatas), root tuberscovered in a waxy bark that protects the fibrous milky meat within.They plant several varieties of bananas, pumpkins and peppers, as well aspurple-black acaí (Euterpe oleracea) berries which cascade from the chartreusefronds of palms (Astrocaryum chambira). Those short bushes drooping with yellowpods speckled in pink wispy flowers, “the food of the gods”, cacao (Theobromacacao), as well as tall palm trees whose chambira fibres are used by both humansand birds to weave threads for shelter.As loggers, miners and farmers expand into the forest, semi-nomadic communitieslose the expansive territories they require to continue their traditionallifestyle. Tapirs, monkeys and deer vanish along with their predators, likejaguar, as once-pristine habitats are destroyed. In some cases, governmentsbrutally force forest and riverine communities out of their ancestral lands.Other communities are edged out slowly, as new pressures accumulate around them.Those who do not take jobs with the mining, agriculture or logging companiessettle down on plots of land – some demarcated, some not – where they mustradically adapt, transitioning to an unfamiliar, sedentary way of life.When groups like the Asháninka find their future uncertain, they do what they’vedone for generations: they consult the plants, seeking spiritual guidance andwisdom. That is what the Piyãko bothers, Moisés and Benki, did when theyrealized the integrity of their community was under threat. The land aroundtheir village had turned dry and chalky after years of continued use. Theabundant wild game that used to roam the bushes was disappearing. They needed tofind a more reliable food source and a new way of relating to their localecosystem.One morning at dawn, Moisés and Benki Piyãko strode into the forest,rhythmically swinging at the thick green growth with their sharp machetes.Holding their wicker baskets, they gathered the glossy leaves of Psychotriaviridis, a bush of the Rubiaceae, or coffee family. They walked further into thejungle until they found a twisted vine, a woody liana, twirling in spirals upinto the rainforest canopy, as thick as a pregnant woman’s calves,Banisteriopsis caapi.They shook the elegant strong vine that grows in double helices. A piece felldown, and they cut it off – traditionally, this was the part of the vine, theysay, that offers itself to be taken. The brothers carried the ingredients to asmall solitary structure where a palm fibre hammock hung near a pile of ashes.Here, they prepared the ingredients to make what they call kamarãmpi – alsoknown as ayahuasca – layering the leaves upon pulverized vines in a metal pot.For hours the leaves, the water and the vine cooked over a carefully-attendedfire, until it boiled down to a brown frothy liquid by sundown.Wearing their kushma tunics with their faces adorned with the red pigment fromthe seeds of the urucum plant, and woven-reed crowns punctuated with the longred plumes of a scarlet macaw, they sat upright in their hand-made chairs anddrank the brown brew as their ancestors have for generations. Like manyrainforest communities, the Asháninka take ayahuasca for many purposes. Duringthis ceremony, Moisés asked how he could be of service to the world, to helpteach lessons from the forest.With eyes closed, they entered into the other realities. In his visions, Moiséswalked by a river and heard a voice. A spirit being was waiting for him. “I wantto show you something,” it said. He saw an unusual structure there; a boat, or aspaceship, hovering over the water. “It wasn’t made of wood – just light. Itwould fly in space, and it was as if it was just cruising the river, but it wasreally sailing in space,” Moisés recalls. The voice spoke again: “There’ssomething I want to show you if you want to learn how to teach.”He stepped into the light-craft and they floated to the samauma tree (Ceibagenus) – sometimes known as the Amazonian telephone. When you yell into theresonant nooks of this tree, it carries sound across the forest. The entity madea gesture in the shape of a triangle, revealing a portal into the tree. Inside,Moisés saw a tiny buzzing metropolis where myriad small yellow creatures weremoving about, totally absorbed in their tasks. He realized he was peering intothe highly organized world of the “bee people”.“Here you have an example of the world in harmony,” he was told, as he observedthis humming golden-hued scene. “He showed me all of these bee people workingtogether for the same goal: They take care of our lives as they take care ofeach other. Everybody has to be the same.”The spirit emissary brought them back to the forest, where Moisés noticed thebees out in his world – how they worked diligently to pollinate fruits andtrees, then returned to the hive to make honey. The bees cared for each tree,every fruit, so it could bring nourishment and colour to this world, while alsotaking care of their own community. “This was the lesson ayahuasca showed me,”said Moisés. “Each of us has to do our part, so that the world can be perfect.”The spirit in the vision taught him how humanity could organize itself as aharmonious collective, equally distributing responsibilities that serve thewell-being of the entire community, much like the bees do. But Moisés recognizedanother layer to the lesson another layer to the lesson: the spirit wasrevealing to him that the bees had a particular gift to offer the Asháninka asthey struggled with accelerating modernization and the dislocation it wasbringing to their lives.Since that time, the Piyãko brothers and other Asháninka communities have becomebeekeepers. They keep wooden boxes in trees to house colonies. The beespollinate the local fruit trees, creating orchards in the jungle. Before theyactively supported the bees’ labours, these trees barely produced fruits. Withtheir new beekeeping initiative, the local jungle has become a luscious oasisagain – a regenerative food forest – all thanks to Moisés’ vision, and thespirit who communicated with him.The Amazon rainforest spans nearly 5.5 million square kilometres (2.1 millionsquare miles) across eight countries in South America including Peru, Brazil,Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela and Ecuador. It is approximately the size of thecontinental United States. Often called the “lungs of the earth”, the rainforestproduces 20 per cent of the oxygen we breathe, and houses the same proportion ofthe world’s fresh water. Nearly a quarter of plant species on Earth – 60,000 of250,000 classified by botanists – are contained within its fertile boundaries.In Tales of a Shaman’s Apprentice (1993), ethnobotanist Mark J Plotkin writes,“a single Amazonian river may harbor more types of fish than are found in allthe rivers of Europe combined.” The Yasuní National Park in the Ecuadorianrainforest contains more bird species than we find in the whole of the UnitedStates and Canada combined. The jungle is home to species of magnificentproportions; the 3kg cururú toad, the 90kg capybara rodent, the 4.5 metrepiraíba catfish, and the aptly named titan beetle, which grows to the size of ahuman hand. The Amazon provides shelter to the world’s largest reptile, themighty anaconda, which can weigh in at 250kg and reach 9 metres in length.Those living in cities like New York or London can hardly imagine theoverwhelming profusion of life continuously surrounding a native of therainforest. “You hear so many existences, you hear so many silent wisdoms, whenyou hear the jungle,” Calvo wrote in The Three Halves of Ino Moxo. He enumeratedfor pages, conjuring a sonic tapestry from another world:Not only the scream of the alert monkeys, not only the humming of themosquitoes, of the arambasa, which you call dragonfly, of the chushpi, whichinfects you as it bites, of the carachupausa, which bleeds without warning; younot only hear the ronsapa hissing in the wind, and the mantablanca, which drinksyour hair, and the quilluavisia of yellow flights, and the papasi, which is bornfrom worms but is not a worm, and the wairanga, which never touches the ground …Through the vast expanse of Earth’s greatest jungle runs a river thought in somestudies to be longer than the Nile at over 6,760 kilometres (4,200 miles), withits 80,470 kilometres (50,000 miles) of vein-like tributaries navigable by steamboats, barges and canoes. About one million people speaking 400 distinctlanguages – including Arawakan, Tukanoan, Panoan, Carib and Tupi-Guarani – liveacross the Amazon. Even today, a few of these groups remain in voluntaryisolation, virtually unknown.Scientists say the nomadic ancestors of these communities migrated across thefrozen Bering Strait from Siberia approximately 20,000 to 50,000 years ago. Thefirst settlers of the forests arrived at least 10,000 years ago. Over manycenturies, they co-evolved with the Amazon, subtly shaping it according to theirneeds and desires. The region remains one of the last stretches of Earth largelyuntouched by the footprint of humans. Even so, an estimated 8,000 years ofintentional horticulture has impacted and even transformed the Amazonian regionas a whole.Over the past decades, anthropologists and ethnobotanists found that indigenoustechniques impacted the region to a much greater degree than originally thought.As stewards and caretakers of their local ecosystem, tribal groups help topreserve the jungle and enhance its regenerative capacities. Through the labourof untold generations, they significantly enhanced biodiversity and soilfertility. As an example of how indigenous groups nurture the fertility of thejungle, we learned from them the practice of creating terra preta. By slowlyburning organic matter, they create a carbonrich tilth that enhances thedelicate Amazonian soil, which can easily dry out and turn to dust. Thispractice has been recognized as valuable in the fight against global warming. Anumber of companies are scaling the practice by creating industrial gasifiers.These machines make fuel out of biomass and produce “biochar” which can besprinkled on soil to replenish it, while sequestering carbon dioxide from theatmosphere.Indigenous forest communities derive their shelter, clothing, food, means oftransportation, weapons and medicine from vines and herbs, shrubs and roots,flowers and fungi, trees and ferns. They cultivate and propagate dozens of plantspecies useful to them. “For us, the forest is the most important thing wehave,” explains Carolina Mahua, a Shipibo traditional herbalist, and daughter ofa prolific shaman in the community of Paoyhan in the Peruvian Amazon. “Since Iwas a little girl, my grandmother taught me how to use plants for everything –especially to cure.”Over the centuries, cultures like the Shipibo have developed an extensiveknowledge as well as an intimate symbiosis with the invisible powers andchemical messengers hidden in the biotic world. Through their plant allies, theyalso formed their epistemologies and spiritual cosmologies. Tribal groups –small communities living in settlements along rivers, linked by trade, kinship,as well as internecine wars and conflicts – shared knowledge of which plants touse and how to use them.Among the diversity of Amazonian flora, we find many plants that affect humanconsciousness in a variety of ways. Ethnobotanists have identified 120psychoactive or psychotropic plants used across the world. Of these, 100 arefound in South America, with the Amazon rainforest providing the richestrepository.Billions of trees in the rainforest photosynthesize, transforming carbon dioxideinto carbohydrates and oxygen. The water vapour produced by the Amazon jungle iscritical to Earth’s climate system, circulating moisture across the globe. Therainforest’s unparalleled biodiversity supplies humankind with useful medicinalplants – most of which scientists have not even studied. Since the dawn of theindustrial era, at an increasing rate, the Amazon rainforest has been undersevere assault from Western civilization. The statistics are unfathomable. In2017 Global Forest Watch estimated that, every minute of the day, we lose anarea of Amazon rainforest equivalent to seven football fields. Deforestation dueto logging, mining, livestock production and industrial agriculture amounts to atotal loss of 51,800 square kilometres (20,000 square miles) per year. Since1978 as much as 20 per cent of the Amazon rainforest has been destroyed.Innumerable animal and plant species disappear as trees are cut down,interrupting hydrological cycles and unleashing carbon dioxide into theatmosphere, raising the temperature of Earth. Preventing further destruction ofthe Amazon rainforest, supporting this surprisingly fragile ecosystem, is anissue of global importance. Studies have shown that lands managed by indigenouscommunities assume quantitatively higher rates of carbon sequestration, andlower rates of deforestation. But indigenous forestdwelling populations aresteadily dispersing (or disappearing altogether) as youth migrate away from theforests, and elders pass away with no future generations to carry forward theircultural memory.Global-warming predictions made by scientific bodies keep fluctuating – but theyare getting increasingly dire. Efforts to keep global temperatures from risingmore than 2°C above pre-industrial levels seem to be failing. At the same time,we are learning that even the 2°C limit set by the 2016 Paris Agreement onclimate change may be too high to prevent catastrophic feedback effects. Earthis currently more than 1°C warmer than it was in the mid-19th century. This isalready having drastic effects. According to the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme, if rates of emissions continue to increase as they do now, we are ontrack for a 4°C rise in temperature by 2050. This would be devastating for theAmazon as well as many other ecosystems. If Earth became three or four degreeswarmer, the rainforest would almost entirely vanish – and with it, its capacityto help mitigate climate change and provide so-called “ecosystem services”, suchas breathable air.It is a common belief in the global ayahuasca community that the medicine – “thevine of souls” – is intelligent. As one European-descended jet-set shaman,running ceremonies between London, Ibiza and Byron Bay, put it: “Ayahuascarepresents the intelligence of nature coming out from the rainforest totransform human consciousness in this time of crisis.” According to thisnarrative, ayahuasca’s purpose in leaving the jungle is to communicate withmodern civilization and offer us the opportunity to transform our perception andour way of being, in harmonic alignment with nature’s principles. However, evenwhen we drink the medicine again and again, it is still our choice asindividuals whether or not we integrate its messages.Over the past few decades, as ayahuasca snakes across the world and twines itsway into the cosmopolitan centres of industrial civilization, increasingly it isembraced not just by rogue anthropologists, botanists and hippies, but bywealthy elites, software engineers, entrepreneurs seeking a competitive edge,and members of the creative class. The hope – one could say the faith or prayer– is that ayahuasca somehow represents the sentient soul of the rainforest. Asit makes its worldwide diaspora, the vine communicates primordial wisdom topeople – not only healing us individually but also putting us back on the path,collectively, toward ecological sanity, resilience and harmonic balance."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE DESIRE OF BOTANYAmazonian plants developed a wide range of chemical defences to attractpollinators and stave off predators. The compounds many of these plants produceinclude a large class of nitrogenous bitter-tasting molecules called alkaloids.While nobody knows for certain why plants produce alkaloids, which require agood deal of a plant’s metabolism to synthesize, it is commonly supposed thatthey do it for defensive purposes, because alkaloids taste bitter and are hardto digest.The chemical artistry of plants is an adaptive solution to their immobility.Over aeons of experiment, plants and fungi evolved various dynamic attributes tostand out from the crowd and, quite literally, have their moment in the sun. Forexample, flowering plants called angiosperms, the fruiting bodies of mycelium,and fruits with sugary skins attract the appetites of roaming creatures who playa role as pollinators. Some plants even have toxic or psychoactive effects onthose who eat them – often, thanks to alkaloids.The class of alkaloids includes compounds that act as stimulants such ascaffeine, theobromine (the active ingredient in cacao), cocaine and nicotine;medicines (quinine, epinephrine, morphine); poisons (strychnine, curare); andpsychedelics (psilocin, mescaline, dimethyltriptamine, as well as thebeta-carbolines found in Banisteriopsis caapi). The range of their effects onhumans are vast. Psychoactive alkaloids induce the buzzy jitters of coffee andcocaine, the warm glow associated with chocolate, the transitory nirvana ofheroin, as well as the heightened perceptions and fractal hallucinations thatpsychedelics unleash.Chemical compounds that stimulate reactions in the human brain and nervoussystem include pheromones, tryptamines, phenethylamines, and methylxanthines.These make up what the maverick psychedelic philosopher Terence McKenna called“nature’s molecular storehouse” – a dazzling array of compounds that interactwith animals’ neurological processing of sensory data. When snorted, drunken,eaten or administered topically, the psychoactive constituents of these plants –as well as extracts from a few insects and amphibians – cause paralysis,psychosis, sexual stimulation, heightened sensory perception and immune systemreboot. They can also induce transcendental – and, by many accounts, telepathic– experiences.McKenna controversially proposed that the existence of such an extraordinaryrange of alkaloids with various effects on the human brain and nervous system isnot simply an accidental byproduct of defensive mechanisms designed to repelinsects and other pests. He called these psychoactive compounds “exopheromones”– chemical messengers devised by the plant world to influence the behaviour ofother species such as our own.When he drank ayahuasca with the União do Vegetal, a Brazilian religiousorganization that uses ayahuasca as its sacrament, Terence’s brother, theethnobotanist Dennis McKenna, had a vision in which he became “a sentient watermolecule, percolating randomly through the soil, lost amid the tangle of theenormous root fibers of the Banisteriopsis World Tree.” McKenna wrote: “I couldfeel the coolness, the dank dampness of the soil surrounding me. I feltsuspended in an enormous underground cistern, a single drop among billions ofdrops … as if squeezed by the implacable force of irresistible osmoticpressures, I was rapidly translocated into the roots of the Banisteriopsis tree…”He was “carried through the articulating veins toward some unknown destination”.McKenna found himself within the extraordinary cellular mechanisms that turnlight into “the molecular stuff of life”. Pulled on a kind of conveyor belt tothe place where photosynthesis occurs. His consciousness exploded as he was“smited by the bolt of energy emitted by the phytic acid transducers and my poorwater-molecule soul was split asunder”. As this vision ended, he found himself“embedded in the matrix” of the plant’s biochemical makeup.Suddenly he was suspended above the Amazon rainforest, looking over its vastexpanse: “The vista stretching to the curved horizon was blue and green andbluish green, the vegetation below, threaded with shining rivers, looked likegreen mold covering an overgrown petri plate.” McKenna felt: “anger and ragetoward my own rapacious, destructive species, scarcely aware of its owndevastating power, a species that cares little about the swath of destruction itleaves in its wake as it thoughtlessly decimates ecosystems and burns thousandsof acres of rainforest.” He wept. Suddenly a voice spoke to him: “You monkeysonly think you’re running things. You don’t think we would really allow this tohappen, do you?”He felt a wave of relief. “I knew that the ‘we’ in that statement was the entirecommunity of species that constitute the planetary biosphere”, McKenna recalled.“I knew that I had been given an inestimable gift, a piece of gnosis and wisdomstraight from the heart/mind of planetary intelligence.”We believe that humans cultivate plants – but could it be the other way around?In The Botany of Desire (2001), Michael Pollan playfully mocks our naive,self-centred conception of human agency by studying a number of plants (apples,marijuana, corn and potatoes) that effectively employ human beings to propagatethemselves. He suggests, instead, that we look at history from a plant’s eyeview. It wasn’t that we developed agriculture so much as cunning members of theplant kingdom domesticated humans and shaped civilization to serve theirreproductive agenda. Farming, for Pollan, is “something the grasses did topeople” – not the other way around.During the Early Cretaceous period, 125 to 100 million years ago, a class offlora called angiosperms emerged with a technique to get animals and insects topropagate them. They evolved to have flowers – an elegant, colourful, fragrantdesign to increase visibility and seduce pollinator species. Later on, accordingto Pollan:A group of angiosperms refined their basic put-the-animals-to-work strategy totake advantage of one particular animal that had evolved not only to move freelyaround the earth, but to think and trade complicated thoughts. These plants hiton a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move and think for them.The agricultural revolution was a reproductive bonanza for corn, wheat, applesand many other species.In his account of interspecies symbiosis, Pollan anthropomorphizes plants as aliterary trope to make a point: we only think we are the drivers of evolution.It is entirely possible there are other agencies in nature that make use of usas much as we make use of them. The same idea has been suggested about canines:did humans domesticate dogs, or did dogs figure out how to influence ourbehaviour in order to help them?Over the past centuries, due to our rapid rise to prominence and the success ofthe scientific method in ferreting out nature’s secrets, humans have developed adistorted model of evolution. Today, we see ourselves as the pinnacle of thepyramid of life on Earth – the top of the food chain, ruling over all. However,complex ecosystems are not pyramids with one species on top. They areinterdependent communities woven together from many organisms.Human bodies are built up out of other lifeforms. According to Carolyn Bohach, amicrobiologist at the University of Idaho, we are 90 per cent microbial and only10 per cent human. Our bodies are woven from more than 100 trillionmicro-organisms. In our physical organism, we carry the whole history of life onEarth. We are literally made of our ancient ancestors – aerobic and anaerobicbacteria as well as co-evolving viruses. When we look at it this way, we realizethat symbiosis is the basic paradigm of evolution – not aggression, competitionnor the “survival of the fittest”.Our relationship with psychoactive plants continuously shapes human history andcivilization, transforming culture in the process. In the 18th century, forexample, England managed to control China by addicting the Chinese to opium theyimported from Afghanistan. The European’s lust for sugar and tobacco was themain driver for the African slave trade, as they needed large work forces tolabour on these plantations in the New World. Ethical considerations – any kindof Christian conditioning – went out of the window as soon as the Old Worlddiscovered its sweet tooth and the pungent smoke of a cigar.To take another example, coffee originally came from Ethiopia, spreading toTurkey and the Middle East. In medieval times, Venetian traders brought it toEurope, in spite of resistance from the Catholic Church. King Charles II triedto ban coffee in England in 1675, arguing that coffee houses “produced very eviland dangerous effects”, leading to idleness and disaffection. They were placeswhere, according to the proclamation, “diverse False, Malitious and ScandalousReports are devised and spread abroad, to the Defamation of His MajestiesGovernment, and to the Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the Realm.” Hisministers quickly overturned the edict, as they were addicts.By the end of the 18th century, there were 600 cafés in Paris. Coffeecontributed to the French Revolution. As they talked together in cafés –discussions fuelled by caffeine – the people got revved up. They realized theyneeded to overthrow the current regime. In the American Revolution, tea played acrucial role with the Boston Tea Party.More recently in the 1960s, marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)induced a change of consciousness that transformed a generation. While LSD doesnot occur naturally, it is closely related to a compound found in ergot funguswhich was used by midwives in the Middle Ages to induce muscle contractions inpregnancy. LSD was made illegal in the United States in 1966. It is quite likelythat the opening of empathy and awareness through chemical means contributed tothe powerful 60s movements for social justice, ecology, communal living andsexual liberation. At the same time, some radicals feared that use ofmind-enhancing compounds were making young people less interested in politicalaction and more focused on exploring their inner reality. This split between thepersonal and the political – between healing one’s self and healing the world –remains a conundrum, a problem that the movements of New Age spirituality andpsychedelic consciousness continue to struggle with today.From the 1950s, psychedelics like LSD and magic mushrooms contributed to avariety of breakthroughs in different fields ranging from the arts tobiotechnology to software. When the American biochemist Kary Mullis won the 1993Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the polymerase chain reaction, hespoke openly about the inspiration he received from his psychedelic journeys.Many of the computer scientists who made critical breakthroughs in sharedcomputing during the 1960s – breakthroughs that later became the basis of theinternet – were avid psychedelic explorers. For example, Apple’s tech magnateSteve Jobs is quoted as saying in Walter Isaacson’s biography of him: “TakingLSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life. LSDshows you that there’s another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it whenit wears off, but you know it.”Drugs define an era: in the 1970s, the robotic rush of cocaine contributed tothe hedonistic nightlife culture of Studio 54 and disco. Cocaine was the secretingredient behind a series of wars and global conflicts. Its widespread use bothreflected and amplified the nihilism and narcissism of that time. Although theuse of ayahuasca will never be as common because of the ceremonial way it isconsumed and limits on its distribution, it does seem to be one of the definingsubstances of our time. The New Yorker dubbed it, with typical snark, “the drugof choice for the age of kale.”The skyrocketing popularity of ayahuasca is part of an ongoing culturalreconsideration that may ultimately lead to a new legal framework permitting theuse of psychedelic compounds for treating psychological disorders. The 1950s and1960s represented the first wave of a renewed interest and rediscovery of thesecompounds in the modern industrialized world. The resurgence of interest inpsychedelics over the past two decades is a second wave – and it is stillswelling.This psychedelic renaissance has a number of aspects. One major facet is therapid growth of scientific research into psychedelics in recent years.From the early 1970s until after 2000, the world’s governments prohibited anyhuman study and most laboratory experiments with psychedelics. These compoundswere originally considered “wonder drugs” by mental health professionals for theinsight they provided into the deeper workings of our conscious and unconsciouspsychologies. In the late 1950s, many psychiatrists and psychologists saw themas the most powerful tools for exploring the human mind we had ever found.By the end of the 1960s, psychedelics were made illegal and classified in theUnited States as Schedule I substances, meaning they were believed to have noknown positive effects and were illegal to manufacture, possess or distribute.While ayahuasca was not outlawed by name, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the mainpsychedelic compound in the ayahuasca brew, was made illegal.A cultural reconsideration has taken place over the past 20 years. At the sametime, science and psychiatry have revived research into these once forbiddencompounds, making many new discoveries as well as substantiating findingsalready made in the 1960s. Among the most impressive studies, Dr RolandGriffiths at Johns Hopkins University conducted a double-blind trial in 2006. Hegave psilocybin (the psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms) to healthyadult volunteers who had never before taken a psychedelic with the intention ofgauging both the immediate and longterm psychological effects of a high dose.Even years later, most participants considered it one of the significantexperiences of their lives – as important to them, in many cases, as theirwedding day or the birth of their first child. On surveys, they also showedpositive changes to various psychological traits that remained with them overtime. For example, they measured as significantly more open to new experiences,even many years after their journey. This is impressive, as such psychologicaltraits tend to become fixed and immutable over time.Perhaps the most important research currently underway is clinical trials of3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as Molly or ecstasy, E) as atreatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), particularly among veteransfrom the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who suffer from treatment-averse forms ofPTSD. In phase II clinical trials conducted by the nonprofit MultidisciplinaryAssociation for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), MDMA-assisted psychotherapy had anunprecedented rate of success, with 60 per cent of participants reportingsignificant benefits or even a complete healing from their condition after threesessions. The findings were so impressive that the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) fast-tracked the approval process for MDMA psychotherapy asa treatment for PTSD. With luck, the therapy could be legally sanctioned by2021. While not strictly a psychedelic (some call it an “empathodelic”), MDMA isa closely related compound. Once approved as a treatment tool, it may provide animportant precedent for the therapeutic use of psychedelics such as psilocybin,mescaline, LSD, DMT and ayahuasca.As part of the psychedelic renaissance, we see a renewed interest and culturalacceptance of natural visionary compounds as religious sacraments. NorthAmerican indigenous groups such as the Kiowa and Comanche of the Great Plainshave used the spineless peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii) that grows in theregion as ritual sacrament for untold generations. Like ayahuasca, peyote itselfis not illegal – but the active psychoactive compound mescaline(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) is. Research by Simon Gibbons and WarunyaArunotayanun published in 2013 in the multi-authored book Novel PsychoactiveSubstances suggests the medicinal use of peyote to heal joint pain, influenza,diabetes, snake and scorpion bites, blindness, asthma and intestinal disordersgoes back 5,700 years.In the early 19th century, Comanche war leader Quanah Parker founded the NativeAmerican Church (NAC), a syncretic blend of Christian and Native American faith,with peyote starring as the ritual sacrament. After a long contentious history,religious use of peyote as a sacrament won federal protection in 1978 with theissuing of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. However, in a case decidedin 1990, the Supreme Court challenged this, removing federal protection from theNAC. At that time, conservative judge Antonin Scalia argued that the state ofOregon had the right to criminalize peyote use in the NAC. This had largerimplications as it suggested that the free exercise of religion was no longerguaranteed by the First Amendment as a constitutional right. The court’sdecision caused an uproar and led to Congress issuing an amendment, theReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which President Clinton signed intolaw. As we will explore later, this has impacted ayahuasca’s changing legalstatus in the United States.Capitalism and globalization have acted as mechanisms for plants, insects andanimals to spread themselves around the world, creating new heterogeneousecologies that will continue to morph and change over time. For all we know, themountains of plastics and toxic trash we have created will provide thenourishment for some new kind of life, millions of years into the future.What seems like chaos and even destruction to us in the short term – as wesurvey the impacts of biodiversity loss and accelerated warming – may actuallybe part of some longer-term evolutionary trajectory that we can’t understand.This has happened many times before in Earth’s history. For example, anaerobicbacteria were forced underground by a global pollution crisis whenmicroorganisms developed photosynthesis, leading to the creation of anoxygen-rich environment where flora and fauna flourished. And of course, thedinosaurs and later megafuana died out, allowing mammals like ourselves to findour niche.Whether or not they are somehow intelligent, spiritually aware, or conscious,plants act as catalytic agents and ambassadors. Historically, they causeprofound changes in human consciousness and, as a result, transform society. Forexample, would there have been an Industrial Revolution without the power ofcaffeine to enhance productivity and focus? Considering the capacity of plantsto change consciousness, we have to gain a deeper awareness of our relationshipto the botanical world. By reaching a more sophisticated understanding of thepower of plants, we can make better alliances with them.As an example, cocaine comes from the coca plant (fondly called mama coca byAndean communities). Coca is revered by many highland communities such as theKogi and Aruak in Colombia. These indigenous communities consume it daily, yetsacramentally. The effects, for them, are positive and benevolent. Modernindustrial techniques created cocaine by using sulphuric acid to extract itspsychoactive component. By doing this, perhaps we cut off the plant’s spirit. Itmight be the case that what we do to the plants they do to us in return.Is it possible that certain plants possess a more encompassing, elder specieswisdom? What if some of them – the teacher plants – hold an intuitive sense ofwhat lies ahead for our world, of the possible branching paths we can take as aspecies? Physicist David Bohm developed the model of the holographic universe.He postulated that what we perceive as space–time already exists, fullyrealized, from the perspective of a higher space–time dimension, much like ahologram. Perhaps the spiritual consciousness of plants like ayahuasca, peyote,and psilocybin-containing mushrooms actually does exist in some subtler orhigher dimension. In that case, the alkaloids they express provide the tangiblemeans for us to access that wider field of the awareness. We provide them withthe sensory apparatus – eyes, nose, ears, body and brain – they need to take alook and walk around our world.As stimulants, narcotics, soporifics, and hallucinogens, plants alter ourperception of the world, as well as our way of thinking about it. If the use ofpsychoactive substances is so influential on culture, then what does thecontemporary spread of ayahuasca – part of a psychedelic renaissance that hasspread globally and grown rapidly over the decades – suggest about our immediatefuture? If ayahuasca, as many drinkers believe, is intelligent, a feminineentity with a purpose, what is “she” seeking to accomplish? If, as many alsobelieve, “her” purpose is benevolent, how do we accomplish it?The Canadian scholar Elena Andrade proposed in her 2014 talk “The Poetics ofAyahuasca”:The integration of these plants into personal practices raises questions aboutthe limits of the human, and whether interspecies communication represents thenext stage of development for our species or the planet.Since psychoactive plants have shaped human history up to this point, is itpossible that ayahuasca has a meaningful role in our future evolution? If so,what role would that be?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE BITTER BREWThe word ayahuasca comes from Quechua, the second-most spoken language in theEastern Amazon after Spanish. It combines their words aya (body, soul, thedeceased) and wahska (rope, vine), lending itself to a variety of Englishtranslations including “vine of the soul” or “rope of the dead”. Across theAmazon rainforest, the brew goes by many names. The Shipibo-Konibo people,indigenous to the Ucayali region of Peru, call both the vine and the brew oni.The Asháninka call it kamarampi, which is a similar variation of the term usedby the neighbouring Yine and Matsigenka groups, likely deriving from either theword kamarank, meaning to vomit or poison, or kama relating to death. In thedeep lowland forests of the North Eastern Amazon in Southern Colombia andEcuador, the brew is often called yagé. Members of the Brazil-based Santo Daimechurch call the brew Daime, which in Portuguese means “give me”. União doVegetal (UDV) church calls the sacrament hoasca. Today in the Western ayahuascasubculture, it’s colloquially referred to as “the medicine” or “grandmother”.The name in each language provides a reference point to particular network ofbotanical and social knowledge.The ayahuasca brew is most often made by cooking together the Banisteriopsiscaapi, with the glossy leaves of Psychotria viridis, widely referred to aschacruna. Sometimes Diplopterys cabrerana, known as chaliponga, anotherDMT-containing plant, is used instead of P. viridis. The vine grows indouble-helix-shaped curlicues, blending into the chaotic flora of the forest andserving as a circuit for howler monkeys to swing across the tree canopies. Theyoung vines bravely wind around elder trees. Older vines, often hundreds ofyears old, sometimes strangle the host trees to death, in a similar gesture tothe mighty anacondas that slither below.The psychoactivity of ayahuasca kicks in 30–45 minutes after ingestion, markedby nausea and shifts in spatial and sensory perception. Sounds may echo,distances between objects become warped, and often intricate patterning developswith eyes open or closed. Body temperature dramatically fluctuates, peoplerecall memories – and some just fall asleep. “The brew has significant affectiveeffects: after an initial phase of fear, one usually experiences greattranquility that often leads to euphoria and a sense of deep self-fulfillmentand profound happiness” writes cognitive psychologist and philosopher, BennyShanon, in his 1997 article “A cognitive-psychological study of ayahuasca”.The brew is a famously intense purgative. For most, it causes shivering,sweating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. According to Georgetown Universityneurology professor James Giordano, the intense physical reaction to ayahuascais caused by the brew’s action on a part of the brainstem known as the “areapostrema”. The area postrema has a high density of dopamine receptors, and isthe vomiting control centre. In the area postrema, ayahuasca acts on 5HT3serotonin receptors, also located in the gut. This action is believed to be thephysical cause for all of the nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The brew itselfmay be responsible for the gag-reflex and shudder, since the brown frothy sludgesmells like acrid fermented earth.Luzmila, a vegetalista (plant medicine healer) living on a tributary of the RioMarañón in Peru, believes the common interpretation of the word “huasca”,meaning vine, is a misinterpretation. “The original name is hoasca: hoa meansbitter. It’s a bitter medicine because it reminds you of the bitterness that youhave allowed into yourself.”Often, ayahuasca simply goes by the name la purga: the purge. “There’s a hiddenlanguage in the way you purge. There’s a reason why you purge through the mouthsometimes, or why you purge through the back [end], or why you cry,” saidLuzmila. In the visionary state, the increased sensation of needing to vomit isoften accompanied with “bad feelings” or difficult memories – spiders crawlingall over the body, a feeling of jealousy, disgust, guilt. The purge is ametaphysical as well as physical expulsion: emotional baggage and spiritual“grossness” that the nausea evokes is released, often quite dramatically,through the purge. Many people fear the vomiting, but ayahuasca drinkers learnthat purging can be a healing balm for the soul.The potent, purgative and psychoactive effects of the potion are used todiagnose and heal individual illness, as well as communal trauma. According tothe PhD dissertation of the anthropologist Elsje Maria Lagrou, among theKashinawa of northwest Brazil, ayahuasca is “a means of transport and oftransformation, a means of reconnecting with invisible layers of the cosmos, aswell as a way of making present the world and stories told in myth throughimaginary experience.” Contact with spirits – helpful, malevolent, bird-shaped,bug-eyed, serpentine, leonine, haughty, spirits of the deceased, from the sky orunderground, or extraterrestrial, is pervasive throughout the myriad ayahuascatraditions of the Amazon.Ethnobotanist Wade Davis writes in the preface to a book of Richard Schultes’Amazonian photographs entitled The Lost Amazon (2004):The Tatuyo and Barasana liken yagé to a river, a journey that takes one abovethe land and below the water, to the most remote reaches of the earth, where theanimal masters live and lightning is waiting to be born. To drink yagé,anthropologist Geraldo Reichel-Dolmatoff wrote, is to return to the cosmicuterus and be reborn. It is to tear through the placenta of ordinary perceptionand enter realms where death can be known and life traced through sensation tothe primordial source of all existence.Amazonian shamanic practice has degrees of ambiguity that the vast majority ofWesterners don’t yet understand. The tendency of the contemporary New Ageculture is to revere the shaman as a new type of spiritual master or guru,coming out from the jungle with an enlightened ethical code. But this is ourinterpretation of cultures that don’t share our dualistic concepts of good andevil, priests and sinners. “Amazonian shamans have never claimed to be eitherwise men or saints,” writes anthropologist Jeremy Narby in the multi-author workAyahuasca Reader (2000). “Their job is to bring about transformations byenchanting their clients.”In the Amazon, ayahuasca is routinely used not just for vision and healing butfor nefarious purposes: to gain occult powers, to attract or seduce lovers, tohex or even kill enemies in the visionary realms. In The Expanding WorldAyahuasca Diaspora (2018) the anthropologist Beatriz Labate finds social utilityin the practice of sorcery or black magic:Westerners generally either ignore the existence of sorcery in indigenousayahuasca shamanism, or tend to consider it as a problematic dark practice fromill-intentioned shamans. However, anthropologists have shown that sorcery oftenplays an important role in balancing inequalities and combating injustice, andalso in the cultural reproduction of these groups.The Kofan people, for example, are well known to have used yagé to enter thevisionary states in order to shoot tsentsak, poison darts, at their enemies onthe astral plane, hoping to kill them.Banisteriopsis caapi can be taken alone, without the DMT-containing admixture.In fact, this may have been a common practice among many communities. It may bewhat drinking ayahuasca meant originally, in most regions, with the addition ofchacruna or chaliponga a relatively recent innovation. The legendary Harvardbotanist Richard Evans Schultes recalled his time with native communities of thenorthwest Amazon in Brazil and Colombia who… use the Banisteriopsis drink for prophetic and divinatory purposes and also tofortify the bravery of male adolescents about to undergo the severely painfulyurupari ceremony for initiation into manhood. The narcosis amongst thesepeoples, with whom I have taken caapi on many occasions, is usually pleasant,characterized by visual hallucinations in colour, which initially is very oftena shade of blue or purple. In excessive doses, it is said to bring onfrighteningly nightmarish visions and a feeling of extremely reckless abandon,although consciousness is not lost nor is use of the limbs unduly affected.Psychotria viridis is a dark-green shrub. In its shiny yet otherwiseunremarkable-looking leaves can be found the psychedelic compoundN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) – an illegal Schedule I substance under US andinternational drug laws, which is also a compound found in small amounts inhuman cerebrospinal fluid. Rick Strassman, author of DMT: The Spirit Molecule(2000) has proposed that DMT may be synthesized in the pineal gland, along withthe neurotransmitter-like compound melatonin. This is an intriguing hypothesis,as the pineal gland is often associated with the third eye and was consideredthe “seat of the soul” by the French philosopher René Descartes.Many unrelated plant species synthesize the psychoactive tryptamines DMT andderivatives 5-methoxy-DMT (5-MeO-DMT) and 5-hydroxy -DMT (5-HO-DMT, also knownas bufotenin). The Bufo toad (Incilius alvarius) croaking in the Sonoran desertof Mexico, secretes an extremely concentrated form of 5-MeO-DMT. DMT has beenfound in trace amounts in many plants and animals – such as in the livers ofrabbits and the peels of lemons and oranges.When consumed orally, DMT is instantly recognized by enzymes in the stomach andneutralized. Hence, when eaten on its own, the chemical has no psychoactiveeffects. The psychoactive effects of DMT can be directly accessed by smoking apowdered extraction from the plants – the “business man’s trip”, which sendsusers on a 10-minute plunge into another reality that some find harrowing andothers delightful. When smoked, DMT provides a brief and spectacular flash oftotal immersion in an alien world. With the brew, the effect of thebeta-carbolines slow down the diffusion of DMT, allowing for visions that arelower resolution but far longer lasting (several hours).The alchemy of ayahuasca lies in the combination of the monoamine oxidaseinhibitors (MAOIs) in the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, and the DMT contained inthe chacruna admixture. The ayahuasca vine contains the betacarboline alkaloidsharmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine. These MAOIs inhibit the activity ofmonoamine oxidase enzymes, allowing for the DMT to be absorbed in the gut. WhenDMT passes the blood-brain barrier, it bonds to neural receptors that typicallyhost serotonin – the molecule responsible for feelings of well-being, happiness,elation. DMT has a similar molecular structure to the neurotransmitterserotonin. DMT temporarily fits into these receptor sites like Tetris blocks,producing dazzling changes in perception.PreparationThe preparation of ayahuasca varies by region, but typically involvespulverizing the B. caapi vine with a blunt object, tearing the vines apart andplacing them into a large cooking vessel over an open fire, layering on theleaves of either P. viridis or D. cabrerana – boiling the decoction anywherefrom half a day to 24 hours, depending on the desired strength of the brew.During this process, those who are making the brew might drink small amounts ofit, which makes them more attentive to the plant matter, subtle synchronicitiesand the surrounding jungle.By the headwaters of the Igarape river, one finds the small village called Ceúdo Mapiá. Ceú do Mapiá – heaven of Mapiá, is unlike the villages nearby. It wasfounded in 1983 by Sebastião Mota de Melo – a beloved white-bearded patriarch ofthe Santo Daime church. At the centre of the community is a large woodenstructure formed by two triangles joined together to create a six-pointed star.Throughout the year, residents and pilgrims from around the world dressed inwhite come to pray, dancing in circles, shaking rattles and strumming guitars inmesmerizing union while drinking the Daime.Down a winding path shaded by palm leaves is a wooden structure where hundredsof jugs of Daime stand on dusty spider-webbed shelves, redolent of the rows ofpotions in the storerooms of medieval alchemists. Light filters through thewooden slats, illuminating the bottles and revealing their varying shades andconsistencies. Some bottles of the Daime are dark brown, and others an amber inclarity. The Santo Daime church, being the largest organization that usesayahuasca as a legally recognized religious sacrament, produces the largestquantities of the brew on Earth, which one follower of the church called “kosherayahuasca” for its simplicity and dependability.The woody B. caapi vine – what they call da força, the force – is oftenharvested from the local garden, but at other times men walk many miles into thejungle seeking an old and thick vine. Then comes a luz, the light, found in theshiny leaves of the P. viridis shrub. The alchemical combination of the force ofthe bark and the light of the leaves creates Daime, the brew that devotees ofthe church deem to be holy, a sacrament. Considering the plants’ impact on thehuman psyche, the terms “the light” and “the force” make sense. The leaves of P.viridis provide a Technicolor blast of visionary power. The ayahuasca vineextends the visions and brings about deeper levels of healing.Daniel:In 2003, I helped prepare ayahuasca with the Santo Daime in Brazil. I was with asmall group of European and American tourists, led by Jyoti, an extraordinaryshamanic teacher from the US. The morning after a ceremony, we took a riverbarge that travelled three days and nights, into the humid heart of the Amazon.We brought the chacruna leaves with us spread out in a huge pile on top of atarp. I slept on top of the barge in a hammock, watching the trees as we chuggedslowly along.The boat took us to the small town of Juruá, one of the Santo Daime’ssanctuaries deep in the rainforest. We travelled with Padrinho Alfredo, theleader of the church. About as deep in the jungle as you can get, Juruá is arudimentary village without stoves, refrigerators or internet. One generatorprovides illumination for their all-night ceremonies.We learned that generally the Santo Daime separate the tasks of working with theP. viridis (or chacruna) leaves and preparing the ayahuasca vine between thegenders. The women clean the shiny leaves of chacruna. The men chop, pound andscrape the vine. When we reached Juruá, we were told that Padrinho Alfredoreceived guidance that the men should also work with the leaves. I was happy asthis meant I was involved with both aspects of the preparation.Before the preparation, we all drank a small amount of the medicine – not avisionary dose, but enough to deepen and enhance our senses. The sounds andsmells of the jungle surrounding us seemed to become more pronounced.I attuned to the plant material on a deeper level, feeling more present,detached from my normal sense of ego or identity with its associated worries. AsI cleaned the chacruna leaves one by one, each individual leaf seemed like afemale entity asking for its moment of precise and special attention. We sangSanto Daime hymns during the cleaning, which took place in a simplethatch-roofed building not far from the riverside.The next day, I joined a team of six men who pounded the vine in rhythmiccoordination. We sat on tree stumps under the thatched roof of an open workarea. We used heavy mallets to break apart the plant matter. It was hard labour– quickly tiring work. This time, we also sang Santo Daime hymns and drank smallcups of the medicine as we worked. The set-up was like something from the 1920s,from the time of the rubber tappers: we used no advanced technology. There wasonly one generator in town, with electricity only used to keep on some lights atnight, for evening meals and ceremonies. I realized that Santo Daime was aproduct of that era of crude industrialization, and it was marked by it.Daimistas applied basic mechanical processes to scale up the making of thesacrament for a larger community that included mestizos as well as indigenouspeople. Some Santo Daime ceremonies can have 100 participants or more, whilecommunities drink in much smaller groups. They had a row of large bubbling ironpots in which the vine and the leaf were boiled down together into the familiarbitter brown liquid, its consistency not much thicker than water.I felt euphoric to be contributing my labour and prayers to this sacredcommunity process. It was hard work that would have spiritual benefit for all ofus. I felt honoured to contribute what I could. I also had the sense, as themedicine took effect, of being deeply attuned to the incessant interminablejungle all around us. I knew so little about it compared with this community wholived in the middle of it, in such simple conditions. I was told that if youstrayed from the path, you would get lost within minutes and never be foundagain. Soon animals would devour you. Within 24 hours, you would “go from beingpart of the jungle floor to the forest canopy”, I was told. Even though I wasunder the strong effects of the brew, I carefully stayed on the path.At one point, one of the men from our group of European and American visitorscut himself. He shrugged it off, but I remembered hearing that wounds becameinfected almost immediately in the rainforest. I went to get antibiotics andbandages for him, taking a winding path through the jungle. The density offoliage – the stillness within the turbulence – seemed almost overwhelming tome.The next night, we drank the Daime we had cooked at their ceremonial centre.After a few weeks of Santo Daime ceremonies in Brazil, I felt light,clear-headed, lacking a strong sense of ego or any fixed identity. That night,under open skies pouring down rain, I felt I received something like abenediction from the astral realms. In my visions I was surrounded by incrediblybeautiful spirit-beings wearing bright crowns, covered in flowers. They radiatedshimmering coronas of ultraviolet, rainbow-hued light. It was the most purelytranscendent experience of my life – an ecstasy I will never forget. Inretrospect, I feel that ayahuasca gave me this spiritual reward because I hadmade the pilgrimage and dedicated myself to making the medicine and meeting itat its source."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4MODERN ENCOUNTERSThe Western world’s adventure with this psychoactive Amazonian potion began withEurope’s colonization of South America four centuries ago. Ayahuasca was firstmentioned by a European chronicler, José Chantre y Herrera, a Jesuit priest, in1675. Herrera saw it as a means of conjuring the devil:They make this concoction of vines or bitter herbs, which, after a great deal ofboiling, becomes very thick. Since it is so strong as to derange a person evenin small quantities, the dose is minimal, and fits in two small receptacles. Thesorcerer, each time he drinks, consumes very small amounts, and knows very wellhow many times he can drink the potion without losing his sanity in order tocarry out the ceremony with due solemnity and direct the chorus, since everyoneresponds to his invocation of the devil.Over the following centuries, Spanish colonialists and missionaries attempted toend these indigenous customs and rituals – brutally.The first encounter between European scientists and the visionary vine happenednearly two centuries later, when the British ethnobotanist Richard Spruce(1817–1893) first catalogued Banisteriopsis caapi. The self-educated botanistspent over 15 years in South America, beginning to document trees in theBrazilian Amazon and later on up the Amazon river and its headwaters andtributaries near the Andes. While Spruce left an immense legacy behind him, hemade a meagre living. He would return only occasionally to London’s Kew Gardensto add his samples to what became the largest collection of botanical specimensin the world. His research on cinchona bark (Cinchona pubescens), the source ofquinine, and the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), was lauded by fellowbotanists. His research brought wealth to the colonialists, led to new cures andtechnologies, and enhanced the storehouse of Western knowledge.Spruce first learned about ayahuasca in 1851, while with the Tukano Indians ofRío Vapes in northern Brazil and Colombia. He was invited to a special event –“a feast of gifts” full of song, dance and five generous helpings of theBanisteriopsis ayahuasca brew. It’s possible this brew had no DMT-containingadmixture. Spruce experienced no visions but intense nausea:I had gone with the full intention of experimenting the caapi myself, but I hadscarcely dispatched one cup of the nauseous beverage, which is but half thedose, when the ruler of the feast … came up with a woman bearing a largecalabash of caxiri (mandioca beer), of which I must needs take a copiousdraught, and as I know the mode of its preparation, it was gulped down withsecret loathing. (From his 1908 Notes of a Botanist on the Amazon and Andes.)He was then made to smoke “a large cigar 2 feet long and as thick as the wrist …I who had never in my life smoked a cigar or a pipe of tobacco”, followed by alarge cup of palm wine. The effect of mingling these substances “was a stronginclination to vomit, which was only overcome by lying down in a hammock anddrinking a cup of coffee”.Spruce encountered widespread use of ayahuasca in the region. As theethnobotanist Dennis McKenna recounts in his 1998 article “Ayahuasca: AnEthnopharmacologic History”: “Seven years later, Spruce again encountered thesame liana in use among the Guahibo Indians on the upper Orinoco of Colombia andVenezuela.” He also found “the Záparo Indians of Andean Peru taking a narcoticbeverage, prepared from the same plant, which they called ayahuasca”. In thelate 19th century, McKenna continues, many explorers and botanists reported onthe use of “an intoxicating beverage prepared by various indigenous Amazoniancommunities, and purportedly prepared from the ‘roots’ (Crévaux, 1883), ofvarious ‘shrubs’ (Koch-Grünberg, 1909) or ‘lianas’ (Rivet, 1905) of uncertainbotanical provenance”. In 1886, an explorer documented “use of ayahuasca amongstEcuadorian Indians, noting that they ‘drank ayahuasca mixed with yage, samerujaleaves, and guanto wood, an indulgence which usually results in a broil [brawl]between at least the partakers of the beverage’.”In his initial scientific effort, Spruce incorrectly identified the vine asBanisteria caapi. In 1931 a taxonomist corrected this, reclassifying it as amember of the Banisteriopsis, a flowering plant family. Approximately 92distinct Banisteriopsis species have been identified in Ecuador, Brazil,Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. As far as we know, only caapi produces suchvisionary effects, and thus deserves to be called “the queen of the forest”.Spruce pressed the samples of the mysterious psychoactive plants across the seaand sent them to the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens, where they lay dormantalongside other flora from around the world.The various alkaloids that give ayahuasca its visionary fizz were first isolatedby a German chemist in the middle of the 19th century, a period of “feverishalkaloid discovery”, McKenna notes. Harmaline, from the seeds of Syrian rue, wasidentified in 1841, and harmine was also discovered in the same seeds a fewyears later. McKenna writes:Harmine, like the other ß-carbolines named after the species epithet of Peganumharmala, would later turn out to be identical to the major ß-carboline found inBanisteriopsis caapi; the definitive establishment of the equivalence of theayahuasca ß-carboline to harmine from Syrian rue however, would not take placeuntil the 1920s, after harmine had been independently isolated by severalinvestigators and given a variety of names.Interestingly, in the 1920s, another chemist isolated harmine but gave it thename, “telepathine”.Harvard ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes followed in Spruce’s footsteps,becoming the most important ethnobotanical explorer of the 20th century. WadeDavis, who, like Schultes, studied ethnobotany at Harvard, wrote about hispredecessor’s investigations in his book One River (1996). Schultes did fieldwork with the Kofán in the 1950s. From them, he learned, in Davis’s account,that… yagé was far more than a shamanic tool; it is the source of wisdom itself, theultimate medium of knowledge for the entire society. To drink yagé is to learn.It is the vehicle by which each person acquires power and direct experience ofthe divine.Another crucial figure in the early exploration of ayahuasca was theanthropologist Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, whose life spanned most of the 20thcentury. Born in Austria in 1912, Reichel-Dolmatoff emigrated from Germany toColombia in the 1930s, where he lived until his death in 1994. He studied thecustoms of the Kogi Indians in Colombia, writing the first monographs on thesemountain-dwelling people whose ritual life circles around the use of cocaleaves. Reichel-Dolmatoff found the Kogi to be “a very complex culture,comparable only to the advanced societies of Mesoamerica”. He then becamefascinated by an indigenous group of rainforest communities, speaking the Tukanolanguage, from the northwest Colombian Amazon. He found that the Tukano-speakingcultures were rapidly disappearing under missionary pressure, as well as “thelabour conditions” imposed on them by the dominant Colombian society.Reichel-Dolmatoff realized that the Tukanoan culture “contained thoughtpatterns, psychological insights and adaptive mechanisms which clearlyconstituted major intellectual efforts a knowledge of which might greatly enrichour own civilization”. He hoped that anthropology, by revealing the value ofthese vanishing traditions “would be able to take a leading part in redressingthe balance which had been upset by ignorance, bigotry, and greed”. Oneessential component of their culture was the psychedelic experience provided bypsychotropic plants, in particular the ayahuasca vine:The importance of hallucinatory drugs is all-pervading in Desana society and inshamanistic ideology. The drug experience is not only a personal quest fortranscendency, but it is a dimension of existence which is just as valid as thatof our so-called everyday reality.Reichel-Dolmatoff found that the use of Banisteriopsis in “collective ritualoccasion” allowed the Tukano men to experience their mythology, by making directcontact with these other realities:During their trance states the men see themselves returning to the mythical Timeof Creation: they see themselves travelling inside the anaconda canoe, visitingfalls and pools, hills and caves, all the sacred landmarks of Time and Space.They will relive the Creation of Man in the turbulent womb of the Lake of Milk;they will die and be reborn at Ipanore, and over the din and confusion of danceand song they will hear the Sun Father’s stick rattle, on His search for thecentre, for the precise spot where mankind would at last find its dwellingplace. In their flight they will leave behind the sublunary sphere and penetratebeyond the Milky Way, into other landscapes and time dimensions.Reichel-Dolmatoff was a rare modern European investigator able to enter into thephenomenological world of the indigenous people while maintaining scientificrigour. Decades before we realized the extent of the imminent existential riskcaused by the ecological crisis, he understood that the cultures of the Amazonhad developed a symbiosis with their natural environs that offered crucial cluesfor the survival of industrial civilization. The basic principle of Tukanoculture, he found, was “cooperative behavior aimed at the conservation ofecological balance as the ultimately desirable quality”, as he wrote in anessay, “Cosmology as Ecological Analysis: A View from the Rainforest” (1976).Each Community member is “conscious that he forms part of a complex network ofinteractions” that extends to plants, animals, and to “all biotic and non-bioticcomponents of the environment”. Reichel-Dolmatoff knew that, due to timing andcircumstance, he was privileged to have unique access to these fragile cultures,soon to be eclipsed and in many cases extinguished by modern industrialcivilization. Like Schultes, he made it his responsibility to preserve what hecould of their knowledge and traditions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE YAGÉ ORGANIn 1953, avant-garde novelist William S Burroughs was not yet the ghostly iconof the bohemian counterculture he would later become. Nearly 40 years old atthat point, he was still unknown to the publishing world, an overage trust-fundbrat, also a heroin addict and homosexual who accidentally shot his wife throughthe head, killing her instantly, while playing their version of William Tell.Unable to kick his junk habit, guilt-ridden, crestfallen and junk-sick,Burroughs travelled down to Colombia in search of yagé. He had heard that yagéwas “the ultimate fix” – as well as a miracle cure for addiction. The Amazon wasnot yet a popular destination for psychedelic thrill seekers (“ayahuascatourism” was not even an idea at that point). His suitcase packed withsnake-bite serum, penicillin, a hammock and anti-diarrhoea medication, Burroughsmade his way – by bus, mule and canoe – down the Putumayo River, to the town ofMocoa, where he imbibed his first brackish cup of the elusive Amazonian brew.After a number of misadventures as well as a chance meeting with the legendaryethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, Burroughs found his way to the hut of acurandero. In his first session with the vine, Burroughs’ enthusiasm quicklyturned to despair. He later described his first journey as “sheer horror”,producing “the most complete derangement of the senses”. In his visions, heexplored decadent apocalyptic cities marked by violence, death, plague andfestering corruption. He received none of the healing insights or cheerfullife-coaching from the spirit that has now become commonplace in trip reports.Yet, courageously, Burroughs didn’t give up. He went back for more.In subsequent journeys, he encountered a profusion of visionary mayhem:Tithonian longevity serum; black marketers of World War III, pitchmen sellingremedies for radiation sickness, investigators of infractions denounced by blandparanoid chess players, servers of fragmentary warrants charging unspeakablemutilations of the spirit taken down in hebephrenic shorthand, bureaucrats ofspectral departments … Larval entities waiting for a live one.In the end he called yagé “a place where the unknown past and the emergentfuture meet in a vibrating soundless hum”.In 1963, Burroughs’ correspondence with his friend, the poet Allen Ginsberg,from which these extracts come, were published in The Yage Letters. Theircorrespondence detailed the murky psychotropic mindscapes encountered by theunwitting beatniks in their search for mystical gnosis – what Ginsberg called inhis poem Howl, “the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in themachinery of night”. Their trip reports remind us of what it was like to meetthe vine of souls before any New Age gloss or sentimental halo of nature worshipor Gaian connectivity suffused the journey.Ginsberg recalled in The Yage Letters the journey he himself made with the vinea few years after Burroughs:I felt faced by Death, my skull in my beard on pallet and porch rolling back andforth and settling finally as if in reproduction of the last physical move Imake before settling into real death – got nauseous, rushed out and beganvomiting, all covered with snakes, like a Snake Seraph, colored serpents inaureole all around my body, I felt like a snake vomiting out the universe …The letters suggest that both Ginsberg and Burroughs, after several sessions,managed to assimilate the more twisted and torturous aspects of the yagé trip toreach some semblance of inner resolution. The visions left an imprint onBurroughs’ Naked Lunch (1959) and other books. His depictions of turbulentcities and surrealistic war zones read like yagé flashbacks.The Beat generation writers were not just psychedelic tourists but consciousnesspioneers who approached their exploration of altered states with the dedicationof scientists making an experiential inquiry. From The Yage Letters, one getsthe lingering impression that these early psychonauts found their forays intoAmazonian shamanism more shell-shocking than illuminating. “This almostschizophrenic alteration of consciousness is fearful,” Ginsberg admitted. “I hadarrangements to bring [yagé] back to NY but I am almost afraid to – I’m lostmyself, and afraid of giving a nightmare I can’t stop to others …”By drinking yagé and writing about their journeys, Burroughs and Ginsberg playeda role in a larger story: a saga of early pioneers, meeting the visionary vineof souls and intentionally or inadvertently aiding its escape from itsprimordial home in the rainforest. This drama continues today, as ayahuascaextends its tendrils into our contemporary, globalized world. Televisiontalk-show hosts like Chelsea Handler film themselves under its influence;innumerable books and films explore Amazonian shamanism and its discontents;mainstream magazines like Harper’s Bazaar, GQ, Vanity Fair and the New Yorkerseek to categorize and parse the phenomenon as another fashionable trend.In the mainstream media, journalists reporting on ayahuasca over the past decadeor two tend to follow a similar trajectory. The articles usually begin with thewriter maintaining a smug superior distance from the phenomenon. They end withrevelation, retching and reconsideration. Writing about the subjectiveexperience of an ayahuasca journey is an invitation for an author to try theirbest Hunter S Thompson impression, as Ted Mann did for Vanity Fair in 2011:I hear the shaman start to sing; I hear his rattle; the words of his icaros formchains which are incorporated into delicate symbolic arabesques in visions thatevolve like life-forms in a world where film with resolution indistinguishablefrom reality is shot at a speed of one frame a century. Every detail of a vastcliff face, an open-pit mine, composed of copulating salamanders, is presentedand recognized and responsive to sound continuously evolving, by what seems likea logical progression, into the detailed hues of the internal organs – thismakes me vomit. The visions recede, briefly, and as I pant and drool over aconvenient plastic bucket, I feel better. The visions resume with newcomers,self-dissecting aliens presenting themselves, and their internal anatomy, in theturning pages of an abnormal-physiology textbook, published on sheets offundamental matter, quarks and gluons, massless constituents of theinfinitesimal, actually becoming the things they appear to represent. An errantthought, “At least I haven’t seen any snakes”, flickers in my mind, and can’t betaken back, and now is, of course, no longer true. I am invested withintertwined squirming serpents, some slithering kraits, a club-bodied Gaboonviper, a mass of obscenely active serpents in primary colors, some jokers thatmimic a barber pole, another brown and lumpy like an old Mars bar, and amustache cup of albino worms that invade my nostrils, making for the brain. Iresolve to believe they are conducting overdue repairs, and I wish them well asI sense them at their business throughout my body.Not for all but for some journalists, the traumatic turbulence of an ayahuascajourney temporarily suspends critical distance and cynicism. Over time, writershave developed a set of familiar tropes to describe the visions unleashed by themedicine. This includes Mann’s “self-dissecting aliens” – a homage or riff onTerence McKenna’s DMT description of “selftransforming machine elves”. It is anamusing anthropological game to watch authors and celebrities try to assimilateand spin their unmediated direct experiences of the unpresentable, unfathomableand sometimes unbearable into something that their audience can assimilate andenjoy.In One River Wade Davis followed the path of Schultes’ journeys across therainforest, living with communities, exploring their practices and collectingtheir botanical knowledge. Much of what Schultes learned about traditional useof the medicine goes against the current cultural mythology surrounding it,which sees it as something only to be taken in group ceremonies presided over bya shaman. This construct is a relatively recent invention. Davis recounts:When Schultes asked the shaman how often the people drank yagé his responsesuggested the question had no meaning: during illness, of course, and in thewake of death; in times of need or hardship; at certain passages in life; when ayoung boy of six has his initial haircut or when he kills for the first time …And naturally, the shaman suggested, a youth will drink yagé at puberty … as ayoung man he may drink it at his leisure to improve his hunting technique orsimply to flaunt his physical prowess. The message that Schultes received wasthat the Kofan took yagé whenever they felt like it – at least once a week andno doubt on any occasion that warranted it.The anthropologist Michael Harner – a critical figure in the moderndissemination of knowledge on ayahuasca and shamanism – did his fieldwork withthe Shuar. In an interview entitled “My Path in Shamanism” (2005) he said thatthe shamans he worked with “felt strongly that normally only one person at atime should take ayahuasca, otherwise the contact with the spirits would bediluted or altered”. This belief is the opposite of modern ceremonies where 20or more people will all drink together, under a shaman’s watchful eye.A graduate of Berkeley, Harner initially intended to be an archaeologist untilhe “found that the Indians living nearby were like encyclopedias that nobody wasopening, and this alerted me to the incredible amount of knowledge that wasavailable just by asking the tribal elders”. He did his doctoral dissertation onfieldwork with the Shuar in the late 1950s. “I suddenly found myself in asociety of shamans. About one out of every four adult males and a much smallerproportion of females were shamans.” He learned about ayahuasca from them, butdidn’t try it himself until 1960, while studying with Konibo people in Pucallpa,Peru. “I was attempting to get information on their spiritual system,” herecalled later. “The Konibo said there’s only one way to learn about it – you’vegot to take the drink. So I took the drink.”That first journey has become part of modern ayahuasca lore – a foundationalmyth for a burgeoning global community. Up until that point, anthropologistsmaintained careful critical distance from the spiritual practices of indigenouspeople. For example, for the famed French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss,the patterns traced upon the skin of the Amazonian communities he studied evokedthe social complexity they might have developed, if they had become ascosmopolitan as Parisian intellectuals, instead of remaining immersed in theirjungle cosmology. Lévi-Strauss never considered that these patterns, like thekené patterns covering Shipibo fabrics, might reflect, instead, their directexperience of a visionary reality, accessed through plant compounds.When Schultes drank yagé he saw only colours. When Harner drank, he received acomplete transmission from the shamanic multiverse – a vision that transformedhis life and influenced perspectives on ayahuasca since that time. At one point,as he writes in his book, The Way of the Shaman (1980), Harner found himself ona boat with “large numbers of people with heads of blue jays and the bodies ofhumans, not unlike the bird-headed god of ancient Egyptian tomb paintings … Iwas completely certain that I was dying and that the bird-headed people had cometo take my soul away on the boat”. He encountered “giant reptilian creaturesreposing sluggishly at the lowermost depths of the back of my brain, where itmet the top of the spinal column.” A voice told him that these wereextraterrestrials resembling giant pterodactyls who came to Earth aeons ago,escaping their enemies:They had created life on the planet in order to hide within the multitudinousforms and thus disguise their presence … They were the true masters of humanityand the entire planet, they told me. We humans were but the receptacles andservants of these creatures.After the journey, he met with missionaries who pointed out the similaritybetween his visions and passages from the Book of Revelation: “And the greatdragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, whichdeceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth and his angels withhim.” But Harner was more impressed when he spoke with a blind old Koniboshaman. When he relayed his visions of these bat-winged aliens who controlledlife on Earth, the shaman “stared up toward me with his sightless eyes, and saidwith a grin, ‘Oh, they’re always saying that. But they are only the Masters ofOuter Darkness’.”Harner suddenly realized, with amazement, that this shaman possessed a thoroughknowledge of these invisible worlds or dimensions. While these other worlds didnot exist for the modern West, they could be accessed directly through alteredstates. “From that moment on I decided to learn everything I could aboutshamanism.” He later established a school of shamanic studies, applying academicrigour to understand and explicate the multidimensional worldview common toshamanic cultures across the world.Harner became a shamanic practitioner as well as an articulate proponent of thevalidity of the shamanic worldview, exploring many cross-cultural archetypes. Inthe long retrospective interview with UCLA behavioural scientist Charles Groband Australian psychiatrist Roger Walsh, “My Path in Shamanism”, published inHigher Wisdom (2005) by Grob and Walsh, he defines a spirit as:… an animate essence that has intelligence and different degrees of power. It isseen most easily in complete darkness and much less frequently in bright light,and in an altered state of consciousness better than in an ordinary state. Infact, there’s some question whether you can see it in an ordinary state ofconsciousness at all.The role of the shaman is to be the intercessor between the spirit dimensionsand this reality. Harner believed thatcompassionate, healing spirits have a mission to try to communicate theirexistence to us so that they can get on with their work of trying to reducesuffering and pain in our reality … But they are in one reality and we’re inanother reality, and the only way they can penetrate this reality, except invery rare circumstances, is with help from our side.His shamanic journeys also freed him from any fear of death:I no longer view ordinary reality as the only reality. There’s a whole otherreality, and that reality is the bigger one. This one is just a transitoryexperience; you’re only here for a certain number of years, but the other one isinfinite … it’s ineffable ecstasy and union … This material world is basicallyjust a short pit stop.As Harner defined in his work, shamanism posits three worlds – Upper, Middle,Lower – which the shaman can move between in visionary trance. Our Earthly planebelongs to the Middle World, which has many kinds of spirit intermediariesflowing through it.The Upper and Lower, above and below us, are completely in nonordinary reality,and beyond pain and suffering. In contrast, the Middle World, in which we live,has both its ordinary and nonordinary aspects.Harner found that the yagé-drinking communities he practised with relateddifferently with the spiritual cosmos. For example, the Shuar were “very muchinvolved with Middle World spirits … These can be spirits of any beings:animals, insects, or humans.” Black magic was rampant among the Shuar, as Harnernoted: “A culture that is stuck with Middle World spirits is a culture that isgoing to have sorcery.” The Konibo shamans, on the other hand, manifested farless “aggressive behavior,” because they made “much travel to the Upper andLower Worlds in their shamanic journeys.”Harner ultimately made a complete transition from university anthropologist toshamanic practitioner speaking openly about spirits and other realities. Sincethe 1960s, a number of other thinkers and writers managed to straddle the linebetween academic rigour and other-worldly proselytizer. Where earlierresearchers focused on the traditional lives of indigenous cultures in therainforest, anthropologists like Marlene Dobkin de Rios, Michael Taussig andBeatriz Labate have studied the impact of ayahuasca on urban communities and itsassimilation into mestizo and modern European culture.Taussig, an anthropologist at Columbia University, wrote about ayahuasca use inthe Putumayo region of Colombia in his book Shamanism, Colonialism, and the WildMan (1987). He drank yagé dozens of times with Santiago Mutumbajoy, a Colombianshaman. Of his first journey, he wrote:I looked back and I saw this tiger sitting in a hammock. Body of a human andfeet and legs in pants, the trunk was in-between, but the head – all thesestripes and hair hanging down – a tiger sitting in a hammock. I looked away andit was a shaman; I looked back and it was a tiger. And then I vomited. Vomitedlike hell.What most intrigued Taussig about ayahuasca was its capacity to break apartordered categories of thought, static perceptions and ideologies:The yagé experience is always something you can return to (insofar as you canremember it) to re-think all these very basic questions, because you’ve been sopulled apart and because such unusual mixtures of sensations have occurred. Inpart it’s like having another sense organ opened up, in addition to having eyes,ears, taste, skin, genitalia – now there’s the yagé organ too, and it blaststhrough consciousness, the exquisite intellectual being of one’s self as well.The phenomenology of the ayahuasca experience fascinated the cognitivepsychologist Benny Shanon, a professor of psychology at the Hebrew University ofJerusalem. Shanon first learned about ayahuasca in 1983, while on a hike throughthe Ecuadorian rainforest. It was 8 years later, during his first Santo Daimeceremony in Brazil, that he finally experienced ayahuasca’s phantasmagoriceffects. As he wrote in his book The Antipodes of the Mind (2002), he was takenon an accelerated visionary tour through human history:There were slaves rowing a Roman boat … slaves chained to their seats, and thelabour was hard. Yet, it suddenly occurred to me in their debased position inthe lower deck the slaves were, in some sense, freer than their masters who weretrapped in their games of power and social status … they were closer to theDivine than their masters were.His visions brought him to the Nazi Holocaust where 8 million Jews, gypsies, andother minorities died in the concentration camps. Under the effects of themedicine, he accessed revelatory insights on evil and justice, destiny andredemption, gaining “a new understanding of both the killers and the victims …it seemed to me that the victims were given the opportunity to reach the highestlevels of faith”.From that first ceremony, Shanon made the connection between religious mysticismand entheogens. The next morning, he gazed into the forest. It felt to him as ifhe had returned to the first day of creation:I had a glimpse of a heavenly scene, and it seemed to me that the righteous werethose who, according to Jewish legend, eat the meat of the great Leviathan. Ialso had a glimpse of Jesus on the cross.Shanon arrived at the Amazon as a self-proclaimed “devout atheist”. This was nolonger the case when he left.Shanon’s inexplicably startling visions inspired him to undertake a massiveresearch project on the phenomenology of the ayahuasca experience. He comparedhundreds of accounts made by drinkers on the various physical sensations,intimations and visionary revelations they experience through drinking themedicine. The results of the study were published in his aforementioned andbrilliant book, The Antipodes of the Mind. “Ayahuasca introduces one to therealms that pertain to religion, to faith, to the Divine,” he wrote.Shanon began his inquiry in the spirit of science, open to a reductive andpurely material explanation for the repeating motifs and images – the “cognitiveuniversals” he found cross-culturally in ayahuasca visions:A reductionist would argue that the commonalities in the ayahuasca experienceare directly due to neuroanatomical structures and brain processes and henceshould be explained in biological terms.But this reductive viewpoint proved unsatisfying:Would we say, for example, that the reoccurrence of visual elements such asserpents and jaguars, palaces and works of art are due to there being specificbrain centers in which such information is stored?Through his research, Shanon’s viewpoint shifted from a reductionist view toembrace Carl Jung’s postulate that there must be something like a “collectiveunconscious”, a repository of images and myths that exist beyond the boundariesof our individual minds, which we can access in visionary experience. He wasintrigued, also, by Aldous Huxley’s idea that we value precious stones “becausein some way they remind us of something which is already there in our minds”.Somewhere we are vaguely aware of a “paradisal, more-than-real world” at the“back of our heads”, accessible, to most people, in occasional fleetingglimpses.Shanon proposes:If the commonalities in the ayahuasca experience cannot be accounted for inordinary psychological terms, then perhaps we have no choice but to shift fromthe internal domain to the external one and consider the possibility that thesecommonalities reflect patterns exhibited on another, extra-human realm.His training as a cognitive psychologist ultimately leads him to wide-rangingmetaphysical speculations on the nature of reality itself, as the ayahuascapotion seems to playfully reveal it. He notes “the supernatural, paranormalnature of the other realities seen in visions”, and the sense that drinkers havethat the medicine “brings those who partake of it to realms that are notdependent on time”. In these other dimensions of reality, journeyers oftenbelieve “that all that has been known and all that will be known is copresentand potentially available for people in the visionary state to access”. Shanon’ssummary of the medicine’s transcendent and transpersonal effect – the intuitionit imparts of a pre-existing dimension beyond what we know as time – calls tomind Corinthians in the Bible: “For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be doneaway.”In the 1980s anthropologist Jeremy Narby was doing fieldwork in the Amazon whenhe drank ayahuasca with the Asháninka in Peru. Much like Harner, he hadvisionary experiences that challenged his scientific certainties and ultimatelytransformed his understanding of the world. In a vision, Narby encountered twoenormous twined serpents who scoffed at him and told him he knew nothing aboutthe true nature of reality. Later on, Narby discovered ancient serpentineimagery from cultures around the world. In The Cosmic Serpent (1998), headvanced a hypothesis that, through ayahuasca, we can access images emitted asphotons by the crystalline structure of our DNA. This idea remainsscientifically unverified, but it is one attempt to build a bridge between therealms of science and shamanism.Narby has continued his investigation into the intelligence of nature insubsequent books and projects. In 1999, he helped organize a journey to theAmazon for three molecular biologists to see whether they could obtainbio-molecular information in the visions they had in sessions with an indigenousshaman. Under the influence of the medicine, the scientists asked specificquestions related to their fields of study. They received intriguingly specificanswers.One of the biologists worked with the tobacco gene. During her journey,according to Narby’s essay “Shamans and scientists”, she spoke with an entitythat identified itself as “the mother of tobacco” who told her that tobacco’sfundamental role was “to serve all living beings”. She wanted to know if it waswrong to modify the DNA of the plant. In her visions, she was shown:… a resplendent plant growing in a desert thanks to an extra gene which allowedit to resist drought. She came away from this experience with the understandingthat genetic manipulations were best gauged case by case, in a way that takesinto consideration the scientist’s intention as well as the way in which themodified plants will be used by society.Writing on the results of this experiment, Narby admits the evidence wasinconclusive:All three said the experience of ayahuasca shamanism changed their way oflooking at themselves and at the world, as well as their appreciation of thecapacities of the human mind. They all expressed great respect for the shaman’sskill and knowledge.But all of the information received was, they believed, already present in theirminds in some form. Nothing they saw proved to them they were interacting withan outside intelligence. They also found the ceremonies to be hard work.“Ayahuasca is not a shortcut to the Nobel prize,” one of the scientists quipped.While that may be true, the more that scientists study ayahuasca, the more theyare learning about its extraordinary properties. One scientist in Catalonia,Jordi Riba, has discovered that ayahuasca causes neurogenesis - the regrowth ofbrain cells - in the laboratory. This could have tremendous implications fortreating Alzheimer’s and other conditions.What seems to be the case is that we have reached a new cultural threshold. Wecan understand the value of ayahuasca within the indigenous and mestizotraditions that have preserved it until now. We can also understand its risksand dangers in a more comprehensive way. At the same time, many mysteries remain– philosophical, ethical, biological as well as metaphysical ones. In thefuture, we have the opportunity to take everything we have already learned tohelp us make the most beneficial use of this medicine, while we seek to explorethe questions it still poses for us."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6ORIGINSSuccessive generations of European anthropologists encountered ayahuasca in the20th century, making it a subject for investigation and scholarship. Even so,after decades of investigation many basic questions remain unanswered. Forexample, we don’t know how jungle communities originally learned how to make theayahuasca brew. We also don’t know how long ago the indigenous people found thatthe admixture of the vine and the leaf, cooked together, would produce suchpotent visionary effects.There are more than 40,000 plants catalogued in the Amazon rainforest.Considering this, it’s hard to imagine that anyone – no matter how attuned tothe sensuous undercurrents of the forest and its magic – would have thought tocombine together a DMT-containing plant with the ayahuasca vine. It seems faroutside the realm of luck or improvisation. The DMT in chacruna is onlypsychoactive when taken along with an MAOI-containing plant such as B. caapi.The ayahuasca brew requires many hours to prepare as well as the addition of anacidifying element to reach the proper pH balance. Was the discovery of thisbrew a gift, a lucky accident, or a testament to the mastery of rainforestscience?According to some legends, the ayahuasca vine visited rainforest shamans intheir dreams, giving them instruction on how to prepare it. Quechua lore has itthat the jaguar, once seen drunkenly stumbling and staring into space afterchewing on the caapi lianas, is responsible for revealing to humans thepsychoactive effect of ayahuasca. For the Asháninka community and others, it’ssaid to be a gift from their creator god (rainforest communities can be bothpantheistic and monotheistic without finding any inherent contradiction betweenthese ideas).Indigenous people possess levels of botanical sensitivity that are beyond ourscientific understanding. Richard Schultes, for example, found that therainforest shamans were able to immediately recognize and categorize differentkinds of ayahuasca based on their particular effects in ceremony. Even though hewas a trained botanist, he could find no visible difference between thespecimens.According to Dennis McKenna in his essay “Ayahuasca: An EthnophamacologicHistory”, published in Ralph Metzner’s The Ayahuasca Experience (2014): “Thereis nothing in the form of iconographic materials or preserved botanical remainsthat would unequivocally establish the prehistoric use of ayahuasca.” Across theglobal community of ayahuasqueros and neo-shamans, it is commonly supposed thatindigenous people consumed the ayahuasca potion in the same way for untoldcenturies.In The Cosmic Serpent, Jeremy Narby wrote that Amazonian communities practisedayahuasca shamanism “without interruption for at least five thousand years”.Dennis McKenna believed that ayahuasca had been imbibed for “millennia ofcoevolution”. Benny Shanon, in The Antipodes of the Mind, supposes ayahuasca“has long been a key constituent of culture” in the Amazon basin. “Indeed, itappears that the indigenous people of this region have used the brew formillennia.” Yet this is only speculation.The presumed ancient provenance somehow adds significance and value to itscontinued and ongoing use. Europeans and North Americans tend to see ayahuascaand Amazonian curanderismo as an ancient, archaic and primitive practice - andthus a pure and “uncorrupted” tradition. Contemporary first-generation drinkersbelieve that the ancient pedigree of the medicine gives it authenticity,authority and special significance.Underpinning these assumptions is the implicit belief that indigenous culturesare unchanging and primordial – that, somehow, they’ve been unscathed by thetides of time, despite the rise and fall of empires, environmental changes andsocial dynamics we may not understand as of yet. Part of the reason for this isthat indigenous communities, until recently, transferred all of their knowledgeand history orally.Pervasive in Western culture is the implicit belief that indigenous cultures aremore static, less innovative and adaptive, than our own. At the same time, thepresumed ancient pedigree of the medicine somehow gives it authenticity,authority and significance. It is an interesting thought experiment to challengesuch assumptions or at least explore their foundations. Some anthropologists arecurrently questioning the romantic ahistoricism that surrounds ayahuasca andother Amazonian shamanic practices. The untested belief that ayahuasca shamanismis a static practice may create a distorted view of indigenous culturalhistories. Many modern Westerners want these cultures to be unsullied,unchanging, pure, and natural – that way, they provide a clear antithesis orantidote to our own society.Stephan Beyer, author of Singing to the Plants (2009), finds no mention of themodern ayahuasca brew before the 18th century – by European colonialists or byprevious Empires. He reviews circumstantial evidence such as the lack of anyreference to ayahuasca in the detailed records of the Inca Empire, whichconquered much of modern-day Peru and Ecuador in the 14th century:By the late 1400s the Inca Empire, under the Supreme Inca Pachacuti, had reachedEcuador, and presumably would have encountered the ayahuasca drink had it beenin use there. The Incas had acute observational skills and a keen interest inplants, their growing conditions, and their local uses, yet there is no Incamaterial that shows familiarity with anything like either the ayahuasca vine orthe ayahuasca drink, and there is no sign of ayahuasca use or the memory of itsuse among highland Indians.Early European chroniclers were fascinated by the indigenous use of psychoactiveplants, although mainly to denigrate them as the devil’s tools. In 1571, theSpanish explorer Polo de Ondergardo recorded the use of vilca, a snuffcontaining tobacco and the crushed DMT-containing seeds of Anadenantheraperegrina. But there was no mention of the ayahuasca potion. In the 16th and17th centuries, Beyer notes:Spanish missionary priests wrote vivid and horrified descriptions of the effectsof snuffed DMT-containing Anadenanthera, as well as the snuffing and drinking oftobacco, but no similar accounts of ayahuasca.We find early mentions in the chronicles of the Jesuit Franz Xavier Veigl(1768), who writes of the “so-called ayahuasca, which is a bitter reed, or morespecifically, a liana. It serves for mystification and bewitchment”. Yet thismay refer to the vine alone, not the admixture. While we now see the Shipibopeople as one of the central groups involved in the technical mastery ofayahuasca as a healing medicine, even 19th-century descriptions of Shipibohealing ceremonies don’t mention the potion.The anthropologists Bernd Brabec de Mori and Oscar Calavia Saéz, in theirresearch into the medicine’s origins, did not discover anything to support theclaims for ancient use of the DMT-containing ayahuasca brew. “Unfortunately,there is still no evidence found to back up the assumption that ayahuasca hasbeen used since pre-Columbian times,” writes Brabec de Mori in his essay“Tracing Hallucinations”, published in the multi-author book TheInternationalization of Ayahuasca (2011). He proposes that “ayahuasca shamanism”was only introduced to the Peruvian lowlands recently, probably by mestizotravelers in urban areas. Similarly, the Matsigenka and Asháninka knew of B.caapi, but only mixed it with the vision-inducing P. viridis within the pastcentury, presumably learning how to do this from travellers. Beyer suggests:It becomes a plausible hypothesis that the ayahuasca drink – the combination ofthe ayahuasca vine with a DMT-containing companion plant – originated, not 5,000years ago, but rather much more recently, perhaps in the seventeenth century.Brabec de Mori develops a narrative of the medicine’s path into the Westernworld, proposing that the combination of the vine and the leaf was “discoveredby some Western Tukanoan people” and spread to the “Kichwaspeaking groups thatemerged from Jesuit missions in the Ecuadorian and northwest Peruvian lowlandsand among the Kukama”. Calavia Saéz recounts stories from the 1920s in which theKaxinawa Indians of Brazil attribute their knowledge of ayahuasca to theYaminawá, in relatively recent times. Brabec de Mori proposes that the practiceof drinking the ayahuasca potion (the vine plus the leaves) travelled in thelate 19th century or early 20th century from the area around the Amazonian rivercity of Iquitos:It then crossed the Brazilian frontier into Acre, where Indians and seringueiros[rubber tappers] started to use the brew, before the Santo Daime church wasfounded in the 1930s. Groups which then remained isolated came in touch withayahuasca only recently, that is, after their (renewed) contact to riverinesocieties.As an ethnomusicologist as well as an anthropologist, Brabec de Mori studies theicaros, the shamanic chants and medicine songs used across the region. Part ofhis argument for ayahuasca’s recent provenance rests on the tonal similaritiesof the icaros from different areas of the Amazon basin. He believes that, over along period of time, each tribal group would have developed a unique musicalapproach:The musical structure of icaro is the only song structure compellingly similarbetween the Río Napo and the Río Urubamba … If ayahuasca would be in use forcenturies or even millennia among the mentioned groups, as it is often assumed …it would appear rather illogical that especially the music connected toayahuasca sessions would be the only music fairly similar among all the groups.… The only reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that this music israther new and was distributed among these groups from the same source.But Brabec de Mori understates the differences in traditional icaros and chants.The whooping haunting atonal hums the Secoya sing in yagé nights bear littleresemblance to the precise, melodious and methodical vibrations sung by Shipiboonanya (healers). Farther north in the Putumayo region, taitas (esteemedspiritual leaders and yagé servers) chant similarly to the Secoya, yet oftenadopt guitars and other instruments into their ceremonial spaces. Farther southin the outskirts of cities, ayahuasca songs have a more melodic structure,marked by a beginning, a middle, a chorus and an end – definitely due tooccidental influences. The hymns sung in the illuminated halls of UDV or SantoDaime processions reveal the many historical layers of ayahuasca shamanism as itis practised across the Amazon.Whenever exactly the vine and the leaves were first brewed to create the potionwe know today, the dissemination of ayahuasca appears to have been a much moresyncretic and modernist phenomenon than previously thought. Use of the medicinespread through new forms of contact between tribal groups. Ironically, these newcomminglings were the result of colonialism, missionaries and rubber tappingconcessions. Peyote, similarly, was originally used in a small area of thesouthwestern United States. It spread to many North American indigenous groupsin the late 19th and 20th centuries, through the medium of the Native AmericanChurch.There is something liberating about this counter-narrative, rejecting theahistorical narrative that ayahuasca has been used in the same way formillennia. If this is the case, we no longer need to see current experimentationwith ayahuasca as inherently wrong or an aberration, as long as the medicine istreated with respect. Instead, today’s innovators experimenting with themedicine are not “apostates” or “heretics” rebelling against the presumed purityof an ancient lineage. They continue a dynamic process of discovery andexploration – probably in the same way that shamans, “technicians of thesacred,” to use Mircea Eliade’s term – always have. Overcoming the idea ofayahuasca use as something fixed, ancient and pure, we can understand ayahuascashamanism as a practice – an applied science – that continually changes as itevolves.Beyer believes that the claims for ayahuasca’s ancient provenance is, on the onehand, an attempt to legitimate ayahuasca use by invoking “the culturallyresonant trope of a millennia-old indigenous wisdom”. Westerners often imaginetribal people as ahistorical, “unchanging in their isolation and innocence”. Hebelieves that both reasons “malign the creativity, adaptability, and ingenuityof indigenous cultures”.The indigenous groups that use ayahuasca in the Amazon tend to leave no tracesfrom the past. The forest quickly swallows any human-made objects back into itsmaw. The Secoya, for example, traditionally constructed their dwellings out ofrainforest wood and vines. No residue or relic would remain, even ahalf-generation later. They may have drunk ayahuasca for 8,000 years – but therewould be no remnant of this older than the last living elder’s memory.Even in the past 50 years, the typical contexts for drinking ayahuasca havechanged significantly. In the ayahuasca ceremony most people know today, theshaman or curandero gives ayahuasca to 20 or so people (many of them strangers).They all drink it together. Then the curandero makes music, sings over them, andperforms healings. As journalist Ariel Levy wrote in The New Yorker in 2016:Most people who take ayahuasca in the United States do so in small “ceremonies”,led by an individual who may call himself a shaman, an ayahuasquero, acurandero, a vegetalista, or just a healer. This person may have come fromgenerations of Shipibo or Quechua shamans in Peru, or he may just be someonewith access to ayahuasca.Generally, the drinkers sit still or lie down silently while the shaman presidesover the ritual, protecting the space and looking after the participants.While this modality has become common in the contemporary neo-shamanic world, itbears little resemblance to what was practised, for the most part, in theAmazon. Traditionally, in many cases, patients seeking healing throughcuranderismo would not be expected to drink ayahuasca or have visionsthemselves. The shaman would drink for them and seek to heal them while theywere in the visionary trance.As Calavia Saéz notes in “A Vine Network” in The Internationalization ofAyahuasca:… being cured through ayahuasca does not necessarily happen through anexperience by the sick person. Normally the central experience in the healingprocess is made by the shaman, not the patient.This is the reverse of current beliefs and practices. For example, Canadianphysician Gabor Maté believes that ayahuasca cures by surfacing repressedemotions in the sick person. Many now think that ayahuasca’s ability to healpsychological and even physical maladies is based on the insights and catharticemotional experiences it induces in the patient. Yet this is a modern inversionof the traditional approach, in which the shaman would receive the visions andseek to transform and release negative energies for his or her patient.If the increasingly widespread use of the DMT-containing ayahuasca potion is arelatively recent – even a modern phenomenon – then why do we presume it to besomething ancient? Brabec de Mori believes this is based on an inherent bias inmodern Western civilization. We “tend to connect ‘old’ with ‘precious’ andspecifically ‘indigenous,’ and correspondingly, ‘new’ with ‘invented,constructed, copied’.” Western seekers raised in industrial, secular societiesyearn to connect with an unsullied source of healing gnosis passed down throughthe ages.At the same time, for researchers and scholars, Brabec notes in “TracingHallucinations”:It makes a difference indeed whether we report to the public that we areinvestigating a hallucinogenic drug that was spread relatively recently throughCatholic missions and by rainforest mestizos, or whether we report that we areresearching a traditional remedy that has been used by forest Indians for atleast five thousand years.The postmodern spiritual culture of the West focuses on ayahuasca’s healingpowers, avoiding deeper layers of ambiguity, history, and in some cases,darkness. In older accounts, ayahuasca shows “a much more sinister property thanthe one that is attributed to it by the indianist new age,” notes Calavia Saéz.It is often an “agent of witchcraft” as well as “a catalyzer for mundane war”.Calavia Saéz explores the oral history of the Yaminawá. In their tales,neighbouring groups would come together to drink ayahuasca. These reunionssometimes turned “into sudden and lethal confrontations … The cipo [Yaminawáword for ayahuasca] would perform some kind of negative diplomacy by producingvisions in which their fellow celebrants were revealed to be enemies”. In othertales, ayahuasca “worked as a vehicle through which deceased relatives appear inorder to demand that their family take revenge upon their slayer”. The blood ofthe slain might be mixed into the potion to induce such visions.Some rainforest communities integrated ayahuasca into vibrant rituals thatinvolved dancing, celebration, as well as drinking alcohol (caxiri, beer madefrom manioc and palm wine) and consuming vast quantities of tobacco. These kindsof community rituals using the medicine have become a thing of the past acrossthe Amazon, Calavia Saéz finds. “Commonly, there has been a progressiveabandoning of collective use, whereas it continued or even increased in privateuse.” Reasons for this may include the intensifying impact of colonialism andmissionaries. Also the tendency of these celebrations to end in violentconflicts may have become reason to avoid them in a world changing quickly dueto modern industrialization and the influence of the West.Calavia Saéz sees the medicine as a protagonist in an “indianistcontraevangelism”, introducing indigenous elements and rituals “into thereligious world of the whites, not without these hybrids coming back for newhybridization”. Ayahuasca, he argues:… is not a chapter of shamanism or of culture, it is not a religion. Strictlyspeaking, ayahuasca isn’t anything, or, to put it this way, it is nothingspecial.The most he will say about it, from his strict anthropological viewpoint, isthat it “organizes networks” of cultural relationships and information.The truth is that we simply do not know when the ayahuasca brew we know todaywas first made, when DMT-containing admixtures were added to it, or by whom.Beyer writes in his essay “On the Origins of Ayahuasca” (2012):What is important about these arguments is that they allow us to infer a processof dynamic, innovative, and creative cultural interchange and adaptation over arelatively wide area over a period of perhaps hundreds of years. What they argueagainst is any idea that ayahuasca use has been widespread and static for fiftycenturies.This revisionist view means that contemporary experiments and new modalitiesbeing field-tested around the world are not necessarily iconoclastic. With themedicine, we find ourselves in an experimental, open-ended process ofengagement. In fact, indigenous practitioners also experiment. Over the past fewdecades, for example, “Eagle and Condor” ceremonies have become popular. Inthese ceremonies, indigenous shamans from different lineages come together tomix their medicines in rituals that celebrate the integration of the North andSouth. Frequently, these ceremonies will include ingesting ayahuasca with peyoteor San Pedro, and singing traditional ceremonial songs from the North and South.The Eagle and Condor refers to a set of prophecies, shared among many indigenousgroups in North and South America, that we are entering a new age of spiritualrealization and global communion. Interestingly, such prophecies may be modernadmixtures also, borrowing from Christian ideas of a collective Apocalypse andredemption.In regards to the origins of the ayahuasca brew, other students of Amazonianspiritual traditions counter the revisionist narrative that put its origins backin the 17th or 18th centuries. Matteo Norzi, Executive Director of theShipibo-Conibo center, notes:There have been a lot of prominent academics bringing forward the theory thatthe Shipibo started using ayahuasca very recently. But there’s another theory, amore archaeological, open-minded theory … which connects cultures in the Amazonwith the patterns they use. By looking at the shared patterns of pre-Colombiancommunities from western Peru to the prehistoric Marajoara community in easternBrazil, there’s a common, visionary motif in their artwork, called the“polychrome horizon style”.To Norzi, these uncanny DMT-esque motifs and patterns found throughout theregion suggest that these visionary states were accessed by many differentcultures across the continent, for a very long time.“The origins of the use of ayahuasca in the Amazon basin are lost in the mistsof prehistory,” Dennis McKenna writes in “Ayahuasca: An EthnopharmacologicHistory”.He continues:No one can say for certain where the practice may have originated, and about allthat can be stated with certainty is that it was already spread among numerousindigenous communities throughout the Amazon basin by the time ayahuasca came tothe attention of Western ethnographers in the mid-19th century. This fact aloneargues for its antiquity; beyond that, little is known.Through legends and oral tradition, the Shipibo, Asháninka and Secoya all assertthat their use of the medicine goes as far back as creation itself, but they canoffer no proof beyond living memory. Meanwhile, members of the União do Vegetalsyncretic Brazilian church say with full conviction that hoasca was a gift fromthe Hebrew King Solomon, to the Inca, whose golden fleets were the first todiscover the New World. As intriguing as this idea may be, no evidence supportsit. Perhaps fittingly, the origins of ayahuasca – like so much else about thisvision-producing medicine – remain a mystery."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOON CURANDERISMO"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7TOOLS OF TRANSFORMATIONOver the past few decades, the concept of the shaman – as cultural hero,visionary healer, psychopomp – has taken root in contemporary popular culture.But our current fascination with shamanism has a long history. The word “shaman”originally comes from the reindeer-herding nomads of the Siberian steppes. Inthe Tungus language, it denotes the spiritual leaders of the nomadic peopleindigenous to that region. The shaman was the visionary leader of the communitywho would enter into trance, bringing knowledge down from “other worlds”, thespirit realms, for healing, hunting or warfare. In Siberia, the mainpsychoactive plant traditionally used as an intoxicant and entheogen was Amanitamuscaria, the easily identifiable fly agaric mushroom having a red cap withwhite spots, which appears over and over again in cartoons and folklore. Thenomads must have had a secret method of preparation because, in contemporaryaccounts, Amanita muscaria reliably generates bad trips.In her thesis “From Medicine Men to Day Trippers: Shamanic Tourism in Iquitos,Peru” (2010), Evegenia Fotiou notes that Dutch and German explorers in the 18thcentury brought the concept of the shaman back home to Europe from Siberia.Later scholars suggested that the red and white fly agaric mushroom gave birthto the legend of Santa Claus, in his famous red-and-white outfit. TheTungus-speaking nomads herded reindeer. The intoxicants in fly agaricconcentrate in urine. Discovering this, the nomads would save their ownmushroom-tinged urine and drink it again when they wanted to reach a heightenedstate. They also found that the reindeers loved the flavour – and perhaps theeffect – of fly-agaric-flavoured urine. To bring the herd together, all they hadto do was pour some mushroom-scented-piss on the ground and reindeer wouldgallop over from miles around to lap it up. The archetype of a red-and-whitebeing bringing gifts from the other world, connected to herds of happy reindeer,was the Siberian nomads’ unwitting contribution to today’s global consumeristmonoculture.As 18th-century Europeans rediscovered shamanism, they romanticized the ideal ofthe colourful psychopomp who would enter into trance, bringing healing visionsfrom heaven to earth. The archetype of the colourfully robed shaman, whichEuropean explorers encountered in Siberia, ultimately fed into the developingconcept of the wizardly romantic genius – the great unworldly artist who drewtheir power from unseen forces and whose suffering labour redeemed society bygiving it a new vision. This shamanic ideal of the modern artist becameenshrined in the late 18th and 19th centuries with figures like Beethoven,Baudelaire, van Gogh – as well as, later, Kafka, Picasso, Virginia Woolf, JosephBeuys, and so on – as examples. Much like the shaman, the artist was a socialoutsider and trickster, generally masculine, given to volcanic fits of visionary(otherworldly and prophetic) inspiration.Mircea Eliade, the Romanian historian and philosopher of religion, firstpromoted the term “shamanism” to define a set of globally related legends andtechniques he identified in indigenous cultures around the world. Indigenouscultures tend to be moderate or small in size and lack a written language,passing knowledge down through oral traditions. Some modelled sustainability andcontinuity across myriad centuries; others despoiled their ecosystems andvanished long ago, leaving little trace. In 1951, Eliade published Shamanism:Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, which became the definitive text on the subject.Contemporary critics of Eliade’s cross-cultural synthesis argue that he was an“armchair anthropologist” who applied a biased model of cultural evolution tothe history of religions. His work subtly promoted monotheistic Christianity asan advance over primitive practices and beliefs. According to the anthropologistRobert J Wallis, in Shamans/ Neo-Shamans: Ecstasy, Alternative Archaeologies,and Contemporary Pagans (2003), Eliade spread the “misguided idea … of a primalIndo-European shamanism based on the ‘original’ Siberian model.” Eliade promoted“a singular shamanism as the oldest form of all religions, even the protoform ofmany established religions”, implying that prehistoric spiritual forms were“‘simple’ or less evolved than monotheism”. Wallis proposes, instead, thatshamanism “is not ‘primitive’ or an undeveloped residue of prehistory. Thecommanding impact of Eliade as a religious evolutionist has reified suchmisnomers.”Eliade identified cross-cultural practices and concepts across many indigenouscultures – from places as far-flung as West Africa, Nepal, Siberia, Alaska andthe Amazon. The similarities he found were, in many cases, astonishing. Thespiritual guides or psychopomps of these tribal groups – whether called shamanor N’gongo (among the Bwiti of Gabon) or Mamos (among the Kogi in the SierraNevada of Colombia) – would all undergo a difficult initiation that could lastmany years involving strict diets, long dark retreats and other privations. Thisinitiation gave them the capacity to commune with the unseen realms or thespiritual worlds. Sometimes, these initiations happened unwittingly, as a giftor dispensation from the spirits, through a difficult illness. By healinghimself or herself, the candidate developed the power, and in many cases theneed, to heal others.In his writing on shamanism, Eliade drew a sharp distinction between thepractice of shamanism and that of spirit possession, arguing that theserepresent separate, in some ways opposed, traditions. For shamanicpractitioners, Eliade asserted, the goal is to maintain one’s integral sense ofidentity while exploring the spirit realms, consciously working and negotiatingwith various spiritual entities on behalf of one’s client or community. Intraditions based on spirit possession (such as many African and voodootraditions), the initiate goes into a trance as a spirit enters into their body,using it as a vehicle for healing or prophecy.Wallis and others have argued that Eliade upheld a false separation betweenthese traditions and that, in fact, shamanism and spirit possession regularlyoccur together. In positing an evolutionary trajectory toward heroicindividualism and its apotheosis in Christianity, Eliade sought to distinguish“a ‘true’ or archaic shamanism” from spirit possession, which was seen as being“more corrupt, historically more recent, and subject to decline, degenerationand ‘decadence’.” By rejecting possession, Eliade subtly prioritized the modernideals of individualism and historical progress. Wallis notes:Eliade was either purposefully or subconsciously searching for what he perceivedto be the most fitting in “shamanism” to reflect aspects of Christianity.Eliade’s work has been the basis for the development of our current ideas aboutthe shaman – as well as the contemporary Western neo-shaman, who combinesaspects of indigenous spirituality with New Age and Eastern-tinged mysticism,often marketing their ritual skills to a privileged elite.In indigenous societies, becoming a shaman was (and still is) a difficult anddangerous undertaking. In dreams and trance, shamanic candidates frequentlyundergo visionary dismemberment. In these altered-state experiences, spiritswill devour them and then fill their bones with a glittering, magical substancethat gives them power – the power to heal, enchant, or kill. Many traditionalcultures also possess the notion that the shaman’s bodily secretions – inparticular, their phlegm – possesses a magical force or manna. The archetype ofdeath and rebirth – death to the normal world of everyday activities and rebirthinto the subtle dimensions of occult and astral forces – recurs again and againin these cultures.Shamanic images and motifs, what Carl Jung called archetypes in the collectiveunconscious, provide the basis for many recurring myths in European culture,such as that of the Fisher King, who suffered from a wound that would not heal,or the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, a shamanic figure able to cureillness with his touch, command the elements and transmute substances such aswater into wine. Shamanic concepts are also present in medieval Europeanalchemy. The alchemical maxim, “Die before you die”, tells the apprenticealchemist they must give up attachment to the normal world if they hope toaccess the myriad worlds beyond (or hidden within) this one. Visionaryexperiences – like those induced from drinking ayahuasca – are believed to allowone to experience the after-death state without physically dying. In fact,another common name for ayahuasca is “the rope of death”.Shamanism was the first – and in many cases, the only – specialized functionacross indigenous societies. In earlier civilizations and cultures, whereparanormal abilities or magic were recognized as an authentic force, the personwith the strongest psychic abilities would lead the community. The Egyptianpharaohs were not primarily bureaucrats or warlords (or reality TV stars) whobecame kings. They were the greatest initiates of their people, believed to begods. They ruled Egypt with the help of magicians who had highly developedpsychic and occult powers ascribed to them. The same was no doubt the case forthe god-kings of the classical Mayan and Aztec civilizations, whose magicianswere believed to influence the elemental forces.As societies grew bigger and became more complex, the function of the shaman orpsychopomp split into different specialized areas. Today, the various rolesoriginally belonging to the shaman are divided into the functions performed bythe artist, novelist, priest, scientist, doctor, psychologist and gardener. Andof course, over the past few centuries in the modern era, civilization becameincreasingly secular, rational and materialist. We lost belief in psychic,occult or magical influences, which scientists saw as nothing but superstitionsleft over from an atavistic past.In the Amazon, ayahuasca curanderismo developed into a set of tools, techniquesand practices. These practices and techniques vary depending on region andtribal group, but many consistent traits can be identified. A number of thesetechniques were identified by Eliade in his cross-cultural overview, yet theyare elaborated on in the Amazon basin. Ayahuasca curanderismo offers a largecomplex body of knowledge that connects the human being to the plant world andthe spiritual cosmos as a greater whole.Curanderos generally – but not always – undergo long apprenticeships. There areno degrees or certificates that give an official stamp of approval to shamanicability. As the anthropologist Michael Harner said, “You never graduate as ashaman. It just goes on and on. Your teachers almost never tell you you’reready.”Harner distinguished between two kinds of teachers: the first are ordinary humanteachers who themselves practice shamanism. Human teachers can help in manyways. They can share knowledge and expedite your training. But they can nevertell you when you are ready to practise shamanism. Only the second type ofteachers – spirit teachers, guides that the shamanic candidate works with in theother worlds – can show you that. In shamanism, mastery is a direct result ofinner experience. Harner noted: “The ultimate authorities are the spirits youwork with, and they tell you what to do and what you can’t do.”Harner thought it was a serious mistake to even call oneself a shaman:Because the power can be taken away at any time. Anyone who claims to be ashaman starts getting focused on his or her ego. He or she, however, is almostnothing, for one is only a shaman when the spirits want that person to be ashaman.Alliances with spiritsIsraeli cognitive psychologist Benny Shanon was intrigued by the recurrence ofspirits, animals and other archetypes in ayahuasca visions. In a 1997 studypublished by MAPS entitled “A cognitive-psychological study of ayahuasca”,Shanon explains his fascination with ayahuasca imagery. After attending apsychology conference in Brazil, Shanon tried ayahuasca, or Daime, with theSanto Daime church:When I returned to my own world after my initial trip and experiences … Iimmersed myself in reading whatever I could about ayahuasca. To my amazement, Idiscovered the images I had seen in my visions were of types similar to thosereported by indigenous persons. As a cognitive psychologist, I was puzzled. Howcould I, a person with a totally different personal background, saw what theIndians see?Shanon sees the visions induced by ayahuasca as “a manifestation of theuniversals of the human mind”. The universals, he writes, are commonlyunderstood by cognitive psychologists as the syntactic structures of naturallanguage, schemes of categorization or even the basic operations of logic andreasoning – things that provide a baseline for what it is to be a human. Butthese ayahuasca visions challenged Shanon – could it be, as he wrote, thatrather than super subliminal linguistic and cognitive patterns, “that serpentsand felines, precious stones and palaces are also universals of the human mind?Are there contents that are not culturally determined?”As part of his research, Shanon spent a number of years sitting in ceremonieswith dozens of ayahuasqueros of different lineages, from the Sibundoy Valley ofColombia to Peruvian mestizo curanderos, various Brazilian indigenous groups andsyncretic ayahuasca churches (UDV, Santo Daime and Barquinha). Immediately afterceremonies, he took notes describing the frequency of the images he’d seen. Healso interviewed many people – indigenous and nonindigenous, master ayahuascadrinkers and novices – about their experiences:For my ayahuasca visions, the most frequent categories – those encountered in atleast 17% of my ayahuasca sessions – were, in descending order: animals, beings(by this term I refer to creatures which are neither humans, nor animals, norcelestial ones), cities, palaces, birds, felines, serpents, artistic objects,celestial scenes, divine beings, landscapes, human beings, royalty and forests.The corresponding ranked list based on the interviews included all itemsreported by at least 47% of the members of the group. In descending order thislist runs as follows: beings, animals, palaces, human beings, serpents, ancientcivilizations, birds, angels and divine beings, felines, forests, cities,landscapes and flowers. The similarity between the two lists is, I find,striking.Luis Eduardo Luna was an anthropologist doing field work with Amazoniancommunities when he began to drink ayahuasca and undertake dietas – working with“master plants” in a disciplined way. Seeking to categorize the visions heexperienced over decades of drinking medicine, he wrote in an essay in AyahuascaReader:I have seen extraordinary palaces made of the bodies of beautiful young people,people making love, scenes of war from various times in history, militarypersonnel, prisons, places where I had the distinct feeling I should not be,catastrophes, tsunamis, asteroids colliding with the Earth, people in agonytrying to escape, and so on. I have been to places populated with human-likebeings that seemed to have normal, harmonious lives with their families,surrounded by gardens and possessing technologies I did not understand. Veryoften, I see people from the corner of my eye who disappear as soon as I lookdirectly at them, or become part of the general architecture. Once, I was on aspaceship where I saw three humanoids with insect-like heads hibernating invertical position, surrounded by a totally alien technology. In another session,I was on a spaceship above planet Earth, where anthropomorphic beings wereapparently monitoring our plane. I remember on a different occasion how I wasthoroughly scanned with a machine that could read my DNA before I was acceptedinto a space where creatures moved around hyperdimensionally through quantumtunnels, disappearing in one place and appearing again further ahead, followinga specific direction. … In that state I have the feeling there are an infinitenumber of worlds, some pleasant, some inhabited by malicious spirits. In some ofthem I may be welcomed. In others, the beings there seem totally indifferent tomy presence and continue to do whatever they are doing: “Just one more tourist,”they seem to think.These various visionary encounters with seemingly engaged, detached, vacuous,benevolent, haughty and occasionally furious entities become commonplace to someayahuasca drinkers. The turbulent – sometimes ecstatic, sometimes horrific –inner worlds one explores while on the medicine remain a deeply mysterious partof the experience.Ralph Metzner in The Ayahuasca Experience wrote:The two elements in the shamanic traditions that pose the most direct andradical challenge to the accepted Western worldview are the existence ofmultiple worlds or realms of consciousness, and the reality of spirit beings.As many thousands of explorers from North America and Europe use psychoactiveplants in ceremony “as a shamanic tool for serious consciousness exploration”they are compelled to shift their worldview, such that “the recognition ofmultiple worlds and the reality of spirit beings is becoming quite common”.Beyond visiting the fascinating turbulent realms of nonphysical entities thatpopulate ayahuasca visions, practising shamans often make alliances withparticular spirits for healing, receiving guidance, or other purposes. Shamanismis not a peaceful practice. Unlike yoga or meditation, shamans tend to seethemselves enmeshed in a kind of cosmic battle between invisible beings andforces that manifest in our physical dimension in a myriad of ways.In the shamanic cosmology, there are various types and classifications ofspirits. Metzner notes that there are spirits associated with “particularanimals (e.g serpent, jaguar), certain plants, trees or fungi, and othernonordinary entities (e.g extraterrestrials, elves)”. Shamanism is a syncreticpractice: these days, not only mestizo but even indigenous practitioners willincorporate Christian deities – not as some kind of ultimate divinity but asanother class of spiritual entity one may summon or utilize for particularpurposes. As Metzner writes, “nonordinary” states may include “the experiencesof actually becoming or identifying with that spirit (e.g, the experience ofbecoming a jaguar or a serpent)”. Healing and divination require the assistanceof spirits, often called “allies”, “power animals”, “guardians” or “helpers”. Inceremonies, one may also encounter negative entities – “bad or malevolentspirits that need to be exorcised or neutralized in some way.”Animal metamorphosisAmazonian ayahuasqueros will make alliances with spirits who come into theirbodies during the visionary trance and work through them. They can alsotransform, in their visionary journeys, into animals such as hawks and jaguars.The metamorphosis into an animal or otherworldly being – whether big cat,predatory bird, slithering snake, bug-eyed extraterrestrial or futuristicpraying mantis – is something that occurs during ceremonies. The experience canbe beautiful, exhilarating, terrifying – or all of those.Anthropologist Françoise Barbira Freedman, studied visionary plant traditionswith the Jakwash Lamista, an indigenous group in the Peruvian Amazon. In herextraordinary essay, “The Jaguar Who Could Not Say Her Prayers”, Freedman writesabout her apprenticeship with them. She was fascinated by the polarities betweencuranderismo and sorcery. She found the response to her enquiries to beambiguous:My questions as to how novices taking ayahuasca turn to sorcery or healing, andhow strong shamans ultimately transcend evil and good in an ambivalent power,all received a standard answer: “The plants themselves teach one one’s path.”Over repeat visits, Freedman found her Lamista guides were teaching her how to“keep right”. This involved disciplined adherence to a moral code as well asdeveloping physical endurance. Her indigenous hosts… made sure that I not only learned their culture correctly as an outsider butalso that I literally “grew up straight”. They viewed it as a slow process ofhardening myself in the manner of a tree from a weak, green, baby-like stem(yuyu likidu), to something strong and straight (sinchi puru).As she went deeper into her apprenticeship, Freeman found herself in a realm of“constant strife, struggle and rivalry … There was constant watching, rounding,feuding, deterring: a permanent state of alert against enemies galore, nearbyand far away”. She understood this as a residue of the region’s history oflong-simmering feuds, warfare between communities, and ancient enmities. Heranthropological training allowed her to see, intellectually, the connectionbetween the social dynamics of kin groups and shamanic practices relating to“soul capture, spirit allies, control of cosmic territories and game animals”.Yet, immersed in their world, she found herself trapped within the dangers andambiguities of shamanic practice.The boundaries between shamanism and sorcery, healing and attacking, became moreelusive for Freedman as she delved into Lamista culture and practices. Withshamanism, she realized there was no “neutral position”. This frightened her.Ayahuasca was teaching her… about polarities of power between good and bad shamans both in social powerfields and in my own psyche. Each moment became a precarious balance betweenacquired protections and defenses, attacks and retaliations.The culmination of her apprenticeship was an immersive visionary experience ofbecoming a jaguar – an inner experience that, for the Lamistas, marked athreshold in Freedman’s apprenticeship and the point at which she would have tomake a choice. Her vision began with seeing, sensing, and even smelling a jaguarwho came up to her. “We stare at each other at very close quarters and I feelits very strong breath in my face, reeking of rotten meat, nauseating.” Suddenlyshe was no longer herself witnessing the scene, but herself “becoming jaguar”:I feel it all at once, paws and claws, spine and tail, nose, whiskers and tail;I see with a jaguar’s eyes, suddenly encompassing a wider field of vision, pricka jaguar’s ears, open my jaws in practice. “My” jaguar has gone. It dawns on methat I have become her, am her, yet, at the same time, I retain the awareness ofher merged with my consciousness.She writes that: “Nothing I ever read about shamanic animal metamorphoses couldhave prepared me for the total involvement of my senses, body, mind in thisprocess.” One of the Lamista shamans appears to her as an eagle, communicatingwith her jaguar-self. She lies beneath enormous trees, “experiencing intensely‘being a jaguar’ in a way that inexplicably but unmistakably transcends alldifferentiation between good and evil”.In the wake of this powerful journey, Freeman’s shamanic guides prescribeddietas and fasts for her. They warned her that “a jaguar vision can be dangerousif it is not consolidated into defenses and the support of spiritallies”. Fromdirect experience, Freedman now understood how shamans… make alliances with the animal masters/owners/essences (dueños and madres) ofplants in altered states of consciousness, perceiving them as immanent. Byimpersonating predators such as the jaguar or the harpy eagle, they state theirdominant position in power relations within the cosmos.Such alliances give shamans knowledge which translates into an advantage inshamanic battles that take place across invisible dimensions of space and time,yet, what they believe or perhaps know directly influences what takes place inthe physical realm.Levels of masteryIndigenous cultures across the Amazon recognize different levels of vegetalistasor ayahuasqueros. These range from local herbalists and apprentices to maestros,and, rarely, great masters. Each tribal group that uses the medicine has its ownnomenclature. In their various languages, they differentiate between journeymen,sorcerers and maestros.The Shipibo, indigenous to the Ucayali province of Peru, use the term onanyawhich translates as “the one who knows”. Ayahuasca, for them, is primarily adiagnostic and healing tool. They see it as one of a vast array of so-calledmaster or teacher plants. In southern Colombia near the Putumayo riverbanks,those who serve the medicine are called payés or taitas, the latter being atitle of respect that means both healer and political leader of a community.Taita is a Quechua word used as a term of endearment by children for “father”,but is usually used to address male healers or leaders. Mestizo communities usethe Spanish term curandero, healer. The word ayahuasquero is often used forthose who travel to serve medicine – like the “Roadman” of the Native AmericanChurch who brings the “Peyote Way” to different communities over which heministers. With the explosion of ayahuasca tourism over the past few decades andcross-cultural commingling, the meaning of these titles has become increasinglyporous.In Shipibo, the oldest, most powerful and revered shamans were calledbancomerayas. Ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin was thinking of the bancomerayas whenhe famously wrote in Tales of a Shaman’s Apprentice: “Each time one of thesemedicine men (or women) dies, it is as if a library has gone up in flames.”A level below the bankomerayas are the old and accomplished teachers which theShipibo call merayas. As master healers and travellers between levels or planesof reality, merayas may transform into different animals and develop psychic oroccult powers, such as astral projection or even bilocation. For the Tukanopeople of northwest Amazonia, high-level ayahuasqueros are called curacas.During his years of dwelling with Colombian indigenous and mestizo communitiesas chronicled in Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man, Michael Taussiglearned that local people believe the true curacas – the great maestros – havedisappeared. A local woman wistfully recalled the curacas in conversation withhim:They could become tigers and parrots. They could fly. Now they are finished.They ate one another. They fought with each other. They would turn into a tigerto eat the whole family of their enemy.There seems to be a general belief that the great shamans, the bankomerayas, areno longer with us. This may be a result of industrial civilization, whichpenetrates ever-deeper into the rainforest, senselessly annihilating its localcultures and primeval mysteries as it substitutes an ideology of commercialismfor the animist cosmology and shamanic battles of the past.Across the rainforest, younger people from indigenous communities findthemselves forced to take work as oil extractors, miners, loggers or industrialfarmers. This makes it more difficult for the elders to pass on the spiritualtraditions as well as the stories and legacy of the community. Eventually, overtime, Amazonian languages and whole cultures disappear as quickly and wistfullyas morning mist.On the other hand, we find ourselves in the midst of a great ayahuascarenaissance. There may be more ayahuasca practitioners now than ever before inhistory. One positive side-effect of this is that members of traditionalcommunities now receive economic support and recognition for continuing theirshamanic practices – even if the monetary exchange has its own problems andambiguities. As the ayahuasca boom continues in this time of increasingecological threat and spiritual malaise, perhaps we will see the return of thebankomerayas – like the last Jedi from a Star Wars sequel – surfing the astralwaves of plant spirits and samsaric illusion, in the not-too distant future.DietasIn the lowland forest in the dense green foliage, the twining woody lianas, thedrooping nests of oropendolas, and palm leaves glimmering with morning dew,lives a shrubby tree speckled with elegant fuzzy blossoms. The demure pinkpetals of the bobinsana flower explode outwards like fireworks, in anarchitectural gesture that mirrors the medicine it is believed to containwithin. To the Shipibo-Konibo, the essence of this water-loving plant that rootsin unsteady grounds is medicine used to grow deep roots and expand outwards.Bobinsana (Calliandra angustiflora) is one of many plantas maestras – teacherplants. This shrub, native to Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil, isone of a vast pharmacopoeia of teacher plants of the lowland forests. Localpeople use a decoction made of the leaves, branches and flowers of the plant asa tonic and remedy for arthritis and poor blood circulation. Shipibo-Konibohealers might plant bobinsana plants around the maloka to energetically protectthe space from malevolent spirits lingering in the forests, or block chontas(darts or thorns) cast in their direction by rivals. Those who seek deeperknowledge and connection to the essence of bobinsana must undergo an initiatoryprocess called a dieta.A dieta typically involves drinking macerated potions made of extracts, whileabstaining from salt, sugar and sex while staying in relative isolation. A dietacan last a few days, a week, a month, six months or longer. It is an empiricalmethod of plant-investigation – a vital component of Amazonian curanderismo. –that opens a line of connection between a human supplicant and a plant spirit.Through undergoing such a dieta, one develops a deeper relationship with theplants – allowing the plant itself to inform the thoughts, the dreams and thecharacter of the dieter. Each plant has different capacities and teachings. Inthe case of bobinsana, for example, the purpose of the dieta is, often, tostrengthen, protect and “deeply root” the dieter.Other widely used teacher plants include chiric sanango (Brunfelsiagrandiflora), the ajo sacha (Mansoa alliacea) and the lupuna tree (Cavanillesiaumbellata). These plants have both physical and metaphysical applications. Theajo sacha, or forest garlic, is a fragrant purple-blossomed shrub known for itsmany physical effects as an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal andantitussive (cough suppressant). It is revered by some as an energetic “openerof doors” and an agent in dissipating the chattering mind and insecurities.Dieting with lupuna, a tree with a silvery bulbous trunk, is usually reservedfor seasoned experts. According to Stephan Beyer, the Shipibo say that “the treeis hollow and contains fish, and that the water inside communicates with theunderwater realms of the tsunki, the shamanically powerful dwellers in therivers and lakes”.Both vegetalismo and Amazonian curanderos believe plants to have metaphysical –and magical – properties. The supernatural character of these plant spirits inthe astral world directly relates to their medicinal effects in the physicalrealm. For some, fixating on ayahuasca without taking into account the dieta islike focusing on the Eucharist without considering the complex canon, history,symbols and stories that accompany the sacrament. The diet is the depth, thebackground, the integration and the context for ayahuasca.The combination of fasting and dieting with teacher plants serves differentpurposes, from practical to esoteric. Some might fast to rejuvenate the body orstave off illness, or as a preparation for hunting expeditions. An apprentice orinitiate of the spiritual path might be prescribed a teacher plant andinstructed to diet with that plant, typically for a full-moon cycle or longer.The dieter may observe a period of strict abstinence and isolation, abstainingfrom salts, spices, bloody food and fried foods in order to purify both theattention and energy of the person.“When you have a diet, you can’t fall in love, you can’t touch a woman, becauseyou’re getting to know the spirit,” Benki Piyãko once explained. “You can’t lie,you can’t anger another person – no. We can’t eat bloody food or food with lotsof energies. We eat everything light because we are birthing our spirits. That’swhy the diets happen in the forest. We go to learn, to heal, so we can learn bydoing.” Near the end of the diet, the plant is sometimes added into theayahuasca brew. It is believed that the spirit of the plant then shows its formand essence through the medicine’s visionary force.For vegetalistas, building a relationship with particular “master” or “teacher”plants through dieting and fasting is not seen as metaphoric – the plants cancommunicate directly with the dieter in dreams, visionary states and throughother means. By reducing stimuli and focusing on their senses, the dieterbecomes receptive to the subtle messages received from their plant teachers.Listening and receiving requires a calm atmosphere, free from distraction.During a dieta, the student observes periods of isolation, often remainingsolitary in a simple wooden structure called a tambo or maloka. According toBenki, undergoing a series of dietas is the prerequisite if you want to become acapable and responsible healer: “To become a master in these medicines, you haveto learn for at least ten years so you can be able to use and guide others inthe process, because it is study. It’s an elevated science of energies, muchhigher than the material world here. It requires commitment and attention.”When a shaman initiates you into a dieta, you make a kind of contract with thespirit of that plant teacher. You agree to maintain your discipline, and inreturn you gain knowledge and power. Failure to maintain the discipline –breaking or crossing the dieta – can have negative and even dangerousconsequences.Julia, an Illinois native, works as an integration counsellor in the Bay Areafor people exploring Amazonian plant medicine. She first heard of ayahuasca whenshe moved to San Francisco in 2010. She found herself immersed in theneo-shamanic subculture of the Bay Area, meditating, practising yoga, going tofestivals, collaborating with tech start-ups. She opened a Burning Man-inspiredstudio and event space and studied psychology at the California Institute ofIntegral Studies (CIIS), which is focused on “transpersonal” thinkers such asStanislav Grof, Barbara Marx Hubbard and Richard Tarnas. At CIIS, she learnedabout Amazonian shamanism. She decided she needed to try it.Soon after graduating, Julia visited a popular retreat centre in Iquitos.Although the healers were Shipibo women, she found the centre too structured andWesternized for her taste. She wanted a different – more “authenticallyindigenous” – experience. Eventually, through connections, she made her way to asmall Shipibo village in Peru where she found what she was seeking.Her shaman prescribed her a diet with a plant called ayahuma (Couroupitaguianensis), used by locals to treat cancer and skin infections. The tree isalso known as the cannonball tree for its large stinky fruits that crash ontothe ground from heights up to 55 metres. The alien amoeba-like flower yieldsactive principles isatin and indirubin, which are vital to its antimicrobialactivity. “When I first entered (the diet), I was not really open to the ideathat the spirit of the plant is coming and doing things, I was not thinking inthose terms at all,” she recalls.In her tambo, a retreat space in the wilderness, she found herself almostoverwhelmed by the power of the practice. “I was by myself in the woods. Therewere very strong physical effects; sweating, shaking and shivering.” Her dreamsbecame increasingly vivid. She recalls some of them being terrifying “and alsosome of the highs being very high as well”.Over the next six months, Julia drank ayahuasca about 75 times. “The impact ofthat, plus the ayahuma – left me feeling very spacey.” Toward the end of it, shefelt “not a lot of sense of personhood at all”.While she could handle the dissolution or quieting of her ego she experienced inthe jungle retreat, Julia found things to be different when she returned to herlife in California “I was hearing voices, I was hearing screaming, I was hearingthings talk to me in the middle of the night. I was having a lot of what seemedlike paranormal experience.” She contracted a persistent debilitating case ofpneumonia that continued for two months. She visited doctors, acupuncturists andherbalists, but no remedy worked.She consulted with her shamans. They told her she had unwittingly broken herstrict dieta. They said this was causing negative repercussions. Shipibo andvegetalismo practitioners believe that most “power plants” possess a light and adark side: when the plant-spirits feel betrayed, their shadow side comes out.They can vengefully attack the dieter on the physical and psychic level.“It turns out, and I learned later, that I had crossed my diet. I didn’tunderstand or have the intuition to know what to do or not to do. I didn’t takethe rules as seriously as I should have,” Julia recalls. Without realizing it,she had broken her contract with the ayahuma tree by having sex and eatingchocolate before the term of the agreement had ended. Because of this, shebelieves, she suffered intense attacks of illness and psychic or paranormaldisturbance.Julia’s experience reveals that those who follow the dietero path must bewilling to accept a strict discipline. “These plants are like spirits. They’relike people,” notes Debbie Rivett, the general manager at the Temple of the Wayof Light, a retreat centre in Peru. “Each of them possess a specific ability toteach or heal.” Each master plant has its own “personality, voice and power.”“To become a master, you have to be really responsible,” notes Benki. “In thesediets we have to be really responsible, or superior beings will call attentionto us.” The term “superior”, in this context, refers to spiritual entities thatexist and maintain themselves in other dimensions beyond this physicalspace–time. Intensive practices of devotion and discipline can build allianceswith these entities, while failure to fulfill our side of the bargain can leadto disaster.Menstruation taboosWhen European and North American women explore Amazonian shamanism, they can beshocked to discover that many ayahuasca-drinking cultures maintain strict taboosand prohibitions regarding menstruation. Women who are menstruating will oftenbe prohibited from sitting in ceremonies, or even coming near the shamans or themedicine. This is common to many, but not all, indigenous groups in the region.For urban mestizo curanderismo, these strictures tend to be much reduced. Womenmay be asked to wear a red belt during the ceremony, but will be allowed toparticipate normally.In her ethnography of the Airo-Pai in Peru, anthropologist Luisa Elvira Belaundeencountered prohibitions related to menstruation, food preparation and humancontact. She was told by community members that she must not walk around openlyor act “normally” while menstruating, or else the men will fall ill.Menstruating women in Airo-Pai communities stay isolated, sitting in a corner oftheir home, seated upon banana leaves. Husbands prepare food for them, leavingit on the ground so they can pick it up without making physical contact. If theydon’t do this, men, supposedly, fall ill with splitting headaches.The Secoya in Ecuador maintain strict taboos related to ayahuasca andmenstruation. A menstruating woman cannot sit in ceremony and cannot even benear the ceremonial centre or approach any of the shamans. In the Secoya’scosmology, the spirits they commune with in ceremony – the “heavenly people” –are skittish and sensitive to particular energies. These spirits will disappearif they’re chased, or if the drinker tries to hold onto them in their visions.Certain smells also repel them away.A yagé initiate (a keipi ukukë yagé) therefore must adhere to a number ofprohibitions, including abstaining from heavy and fragrant foods as well asalcohol. Women on their “moon” are instructed to avoid bathing in rivers,touching crops, preparing food for the community, and under no circumstances arethey to touch shamans. It is believed that not only will it scare away thespirits, but it can also hurt shamans sensitive to the powerful force unleashedwhen a woman bleeds.According to Jonathan Miller Weisberger, an ethnobotanist who works closely withthe Secoya, the Secoya must uphold the menstruation taboo because of the kindsof spiritual beings or energies that they commune with in ceremony. “There aredifferent kinds of energies – the earthly, and the celestial,” he notes. Whenthe Secoya sit in ceremony they evoke “celestial and immortal spirits”. Ifmenstruating women are present or nearby, these spirits “don’t come close”.The Secoya’s prohibitions around menstruation recognize the power of femalefertility as a chthonic force. In his book Rainforest Medicine (2013),documenting his experiences learning about Secoya culture, Miller Weisbergerrecounts one of the Secoya legends. The creator of the human race, Ñañë, openeda portal from the underground where many creatures and plants emerged. The lastcharacter to emerge from the underground was a menstruating woman. Thecreator-god turned her into a deer who scampered off into the forest before theunderworld portal closed. Several generations later, Ñañë left Earth, giving afinal sermon before his departure on how to attain celestial knowledge.“If you can listen to me speak until the dawn of day, you will be allowed torenew yourselves,” Ñañë said. But many of the listeners fell asleep except foran elderly woman, certain trees (Calycophyllum spruceanum), an iguana, a snakeand a spider, who heard the final words of Ñañë before his departure. Ñañëgranted these listeners the ability to renew themselves – the elderly woman withher menstrual periods, the trees with unfurling bark, the iguana, snakes andspiders with their capacity to shed their skins – making them “forever new”.Miller Weisberger admires the traditional Secoya’s strict asceticism, as it isreflected in their practices around menstruation, even though it upsets someWesterners, women in particular. As an initiate in their ways, he believes theSecoya elders possess an elevated metaphysical viewpoint. He sees them asspiritual masters who transcend the physical plane, becoming “spiritualimmortals” through their ayahuasca discipline.“The Secoya believe that they are able to live a fresh life, more similar tothat of the immortals where each moment is a new existence,” he says. “Peoplelet themselves get hung up on many things, but the Secoya don’t let themselvesget caught up.” By keeping their spirits clear, they avoid “compromising theirimmortality”. Spiritual immortality, he believes, is a small price to pay forrigour and caution around menstruation. Menstruation taboos may have emergedfrom practical considerations: hunters who diligently work to mask and removetheir smells through diets and floral baths ought to stay away from the smell ofhuman blood, a clear give-away in the forest.RenunciationThe voluntary isolation of shamans and seers is a widespread pattern acrossanimist cultures – and an archetype that recurs in modern religions also. AsDavid Abram writes in The Spell of the Sensuous (1997), traditional magiciansand shamans “rarely dwell at the heart of their village; rather, their dwellingsare commonly at the spatial periphery of the community or, more often, outbeyond the edges of the village”. The separation of the shaman, sage, and seerfrom the normal community reflects their need for privacy, but it also has adeeper meaning, “providing a spatial expression of his or her symbolic positionwith regard to the community”.The shaman or sorcerer is an edge-dweller, someone who dwells in the liminalspace between this world and the other, invisible ones that border upon it.Abrams notes that the magician mediates between “the human community and thelarger community of beings upon which the village depends for its nourishmentand sustenance”. These beings include the nonphysical essences and entitiesapproached in visionary states. The shaman’s physical position at the edge –between the unknown, the wilderness and the familiar community – reflects theshaman’s role as an intermediary between spirit and matter, heaven and earth,rational and ephemeral, seen and unseen, trick and trickster.The technique of fasting also functions as a means to bridge between thephysical and spiritual worlds. Food is believed to “dampen” the body, weighingus down, bringing us closer to the earth. To the Secoya, the celestial immortals– wiña pai – are thought to respond positively to the initiate abstaining fromearthly delights like rich foods and sexual encounters. Miller Weisbergerequates this to a kind of exchange or trade, whereby “something is given (tospirit) so that something can be received (by student)”. The shamanic candidatemust prove they are worthy of communing with the spirits by going througharduous, difficult, and sometimes dangerous, privations and initiations.The body can be thought of, as one Secoya yagé initiate phrased it, “like a toolor an instrument to channel the divine”. But the spirits can’t play the body ifit’s filled with gunk and frenetic energy caused by compulsions, attachments andtoxic substances. The initiate has to renounce material pleasures – to someextent or for some time – in order to receive knowledge from the spirits.Interestingly, some version of this idea seems to be almost universal. Buddhistmonks traditionally sequester themselves in monasteries. Many Christian saintswent through agonizing mortifications and renunciations. Physical tormentprepared their spirits to receive an influx of the divine.Renunciation – of food, alcohol, sex, companionship – isn’t easy. This kind ofinitiatory practice requires mental discipline and commitment. In today’s world,it goes against the grain of our consumer culture, which encourages us to haveeverything we want, whenever we feel like it. When the body becomes empty andlight, the mind quiets down. When intake of all sorts – food, media,relationships – is minimized, this allows the shamanic student to focus onsubtler levels or layers of perception. As one shamanic healer put it: “If youpay enough attention – if you develop your sensitivity – you can even getvisions from a cup of chamomile tea.”IkarosThe Shipibo believe that, onanyabo – those who work with oni (ayahuasca) –perceive energetic fields or patterns rippling around the body of their patientswhen they drink ayahuasca. Onanyabo learn how to see these patterns and workwith them as a result of the alliance with various plant spirits made throughtheir dietas. Some of the patterns are clean, orderly and harmonic. Others aredistorted and mangled. The dissonant patterns represent harmful or negativeenergies. Such patterns can be picked up from outside as the result of sorcery.They can also be generated internally as a result of psychological habits ortendencies. The Shipibo embroider these patterns (kené) and those of plants intotheir fabrics, which symbolically depict the vibratory signature of masterplants as well as other elements of their cosmovision. In ceremony, onanyabosing icaros, healing songs, which transform the dissonant vibratory patterns andbring them back into harmony. Through this complex synaesthesia, sound becomes aprecision instrument and technology for healing.The ayahuasca journey involves the overlapping and merging of the senses. Justas vision changes, turning brighter, stranger, more brilliant, sound alsotransforms. The humming of a motor in the distance, the cough of a shaman or thegentle crackling of a burning cigarette can become multidimensional, anorchestral tapestry of extraordinary sensations. The sensation of time alsodilates. Sounds can warp into colours, shapes and visions.During ceremony, even silence morphs into a sound that many describe as acontinuous buzzing, or like running water, or like the air that warps through acracked window in a speeding car. The shaman transforms the ceremonial spaceusing sound vibrations which, through precise intonation and evocation,transmute and realign energy. Sound can be targeted toward specific aims, suchas healing or the conjuring of particular classes of spirit allies.The idea that sound can transform energetic patterns surrounding the body andthus bring about healing is increasingly popular in our contemporary world.“Sound healing” and “sound meditations” have become trendy practices in urbancentres like London, New York and Los Angeles, as well as transformativefestivals around the world. Interest in this area intensified with the work ofthe controversial theorist Masaru Emoto, who makes the claim that even thevibration of our thoughts can transform the crystalline structure of water.Although his experiments have not been independently verified, Emoto writes inThe Hidden Messages in Water (2005) that “water exposed to positive expressions”forms harmonic crystalline structures, while water that is berated or denigratedby negative thoughts doesn’t form such crystalline patterns at all.While this idea might cause reductive materialists to scoff, there are manyindications that sound, harmonic vibration, health and physical matter areintimately interrelated at a level we are still discovering. Mystical andesoteric traditions around the world use mantras – incantatory sounds – as abasis for their practices.“Mantras consist of vibrations,” writes Joachim Ernst Berendt in The World IsSound: Nada Brahma (1991). “Our nerves, our ganglia, and our cells alsovibrate.” There is, Berendt proposes, a “law of resonance” which teaches us:“Anything that vibrates reacts to vibrations, even (as recent discoveries haveshown) to the most minute vibrations.”Berendt looks at the accumulated scientific evidence that reveals how differenttypes of music influence plant growth. He argues it is no different with humans:“Since the healthy human body is structured according to the laws of harmonics,the idea of healing human suffering and disease through music arose at an earlystage.” He notes the phenomenon of “Chladni figures” – how sand particles on ametallic surface will shape themselves into geometrical figures when a musicaltone is played over them. This reveals something essential about the order ofcreation.Beneath physical appearances, Berendt believes, the world is made of sound: “Thesound that gives order and beauty to the world is everywhere.” He writes:“Confronted with its power and might, the ‘particles’ of the universe, theplanets and stars, are only particles of dust that the sound ‘calls’ to orderand beauty.”This understanding of sound as the underlying reality becomes tangible, at timesalmost overwhelming, during an ayahuasca ceremony with a skilled practitioner.Their magical songs and chants, obtained through the shaman from the spirits(plants or other), make up a compendium of vibrations. These icaros (from theQuechua word ikaros) dramatically change across the ayahuasca diaspora, from themelodic sing-along hymns of UDV or Santo Daime, to the shrill whining andwhistles of Shipibo maestros, to the erratic, gutteral moans and whoops ofTukano communities. Icaros can be received through lineages, or obtained by theshaman through a direct transmission from ayahuasca or another teacher plant,usually received during a dieta but sometimes coming spontaneously in ceremony.As Wade Davis wrote of the Kofán in One River:The teachers are the yagé people, the elegant beings of the spirit realm, thedwelling place of the shaman grandfathers. Expressing themselves only in song,the yagé people give each and every Kofán an image, a song, and a vision thatbecome the inspiration for the designs painted on the skin. No Kofán shares thesame motif or the same song. There are as many sacred melodies as there arepeople, and with the death of a person, the song disappears.Don Delfín, one of the last remaining elders from the Secoya in Ecuador inEcuador, is one shaman possessing a unique icaros technique – although in hisparticular case, he sings nothing at all. The stone-faced Secoya elder issometimes referred to as “the master of silence”. When he serves yagé, theceremonial space remains soundless – a heavy ponderous void that can feel almostcrushing at first, for those under the effects of the medicine, where theemotional and visceral impact of every sound seems amplified at least a thousandtimes. Those who drink with him say his quiet presence transforms the thousandsof sounds of the forests, from the flapping leaves of palm trees to burrowingants to chirring cicadas, into a symphony, rich with meaning for those in thetrance – like a John Cage work or a living Zen koan.As the anthropologist Peter Gow learned, apprentice ayahuasca shamans may travelacross forests, making pilgrimages to distant places where they can learnparticular icaros, either through a transmission from another shaman, or from aparticular sacred stone, river or tree. Whether pracitioners obtain their icarosthrough physical transmission from another person or psychic reception or fromthe spirit world, the songs are important tools in the shaman’s kit – akin to asurgeon’s scalpel or a carpenter’s hammer. Through icaros, shamans focus theenergy of the medicine into a beam they can direct for healing purposes.DreamsThroughout shamanic cultures, dreams are understood to be portals that connectto the evanescent realms of spirits. Dreams can offer information about the past– or even the future. Shamans often retrieve useful messages from the oneiricand hypnagogic realms, translating them into waking reality.The ayahuasca trance, in itself, has dream-like qualities. The drinker enters astate of being where the common laws of physics, reason and order no longerhold. Under the effects of the medicine, drinkers viscerally experiencevisionary dimensions with their bodies and minds. They learn lessons, encounterold trauma, solve riddles, meet the unborn and undead, encounter mythicalcreatures. Sometimes they bring information back into ordinary reality.Oneiric exploration becomes especially important during dietas. When Westernersfast under the supervision of Shipibo-Konibo healers, for example, the shamansmay ask them about the content of dreams. As the dietero (the dieter) strips thegunk of heavy foods, leaky sexual energy and consumerist longing, they become ahollow vessel. When the individuality of the dietero fades into the backgroundafter long periods of renunciation, dreams of greater more universal importancemay be revealed.The Achuar, a rainforest community living between Ecuador and Peru possess ahighly developed dreaming culture. As Richard Russo wrote in DreamTime Magazine:“Dreams are central to the world view of the Achuar. Daily life is built upondream-sharing (wayusa).” The community wakes up several hours before dawn andgathers in small groups where they drink guayusa – also known as wayus – astimulant and purgative. Men, women and children take turns sharing theirdreams.Russo writes:If no interpretation for a given dream is agreed upon during the wayusa, theAchuar actively seek to understand the dream during the day, by conferring withpeople they interact with and carefully noting any unusual occurrences (whatJung might call “synchronicities”). In this way, dreaming and the understandingof dreams becomes an intersubjective activity woven into the life of thecommunity.The Achuar have been working closely with an American nonprofit, the PachamamaAlliance, which is seeking to safeguard their territory through the SacredHeadwaters Initiative, designed to preserve an area of the rainforest the sizeof Oregon state from exploitation. The Achuar consider this initiative to becrucially important. They have also told their collaborators that it is equallyimportant to “change the dream of the North”. This has led the PachamamaAlliance to offer a number of educational seminars on how people in the US andEurope can shift “from wasteful consumerism to a less destructive, moresustainable paradigm”.Sophia:In 2013, the boundary between dreams and reality dissolved one night while I wasdrinking yagé with the Secoya, during a tropical storm. Gently swaying in myhammock, I drifted off into a light sleep. A supernatural thunder struck theearth with a sound that nearly tore the sky open. In the aftershock of thatsound, I slowly slipped into the memory of a dream from my childhood. In thatdream, I was wandering around a department store as a little girl, barefoot,searching for my pink jelly sandals. Under the effects of ayahuasca, I recalledeverything precisely, from the chipped paint on the beige walls to myhumiliation and the cold echo of my footsteps in the stairwell.In my vision, I climbed into another room and entered a long-forgotten dream. Iwas in a green labyrinth, also as a young girl, holding the hand of a handsomeelven character (roughly fashioned as Link from the video game Zelda) as we ranfrom a horrible monster. Until sunrise I flicked from dream-memory todream-memory, cruising through my childhood dreams, recalibrating the visionsand filling in the blanks. Since then, the veil separating my dream and wakingworlds became more porous. At times, a sound, a touch or a gesture can transportme back to the numinous.The Amazonian shaman’s psychoactive toolkitAs Western explorers have learned over the past few decades, ayahuasca belongsto a botanical constellation – a vast jungle ecology of medicinal plants whichshamanic practicioners use for different purposes. The master or teacher plantsfall along a spectrum of psychoactivity and power. Some produce explosivehallucinations while others have much subtler effects and play supportive roles.Certain plants are used frequently in ceremonial contexts, while others arepreserved for the rarest of occasions.TobaccoFrom prehistoric times, indigenous communities across North and South Americaconsidered tobacco an essential plant for magical and ritual practices. The mostcommon form used in Amazonian ceremonial settings is mapacho (Nicotianarustica). Mapacho grows in rainforests and is a member of the Solanaceae(nightshade) family. Amazonian shamans use tobacco for spiritual protection,invocation and healing. When curanderos perform a limpia – a cleansing – on oneof their patients, they will often spray them with a sweet-smelling alcohol suchas Agua Florida, then blow tobacco smoke over them to cleanse their energyfield. Revered for its spiritual power to move and transform energy, tobacco isa master or teacher plant. Shamanic candidates will do intense dietas on it togain its wisdom and form an alliance with it.The mapacho plant grows up to nearly a metre, while the type of tobacco that iscommercially grown in the US and smoked in “cigarettes” is Nicotiana tabacum,which can reach up to 2 metres high. Nicotiana rustica contains far higheramounts of the potent alkaloid nicotine than the tabacum variety. Mapacho isgenerally treated with respect, inhaled sparingly and used mainly in ceremonialcontexts. It is well-known that nicotine is a highly addictive substance withserious negative health consequences for millions of people in the modernindustrialized world. People who regularly smoke commercial cigarettes reducetheir life expectancy by eight years on average. However, tobacco can be usedceremonially with less destructive effects.Iain Gately in Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant SeducedCivilization (2002), writes:Human lungs have a giant area of absorbent tissue, every inch of which isserviced by at least a thousand thread-like blood vessels which carry oxygen,poisons and inspiration from the heart to the brain. Their osmotic capacity isover fifty times that of the human palate or colon. Smoking is the quickest wayinto the blood stream short of a hypodermic needle.Tobacco can be inhaled, smeared onto the body, turned into a liquid and drunk orsnorted, and also used as an enema.Mapacho contains nicotine, nornicotine, anabasine, rutin as well as traceamounts of the beta-carboline alkaloids harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharminethat are found in B. caapi. These compounds are responsible for tobacco’scell-protecting, anti-inflammatory and stimulating properties. Because of itsMAO-inhibitors, tobacco ingested during ceremonies may enhance the effects ofthe brew. It’s common to see people smoking throughout the long yagé nights.Bundles of mapacho tightly wrapped in threads look like small bricks, which theshaman shaves off with a knife and rolls into their ceremonial cigarette. Theyroll it up and puff on it, blowing the protective smoke over their bodies andthose who have come for healing. This, it is believed, opens channels ofcommunication with the spirit world, where messages are shuttled back and forthvia the rising smoke. Tobacco smoke is also a vermifuge, useful for fending offinsects and other pests which deplete crops. It’s also rubbed onto open woundsor used to cure worms by suffocating larvae. The smoke is both a practical and aspiritual protector.In the Upper Amazon, Nicotiana rustica is also boiled down in a pot with wateruntil it concentrates into a thick sludge, mixed with a salty substanceextracted from a local palm – this is called ambil. Users rub a small dab of thetar onto their teeth, sit by the fire and share stories. It’s pure tobacco, andshould be used extremely sparingly.RapéRapé (pronounced ha-pay) is a finely powdered snuff made from the dried andpulverized leaves of mapacho. Generally, rapé mixtures contain residues fromother medicinal fragrant plants – as many as 60 plants, in some instances.Applied by blowing through a hollow bird-bone or reed tool, the snuff is used byindigenous communities of the Amazon for both stimulation, spiritual connectionand grounding. In traditional as well as neo-shamanic ceremonies and contexts,rapé is often used for centering participants, cleansing their aura. One commonbelief is that rapé helps to “clean the pineal gland”.It’s likely that indigenous people insufflated tobacco long before they begansmoking it. Archaeologists have found L-shaped tubes – similar to the ones usedfor rapé today – in ancient gravesites across South and Central America,indicating that tobacco snuffs were the traditional mode of administration.Rapé is yet another shamanic intoxicant that is increasingly commodified. Today,hippie travellers sell the grey or brown powder in small tubes, along withapplicators, at psychedelic trance festivals across Europe. Young cryptocurrencytraders and tech entrepreneurs casually blow the snuff up each other’s noses atluxurious gatherings in French châteaus, camps at Burning Man and nightclubs inLos Angeles. Among certain social sets, rapé has become a trendy social drug,used with no relationship to its ceremonial context. Anecdotally, rapé can helppeople break their smoking habits by providing another delivery mechanism fornicotine that isn’t as damaging to the lungs and heart. People sometimes userapé to displace their addictive desire to snort various consciousness-changingpowders that can have more destructive effects, such as cocaine.Some indigenous communities disapprove of the rampant commercialization of amedicine they deem sacred, meant to be used ceremonially. In June 2018 leadersof the Huni Kuin (Kashinawá) arrived at the offices of the Public Ministry ofthe State of Acre, Brazil, dressed in button-down shirts, iridescent beadedjewellery, their faces painted and donning their traditional feathered crowns.They made a statement denouncing the “indiscriminate use of rapé in cities”. Forthe Huni Kuin and others, rapé is considered a “medicine of power” whichfacilitates contact between the spiritual and the material worlds; for thisreason, it should be used in a strictly ritual context. “People are asking forprovidence against the banalization of this sacred medicine … which is beingmisused,” they explained, in a newspaper article published in Rio Branco, Acre.YopoThroughout the Amazon, different plants produce DMT in various quantities. Onetraditional method of consuming N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is by snuffingpowders made from the toasted Anadenanthera seeds. These seeds grow on eitherthe Anadenanthera colubrina or Anadenanthera peregrina tree, which have pink orwhite wispy blossoms. Known as vilca/ cebil or yopo/cohoba, respectively, thetrees grow across South America and in parts of the Caribbean. Blowing snuffremains a prevalent practice of the Yanomami and Piaroa of the Brazilian andVenezuelan Amazon.While we don’t know the provenance of the modern ayahuasca potion, we do knowthat use of these DMT-containing snuffs goes back for thousands of years.Archaeologists have discovered snuffing trays shaped like birds and fish ineastern Paraguay and southern Brazil, dating back to circa 3000 BC. Thearchaeologist Constantino Manuel Torres found evidence for the antiquity ofAnadenanthera seeds in smoking pipes from northwestern Argentina, dated to 2130BC. In fact, archaeological evidence points to the use of Anadenanthera snuffsin Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Haiti and PuertoRico.A legend from communities of the Orinoco river states that one day an unusualand beautiful bird appeared to a shaman with a message. In the bird’s beak weremysterious seeds. The bird said to the shaman: “If you want the same wisdom asthe god Yopo, if you want to know the past and what is to come, plant theseseeds and you will see.” They planted the seeds. Tall thorny trees grew fromthem with long pods. They ate the seeds, waited, but nothing happened.Discouraged, they tossed the seeds into the fire. The next day, one man sittingby the remains of the charred seeds took a deep breath, inhaling the powder.This is how they learned how to attain the wisdom.KamboIn 1986 the Nobel-nominated Italian chemist Vittorio Erspamer analysed thesecretions of a rainforest frog. He found it a “fantastic chemical cocktail withpotential medical applications, unequalled by any other amphibian”. Erspamerspoke of kambo (also known as sapo, Spanish for “toad”), the peptide-richsecretions of the giant monkey frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor) found in Bolivia,Brazil, Colombia, Peru, French Guiana, Suriname and Venezuela. The nocturnalflat-backed green frogs with cream-colored bellies spend their lives dwellinghigh in trees. An unlucky frog may find themselves in the clutches of a forestdweller who lays in wait and then grabs them off a tree. Once caught, theunwitting frog will be held hostage temporarily, its legs and feet tied.Terrified for its life, the wide-eyed amphibian exudes a waxy substance from itsback. The men will patiently scrape this potent poison off the frog andcrystallize it on a stick. The frog will be released into the wild and the venombrought back to the village to be used later by warriors. To take it, they burnlayers off their skin and then apply dots of the venom to the freshly burntareas.Within several seconds of the application, users feel tingling and numbness inthe area of application. They feel flushed, sometimes alternating between hotand cold flashes. The heart beat increases (one frequent practitioner says shereaches 180 beats per minute at its zenith), followed by dizziness, nausea,vomiting and diarrhoea. Within the next ten minutes the user’s face may swellup, sometimes resembling a frog. The kambo user must drink copious amounts ofwater, which they then purge out with bile during the ordeal.In a trend almost as surprising as the spread of ayahuasca, kambo has explodedin popularity in the shamanic subculture, now taken in metropolitan areas acrossthe world, enthusiastically praised for its purported antimicrobial, antibioticand immune-strengthening properties. Those who take “nature’s vaccine” can beidentified by small vertical dots, usually on their shoulders where the edge ofa smoldering stick burned into the flesh, and the crystalline secretion from thefrog was applied. The burn marks are a kind of badge of shamanic honour, provingone has met the frog.Little scientific research has been released on the venom, although its healingproperties have become legendary. Kambo contains dozens of peptides – two ormore amino acids linked in a chain – which bind to receptors in the human body.The chemicals cause a series of drastic reactions that effect gastrointestinalmuscles and pancreatic fluids. Kambo stimulates the pituitary and adrenalglands. Like ayahuasca, kambo is an “ordeal medicine”. It induces volatileresponses including sickness and vomiting, which may release toxins stored inthe liver and other organs. Kashinawá (Huni Kuin) healers use it for autoimmunedisorders, HIV, even cancers, and, anecdotally, it has a very positive effect onthose suffering from intractable Lyme disease.One popular belief is that if you take kambo several times during one lunarcycle, you will get a boost to your immune system that will last a long time,even years.Kambo is legal internationally. While the application of it generally seemsquite safe, there have been reports of people dying after taking it. Once again,there is barely any scientific or medical literature on kambo, so individualsmust make their own decisions about it. As an online resource, the InternationalAssociation of Kambo Practitioners lists kambo practitioners all over the world,from Dubai to Finland to Indonesia. However, as kambo becomes increasinglypopular, the global supply chain may put pressure on communities as well as thefrogs themselves. If the demand for kambo keeps rising, will it imperil thefuture of this wild tree frog?SanangaIn the rainforest grows another medicine, the white-petaled Tabernaemontanaundulata, also known as sananga. In the Brazilian Amazon, groups like theKashinawá (Huni Kuin) and Yawanawá people turn the roots and barks of sanangainto a medicine for ceremony. To prepare these drops, the roots from the bark ofthe plant are rasped, dried and strained through a mesh fabric and combined withwater. It’s then carefully dropped into the eyes, used to ritualistically purifythe vision and the mind. The liquid causes extreme stinging and pain immediatelyafter applying to the eyes. Cleansing emotional, physical and psychologicalstagnation, the eyedrops are said to “wash out” the old in order to make way forthe new.While there is little empirical research on the biophysical effects of sananga,preliminary studies suggest sananga remedies myopia, colour and depthperception, and other ocular ailments. The drops can be offered during ayahuascaceremonies in order to “increase spiritual insights”. Along with the plant’sreputation as a healing aid for vision, sananga is also applied for variouspurposes and is a popular dieta plant. It is believed to have contraceptive,anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Local communities use it tocounteract the effects of snakebites.ToéCommonly known as toé, the Brugmansia suaveolens or the pink angel’s trumpetplant is used in the world of Amazonian shamanism for initiation. Toé is meantto be used sparingly and only by those who are not tempted by sorcery. Among theShipibo, toé is called kanachiarni. There are seven distinct species ofBrugmansia plants. The bell-shaped pendulous plants give off a heady fragranceand, intriguingly, only grow where humans cultivate them as they’re extinct inthe wild. Brugmansia is one of the most powerful botanical deliriants producedby the natural world. The experience can be extremely dissociative. It isrecommended to only explore this plant with extreme caution, under thesupervision of a master shaman if at all.Brugmansia is a herbacious perennial plant of the Solanaceae family that growsabundantly in the southern hemisphere, from the foothills of the Himalayas tothe Amazonian rainforests. Toé produces alkaloids including hyoscyamine,atropine and scopolamine. This trio of alkaloids are also found in deadlynightshade (Atropa belladonna), a key ingredient of “flying ointment” thatwitches rubbed onto broomsticks, which they would mount and then “fly” on.In 1880 when the German chemist Albert Ladenburg isolated hyoscine, also knownas scopolamine, the medical community eagerly anticipated its use as apharmaceutical. The alkaloid, known to decrease the secretion of bodily fluidsand help to relieve nausea related to motion sickness, was heralded as awonder-drug to vanquish pain related to childbirth. The new drug, combined withmorphine, was vetted as a birth anaesthetic and analgesic which “abolished theprimal sentence of the scripture: in sorrow thou shall bring forth children”according to an article in McClure’s Magazine from 1914. Scopolamine had not yetgained the widespread reputation as “the devils breath”. Today its use inpregnancy is not recommended.In Colombia, scopolamine is derived from the borrachero tree – the “drunk” tree.The seeds are transformed into a white odourless powder – easily one of thescariest substances on Earth, rendering the inebriated completely incapable ofexercising their will, turning them into zombies for a day or so. In the citiesand the forest alike, criminals use it for nefarious purposes such ashypnotizing people into draining their bank accounts, or manipulating peopleinto sexual behaviour. Most have no memory of it afterwards.In the jungle, toé is used sparingly by rainforest communities as a plant forthe initiations of well-seasoned psychonauts. All parts of the plant are toxic –only a few velvety petals are tossed into water for the full effect. It doesn’ttake much for the drinker to experience paralysis of smooth muscles, dry mouth,diarrhoea, tachycardia, cycloplegia (paralysis of muscles in the eye) and in toomany cases, death.Speaking at the Women’s Visionary Conference in 2014, Annie Oak issued a publicwarning about the plant’s misuse for sexual gain:This substance has also traditionally been used in small quantities as anadmixture in ayahuasca brews and some people who call themselves shamans haveused higher quantities of this material to poison and abuse participants duringand after ayahuasca ceremonies. We have heard of several cases of women who haveexperienced this kind of violation and been assaulted over a sustained period oftime. This does not necessarily mean that they have been poisoned withayahuasca, which is a point that may well be lost in the media coverage of thisphenomenon. But rather people presenting themselves as shamans have used thiswell-established substance to sexually assault participants in ayahuascaceremonies and afterwards, especially the foreigners who are flooding intoIquitos and other centres of ayahuasca ceremonies. At higher dosages toé can befatal and indeed there have been accounts of poisonings in which those targetedhave died.The effects of toé can last for days. Some who unwittingly experiment with theplant find themselves in interminable, nightmarish realities. One commonexperience is a dissociative trance where one has the impression of meeting andtalking with people who seem entirely real, but actually don’t exist at all.Increasingly, ayahuasca shamans seeking to potentiate the brew will mix in toé.Allegedly, in 2014 in the Putumayo region of Colombia, two trustworthy shamansoffered a single dried leaf of the plant to a 19-year-old British backpacker tohelp potentiate the yagé. Shortly thereafter he died.Despite its dangers, toé can be used wisely. César Calvo wrote in The ThreeHalves of Ino Moxo that toé “makes you see the worlds of today and the worlds oftomorrow that form those of today”. The Secoya of Ecuador traditionally use toéfor initiatory ceremonies. The drinkers cocoon in their hammocks with thicktwine so they don’t move or hurt themselves during the trance. They remainimmobile for several days, undergoing intense dissociative visions that can bepowerful when integrated. The Secoya shaman Fernando Payaguaje wrote about toé,or pejí, in an essay in the multi-author work Ayahuasca Reader about hisinitiatory journeys: “You drink pejí to see the innermost depths of reality andalso to perfect your voice as a graduate so that you can sing clearly in theceremony.” He describes the process:The truth is that it’s scary to swallow that thick pejí … it has a veryunpleasant smell and a taste that’s even worse. Besides, you usually vomitinstantly, but you do it into a bowl so you can swallow it again. If you vomitthe pejí on the ground or on the floor, you won’t have visions. All you’ll seeis an immense land where you remain as if you were buried. It’s so pasty thatit’s not easy to swallow, so you have to push it down your throat with yourfingers. All of this is embarrassing, disgusting, and also frightening.If navigated properly, journeying with toé can reveal precious insights into theinner lives of plants and animals, according to the Secoya. “It is a very scarydiet,” explained Douglas, a musician and medicine man who has spent yearsapprenticing with Shipibo onanyabo. “But when you get to the end of it and whenyou make it through, the technology is incredible. When you’re good and solidand you have a foundation, you’re going to be able to handle all of the darknessthat comes at you.”LimpiaAnother crucial tool in the shaman’s arsenal is the practice of limpias, orcleansings. During a limpia, a shaman might call a participant over and work onthem, clearing their energetic field and performing shamanic healing. In sometraditions, the participant goes up to the shaman, in the centre of theceremonial room, and sits in front of them to receive their limpia. In someceremonies, the shaman will go from person to person, performing clearings thatinvolve blowing tobacco smoke over them, fanning them with bird wings,physically touching them, making incantatory sounds, and completing the processby spraying a perfumed alcohol over the body of the participant. Thesecleansings usually happen toward the end of the night, just before the firstlight of morning.A limpia can be a wonderful experience. Under the effects of ayahuasca, drinkerscan feel extraordinarily sensitive to smell, sound and touch. The ceremonialspace may also feel highly charged, as if there is an energy connecting all theparticipants with each other. The attention of the shaman during the limpia cancreate many strong internal sensations. Some participants will purge immediatelyafterward. It can feel as if the limpia concentrates the process of the ceremonyby bringing negative spiritual, psychological and physical toxins to the surfaceto be released. The feeling afterward can be of one of deep restfulness andpeace."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8MISUSEThese days, increasingly large numbers of Europeans and North Americans find thepsychedelic renaissance to be exciting, enthralling and hopeful. Across theworld, from Cleveland to Ubud, new fads in the psychedelic community follow oneupon the next: one year, it is smoking sapo – 5-MeO-DMT from the Bufo alvariustoad – to reach instant nirvana; the next, it is microdosing LSD and psilocybinto boost creativity and productivity. The mass media – which until recentlyscoffed at psychedelics as “toys of the hippie generation” and mind-destroyers –now reports breathlessly on every trend.And then there is ayahuasca. According to the media hype, ayahuasca is for ourtime what LSD was for the 1960s: A mind-opening, catalysing, transformativeagent that changes the world as it awakens and heals people. Magazines and TVshows portray ayahuasca as a miracle drug, a panacea for all types of physicaland psychological maladies. Hordes of new spiritual seekers are trying it,whether travelling to the Amazon or drinking it in lofts or yoga studios intheir native cities. They often imbibe with neo-shamans, who may have only a fewyears’ experience, or less, themselves.While the phenomenon is complex and invites anthropological critique, the netresult of the psychedelic renaissance is positive. The resurgence in psychedelicuse and scientific study is leading to new discoveries: it is truly changingmany people’s lives for the better. At the same time, the boosters of thisphenomenon often ignore or dismiss the darker, more ambiguous aspects ofpsychedelic use and shamanic practice.In exploring the malevolent aspects that exist together with ayahuascashamanism, our intention is not to stop people from exploring this medicine forthemselves. But we feel responsibility to make it clear that ayahuasca shamanismhas many aspects and there are darker layers to it.It shouldn’t be taken lightly. The rampant use and exploration of ayahuasca is anew phenomenon in our postmodern world. We are still learning about its effects.While it doesn’t happen frequently, psychedelics like LSD and mushrooms – andeven ayahuasca – can provoke psychological crises in certain individuals,causing mania or psychosis. While these substances often heal and provideinsight, they can also exacerbate underlying conditions. Even guided shamanicjourneys with experienced practitioners can become dark and disorienting. Thesetrips sometimes require considerable time and effort to integrate afterwards.The Amazon jungle encompasses violence and death as well as fecundity andbiodiversity. As an organic outgrowth of that ecosystem, ayahuasca shamanismreflects all of it. In the traditional context of the Amazon, shamanism –elemental magic, communicating with the spirit realm – shades subtly into occultinvocation and supernatural attack. These aspects are more intertwined than onemight think.According to Jeremy Narby, contemporary Europeans and North Americans have madethe mistake of idealizing shamanic practitioners as spiritual leaders and gurus,putting them up on a pedestal. While some shamans deserve our respect as greatteachers, scientists and humanitarians, many of them don’t fall easily into ourdualistic categories. Most of us have inherited, subconsciously, some form of adualistic Judeo-Christian worldview. Christianity defines spirituality as ablack-and-white divide between God and Satan, good and evil, heaven and hell,with nothing in-between. Because we get caught in this binary logic, we lack thediscernment required to fathom the depth dimensions of Amazonian shamanism,which encompasses light, dark, shadow, penumbra, ambiguity, phosphorescence,truth and illusion.“Amazonian shamans have never claimed to be either wise men or saints,” writesNarby. “Their job is to bring about transformations by enchanting theirclients.” This notion – that Amazonian shamanism heals and provides insight whenthe shaman enchants his or her client – is an important one to understand. Theone who enchants automatically holds a position of dominance over the client whois enchanted. Such a relationship inevitably involves a power dynamic.When we naively elevate shamans and see them as pure and benevolent, we repeatthe mistake that American and European seekers made a generation ago, when theyblindly followed orange-robed Hindu or Caucasian mystics who sometimes turnedout to be sociopaths or sex addicts. We should not impose simplistic ideas ofgood and evil onto a tradition expressing a completely different worldview thanour own.Shamanism is not essentially concerned with “enlightenment” in the Buddhistsense or “beatitude” in the Christian sense: shamanism is about knowledge – ofthe unseen worlds – and power, which can be used to heal, harm or transform.Plant medicines can, at times, induce the direct revelation of ancient mysticaltruths. But even in those cases, the ego can subsume that experience ofnonduality or unity consciousness, and appropriate it, eventually, as a tool forpower and control.We live at a time when our world is increasingly turbulent and our collectivefuture on Earth is uncertain. Because of this, many people yearn for spiritualknowledge and communion; they want it fast – immediately if possible – withoutundergoing careful or lengthy preparation. When they enter the shamanic realm,naive seekers from the Global North often struggle to make meaningfuldistinctions between experiences that elevate and transcend, and others that maybe psychic, glamorous – yet ambiguous and, in the end, even malevolent. That iswhy many spiritual teachers have counselled against psychedelics, seeing them asdangerous “short cuts” that may produce rapturous states but not enduringtraits.The visionary experience can be overwhelming and dangerous to the individual’sintegrity. In fact, there are many traps in the spiritual world. Cultures likethe Shipibo and Secoya know these traps and have cautioned against them. Ourculture hasn’t developed that level of sophistication yet.Traditionally, in the Amazon, shamanic practitioners do not seek nirvana orsamadhi, like Buddhist monks or yogic ascetics. Instead, they drink ayahuasca todevelop and hone their psychic and supernatural abilities. Ayahuasqueros areworkers in the spiritual, astral and imaginal realms. Under the effects of yagé,for example, warriors from the Kofan would shoot poison darts at their enemieson the astral plane, hoping to kill them. For them, warfare was a kind of bloodsport. They continued their attacks on the astral plane.PowerSerious shamanic practitioners and lineage holders all say it is much easier forapprentices to acquire supernatural powers by sourcing from dark energy, ratherthan following the path of the light. In his essay “At the end you see God”,Fernando Payaguaje recalled how, during his ayahuasca apprenticeship, he had toresist the seduction of sorcery. After one ceremony ended, he felt his heart was“hot, like a pot that’s just been burned. I felt the burning heat inside me.Even without working, I was sweating all day. Continuous visions assaulted me.”Through the medicine, Payaguaje realized he had the opportunity to attain powerfor sorcerous means: “I felt capable of doing witchcraft and killing others,” henoted. Suddenly he was able to tell witches apart from ordinary people: “Witchesdon’t look at people face to face, directly. They sort of crouch down. These arethe kinds of people who started too many fights in ancient times.”When she was undergoing her shamanic apprenticeship with the Lamista people ofPeru, the anthropologist Françoise Barbira Freedman was told: “There is achoice, and one has to resist the temptation to use the power to send darts ifone gets it.” Her teachers told her that apprentices who cut corners, breaching“prescriptive or proscriptive rules in their ascetic training, particularlyself-imposed ones, get weak and as a result become sorcerers”.Robert Rothstein, a well-respected neo-shaman based in Los Angeles, believes hewas attacked by psychic darts while travelling in Peru – they are invisible, yetquite palpable, according to Rothstein, when one is sensitive to their effects.The personable, grey-bearded medicine man laughs as he recalls how he met ahighly regarded local ayahuasquero at a bar in downtown Iquitos. Theayahuasquero asked Rothstein if he believed that women could serve the medicine.“I said, ‘Of course!’, and he put a dart in my neck. I looked at him, smiled,and pulled the dart out. I put it on the table. He got up and walked away. Inever talked to him again.”Douglas, an earnest ayahuasquero raised in Detroit who has trained extensivelywith elders of the Shipibo lineage, says that Amazonian brujería (witchcraft) isno longer limited to the jungle. Anecdotally, it seems that, as people work withayahuasca, their psychic field becomes stronger. Their paranormal abilitiesintensify. Sorcery and witchcraft can be unleashed unintentionally andunconsciously.“People aren’t even always aware they’re throwing darts,” Douglas notes. “Theydidn’t necessarily get the black magic training, but they throw darts anyway.”Of course, those who believe the reductive paradigm of the scientific worldview– which only accepts physical evidence and repeatable results – reject theexistence of extra-sensory perception (ESP), psi, telekinesis, synchronicity andso on. Some take pleasure in debunking any claims of psychic ability. Those whohave undergone shamanic training might argue, in response, that Westernculture’s predominant lack of belief in sorcery and the occult makes ourpopulation – like the Muggles in Harry Potter’s world – even more susceptible toits effects.The archetypal path of the shaman resembles, in some ways, the hero’s journeyoutlined by Joseph Campbell – akin to endless Hollywood films, or like thetraining of the Jedi from Star Wars or the rebels from The Matrix. The basis ofour Hollywood icon of the science-fiction hero is the shaman archetype, the“hero with a thousand faces”. In his book on shamanism, Mircea Eliade proposedthis archetype to be cross-cultural and almost universal.By developing discipline and moral rigour, through prolonged use and study ofayahuasca and other plant medicines, the shamanic candidate intensifies theirpsychic abilities. As in Star Wars, they learn they can use the “force” for goodor ill. Across the Amazon, the general belief is that it takes much longer andit is much more difficult to acquire power by following the pure and proper path– the path of light and healing. It is faster to take a shortcut, sourcing yourpower from darkness. Unfortunately, it can be extremely difficult for aninexperienced ayahuasca drinker to discern whether a particular shaman isworking with light or darkness.The modern neo-shaman charging $300 to $1,000 or more per ceremony may sell heror his services by promoting their years of apprenticeship to a Cofán or Shipibomaestro. Yet this doesn’t mean she or he didn’t eventually opt out to take thequicker, but shadier path. When it comes to shamanism, apparently, the Faustianbargain is a real thing. It gives the term caveat emptor – “buyer beware” – awhole new dimension.It is also true that an inexperienced drinker can receive benefit – healing andinsight – from a corrupt practitioner. Many dark shamans have power andfacility. The medicine, also, does its work independently. There may be noproblems – or problems may only manifest later, in subtler ways.Shamanic practitioners and students of the occult would say that much of whatsurrounds us, saturating our psyches, in postmodern civilization – media,advertising, bureaucracy – already possesses an occult or sorcerous dimension.The sleek glass facade of the giant corporate skyscraper tells us to surrenderand worship the perfected machine, Moloch, and ready ourselves for a flawlesscyborg future.Just as much as Amazonian animism, the Christianity that impelled thecolonialist project of European civilization is an occult belief system. Infact, many Amazonian ayahuasqueros see the archetypes of Christianity – Christ,Mary, angels like Michael and Gabriel, saints, even the bearded, judgementalBiblical God – as just one of a number of group of spirits or energies they cancall upon in ceremony for particular purposes. They use these entities as partof their shamanic toolkit.From a shamanic or traditional perspective, the rational West’s ideal of an“objective” science – free of all vestiges of superstition – is simply anothermyth, a naive projection of the world as we want it to be. In fact, thisone-dimensional ideology of rationalism blinds us to the subtle realms. Becausewe have no language for understanding the subtle dimensions, all kinds ofnegative supersensible entities may be able to invade and infest our world. Theshaman or occultist sees postmodern civilization, trapped by its reductiveideology of material progress, besieged by all sorts of interdimensionalentities. These psychic invaders sneak in through the gaps in our scientificknowledge, which denies the supersensible dimension and sees the occult asmeaningless fantasy.Interestingly, quantum physics has also rejected the antiquated notion of anobjective reality. The double-slit experiment, among others, reveals that theparticipation of a conscious agent is necessary for there to be any physicalworld – any illusion of materiality – at all. Quantum physics confirms the poetWilliam Blake’s belief: “The imagination is not a state: it is the humanexistence itself.” What we experience as the physical world is ultimately anillusion, an imaginal projection, just as the Buddhists say. Consciousness isthe projector and the material universe is the screen.Rational materialism, devoid of any concept of the soul or the supernatural,denies anything that cannot be verified through repeatable experiment. Shamansand occultists consider this ideology to be a kind of trance or spiritpossession. Most people only care about one state of consciousness – theordinary waking state – and they seek to accumulate material things. We havelost connection with any subtler levels of reality, the many dimensions anddream worlds that ayahuasca reveals. Amazonian cultures like the Achuar and theSecoya often believe that communing with these other levels or dimensions is anessential part of what we are here to do as humans. In losing touch with thedream world and the imaginal dimensions, modern humanity lost its soul and itspurpose.When people become aware of magic, sorcery, shamanism and the supernatural, theyrealize there might be cosmic forces and struggles taking place on levels farbeyond the physical plane. Rudolf Steiner was a brilliant visionary philosopherwho lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and applied his occultexplorations to areas like education (Waldorf or Steiner schools) and farming(biodynamics). Steiner said that a nonphysical or supersensible entity washiding behind the scientific materialist paradigm. He believed this being wasplotting to bring about its physical incarnation in the 21st century. Perhapsthis is what is happening in our time, through the accelerated combination ofartificial intelligence, robotics and genetic engineering. We are confrontedwith the threat that we will soon unleash a sentient, self-aware,super-intelligent artificial consciousness, devoid of human warmth or empathy.This entity or spirit may emerge on Earth in the next few decades – at a timewhen humanity, as a whole, has lost its true calling and connection to nature.Is it possible that ayahuasca represents a counter-strike against the threat ofthe technological singularity that looms over our future? A different kind ofintelligence is trying to communicate with us, coming from the heart of nature.Ayahuasca, as it twines around Earth, conveys a transformative vision, one ofpotential symbiosis with nature, offering the possibility of an entirelydifferent evolutionary trajectory. Could this be white or green magic battlingagainst alienated technology, diabolical egotism and sorcery – a struggleplaying across flickering planes of illusion and immanence, like some ancientmyth sprung to life?GreedIn 2015 Taita Querubin, an esteemed leader from the Cofán community of lowerColombia, issued a public statement denouncing the co-optation of ayahuascarituals by outsiders. The letter addressed Alberto Varela, the Argentinianfounder of Ayahuasca International and The European Ayahuasca School, who hasperformed ceremonies across the world. Taita Querubin denounced Varela’s claimsthat he had trained with the Cofán, stating that Varela was appropriating theCofán culture to gain credibility for his business. Querubin wrote:This person deserves to be investigated by the local authorities in each countrywhere he misrepresents and replaces our authority and the good name of theindigenous ancestral medicine for his own benefit and his lucrative businessinstead of serving the common good like we have done for millennia.Elders from the Cofán community are not the only ones concerned with the spreadof freelance neo-shamanism. The International Center of Ethnobotanical Educationand Research Services (ICEERS) offers in-person and online counselling forpeople experiencing trouble readjusting to their lives after ayahuascaceremonies. The Catalan psychologist Marc Aixalà was working with ICEERS wherehe treated a handful of people who were in crisis states after ceremonies heldby Ayahuasca International. They suffered from PTSD, anxiety, trauma and evensymptoms of psychosis. “A lot of people that come and ask for help, they are inneed of immediate solutions. Anxiety, insomnia, flashbacks – they cannot reallywait to understand all of the symbols and everything.”Unfortunately, ayahuasca can lend itself to being misused for manipulative andcult-like purposes. This is not the fault of the medicine, but a result of humangreed, lust and the desire for power. An ayahuasca ceremony where people drinkmedicine together often creates a powerful sense of group bonding. Inexperiencedusers may believe that the one leading the ceremony has a special ability toinduce the effect it creates. Certain psychological types can be persuaded togive their power over to someone they see as more spiritually advanced. We seethis reflected in the dark history of modern cults such as Heaven’s Gate,Jonestown and Charles Manson’s Family.Daniel:Some years ago, I was approached by a wealthy Wall Street trader who underwent apowerful spiritual conversion while drinking ayahuasca for the first time in thePeruvian Amazon. The trader had found his way to an ayahuasquero calling himselfMancoluto, claiming to be the “last great shaman” in the Amazon basin, the heirto the ancient Chavín culture of Peru. Based on his experience drinking withthis one person, the Wall Street trader was convinced this was the case. Isuggested the trader try some other traditions, but the trader wouldn’t hear ofit.The trader decided to use his considerable wealth to build Shimbre, a healingcentre dedicated to Mancoluto. Shimbre had a large concrete pyramid at thecentre of it – an homage to the Chavín culture and an ostentatious place forceremonies. The trader commissioned a documentary film to promote Mancoluto,Stepping into the Fire (2011). The film also followed the trader’s journey frommoney-hungry materialist to mystic acolyte of the world’s only remainingmaestro.As more foreigners went to work with Mancoluto at his new centre, they found hehad a peculiarly disconcerting method of dispensing the medicine. Where mostshamans spend the night in the ceremonial room or lodge, singing, praying andgenerally looking after their clients, Mancoluto doled out cups of super-potentbrew from the temple space atop his pyramid in broad daylight, and then sentdrinkers to individual tents, far away from each other, where they would liealone in the middle of the jungle. While he claimed he would remain intelepathic contact with his clients during the night, one woman who worked therereported going by his house during a ceremony to find Mancoluto watching horrormovies while his clients writhed and moaned in their distant solitary pens.When people drank his medicine, they often noted that the brew was not onlysuper-powerful but also induced vibrantly colourful hallucinations – far morecolourful than what they had found elsewhere. In all likelihood, there was areason for this. Mancoluto was adding admixture plants to his brew. Inparticular, one plant known to produce brightly coloured visions is Brugmansia,or toé – angel’s trumpet – which contains scopolamine and other tropanealkaloids that are highly poisonous. Brugmansia is favoured by sorcerers seekingto hex or bewitch the unwitting.In the summer of 2012, Kyle Nolan, an 18-year-old Californian, died whileworking with plant medicines at Shimbre. After he’d watched Stepping into theFire he was seduced by the allure of ayahuasca, hoping to find some answers inlife. Instead of immediately reporting Nolan’s death to the authorities,Mancoluto tried to hide what had happened by burying Nolan’s body and burninghis belongings. Eventually Mancoluto, whose real name is Jose Pineda Vargas, wasconvicted of homicide and sentenced to five years in prison. The Shimbreshamanic centre closed down. The cause of death was never determined. Whileayahuasca has been studied in depth and is known to be nontoxic,scopolamine-containing plants like Brugmansia can be lethal.The Shimbre tragedy is one of the most visible scandals around ayahuasca toemerge over the past few years. The rapid spread of ayahuasca is revealingdarker aspects to the medicine – or at least its flawed human practitioners. Anumber of reputable shamans have been saying that the energetic field theyperceive around ayahuasca is changing as more and more inexperienced people doit for many different reasons. Curanderos now have to push through many layersof visionary murkiness before they can access the medicine’s healing power.Lust“Amazonian ayahuasqueros are mainly men; not only do they tend to identify withpredators such as jaguars, but they have not sworn to the Hippocratic Oath,”writes Narby, who sees ayahuasqueros as “enchanters” who can gain power andcontrol over their clients. The enchantment engendered by the ayahuasca journeymay have particularly malevolent consequences when it comes to gender dynamicsand sexuality.“Western women who consult Amazonian ayahuasqueros may view them as therapists,”Narby notes. “But when a male ayahuasquero enchants his female client, therelationship between them changes; it is no longer based on consent, but onsubjugation.”Along with the spread of Amazonian shamanism, we find many stories andaccusations of sexual misconduct and abuse by male shamans, after ceremonies andeven during them. When she was 17 years old, Anna, a Swedish woman, had herfirst ceremony while visiting Germany. The ceremony was with a mestizo shamanfrom Peru. Just a few hours after the ceremony ended, when she was still clearlyunder the effects of the medicine and ungrounded, the shaman took her into adifferent room where he had sex with her. At the time, she didn’t resist –later, she said that she somehow felt she was supposed to allow it to happen.“What visitors like me didn’t realize is that shamans keep predatory creaturesas their guides,” explained another Canadian woman, Maya, who had beenunwittingly dosed with toé and seduced by a prolific shaman in Peru. “Spiritguides like the jaguar stalk and prey upon weak creatures – and that’s exactlywhat happened.”Unfortunately, enough cases like these have been brought to public attention andare common knowledge in the ayahuasca community. In response to theever-increasing number of revelations, Brazilian anthropologist and executivedirector of Chacruna.net Beatriz Labate and colleagues published an onlineseries – “Ayahuasca Community Guide” – on sexual-abuse prevention to educate thepublic and increase understanding about the cultural clashes that occur at theintersection of shamanism and sexuality.The guide states: “The globalization of ayahuasca presents complexcross-cultural interactions where local and global moral codes and genderrelational norms often come into contact and conflict.” It continues:“Shamans” are highly romanticized in the Western imagination. Some SouthAmerican, and indeed Western men, have learned to take advantage of these naivecharacterizations of the healer.The collaborative document offers a list of suggestions for theayahuascacurious, including “drink with friends”, “drink with experienced womenor couples”, “sexual intercourse with a healer does not give you special poweror energy” and “he’s a shaman, not a saint!”"},{"pageContent":"PART THREETHE VINE SPREADS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9MEDICINEAt The Assemblage NoMad, a luxurious members-only coworking space on 25th Streetand Park Avenue in New York City, Shipibo embroidery hangs on high white walls.Above the bar and across one wall of the lobby is a giant sculpture made out ofgreen moss surrounding sacred geometries. On the floor next to where people workand eat Ayurvedic meals sits a black geometrical pylon, a homage to the monoliththat appears at the beginning and end of history in Kubrick’s 2001: A SpaceOdyssey. Adding to the entheogenic glamour, sculpted mushrooms run up the walls.The Assemblage NoMad houses a sound meditation room, nine floors of privateoffices, a public work area, an extensive library of books related toconsciousness exploration, an elixir bar and lounge, and a roof deck where DJsspin electronic beats at alcohol-free sunset gatherings. “We assemble to seekout the best of what is to help ignite the collective imagination of what mightbe,” reads The Assemblage’s mission statement. The Assemblage was conceived in avision – an ayahuasca vision.The visionary founder and CEO of The Assemblage is Rodrigo Niño, a real-estatemagnate who once worked with Donald Trump selling condominiums in Trump SoHo.Niño was 41 years old and at the pinnacle of his success when he was diagnosedwith cancer in May 2011 – stage 3 melanoma had entered his lymphatic system. Ata Boston hospital “they removed the first lymph node from my left groin. Theytold me it had metastasized. The cancer was in other lymph nodes. Then theyremoved all of the other nodes from my left groin. This was a very invasivesurgery; I couldn’t walk for a month.” Married with kids, revelling in hissuccess in the material world, Niño had never been forced to seriously confrontdeath – the grim prospect of nonbeing.“In retrospect, I can tell you I was living a very isolated life within mysocial construct – within my limited understanding of things,” Niño recalls.Confronting a potentially imminent death sentence from cancer – “You wake upinside your worst nightmare. You wake up each morning and you think, I am goingto die. How do you start your day like that?” – he went on a search foralternative treatments. He found an article on ayahuasca in the March 2006 issueof National Geographic Adventure entitled “Hell and Back”. The author, KiraSalak, had gone down to the Peruvian Amazon seeking to alleviate depression – toher great surprise, ayahuasca cured her.Salak began her journey to the Amazon as a hardcore atheist. After a few weeks,her visions began to take on a distinctly religious caste:I cough violently and watch as demons burst out of me, roaring, only todisintegrate in white light. And before me this enormous image of God! He takesme in his arms and coddles me like a child. I know, unequivocally, that I amloved and have always been loved. That I matter and have always mattered. ThatI’m safe and – no matter what happens – will always be safe. I will never allowmyself to become separated from Him again.As her depression sloughs off, she sees a black snake on the ground, wrigglingaway, as if she emitted it in her purge. She doesn’t know if this is possible.Part of her wants to reject the visions. “Then I could have my old world back,in which I thought I knew what was real and unreal, true and untrue. Now – theproblem is – I don’t know anything anymore.”The article mentioned, in passing, that ayahuasca could sometimes cure diseases,even cancer: “The taking of ayahuasca has been associated with a long list ofdocumented cures: the disappearance of everything from metastasized colorectalcancer to cocaine addiction, even after just a ceremony or two. It’s thought tobe nonaddictive and safe to ingest.”It was this passage that caught Niño’s attention. Even though he was fromColombia, where indigenous groups still use plant medicines, he came from adifferent social class. Nobody in his world spoke about ayahuasca or took itseriously. They relegated it to the category of drugs – drugs were what a loser,dope addict, or hippie would take for escapism. As he read up on ayahuasca’salleged healing properties, he decided he needed to make a voyage to the Amazon.At the time, he was recuperating from his operation.“I was still attached to a catheter,” Niño recalls. “I was going against anydoctor’s recommendation. I jumped on a plane and went to Lima. I still rememberit like it was yesterday. I was very afraid.” A friend went ahead ofNiño on a scouting mission to find the right centre. He flew from Lima toIquitos. “I took a tuk-tuk deep in the jungle, to Anaconda Cosmica, a centre ledby the most famous curandero in the region. When I got there, I met the maestro.I sat down with the guy. I told him my intentions. Essentially, my intention was‘I don’t wanna die!’”The maestro responded, “I will see you tonight in the maloka.” There were 14people, all tourists, sitting in that first ceremony. Overcoming his fear, hefound his place in the room and drank the ayahuasca. Suddenly he found himselfback in the operating room, where he believed he was dying. He had to say hisgoodbyes to his family and the world that he knew. “That was my first ayahuascaexperience – facing that massive fear of dying. I found the only the cure tothat was, effectively, dying. So it was the confirmation of my worst fears –everything I didn’t want to find was right there.” The only answer, Niño found,was surrender. “Once I surrendered utterly to death in my journey – once Iaccepted I was never coming back – something else happened. I connected with aspark of light that I had within. Another way of saying it is that I suddenlyremembered I had a soul. I had a spirit. I realized: ‘I am not only mind andbody but also something else.’ That’s the first thing that happened to me. I cantell you very clearly that it connected me with the boy that I had forgotten Iever was.”Niño now credits ayahuasca with healing his body as well as awakening his spirit– after a regimen of ceremonies and dietas, the cancer went into remission andhas not returned. In retrospect, he says the cancer was the best thing that everhappened to him. The disease woke him up, made him conscious of mortality,forced him to seek something greater – “and ayahuasca is the second best thingthat ever happened to me.” Over the next few years, he went back many times towork with the maestro in the jungle. He began to explore other healingmodalities, as well as meditation and sound baths.Niño was lucky. Not everyone who dives into Amazonian plant medicine to healcancers and other severe and life-threatening illnesses survives, of course.During that same period and working with some of the same curanderos, LeonorCaraballo, the co-director of the film Icaros: A Vision (2016), was alsobattling late-stage cancer. She also dedicated herself to ayahuasca and otherdietas. Despite following a rigorous regimen with plant medicines, she passedaway.Anecdotally, there is increasing evidence that the methods used by curanderoshave efficacy for many conditions that Western medicine cannot cure. As of thiswriting, new clinics are opening in Peru, founded by Westerners, to test theclaims made by curanderos as well as the many reports from healed patients.Among these conditions are certain cancers and autoimmune disorders such asCrohn’s disease. Some Shipibo practitioners claim they can cure HIV – evenfull-blown AIDS – by following a particular sequence of diets. In the UnitedStates approximately 50 million people suffer from autoimmune conditions such asCrohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.At 42 years old, the Republican political consultant Mark Pischea suffered froma debilitating case of Crohn’s disease – an autoimmune condition which causesinflammation of the digestive tract. Symptoms include constant abdominal pain,diarrhoea, reduced appetite severe weight loss. There is no known cure. Alongwith approximately 780,000 other Americans, Pischea underwent a constant cycleof inflammation, surgery and recovery. Exhausted after decades of failedtreatments, Pischea was on the verge of giving up and committing suicide.He decided, before doing so, he would try a wild card: a visit to a retreatcentre in the Amazon to work with Shipibo medicine. As a 2015 article in theHuffington Post reported:Pischea spent most of the next three weeks in solitude, following a strict dietaof rice, plantains and specially prepared plant teas. Several times a day, hemet with a shaman named Antonio, who prescribed him local plants known to inducevomiting, as a way to cleanse the body and “reboot” the immune system. Theshaman’s recommendations also included ayahuasca, a potent hallucinogenic brew,and kambo, the venom of a rain forest tree frog.Four months after this treatment, Pischea was free of not only his Crohn’ssymptoms, but also depression due to his physical illness.The Canadian physician and addiction specialist Gabor Maté believes the rootcause of many illnesses is psycho-spiritual rather than physical. “I have longbeen aware of modern medicine’s limitations in handling chronic conditions ofmind and body,” he says in a 2015 article entitled “The profound power of anAmazonian plant – and the respect it demands”, on his website. “For all ourastonishing achievements, there are a host of ailments whose ravages wephysicians can at best alleviate. In our narrow pursuit of cure, we fail tocomprehend the essence of healing.” This is also what shamanic cultures believe– that illnesses are always a manifestation of a mental imbalance or spiritual“dis-ease”.Western doctors “see people’s illnesses as isolated, accidental and unfortunateevents rather than as the outcomes of lives lived in a psychological and socialcontext; as the body’s expressions of experiences, beliefs and lifelong patternsof relating to self and to the world.” For Maté, ayahuasca is not a drug “in theWestern sense of a compound that attacks pathogens, such as bacteria, orobliterates pathological tissue, such as malignancy. Nor is it a chemical thatone takes chronically to alter the biology of a diseased nervous system, as do,say, anti-depressants.” When taken in ceremony, the plant can connect people“with their repressed pain and trauma, the very factors that drive alldysfunctional behaviors.” These repressed energies manifest in the body throughdiseases and other physical symptoms.The healing properties of ayahuasca, for Maté, reveal the essential unity ofmind and body. An experiential transformation – the revelation induced by a truemystical experience – “can powerfully affect the hormonal apparatus, the nervousand immune systems, and all organs such as the brain, the gut, and the heart.”He believes that many physical illnesses have a psycho-spiritual cause – farmore than a physical one. For example, he has proposed that some women maydevelop breast cancer because they have been taught to suppress their naturalemotions, particularly anger. This hypothesis bridges the divide between Westernmedicine and the shamanic worldview, and makes sense of experiences like Niño’s,where ayahuasca seemed to bring about both a physical and psycho-spiritualchange of state.After his near-death experience with cancer, after dozens of rainforestceremonies with Shipibo masters, after deep personal reflections, revelationsand visions, Niño is not only a changed man, but a man on a mission: he seeks touse his financial acumen to bring about a transformation of society – for thebetterment of humanity as a whole. He has developed the viewpoint thatspirituality and self-enhancement work together:Each of us must identify our higher purpose as well as our archetype. What didyou come into this world to accomplish? What is your soul’s mission on Earth?Why are you here? When you tame your ego and place your mind in service to yourhighest purpose and archetype, this results in doing well for yourself – yourphysical being and egoic mind – while doing good for the world, satisfying thehighest expression of who you want to be. In other words, we discover thatwhatever our spirit, soul, or archetype wants to manifest can be implemented bythe egoic mind in this material reality. That is the equation.We find ourselves at an exciting threshold in ayahuasca research because manyempirical studies are currently exploring the visionary medicine’s healingabilities. Studies are looking at ayahuasca’s potential for treating addiction,depression, PTSD and eating disorders. Initial results are promising.As scientists seek to demonstrate the utility of psychedelics like ayahuasca forpsychological maladies, modern science and psychology enters new territory.There is no evidence that indigenous people in the Amazonian traditionally drankayahuasca to heal psychological complexes like depression, anxiety or PTSD. Inclose-knit indigenous societies where people cared for each other, they had amuch lower incidence of certain mental disturbances that are rampant in oursociety today. Those cultures don’t share the Western approach to mental healthand do not apply our diagnostic categories. What psychiatrists see aspsychological complexes, shamans might treat as the haunting presence of “badspirits”, sent by witches or dark forces. For those who believe that spirits canannoy, infest or possess someone, ayahuasca is indeed a great medicine.AddictionThe word “addiction” comes from the Latin addīcō, originally meaning to yield,devote, surrender or resign one’s self to something or someone. In contemporaryparlance, addiction is a disease where a person can’t stop themselves fromrepeating a particular behaviour or compulsively taking a substance. Somesubstances – like nicotine, alcohol or heroin – create chemical dependencies.With these drugs, breaking the habit generally requires an unpleasant or evenagonizing period of withdrawal. Other drugs – like marijuana or ketamine – canlead to psychological dependencies in some users. Scientists have studied themechanism by which chemically addictive substances hijack or take over thebrain, by displacing the dopamine reward circuit. In the United States, theincreasing prevalence of substances like heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine,along with new synthetic opioids like OxyContin and Suboxone, has caused asocietal crisis of drug addiction.In his work with inner-city drug addicts, Gabor Maté weaves together theapproaches of psychology, biomedicine and shamanic healing. In his book In theRealm of Hungry Ghosts (2009), Maté proposes that addiction, rather than ahighly personalized and individual issue onset by an external “addictive” thing,is a maladaptive response to suffering that should be approached from a holisticpoint of view. Today Maté works in partnership with ayahuasca shamans to healaddictions to substances that include alcohol, heroin, cocaine and evenmarijuana.In bringing the shamanic and Western medical traditions together, Maté isbreaking new ground. These traditions operate with a profoundly differentunderstanding of the nature of illness and the process of healing. While Westernpsychologists seek to alleviate mental complexes they connect to underlyingtrauma, shamans understand healing as a dynamic process that involves strugglingwith invisible forces in the spirit world.“The shamans I work with will see a spirit, a demon attached to someone and tryto remove it,” Maté says:It’s very hard work for them. They get exhausted, and in the morning we discusswhat they experienced. When the shamans do their work at night, they barely seepeople with their eyes. They see them energetically. They will pick up on thesame dynamics I do when I work with the group, except I have a psychologicalunderstanding whereas they’ll see spirits.Maté is less interested in the question of whether spirits and demons exist insome immaterial realm, than in what techniques can cure his patientseffectively. He has found the shamanic method can succeed where other techniquesdo not.While shamans and psychotherapists respond to the same set of complexes, theyapply different cognitive frameworks and therapeutic tools to help theirpatient. As well as serving visionary medicines, the shaman often usesperformative and ritualized techniques. From the psychoanalyst’s perspective,the shaman induces a type of transference to create identifications. Theparticipants in an ayahuasca ceremony may project their desire for healing ontothe shaman, who is seen as possessing magical abilities. Like the placebo effectin medicine, the effectiveness of the shaman may be partly based on the sickperson’s perception of him or her as a master who possesses hidden knowledge andpower.In traditional psychoanalysis, transference develops over an extended period oftime through therapy sessions. Over a series of visits, the patientsubconsciously identifies their psychologist with one of their parents as wellas other crucial figures in their lives (bosses, parents, lovers). They projecttheir complexes onto the therapist. With the therapist acting as a blank screen,they can work out their issues, learning to integrate them consciously, outsideof family dynamics or the ruinous consequences that result from negativeoutbursts in normal life.In the modern technique of psychedelic healing, therapists dispense medicineslike MDMA or psilocybin to patients in a clinical setting. As the patient entersthe visionary state, they tend to become detached and observant. In such astate, they have the opportunity to integrate their trauma or neurosis byunderstanding its source, without getting overwhelmed by fear or rage. In manycases, suppressed material will arise of its own accord, without any promptingfrom the therapist.Addiction in today’s society can be seen as spiritual disease. Many of today’saddicts are people who, if they lived in traditional societies, would havesought initiation into non-ordinary states of consciousness. In indigenouscultures around the world, a minority of the population feels the call to becomeshamans. These societies maintain traditional techniques of experiencing alteredstates, and assign value to them. Most indigenous cultures recognize theexploration of altered states as something innate, important and universal. Allaround the world, humans yearn to change their consciousness. They do thiscontinuously, through various licit and illicit substances as well as othermeans (meditation, amusement park rides, sex, the trance produced by socialmedia and so on).In industrialized societies, most people only have access to extreme alteredstates through destructive drugs like opiates – including highly addictivesynthetic opiates – alcohol, cocaine and methamphetamine. Ironically, theaddicts in our society may be people who felt the strongest call to change theirconsciousness. In other words, if they lived in a traditional or indigenouscommunity, they may have become healers or mystics. And in fact, quite a fewpeople who become devoted to visionary plant shamanism were formerly drugaddicts. In apprenticing to yagé, peyote or mushrooms, they can make atransition from seeking destructive highs to enjoying constructive ones.Addiction is not just a physical disease: it is a spiritual malady. As Matéproposes, we must address addiction as simultaneously “spiritual, physical andpsychological”. Contemporary Western culture tends to see these areas asseparate – and to dismiss the spiritual component of addiction altogether. Weare learning that these areas are not separate or contained. Western biomedicinemay remain incapable of finding viable solutions to addiction and othercomplexes without a change of paradigm. “As brilliant as we are, we’re missingthe point when it comes to these chronic conditions,” Maté says.To the question of whether or not the root cause of addiction or neurosis isactually a noncorporeal entity or a psychological pattern based on responses topast trauma, the answer could be that we need to get beyond such polarities.Perhaps both are happening at the same time. Some indigenous cultures seepsychological complexes that pass through generations of a family – what we calldepression or schizophrenia – as spirits that are connected to that lineage. Byhealing the complex in one individual member, you can positively impact theentire family line.Today, around the world, an estimated 240 million are alcoholics, 15 millioninject drugs, and more than a billion smoke tobacco. The drugs most frequentlyabused are the ones that trigger the dopamine circuit (with dopaminergiceffects), inducing floods of artificial pleasure. Psychoactive plants and fungilike ayahuasca, peyote and psilocybin do not affect the brain in this way.Instead, they have mechanisms that can alleviate addictive patterns – in somecases, entirely – thus transforming people’s lives for the better.A1996 study called “Assessment of Acute and Long-Term Effects of Hoasca Teas”revealed tremendous insights about the personality changes, addiction and thelasting impacts of ayahuasca. Lead by an international consortium of scientistsfrom Finland, Brazil and the United States the final paper was published byDennis McKenna, Charles Grob and J C Callaway. The study focused on 15 randomlyselected volunteers, all of whom were members of the Uñiao do Vegetal (UDV) inManaus, Brazil, for at least a decade, drinking the brew around twice every twoweeks (in UDV church services). A control group consisted of fifteen randomlyselected volunteers who had never tried hoasca and also lived in Manaus, fromsimilar socioeconomic backgrounds. Through various personality questionnaires,the researchers found that members of UDV were more disciplined, more reflectiveand less likely to seek out intoxication or evince behavioural problems than thecontrol group. UDV members also showed significantly more confidence, optimismand gregariousness. Perhaps most notably, 11 of the UDV participants werepreviously diagnosed with alcoholism, depressive disorders and drug addictions.According to the churchgoers, these conditions had gone away since theirinvolvement with UDV.Psychedelics like ayahuasca may create a level of psychological dependency eventhough these substances lack a physically addictive chemical component. Therecan be little doubt that some people regularly seek out the ritual, ceremony andthe glamour of the visionary experience. Alan Watts famously said aboutpsychedelics that once you have gotten the message, it is time to put down thereceiver. This is true for some people. However, in religious practices like theNative American Church and Santo Daime, the regular ingestion of visionaryplants – or sacraments – is intrinsic to the religion. As the study on Brazilianmembers of the UDV church confirmed, this doesn’t seem to have harmful effects –if any, quite the opposite.Since the hoasca study in Brazil, a number of preliminary studies havedemonstrated the efficacy of ayahuasca for treating addiction. To take oneexample, researchers from the University of Victoria and University of BritishColumbia studied the impacts of “ayahuasca-assisted group therapy” on 18 FirstNations people in Canada suffering from substance abuse. After ayahuasca, mostreported reduced levels of mental distress and depression, and decreasedaddictive behaviour. The study – “Ayahuasca-Assisted Therapy for Addiction” by GThomas et al, published in Current Drug Abuse Reviews in 2013 – found thatayahuasca-assisted therapy correlated with statistically significantimprovements in mindfulness, empowerment, hopefulness and quality oflife-outlook and quality of life-meaning.Depression and griefOver 350 million people around the world suffer major depression, with overone-third of cases defined as treatment-resistant. Informally, ayahuasca hasbeen pegged as a potential panacea for this growing endemic. In the UnitedStates, statistics from health-insurance companies indicate teenagers are moredepressed than ever. Sadly, these estimates exclude the millions of otherswithout a formal diagnosis or health insurance. In an interview for NBC, chiefof psychiatry at Texas Children’s Hospital Dr Laurel Williams offers a reason:“There’s a lack of community. There’s the amount of time that we spend in frontof screens and not in front of other people. If you don’t have a community toreach out to, then your hopelessness doesn’t have any place to go.”Preliminary reports from researchers in Brazil and Catalonia found that, afterayahuasca, six volunteers who had fallen prey to major depressive episodesshowed a significant decrease in symptoms and improved outlook for at leastthree weeks following the procedure. The volunteers, none of whom had ever takendrugs before, sat in reclining chairs in a dimly lit room of an inpatientpsychiatric unit and consumed 120–200ml of ayahuasca. The brew was prepared bythe Santo Daime church and stored in a refrigerator in the neurosciencesdepartment of Universidade de São Paolo, Brazil. As recounted in a paper by F deL Osório and other scholars published in Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria(2015), although half of the volunteers vomited, the patients found the purgingto be “an integral part of the effects produced” and “did not consider[vomiting] as causing discomfort.” (Flávia de L. Osório et al)NeurobiologyDr Jordi Riba at the Drug Research Centre of the Sant Pau Hospital in Barcelonahypothesizes that the DMT in ayahuasca potions temporarily binds to 5-HT brainreceptors, increasing the flow of serotonin, the neurotransmitter responsiblefor mood regulation. Riba has studied the effects of the brew for over 15 years.His research seeks to discover the mechanism through which ayahuasca healsdepression, not just psychologically but on a neurochemical and neurologicallevel. Working with the Beckley/Sant Pau Research Program, Riba discovered thatthe alkaloids found in ayahuasca cause neurogenesis, the creation of new braincells, in the hippocampus. The research was published in Scientific Reports 7(2017).When he applied the active alkaloids harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine inB. caapi to a petri dish containing stem cells isolated from the hippocampus ofrats, new cells proliferated. This research suggests that the molecularconstituents of ayahuasca may have great value in treating degenerativeconditions that impact the brain, such as Alzheimer’s and autism. The rate ofneurogenesis produced in the hippocampus is most active in mammals duringgestation. While there is evidence that neurogenesis continues in thehippocampus in humans well into adulthood, albeit not as intense as indevelopment, a substance that generates new brain cells at a rate comparable todevelopment can have a wide range of applications.We are in the midst of an explosion in scientific research and globalconsumption of cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, a nonpsychoactive extractfrom cannabis. CBD has many healing properties. It has become “an appealingoption for patients looking for relief from inflammation, pain, anxiety,psychosis, seizures, spasms, and other conditions without disconcerting feelingsof lethargy or dysphoria,” notes The Project CBD website. As with CBD, thechemical components of ayahuasca may inspire a future revolution in medicine.Ayahuasca is known to help “guide” many drinkers to discover deeply buried orrepressed memories stored in their subconscious. Accessing these forgottenmemories in ceremony, they reencounter grief and trauma in a transpersonal stateof awareness that allows them to confront the demons of the past and get beyondit. Sufferers can resolve their original trauma while in a non-ordinary state,allowing them to witness and integrate what they repressed from consciousness.A team of researchers from Portugal and Catalonia investigated ayahuasca’spotential for treating grief. They focused on resolving trauma and prolongedmelancholia following the death of a loved one. Doctor of pharmacology DéboraGonzález and colleagues administered ayahuasca to 30 patients who could notovercome their bereavement. According to the results published in OMEGA Journalof Death and Dying in 2017, a majority underwent a process of emotional releasethrough their work with ayahuasca. During ceremonies, many recalled memoriesfrom the past that had been lost or suppressed. A number reported that they feltable to heal or complete their relationships with the deceased by encounteringtheir spirits while under the effects of the visionary medicine.One 30-year-old female patient had lost her mother when she was four years old.Her mother jumped out of a window, killing herself in front of the woman and hertwo-year-old brother. The woman had no recollection of her mother and did notknow what had happened to her. In their family, the subject of her mother’sdeath was taboo. When she finally learned the truth, the woman’s grief turned toanxiety that tormented her.During her ayahuasca visions, the woman described going back in time to revisither mother’s death. Her mother begged her forgiveness for what had happened –“from a place of serenity, not tragedy” explained González. The ceremoniesconcluded with a vision where she scattered earth on her mother’s grave oncemore. In follow-up sessions with González and colleagues, she reported that shefelt reconciled with her mother. Her symptoms abated. She had made peace withher past.Post-traumatic stress disorderIn surprising numbers, US veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars sufferingpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) visit the Amazon to find relief fromsymptoms that can be debilitating. When the neurologist Dr Jessica Nielsonvisited a Peruvian retreat centre focused on ayahuasca, she found, that militaryveterans made up a significant proportion of visitors to the clinic. She alsomet former CIA agents and others with careers in military intelligence. Sherealized ayahuasca’s potential after “observing the other people that had prettysevere PTSD, and seeing their transformation over the course of the ten days …and seeing them soften up, and really open up, and seeing how ayahuasca helpedthem come to terms with what was going on with them.”PTSD can be difficult to diagnose and treat because it often occurs with otherpsychiatric issues (like depression, substance abuse, anxiety spectrumdisorders). Existing therapeutic techniques and drug treatments do not work onmany who suffer from the syndrome. Treatment-resistant forms of PTSD are common.Some estimates suggest up to 40–60 per cent of adults have traumaticexperiences, with 7–12 per cent of them developing PTSD.Some 94 per cent of victims of sexual assault are believed to suffer from PTSD,as well as a high percentage of combat soldiers.PTSD is a maladaptive response to a life-threatening situation. Victims ofpersistent PTSD suffer from hyper-arousal and elevated levels of cortisol, asteroid hormone. Fearing a repeat of the traumatic experience, their fight orflight response is easily triggered by any new form of stress, activating thebrain’s limbic system, which includes the hippocampus and the amygdala, whichhandles emotional responses.For those suffering from PTSD, a particular sound, smell or gesture may triggera memory that mobilizes their brain and nervous system in response to a threat.The prefrontal cortex manages higher cognitive abilities, such as our capacityto discern the difference between a legitimate or a phantom threat. The functionof the brain is to make split-second decisions, distinguishing a snake from agarden hose, for example. Those with PTSD often have diminished activity in thisregion. Their hyper-alert brain perceives nonthreatening actions (such as aclapping hand, a gesture) as mortal threats. Constant overarousal of thehippocampus can cause physical degradation to the brain’s neurological wiring,permanently degrading the traumatized person’s capacity to think and feel.Neuroscientists believe that ayahuasca works like a combination therapy.Ayahuasca’s anti-depressant qualities helps to reinstate prefrontal corticalcontrol, reducing fear-based responses, as also found in MDMA therapy. Ayahuascaseems to enhance brain function, restoring cognitive capacity and repairing thedamage caused by persistent PTSD. Dr Riba’s research demonstrates thatbeta-carbolines tetrahydroharmine and harmine actually generate the new growthof brain cells in the hippocampus. This may actually repair the damage caused bylong-term PTSD. At the same time, the visionary effect of ayahuasca allows thepatient to return to the source of their anxiety and witness it or reexperienceit emotionally. This helps to integrate the trauma.Through ayahuasca, PTSD sufferers revisit traumatic memories, understanding themin a new light – perhaps as initiatory and transformative. Soldiers may visitthe enemies they killed on the battlefield, asking for, and receiving,forgiveness. Often, people report being able to see themselves and their pastfrom an outside perspective that seems more objective and deeply empathic. Theyreturn to their life with a renewed sense of freedom and clarity.As a treatment tool for PTSD, ayahuasca holds great promise. Because DMT remainsa Schedule I drug in the US, progress has been slow. The legality limitsresearch into ayahuasca as a treatment for PTSD and other mental disorders. Thedifficulties of working with trauma survivors – who occasionally become unstableor even violent during their journeys – adds another hurdle. PTSD patientsrequire intensive support before and after treatment, which increases theexpense of carrying out studies. Hopefully, in the future, as ayahuasca andother psychedelics become less controversial, as more evidence on their benefitsis collected, it will become easier to conduct experiments.Eating disordersPreliminary research suggests that ayahuasca offers a powerful treatmentmodality for eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia, which can bedebilitating conditions. Those who drink ayahuasca often report, afterwards,feeling a renewed appreciation for the miracle of life – as well as their ownembodied, earthly lives. Sometimes they find themselves reconciled with theirown mortality. The morning after her first ceremony, a 60-year-old woman fromNew Jersey said, “I saw my tomb – it was glittering with rubies and jewels.Thousands of people cried and threw flowers over it. I realized I was in Egypt.I was sacred, and loved. I realized that I am a Queen – and my body isprecious.” Such visions can help sufferers of eating disorders accept theirbody’s imperfections and integrate their “dysmorphia” – the common delusion thattheir bodies are hideous.For an exploratory study, published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs as“Nourishing the Spirit: Exploratory Research on Ayahuasca Experiences along theContinuum of Recovery from Eating Disorders” (2017), professors from NYU,Laurentian University and other institutions conducted interviews with 16volunteers who had sought clinical help for eating disorders in the past andparticipated in ayahuasca ceremonies. The responses ranged from people who saidthat their eating disorder disappeared entirely as a result of ayahausca, tothose who found the symptoms alleviated to a greater or lesser extent. One ofthe male participants said, “There’s no more eating disorder … I came back fromayahuasca, I didn’t [binge] for six months. There’s no struggle around food. Thestruggle left.” A female nurse reported, “I don’t need [anti-depressants]anymore and I don’t have any anxiety anymore or depression and I would attribute[this] to ayahuasca … It just rewires your brain.”The psychological root of many eating disorders is a deep sense of shame,self-loathing and self-disgust. Through ayahuasca, people suffering from eatingdisorders may learn to appreciate their bodies again, overcoming self-hatred andfinding a yearning to return to health. The authors of the study noted,“Participants frequently reported shifts in self-perception that they felt werehealing, such as greater self-love, self-forgiveness, selfesteem, orself-compassion.”Many of the research subjects felt that they were better able to regulate andprocess their emotions following ayahuasca. One woman shared a vision: “I sawmyself as a rotting, decaying skeleton and then I saw myself as this beautifulfull-bodied, just beautiful woman with this long hair and I, like, I wanted tobe that woman. I wanted to be that full loving woman that has so much to offermy family and the world. It was, and then I felt my ribs and … they were sohollow and I was just, I was like, I can’t wait to get back and just startgaining some weight.”Clinical psychologist Dr Adèle Lafrance of Laurentian University joined thestudy with no knowledge of the healing potential of entheogenic plants. “We havemuch to learn from indigenous medicines,” Lafrance said afterward. “We need tolook at these substances in a very serious, scientific way to perhaps bring newtreatment options to those who don’t respond to conventional healingmodalities.”The authors of the study conclude, “That some individuals reported experiencingrelief – and, in some cases, full remission – from chronic ED symptoms afterparticipation in ayahuasca ceremonies is reason for optimism.” We may be only atthe very beginning of discovering the potential of the “great medicine” of theAmazon for treating mental and physical health."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10RELIGIONNew religions are often formed during periods of intense strife and persecution.The modern history of the ayahuasca diaspora begins with the birth of newayahuasca-based religions in the Brazilian Amazon. These religions formed duringthe rubber boom, a devastating episode in the multigenerational cycle ofcolonial exploitation. The rubber boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries– a traumatic episode for indigenous people in the Amazon – links directly tothe current fascination with ayahuasca, as well as its ongoing spread across theworld.The rubber tree is another plant that shaped modern civilization and, in a realsense, changed its collective consciousness. Perhaps as long ago as 3,000 years,the Mesoamerican civilizations of the Olmec and Aztec discovered rubber, usingit to make the balls for the ball games played in their central courts, theforerunner for European and American contests ranging from basketball to soccer.They also used it to make clothes and textiles waterproof. Europeans started tocatalogue uses of rubber from the South American Pará tree (Hevea brasiliensis)in the mid-18th century. Charles Goodyear invented vulcanization, a chemicalprocess that strengthens rubber and makes it durable, in 1839.In the late 19th century, industrialists found that rubber had useful propertiesfor a wide variety of industrial purposes in areas ranging from building tomanufacturing to transport. Across the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon, a massiverubber boom took place. This boom culminated in the early years of World War I,as Goodyear’s vulcanization process provided tires for The Ford Motor Company’scivilian cars as well as military vehicles. It ended when the Britishsuccessfully established massive rubber tree plantations in disparate regions ofthe world to ensure a reliable supply.Caoutchouc – called the “crying tree” – incited an epoch of slaughter theanthropologist Wade Davis described as the worst since the Spanish conquest.From approximately 1860 to 1920 profiteers orchestrated a project of unspeakabletorture and enslavement of rainforest communities. From the Putumayo river tothe Acre in Brazil, tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands were enslaved,murdered, tortured and uprooted from their land.Meanwhile, as Davis recounts in One River, colonialists made vast fortunes:Flaunting wealth became sport. Rubber barons lit cigars with $100 bank notes andslaked the thirst of their horses with silver buckets of chilled Frenchchampagne. Their wives, disdainful of the muddy waters of the Amazon, sentlinens to Portugal to be laundered … They ate food imported from Europe … [and]in the wake of opulent dinners, some costing as much as $100,000, men retired toany one of a dozen elegant bordellos.The Irish diplomat Roger Casement chronicled this brutal exploitation, writing:The number of Indians killed either by starvation – often purposely broughtabout by the destruction of crops over whole districts or inflicted as a form ofdeath penalty on individuals who failed to bring in their quota of rubber – orby deliberate murder by bullet, fire, beheading, or flogging to death, andaccompanied by a variety of atrocious tortures, during the course of these 12years in order to extort these 4,000 tons of rubber cannot have been less than30,000 and possibly came to many more. (Cited in Michael Taussig’s Shamanism,Colonialism, and the Wild Man.)This number leaves out disease, which obliterated some communities entirely.Survival International estimates up to 90 per cent of the indigenous populationwas wiped out during the rubber trade. Wealthy colonists shipped a few survivorsfrom the Witoto native population to England where they were displayed inmuseums as living curiosities. Some believe that the tiny handful of uncontactedcommunities remaining in the Amazon basin may not be “original” communities atall. Instead, they may descend from survivors of the rubber boom who fled to themost remote areas, far from transportation routes near the headwaters of rivers.The last of the milky sap dripped from the crying trees as the colonialistsmoved on. Industrialists cultivated vast plantations of Hevea trees in Malaysia,Sri Lanka and tropical Africa. Inventors also developed new technologies for thesynthetic production of rubber. Rubber barons left Brazil, their bank accountsfull, taking their champagne, cigars and horses leaving behind a trail ofwounded trees, rough-hewn settlements and bleeding people. A young Americanengineer Walter Hardenburg, horrified by what he observed, dubbed the forest,“The Devil’s Paradise”.As extraction operations moved overseas, dispossessed native communities andtraumatized mestizo workers tried to move on with their lives. In a landmarkstudy of healing and terror in the Putumayo region of Colombia, Shamanism,Colonialism and the Wild Man, anthropologist Michael Taussig traces the genesisof healing practices that helped local communities cope with the atrocities ofthose decades. Traders, tappers, border guards, settlers, indigenous andmixed-race people – descendants of those who were, according to a chronicler ofthat time, “bred like cattle” by rubber barons – made new homes for themselvesin the forest. In these towns and encampments they wove together new forms ofreligious faith that combined Catholic icons with spirits from the jungle.According to Taussig, yagé ceremonies became spiritual hospitals for thediseased and dispossessed. As the cultural landscape of the Amazon transformed,new symbols and sacraments pollinated traditional religious rituals. These newforms of syncretic faiths integrated the imprints left behind by Christianmissionaries and the influence of African spiritism like the Yoruba religion –worshipping entities known as orishas – that slaves brought with them fromNigeria, as well as ancient traditions of rainforest pantheism based oncommunion with psychoactive plants.Deceased missionaries and rubber barons from Portugal brought with themcrucifixes which ended up, ironically, on the altars of rainforest shamans.Taussig describes an altar of Santiago Mutumbajoy, an Ingano shaman south of thePutumayo river:A candle flickered across the roof beams and swinging hammocks. Grimy Catholicicons gazed into the wavering darkness and San Miguel, the patron saint of thenearby town and whom Santiago Mutumbajoy claims is the Indians’ saint who warnedthem of the coming of the Spanish … Copal incense filled the room and the nightsounds of the river and wind blended with the croaking of the forest to fill oursilence.According to Peter Gow in his article “River People: Shamanism and History inWestern Amazonia” (1994), “one of the most remarkable aspects of the ayahuascacuring session is the way it implicitly parodies the Catholic Mass”. Just aspriests bless wafer and wine, the body and blood of Christ, before giving it toparishioners, “the shaman blows tobacco smoke over each little cup of ayahuascabefore it is given to drinkers”. This may well be due to appropriation ofChristian symbols, Gow proposes. However, it is also possible that certaincross-cultural ceremonial practices – such as blessings and benedictions, use ofincense, smoke and icons – are actually universal, across cultures, in ritualsdesigned to evoke the sacred.Mestizo curanderos often put the sign of the cross over patients and wish themGod’s blessing before administering rapé, kambo, or ayahuasca. According toBrabec de Mori, the subliminal influence of Christian ritual in ceremonies is akind of Christian camouflage. Throughout the Amazon, Christianity inflected theanimistic forest traditions in ways that are not always easy to delineate. Atthe same time, some curanderos among the Shipibo make use of Christian spirits,which they see as particular energies or archetypes that have utility forcertain purposes. They draw upon the Christian pantheon of Mary, Christ, theHoly Spirit, the angels and saints just as they can invoke and call upon spiritsfrom tribal lineages or from African religions. In this sense, it may be thatcuranderos assimilate Christianity into Amazonian practices without changingthem in their essence.Missionaries believed in the dangerous power of sorcery and witchcraft, andassociated indigenous spiritual beliefs with Satanism. As agents of this evilideology, shamans were considered the enemies of Christianity. Missionaries mayhave feared, also, the danger of contamination. Stories, perhaps apocryphal,circulated of missionaries who drank the potions of the natives, and adoptedtheir ways.A legend goes that a missionary in the high slopes of the Andes notoriouslypersecuted local people for practising witchcraft. One day, a mysterious illnessovertook him, with no doctor in the vicinity. In a desperate attempt to save hislife, he visited the local “witch doctor”, who prescribed huachuma, amescaline-rich cactus. The missionary entered a deep visionary trance. Heentered a dazzling white light where he met Saint Peter at the gates of what hetook to be heaven. Since then, the cactus has been called San Pedro, and knownfor its protective qualities.As Taussig notes, priests and missionaries feared the power of Amazonian sorcery– and their superstitious terror only strengthened its hold on the commonpeople. When he visited the Colombian Amazon in the mid-1970s he discovered thatfear of witchcraft and the “evil eye” was prevalent everywhere. In every town hevisited, people believed that a powerful malevolent sorcerer lurked just a fewtowns away.Missionaries made strident efforts to stomp out indigenous traditions – smashingtools and implements, torching vines, chaining dancers, even killing orimprisoning traditional knowledge holders. This intense repression fromChristian colonialists forced the medicine traditions underground. Taussigcalled it a “momentous irony” that, as the Church made war on the indigenousspiritual culture, it actually strengthened its archetypal power, “therebyensuring the transmission of myth into reality and memory into the future”.Santo DaimeThe rubber trade in the Amazon rainforest unleashed destruction, chaos andtransformation. It enriched a lucky few and brought ruin to multitudes, whilecausing new migrations and cultural cross-pollinations. For Raimundo IrineuSerra de Ferrer, a descendant of African slaves born in 1890 near the Atlanticcoast of Brazil in São Vicente, the rubber boom inadvertently introduced him toa momentous destiny beyond anything he could have imagined.At 15, he travelled across Brazil to the jungle state of Acre. A lanky six footsix inches tall, Serra worked as a border guard and, later on, in rubberplantations, slashing trees and collecting the milky droplets of white sap. Likemany who migrated to the heart of the forest, whether seeking riches or justtrying to survive, Serra made contact with some of the indigenous people livingin the region. Serra and his native compatriots spent their evenings unwinding,sharing stories over cachaça, a distilled spirit made from fermented sugarcanejuice. Unlike most of the mestizo labourers with whom he worked, Serra grewclose to the indigenous locals and regularly drank ayahuasca with them.After he had participated in local ceremonies (where the ingestion of ayahuascawas often mixed with drinking alcohol, a combination that would seem quitesacrilegious to most drinkers today) for several years, Serra, originally raisedRoman Catholic, experienced the force of a direct revelation. During a ceremony,he started to channel his own kind of songs – the lyrics innocent and direct,the twangy melodies closer to the Christian hymns of his upbringing than theicaros sung by the native people. He felt these hymns to be a directtransmission from “the Queen of the Forest”, who he also believed to be theVirgin Mary. On that first evening, Serra channelled six songs, one of whichgoes:I climbed a mountain of thornsThere were sharp points I enduredBut the stars kept telling meThat everything can be curedThen the stars went on to sayDon’t talk, be someone who listensSo that I can understand and talk with my IndiansThe Indians are here right nowThey’ve brought their good medicinesOn bare feet with naked armsSo they can cure the ChristiansMaster Irineu’s transmissions incited the birth of a new faith that eventuallybecame the religious doctrine of the Santo Daime. As mentioned before,practitioners call ayahuasca Daime, which comes from the Portuguese verb “togive” (dar), featuring in expressions such as dai-me amor (give-me love) anddai-me fé (give-me faith). They will stubbornly argue that Daime is somethingentirely different from ayahuasca, even though it is made from the same plants.Today, there are Santo Daime churches in every inhabited continent on Earth,from the Santo Daime headquarters in Céu do Mapiá in the Brazilian Amazon, tochurches in California, New York, Oregon, Hawaii, across Europe and Japan. Thedoctrine transmitted through hymns to a poor rubber tapper and border guard hasbecome a global phenomenon.The Santo Daime took traditional Amazonian shamanism, with its animistworldview, and fused it with Catholicism. It also absorbed African spiritismtraditions like Umbanda, an Afro-Brazilian religion from Nigeria, as well asKardecism, into its doctrine and practices. Kardecism is a spiritist movementdeveloped in the 19th century by the French teacher Allan Kardec, exploring thenature, origin, and destiny of spirits, and their relation with the corporealworld, integrating theories on mesmerism and psychism. Kardecism helped Braziladapt “African traditions to the new lifestyle that was consolidating in thenation during the period of industrialization of the first decades of thetwentieth century,” writes anthropologist Sandra Goulart in the multiauthor workAyahuasca, Ritual and Religion in Brazil (2010). It became wildly popular inBrazil starting in the late 19th century, first circulating among the urbanelite and middle classes before spreading to rural communities.The emergence of new inclusive forms of ayahuasca ritual, given a familiarChristian overlay, brought together mixed races and classes. According toanthropologist Beatriz Labate, who documents ayahuasca religions in Brazil, “theearly communities of Daimistas can be seen as alternative social formations.”They provided an alternative “to the chaotic situation in cities overrun bylandless, unemployed rubber tappers; a kind of ‘halfway house’ between theseringais [rubber tapping concessions] and more generally for northeasternBrazilians displaced to the Amazon”. Small Daime communities coalesced aroundnew mythologies, rituals, customs and celebrations, devoted to the medicine’sability to heal, reveal and transform.Photographs of Serra, now known as Mestre Irineu, adorn the altars of thesegatherings alongside wooden crucifixes, flowers and water pitchers full ofDaime. Devotees (daimistas) dance for hours on end, singing hymns, often underbright fluorescent lights with plastic chairs militantly arranged around therooms. During formal ceremonies called “concentrations”, participants wear crispwhite uniforms, ladies on one side of the room with white dresses, glitteringplastic tiaras, and coloured ribbons called alehgrias (which translates as“happies”) draped over their shoulders. Gentlemen wear white suits with ties ofdifferent colours depending upon their lineage. As one American daimista put it,“we wear a white suit – like you might see in the Hamptons in the summertime”.Jonathan Goldman, an important figure in the spread of the Santo Daime in theUnited States, started holding ceremonies in Ashland, Oregon, in August 1993,three years later becoming an official church, named the Church of the HolyLight of the Queen (CHLQ). When asked about the role of Daime in the tradition,he explained “it is the teacher, the facilitator, healer, cleanser, opener,connector, veil-dropper”. Daime ceremonies – often called “works” – are designedaround concentric circles: “The center is a table in the shape of a six pointedstar. Coming out of that is a cross with two cross beams – the symbol of theDaime.” Rows of parishioners sit or stand around the central circle, withinitiates, those who have put in the work, often over many years, to developtheir esoteric spiritual capacities within the discipline of the church, closerto the centre. In Brazil, these ceremonies often take place under brightfluorescent lights where you are meant to keep your eyes open for most of theritual, except for those times when the Padrinhos and Madrinhas (godfathers andgodmothers) leading the ceremony call for silence and inward contemplation.Daime practice differs greatly from what one finds among indigenous groups, suchas the Tukano Indians of the upper Amazon, who swing in their hammocks drinkingheroic gourd-fulls of yagé, or Shipibo practitioners who use the medicine as adiagnostic tool to focus the healing power of master plants, as functional asdoctors in a modern hospital. Contemporary daimistas describe the effect as“collective shamanism”.There can be 50, 60 or even 100 or more participants in a single Daime ceremony,supporting each other to stay in “the current” of the medicine. Subjectively, inceremony, one feels meshed within a kind of psychic field, created by thegroup’s prayers and intentions. There are different kinds of ceremonies thathave their own sets of hymns that must be sung by the collective in the properorder. These songs seem to call in or intensify different energies or spiritualbeings. The songs can magnify the sense of psychic connection among the group,as well as inducing the feeling of direct communion with higher beings (angels,devas, divinities) who may appear in visions.Centro Espírita Beneficente União do VegetalIn 1959, approximately 30 years after the conception of the Santo Daime, JoséGabriel da Costa, a rubber tapper deep in the Amazon, drank hoasca for the firsttime. Apparently, he had been seeking the magic “tea of dreams” for quite awhile. As a 1968 article from O Estado De S. Paulo, a daily newspaper in SãoPaulo, notes:Gabriel came to Rondônia in 1941, when rubber extraction received a boost due tothe demands of the war. Always with an idea fixed on the tea of dreams – “whichmade us see persons who were not there” – Gabriel went to the rubber camp. Heearned nine cruzeiros (the old kind) per kilo of rubber extracted and lived inthe worst possible conditions.When da Costa drank hoasca for the first time: “I felt myself outside the earth.The forest became covered in gold. I heard music that I’d never heard before. Isaw so many marvellous things that the vocabulary that I have does not evenoffer the words for me to describe them.” Today, the UDV has 17,000 membersspread around the world. It is similar to Santo Daime in some respects.Parishioners wear uniforms and formal services are held on a regular schedule.Like Mestre Irineu before him, da Costa felt inspired by direct revelation tostart a new religion with its own doctrine. He founded what eventually becamethe Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal in 1961, at a rubber camp onthe border between Brazil and Bolivia. For UDV faithful, the creation of thechurch was actually its “re-creation”, as they believe, according to theirdoctrine, that Mestre Gabriel “was only remembering his previous incarnationsand reactualizing his sacred ‘mission’; specifically by restoring the União doVegetal on Earth, re-creating it,” in the words of Sandra Goulart in Ayahuasca,Ritual and Religion in Brazil.According to Goulart, the practices of the UDV derived from Catholic ritualspopular in rural communities in Brazil, such as the bendito (blessing), prayersthat are sung in praise of particular saints. One basis of the UDV ceremony ischamadas, songs that have been channelled through a mestre, but considered to be“brought” into the world by a spiritual being. “The UDV is always represented asa religion or doctrine of Christian principles in its documents, registers, andpublic positioning,” Goulart writes. In UDV doctrine, Mestre Gabriel isassociated with Jesus: “In the same way that Christ chose humble fishermen to behis apostles, Mestre Gabriel chose disciples from among caboclos” – the oftenpoor and excluded mixed-race riverine populations.King Solomon, from the Old Testament, also plays a central role in the esoterichistory of the UDV. According to one of their formation myths, a man namedCaiano was the first to drink hoasca, also called vegetal in their tradition.Caiano lived at the time of King Solomon and served him. Mestre Gabriel isconsidered the reincarnation of Caiano, the first drinker of the tea. It isusual for members of the UDV to have visionary experiences of their past lives,often connected with the origin of the church at the time of King Solomon.The second ReformationThe phenomenon of modern religions – including Santo Daime, UDV and NativeAmerican Church – based on communion with visionary plant sacraments may haveprofound consequences for the future of religion. In The Psychedelic Future ofthe Mind (2013), Thomas Roberts, professor of educational psychology at NorthernIllinois University, puts forth a wide-ranging theoretical framework forunderstanding the contemporary rediscovery of the entheogenic experience inrelationship to the history of religious faith, and the impact this may have onthe evolution of religion into the future. During the first Reformation, 500years ago, the Bible was translated into the common languages. Ordinary peoplewere finally able to read the “word of God” for themselves, without needing themediation of priests.During the Reformation, Christianity fragmented into different denominations,emphasizing different aspects of the faith. Roberts believes, with therediscovery of entheogens and their capacity to produce direct and unmediatedmystical experience, we find ourselves in a second Reformation. We aretransitioning from “an era of word-based religion to an era of experience-basedreligion,” Roberts notes, and this transition may turn out to be at least assignificant as the original Reformation.Roberts goes further in his theory, to postulate a future for experimentalresearch into the unknown capabilities inherent in different state ofconsciousness, or what he prefers to call “mind–body” states. As part of thisresearch effort, “cognitive designers” will develop “psychotechnologies”,methods of producing unknown and entirely novel mind– body states. In thesemind–body states, we can access different cognitive processes. Roberts’terminology gives expression to something that happens routinely duringentheogenic experiences, including ayahuasca journeys. In these states, oneaccesses unusual mental, psychological and even psychic capacities.The future of religion could include new devotional practices that integratedirect access to visionary states with an applied science of consciousness. Thescientists/monks/alchemists of the future might use substances like ayahuascaand peyote as instruments to map out various mind–body states. Exploring thosestates, they will learn how to access particular dimensions of consciousness aswell as subtle capacities like intuition, inspiration and imagination. They willapply the knowledge gleaned from this experimental science of consciousness toour world.Roberts expects that, just as programmers code new applications for computersand smart phones, cognitive designers will be able to compose “new programs” forthe human mind, “designing and creating new cognitive processes”. This researchcan apply everything science is discovering about brainwaves (theta, alpha,etc), neurobiology, quantum microtubules inside brain neurons, music and soundfrequency, the synaptic wiring of the brain, and so on, to invent “the future ofthe human mind”. As part of this work we will also seek to map out the stilllargely unknown territory of various mind–body or consciousness states, alongwith “their respective abilities and biological correlates”.It may be that entirely different abilities – physical abilities as well aspsychological and even psychic ones – become available to us in differentmind–body states. Anecdotally, this seems to be the case. If we were toestablish the phenomenological exploration and study of the variety of mind–bodystates as a legitimate terrain for future investigation, we could developsomething like a science of initiatory practices and mystical-state experiences.While it seems radical now, this may be part of a natural development fromtext-based to experience-based religions integrated into our postmodern,scientific and technological world. The ayahuasca religions from Brazil connectanimist tribal traditions to a more modernized form of collective shamanism.This may presage yet another step, as science and spirituality merge in a newcreative synthesis.Many people discover that symbols and archetypes from the world’s religious andmythological traditions become palpably real, viscerally available to themduring their ayahuasca journeys. This happened with Mestre Irineu and MestreGabriel, leading them to found new religions based not on received wisdom butdirect revelation. They integrated their Christian faith with its particularspiritual lineage into the transmissions they received through the botanicalgnosis of ayahuasca.As ayahuasca travels around the world, spiritual seekers from diverse ethnic andreligious backgrounds are, similarly, finding that the revelations they receivefrom the medicine relate to their cultural or perhaps even genetic (orepigenetic) heritage. Hindus, Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and othersall report distinct religious epiphanies under the influence of ayahuasca. Whenthey see visions, the transmissions are often filtered through their particulartraditions. This is the case even when they come to the medicine from ascientific, secular and materialist perspective. Catalysing the availablecontents in the individual’s unconscious, ayahuasca often communicates toseekers in the language that speaks to them most profoundly. This can give thevisions induced by its neurochemical effects the force of divine prophecy.One popular sideline in psychedelic research is the perhaps ultimatelyunanswerable (but fascinating) question of how psychedelic plants were used inancient history, and the influence they had on religion and culture. Didentheogens inform or inspire the origin of religion, based in mysticalrevelation? Even going a step further, is it possible that a psychedeliccatalysed the evolutionary leap in the organization of the brain thataccompanied the development of language?The psychedelic thinker Terence McKenna developed the “stoned ape” theory,positing that our distant ancestors started experimenting with psilocybin (orsome other psychedelic substance, maybe iboga, which grows in Equatorial Africa,humanity’s birthplace) perhaps copying the animals that seek out psychoactivecompounds. The immediate predecessors of Homo sapiens may have found that eatingthis substance gave them an evolutionary advantage. It enhanced their sensorycapacities (in Gabon and Cameroon, aboriginal people still eat small amounts ofiboga when they go hunting) and catalysed new cognitive processes such aslanguage. Based on his direct experiences with mushrooms, which communicated tohim directly during a formative experience in the Amazon, McKenna speculatedthat psilocybin may have been responsible for originating language-processing inthe brain. The origin of human consciousness as well as the mystical experiencemay have been linked to humanity’s use of visionary plants.In the Rig Veda, one of the earliest collections of Vedic Sanskrit hymns fromIndia, dating from 1700–1500 BC if not earlier, there is frequent mention of aplant called soma, which, when drunk, produced marvellous seemingly entheogeniceffects. One famous couplet states, in the 1896 translation by Ralph Griffith:We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light, the Godsdiscovered. Now what may foeman’s malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortalman’s deception?In the ancient Zoroastrian tradition, most probably the same substance was knownas hoama. Entheogenic researchers still debate whether the basis of soma andhoama may have been a psilocybin mushroom, the Amanita muscaria mushroom used inSiberian shamanism, some version of cannabis, opium or ephedra. It is alsopossible it was something similar to ayahuasca, as researchers have identifieddifferent plants, native to the Middle East and other regions, with the samechemicals and able to produce similar effects when combined.HinduismOne of the most unique characters in New York City’s ever-evolving shamanicunderground bears the same name as the Hindu deity of pure, immutableconsciousness: Shiva. In his decades of work with ayahuasca, peyote and sweatlodges, Shiva is probably responsible for introducing thousands of people toindigenous medicine traditions. At first glance, with his gangster limp, scruffygrey beard, and comfy nondescript clothes, Shiva looks, if anything, like astreet person or hustler – until you catch the wild gleam in his eyes.Shiva’s life reflects the last centuries of colonialism and globalization,haphazardly melding and remixing traditional cultures from across the planet.Born and raised in the 1940s in remote Guyana, Shiva’s parents were indenturedIndian labourers who worked on sugarcane and rice plantations. As a teenager, heread about the Kali Puja in the Amazonian jungle after attending a Catholicchurch on Sundays. It wasn’t until Shiva migrated to the US in his 20s that heattended one of the ayahuasca rituals he’d heard rumours about in the forest.“I ran into these two Samoan guys who introduced me to the peyote in the 70s,”he said. “I started hanging out with Native Americans – Lakota, Diné.” But Shivasaid he didn’t start getting serious about drinking medicine until a decadelater. “What attracted me the most was the girls,” he chuckles.Because of his eclectic heritage, Shiva doesn’t identify with any single group,and resists categorization: “I’m not a native. I’m not indigenous. I’m not evenwhite or black. So, it ticks them off – who is this Hindu guy?” In the medicinecommunity, Shiva is often thought of as a heyoka, a trickster. In Lakotatradition, the trickster is a “sacred clown”, overturning conventions andsubverting social norms. Following this path, Shiva rejects the rigidity oftraditional ayahuasca ceremonies. Since he never found a place within atraditional lineage, Shiva creates ceremonies that allow for creativeimprovisation and spontaneity. At the same time, he also works in the NativeAmerican Church tradition as a “Roadman”, leading peyote ceremonies that requireprecise adherence to discipline.Reflecting on the past 30 years serving medicine in Los Angeles and SouthAfrica, from abandoned mansions to squatted apartments and tipis, Shiva says hiswork with ayahuasca brought him “closer to home”, more connected to Hinduism.“One time during a prayer I saw this blob in the sky. It came closer and it wasGanesh. It wore all of these beautiful colours. Ganesh said to me: ‘There is noform. It’s formless. The creator is formless.’ ” Shiva gazes into the emptyBrooklyn street, watching a plastic bag dance in the wind.As ayahuasca traverses the world, it has also found its way to India, possiblythe country most identified with mystical states and the meditative explorationof higher states of consciousness. Vikram Raja, a former art dealer and venturecapitalist from Bombay, first encountered ayahuasca in India soon after he begana study of New Age esotericism. In one of his first ceremonies, he recalls:“This entity is talking to me but I don’t know who it is. This entity is givingme knowledge. I suddenly start to channel characters from the Ramayana.” TheRamayana is an ancient epic poem that tells the saga of King Rama, who mustrescue his wife Sita from the clutches of Ravana, a demon. The poem includes thepantheon of Hindu gods. During the ayahuasca ceremony, Raja said: “I saw how theRamayana expresses esoteric knowledge about the fight between good and evil. Irealized there’s a hero in each of us.”After this journey and many others, Raja sees ayahuasca in mythological termsthat relate to ancient Indian legends. When he visited Brazil to deepen his workwith the medicine, he found that, just as in India, there is a group of mysticscalled Nagas, who work with snakes and worship the energy of the serpent. Hemade a connection between the town he visited, Aiuruoca, and Arjun, a characterfrom the Mahabarata. “In the Mahabarata, Arjun travels though a portal throughthe centre of the Earth. He meets the Naga people and gets married to a snakegoddess. Then he comes out on the other side of the world. I felt that Aiuruocawas the place on the other side.”White-bearded Sri Prem Baba is a popular guru in India, teaching meditation,wearing the traditional white robes, recently accused of sexual misconduct. Hehas ashrams in Rishikesh, India, as well as Alto Paraiso, Brazil. Born in 1965in São Paulo as Janderson Fernandes, Prem Baba apprenticed with Santo Daime inBrazil before discovering his guru in India. He recalls, on his website:I passed through various spiritual paths and religions, including working withindividuals who served ayahuasca. I was connected to the Eclectic Center of theUniversal Flowing Light, left by Mestre Raimundo Irineu Serra for his disciples.This mediumistic work is based in Christianity, brought through the indigenousshamans and healers of the Amazon Forest. They use ayahuasca, an ancient andancestral beverage, as a vehicle to connect with other subtle planes ofexistence. While in these works, I noticed that all spiritual knowledgeconverged at the same point: discovering yourself. This self-knowledge went wellbeyond anything offered by the mind.Sri Prem Baba’s robust integration of yoga, meditation and ayahuasca pointstoward a new syncretism that may, eventually, become commonplace as humanity’sapproach to religion shifts from traditions based on received wisdom toknowledge grounded in experiential practice and direct transmission.JudaismFor almost two decades, governments around the world followed the United Statesin outlawing all scientific research on the effect of psychedelics on humansubjects. Following the social unrest of the 1960s, the US governmentcategorized substances like LSD, DMT and psilocybin as Schedule I drugs that hadno therapeutic value or possibility of beneficial use. Medical textbooks wererewritten, taking out almost all discussion of the volumes of scientificresearch done on these substances in the 1950s and early 1960s, when manypsychiatrists believed them to be the most important tools for exploring thehuman mind that we had discovered.The first study allowed on human beings after this long interdiction was aresearch project on the effect of injectable DMT, which took place at theUniversity of New Mexico in Albuquerque in the early 1990s. Dr Rick Strassman,the man behind this research project, was a Buddhist meditator with a Jewishbackground and a long-standing interest in Kabbalah. Strassman later wrote abouthis five-year project, giving 400 doses of DMT to dozens of research subjects,in his book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule.Strassman found what he considered to be a fascinating correlation betweenancient Buddhist scripture, which states that the soul reincarnates seven weeksafter death, and fetal biology, when he learned that the pineal gland appears 49days after conception. He suspected there might be some chemical correlate ofthis esoteric process. He learned that the pineal gland produces certainendogamous compounds, including melatonin, which helps regulate the sleep cycle,and DMT, which has no known function. He developed the hypothesis that DMT is akind of chemical compound that mediates the soul’s entry into the body andeventual exit from it.Through his DMT research, Strassman found that subjects routinely experiencedout-of-body experiences. Many reported “hyperspeed” contact with entities theydescribed as disturbingly alien. In fact, Strassman called an end to the projectafter a psychic told him that various noncorporeal entities were using hisclinical tests, conducted in a hospital without the spiritual protection of ashaman or traditional lineage, as an open gate to sneak into this world. Aroundthe same time, his wife developed cancer. The psychic suggested the cancer wassomehow linked to the entities he was unleashing through his experiments. At thesame time, his Buddhist teachers began to question his work. Although trained asa scientist, Strassman found these warnings to be worrisome. He also felt therewas nothing particularly therapeutic about the entity contacts andhyperdimensional dissolutions that subjects were reporting.Strassman’s research into DMT led him to undertake a deeper exploration intomystical Judaism, including the body of knowledge known as Kabbalah. Many yearsafter his DMT study, he published another book, DMT and the Soul of Prophecy: ANew Science of Spiritual Revelation in the Hebrew Bible (2014). He studied thevisionary experience described by Old Testament prophets like Maimonides andEzekiel. Strassman believes these visions were induced by a release ofendogenous DMT.Eastern traditions like Zen Buddhism have prioritized the “unitive-mystical”experience, ignoring encounters with spiritual entities as irrelevant or evendistracting. The ancient Hebrew religion, on the other hand, focused on mysticalcontact with divinity or spiritual emissaries that appeared in visionary states.“The appearance and behavior of beings in the Hebrew Bible, as well as theirrelationship with those apprehending them, share many features with those wefind in the DMT state,” Strassman writes.In his essay “Biblical Entheogens: A Speculative Hypothesis” (2008) Israelipsychotherapist Benny Shanon explores the hypothesis that ancient Israelitesused DMT-containing plants, such as acacia, with MAOI-containing seeds of Syrianrue (Perganum harmala) to induce divine experiences. The mixture of acacia withground-up Perganum harmala seeds creates a similar chemical effect as theAmazonian ayahuasca brew. This “ayahuasca analogue” can be made with plantsfound throughout the Middle East. Egypt also had a more temperate climate 5,000years ago, which means that a variety of local psychedelic and psychoactivebotanicals may have flourished in the region at that time.Reviewing the accounts of Moses’ revelations in the Old Testament, Shanontheorizes that “the Manna the people of Israel received from heaven during theirwandering through the Sinai desert was actually an entheogen”. According toShanon, the burning bush on Mount Horeb that gave Moses his visionary downloadswas, in all likelihood, the acacia bush, which contains DMT and releases it whentorched. In Egyptian mythology, the acacia tree “enjoys a very special status,being associated with the birth of the god Osiris and of that of the pharaohs,”Shanon writes. “Osiris was said to have been killed by being enclosed in acoffin from which an acacia tree sprouted; out of this tree Osiris (in otherversions, Horus) came out to life … the ancient Egyptians regarded acacia as the‘tree of life’.” Acacia grows in many climates around the world and may havebeen widely used as an intoxicant. Recently, aboriginals in Australia haverevealed they traditionally use the smoke from acacia to enter visionary trance.Shanon’s work resonated with Lev Natan, a soft-spoken sound healer and lifecoach from Boston, based in the Berkshires. Natan’s search for mysticalexperience led him to the Santo Daime. He loved the communal singing and thecommunion he felt with the medicine, but the Christian overlay of the religion(including the giant wooden cross above the altar) troubled him.“The translation of the word ‘Israel’ is to struggle with God,” Natan says. Forhim, this struggle has been a profound part of his faith, based on a deepquestioning and study. It led him to the Daime. He found, through ayahuasca, hesometimes had communication with Jesus Christ. “I started wrapping tefillin inthe woods, praying, when Jesus seemed to appear to me – not in a vision, but asan energy. I asked him, how do you explain the crusades, all of the horror ofreligion? ‘That wasn’t about me’ he said.”During one ceremony, Lev entered a mystical state of awareness shaped by hisbackground in Judaism: “I had a vision of this beautiful, glowing vesselsuddenly shattered into thousands of pieces. From each of the pieces were littleshards of light. The phrase tikkun olam – came to me.” In Hebrew, tikkun olammeans “to repair the world”. The phrase was developed in 14th century by theJewish mystic and Kabbalah master Isaac Luria.In Kabbalistic cosmology, the “shattering of the vessels”, shevirat ha-kelim,was a seminal event that occurred at the creation of the world. God filled theseparate vessels – of matter, individuality, and consciousness – with theprimordial energy or light that emanates from him. But the vessels were toofragile to hold the energy of the divine revelation, and they shattered. Thegoal of the righteous person, the tzaddik, is to gather up the shards or sparks,which are scattered across the world, and reassemble them into their originalstate of unity. By collecting these fragments, the world will be repaired andredeemed. Perhaps ayahuasca is, in itself, one of the fragments, one importantpiece of the lost knowledge that helps us, when we commune with the medicine, toremember and awaken.IslamWe find the interdiction against entheogenic plants embedded in the source codeof the monotheistic religions of the West. The rejection of the visionary toolsfound in nature starts with the story of Genesis, where God persecutes Adam andEve for eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. In thatformative myth of the West, God angrily throws them out of Eden before they dareto snack from the tantalizing fruit of the Tree of Life, which would make themhis equals. Shanon believes the story of the Tree of Knowledge supports hisclaim that the Biblical stories referred to use of entheogenic plants: “Whateverthe interpretation one gives to this pivotal story, one thing is clear – it isbeing told in a context in which people believed that knowledge could beobtained by means of the ingestion of plant material,” he writes.Gnosticism was once thought to be a heretical sect of Christianity. Today, mostscholars consider Gnosticism to be a remnant of the pre-Christian mystery schooltraditions. These continued in the ancient world for thousands of years, untilChristianity took hold. The Eleusinian mysteries, for example, dedicated to therites of Demeter, goddess of agriculture and fertility, may have descended fromancient Minoan cults dating back to 2000 BC. Some researchers believe thatvisitors to the annual rites of Eleusis imbibed an entheogenic cocktail. Theydrank a mysterious potion called the kykeon at a crucial point in the ritual.Its ingredients remain unknown, but may have been derived from a mushroom or afungus growing on ergot.The Roman Emperor Theodosius I, who declared Nicene Christianity the officialstate religion of the Roman Empire, ended the Eleusinian mysteries in 391. Theend of the Eleusinian Mysteries reflected a larger social transition fromexperiential religion based on initiation and illumination to text-basedreligion mediated by a professional priest class. As Christianity evolved, itbecame an exoteric religion that indoctrinated its subjects into a set of basicmoral precepts. The new religion of Christianity supported the increasinglyhierarchical civilization that developed in the centuries since. Scholar MartinP Nilsson in his book Greek Folk Religion (1972) wrote that the purpose of theEleusinian mysteries was “to elevate man above the human sphere into the divineand to assure his redemption by making him a god and so conferring immortalityupon him”. Such a sense of divine ordination based on self-knowledge did notmesh with the stratified social order, ruled by priestly authority, of theMiddle Ages and early modern period.Islam is the most recent of the three Abrahamic religions that accept the OldTestament as part of their doctrine. The origin of Islam is the prophetMuhammad. According to legend, Muhammad communed directly with the angel Jibrilor Gabriel in the early 7th century. He received the prophetic transmissionknown as the Quran, which remains the basis of Islam. The word “Islam” meanssubmission or surrender to the will of God. Over the past century, the liberalsecular ideals of Europe and the United States have come into increasingconflict with orthodox Islam, which maintains stringent controls over the livesof the faithful, restricting women’s freedom in particular.Islam forbids the use of drugs and intoxicants. In the Quran, Muhammad wrote:“Every intoxicant is khamr (alcohol) and all khamr is haram (unlawful).” It is,thus, astonishing to learn that Shi’ite Islam has recently changed its doctrineto permit research into entheogens as well as the consumption of them.In 2014, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mohammad Sadeq Hussaini Rohani, the highestauthority in Shi’ite Islam, announced in an edict that psychedelic drugs arelegal and can be used with the supervision of experts, under Islamic law.Shi’ite Muslims make up approximately 10–13 per cent of the global population ofroughly one billion Muslims. The Ayatollah’s edict makes (Shi’ite) Islam thefirst Abrahamic religion to officially accept the use and study of psychedelicsas instruments that can be integrated into a monotheistic religious structure.“This fatwa changes the whole configuration and contours of the global debateabout entheogens and religious freedom and directs it into a much more fertile,nuanced and positive direction,” notes the Islamic scholar and Sufi mystic NWahid Azal in a 2014 interview on the website Reality Sandwich. Azal helped toeducate the ecclesiastical Shi’i establishment about psychedelic substances. Hiswork prepared the way for this groundbreaking ruling, which he considers“historically momentous”, offering “positive future ramifications beyond eventhe world of Shi’i Muslims. From an orthodox Shi’i establishment figure such ashe, his is a refreshingly open-minded display”. Azal contrasts the Ayatollah’sapproach with the “nonsensical and totally obscurantist Islam of the Ṭālibān,the Wahhabīs of Saudi Arabia and their assorted worldwide Salafī cohorts whowould never dream of offering such a ruling under any context or circumstanceswhatsoever”.The Swiss-born Sufi mystical philosopher Frithjof Schuon sought to clarify themetaphysical doctrine of Islam as a religion based on divine revelation, atleast equal in its claim to authority as Judaism or Christianity. Unlike itspredecessors, which describe a relationship between humanity and a personalizedGod, Islam focuses on the absolute or unmanifest side of the divinity. InSchuon’s writings published in Splendor of the True (2013), he says: “IfChristianity is like a central fire, Islam on the contrary resembles a blanketof snow.” The kaleidoscopic domes, elegant arches, patterned carpets, andinterlaced mandalas of classical Islamic artwork suggests or intimates a realmof geometric perfection without being or end. In Schuon’s terms this art conveys“the recollection of a lost Paradise” as well as “the presentiment of a timelessBeatitude”.Much Islamic art features exquisite geometrical patterns very similar to whatone encounters on ayahuasca or DMT trips. A reductive materialist can only seethese patterns as a result of the intricate synaptical wiring of the brain.Jungians might propose we access archetypal visual material from the collectiveunconscious during psychedelic journeys. There may be other regions ofspace–time that we are able to visualize and explore in altered states.In particular, the experience of smoking 5-MeO-DMT – found in the secretions ofthe Bufo toad from the Sonoran desert of Mexico, as well as many plants – can bedescribed as an immersion in white shimmering crystalline lattices that seem toextend in all directions forever. At the peak of the 5-MeO-DMT trip, there is nosense of a separate entity or ego. The separate self entirely dissolves withinthis matrix, which seems the “timeless Beatitude”, absolute, or nirvana to whichall mystical traditions refer. The patterns recalled have a vaguely Islamiccaste.We lack any direct historical evidence that the Prophet Muhammed (or any of thefigures connected to the early years of Islam) explored psychoactive orentheogenic plants. However, there may be more discoveries ahead. Perhaps someform of hashish, acacia, or hoama helped inspire the revelation which remainsalive through its visual representations as Persian rugs (magic carpets) as wellas the fractal-patterned architecture of sacred Islam. The Ayatollah’s edict mayhave been inspired by esoteric stories or knowledge that psychoactive orentheogenic plants were used by the prophet and his followers. A journey withSyrian rue, the Middle Eastern analogue of the ayahuasca vine, containingbeta-carbolines harmine and harmaline – often induces intricate visions ofreddish geometrical patterns similar to the patterns found in many Persiancarpets.Those connected to Sufism, the mystical side of Islam, also make connectionsbetween entheogenic visions and Sufi philosophy. “I always gravitated towardSufism and the mystical aspects of Islam,” says Alnoor Ladha, the executivedirector of The Rules, a nonprofit focused on addressing global economicinequality. “In some ways that state is pre-knowledge, pre-cognition, and whatyou realize is that original vibration of Islam that came from the prophetMuhammed was a vibration of unity consciousness.” Born near Vancouver, Ladhacomes from a clan of Persian Sufis who trace their lineage back to the originalhashashins (assassins) of 9th-century Persia. Sufis, like the Gnostics or theKabbalists, preserved an initiatory tradition based on experiential practicesfor attaining intensified levels of consciousness.From his visionary experiences on ayahuasca, Ladha became convinced thatpsychoactive plants such as Syrian rue were part of Islam. The use of hash was,of course, part of the lifestyle of the hashashins, who were famous for theirdisciplined approach to murder and espionage. According to legend, the10th-century leader of the hashashins, Hassan-i Sabbah, established totalobedience through the use of a magical potion. When he gave it to his followersto drink in windowless chambers beneath the Alamut Fortress they would enter avisionary trance and see the paradise available to them if they remained devotedto the order. It is not impossible that this potion was a kind of ayahuascaanalogue.During one ayahuasca journey in Peru, Ladha “felt the presence of the prophetMuhammed very clearly. I’ve been in dialogue. There was somebody directly behindme, but my head was against a wall so I didn’t know where they would bestanding, and they starting singing chants in Arabic. It wasn’t a dzikr, but anArabic prayer I recognized – it could have even been Aramaic.” Ladha’s mother, apractising Sufi, describes her visions as Arabic calligraphy, with shimmeringpatterning, coming alive and communicating with her.Ladha believes that ayahuasca, as a living intelligence, tends to addresspeople, at first, in the cultural symbols and syntax appropriate to them. “WhatI notice with different people – whether they are Christian, First Nations,Jewish – those initial spiritual channels have a frequency. They come with a setof archetypes and ideology. These are used as vehicles of expression for themetaphysical plane of ayahuasca.”Religions and ideologies often conflict in our strife-torn world. But ayahuasca– and other entheogens – can induce immediate states of mystical gnosis andpresence. This direct access makes ancient dogmas and doctrines irrelevant.Entheogens reconnect people with what they will describe, after the fact, as atranscendent reality, a unified field of consciousness. Participants oftenrecall this state as blissful, eternal, beyond time, space, language andjudgement.Green revelationHumanity finds itself at a critical juncture. We are threatened by theecological catastrophe we have unleashed – climate change, species extinction,ocean acidification and so on – as well as futuristic technologies – AI, drones,genetic engineering – that may be weaponized and used in global conflicts. Notto mention nuclear weapons which already threaten us with immediateself-obliteration, if our bellicose political leaders were to miscalculate.As the level of anxiety rises and we approach two minutes before midnight on theDoomsday Clock maintained by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin ofthe Atomic Scientists, increasing numbers of people are starting to seek outmystical knowledge for themselves. They want the transmission of a visionarystate, or the direct experience of nonduality or unity consciousness. AlbertEinstein famously said that problems cannot be changed at the level ofconsciousness that created them. It seems obvious that humanity needs to make aquantum leap in consciousness, as a species, to avoid destroying ourselves alongwith our environment.If Einstein is right, we can only transform our world for the better when enoughof us reach a new level of consciousness. Evolution is prodding us to make aquantum leap – toward a transpersonal or integral perspective. From this vantagepoint, we can see the situation comprehensively, overcoming our embeddedbeliefs, ideologies and ego-driven desires. Ayahuasca, DMT, and other entheogenscan accelerate this leap. They are tools that help people receive directrevelation.It is only from such a higher-dimensional perspective, one that transcends andincludes outmoded ideologies, that we may overcome our parochial world views andclashing belief systems. If such experiences are properly integrated, people canattain a more encompassing vision. They can realize what Schuon called “thetranscendent unity of religions”.Back in the 19th century, the transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in hisessay “Introduction of Nature”:Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writesbiographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God andnature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy anoriginal relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry andphilosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us,and not the history of theirs?A new insight – a transformative vision for our future – has become a compellingnecessity for society as a whole.The growing global interest in the direct mystical experience produced byentheogens like ayahuasca – offering us “an original relation to the universe” –indicates we are on the cusp of a profound paradigm shift. This is a time ofaccelerated transformation, with Earth’s ecology and human society undergoingrapid mutations. As we leave behind the antiquated parts of religions based onancient text and received wisdom, we can access a new form of experientialmysticism based on the gnosis attained in visionary states of consciousness. Avast range of “mind-body states” wait to be explored. The global renaissance inpsychedelics and the rising popularity of ayahuasca suggest that atransformation in our basic paradigm of religion and philosophy is alreadyunderway."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11THE LAWIn its modern usage, the English word “drug” is an umbrella term, referring to abroad spectrum of substances that have a variety of physiological effects. Manypeople now believe that the only acceptable drugs are those manufactured bypharmaceutical companies and given legal status by governments. This is thecase, even though, under capitalism, “Big Pharma” stands to make profits on anysubstance patients need to take regularly, whether asthma medicine, syntheticnarcotic or antidepressant. We call legally distributed and socially prescribedsubstances “medicines”. Drugs taken outside of this context – stimulants,relaxants, narcotics, hallucinogens – tend to be framed by our culture asmalevolent and sinister or, at best, “alternative” and hence untrustworthy.Our culture is currently making a transition in its paradigm aroundpsychedelics. When they were rediscovered by Western scientists in the 1950s,substances like LSD and psilocybin were deemed “wonder drugs”: they revealedaspects of the psyche we had not been able to access before. In the 1960s, thesecompounds (including the DMT-containing ayahuasca) were demonized and madeillegal.Today, governments around the world are reassessing the potential of psychedelicsubstances. New medical and psychological research has highlighted theirbeneficial properties. The religious use of peyote, ayahuasca and othersacraments have also won legal protection in the United States and othercountries. New legal frameworks are incrementally taking shape.Canadian drug policy expert Kenneth Tupper notes that the metaphors used by themass media and policymakers to negatively characterize “bad drugs” (illegalpsychoactive substances) shape the popular imagination.Chemical agents like heroin, cocaine and amphetamine are often described as ifthey had personalities, with subjectivity and intention. Since the use of opiumand alcohol skyrocketed in the 19th century, the media has attributed to thesedrugs the power to “steal away” loved ones and “take over” their lives. Likeevil sorcerers, these forbidden substances seek to ensnare unwitting victimsinto their nefarious webs. Innocent people must be protected from them, at allcosts.“Embedded in this metaphor is the idea that the drug itself is a diabolicalforce with a talismanic or magical power,” says Tupper, “whereby even being inits proximity is dangerous, simple possession is reprehensible, trafficking isheinous, and all such transgression merits swift and forceful preventative orpunitive intervention.” These illicit agents get “trafficked” and “smuggled”.They comprise the lifeblood of shadowy underground economies, dwelling in themargins of our globalized world, providing incentives for gangsters, “ThirdWorld” dictators and criminals to perpetuate violence and shady moneylaundering. Mainstream society validates a range of artificial substancesrecently developed in laboratories. Substances like amphetamine (Adderall),fluoxetine (Prozac), and diazepam (Valium) are acceptable as additions to humanneurochemistry. Plants and chemicals which alter consciousness are seen asheinous monstrosities that need to be criminalized to protect the public order.Some of these compounds are naturally produced by plants, with a long benignhistory of human use.Many commentators note that the “war on drugs” is both a war on consciousnessand a class and race war. In the United States, punitive measuresdisproportionately impact minority populations, particularly African Americans.In some US states, nonviolent drug offenders such as those busted for possessionor sale of marijuana, spend years in prison and permanently forfeit theirability to vote. This is no accident.President Nixon launched the war on drugs in 1971. Around that time, his Chiefof Staff, H R Haldeman, wrote in his diary that Nixon “emphasized that you haveto face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is todevise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.” Criminalizingdrugs and targeting poor minority populations for their possession andtrafficking was a highly effective mechanism.The war on drugs is best understood as part of a larger regimen of control andindoctrination, designed to maintain a particular status quo and socioeconomicorder. According to the National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople (NAACP): “African Americans represent 12.5 per cent of illicit drugusers, but 29 per cent of those arrested for drug offenses and 33 per cent ofthose incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses.” One in fiveincarcerated people in the US are locked up for a drug offence, and the vastmajority of these are nonviolent offences.The United States Drug Enforcement Agency began the current system ofclassifying or “scheduling” substances in the mid-1960s, when drugs likemarijuana, heroin and LSD were seen as contributing to a new mood of popularunrest and civil disobedience. Because of the stature of the US in theinternational community, these classifications became the global standard in theearly 1970s, recognized by the United Nations International Narcotics ControlBoard.Lawmakers schedule substances on a scale of I to V, based on their perceivedmedical value versus the potential for abuse. Schedule I substances such asheroin, marijuana, LSD, MDMA and DMT are considered to have no accepted medicalvalue at all, and a high potential for abuse. These are not permitted to beadministered, even under medical supervision. Schedule II drugs such as codeine,morphine and oxycodone are similarly considered to have high potential forabuse, but can be distributed by healthcare providers.Ayahuasca occupies an ambiguous place in the laws and categorizationssurrounding licit and illicit substances. Ayahuasca drinkers often insist thatayahuasca is not a drug at all, but a medicine. The Santo Daime religionconfusingly argues that their sacrament is not even ayahuasca, albeit brewedfrom the same plants, but Daime, alchemically transmuted by its mystical statureamong devotees, much as the Catholic priest transmutes wafer and wine intoChrist’s body and blood through the Eucharist.When lawmakers decided to classify these substances over a generation ago, theymade little effort to research the provenance of these compounds or understandthe history of sacred plants that form an integral part of many traditionalcultures and tribal societies around the world. They overreacted to the totalambience of the counterculture of the late 1960s, which included the civilrights movement, the amplified power of psychedelic rock and roll, and the “backto the land” movement that diverted the best and brightest minds of the youngergeneration away from pursuing corporate jobs. By demonizing and criminalizingdrugs, as mentioned earlier, government reasserted repressive control over asociety that seemed to be teetering on the brink of revolution.Psychedelic proselytizer Timothy Leary, a former Harvard psychology professorwho abandoned a successful career in the establishment to promote chemicalecstasy, declared that the young should “tune in, turn on, and drop out”. Thepied piper of mind expansion was deemed “the most dangerous man in America” byRichard Nixon. Under the consciousness-expanding influence of substances likeLSD and marijuana, young men rejected the idea of becoming “organization men” ortechnocrats like their fathers.Conservatives saw the cultural fascination with hedonic substances as anonspecific threat to the entire social body. The establishment found themselvesin the position of Mr Jones in the famous Bob Dylan lyrics: “They didn’t knowwhat was happening here, but they knew enough to know they didn’t like it andthey wanted it to stop.”Subliminally, perhaps, conservatives felt intimations of a much deeper threat tothe bedrock foundations of Christianity, colonial empire, and patriarchy. In1970, the highly respected Princeton art historian John Allegro published agroundbreaking work, The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. Considered one of thebright lights of his generation of academics, Allegro’s eagerly awaited workargued there was a secret psychedelic mushroom cult within the origins ofChristianity. He found numerous frescos and icons dating back nearly 2,000 yearswhere the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden could be read as a red andwhite-spotted Amanita muscaria mushroom for those initiated into the cult – forthe uninitiated, it would appear as an apple tree.Allegro argued that the stories in the New Testament were “a literary device tospread the rites and rules of mushroom worship to the faithful”. He went so faras to argue that Christ was not actually a person, but represented the voiceheard by initiates during their mushroom journeys. While his book wasresoundingly ridiculed by the establishment, the threat to religious orthodoxiesremained.Ayahuasca remains tangled in international as well as country-specific legalperspectives and policies. On the international level, the main psychoactiveconstituent of the medicine is DMT, which is classified as a Schedule Isubstance according to the 1971 United Nations Convention on PsychotropicSubstances. Marijuana, mescaline (found in peyote and San Pedro), psilocybin andLSD also belong to this select Schedule I club, along with heroin and cocaine,all considered to have “a high potential for abuse” and “no currently acceptedmedical value”. Possession of any of these substances in the US remainspunishable by up to 30 years of imprisonment. In other countries, drug offenderscan be put to death.While federal governments ban DMT, mescaline, psilocin, psilocybin and otherpsychoactive compounds, concoctions made from plants or fungi they are derivedfrom are not explicitly subject to international control. The UN conventionpermits traditional communities in geographically specific areas to consumethese substance for ceremonial purposes only. Article 32.4 of the treatyspecifies that psychotropic plants may be used by indigenous groups if they growwild in a particular territory and “have been used traditionally by certainsmall, clearly determined groups in magical or religious rites”.International law around ayahuasca remains ambiguous. In many countries thereare no specific laws prohibiting the use of ayahuasca. A 2001 letter from theexecutive secretary of the UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)states:No plants (natural materials) containing DMT are presently controlled under the1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Consequently, preparations (egdecoctions) made from these plants including Ayahuasca are not underinternational control and therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the1971 convention.National governments therefore have jurisdiction over the legal status ofayahuasca in their territories. Many governments simply lack the informationneeded to rule upon the safety of the brew. In some cases, their drugenforcement agents may not even be aware of its existence or its use. However,the legalization of ayahuasca for religious and indigenous use in Brazil hascreated a significant precedent for the global community.The byzantine intricacies created by the drug war remain a major hurdle forpolicy makers as well as scientific researchers who want to study the effect ofpsychedelics on human subjects today. From the 1970s through the early 2000s,almost no legal research on giving psychedelics to human subjects was permitted.Over those decades, researchers who wished to study the effects of psychedelicplants and chemicals often risked their reputations and careers. They would endup navigating legal minefields, and often find themselves unable to do theirresearch even after years of effort.In the past decade, this situation has changed dramatically, partly due to thework of organizations like MAPS, the Heffter Research Institute, the BeckleyFoundation, as well as the dedication and diligence of many scientists. Today,there are probably hundreds of studies taking place around the world on LSD,psilocybin, ketamine, MDMA, ayahuasca and so on. The legal climate continues tochange unpredictably and may be substantively transformed over the next fewyears.The radical shift in US policy around marijuana over the past decade provides anindication and perhaps a foreshadowing for what is to come with otherpsychoactives that are currently interdicted. The legalization of marijuana hascreated new revenue for state governments, new business opportunities, and it isleading to the discovery of the extraordinary healing potential of CBD and othercompounds from the marijuana plant. At the same time, the regressive Republicanfederal government threatens to roll back these protections and target marijuanagrowers and dispensaries. We could easily see a return to the most brutalpolicies of the war on drugs – or we could see an end to punitive charges. In2001 Portugal made a radical move, decriminalizing possession and consumption ofall drugs. Since then, drug-incarceration rates, overdoses, HIV infection anddrugrelated crime has plummeted.The legal climate around psychedelic substances, including ayahuasca, hasalready started to change and may change drastically in the next few years, withresearch into MDMA leading the way. MDMA is currently in phase III FDA-approvedclinical trials for use as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD). In early trials, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has proved to beextraordinary effective for treating even treatment-averse forms of PTSD foundin veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars – a population with a tragicallyhigh suicide rate, often unable to acclimatize back into society. In thesetrials, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated a cure rate of more than60% – absolutely unheard of by other methods. The results are so convincing thatthe FDA has fast-tracked the approval process. Major far-right Republican donorslike Rebekah Mercer have contributed funds to complete the pilot studies.Approval of MDMA should widen the cultural aperture, allowing for thereconsideration and legalized use of psychedelic substances to heal particularsyndromes or complexes.Legality of ayahuasca in the USIn 1989, 27-year-old Donnie Bartley participated in his first ceremony with agroup of friends who had brought Daime medicine back with them from Brazil. “Ihad a history of trauma and depression,” Bartley recalls. “I had to flee my homewhen I was 15.” From his first encounter with Santo Daime, Bartley felt histrauma lifting. He developed a reverence for the sacrament as well as for thedepth of community he found around the church. Together, the group of friendsdecided to start the first Santo Daime branch in the United States in Cambridge,Massachusetts.Wanting to make sure they had the legal right to distribute the medicine,Bartley actually drove with a friend to the FDA’s office in Woburn,Massachusetts, with a litre of ayahuasca. Explaining it was a medicinal tea usedfor healing and prayer, they asked FDA agents if it was okay to import it fromBrazil to use in their ceremonies. They were given official permission. Thegroup arranged for a shipment of 10 gallons of Daime from their church inBrazil. On 21 May 1990, Bartley and a fellow church member got busted by theDrug Enforcement Agency (DEA).“All of a sudden, from every direction, around 50 men with guns the size ofcannons came running, screaming at the top of their lungs,” he recalls. Bartleyand his friend were put in a local jail, then transferred to federal prison inDanbury, Connecticut. They were charged as drug traffickers. Bail was set at aquarter million dollars each – far beyond the limited means of their fellowchurch members. From an affidavit, they learned that an undercover CIA agent inthe Santo Daime church in Brazil tipped off the federal authorities. Accordingto a second affidavit, one of the packages leaked, and customs agents claimedthey found positive results for LSD and marijuana. As Bartley now recalls, everytime they went to court, prosecutors read a different affidavit.Their case was tried in federal court under the legally conservative JudgeWalter J Skinner. Prosecutors used incidental evidence such as lyrics Bartleyhad scribbled in his notebook from a Patti Smith song mentioning heroin(actually a misspelling of “heroine”), and photographs of Brazilian womencleaning leaves during the ceremonial making of the medicine (which they claimedshowed a drug laboratory), as indications of nefarious intent. Bartley and hisco-defendant explained that Santo Daime was a religion and the name meant “holyprayer”. Judge Skinner ruled the defendants not guilty, although legalprotection was not extended to the sacramental use of ayahuasca at that time.In 1999, nine years later – coincidentally on 21 May once again – DEA agents, inanother dramatic raid, arrested Jeffrey Bronfman in Santa Fe, New Mexico, forpossession and intent to distribute a controlled substance. Bronfman was theAmerican leader of the União do Vegetal church from Brazil. Bronfman is one ofthe heirs to a large family fortune. His grandfather was a bootlegger whosmuggled vast quantities of whiskey into the United States from Canada duringthe Prohibition of the 1930s. When Prohibition ended in 1933, Bronfman wentlegit and founded the Seagrams company. The family became influential in manyindustries over the next few decades.It may be one of the great ironies of modern history that the grandson of thebootlegging Bronfman got arrested for importing another illegal and intoxicatingbeverage into the United States – but one with entirely different properties.After the 30 gallons of hoasca were confiscated, Bronfman decided to sue thefederal government on behalf of the DEA, asserting that their First Amendmentrights to practise their religion had been violated. Bronfman had the deeppockets and patience needed to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court.In 2006, the Supreme Court tried Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente Uniãodo Vegetal (UDV). This landmark case tested the constitutional legitimacy of thecountry’s drug laws against the First Amendment’s protection of religiousrights. Working on behalf of the Bush administration, the deputy solicitor EdwinS Kneedler argued that allowing for the distribution and consumption of hoascawould subvert the government’s anti-drug agenda and “challenge the status quo”.The crucial precedent for the eventual ruling in the UDV case came from the longlegal battle over the use of peyote by the Native American Church (NAC). In1989, the US Supreme Court took federal protection away from the NAC, making ita state-by-state decision whether or not to protect the sacramental use ofpeyote in church ceremonies. In defending his controversial decision inEmployment Division v. Smith, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that Oregon had theright to make peyote use a crime because this law applied to all citizensequally, and did not single out Native Americans. However, the effect of thiswas to take federal protection away from the NAC.The Supreme Court decision created an uproar among indigenous communities aswell as those who supported their right to practise their religion. Bowing tointense public pressure from over 60 groups, US senators issued the ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act in 1993. The ruling made it legal for all recognizedNative American communities to use peyote for religious purposes, on the federallevel. This protection of sacramental use of an otherwise interdicted Schedule Isubstance provided the precedent for the UDV, as well as the Santo Daime andother groups, to claim exemption for their use of a naturally occurring sourceof DMT.In Gonzales v. União do Vegetal, Justice Steven G Breyer referred to thecongressional ruling on the NAC, saying “peyote seems to have been administeredwithout the sky falling in”. Citing the wide distribution of trace amounts ofDMT in nature, Breyer noted that the treaty “doesn’t ban everything thatcontains DMT, for example an apple or a banana”. The judges decided the caseunanimously in favour of the UDV. However, due to subsequent legal challenges,it still took a number of years before UDV attained the legal right to openlyconsume hoasca at their church in New Mexico.Following on this precedent, the Santo Daime won protection of its use of thebrew from a federal court in Oregon in 2009 in another landmark case. JonathanGoldman, the Padrinho of Ashland’s Holy Light of the Queen Church, had packagesof the sacrament seized from him at home, and he was arrested on drug charges.In response, a small group of Daimistas in Portland and Ashland sued the federalgovernment, citing their right to take their religious sacrament as outlined inthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.Since the 2006 Supreme Court decision, no ayahuasca cases have been prosecuted –yet administrative corrections are happening. Most cases have ended in pleabargains, with the defendant pleading guilty. On 19 October 2010, an indigenousColombian ayahuasca healer, Taita Juan Agreda Chindoy was detained at the USborder and arrested by the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) forpossession of ayahuasca. He was charged with intent to distribute a Schedule Idrug, with a potential sentence of 20 years in prison. He was released a monthlater, with all charges against him dropped, on the grounds that ayahuasca is atraditional plant mixture used by indigenous people for medicinal purposes,rather than a drug that creates dependence.We may be seeing a permanent change in the legal status of ayahuasca, or astrategic decision on the part of the Drug Enforcement Agency to leave ayahuascaalone for a while. It is always possible that some future circumstance, such asa publicized death during a ceremony, may create the social and political willto open the issue of ayahuasca’s legal status again. The relatively elite statusof most first-generation drinkers, who tend to be white, middle class orwealthy, may have contributed to the outcomes of these cases. Also, there is noevidence that ayahuasca use leads to addiction or contributes to social harm.Substances like “bath salts”, methamphetamine and opiates are currently sweepingacross the US, with a resurgence of opiate addiction causing a public-healthcrisis. Perhaps the government has tacitly acknowledged that ayahuasca isharmless by comparison.However, outside of those belonging to one of the two main Brazilian religions,the use of ayahuasca remains a legal grey area in the US. Some practitioners arecurrently seeking to create their own US-based religions to gain governmentprotection. They believe the legal establishment of such churches will allow formore widespread sacramental and healing use, without the anxiety and secrecycurrently hovering over this rapidly expanding field.In the United States today, many practitioners of European descent cite thereligious freedom afforded to indigenous sovereign nations to protect their ownuse of ayahuasca – as well as psilocybin, peyote and marijuana. Thesepractitioners ride upon the coat-tails of previous rulings, asserting thatayahuasca is a religious sacrament and, thus, constitutionally protected. Theseclaims trouble some who feel the battles fought by Native American groups forthe right to practise their religions is being exploited by freeloaders seekingto protect their forays into psychoactive gnosis, without a deep grounding inlineage or tradition. In some cases, they may also seek to profit from themedicine, creating retreat centres or even cults around their personas.A couple of years ago, the underground ayahuasca community recoiled in shockwhen advertisements for the Soul Quest Church of Mother Earth, based in Orlando,Florida, started to pop up in their Facebook feed. The ads promoted “LifeChanging Events in the USA”. Up until then, shamans marketed ayahuascaceremonies in the US in a stealthy manner, without using the medicine’s name,through emails sent to underground networks of seekers. Soul Quest’s marketingcampaign obliterated the secretiveness around ceremonies in the US that manybelieved helped protect ayahuasca from government scrutiny. At the same time, bygoing so public, Soul Quest arguably democratized ayahuasca, which has mostlybeen accessible to welleducated urban elites in the US.Soul Quest’s founder Christopher Young, a former merengue dance instructor fromLouisiana who followed a unique trajectory in working with visionary plantmedicine, wants to bring the medicine to the people. Growing up dirt-poor,raised Southern Baptist, Young started working in eighth grade, cuttingdoughnuts at a doughnut shop, then at Taco Bell. At 16, he worked two jobs,making $3.85 an hour. In search of a better life, he decided to escape toFlorida.Living in Fort Myers, then Naples, Florida, in his early 20s he got into DJing –“weddings and birthday parties” – while working as a dance instructor. He washired by cruise ships where his job was dancing the cha-cha, merengue andfoxtrot with older women passengers.Young rejected Christianity early on. “I went to a Catholic school. To me, itwas all just bullshit. How can a whole group of people kill millions uponmillions of people because they don’t believe in someone’s faith?” While inFlorida, he met a German woman, and moved to Germany with her where they had adaughter. It was on a visit to Ibiza with his family that Young encounteredayahuasca for the first time. He decided to join an 11-day retreat with aPeruvian curanderos because “I felt lost. I was looking for answers. I had thesame questions a lot of people ask: ‘What is my purpose? Where do I belong? Whydid all this happen to me and why I am still here?’”On his first journey, Young had no visions but was cured of sciatic pain in hisback that had tormented him for years. “I felt a warm hand go around that areaand get really, really hot. Then, all of a sudden, the pain was gone.” For thefirst time in his life, during those journeys: “My mind was still. My body wasstill. And I felt someone was watching over me. I could feel something there. Ifthat was all I got out of the experience, it would have changed my life.”Throughout the week he received downloads, memories, images. “I couldn’t makeheads or tails of what was going on. The shaman said it was ‘de-fragging’ mymind, taking things away that no longer needed to be there. Cleaning house.”He returned home to his wife. At night, in the liminal zone between sleep andwaking, he kept having visions of “two shadow people. They would come closer andcloser to me, and the only thing I could see was their eyes, these two shadoweyes. And the closer they got to me, I actually felt like I was coming out of mybody.” One night, the shadow people asked him to go with them up to the roof. Hefollowed them:The two shadow people were sitting on the roof of the house. They had aconversation with me and they started out speaking simple words: “What wasbefore is not lost. It shall come back. But before this can come back, you haveto do something.” They went on to tell me, “Ayahuasca left the jungle a longtime ago, to save it’s own existence. Ayahuasca has been looking for people allover the world, light workers, healers, people that can help bring the medicineto the people. And that’s why you’re here, because you’re one of those people.You have a heart.”The shadow people gave Young specific instructions, telling him: “Go back toyour home country and you will be able to open up a church and you’ll be able toteach from something called the Ayahuasca Manifesto.” He had never heard of theAyahuasca Manifesto. Googling it later, he discovered it was an anonymous book,published online in 2012 as channelled material (later the highly regardedEcuadorian curandero José Campos admitted authorship). Claiming to be speakingfor the spirit of ayahuasca, the manifesto stated:With the authority vested in me by the higher enlightened hierarchies, l willexpand, branch out and transform into multiple cultural forms in accordance withtheir geographical regions. I will blend into every culture and will teach themthe way to the Light, while allowing them to exercise their powerful free will.Convinced that the shadow people were authentic messengers from the spiritualworld, Young decided to follow their advice. He visited Brazil and apprenticedwith servers who worked with the Santo Daime. He moved with his family toFlorida and opened a small medicine retreat in Orlando.He used the Native American Church as a precedent, as well as the OklevuehaNative American Church (ONAC), an offshoot that claimed it was able to offerlegal protection to anybody who served medicine, who got a membership card. “Thething is, they sold a pipe dream,” Young says now. After a year, “we found outthat the ONAC, that we were a part of, was a sham.” He left the ONAC and foundedhis own religion, The Soul Quest Church of Mother Earth.Young then built Soul Quest, where, he estimates, he has already served at least7,000 spiritual seekers, lost people, sick people needing healing. He charges$350 for a weekend retreat, including food, places to rest, and two ceremonies.“Remember I wasn’t a believer in religion. I wasn’t a believer until I actuallyfelt the medicine and how it worked. Religion is a manmade thing, butreligiousness is something that we can be in and believe – spirituality.Religion is where you’re being told by somebody what you do. Religiousness issomething you do for yourself.” The documentary, From Shock to Awe (2017),features Young’s courageous work with veterans from the Iraq War suffering fromtreatment-averse forms of PTSD.When asked why he promotes his medicine work so publicly, Young replies:The quicker we can get this out, the faster we can save humanity. Because themore people that consume the medicine, the more people want to do better, wantto help the Earth. There’s millions of people that believe in a God that they’venever seen. But those same millions of people destroy the earth that gives themlife. If they would realize that the God that they have never seen is actuallythe God that they see every day, they would change their life and theirperception.In August 2016, Young received a letter from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA),notifying him they had learned of his retreat center,” where he “providedayahuasca and other controlled substances to [his] clientele”. According to theletter, the DEA knew Young worked with a number of controlled substances.Instead of taking action, he was invited to apply for exemption under theReligious Freedom Restoration Act. The DEA wrote that they were “happy to answerany questions” about the application process.Young’s lawyer sent a 157-page long response to the DEA. Two years later, theyhave received no response. Despite this uncertainty, Young and his colleaguescontinue to serve ayahuasca and other plant medicines to hundreds if notthousands of people who seek healing and self-knowledge, reaching a widedemographic. The majority of their visitors discover the center through Facebookmarketing or word of mouth. For Young, this work is his spiritual mission, andhe is willing to persist despite the threat of government reprisal.Soul Quest continues in a legal limbo. Nobody knows if Young’s bravado will leadto his prosecution, or if he will have demonstrated that ayahuasca can now bemarketed freely, as long as there is some kind of religious exemption.The DEA sent me a letter saying I got three to 12 substances. Schedule I, theworst of the worst. A conviction carries 20 years. I don’t know anybody everreceived a letter saying, hey dude, you have three to 12 substances. Fill outthis paper stating that you want to become exempt. That’s what they did. Andthat’s what we did. We wrote a 157-page exemption letter and we sent it to them,to challenge the right for us to use the medicine.They stopped treating clients for several months, awaiting further actions fromthe DEA. When they heard nothing further they resumed their treatments. “This isa religious freedom,” he says. “It’s already been proven in the Supreme Court.This is the law of the land.”International lawsWhile the United States has moved toward legalizing ayahuasca for sacramentaluse in a series of landmark cases, and while medical research on psychedelicscontinues to find new applications of these substances for mental health, manyother countries and regions continued punitive policies when it comes toayahuasca. Noting the growth of public interest in visionary plants, some haveincreased their scrutiny and prosecution of ayahuasca users and practitioners.Soon after the 2006 Supreme Court verdict in the UDV case, a tidal wave ofarrests began as ayahuasca’s internationalization swept across the globe. Franceset the precedent for the most restrictive policies on mindexpanding substances,outlawing ayahuasca.In January 2010, Benjamin De Loenen, director of the International Center forEthnobotanical Education, Research & Service (ICEERS), received a call from aprison in Chile. De Loenen started ICEERS in 2009 to research and promote theresponsible use of visionary plant psychedelics, particularly ayahuasca andiboga. The organization supports research at a university in Brazil intoibogaine as a treatment for alcoholism. They have also launched PsychePlants(psycheplants.org), an online hub for information about psychoactive plants andtheir potential benefits for mental health. ICEERS “sees the legal acceptance ofthis psychedelic as a catalyst for more humane drug policies around the globe”.On the other end of the call from Chile were two ayahuasca servers from theManto Wasi ayahuasca centre located in Pirque, near Santiago de Chile. A recentceremony had been brutally interrupted by a swarm of fully armed narcoticsagents. The servers faced up to four years imprisonment, charged withendangering public health and drug trafficking. According to an anthropologistwho studied the case later, the arrest in Chile was used as an opportunity tolaunch “propagandistic, pseudo-scientific discourses” against ayahuasca in thepress. The accused were demonized. One lost her job as a clinical psychologistdue to the media hysteria.Although De Loenen’s background was in media – as a student in the Netherlandshe directed a 2004 documentary about ibogaine – he felt he was someone who couldact to help the Chileans and others like them. He brought together a team oflawyers, scientists and policy experts in an attempt to redefine the laws aroundayahuasca in a way that would protect practitioners and drinkers. ICEERS sent aletter to the International Narcotics Control Board whose response reiteratedthe 1971 convention’s standing: No DMT-containing plants or mixtures are illegalby international standards. Each country determines the legality of thesubstance individually.This meant that ayahuasca was not technically illegal in countries, like Chile,which had not developed a legal framework around the medicine. In such a murkylegal territory, the arrest of the practitioners without warning could not bejustified. The team assembled by De Loenen put together a compelling case,bringing in experts who testified on the therapeutic potential and beneficialeffects of the medicine. In the end, Chile ruled that DMT in its pure orextracted form is illegal, but ayahuasca which contains DMT is not. All chargeswere dropped against the practitioners and a new precedent was set for protectedlegal use of the medicine.As a result of this case, De Loenen realized there was a need for anorganization that could help shape the legal precedents around ayahuasca,internationally, by offering empirical evidence as well as challengingsensationalist depictions of ayahuasca – put out by opportunistic journalistsand prosecutors – as a dangerous hallucinogen. Shortly thereafter, heestablished the Ayahuasca Defense Fund as a part of ICEERS, which functions as alegal support system for those persecuted for use or possession of the Amazonianmedicine. “Generally, judges know about cocaine dealers with guns and violenceand lots of money,” De Loenen explains. “But with ayahuasca, there’s a personwith some feathers doing a ceremony. Judges have no idea what they have in frontof them.”At this point, the global legality of ayahuasca is a patchwork. It is legallyaccepted or at least tolerated in most Latin American countries, with differentproscriptions around its use. For example, in Brazil, indigenous use is allowedwhile “ayahuasca tourism” was made illegal over the past decade. Most Europeancountries continue to take a repressive stance. The French government officiallyoutlawed ayahuasca in 2006. In 2016, British Parliament approved a bizarreblanket ban on “any substance intended for human consumption that is capable ofproducing a psychoactive effect”, presumably covering ayahuasca, while exemptingalkyl nitrites, or “poppers”, often used in clandestine sexual trysts. Althoughdrugs are, in some cases, decriminalized in Spain, it has racked up the largestnumber of arrests for ayahuasca possession and trafficking – 40 ayahuascaarrests were made in Spain from 2010 to 2015.Despite its reputation as a haven that permits use of prohibited psychoactivesubstances, the Netherlands has also cracked down hard on ayahuasca trafficking,with a number of high-profile cases over the past few years. In 2016, over 100kg of ayahuasca was confiscated in Amsterdam’s main airport, coming from theSanto Daime church in Brazil. The prosecutor’s arguments in the case drew upon a2014 decision made by the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded thatDMT must remain a prohibited substance to protect public health. After aninitial loss, the case has been taken to appeal, but the outlook remains grimfor Holland’s ayahuasca community as the legal system there has no sympathy forchemical mind-expansion.France is one of the only countries to specifically forbid the consumption ofayahuasca. For the French government, this is part of a wider policy ofintolerance toward many forms of religious expression. In 2004, they passed alaw that banned the display of religious symbols in public schools, particularlytargeted toward the Muslim hijab. The following year, France outlawed not onlythe use of the substances but even the possession of any plants from a longroster of psychoactive plants. The list includes Banisteriopsis caapi, Peganumharmala, Psychotria viridis, Diplopterys cabrerana and mildly psychoactivealkaloids harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine, harmol and harmalol.Canada’s Controlled Drug and Substance Act outlaws the possession ofDMT-containing substances including ayahuasca, and also bans the other alkaloidsfound in the Banisteriopsis caapi vine – harmine, harmaline andtetrahydroharmine – which are not proven to produce hallucinogenic effects. DMTis listed as a Schedule III drug in Canada, with its use or traffickingpunishable by up to three years in prison. “While ayahuasca is no doubt illegalin Canada, there seems to be very limited activity by law enforcement toactually prosecute people for possession of ayahuasca or even importing themedicine into Canada,” notes one website devoted to ayahuasca use in Canada.As discussed earlier, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mohammad Sadeq Hussaini Rohani, thehighest authority in Shi’ite Islam in Iran – a Muslim country with strict banson illicit substances – recently issued a fatwa announcing that entheogenicdrugs are permissible (halal) for Muslims under traditional Islamic law, whentaken under the supervision of a trained specialist. According to Wahid Azal, anIslamic scholar and Sufi mystic of the Fatimiya Sufi Order:The equivalent to Grand Ayatollah Rohani’s ruling in an analogous Westerncontext would be for the Vatican to make a similar finding for Roman Catholics.Indeed, this is how big this is, and so, as a singular development, it shouldnot be taken lightly or underestimated by anyone.The decision was made after 18 months of study of works like Benny Shanon’s TheAntipodes of the Mind. One basis for it may have been the recognition thatpsychoactive plants native to the Middle East, such as Syrian rue and Mimosahostilis, which can be combined with a similar chemical effect as ayahuasca –were used traditionally.To conclude, ayahuasca remains at a legal crossroads. The potential for wideradoption, with regulation, exists in many countries. But many countries, also,maintain repressive laws prohibiting its use. This remains the case despitestrong evidence and research proving that ayahuasca is not physically addictiveand does not have a negative impact on physical or psychological health, unlikelegal substances such as alcohol and nicotine. In fact, ayahuasca seems todemonstrate anti-addictive properties as well as physical and mental-healthbenefits for many drinkers."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURAYAHUASCA TODAY AND TOMORROW"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12TOWARD THE STARSLife, death, yagéOver the past decade, New York City has become a major centre of the globalneo-shamanic underground. In the 2016 article about the phenomenon in the NewYorker, Ariel Levy quoted a researcher, Leanna Standish, who estimated that “onany given night in Manhattan, there are a hundred ayahuasca ‘circles’ going on”.While this may be a slight exaggeration, there is no doubt that ayahuasca’spopularity has been growing for some time. Levy drank the brew in a crowdedBrooklyn yoga studio near McCarren Park, in an all-women’s ceremony. In herpiece, she hits all the usual notes:I was stunned that divine consciousness – or really anything – could smell quiteso foul: as if it had already been vomited up, by someone who’d been on a steadydieta of tar, bile, and fermented wood pulp. But I forced it down, and I wasstoked. I was going to visit the swampland of my soul, make peace with death,and become one with the universe.Although this didn’t happen exactly, by the end of the noisy, smelly ceremony:“I felt content and vaguely delighted and temporarily free.”Like other scenes now found in many cosmopolitan areas around the world, fromLondon to Cape Town to Ibiza, the neo-shamanic subculture in New York Cityoffers a rich bouillabaisse of colourful characters. They gather in the sharedpursuit of intense experiences, visionary illuminations, personal healing andcommunity bonding. Some are former drug addicts who have discovered that theirneed for the mainstream “drugs of abuse” masked an authentic yearning forcommunion encounters with the divine – a need now met by regular journeys intothe outer reaches of consciousness with sacred plants taken in ceremony.The ever-changing crowd includes dancers, DJs, permaculture designers, mysticalanarchists, investment bankers, software designers, surgeons, former HasidicJews, Burning Man sculptors, graduate students researching critical theory andmodern art history, and almost anyone else one can imagine with a ragingcuriosity for the novel and gnostic. For some of them, their journeys with thevisionary vine start out as a hobby but become a life-changing andidentity-defining activity. In some elite social circles, it is almostembarrassing – as cringe-worthy as never attending Burning Man – if you haven’tswigged some foul-smelling yagé brew, at least once or twice.Where Buddhist practitioners seek an abiding absorptive calm, the shamanicarchetype involves ongoing death-and-rebirth journeys – descents into the abyssfollowed by ecstatic flights through angelic realms of the spirit. Rinse andrepeat, ad infinitum. Those who choose this path often find themselvesconfronting dark nights of the soul, precipitous drops into personaldissolution, experiences of the razor-sharp edge in many areas of life. Theshamanic path is, by its very nature, a roller-coaster – and initiation into itis not meant for everyone.Isabella grew up in the suburbs of Connecticut, raised by a family of doctorsand academics. However, even before entering college, Isabella found herselfpulled toward healing and energy work. At New York University, she designed herown major in healing arts, exploring yoga and reiki. In 2008, on a lush greenproperty in upstate New York, she drank ayahuasca for the first time. At thestart of the ceremony, she felt extremely nervous and selfaware. Soon afterdrinking, she lost consciousness entirely.“I don’t remember what happened. Everyone was staring at me, because I wassinging!” recalls Isabella, an angelic-looking 28-year-old with sky-blue eyesand long golden hair woven in braids. The fact that she was singing as she cameto was shocking to her because she feared singing in public. As a kid, she hadbeen told she was tone deaf. The judgement hung over her. She hadn’t tried tosing in years. “I was so embarrassed,” she says. Isabella found that not onlycould she sing – her voice, her friends told her, was lovely. Her life changedirrevocably as a result of her first ceremony “I felt like I had come home,” sherecalls.Diego, the curandero, invited her to the next week’s gathering. A slender manfrom Guyana, he had studied for years with the Shipibo in Pucallpa. Over thenext few months, she followed Diego to dozens of ceremonies across the AmericanNortheast. She became the shaman’s assistant, sending emails, filing medicalwavers, washing out buckets, printing songbooks.Ayahuasca quickly became her full-time job, integral to her life and identity.For a year she continued apprenticing with Diego until he went back to Peru tocontinue his training. At a ceremony a few weeks after Diego’s departure, shemet Simón.Simón came from Cali, a bustling city in Colombia known for its salsa clubs andneo-colonial architecture. He was tall, broad shouldered with bright hazel eyesand dark brown skin, and a powerfully charismatic presence when leadingceremonies. They began to work together, serving medicine on a weekly basis –soon they moved in together. Within six months of their first meeting, Isabellawas pregnant.They travelled the global ayahuasca circuit, bringing ayahuasca to Europe, thenreturning to South America. On social media, one could follow the glamorouscouple through photos of the pair, decked out in beads, feathers and colouredgarments, serving medicine in rainforests and relaxing on pristine beaches. Theygot married in Hawaii a few months before the birth of their first child.Street-smart and eloquent, Simón was a rising star in the neo-shamanicunderground. They travelled with an ever-changing entourage of musicians andhealers. During a cross-country trip through Canada to serve medicine, Simónfound their medicine was disappointingly weak. Many people had signed up – morethan anticipated. Simón decided to fly to Colombia to procure stronger medicinefrom a taita he knew by reputation. He was meant to return in a week. On the dayIsabella expected Simón’s return, she received a phone call instead.On one of his last nights, Simón sat in ceremony with the taita near thePutumayo river. In the morning, Simón drank an unusual medicine – chinchaja(Gaultheria insipida) – a lesser-known psychoactive plant native to the Andes, aleafy shrub with red buds. Curanderos use it to treat conditions ranging fromlaziness and excessive sleeping to body pains. Traditionally used by the Ingapeople of the Sibundoy region, chinchaja is said to be a very powerful plantthat few know how to handle properly. Under the effects of chinchaja, Simón’sheart stopped. At the time, Isabella was pregnant with their second child.Rumors about Simón’s death swirled through the international ayahuascacommunity. People conjectured that he died as a result of sorcery or thatenvious local shamans had poisoned him. Others were suspicious of his emergentsuper-shaman globetrotting persona. There were rumours, also, that he had abusedhis position for sexual and monetary reward. People wondered if his ego got toobig for the job – and the medicine retaliated. The fact is, nobody will everknow for sure.Simón’s memorial was held in a high-ceilinged loft packed full of house plantsand people in Brooklyn. The wake brought together the medicine community of NewYork: hippie healers, wrinkled Sioux elders, stonefaced Colombian yagéceros,women old and young in embroidered dresses – holding flowers, eating snacks,strumming guitars, burning sacred saps and singing sacred songs.Isabella stood up, her small frame bulging, eight months pregnant. She addressedthe crowd with dignified poise, without shedding a tear. One by one, friends andfamily stood in front of the room and shared songs. Fredy Velásquez, the leadsinger of Grupo Putumayo, stood up cloaked in a poncho, and strummed adevastatingly beautiful hypnotic melody on his charango while belting out a song– en los manos de dios, todo se arreglará – “in the hands of God, everythingwill be fixed”. A laminated piece of paper the size of a playing card was passedout. On it was a picture of Simón smiling, wearing a magnificent featheredheaddress. Hasta las estrellas – “Toward the stars!” – it read, with the datesof his birth and death.In the months following Simón’s death, Isabella retreated to her parent’s homewith her babies. In this unfamiliar period of solitude, she reflected on herrelationship with Simón and her path with the medicine. “I didn’t know what tobelieve, who to trust – I questioned the medicine even more, did the medicinekill my husband?”She, too, wondered if sorcery had played a hand in his death, or if she had donesomething to deserve the terrible unfolding of events. Had she handled herresponsibilities properly, as a young woman of European descent, serving anindigenous medicine on the other side of the world?One day a visitor came to stay in her house. He had been a friend of Simón’s. Hehelped her cook meals, clean the boys, kept her company. He kept asking her whenshe would be ready to return to a ceremony. The community was waiting to welcomeher back, he said.“It took me a while to come back to the medicine,” Isabella recalls. She finallyovercame her resistance nine months after Simón’s death. When she sat inceremony for the first time in the nine months since Simón’s death, it was anemotional journey. “When I drank, I knew I couldn’t turn back on my life.” Shewept for the first time in months, purging her grief until she came to arealization: “I either totally trust and surrender to her mystery, or I die tolife. Nothing else makes sense.”Isabella lives with her children in upstate New York, making a living as ahealer. She continues on the medicine path, facilitating ceremonies. As ahealer, ayahuasca remains her primary tool.Neo-shamanismIn 1980, in Montana, a group of indigenous elders representing communitiesacross North America – Hopi, Navajo, Chippewa-Cree, and Muskogee – gathered forthe 5th annual meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle. At the end of thegathering, they issued a resolution aimed at the increasing numbers ofnonindigenous practitioners of medicine traditions and shamanism. Theyproclaimed:The medicine people are chosen by the medicine and long instruction anddiscipline are necessary before ceremonies and healing can be done. Theseprocedures are always in the native tongue; there are no exceptions and profitis not the motivation.They warned against teachings from inauthentic sources:… be warned that these individuals are moving about playing upon the spiritualneeds and ignorance of our non-Indian brothers and sisters. The value of theseinstructions and ceremonies is questionable, may be meaningless, and hurtful tothe individual carrying false messages.The elders’ resolution was just one salvo in the long-running struggle betweenthose who seek to defend and preserve indigenous traditions – whether they are,themselves, native or not – and Westernized neo-shamans, a term that generallycarries a negative charge. Robert J Wallis writes in Shamans/Neo-Shamans:Ecstasy, Alternative Archaeologies, and Contemporary Pagans:There is certainly a snobbish and derisive tone in much literature onneo-Shamanisms: real shamans are perceived to be culturally distant and Other,and therefore “authentic”; neo-Shamans are invented, deluded, and specious.According to Wallis, contemporary neo-shamans often have “highly pluralizedbeliefs and practices”, influenced by “a syncretism of reactionary thought andpostmodernism”. Some neo-shamans blatantly seek to commodify their presumedaccess to hidden or secret sources of knowledge. “At their most modern,individualistic and conservative, neo-Shamans teach business executives how tocontact ‘spirit guides’ which can help them make more money,” Wallis notes. Onthe other hand, he writes that many Western practitioners earnestly pursueesoteric disciplines in a quest for spiritual development: “Many neo-Shamans areactive seekers of shamanic knowledge: the individual, agentic quality ofneo-Shamanic practices must not be forgotten.”Young people disenchanted with the Western materialist paradigm travel to India,Nepal or Peru, seeking life-changing mystical experiences facilitated by a guruor shaman. Going into these places open minded, ready to change, they often findwhat they’re looking for: new meaning, a re-enchanted view of the world. Mantrastake on a new resonance. Teacher plants become sentient beings. Spirits suddenlylive everywhere – in the wind, under rocks and in fire.But how meaningful is this transition, really, when it’s abstracted from thehistory, ecology and lived experience of organic communities? How is itqualitatively different from tourism that extracts the beauty of an exoticlocale, turning it into what the anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu called “culturalcapital” that becomes part of a lifestyle and a résumé? How can we absorb theanimist ideas of traditional cultures – taboos, supernatural healing,spirit-beings – without stealing or appropriating from cultures that havealready had so much taken from them, first through Colonialism and then as aresult of industrial civilization’s rapacious expansion?Post-secular mysticismAccording to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of American adults say they’reatheists, agnostic or “spiritual but not religious”. These spiritual but notreligious people explore transcendence, community and meaning beyond anyparticular institution or community; instead, they weave together parables,rituals and beliefs from many different religious traditions. They often arriveat this knowledge via the internet, books or transformational festivals likeSymbiosis, Boom or Burning Man. This new-age picking and choosing comes with anewfound liberation from dogma and commitment. Some, almost overnight, adoptbelief in invisible energetic forces, speaking a language completely unfamiliarto their families and friends with mainstream jobs and quotidian concerns.Is the shamanic renaissance – what Terence McKenna called the “archaic revival”– just a fleeting fad, or does it represent something much deeper: the beginningof a sea change in the collective psyche of humanity? It can only be a positivesign of the times that many privileged people from today’s postindustrialsociety – a culture of digital distraction and instant gratification – turn tovisionary plant medicines. As we have described, an ayahuasca journey is anintense enterprise involving many hours of nausea, sometimes terrifying visions,confrontations with one’s inner demons and flaws, culminating usually in adrastic purge. In many Amazonian communities, only the curanderos and mysticswould undergo such an inner confrontation. These days, thousands of Westernizedseekers pursue it regularly, sometimes fanatically.We live in a culture that entrains people to seek material comforts. Why, then,are so many being drawn to the harsh, sometimes brutal, lessons offered by theplant teachers? There seems to be something innately human about the yearningfor spiritual knowledge, gnosis and initiation. Some subset of humanity feelsthe intense drive for inner experience that can be authentic, dangerous,revelatory, transformative and even sacred. This yearning for initiation seemsto be hard-wired into us.As Joseph Chilton Pierce explores in The Biology of Transcendence (2002),adolescents universally await some threshold experience or journey into theunknown. He finds the reason for this in our prefrontal cortex. This part of thebrain, which makes us distinctly human, only fully developed in the past severalhundred years. The prefrontal cortex gives us the capacity to use abstractsymbols like language and mathematics and to plan for the distant future. Italso gives us our sense of individual identity or ego, which makes us feelseparate and alone.Young people, Pierce notes, intuitively seek a transcendent shock – somethingthat reconnects them to the cosmos and transcends their sense of being isolated,a “skin-encapsulated ego”. Adolescents are drawn toward dangerous extremebehaviour like taking drugs as well as various physical ordeals. This mayrepresent their efforts to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness, to findsomething mystical and beyond the ordinary.Indigenous cultures around the world developed techniques of initiation thatincluded ordeals such as fasting, walkabouts and ingestion of visionary plants.These rites of passage push the shamanic candidate – generally, but not always,an adolescent – into a non-ordinary or visionary state of consciousness. Throughinitiatory breakthroughs, they realize themselves as part of a larger cosmicunity.Pierce believes that initiations have a neurological or biological function, notjust a cultural one – they spur a second stage of development of the prefrontalcortex. Without such a mystical jolt, many people end up as callow,self-interested and bored – trapped in their egos. Modern postindustrialcivilization seems to be full of “kidults” who take no responsibility for thecommunity as a whole, and feel disconnected from the health of their localecosystem or the fate of Earth. Their lack of initiation into transpersonalstates leads to an overidentification with their personal needs and a dismissalof any concerns, such as ecological threats, that do not impact them or benefitthem in the short term.Modern society developed a set of techniques to distract people and keep themfrom fulfilling their innate yearning for transcendence. People are trained,instead, to consume degraded substitutes that take the form of mediatedspectacles – films, Netflix series, sporting events, rock concerts, video games.The incessant bombardment of distractions eventually degrades our capacity tothink or to feel.This is why, when people first encounter the “vine of souls,” they often feelsuch profound gratitude and humility. Receiving direct access to visionaryrealms and floods of healing insight, they discover a renewed appreciation fornature, and understand the interconnectivity of all life on Earth. The rock starSting said that when he drank ayahuasca first time, he had the first genuinereligious experience of his life. Many accounts echo this. We may not even knowthe extent to which we have been disconnected from our own soul, our essence,until it is revealed to us with the help of an outside agency.Unfortunately, we live in a society that remains hyper-commodified, competitiveand ego-driven. Over time, the ego is supple enough to assimilate anything –including the drastic flights of the ayahuasca journey. With repeated use,transformative journeying becomes normalized. The exquisite revelation of theinitial communion with the medicine gets tainted, filtered through theindividual’s social perceptions and received ideology.The medicine influences people’s lives and communities, but it rarely bringsabout a complete change of state. Eventually, among the privileged, many findways to assimilate ayahuasca into their status-conscious lifestyle. In someelite enclaves, attracting the most skillful or authentic ayahuasquero to holdceremonies at your mansion or château and blow tobacco smoke over your friendsbecomes a mark of achievement equivalent to booking the best DJ for your party.Ayahuasca, in other words, has the power to influence people to some extent, butit doesn’t turn them into saints. Nor can it interrupt the exploitative flows ofglobal capitalism. Despite all of this, we believe that the rediscovery ofshamanic practices and the renewed fascination with the integral spirituality ofindigenous people presages a far deeper transition in our postmodern worldviewand paradigm. The hierarchical religious structures are breaking down and peopleare, once again, seeking gnosis for themselves. The startling rapidity of theglobal psychedelic renaissance over the last decade reveals a transformation inthe collective Psyche of humanity. Twenty years ago, it was difficult if notimpossible to imagine that ayahuasca would spread across the world as it has. Atthat point, mainstream culture and the scientific community dismissed thepsychedelic experience as irrelevant. Today, psychedelics are being embraced bya widening circle of humanity. We see new possibilities – as well as previouslyunimaginable cultural alliances – emerging from it.A new art formWith the growing interest in ayahuasca and other psychedelic substances aroundthe world, some people turn to shamanism as an attractive selfemployment option.After all, due to the still-illicit aspects of the profession in most areas,there is nothing like an agreed-upon set of standards and practices for ratingitinerant ayahuasqueros or curanderos. Stylists for fashion magazines, nightlifeimpresarios, modern dancers and DJs can launch a second – in many cases far moreinteresting, financially viable, if not quite lucrative – career as postmodernneo-shamans.A highly aesthetic and performative practice involving chants, songs, scent,altars and storytelling – as well as the embodied experience of nausea, pain,release, darkness and mystery – ayahuasca neo-shamanism has become somethingakin to a cutting-edge improvisatory art form. The Canadian scholar ElenaAndrade defines the practice of ayahuasca shamanism as “somatic poetry”. Whatshe calls the “art of ritual healing” includes:… storytelling, plant ceremonies, healing rituals. Seeing shamanism as a kind ofperformance offers a grounded approach to ayahuasca ceremonies. Realizing thatthe person conducting the ceremony is a performer and in no way an authorityfigure, spiritual or otherwise, takes away the mystique around that person. Fromwhat I’ve observed, part of the shaman’s performance is to behave as anauthority figure.Urban neo-shamanism can be considered a sub-genre of avant-garde performance artwhere plants mediate, for Andrade: “a process of textual creation that allowsthe body not just to create but to become the text.” What this means, inpractice, is that modern-day shamans, whether they know it or not, take on arole that has a theatrical dimension. And in adopting this role, which includesconveying the illusion of mastery or authority, they are doing exactly whatshamans have done through millennia.Generally, after ceremonies, first-time participants seek to remember theiridentity and recover their wits; experienced drinkers, like art critics, willreview the interactive performance. They comment on everything from the strengthof the brew to the impact that sound had on their inner experience, to the exacttiming of various percussive actions and interventions. In this sense, thepopularity of ayahuasca fits into a larger trend which has been defined as atransition from consumerism to an “experience economy”. Increasingly, thecultural elite prioritize direct experiences – sometimes memorable and intenseones, like the harsh beauty found in transformational festivals or solitaryretreats – over material goods or creature comforts.Toby and Liza, a charismatic couple in their 40s, started sitting in ceremonieswith various shamans around New York seven years ago. Both of them had beenartists, in their different ways. Toby was a club DJ, visual artist, and aboveall an impresario who created “social sculptures” in outsider spaces around thecity. His most impressive creation was an old four-storey building on theBowery, once a vaudeville theatre and bare knuckles boxing ring, that herebranded and managed for a few years. It became something like what thecritical theorist Hakim Bey dubbed a Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ), a kind ofpirate utopia where artists, directors, musicians, drug dealers and mafioso cametogether on a quest for hedonistic diversion, creative expression and narcoticintoxication. An energy healer, performance artist and singer who leads a choralgroup, Liza came from England where her father is a renowned contemporaryartist.Their first teacher was a rogue shaman, often described as a heyoka (a wordborrowed from the Lakota Native Americans meaning sacred clown or trickster) whohad never undergone training with a lineage. After a couple of years, the couplefelt a calling to serve the medicine themselves.“I was a complete, utter, heroin and cocaine addict,” Toby recalls today, hisvoice a gravelly rasp from decades of chain-smoking. The old world Tobias knewwas one of “debauchery, not mind-expansion. Nirvana. Biggie Smalls. There wasnowhere I could go where people weren’t getting their minds twisted.”His first ayahuasca ceremony was at a downtown loft with a number of rock stars.At one point that night, he saw the shaman “dimensionally shift”. He felt he hadfound something he had been looking for without knowing it:With the medicine, I felt more at home than I have my entire life. In the artworld I always felt I had to be bigger and better than I was. I was never goodenough – I was never fulfilled. Maybe I have sex with more girls. Maybe I domore cocaine. Maybe I build a bigger art installation. So when I sat in thatfirst one, and I saw this guy dimensionally shifting in the room, I experienceda different reality that was palpable. I saw there was an art to it. This got mevery excited. I found a purity I was missing.Ayahuasca called to him right away. “I was a hardcore atheist. I started goingto ceremonies. And suddenly I had this whole belief system – I started to seespirits. I had the awakening.” As a result of plant medicine, he was able toovercome his addictions to opiates, pills, cocaine and even cigarettes.Liza talks in mellifluous tones about how she learned to “follow the magic flow.Let grandmother lead you through the dark wood.” She had heard about ayahuascafor many years before she drank. During that first journey, she recalls:My mother hadn’t spoken to me in five years and I went on an astral travellingjourney. I said to her, “I accept you and forgive you and love you for who youare. I’m not trying to change you.” Two days later she called me for the firsttime in five years.The couple love to tell stories from their careers as globe-trotting neoshamans.One time, they went to Las Vegas with their teacher to hold a ceremony. Theirlocal organizer had some kind of mental breakdown and disappeared. With nothingelse to do, they wandered into an art installation, that friends had set up in aparking lot, talking to passersby. “People got magnetized by our energy,” Tobiasrecalls. “By the end of a 2 hour hangout in the parking lot, we had 15 peoplesigned up for the ceremony. We had this beautiful space set up too.”Tobias and Liza readily admit that they have not received traditional trainingwith a lineage. They believe there is a distinction between those who serve themedicine as healers and those who serve it in order to “raise consciousness”.They see themselves part of this second looser group. From their perspective,they believe the medicine chose them to be carriers of it.Soon after they started to serve, Tobias and Liza moved to the big island ofHawaii for three months where they learned how to make ayahuasca on their own,drinking it every day to become attuned to the essence of the plants. ForTobias, what he has learned from ayahuasca is: “I create my own reality.” A bitlike spacey 60s gurus, both of them now freely describe the “universe” as aholographic projection created by their individual psyches. “None of this isreal,” says Tobias, emphatically.For many purists, connected to traditional medicine lines, the idea of puttingtogether an ersatz ayahuasca ceremony with strangers you meet at an artinstallation in a Las Vegas parking lot seems like utter sacrilege. “For themedicine to work, you have to build a bond with the shaman,” says JorgesHachumak, a Qigong practitioner and vegetalista living in a community south ofIquitos. “You don’t just go to somebody with feathers on their head who shakesyour hand half an hour before the ceremony – who doesn’t know the names orstories of the people. That’s a crime what these people are doing. Of course,the spirits are not happy with that.”Instant enlightenment versus enduring commitmentWhether ayahuasca’s rapid diffusion across the world is seen as a terrible or agreat development depends on one’s point of view. For purists, of course, thatpeople try it, unprepared, in so many chaotic environments, is a catastrophe.However, others believe that the medicine itself is changing as it spirals outin many directions, extending itself rapidly, like an intrepid vine, through oururbanized contemporary world. Some believe the spirit of the medicine isactually seeking out these new syncretic and improvisational settings. It ispart of how it is exploring and interacting, and learning about our contemporaryworld, getting to know us in order to heal us.As ayahuasca gained in popularity over the past decade, the shaman became acentral figure in a new cultural landscape. Whether or not the practice existedin the same way 50 or 100 years ago – whether it bears much relationship to theindigenous cultures of the past – what we call shamanism today has evolved intoa something that is both a healing modality and a kind of performance art. Theculture around ayahuasca has developed its own lingo as well as a set oftechniques, tools, symbols and signifiers that make it immediately identifiableto those who know the scene anywhere in the world. Unfortunately or not,shamanism has become a profession with hipster cachet, displacing yoga teachersas the cutting-edge of spiritual employment.Whether in Vancouver or Tulum or Byron Bay, the contemporary neoshaman hasbecome a familiar breed. They generally wear sophisticated versions ofindigenous clothes, often in all-white cotton or linen, precisely adorned withbeaded jewellery, tribal tattoos, perhaps a jaguar’s tooth or two. Sometimesthey boast about their transformative and healing powers, or direct one towebsites full of glowing testimonials.More and more people flock to shamanic workshops – vision quests, sweat lodges,soul retrieval sessions – seeking an authentic initiation, out-of-bodyexperience, or at least a fantastic new high. For a conceptual artist, rock staror movie director to be called a “contemporary shaman” is the highest praise.Huichol sculptures and Quechua fabrics line the walls of Nob Hill mansions,Ibiza estates and elite Upper East Side homes redolent with the odour of sageand palo santo. At Burning Man, Summit, and high-priced blockchain conferencesaround the world, people share stories about their latest journeys on ayahuasca,DMT, kambo and peyote.A typical example of the new breed of contemporary neo-shaman is Shaman Z, aformer investment banker from New Jersey who gave up a job in the high sixfigures to start an ayahuasca retreat centre in Costa Rica, declaring himself anayahuasquero after a four-year apprenticeship. Dubbing himself a “weapon of massawakening”, dressed in stylish white, Shaman Z circulates between scenesterhives like SoHo House, The Assemblage, and Habitas, lulling his clients into ameditative state by playing his hand-crafted, one-ofa-kind Native American drum.“I ask you, how much of your time goes into thinking about your thoughts?” heasks his SoHo House audience – a physically beautiful crowd, artfully clad inflowing natural fabrics – rhetorically. “How much of your time goes intoreflecting on the past? In actuality all thoughts are based on the past.Therefore, how are we supposed to move forward through the mind without having adeeper sense, a deeper experience?” This is instant enlightenment packaged for awell-heeled jet-set crowd who have discovered the benefits of meditation forpeace of mind and productivity, and who at least believe in giving lip serviceto sustainability and the value of indigenous cultures and practices.It can only be better for society as a whole that a highly driven, powerful,self-confident man like Shaman Z markets himself as an enlightened mystic –seeks the illuminated path – instead of pursuing a soulless career based onmaximizing stock yields and margin calls. This, in itself, marks the changingtimes. Either way, as an anthropological phenomenon, it is fascinating to watcha subculture coalesce around a new set of ideals and values – values that havenot yet been fully realized or integrated, perhaps.The global consciousness movement is growing. Many people – among them,millennials and younger adults – yearn to find meaning in a world deprived ofit. While they are acculturated to a world of virtual screens and incessantsocial media, they sense the ecological threat looming over our future – andfear the splintering of contemporary society that current events seems toforeshadow. More and more people gravitate to traditional philosophies andancient spiritual practices, whether Ayurveda, Sufism, Tantra, Taoism, yoga orAmazonian animism.Sensing the opportunity, some contemporary Westerners seek to appropriate theglamour now associated with the figure of the ayahuasquero or shaman. Theyapprentice themselves – spend a few months or years in the jungle – then burston the scene ready to bring enlightenment to the elite at anywhere between $150to $1,500 per cup. This is one approach to contemporary neo-shamanism. Otherschoose a more humble path. After engaging with the shamanic traditions of theAmazon, they lose the desire to push themselves forward as charismaticneo-shamans or spiritual maestros. Instead, they try to protect the traditionalcultures and indigenous lineages of the Amazon.In 2016, Matteo Norzi founded the Shipibo Conibo Center, a nonprofitorganization dedicated to putting on cultural performances, hosting artwork, andconducting ethnobotanical research from a brownstone on a tree-lined street inHarlem. It is a place where two worlds meet: a prewar home with elegantmodernist furniture, white walls decorated with elaborate and colourful kenétapestries, rows of books on ethnopharmacology, mythology and traditionalShipibo ceramic effigy vessels where dead bodies were once folded and buriedunderground. Inside, a tiny TV on wheels continuously replays a video of anelder Shipibo woman dressed in ceremonial garb with long black hair. She seemsto evaluate her audience with a cool indifferent gaze, while smoking a pipe.Norzi first visited the Ucayali department of Peru, native territory of theShipibo, in 2012. He and his two friends went on a mission to drink ayahuasca.“We were mid-career artists, always trying to make it in the competitive settingof New York,” recalls Norzi, an elegant giant of a man. While in Peru, they hada chance to record the icaros of a legendary shaman. They jumped at it.With his friends and collaborators Leonor Caraballo and Abou Farman, Norzitravelled to Anaconda Cosmica, a retreat centre where gringos travelled acrossthe world to heal treatment-resistant ailments, psychical and spiritual. “Wecouldn’t believe we found a community house run by indigenous people – halfwaybetween a madhouse and a Club Med in the middle of the jungle.” They decided tomake a film about it.In a few months they flew back to the forest with their camera gear andscreenplay ready. During this time, Caraballo was diagnosed with terminal breastcancer. She spent her last months with the film crew and the Shipibo peoplelearning about their culture, plant medicine, and reality itself while creatingher last work of art.Norzi became increasingly fascinated by the way the Shipibo relate to each otheras well as outsiders. Their manner, he finds, is extraordinarily impersonalcompared with that of Europeans or Americans. Even close family members addresseach other in the third person, with no excess affection or emotional emphasis.The film tries to capture this aspect of Shipibo life, through the conversationsbetween a young curandero and his mother.“We are much more tribal than they are, ironically,” he reflected. “You know, wethink my family, my friends, my kids – with them, they have a much more open wayto relate to their family members.” While making the film, Norzi observed howwhite foreigners of European descent travelling in the Amazon tried to makeeverything – every interaction – personal. After meeting each other one or twotimes, strangers would act extremely friendly with one another. It was a habitthat revealed a whole set of cultural norms, in contrast with the Shipibo way ofbeing. He increasingly found it superficial and fake. Norzi now believes thatWesterners use this abrupt camaraderie to mask our deeper levels of insecurity.Something else troubled Norzi and Caraballo as they developed their film: thetourist industry rapidly growing around ayahuasca and plant medicine tooktraditional healers away from their villages. The exodus of healers leftindigenous communities bereft of their traditional caretakers and doctors. Theirimpact was not something that most foreigners – desperately seeking healing,visions and some kind of experience to give them a badge of authenticity – wouldeven think about. Norzi felt increasingly discomfited by modern Westernculture’s negative impact on the Shipibo world.Icaros: A Vision was released in 2016, shortly after Caraballo passed away. Thefilm centers around a young woman artist suffering from breast cancer. Shetravels to the jungle in an attempt to heal and forges an unlikely alliance withan indigenous Shipibo man who is also facing a devastating illness. The film isan elegant exploration of the magical labyrinthine landscapes that can open likean M C Escher puzzle within the mind during ayahuasca trips. The film alsosubtly gestures to the realities, contradictions and awkwardness of the emergenttourist industry developing around shamanic practices. In its wake, Norzi hasbecome a steward of Shipibo culture, helping to raise awareness about corporatepressures on their communities, and the future of their healing traditions.As Westerners integrate shamanic knowledge and healing from the Amazon, it canbe difficult to define a path with integrity. If we simply take what isbeneficial for our careers from these cultures, giving our lives a shamanistictweak, we perpetuate the painful history of exploitation and colonialism. Norzibelieves, in building a relationship with the Shipibo people, he received agreat gift. In return, he wants to see them maintain their autonomy and localculture so they have the opportunity to spread their art and values across theworld.João Amorim, a film director and the executive producer of Sesame Street inBrazil, recalls how, when he was young, he took psychedelics “for entertainment”at parties and trance festivals. For years he worked as an animator in SanFrancisco. During a camping trip in the desert with friends, he had “one verystrong mushroom trip. I became a plant. I photosynthesized. I also peed in thetent. At one point I thought I was the larvae of a butterfly trapped in thetent. I asked, ‘When can I get out?’” Many years later, when Amorim starteddrinking ayahuasca, he was finally able to “understand the message I receivedduring that mushroom trip”.A wiry man with a goatee, Amorim first drank ayahuasca in 2007, after readingDaniel’s book, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl. They worked together on thedocumentary, 2012: Time for Change, released in 2010. This was Amorim’s firstfilm as a director – and a massive undertaking on a small budget. After themovie was released in the US, Amorim decided it was time for him to move back toBrazil.Today he lives between Brasilia, where he has his office, and Alto Paraíso,where he runs a permaculture community with friends. Since returning to Brazil,Amorim has deepened his involvement with ayahuasca, first sitting with the SantoDaime and then gravitating to the local indigenous groups like the Kashinawá andAsháninka who use it traditionally. He has been working with the indigenouscommunities on issues around land rights and other areas. “We have an extremeright-wing government that is changing laws around indigenous demarcation whichwould take us back to 1988,” says Amorim. “They would take tons of land awayfrom former slaves and indigenous people.”Deeply enmeshed in the medicine world for over a decade now, Amorim recalls“some really strong ceremonies”. Once he was convinced he had died and become aghost, hovering outside of his body. He also recalls:The first time I got this feeling of unconditional love for everybody – that wasmagic. That’s when you realize, really, the answer is love. A few timesayahuasca has shown this to me. Greed, anger, ego – it’s a lack of love. Lack ofcapacity for loving, and being loved. And not romantic love, LOVE!He found his commitment to working with indigenous communities in ceremonieswhere:I don’t want to say guilt but I had a weird feeling of being of Portuguesedescent and feeling what we’ve done to these people. And my responsibility nowis to fight for them, fight for their rights. Most of what I’m doing now, apartfrom Sesame Street, is helping indigenous people. I want to show the world theknowledge they have so people understand the forest – it’s better for us to haveit standing than not.Norzi and Amorim could have, easily, declared themselves neo-shamans. Westernneo-shamans get paid considerably more for their work than indigenouspractitioners, and sometimes take clients away from them. Norzi and Amorimchose, instead, a harder and more thankless path: they dedicated themselves toserving the indigenous communities who preserve the medicine traditions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13FUTURE VISIONSCommodificationWhile ayahuasca figures in a number of recent books and movies, its mostprominent appearance went uncredited. James Cameron’s Avatar (2009) is thehighest grossing film in Hollywood history. This big-budget 3D sciencefictionepic tells the story of a magical rainforest community, the Na’vi, forced tofight to protect their exquisite yet fragile world, Pandora, against thedepredations of a militarized corporate empire determined to strip-mine theirhome to extract a precious mineral. With the help of a soldier who virtuallytransfers his consciousness to a biotechnologically engineered body that makeshim one of the community, the Na’vi defeat the empire, to live happily everafter in their forest utopia (at least until the sequel).It looks likely that Cameron may have used the ayahuasca experience asinspiration. In fact, one scene deleted from the finished film shows the Na’vidrinking a visionary potion next to the tree of life which is the heart of theirculture. The tree is called “Eywa” – uncannily close to “Aya”.The story told by the film bears more than a passing resemblance to one of theworst environmental disasters in modern history, caused by the fossil-fuelcompany Texaco, which merged with Chevron in 2000. In 1964, Texaco discoveredsubstantial oil reserves in the remote Ecuadorian Amazon. At that time, therainforest was largely unsullied and the home for a number of local communities.“The indigenous inhabitants of this pristine rainforest, including the Cofán,Siona, Secoya, Kichwa and Huaorani communities, lived traditional lifestyleslargely untouched by modern civilization,” notes the nonprofit organizationAmazon Watch. “The forests and rivers provided the physical and culturalsubsistence base for their daily survival.” Some of these communities werealmost uncontacted before the arrival of the oil company, which built a newtown, Lago Agrio, as the centre of its operations in the region.Over the next three decades, Chevron knowingly dumped 18 billion gallons oftoxic waste water and 17 million gallons of crude oil in unlined, open-air pits.In late 2018 after decades of vexatious litigation between some 30,000 localresidents demanding clean-up and Chevron, an international tribunal in The Hagueruled in favour of the polluters.Sadly, this story, unlike Avatar, lacks a fairytale ending. While some of thetraditional cultures of the region still survive, many have been ravaged. Bychanging the tragedy to a fairytale and placing the allegory far away, on adistant world, Avatar – whatever Cameron’s intentions – furthered the corporatesystem of commodified spectacle. Showcasing Hollywood’s technical mastery, thefilm worked as propaganda for Western technologies and our corporate culture,subverting the rebellious message of the fable. Avatar also stealth-marketedvirtual reality as an exciting solution, coming soon for those trapped in thegloomy matrix – our next corporate-controlled illusion of freedom.From colonialism to the rubber boom to the modern assaults of the mining andagro-business industry, the history of contact between the Amazonianayahuasca-using communities and the modern industrialized world has been brutal.Capitalism tends to exploit any resource to maximize monetary reward and thendiscards what doesn’t fit into its narrow calculus. Back in 1986, an intrepidAmerican entrepreneur named Loren Miller even claimed copyright of the geneticmaterial of Banisteriopsis caapi, which he dubbed, imaginatively, “Da Vine”. AUS patent granted Miller sole rights to “asexually reproduce” the ayahuascavine, and to sell the plant, including “any of its parts, throughout the UnitedStates”.In 1998, an Ecuador-based coalition called the Coordinating Body for IndigenousOrganizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) publicly denounced Miller forbiopiracy, calling him “an enemy of indigenous peoples”. Other US-basednonprofits joined the battle. In a somewhat theatrical gesture, a leader of theCofán community travelled from the Amazon to the US Patent and Trademark Office,decked out in traditional regalia including feathered headdress, with legaldocuments rolled in his fist. After an exhaustive legal battle, Miller’s patentexpired in 2003 without the possibility of renewal.Even after this victory, the commodification of ayahuasca remains a complex,tangled topic. As Beatriz Labate and Clancy Cavnar, the editors of The ExpandingWorld Ayahuasca Diaspora, point out, “cultural appropriation and commodificationof indigenous traditions are also highly germane as ayahuasca expands into newsectors of society”. Something continues to feel strange, disorienting, aboutthe commercial exchange of money for ceremonial medicine work, even though thishas become commonplace.Historically in the Amazon, healers would do their work for barter or as a gift.The logic of late-stage capitalism reduces whatever it encounters – no matterhow different, exotic, indigenous, transgressive or sacred it may seem at first– to mere commodities that can be exchanged on a global marketplace. It seeks todo with Amazon shamanism and the entheogenic sacraments – sentient, wise,“teacher” plants – what it does with almost everything else.Recently, an Instagram-famous haircare brand based in Los Angeles launched anayahuasca-infused hair treatment, using palo santo oil and Banisteriopsis caapi“plant essence”. The concoction apparently “helps repair damaged hair, splitends and balances out scalp irritations”. At psychedelic trance festivals inEurope, hippies in dreadlocks sell laminated ayahuasca roots designed for use ascoasters or pendants. One can even invest in AyaCoin, a cryptocurrency thatfunds the creation of new ayahuasca healing centres. Unsurprisingly, noAmazonians are listed as advisers in their white paper.Kenneth Tupper, an academic who has written extensively about the globalizationof the medicine, notes: “Ayahuasca drinking, in a number of respects, has becomea bourgeois phenomenon.” Every year, thousands of tourists travel to retreatcentres in Peru to try ayahuasca. Most of these centres are located in or nearIquitos. The websites of these centres advertise simultaneously “luxurious” and“authentic” experiences, with slideshows of beds canopied in gauzy mosquitonets, tropical flowers, local villagers and the vine. The average cost of anall-inclusive nine-day retreat is $1,500 (though more exclusive packages can bemultiples higher), not including the cost of flights to and from the Amazon. Forvisitors who prefer a DIY trip, you can buy plastic bags full of shreddedayahuasca vines, as well as the brackish brew, pre-cooked and ready-made, inCoca-Cola bottles, in the bustling Belén market of Iquitos.As new high-priced retreat centres proliferate, they sometimes use questionabletactics to promote themselves. Rythmia in Costa Rica, for example, callingitself a “life advancement center”, flaunts various celebrity endorsements andrelies on aggressive marketing to fill its high-priced beds. Rythmia’s “luxuryspiritual vacations” start at $299 a night.“How I made $100 million, lost my soul and spent a few thousand dollars to getit back” reads a testimony from Rythmia’s founder Gerard Powell. You may havelost your soul, as Powell did, by buying six homes, two airplanes, six cars anda boat. But luckily, with enough cash, you can buy your soul back. All you haveto do is fly to Rythmia and swig some enlightenment elixir while a well-paidshaman chants over you, clearing away your sins and your worries.As the popularity of ayahuasca soars, its availability remains limited, usually,to those who have access and money for all-night urban ceremonies or the leisureto fly to the Amazon for week-long retreats. “Ayahuasca tourists are primarilywhite, urban, relatively wealthy, well-educated, and spiritually eclecticoutsiders” writes Stephan Beyer in Singing to the Plants.“The experience takesplace outside of the context of a long-term involvement with the struggles ofthe indigenous community from which the shaman comes.”Through the inexorable logic of capitalism, what was once exotic or sacred canbe rendered inert, vacuous. Just one more commodity or aesthetic trope to bestuffed into consumerism’s insatiable planet-devouring maw. What was thelifeblood of a culture becomes a style; something privileged Westerners canregard with indifference, ultimately with boredom, as capitalism seeks out thenext exotic energy-source to exploit and absorb.Media critic Thomas de Zengotita has given a name to the method used by the massmedia to absorb any real alternative or threatening antidote to mass consumerculture. He calls this method “the Blob”. In Mediated (2008), Zengotita writes:What must be covered is any event or person or deed that might challenge theBlob with something like a limit, something the Blob cannot absorb, somethingthat could, in resistance or escape, become the one thing the omnitolerant Blobcannot allow, something outside it, something unmediated – something real.The Blob has won when people become indifferent and bored. This means that theshock is gone and the culture starts to look for the next big thing. Asayahuasca spreads across the world, the mass media applies tactics to nullifyits deeper meaning and message.This ongoing effort to empty out, evacuate and denigrate an experience that canbe truly profound and life-changing is evident in the titles of articles onayahuasca’s global spread. When the Hollywood Reporter calls it “hollywood’ship, heavy hallucinogen”, or Business Insider pronounces it “the latest crazeamong Silicon Valley entrepreneurs”, the snarky tone lets the reader know thatsoon there will be another craze, another trend, another drug. In the end, theyinsinuate, there is nothing unique or invaluable about this one. Ayahuascashamanism must be categorized and pigeonholed, put in banal secular categoriessuch as therapy or drug experience, to deny its more profound transformativepotential.Perhaps ayahuasca will be seamlessly absorbed into the entrepreneurial frameworkof global consumerism. “Ayahuasca – like coca, like tobacco – these medicinesfor us will also be transformed by businesses with chemicals, and turned intopoison,” Benki solemly admitted to an audience at a gathering in upstate NewYork. One can envision a near-future where ayahuasca is grown en masse inindustrial green houses across the globe, locked-in with patents on its varioustreatment modalities (if not the genetic material itself), advertised onbillboards, listed on the stock market, administered to individuals in clinicswithout ritual or ceremony. This may not seem like an immediate future, but thenagain, neither did the current cannabis industry. Could this be a possibility,and if so, is it the best possible outcome?SustainabilityJorges Hachumak discovered indigenous plant medicine traditions as a young manin Lima. He has worked to preserve them ever since. He now spends his days inthe Iquitos region where he lives with a mestizo community of fewer than 200residents rescuing and rehabilitating ocelots, raptors and tapirs. Jorges hasplanted more than 3,300 sacred plants “including about seven varieties ofayahuasca, which are not well known”.Hachumak began to doubt the benefits of ayahuasca tourism when he noticed theplants starting to disappear. “There were beautiful ayahuasca vines, not so farfrom where I live.” He chokes back tears when he remembers a majestic100-year-old vine disappear overnight – “hacked down to the roots.” He relatesthe bad treatment of the plants to the type of disconnected experiences manyforeigners have in ceremonies: “They’re completely unaware of the destructionthey are producing, and they’re not even taking the plants in the proper way,which is not like fast food,” he says. Even though successful retreat centrescreate their own farms to ensure future supply, Hachumak doesn’t like thegeneral direction, which he calls “industrial plant-taking”.TV personality and explorer Chris Kilham (known as “Medicine Hunter”) publisheda 2018 report for the American Botanical Council on ayahuasca’s sustainability.The field research took place in Pucallpa, Iquitos and the Rio Tamayas region –the major hubs of ayahuasca consumption in Peru. The report found that there is“a gold rush mentality, and [that] outside harvesters may not leave enough foreach vine to regenerate”.Today, the situation is in flux – but there could be a silver lining.Potentially, as with fair trade organic coffee or cacao, ayahuasca can providelong-term income for ethical local growers. With oversight to avoid exploitativepractices and root out bad actors, ayahuasca cultivation might provide a pathtoward a sustainable and equitable future for traditional Amazonian communities.SymbiosisThe global ayahuasca boom emerges at a time of accelerating climate change,biodiversity loss, rising temperatures, food and energy crises, authoritarianismand intensifying economic disparity around the world. A preponderance of earthscientists believe we have reached a drastic threshold as a species. Accordingto the 2018 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange, if human civilization doesn’t reduce CO2 emissions as much as 10 percent annually over the next decade, we will zoom past 2°C warmer thanpre-industrial levels in the next few decades. This will be catastrophic,causing positive feedback effects that will make Earth largely uninhabitable forhumans. We know sudden spikes in the climate can happen. In past epochs ofclimate change – such as the end of the Younger Dryas period 11,500 years ago –global temperatures shot up by 10°C within a century.Our times are so intense that they have spawned a new movement out of the UK,Extinction Rebellion, made up of thousands of mainly middle-class activists whoundertake direct actions with the purpose of getting arrested. The founder, GailBradbrook, is a professor of molecular biology and a mother. “The social modelof power says that government and institutions don’t have power – we afford thempower by our obedience to them, hence the social contract,” she told aninterviewer. “It’s time to break that. I believe our biggest responsibilityright now is to step forward in acts of peaceful civil disobedience.” ExtinctionRebellion recognizes that the prospect of our near-term self-destruction ishighly likely, even inevitable, without a massive change in our priorities andactions as a species.In these turbulent times, ayahuasca is marketed in the Global North as abotanical panacea – an elixir of personal healing and enlightenment. In fact,the messages people absorb from their first batch of ceremonies usually go farbeyond the personal: they often realize they share a direct personalresponsibility for the fate of Earth. This leads some to change their careers orinvestment portfolio. The neo-shamanic culture of the Global North continues tofocus on personal healing and self-exploration. But this is only one part of thetransformative vision that ayahuasca conveys.Among the most crucial and critically endangered ecosystems on the planet is thevast Amazon rainforest. Despite its gigantic scale and extravagant fertility,the rainforest is fragile. At the moment, we are losing an estimated sevenfootball fields of the Amazon per minute to deforestation for agrobusiness,extractive mining, logging and new settlements. If temperatures rise 2°C abovepre-industrial levels, which would happen by 2035 at current rates of CO2emissions, this will cause much of the rainforest to vanish – as much as 40 percent of it. The Amazon, as a whole, produces 20 per cent of the oxygen webreathe. Its verdant mass has a crucial effect on Earth’s climate andhydrological system. If we don’t work to defend the Amazon, it is clear that ourtenure on Earth will be over quite soon.We have reached a juncture when we must collaborate to bring our world back intoecological balance. What we need is a miracle: a transformation of ourselvesindividually, and human consciousness collectively, to bring unforeseenpossibilities into being. As it incites profound insights and sometimes causesextraordinary healing, ayahuasca also gives many people the sense – theintuitive certainty – that miracles are possible. This may be true, but time isrunning out.Ayahuasca often conveys the message that humans are not haphazardly ruining theworld. We may not know it, but we are woven into a deeper evolutionary pattern,part of a greater more comprehensive programme. As the voice of the vine toldDennis McKenna during an ayahuasca journey in which he became a water dropletundergoing photosynthesis, “You monkeys only think you’re running things!”Theoretically, beyond its power as an instrument of personal healing, ayahuascahas blossomed into a global phenomenon at this critical time because of thatgreater plan. As we face ecological catastrophe unleashed by mass consumerismand corporate globalization, we are being called upon to envision a differentfuture for ourselves on Earth. We need to dream a new dream, collectively. Wecan only do so by overcoming the hubris and arrogance that led us to believe wewere isolated in our self-consciousness, intellect and technological mastery,cut off from all other species.If we integrate its lessons and heed its warnings – if we listen to its dream –ayahuasca can help us develop a new template, a redesign, for the future of ourworld. Rather than seeking further dominance and control over the physicalworld, we ought to rediscover our symbiosis with nature. Visionary plants andpsychedelic substances catalyse our capacity to do so.The cultural critic Fredric Jameson once noted that “it is easier to imagine theend of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism”. Signature shoppingmalls and “flagship boutiques” are, Jameson pointed out, “the sacred precinctsof the last global religion: capitalist consumerism”. The hypnotizing spectacleof late-stage capitalism – the Disneyfication of the world – can be seen as autopian project, and a terrifyingly effective one.One utopian project can only be met by a different one. Jameson wonders in hisarticle “Future City” in New Left Review 21 (2003) “how to locate radicaldifference; how to jumpstart the sense of history so that it begins again totransmit feeble signals of time, of otherness, of change, of Utopia”? Confrontedwith the monoculture of corporate consumerism, converting the world to asameness that is balefully apocalyptic, he finds: “The problem to be solved isthat of breaking out of the windless present of the postmodern back into realhistorical time, and a history made by human beings.”Earlier in this book, we discussed the anthropologist GerardoReichel-Dolmatoff’s work with the Desana and other Tukano-speaking groups of thenorthwest Colombian Amazon. He found their culture thoroughly informed by theirjourneys with ayahuasca and other plant sacraments: “The importance ofhallucinatory drugs is all-pervading.” Through the drug experience, the Desanabelieve they experience another “dimension of existence”, just as valid as “ourso-called everyday reality”. Each community member learned he was part of “acomplex network of interactions”, extending to “plants, animals, as a matter offact with all biotic and nonbiotic components of the environment”. Informed bytheir ongoing journeys into other dimensions, their culture defined its basicprinciple as “cooperative behavior aimed at the conservation of ecologicalbalance”.Could the localized ethos of rainforest groups such as the Secoya, Shipibo,Achuar, Asháninka – integrating inner exploration and ecological conservation –provide crucial clues to help us reinvent our technologically advanced globalcivilization? Recalling the history of our culture’s discovery, suppression,reconsideration and now reintegration of psychedelics as tools of healing andself-knowledge, is this a prospect worth exploring? After all, our culture hasreached the point where it otherwise self-destructs, taking much of thebiosphere down with it.One senses the possibility of a dialectical reversal: as late or last-stagecapitalism inexorably seeks to absorb the psychedelic experience into itswell-oiled machine of exploitation and appropriation, could visionary plantsacraments, instead, subvert that mechanism?What if the fascination with ayahuasca as a tool for personal growth incited asimilar focus on topics like food and energy sovereignty, interculturalreciprocity and social activism? As ayahuasca practitioners heal and teach thecurious of the Global North, could these privileged participants be enlisted towork with indigenous communities and stand by them to fight ecological battles?Could drinkers be challenged to live according to the ethos of reciprocity andinterconnectivity that the medicine reveals?The ethnobotanist Glenn H Shepard studied with the Matsigenka people ofsoutheastern Peru. He reports in his essay “An Ethnobotanist Dreams ofScientists and Shamans Collaborating” (1998), printed in Jeremy Narby’s Shamansthrough Time (2014), that one day, to his surprise, one of the shamans of thecommunity gave him a little piece of opatsa, a thick paste made of concentratedtobacco and Banisteriopsis caapi. Opatsa was considered a “magical substance”and Shepard assumed it existed only in legends. According to the Matsigenka,opatsa was the stuff “that first gave ‘Blowing Spirit’ Tasorintsi, thetransformative powers needed to create the world and all its creatures”. It washorrifyingly bitter, “tasting like a mixture of unsweetened coffee powder, coaltar and Vegemite”.That night, Shepard had the longest and most vivid dream of his life. In hisdream, he returned to the Matsigenka 10 years in the future to find theircommunity transformed:Matsigenka ethnobotany had become the focus of international medical research.Doctors, chemists and botanists from around the world came and went fromresearch facilities, fashioned as neo-Mayan pyramids of gleaming white stone … Iwas taken through endless rows of greenhouses and orchards, where hundreds ofmedicinal plants were being cultivated for cutting-edge medical research:aromatic herbs, fantastic fruit trees, beautiful flowers, succulent vines.He visited “laboratories and clinics where researchers tested new drugs on humanand animal subjects. The images were lucid and vivid, in full color, with clearsounds and smells.” He was told later that he met the “guardian spirits” in hisvisions, who are “very wise and good like doctors and teachers”.From our vantage point, can we envision a conjoining of opposites or adialectical reversal: a new synthesis of shamanism and industrial society,mysticism and science – the sacred and the profane – as well as psychedelicsacraments and monotheistic religions, technology and botany, capitalism andsacred medicine? Could this melding unleash a new Utopian project, combining ahumane ecological, spiritual and social mission with a design revolution? It maysound implausible – but perhaps nothing less can bring about the transformationwe need."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXA USER MANUALAyahuasca is served in many different ways. Its legal status is also in flux.Choosing the right shaman is no easy task, considering few have undergone thearduous studies and initiations traditionally required to serve ayahuasca.However, there are some tips which can be useful for both potentiating yourceremony, and helping the integration period afterwards.Before attending any ceremonies, a prospective drinker should do their duediligence. They should enquire who is leading and organizing it, what theirintentions are, and if possible, find out what past participants say about theceremonies.Set an intentionWhy do you want to try ayahuasca? What do you hope to gain from the experience?Establish a clear understanding about what it is you are seeking to resolve orreveal in your life.Ask questionsWhen choosing a shaman to have your experience with, there are a few importantthings to keep in mind. As a rule of thumb, it’s better not to rush into theexperience. The first person who approaches you on the streets of Iquitosoffering you discounted ceremonies is probably not the person you want tofacilitate your experience. Don’t be afraid to ask the facilitator of theceremony questions about the experience and the culture. You are entitled to askthe shaman about their training. Where does the medicine come from?Who made it? Where did they train, for how long? What is their intention inserving the medicine? Dispel uncertainty about their experience and theceremony. Approach this interview process not from skepticism, but fromcuriosity. See if this is the right fit for you. If something feels off aboutthe shamans, follow your intuition: wait until the time is right.The founder of Entrepreneurs Awakening, Michael Costuros, suggests a qualifiedserver has had at least four years of apprenticeship under the guidance of nofewer than three teachers. “If they started leading public ceremonies in lessthan four years, that is a big red flag for me. Maybe a deal breaker.” You wantto be sure you’re with someone who has lots of experience, preferably more thaneight years of serving to others. Ask them if their teachers have given thempermission to lead ceremonies – this way, you’ll know if the server isrespectful of the lineage of healers. Costuros suggests looking for facilitatorswho regularly visit the Amazon and continue their diets under the supervision ofmaster shamans.As for the brew itself – you want to make sure there are no suspicious additivesin the brew. Toé (Brugmansia suaveolens) is the deal breaker here. While it’srarely used, it is the admixture of choice for shamans seeking to get a bang fortheir buck, as it potentiates the brew while also causing intense delirium andpotentially nightmarish effects.LocationIf you do decide to travel to the Amazon, we recommend to go with a plan. Do notexpect that you are welcome or it is appropriate to show up to someone’s town orvillage without an invitation or trustworthy connection! As the AyahuascaCommunity Committee of the Chacruna Institute of Psychedelic Plant Medicinesrecommends, check out the reputation and location of the centre you choose to goto. If you identify as a woman, we highly advise to consult with other women whohave attended these centres. And if you do travel to the Amazon, we recommendyou look into how you can support communities through appropriate volunteer workor donate to nonprofit organizations.Counterindications and screeningPeople who facilitate ceremonies should send you a waiver and ask you to fillout paperwork detailing your medical history. They will ask you some variationof the following questions:1 Are you taking any medication?2 Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental illness? Have you had suicidalthoughts, addiction or depression?3 Do you have any medical conditions you’re being treated for?4 Has anyone in your family been diagnosed with a mental illness?5 Have you participated in ceremonies before? With whom, in what tradition?Answer these questions honestly, to the best of your knowledge. Psychedelics ofall kinds can trigger latent psychiatric conditions, and it’s important toconsider this before entering majorly altered states of consciousness. If youhave been diagnosed with schizophrenia, clinical depression or bipolar disorder,absolutely inform the servers. Don’t lie. Sometimes high-level shamans will workwith you if you experience one of these conditions, but it is not fair forservers or the rest of the group to go uninformed. Servers and facilitatorscannot accept liability or injury, and being clear with the servers is vital forthe longevity and integrity of ayahuasca’s use beyond the Amazon.Medication wise, it’s important to inform the servers if you are taking anythingeffecting the serotonin system. This includes selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs) typically used as antidepressants (such as Zoloft or Prozac).Taking ayahuasca with these medications can cause serotonin syndrome, whichresults in tremors, sweating, diarrhoea and high body temperature, even death.It’s also unsafe to take ayahuasca with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)which are also used as antidepressants. Stop taking these medications six weeksbefore your ceremony, but make sure you consult your medical professional aboutthis. Again, be clear about what it is that you’re seeking from this experience,and make sure you are looking out for yourself and your loved ones in theprocess.The Temple of the Way of Light says:Other medications you must suspend taking are decongestants, cold medications,allergy medications, antihistamines, sedatives, tranquillizers, amphetamines(including Adderall), some hypertensive medications, sympathomimetic aminesincluding pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, carbamazepine, methylphenidate(Ritalin), macromerine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asarone/calamus,asthma inhalers and diet pills.Additionally, those suffering from chronic heart conditions, hypertension orother blood conditions should not sit in ceremonies.Avoid drinking alcohol, barbiturates, amphetamines, antipsychotics and CNS(central nervous system) depressants. When in doubt, ask.Make peaceAyahuasca tends to provoke memories and feelings about our relationships withothers. We recall relationships with people we love, or have trouble with.Unresolved feelings around these relationships can cause some discomfort duringa ceremony, so it’s better to “round off” the feeling – make contact and seekresolution to know where you stand with these people.Simplify your lifestyleIt’s likely you’ll receive a detailed list with dietary recommendations leadingup to the event. Follow it. Leading up to the ceremony, you’ll want to eliminateheavy or pungent foods from your diet for at least one week before. Thisincludes fried foods, meats, any intense spices and other foods that requirelots of metabolic energy to digest. Following a diet of fresh fruits andvegetables and grains will gradually prepare you for the ceremony bothphysically and emotionally. If possible, it’s best to abstain from consumingintense media – it can cloud thought and evoke intense reactions. Get plenty ofrest. Preparing for the ceremony beforehand is a matter of intuition – take goodcare of yourself, and be extra conscientious of what you consume.SurrenderWhen you’re at the ceremony, commit to fully participating in the experience andstaying there until it has formally concluded. Time may feel warped –interminably long, or very short. Allow yourself to surrender to the situation;turn your phone off and leave your watch at home. This is a unique opportunityto go beyond the everyday schedule, so enjoy it. If you experience discomfort inthe ceremony, remember to focus on breathing and the intention you set whenentering the space. The intention you set can be like an anchor for your psycheto keep returning to if you feel you are straying. Sometimes if you feel “inbetween”, as if you aren’t quite comfortable with the state you’re in, it mightbe good to drink another cup. However, if you at any moment feel physicallyunwell, unsafe or are being asked to do something that makes you uncomfortable –follow your intuition. We recommend sitting in ceremonies with both female andmale facilitators, and establishing a sense of trust with them before the event.IntegrateLeave your schedule open the day after to rest, reflect, journal or go forwalks. Even though the ceremony might be over, the effects of the medicine andthe insights gained are still processing. Eat some fruit, take a cold shower,and get plenty of rest. Some say they feel the effect of the medicine up to aweek afterwards. It’s the period of time immediately following the ceremonywhere the real work of unifying the vision with the reality begins. In manycities psychedelic societies are popping up. Attend a meeting if you feel likesharing and processing your experiences with a like-minded group.Additional reading and resourcesWhile we can’t give you information on where to have your experience, there aremany nonprofit organizations and publications offering integration and educationservices:International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research & Service (ICEERS)ICEERS is a nonprofit organization based in Barcelona, providing free educationrelated to psychedelic plants, in particular ayahuasca and iboga. Through theirlegal services, ICEERS is the first organization of its kind to provide aid tothose punished for the possession of ayahuasca. Psychologists working withICEERS offer online support for those having trouble integrating difficultexperiences with ayahuasca and other psychedelic plants.Chacruna Institute of Psychedelic PlantsChacruna (chacruna.net) is an organization which produces high-quality researchon plant medicines and psychedelics, offering academic knowledge in moreaccessible formats. Chacruna also creates educational material to create abetter cultural understanding of psychedelic plants. You can follow theirwebsite to stay up to date on conversations and more controversial subjectsrelated to the “mainstreaming” of psychedelics.ErowidErowid is an online vault of more than 60,000 pages of first-hand accounts andscavenged science on psychoactive drugs.Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Sciences (MAPS)Founded in 1986, the nonprofit organization MAPS has spearheaded scientificresearch into the medical benefits of psychedelic substances like MDMA, LSD andpsilocybin as well as ayahuasca and cannabis. MAPS holds conferences and eventsoften, where seasoned psychonauts or the curious engage with psychedelic cultureand the future of research. You can find a list of clinically trained therapistsready to help integrate psychedelic experiences.Drogas, Política y CulturaThis Spanish language website showcases perspectives on the globaltransformation of drug culture and psychedelic plants from the Latin Americanperspective, curated by a team of drug policy experts, anthropologists andethnographers, many of whom work closely with indigenous healers and communityleaders."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYAbram, D, The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a Morethan-HumanWorld, Vintage Books, New York, 2017Allegro, J, The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Originsof Christianity within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East, Hodder &Stoughton, London, 1970Belaunde, L, Sexualidades Amazónicas: Género, Deseos y Alteridades, La SiniestraEnsayos, Lima, 2018Berendt, J, The World Is Sound: Nada Brahma: Music and the Landscape ofConsciousness, Destiny Books, Merrimac, 1991Beyer, S, Singing to the Plants: A Guide to Mestizo Shamanism in the UpperAmazon, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 2010Burroughs, W, Naked Lunch, Penguin Books, London, 2016 Burroughs, W, andGinsberg, A, The Yage Letters, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1963Calvo, C, The Three Halves of Ino Moxo: Teachings of the Wizard of the UpperAmazon, Inner Traditions International, Rochester, 1995Dargan, P, and Wood, D, eds, Novel Psychoactive Substances: Classification,Pharmacology and Toxicology, Elsevier Academic Press, Cambridge, 2013Davis, W, One River: Explorations and Discoveries in the Amazon Rain Forest,Simon & Schuster, New York, 1997Davis, W.

That moment marked the birth of Watkins, soon to become thepublisher of many of the leading lights of spiritual literature, including Carljung, Rudolf Steiner, Alice Bailey and Chögyam Trungpa.Today, the passion at Watkins Publishing for vigorous questioning is stillresolute. Our stimulating and groundbreaking list ranges from ancient traditionsand complementary medicine to the latest ideas about personal development,holistic wellbeing and consciousness exploration. We remain at the cutting edge,committed to publishing books that change lives.DISCOVER MORE AT:www.watkinspublishing.com [http://www.watkinspublishing.com]images [images/img_08.jpg]Read our blogimages [images/img_09.jpg]Watch and listen to our authors in actionimages [images/img_10.jpg]Sign up to our mailing listWe celebrate conscious, passionate, wise and happy living.
