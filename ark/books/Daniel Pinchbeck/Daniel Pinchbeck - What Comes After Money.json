A fewleap across the Monopoly board with great gusto, building or toppling companies,gobbling up futures on resources and minerals, speculating on currencies. Somemarket new cultural products—images, memes, books, lines of software code,musical jingles—as their gambits and dice throws in the global casino. Others,dealt a worse hand, play a more brutal version of the game in the back alleys ofthird world cities, begging for baksheesh, selling their sex for a meager sum,sending their children to work in factories or collect bits of nickel andaluminum from toxic trash heaps. Simply by virtue of being born into this singleglobal system, this omni-oppressive world order, we are all conscripted into arelentless contest, a ceaseless tumult.Ever since the mangling of his ideas led to horrific dictatorships and genocidalregimes over the last century, the philosopher Karl Marx has been out offashion, neglected and suppressed. This is understandable but unfortunate, asmany of his insights into the mythic dimensions of money and the workings ofcapital deserve reconsideration. In the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of1844, Marx describes money as “the visible divinity” in our capitalist world:“By possessing the property of buying everything, by possessing the property ofappropriating all objects, money is thus the object of eminent possession. Theuniversality of its property is the omnipotence of its being. It thereforefunctions as almighty being. Money is the pimp between man’s need and theobject, between his life and his means of life. But that which mediates my lifefor me, also mediates the existence of other people for me. For me it is theother person.” Since birth, we have been trained like performing seals to acceptthe spiteful conjuror’s trick that transmutes any and all qualities intoquantities—into bigger or smaller piles of cash. Seemingly without analternative, most of us accept a system in which everything and everyone has itsprice, and beneath every celebration lies a cynical calculation.Hypnotized by our culture, most people believe that our current form of money isthe only rational way to exchange value—that a debt-based currency, detachedfrom any tangible asset, is something as organic and inevitable as carbonmolecules, ice, or photosynthesis. We forget that money, in its current form, isjust a tool. Humans created money to perform certain functions and satisfycertain needs. But just as engineers and computer programmers drop cruder,out-of-date tools and pick up better ones as soon as they become available, wemight also switch to more sophisticated instruments for transferring goods andservices that function more efficiently and equitably. We could implement newmechanisms and platforms for exchanging value that we have designed to preventthe destructive social and ecological feedback loops produced by our currentfinancial system. As an operating system for society, money needs a majorupgrade. This upgrade will not just happen on its own; we need to apply ourintelligence and creativity to make it happen.This requires an act of will, and a leap of faith, from many of us. Personally,I grew up with an artistic New York background and, until a few years ago, Inever gave much thought to economics, considering it incredibly boring, useless,and the opposite of anything cool. About five years ago, I began to comprehendthat the underlying logic of our economic system was inciting a systemiccrash—that our model of endless growth on a finite planet was bringing aboutmass species extinction, mass pollution, and was somehow linked to a nihilisticvalue system that mortgaged the future of the planet for the instantgratification of the lucky few. When we launched our web magazine RealitySandwich, we made alternative approaches to our economy one of our areas offocus, and a priority. First appearing in Reality Sandwich, the essays includedin this book present a range of perspectives on the problems endemic to ourcurrent financial system, and propose tangible ways to change it. For those whoare not used to this type of discussion, it takes a while to familiarizeyourself with the issues and the terminology, but the effort is worth it, as thesubject is of critical importance.Over the last half-century, the mainstream culture institutionalized hipsterrebellion and integrated it within the corporate mainstream, which constantlyinstructs us to “Just Do It,” “Think Different,” “FCUK,” and the like.Corporations took our innate impulse toward dissent and our desire formeaningful change, and transmuted them into effective sales tools for theirproducts. The new counterculture, which I believe Reality Sandwich represents,goes beyond easily assimilated gestures of rebellion to interrogate and analyzethe underpinnings of our current destructive social order. We believe it is nolonger enough to propose alternatives—we need to implement them, instead ofwaiting around, expecting that someone else is going to do it for us. For thisreason, along with Reality Sandwich, we launched a social network, Evolver.net[http://www.Evolver.net], which provides the organizing hub for what we call theEvolver Social Movement. The ESM brings together local communities that share avision of how society could be transformed under a global umbrella, and promotesinitiatives in permaculture, public performance, local currencies, and viablealternatives in many areas. Evolver actively seeks to collaborate with othermovements and organizations that employ DIY tactics to revitalize civil society,such as Transition Town, the Zeitgeist Movement, Iraq Veterans Against the War,Burners Without Borders, etcetera. We propose that reimagining and reinventingsociety through conscious collaboration is the avant-garde art form of our time.While rarely discussed in the mainstream media, an awakening is currentlyunderway: More and more people are coming to realize that what we use as moneyis not some natural force or omnipotent being, but a magic spell. This spell ismaintained by the oracles and high priests of finance from their well-guardedtemples—the banks and treasuries—where they alchemically transmute little bitsof paper or blips of data into valuable artifacts, using occult symbol,incantation, and numerical abracadabra. Indeed, what the financial sorcerersfear more than anything is a collective loss of faith in the abstruse and arcaneinstruments they use to bind the great human mob in invisible chains of debt,servitude, and scarcity.The political philosopher Antonio Negri demystified “capital” by defining it,simply, as a “social relation.” What does this mean? When a billionaire walksinto the room, everyone reacts as though the intangible assets circulating asdata streams in his investment portfolio are as real as the armor that TonyStark puts on when he becomes Iron Man. These streams of virtual data permit thetycoon to control servants, private security forces, mansions, yachts, Picassos,and whatnot. In actual fact, the extraordinary superpowers ascribed to such apersonage exist only in the mind.If a sudden pulse of solar radiation wiped out our hard drives, everyone wouldquickly see that stored capital was merely a cultural convention, a beliefsystem. The billionaire would lose all of his perceived superpowers and, like anincredible shrinking magnate, retract back to modest size. The vast apparatus ofcontemporary media and the sleek glass architecture of corporate skyscrapers aredesigned to reinforce unquestioning obedience and faith in this belief system ofcapitalism, which gives the privileged few the power of life and death over themultitudinous many.Antiglobalization activists often proclaim that another world is possible. Theydeclare their faith that the current, tragically unjust orchestration of capitalis not the only way we can organize our planetary community, even at our currentlevel of size and complexity. Most people find it almost impossible to imagine asystemic alternative. This seeming impossibility of envisioning and thenconstructing a viable alternative is an illusion. The corporate media constantlyimprints and indoctrinates us into the unquestioning belief that the way it isnow is the only way it can be. The system keeps our consciousness trapped withina particular set of beliefs, a certain frequency of awareness and closed framingof our reality. The media ignores the alternatives that already exist, andconstantly amps up people’s fear of losing what little they have. For those whosee beyond these prison walls, it is not enough to insist upon the possibilityof another world. We need to understand how we can construct the alternative,and then work together to bring it about.There was a time before our current monetary system existed, and there will be atime after it is gone. We can look, without sentimentality or nostalgia, at thepractices of premodern indigenous cultures that didn’t need lawyers,accountants, Swiss bank accounts, or land that could be owned. These culturesorganized themselves around gift exchange rather than financial transaction. Forindigenous people in Australia or South America, power is not something that canbe hoarded; power can only be expressed in the living present, through ceremony,initiation, and action. As anthropologist Pierre Clastres discusses in SocietyAgainst the State, the tribal chief is generally the one who owns the least, ashe gains respect by giving away everything that comes to him to maintain harmonyand balance among his people. His generosity is a source of power. Thesecultures may provide keys for us, models to make use of as we go forward,reinventing our institutions and technologies so they support long-rangeprosperity for everyone on earth.When the Thai baht suddenly ceases to function, when the Mexican peso bites thedust, these devastating traumas have nothing to do with the productivity of thelocal lands or the skills of the people. Neither their houses and farms nor themachines in their factories suddenly molt or liquefy; the abstract data flowsmanipulated by the financial elites are all that shift. For some reason, we havevested a small coterie of avaricious speculators with the ability to dismantle anation’s economy in a matter of hours, as they follow flickering tugs of fearand greed.Our current monoculture of money enforces aggressive, competitive, andunsustainable patterns of behavior by creating artificial scarcity. When you geta loan from a bank, the bank gives you the principle, but does not create theinterest. Therefore, you are forced to go out into society and compete againsteveryone else to bring back the interest that accrues. Publicly tradedcorporations, similarly, are forced to maximize profits to satisfy theirshareholders, and therefore must use the most expedient methods to createrevenue, even when this means sabotaging environmental safeguards or deprivinglocal communities of their fair share. “Free market” capitalism guarantees therewill be big winners, and bigger losers. The biggest loser, alas, is the earthitself. As long as our technological powers increase within a system ofdomination and exploitation, more catastrophes like the Gulf oil spill and theChernobyl and Bhopal disasters are essentially guaranteed. As technology becomesmore powerful, these calamities will only get more horrifying, until the rottingfoundations of our social order are exposed and addressed.Our currency is not a neutral tool, but a crystallized belief system. “Money” isan expression of ideology, the blinkered reasoning or “irrational rationality”that mortgages the present moment for a future payoff that never arrives. In theinterim, the laboring multitudes grind it out, hour by hour, day by day. As wereconsider the meaning of money and the true nature of value, our society willalso reconceive our approach to work; eventually, we will change our ideas ofwhat progress means, and even our relationship to time. Once “time” is no longer“money,” we may transform the way we choose to live in time.Many progressives and social crusaders argue that unemployment is a major socialproblem. They call for more jobs, “green jobs,” or guaranteed employment. Thisfocus on employment is also a misconception based on a limited reasoning. Inactual fact, it is not unemployment but work that is the problem. Deep down,nobody wants a job to occupy his or her time. We want a mission that inspiresus.As the design scientist Buckminster Fuller noted, most of the work that oursociety creates produces no real benefit for the earth, and in fact subtractsfrom it. Most of the work we do requires pointless expenditures of energy andmakes more waste. Rather than having people drive to jobs and use up endlessStyrofoam containers and toner cartridges, it would be cheaper—in the real termsof the vitality and thrive-ability of the earth—to subsidize them to remain intheir home communities, support them to grow their own food, foster permacultureprojects to increase biodiversity, and encourage them to educate themselves andtheir children, to make art and perform ritual if they felt so inclined, and togenerally celebrate the sacred mystery of being with a minimum of interference.Without idealizing the past, we know that many indigenous people did not “work”in the way we now understand it. Colonialists were outraged that native peoplesonly spent a few hours a day doing those activities necessary to support life,such as hunting and gathering, building their temporary habitats, and so on.While zealous application of the Protestant ethic brought the benefits ofWestern medicine and technology to the human community, it also had theunfortunate result of turning our world from a garden into a gulag.The human-devised concept that “time is money” has created a wasteland ofboredom and nihilism where many of us are forced, as the critic Lewis Mumfordcunningly observed, to look into the mirror each morning and ask ourselves whatpart of our personality we can sell today. Given such a system, some of the mostsuccessful manipulators are those natural sociopaths who feel no compunctionabout thieving from the masses to line their own pockets—think the “smartestguys in the room” from the bygone Enron days; or complacent CEOs like TonyHayward of BP, happy to attend yachting races while his company’s activitiesterminated entire undersea ecosystems; or all the “masters of the universe” notyet exposed, let alone brought to justice. Modern capitalism makes sociopathicbehavior humdrum and routine. What else can we make of a corporation likeWalmart, which takes out secret life insurance policies on its harassed andhumiliated employees, utilizing statistical “quant” analysis to cash in on theiraggravated death rates?Our current economic system is institutionalized psychopathology, a parasiticvirus, and its perpetuation would likely lead to the termination of the humanexperiment in an accelerating series of catastrophes, as climate changeaccelerates and the exploitation of resources and technological domination ofnature intensify. The alternative is extremely difficult to imagine, until werealize it. Albert Einstein once noted that a problem is never solved by thesame level of consciousness that created it, but can be superseded once a newlevel of consciousness is attained. We rapidly approach an exciting thresholdwhere breakdown and breakthrough could happen almost simultaneously.The good bad news is that we are witnessing the collapse of the currentfinancial order, a bit like watching a multi-car collision take place insickening slow motion. While vast amounts of intangible finance capital continueto amass, the real assets of the earth are in rapid decline, and this growinggap between the abstract and the real is bringing on an inevitable crash, one inwhich the delusions of finance capital can no longer be maintained. The globalsystem has revealed itself as a massive Ponzi scheme, a debt pyramid, and we arereaching that thrilling, terrifying precipice where maintaining the fiction isno longer possible.Nobody has ever been in this situation before. What happens next is anyone’sguess, but a few alternatives seem most plausible. Over the last decades, wealthhas been concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. According to a recent study,fewer than seven hundred billionaires have a combined net worth of more than $2trillion. At the same time, an estimated 2.8 billion people survive on less than$2 a day, and 1.2 billion live on less than $1. Here in the United States, fewerthan 7,500 individuals out of 300 million control “almost three-quarters of thenation’s industrial (nonfinancial) assets, almost two-thirds of all bankingassets, and more than three-quarters of all insurance assets,” notes politicalscientist Thomas Dye in Who’s Running America? Members of this small group canbe found in the top tiers of the most exclusive law firms, investment banks,federal government posts, and military commands, where they can control theherd.As the superstructure of the financial system melts down, it is unlikely thatthis small coterie of the world’s financial elite will choose, in a greatheartfelt conversion, to democratize wealth and share resources equitably. Theywill, more likely, seek to grasp onto their privilege and keep theirstranglehold over resources, potentially creating an increasingly authoritarianstate apparatus in which the divide between the haves and have-nots becomes evergreater. As social pressure builds, draconian restrictions based on trumped-upfears of terrorists, immigrants, and other bogeymen may supplant democraticfreedoms. The corporate oligarchy has spent decades mastering techniques ofgetting uninformed and ignorant people to act against their own best interests,and will continue to foster stupefaction and mob rule. As increasing constraintsare placed on us, as security forces patrol the perimeter and drone helicopterscircle overhead, as basic necessities like drinking water are sold back to us,as hyperinflation leaves only a few megabanks still standing, we will betold—over and over again—that this culture is still the greatest thing ever,that the evil others are to blame, and that it is all being done for our owngood.The other option is the one discussed, from various angles, in the essayscollected in this book: the prospect that the rapidly deepening, globallysystemic, economic-ecological collapse will provide the necessary ground for amass awakening, and for the reinvention of our economic system in accord with adesign science that follows nature’s operating principles. As the economistBernard Lietaer has noted, what we require is a shift from a fragile monoculturebased on one form of money to a diversified offering of many currency tools,providing a variety of ways for human beings to exchange value. The current formof Yang currency that supports masculine competition and aggression must becomplemented, perhaps superseded, by Yin currencies that foster collaborationand cooperation.More fundamental than any new currency is the shift in awareness, the change ofconsciousness, necessary before a truly equitable global society can emerge.This change is already occurring on many levels, some visible and somesubliminal, throughout our increasingly interconnected world. We are developinga thoroughly evolutionary perspective, one that sees human cultures,relationships, and social systems as expressions of an evolution of life and ofa consciousness that is perpetually ongoing. We are not passive observers ofthis process, but active participants. We are the coming-into-consciousness ofthe Gaian mind, and our actions and intentions—as individuals andcommunities—determine the trajectory of our future culture.From this evolutionary viewpoint, we can see the development of capitalism overthe last few hundred years as a necessary phase, but not a final endpoint,toward the inception of a planetary community. Capitalism drove technologicalinnovation and a melding of the world’s cultures, but kept us locked in anadolescent state of mind. Communications technologies such as the internet havenow linked humanity into a global tribe, able to communicate instantaneously andexperience simultaneously. The intensifying economic and ecological meltdown isakin to the process that occurs when a caterpillar morphs into a butterfly:There is, first of all, a disintegration of the caterpillar form and theemergence of imaginal cells that direct the process of transmutation into a newform of life. To the old system, this appears as danger, as death, but to thenew emergent form, it is necessary as an aspect of the birthing process.We are inexorably moving toward the realization of humanity as a unified being,a singular organism, meshed with the delicate planetary ecology that nurturesus. As Bruce Lipton and Steven Bhaerman discuss in their book SpontaneousEvolution, the cells in the human body have developed to work together inperfect symbiosis, sharing resources equitably. You don’t find one cell hoardingmasses of energy while another cell is left utterly deprived and gasping. Ifindividual humans are akin to cells in a greater Gaian organism, we couldsimilarly reach a point at which sufficient energy is provided to all, foreveryone’s benefit, to ensure the effective functioning of the whole.The essays in What Comes After Money? are thought experiments that explore ourcurrent economic predicament and reveal the path to a new economy,biospherically balanced and equitably attuned. For many people, the idea thatour global capitalist system could make a quantum jump into a new systemicparadigm will initially seem impossible and outlandish. However, human culturecan change with remarkable speed when necessary. Before 1989, among all thehighly paid think tank analysts and political specialists, nobody predicted thatthe Berlin Wall would be taken down, piece by piece, through a euphoric civilianuprising, while the military stood down—that East would reunite with Westwithout nuclear conflict or vast loss of life. This happened because, on asecret and subliminal level, the consciousness of people operating under thatold oppressive order could no longer tolerate a barricade created by ideologyand maintained through domination. Today, Wall Street and its “banksta” alliesin foreign capitals control the movements of capital and the destiny of peopleand nations. Is it possible that a civil society upsurge could tear thisconceptual barricade down as well? If something like this were to take place,the best-case scenario would be that we would have a new paradigm, a workingoperating system for exchanging goods and services using different principles,ready for rollout before social chaos could lead to the imposing ofauthoritarian controls.Personally, I agree with the visionary thinker José Argüelles, who proposes thattime is not money: time is art. The next phase of human development should beone of conscious evolution and co-creative collaboration, when we recognize thatsociety is, in itself, an art project. We have the power to use our intelligenceand imagination to reinvent society’s operating system so that it fulfillshumanity’s highest hopes and age-old aspirations. If we can develop andconstruct a new economic foundation that strikes a balance between the giftexchanges of the archaic past and our modern system of swift globaltransactions, we might manifest a magnificent art project, an ever-evolvingsocial sculpture, together. Such an expression of our collective human geniuswill benefit our kin and our descendants, and support the greater web of life.Facing a crisis unleashed by human greed and ignorance, we have an extraordinaryopportunity to bring about a new—or renewed—society that is far morecomfortable, harmonic, relaxed, peaceful, and humane. My hope is that this bookoffers a set of helpful tools for thinking through this extraordinary process,and that it inspires you to collaborate on the great co-creative experiment thatlies ahead."},{"pageContent":"1MONEY AND THE CRISIS OF CIVILIZATIONCHARLES EISENSTEINSuppose you give me a million dollars with the instructions, “Invest thisprofitably, and I’ll pay you well.” I’m a sharp dresser—why not? So I go outonto the street and hand out stacks of bills to random passersby: ten thousanddollars each. In return, each scribbles out an IOU for twenty thousand dollars,payable in five years. I come back to you and say, “Look at these IOUs! I havegenerated a 20 percent annual return on your investment.” You are very pleased,and pay me an enormous commission.Now I’ve got a big stack of IOUs, so I use these “assets” as collateral toborrow even more money, which I lend out to even more people, or sell them toothers like myself who do the same. I also buy insurance to cover me in case theborrowers default—and I pay for it with those selfsame IOUs! Round and round itgoes, each new loan becoming somebody’s asset against which to borrow yet moremoney. We all rake in huge commissions and bonuses, as the total face value ofall the assets we’ve created from that initial million dollars is now fiftytimes that.Then one day, the first batch of IOUs comes due. But guess what? The person whoscribbled his name on the IOU can’t pay me back right now. In fact, lots of theborrowers can’t. I try to hush up this embarrassing fact as long as possible,but pretty soon you get suspicious. You want your million-plus dollars back—incash. I try to sell the IOUs and their derivatives that I hold, but everyoneelse is suspicious too, and no one buys them. The insurance company tries tocover my losses, but it can only do so by selling the IOUs I gave it.So finally, the government steps in and buys the IOUs, bailing out the insurancecompany and everyone else holding the IOUs and the derivatives stacked on them.Their total value is way more than a million dollars now. I and my fellowentrepreneurs retire with our lucre. Everyone else pays for it.This is the first level of what has happened in the financial industry over thepast decade. It is a huge transfer of wealth to the financial elite, to befunded by U.S. taxpayers, foreign corporations and governments, and ultimatelythe foreign workers who subsidize U.S. debt indirectly via the lower purchasingpower of their wages. However, to see the current crisis as merely the result ofa big con is to miss its true significance.I think we all sense that we are nearing the end of an era. On the mostsuperficial level, it is the era of unregulated casino-style financialmanipulation that is ending. But the recent efforts of the political elites tofix the crisis at this level only reveal its deeper dimensions. In fact, thecrisis goes all the way to the bottom. It arises from the very nature of moneyand property in the world today, and it will persist and continue to intensifyuntil money itself is transformed. A process centuries in the making is in itsfinal stages of unfoldment.Money as we know it today has crisis and collapse built into its basic design.That is because money seeks interest, bears interest, and indeed is born ofinterest. To see how this works, let’s go back to some finance basics. Money iscreated when somebody takes out a loan from a bank (or more recently, adisguised loan from some other kind of institution). A debt is a promise to paymoney in the future in order to buy something today; in other words, borrowingmoney is a form of delayed trading. I receive something now (bought with themoney I borrowed) and agree to give something in the future (a good or servicewhich I will sell for the money to pay back the debt). A bank or any otherlender will ordinarily only agree to lend you money if there is a reasonableexpectation you will pay it back—in other words, if there is a reasonableexpectation you will produce goods or services of equivalent value. This“reasonable expectation” can be guaranteed in the form of collateral, or it canbe encoded in one’s credit rating.Any time you use money, you are essentially guaranteeing, “I have performed aservice or provided a good of equivalent value to the one I am buying.” If themoney is borrowed money, you are saying that you will provide an equivalent goodor service in the future.Now enters interest. What motivates a bank to lend anyone money in the firstplace? It is interest. Interest drives the creation of money today. Any timemoney is created through debt, a need to create even more money in the future isalso created. The amount of money must grow over time, which means that thevolume of goods and services must grow over time as well.If the volume of money grows faster than the volume of goods and services, theresult is inflation. If it grows more slowly—for example through a slowdown inlending—the result is bankruptcies, recession, or deflation. The government canincrease or decrease the supply of money in several ways. First, it can createmoney by borrowing it from the central bank, or in the United States, from theFederal Reserve. This money ends up as bank deposits, which in turn give banksmore margin reserves on which to extend loans. You see, a bank’s capacity tocreate money is limited by margin reserve requirements. Typically, a bank musthold cash (or central bank deposits) equal to about 10 percent of its totalcustomer deposits. The other 90 percent it can loan out, thus creating newmoney. This money ends up back in a bank as deposits, allowing another 81percent of it (90 percent of 90 percent) to be lent out again. In this way, eachdollar of initial deposits ends up as nine dollars of new money. Governmentspending of money borrowed from the central bank acts a seed for new moneycreation. (Of course, this depends on banks’ willingness to lend. Since 2008,banks have hoarded excess reserves, so that repeated injections of governmentmoney have had little effect.)Another way to increase the money supply is to lower margin reserverequirements. In practice this is rarely done, at least directly. However, inthe recent past, various kinds of nonbank lending skirted the margin reserverequirement, through the alphabet soup of financial instruments that haunted thenews and the public imagination during the 2008 financial crisis. The result isthat each dollar of original equity is leveraged not to nine times its originalvalue, as in traditional banking, but to seventy times or even more. This allowsreturns on investment far beyond the 5 percent or so available from traditionalbanking, along with “compensation” packages beyond the dreams of avarice.Each new dollar that is created comes with a new dollar of debt—more than adollar of debt, because of interest. The debt is eventually redeemed either withgoods and services, or with more borrowed money, which in turn can be redeemedwith yet more borrowed money … but eventually it will be used to buy goods andservices. The interest has to come from somewhere. Borrowing more money to makethe interest payments on an existing loan merely postpones the day of reckoningby deferring the need to create new goods and services.The whole system of interest-bearing money works fine as long as the volume ofgoods and services exchanged for money keeps growing. The crisis we saw in 2008was in part because new money was created much faster than goods and serviceswere, and much faster than has been historically sustainable. There are only twoways out of such a situation: inflation and defaults. The rescue packages thatfollowed the crisis basically came down to an attempt to prevent both.Superficially successful, actually they only kicked the problem into the future.The mortgage-backed securities were bailed out and morphed into sovereign debt,and more and more of society’s wealth concentrated in the hands of thecreditors, as is inevitable when interest rates exceed economic growth.There was a much deeper crisis at work as well, a crisis in the creation ofgoods and services that underlie money to begin with, and it was this crisisthat gave birth to the real estate bubble everyone blamed for the 2008 crisis.To understand it, let’s get clear on what constitutes a good or a service. Ineconomics, these terms refer to something that is exchanged for money. If Ibabysit your children for free, economists don’t count it as a service. Itcannot be used to pay a financial debt: I cannot go to the supermarket and say,“I watched my neighbor’s kids this morning, so please give me food.” But if Iopen a day care center and charge you money, I have created a service. Grossdomestic product (GDP) rises and, according to economists, society has becomewealthier.The same is true if I cut down a forest and sell the timber. While it is stillstanding and inaccessible, it is not a good. It only becomes a good when I builda logging road, hire labor, cut it down, and transport it to a buyer. I converta forest to timber, a commodity, and GDP goes up. Similarly, if I create a newsong and share it for free, GDP does not go up and society is not consideredwealthier, but if I copyright it and sell it, it becomes a good. Or I can find atraditional society that uses herbs and shamanic techniques for healing, destroytheir culture and make them dependent on pharmaceutical medicine which they mustpurchase, evict them from their land so they cannot be subsistence farmers andmust buy food, clear the land and hire them on a banana plantation—and I havemade the world richer. I have brought various functions, relationships, andnatural resources into the realm of money. In The Ascent of Humanity I describethis process in depth: the conversion of social capital, natural capital,cultural capital, and spiritual capital into money.Essentially, for the economy to continue growing and for the (interest-based)money system to remain viable, more and more of nature-and-human relationshipmust be monetized. For example, thirty years ago most meals were prepared athome; today some two-thirds are prepared outside the home, in restaurants orsupermarket delis. A once unpaid function, cooking, has become a service. And weare the richer for it. Right?Another major engine of economic growth over the last three decades, child care,has also made us richer. We are now relieved of the burden of caring for our ownchildren. We pay experts instead, who can do it much more efficiently. Even ifwe don’t want to become “richer” in this way, the destruction of socialstructures like tight-knit neighborhoods and extended families gives most peoplelittle alternative. Community has been converted to a paid service.In ancient times entertainment was also a free, participatory function. Everyoneplayed an instrument, sang, participated in drama. Even seventy-five years agoin the United States, every small town had its own marching band and baseballteam. Now we pay for those services. The economy has grown. Hooray.The crisis we are facing today arises from the fact that there is almost no moresocial, cultural, natural, and spiritual capital left to convert into money.Centuries—millennia—of near-continuous money creation have left us so destitutethat we have nothing left to sell. Our forests are damaged beyond repair, oursoil depleted and washed into the sea, our fisheries fished out, therejuvenating capacity of the earth to recycle our waste saturated. Our culturaltreasury of songs and stories, images and icons, has been looted andcopyrighted. Any clever phrase you can think of is already a trademarked slogan.Our very human relationships and abilities have been taken away from us and soldback, so that we are now dependent on strangers, and therefore on money, forthings few humans ever paid for until recently: food, shelter, clothing,entertainment, child care, cooking. Life itself has become a consumer item.Today we sell away the last vestiges of our divine bequeathment: our health, thebiosphere and genome, even our own minds. This is the process that isculminating in our age. It is almost complete, especially in the United Statesand the “developed” world. In the developing world there still remain people wholive substantially in gift cultures, where natural and social wealth is not yetthe subject of property. Globalization is the process of stripping away theseassets, to feed the money machine’s insatiable, existential need to grow. Yetthis strip-mining of other lands is running up against its limits too, bothbecause there is almost nothing left to take, and because of growing pockets ofeffective resistance.The result is that the supply of money—and the corresponding volume of debt—hasfor several decades outstripped the production of goods and services that itpromises. It is deeply related to the classic problem of oversupply incapitalist economics. The Marxian crisis of capital can be deferred into thefuture as long as new, high-profit industries and markets can be developed tocompensate for the vicious circle of falling profits, falling wages, depressedconsumption, and overproduction in mature industries. The continuation ofcapitalism as we know it depends on an infinite supply of these new industries,which essentially must convert infinite new realms of social, natural, cultural,and spiritual capital into money. The problem is, these resources are finite,and the closer they come to exhaustion, the more painful their extractionbecomes. Therefore, contemporaneous with the financial crisis we have anecological crisis and a health crisis. They are intimately interlinked. Wecannot convert much more of the earth into money, or much more of our healthinto money, before the basis of life itself is threatened.Faced with the exhaustion of the nonmonetized commonwealth that it consumes,financial capital has tried to delay the inevitable by cannibalizing itself. Thedot-com bubble of the late ’90s showed that the productive economy could notlonger keep up with the growth of money. Lots of excess money was running aroundfrantically, searching for a place where the promise of deferred goods andservices could be redeemed. So, to postpone the inevitable crash, the Fedslashed interest rates and loosened monetary policy to allow old debts to berepaid with new debts (rather than real goods and services). The new financialgoods and services that arose were phony, artifacts of deceptive accounting on avast, systemic scale.Various pundits have observed that the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme was not sodifferent from the financial industry’s pyramid of mortgaged-based derivativesand other instruments, which themselves formed a bubble that, like Madoff’s,could only sustain itself through an unceasing, indeed exponentially growing,influx of new money. As such, it is a symbol of our times—and even more thanpeople suppose. It is not only the Wall Street casino economy that is anunsustainable pyramid scheme. The larger economic system, based as it is on theeternal conversion of a finite commonwealth into money, is unsustainable aswell. It is like a bonfire that must burn higher and higher, to the exhaustionof all available fuel. Just as fire breaks existing chemical bonds and freesheat, so does our economy break the bonds of community, nature, and culture,liberating free energy—called money—in the process. Only a fool would think thata fire can burn ever higher when the supply of fuel is finite. To extend themetaphor, the recent deindustrialization and financialization of the economyamounts to using the heat to create more fuel. It says, “We will use more money,rather than goods and services, to redeem the promise of money.” According tothe second law of thermodynamics, the amount created is always less than theamount expended to create it. Obviously, the practice of borrowing new money topay the principal and interest of old debts cannot last very long, but that iswhat the economy as a whole has done for ten years now.Yet even abandoning this folly, we still must face the depletion of fuel(remember, I mean not literal energy sources, but any bond of nature or culturethat can be turned into a commodity). Most of the proposals for addressing thepresent economic crisis amount to finding more fuel. Whether it is drilling moreoil wells, paving over more green space, or spurring consumer spending, the goalis to reignite economic growth: that is to expand the realm of goods andservices. It means finding new things for which we can pay. Today, unimaginablyto our forebears, we pay even for our water and our songs. What else is left toconvert into money?A collapse is coming, unavoidably; indeed, we are in the midst of it. The firstgovernment response to the 2008 crisis, the bailout, was an attempt to uphold atower of money that is far beyond the total value of real goods and services itpromises to redeem. Unless economic growth brings us more new goods andservices, this measure can only delay the inevitable. That is what economicstimulus, such as Obama’s 2009 package, is designed to do. But it too is doomedto fail—for a different and much deeper reason. It will fail because we aremaxed out: maxed out on nature’s capacity to receive our wastes withoutdestroying the ecological basis of civilization; maxed out on society’s abilityto withstand any more loss of community and connection; maxed out on ourforests’ ability to withstand more clear-cuts; maxed out on the human body’scapacity to stay viable in a depleted, toxic world. That we are also maxed outon our credit only reflects that we have nothing left to convert into money. Dowe really need more roads and bridges? Can we sustain more of them, and more ofthe industrial economy that goes along? Government stimulus programs will atbest prolong the current economic system for a few more years, with perhaps abrief period of tepid growth as we complete the pillage of nature, spirit, body,and culture. When these vestiges of the commonwealth are gone, then nothing willbe able to stop an economic collapse on a global scale.The persistent economic crisis of recent years is actually the final stage ofwhat began in the 1930s. Successive solutions to the fundamental problem ofkeeping pace with money that expands with the rate of interest have beenapplied, and exhausted. The first effective solution was war, a state that hasbeen permanent since 1940. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, nuclear weaponsand a shift in human consciousness have limited the solution of endless militaryescalation. Other solutions—globalization, technology-enabled development of newgoods and services to replace human functions never before commoditized,technology-enabled plunder of natural resources once off limits, and finallyfinancial auto-cannibalism—have similarly run their course. Unless there arerealms of wealth I have not considered, and new depths of poverty, misery, andalienation to which we might plunge, the inevitable cannot be delayed muchlonger.In the face of an impending crisis, people often ask what they can do to protectthemselves. “Buy gold? Stockpile canned goods? Build a fortified compound in aremote area? What should I do?” I would like to suggest a different kind ofquestion: “What is the most beautiful thing I can do?” You see, the gatheringcrisis presents a tremendous opportunity. Deflation, the destruction of money,is only a categorical evil if the creation of money is a categorical good.However, you can see from the examples I have given that the creation of moneyhas in many ways impoverished us all. Conversely, the destruction of money hasthe potential to enrich us. It offers the opportunity to reclaim parts of thelost commonwealth from the realm of money and property.We actually see this happening every time there is an economic recession. Peoplecan no longer pay for various goods and services, and have to rely on friendsand neighbors instead. Where there is no money to facilitate transactions, gifteconomies reemerge and new kinds of money are created. Ordinarily, though,people and institutions fight tooth and nail to prevent that from happening. Thehabitual first response to economic crisis is to make and keep more money—toaccelerate the conversion of anything you can into money. On a systemic level,the debt surge is generating enormous pressure to extend the commodification ofthe commonwealth. We can see this happening with the calls to drill for oil inAlaska, commence deep-sea drilling, and so on. The time is here, though, for thereverse process to begin in earnest—to remove things from the realm of goods andservices, and return them to the realm of gifts, reciprocity, self-sufficiency,and community sharing. Note well: This is going to happen anyway in the wake ofa currency collapse, as people lose their jobs or become too poor to buy things.People will help each other and real communities will reemerge.In the meantime, anything we do to protect some natural or social resource fromconversion into money will both hasten the collapse and mitigate its severity.Any forest you save from development, any road you stop, any cooperativeplaygroup you establish; anyone you teach to heal himself, or to build her ownhouse, cook his own food, make her own clothes; any wealth you create or add tothe public domain; anything you render off-limits to the world-devouringMachine, will help shorten the Machine’s lifespan. Think of it this way: if youalready do not depend on money for some portion of life’s necessities andpleasures, then the collapse of money will pose much less of a harsh transitionfor you. The same applies to the social level. Any network or community orsocial institution that is not a vehicle for the conversion of life into moneywill sustain and enrich life after money.There exist today, in theory and increasingly in practice, alternative moneysystems, based on mutual credit and demurrage, that do not drive the conversionof all that is good, true, and beautiful into money. These enact a fundamentallydifferent human identity, a fundamentally different sense of self, from whatdominates today. No more will it be true that more for me is less for you. On apersonal level, the deepest possible revolution we can enact is a revolution inour sense of self, in our identity. The discrete and separate self of Descartesand Adam Smith has run its course and is becoming obsolete. We are realizing ourown inseparateness, from each other and from the totality of all life. Interestbelies this union, for it seeks growth of the separate self at the expense ofsomething external, something other. Many in the West are now coming to agreewith the principles of interconnectedness, whether from a Buddhistic or anecological perspective. The time has come to live it. It is time to enter thespirit of the gift, which embodies the felt understanding of nonseparation. Itis becoming abundantly obvious that less for you (in all its dimensions) is alsoless for me. The ideology of perpetual gain has brought us to a state of povertyso destitute that we are gasping for air. That ideology, and the civilizationbuilt upon it, is what is collapsing today.Individually and collectively, anything we do to resist or postpone the collapsewill only make it worse. Let us stop resisting the revolution in humanbeingness. If we want to survive the multiple crises unfolding today, let us notseek to survive them. That is the mindset of separation; that is resistance, aclinging to a dying past. Instead, let us shift our perspective toward reunion,and think in terms of what we can give. What can we each contribute to a morebeautiful world? That is our only responsibility and our only security.More concretely, let us engage in conscious, purposeful money destruction inplace of the unconscious destruction of money that happens in a collapsingeconomy. If you still have money to invest, invest it in enterprises thatexplicitly seek to build community, protect nature, and preserve the culturalcommonwealth. Expect a zero or negative financial return on your investment—thatis a good sign that you are not unintentionally converting even more of theworld to money. Whether or not you have money to invest, you can also reclaimwhat was sold away by taking steps out of the money economy. Anything you learnto do for yourself or for other people, without paying for it; any utilizationof recycled or discarded materials; anything you make instead of buy, giveinstead of sell; any new skill or new song or new art you teach yourself oranother, will reduce the dominion of money and grow a gift economy to sustain usthrough the coming transition. The world of the gift, echoing primitive giftsocieties, the web of ecology, and the spiritual teachings of the ages, is nighupon us. It tugs on our heartstrings and awakens our generosity. Shall we heedits call, before the remainder of earth’s beauty is consumed?"},{"pageContent":"2THE CAPITAL IS PERSONALANYA KAMENETZI was talking on the phone to a friend about the plight of unhappily singlewomen in New York. “They just don’t give themselves the right value in thedating market,” I said. “Hey, we were just talking about the banking crisis.Look how these capitalist phrases have taken over our language!” he replied.“You’re right. I shouldn’t use these bankrupt expressions.” We both laughed whenwe realized I had inadvertently repeated my mistake.As my friend pointed out, capitalism has colonized our words, our identities,and our minds. The habit of thinking of people, ideas, and relationships ascommodities has been pervasive. We are collectively guilty of extremereification—treating the abstraction of money as if it were the only real thing.We have constructed an idol out of our own adornments—pulling our very teeth todo it—and in the process subjected our innate divinity to the inert form.And then, in late 2008, American-style free market capitalism, the singledominant human system of the last century or so, underwent a bloodless, swift,and absolute coup. The king was dead. The golden calf had been melted back downinto dross. This event would be even harder to believe if the exact same thinghadn’t happened to capitalism’s doppelganger, totalitarian socialism, just adecade before. This time, we didn’t topple any walls or statues, but a set ofpowerful illusions fell nevertheless. The crisis will take time to fully beabsorbed into our culture.What illusions have sustained capitalism, and what has been the consequence? Ourdemocratically elected leaders, with the collaboration of thousands of businessoligarchs and wealthy financiers, have refused to put our country’s vastresources to use to feed the hungry, lift up the destitute, provide care to thesick, or protect the planet from degradation—even now that it’s widelyacknowledged that the future of the species is at stake. The argument was alwaysthat “the market,” with its unique capacity to produce “economic growth,” wastoo sacrosanct to be subject to the “distortions” of government intervention,whether in the form of taxes or regulation. No human need or desire was deemedas important as the interests of the market: not the survival of innocentchildren and not the health of the air we breathe.But when the market itself was in danger of collapse, Congress acted withindays, authorizing taking $700 billion in bad debt off the hands of troubledbanks and investment firms. This desperate rescue operation exposed marketfundamentalism as just another form of false, extremist religion. When banks,financial institutions, and corporations failed, the power to respond restedwith the United States government. Clearly, then, government intervention is notdetrimental to the market. Government intervention makes the market possible.Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber writes about the history of systems ofvalue within different cultures. In Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value,he summarizes the views of Hungarian economist Karl Polanyi thus: “The state andits coercive powers had everything to do with the creation of what we now knowas ‘the market’—based as it is on institutions such as private property,national currencies, legal contracts, credit markets.… ‘Market behavior’ wouldbe impossible without police.”Legal scholar Cass Sunstein makes a related point in his book The Second Bill ofRights: FDR’s Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More Than Ever. He pointsout that our Constitution happens to guarantee the right to the abstraction ofprivate property, but not the right to the necessities of life such as food,clothing, or shelter. That means that the police are empowered to cast outsomeone who is hiding from the rain, if the roof he or she is huddling underhappens to technically “belong” to someone else. The choice to defend oneprinciple over the other is not always in line with our acknowledged moralvalues, as in the case of the starving man who steals a loaf of bread. (In thetime of the New Deal, Sunstein argues, FDR identified “Freedom from Want” as anew American right, and created new social institutions to try to protect it,but failed to enshrine it in the Constitution—thus, an unfinished revolution.)The relationship between markets and government coercion may be felt most keenlywhen it comes to the institution of debt. Graeber points out the inextricablehistorical link between debt, violence, and enslavement. In eighth-centuryGermanic law, the concept of wergild replaced the older, biblical idea of “aneye for an eye.” Wergild translates as “man” (wer, as in werewolf) plus “gold”(gild). Wergild was the substitution of a fixed sum of money or some othersubstance of value to compensate for a death, whether murder or accidental. Onone hand, the payment of blood money was a moral advance because it stopped acycle of violence. On the other hand, it was a step down the path of reducing ahuman life to a sum of money and an exchange delineated and enforced by courtsand governments. Besides blood debts, some of the earliest debts were alsocalculated as terms of indentured servitude. And everywhere and always debt hastended to be wielded by the rich and powerful over the poor and powerless, fromthe “company store” at a mining camp on America’s frontier, to the paydaylending and pawnshops that fill low-income neighborhoods today, to the massivedebts imposed as “aid” on the world’s poorest countries by the InternationalMonetary Fund.It’s no coincidence that the enormous increase in debt, the most coercive andoppressive of market institutions, caused the recent financial crisis. Theamount of consumer debt doubled between 1997 and 2007. For those who wanted toparticipate in the so-called American dream—a house, a car, a college educationfor one’s children, and an ever-increasing array of material comforts—theubiquitous result was a pile of student loan, credit card, and mortgage debt.This house of cards collapsed when people who had higher and higher debt andflat incomes could no longer keep up the payments.Indebted people tend to be submissive and restricted in their choices, notstrong and free citizens. Soon after the 2008 financial crisis, Graeber wrote:“What is debt, after all, but imaginary money whose value can only be realizedin the future: future profits, the proceeds of the exploitation of workers notyet born. Finance capital in turn is the buying and selling of these imaginaryfuture profits.… Freedom has become the right to share in the proceeds of one’sown permanent enslavement.” But I believe freedom is not so fragile or limitedas all that. The state, like the market, is nothing more than a human creation.And as human creations, they ought to be within our collective power totransform. The bursting of the debt bubble has provided a once-in-a-lifetimeopening to begin.Consider the ongoing interventions by the Federal Reserve and the TreasuryDepartment to keep interest rates low and try to encourage recovery. By whatmechanism is the U.S. government able to set interest rates and control themoney supply? Because it issues Treasury bonds backed with the “full faith andcredit” of the U.S. government. What backs that full faith and credit? To put itanother way, why do buyers of Treasury bonds believe that they’ll get theirmoney back within ten, twenty, or fifty years? Because of the long-term socialstability of our nation, as partially guaranteed by our powerful military. Andwho’s to say that our military will remain powerful and our nation stable? Tothe extent that we do believe it, this is ensured in turn by the continuingfaithful contributions of the U.S. taxpayer—generations of average peopleworking for a living and cooperating with their obligations. Our time, theconnections holding together the American community—it is not an exaggeration tosay our love—is what ultimately backs up the greenback.Over the long term, human relationships ultimately control the market, and overthe short term, human emotions do the same thing. In early 2009, a collegefriend of mine was in town for business, so we invited her to stop by fordinner. She revealed that since I had last seen her almost a year ago, she hadgone from doing international aid work in Afghanistan to working as the specialassistant to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. She told us that as she sat inmeetings with the Nobel Prize winners and the financial mandarins, the foremostfactor in the minds of the elite group managing America’s way out of thefinancial crisis is nothing less than the esoteric phenomenon of collectiveconsciousness. “The most important thing is to avoid a market panic,” she said.“It’s all about the state of people’s minds—captured in phrases like ‘consumerconfidence.’ ”So, even in the world’s most developed and sophisticated market economy, it isultimately human emotions and relationships that hold sway, not some abstractcoercive power of the state. Markets exist because of people, not the other wayaround; the economy exists to fulfill human needs and serve human desires. Thismay be a truism, but we don’t act as if we really believe it. When we put thesanctity of the “free market” ahead of human freedom and social relations, as wecan see everywhere we look, we’re falling prey to a fallacy. The same failinghappens in our personal lives when we act more directly and more often asconsumers or producers than as citizens and family members, or when like thewoman on the dating “market,” we submit ourselves and others to commodification.So now that the abject and pathetic nature of the commodification fallacy hasbeen conclusively demonstrated, it is up to us as the participants in, fools of,and creators of this ongoing illusion to carefully examine our words and ouractions for signs of error, to try to make whole what has been broken, and toembark on a new way of living.Here are three contemporary models for how to do that: * In Judaism, this process is prescribed annually and is called teshuvah—translated as repentance, it literally means return, as to a native state of wholeness and holiness. * In the addiction recovery movement, four of the famous twelve steps consist in performing a “searching and fearless moral inventory” and in making amends to those we have wronged. * And for nations that have undergone a severe collective trauma such as civil war, apartheid, or genocide, a truth and reconciliation commission attempts to accomplish a similar task by drawing testimony from the oppressors and the oppressed.What would truth, reconciliation, repentance, and amends look like for themarket system? First of all, it is incumbent upon each of us to look within ourown words and actions. I can’t blame an outside force such as “the corporations”or “the bankers” when I act greedy or when I objectify another human being witha glance or a word. We have to hold each other and ourselves accountable.Second, it is appropriate for us all to engage in mourning and symbolicexpressions of regret for the degree to which we have allowed the market tousurp our humanity. The Homo economicus model of human behavior is false andlimited. Whether we are working, borrowing, buying, or selling, we are alsothinking, breathing, loving, and hating. When we do things just for the money,we feel sick and greedy and fake because we are contributing to the oppressiveubiquity of the market.Finally, now that we have been forced to recognize that the economy is a humancreation, we should be re-empowered and freed to imagine an alternative to theoppression of market fundamentalism—to remake a system that serves humanity.To do so, we could look outside mainstream Western culture at the way othersocieties and subcultures are organized. In Toward an Anthropological Theory ofValue, Graeber writes, “In most societies, [market] institutions did not exist.…one has to … examine the actual process through which the society providesitself with food, shelter, and other material goods, bearing in mind that thisprocess is entirely embedded in society and not a sphere of activity that can bedistinguished from, say, politics, kinship, or religion.”A famous example of a society without a market is the potlatch cultures of theNative Americans of the Pacific Northwest. To simplify, say there are two clans.One fishes on the seashore and one hunts inland. When the fish are running, thefirst clan catches more than it can eat, and feasts the second. When the buffaloare running, the second clan returns the favor. In this way, both clans eatyear-round, strengthen their social ties, celebrate, worship, and make peace.Redistribution of resources happens across time and across social hierarchies aswell. For chieftains, skilled hunters, and anyone who manages to accumulateexcess, the best way to raise their social standing in a potlatch society is toshare their wealth and display generosity. This way, everyone shares andeveryone eats without the need for a formal market or redistributive taxation.If you need a less exoticized example of an alternative economy than a NativeAmerican tribe, consider the “reputation economies” of the internet. Wikipedia,YouTube, and open-source software projects like Mozilla are valuable commonresources. The platform—servers for storage and networks for transmission—mustbe subsidized by advertising or donations. But the highly valuable content iscreated, sustained, and used by people for free. Why do we do it? The phrase“reputation economy” suggests that we do it to raise our social standing, butreally it’s more than that. I do it and I think other people do too because itfeels good to create, to connect, to make the world a better place, and to berecognized for doing so.So to make amends in the wake of the financial crisis, the path is towardhealing the separation between our “economics” and our politics, our morality,our friendships, our earth, our family, and our spirituality. Rather thanattempt to destroy or abolish the formal market, we can enrich it by bringingmore of ourselves to it. We can think in terms of creating alternative forms ofexchange and integrating our other human values along with economicvalue—putting our money where our heart is. For example, you can look for workthat expresses your creativity or makes the world a better place. Even if ourjobs are less than ideal, most people can still find opportunities to expresstheir highest values at work like honesty, integrity, and kindness. You canconsume mindfully—buy well-crafted, meaningful objects that connect you to otherpeople, to the earth, and to your local community. You can reduce yourconsumption in order to avoid the perpetuation of enslavement in the form ofdebt. You can invest your money in socially responsible businesses and projectsthat help society. You can attempt to fulfill more of your material needsoutside the formal market and thus reduce its impact on your life by salvaging,thrifting, creating, swapping, or otherwise reducing waste, improvingcreativity, and strengthening social ties. Like the potlatch societies, you canpractice giving away money, goods, and time to those more needy, in order todemonstrate and manifest abundance.And, we all can take political action to transform some of the government rulesof the market game. The current world recession won’t lift by resuming the pathof endless growth and mounting debt. A profound global reorganization has totake place so that we put a fair value on the natural resources that underlieour unprecedented prosperity. The leap toward a sustainable economy will berealized when each of us wakes up to the reality that you are the economy, andthe economy is you."},{"pageContent":"3THE ARITHMETIC OF COMPASSIONDAVID ULANSEYEver since I was a child, I have been searching for a certain number: namely,the figure for the annual Gross World Product (GWP). The GWP is the value of allgoods and services produced each year by the entire human species, and thereason I was searching for this number as a child is that I wanted to take itand divide it by the number of people in the world, so that I would know whateach human being was actually entitled to if the world’s resources were dividedfairly and equitably.I finally ran into this number recently, and I have now performed the simplearithmetic of compassion. It turns out that the Gross World Product is nowroughly $70 trillion. It is important to note that this figure of $70trillion—arrived at independently by the World Bank, the International MonetaryFund, and the CIA—has been adjusted in advance to take into account what iscalled “purchasing power parity” (PPP): which means that the figure is 70trillion units, each unit of which (sometimes called an “international dollar”)represents what one U.S. dollar will currently buy in the United States. (ThePPP adjustment eliminates from the very start any strategies of denial such as,“Oh, that doesn’t mean anything—you can live like a king in India for $5,000 ayear.” No. Wrong. You can’t live like a king on what 5,000 U.S. dollars willcurrently buy in the United States.)1[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts001]Now to the arithmetic of compassion:Since the GWP is roughly 70 trillion U.S. dollars, if we divide that figure bythe number of people in the world—approximately 7 billion—we get a roughestimate of the maximum annual income that anyone in the world is morallyentitled to (assuming that it is moral to strive for an equitable distributionof the world’s resources to all of humanity).So, dividing $70 trillion by 7 billion we get about $10,000 per year (again,that’s already adjusted for purchasing power parity: it’s 10,000 units, eachunit of which is what one U.S. dollar will currently buy in the United States).That’s what each of us is actually entitled to—$10,000 a year—and any more thanthat represents institutionalized and socially sanctioned armed robbery: indeed,every additional increment of $10,000 (beyond the maximum moral income of$10,000 a year) represents one slave somewhere in the world whose entire life,birth to death, is completely devoted to getting us our “stuff.”And unfortunately we can’t “grow” our way beyond this $10,000 a year figure,since at the current level of $70 trillion GWP we have already overshot by 50percent what the earth actually produces.2[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts002] That is, it now requires oneyear and six months for the earth to replenish what humans consume in a year.This unsustainable 50 percent “overshoot,” in which we are temporarily consuming150 percent of what the earth produces, is only possible because we aremetaphorically “liquidating” the earth—i.e., spending its capital rather thanliving on its interest.The fact that the human species is already in 50 percent overshoot means thatnot only can we not “grow” our way beyond the $10,000 maximum moral incomelevel, we actually need to shrink that by one-third (50 percent is one-third of150 percent)—down to below $7,000—just to come back to a level where humanity ismerely using 100 percent of everything the earth produces (rather than using 150percent of what the earth produces, as we are very temporarily doing). This isespecially the case since the world population is due to increase by almost 50percent—to more than nine billion people—by 2050.Of course a $7,000 a year income may sound rather frightening to those of us whohave become accustomed to the “American standard of living.”However, to place this figure in its proper perspective, it is helpful to keepin mind that according to the World Bank, at this very moment almost half of thepeople in the world (3 billion people) live on less than $2.50 (PPP) a day—$912a year—and a quarter of the world’s population (1.4 billion people) live belowthe official world poverty level of $1.25 a day—$456 a year.3[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts003]In fact, in 2005 the World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern estimated that onaverage each European cow receives $2.50 a day in government livestock and dairysubsidies, while 75 percent of African people live on less than $2 a day.4[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts004]So although $7,000 a year may sound disturbing to us, for the majority of thepeople in the world it would literally constitute wealth beyond their wildestdreams.Finally, it is crucial to realize that $7,000 a year per person is actuallystill far too high to be sustainable, even if there were no population growthahead at all. This is because at the level of $7,000 a year per person for 7billion people, we would still be consuming 100 percent of what the earth canproduce, and would thus be doing absolutely nothing to prevent the two greatestthreats facing us in our own lifetimes: (1) a mass extinction of the earth’sbiodiversity resulting from habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species,and overharvesting, and (2) catastrophic climate change that could render theearth uninhabitable for much of higher life including our own species.The solution is clear: we must immediately and drastically reduce our levels ofconsumption. Something like $5,000 a year per person (PPP) is probably in theright ballpark for what is ecologically possible and morally justifiable. Again,that may be difficult for many of us to hear, but remember that $5,000 a year ismore than five times the amount that half of the people in the world live on (orbelow) at this very moment ($2.50 a day = $912 a year). In fact, according tothe World Bank, 95 percent of all people in developing countries, which meansalmost 80 percent of all human beings, are living at this very moment on lessthan $10 a day—which, of course, is well below $5,000 a year.5[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts005]Of course then the question is: how can we in the “developed” world accomplishsuch a reduction? One common answer to this question—namely, “It’simpossible!”—is obviously absurd, since right now 80 percent of the people inthe world are living below the necessary level of reduction. Whenever I findthat answer spontaneously rearing its ugly head in my own imagination, I like toremind myself that Eskimos live in houses made of ice, but their lives arefilled with just as much love and beauty, and their children laugh and play withjust as much joy—perhaps more!—as our own.Beyond all its other characteristics, Homo sapiens is a species capable ofextreme adaptability. The time has at last arrived for us to become actual humanbeings, and to allow compassion—and celebration—to guide us into a radically newworld: a world where we experience “quality of life” for ourselves as beingindistinguishable from “equality of life” for all."},{"pageContent":"4PROGRAM YOUR OWN MONEYDOUGLAS RUSHKOFFThe credit crunch may actually be good for business.No, not in the short term. When money becomes more expensive, it is harder formost businesses to get the capital they need to conduct their most basicoperations. Even successful companies borrow money to buy materials, payemployees, and cash in on invoices that have yet to be paid. Without the cashflow provided by banks, it is a lot harder for many companies to function—muchless expand.With any luck, however, the future of business will be less dependent on banksand the currency they lend into existence. The Fortune 500 will become somethingother than brand names on piles of debt, and business operations will becharacterized more by what companies produce than by how much credit their“stories” can earn them on one of the stock exchanges.Yes, we are watching something melt down. But I’d argue that the thing that’sdying is not business itself, but a financial parasite—a speculative marketplacethat no longer funds business but instead seeks to extract value from healthycommerce. More a funds vampire than an infuser of needed capital, the investmentindustry has been exposed as a drag on business. The future of commerce looksbright to me because it may be unencumbered by the weight of this nonproductivecapital.This all began back in the Renaissance, when a waning monarchy was looking forways to preserve its power in the face of a rising merchant class. The merchantswere becoming richer than the royals. So the monarchs came up with an idea:chartered monopolies. By granting one of these new companies exclusive provinceover a particular industry or region, monarchs earned their undying loyalty—aswell as a generous portion of shares in the enterprise. They began to write lawsthat favored their chartered companies, such as preventing inhabitants ofcolonies from creating any value for themselves; they had to ship raw resourcesback to the mother country, where they were processed into clothes or otherfinished goods.This model of business-by-extraction carried over to finance as well. Europeantowns had used local currencies for centuries. Farmers would bring their wheatto a grain store, which would in turn give them receipts for the amount of grainthe store was keeping for them. These receipts served as local currency. Thesystem was so efficient, and people were living so well, that people of this erawere taller than at any time before the last few decades. By making localcurrency illegal, a monarch could force people to use his own more expensive“coin of the realm” instead. Instead of being earned into existence, this moneywas borrowed into existence.Over the next four hundred years, the business of money slowly grew bigger thanbusiness itself. A central bank creates money and charges interest to the nextbank down the line, and so on, until it gets to the business that needs it to dosomething useful. The problem is, more value is being extracted on each levelthan businesses can produce. There are simply too many institutions—too manylenders—to be paid.As the banking industry grew bigger and less regulated, institutionsconsolidated, making the notion of a local lender obsolete, as well. Loans arecentrally processed by bankers who have little knowledge of the companies orpeople to whom they are lending—and little reason to learn about them, sincethey are simply packaging and selling the loans, anyway.The house of cards had to fall eventually. The truly amazing thing is how longit lasted. And as our attempts to prop it back up continue to fail us, we mightconsider whether there is a better way to do business. I think there is.The beauty of this era—this networked, high-tech, and decentralized world—isthat we no longer have to do everything from the center. The laws andregulations requiring us to run our finances and resources through tremendousindustrial age corporations are more obsolete than ever. And real people arebeginning to catch on to how inefficient and risky it is to conduct theirtransactions in this way. They are starting to trust the real world around themmore than the mythologies created by the public relations departments of distantcorporations.Moneys are programmed. They behave in certain ways because they have beenembedded with certain biases. The United States mortgage and banking crisis of2008, for example, was no more the fault of particular bankers’ behaviors thanthe underlying biases of the centralized, monopoly currencies we use. This iswhy bailouts of those banks have not led to any broader economic recovery. Atleast that’s the opinion of a growing population of citizens and businessesturning to the use of what they call “complementary currencies”—alternative,net-enabled, bottom-up money systems that let them accomplish what money loanedout by the Fed just isn’t letting them do anymore.Complementary currencies treat money as a utility, rather than an asset class.Their bias is toward functionality instead of savings, transaction instead ofspeculation. And they are spreading quickly across America—not just in thecrunchy progressive Northwest (where people have been working on localcurrencies for decades) but the dying industrial towns of the rust belt, theinner city of the New York metropolitan area, and the nonlocalbusiness-to-business transactions of strapped corporations themselves.In 1995, as recession rocked Japan, unemployment rose and currency becamescarce. This made it particularly difficult for people to continue to take careof their elderly relatives, who often lived in distant areas. The SawayakaWelfare Foundation developed a complementary currency by which a young personcould earn credits for taking care of an elderly person, and then spend them onthe care of their own relatives in distant towns. At last count, the alternativecurrency was accepted at 372 health centers throughout Japan, and alladministered by a simple piece of software. Close to a thousand alternativecurrencies are now in use in Japan.In October 2008, as the U.S. credit crisis paralyzed business lending, companiesstarted signing onto barter networks in droves. One system called ITEX, whichallows businesses to trade merchandise, reported a 37 percent increase inregistrations for the month of October alone. Utilizing more than 250 exchangeservices now available through the internet, companies can barter directly witheach other, or earn U.S.-dollar-equivalent credits for the merchandise theysupply to others. This bartering already accounts for $3 billion of exchangesannually in the United States.Complementary currencies hearken back to an earlier form of money—the local,grain-based currencies in wide use throughout Late Middle Ages Europe beforeRenaissance corporatism and centralized money schemes were invented by monarchs.Local currencies were earned—not borrowed—into existence. They reflected theabundance of the season’s grain, and did not depend on artificial scarcity fortheir value.Local currencies actually lost value over time. The grain store needed to bepaid, and some grain was always lost to moisture or rats. This meant peoplewanted to spend the money as quickly as possible, rather than holding onto it.So towns spent and reinvested their money constantly. People did preventativemaintenance on their equipment, and paid their workers well. They worked lessand ate better than we do today. People had so much extra wealth that theyinvested in their futures by building cathedrals.That’s right—the cathedrals of Europe were not built with Vatican dollars, butlocal currency. The people of these towns were looking for ways to help theirgrandchildren profit off current wealth. Cathedrals attracted pilgrims andtourists, and have kept many towns profitable to this day.By making local currencies illegal, monarchs were able to monopolize money, andtilt investment and wealth toward the center. People could no longer earn moneyinto existence—they would have to borrow it from a central bank, at interest.While this kind of money worked great when it was allowed to function alongsidea local currency, it was not particularly well suited for local transactions. Itwas just too expensive and too scarce. It did not reflect the needs or bounty ofa town, but the needs and artificial scarcity of a market created by a monarch.Going into business meant borrowing from the central bank—and then paying itback, at interest. And where did the extra money come from? Someone else whoborrowed it and would necessarily go bankrupt.Either that, or borrow more money. And thus, the requirement of a centralbank–dominated economy for infinite expansion—often at the expense of theenvironment and labor. But most importantly, the new economic scheme wasdesigned to drain wealth from the periphery—such as colonies, territories, andrural areas—and pay it back to the middle. And it’s the way banks work to thisday, each borrowing from a higher, more centralized authority.Internet-enabled complementary currencies breathe life into the decentralizedmarketplace of real businesses. Our networks give us a way to verifytransactions and develop trust. Second, perhaps more importantly, they help ussee the way many of the tools we use are the result of programs. Whereavailability of printing presses may have encouraged counterfeiting of officialcurrencies, the availability of computers and networks is encouraging thecreation of altogether new ones. We are proving more likely to treat our moneyas software, and to write our own.Local currencies have spread far beyond the experimental fringe to over fourthousand U.S. towns at last count, because of both the new scarcity of dollarsand the availability of software and tools. Beginning a local currency requiresno store of capital—it is as easy as visiting the websites for local economictransfer systems (LETS) or Time Dollars.In my own town, for example, there’s a tiny organic cafe called Comfort that isseeking to expand. John, the owner, secured a second location for a sit-downrestaurant, but doesn’t have enough money to renovate the space. Although he hasgreat credit, he cannot get a loan from any of the banks in town. Even thoughthe bankers know him, they don’t have lending authority from the conglomeratesthat own them. So what’s John to do?John has turned to the community for help. He invented “Comfort Dollars” thatpeople can buy at a discount of 20 percent. If you spend $1,000, you receive$1,200 in Comfort Dollars that can be spent at the restaurant. John gets thecash infusion he needs to complete his expansion—and for cheaper than the bankwould charge him. The local community gets a 20 percent discount on food theywould be buying anyway, as well as the chance to invest in making their townbetter. This is a 20 percent return on investment, payable as fast as theinvestor and his family can eat.The Comfort Dollars scenario reveals just how much of the mess of the recenteconomic crisis resulted from the way we “outsourced” our finances to beginwith. The real problem underlying the global financial meltdown had much less todo with low efficiency, bad labor, or poor innovation than it did with thedecreased utility of the financial industry itself. Money has stopped workingproperly—at least in its capacity to lubricate transactions. The sad part isthat money is working exactly as it was designed to.Once we accept the fact that the money and banks we have grown accustomed tousing are not the only ways to generate capital, we liberate ourselves and ourbusinesses from a finance industry that has enjoyed a monopoly over our commercefor far too long. They have not only abused our trust through corruptself-dealing, but abused their privilege through systemic usury. Businesses areonly obligated to support their employees, owners, and customers—not an entirefinance industry.The financial meltdown will help many businesses realize that their prioritieshave been artificially skewed toward making bankers and investors happy—andtheir own communities less so. As we start to finance locally or from our ownnonlocal communities, our services will become more finely tuned toward them aswell. We will get better at what we do, rather than obsessed with growth (to payback lenders) or financing (to achieve that growth through acquisition).This is all good—at least for businesses that have any remaining connection to acommunity or core competency. It will be possible to scale companiesappropriately rather than to infinite expansion. It will be easier to take andshare profits rather than watch them be extracted by last year’s lenders. Itwill favor local and connected businesses instead of big chains operated fromafar by corporations behaving as if it were still the 1500s and they had a royalimprimatur on their business license.The future of business—real business—is bright, as it has been for close to amillennium. It just might not be reflected in the Dow Jones Industrial Averagefor quite some time, if ever. That’s because instead of earning money, we’ll becreating value."},{"pageContent":"5MONEY AS A ZERO-SUM GAMEDALE PENDELLIn game theory, zero-sum games are those where one person’s gain is another’sloss. A poker game is zero-sum. Those busy accumulating hoards of money try tohide its zero-sum nature by saying that the “pie” is getting bigger. Prosperityis not a zero-sum game, though “prosperity” is too easily conflated withmonetary wealth, which is not the same thing at all. Clearly, quality of life isnot a zero-sum game—quite the contrary. The whole bodhisattva impulse ofMahayana Buddhism stems from recognizing that individual nirvana is incompleteuntil everyone is liberated.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]All of the things that we might call true wealth: health, enough to eat,shelter, meaningful work, diverse habitats and resources, natural and artisticbeauty around one—none are diminished by all having more.But this is not true of money. If everyone had a million dollars, what would amillion dollars be worth? Money is a usurper; it pretends to be wealth. And itspretension is backed up by force, creating a new type of slave: the mercenary.And most conveniently, the mercenary, truly the oldest profession, is paid inthe money he protects. Money has power because of scarcity, and the threat ofscarcity. Without money you will starve and die, even if there is food around.Without money you will become homeless, sleeping in the rain and shivering inthe cold. Therefore when I say I need some dirty work done, you say yes. I sayyes. We say yes.Money is coercive, seductive, corrupting, and exploitative, hence often linkedwith diabolical power. “The love of money is the root of all evil,” suggestsPaul’s first letter to Timothy. Or, as amended by George Bernard Shaw, “The lackof money is the root of all evil.” Both sayings seem true: greed for more in thealready-haves wreaks destruction on a scale order of magnitude beyond the pettycrimes of the indigent. Still, lack of money, need for money, loads my soul withcare.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Money seems like a natural and necessary part of the world, but, actually, it isneither. Money has a history and a biography. It had a childhood and anadolescence. No one knows if it has an old age and senility, unless that is now.No one really understands money, and certainly no one, not even the governmentsthat print money, controls it, despite the best efforts of so many.In some ways money is the ultimate pyramid scheme—its value is surprisinglysensitive to human attitudes.“Your money’s no good here.”Others make money their god, their master. Pragmatic. Realist.“Money will win. Trust me. And either you are with the haves or you are with thehave-nots.”But how much “have” is enough? There seems no limit.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]I hear arguments against copyright laws—yet the first copyright law is againstcounterfeiting. No one is talking about doing away with that law! If money werea “natural” item of value, why not produce it?Actually, this is done all the time. Corporations create new stock, andgovernments create bonds. Moe Moskowitz, the late owner of Moe’s Books, a usedbookstore in Berkeley, California, printed trade slips that looked like dollarbills, with a cartoon picture of Moe in the center and the words In Moe WeTrust. On the back the clerks would write how much trade you had left andinitial it. Moe’s Money even had an exchange rate with U.S. dollars—on TelegraphAvenue one could get 50 percent of its marked value in “real” money.The monopolistically inflated value of the money of national governments such asthat of the U.S. Treasury is protected by armies and prisons. The coercive,zero-sum quality of money is nowhere more apparent. If counterfeiting money werenot a criminal matter, but only one of public acceptance, “official” currencieswould find their true social value. It is no coincidence that the corporateeconomy evolved along with the debtors’ prison.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Because most of us exchange work for money, money pretends to be a measure ofwork, of one’s contribution to society. This is of course ludicrous. In thetwenty-first century the connection of money to productive work is secondary oraccidental. In a money economy, one can work hard for a lifetime and still bepoor, while another can be rich by having money to start with, or by a fewvagaries of fortune. Fortune. And everything in between.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Fortune is a gamble, and the big money is in gambling. Nothing is beingproduced: it’s a game.“Made a fortune betting against Wall Street.”“Made a fortune betting with the big money.”“Here’s a million dollars: double it.”“Lost a fortune.”High risk: betting the dark horse, but with other people’s money. Dark horselost this time. Hmmm. National disaster. International crisis. And thegovernment as insurance: “too big to fail.” Send the bill to those who work.Otherwise money will be seen as a sham. There will be a collapse. And hey,nobody wants that. Charge all the workers a year’s wages, then get tough on“welfare.”[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]The head of Tyche, goddess of fortune, is stamped on a gold stater minted inSmyrna in the first century BCE. On Tyche’s head are miniature walls and guardtowers: the walls of the city, the walls of the state. Or walls of a prison. Orthe vault of a bank. On the reverse there is a statue of Aphrodite, one breastexposed. Security and pleasure.

The Lydians are also noted as being the first to tradeitems not of their own manufacture, to have the custom of prostituting theirdaughters, and to arouse the wrath of the Persians.The Chinese began using paper money in the Sung. Kublai Khan forbade thecirculation of metal coinage, though (as reported by Marco Polo) his notes wereredeemable in metal at his mint by metal smiths and jewelers. Exchanging wornand tattered bills for fresh printings cost 3 percent.In the West, the first circulating paper money was created in Sweden in 1661 byJohan Palmstruch, who got government backing by promising half of the profits tothe crown. He did well for a while, but printed too many bills. His bankcollapsed. As an act of mercy, he was allowed to go to prison rather than beingexecuted. Fifty years later the Scotsman John Law made a deal with thegovernment of France to give his bank a monopoly in printing government money,promising to pay off the national debt. Law’s scheme also worked for a while:trade soared, new industries were given low interest loans, and Law’s bankfinanced road building and other infrastructure projects. Then his bubble burst,and he died penurious in exile. Neither Law nor Palmstruch was evidently “toobig to fail.”The first issue of paper currency by a government in the West was inMassachusetts in 1690, to finance a military expedition. Banks, states, andwars.War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, anddebts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under thedomination of the few.—James Madison, April 20, 1795Wars, states, banks. The eternal triangle.Alexander Hamilton thought a national debt would be a national blessing, notonly binding the people together but also creating a need for taxation thatwould force people to work harder: “We labour less now than any civilized nationof Europe, and a habit of labour in the people is as essential to the health andvigor of their minds and bodies as it is conducive to the welfare of the State.”Of course, Hamilton was a banker, and stood to make a bundle.Julius Caesar borrowed large sums of money from his officers. Not only did thisenable him to pay off his mutinous troops, but it insured that the futuresuccess and prosperity of his officers depended on his own.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Paper money is revolutionary. Printing presses (such as Benjamin Franklin’s)financed the revolution in America, and later the revolutions in France, Russia,and China. Inflation caused by the promiscuous printing of money tends to favordebtors—it has an equalizing effect. The United States was born fromhyperinflation. The biggest debtor, of course, was the government itself.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Edward Gibbon, writing at the dawn of the age of imperialism, said that moneywas a stimulant—the drug that got us off our asses to rise above “barbarism.” Sowe run around on speed, inventing new doodads to sell, and suffering the lash ofwithdrawal if we fall behind. Economists talk of “injecting” money into theeconomy: stimulus. Like freebase cocaine. Hooked on money, then held hostage.“I’m the pusher, if I fall, you’ll be cut off cold turkey. So you pay my bail,my tickets, and my lawyer.”Money as a drug: if the right dosage can be found—printing just enough, not toomuch—it’s like magic. As long as people keep buying things they don’t need. Aslong as those in the business don’t hoard too much—which is of course their onlyreason for being in the business. As long as the real resources don’t dry up,the illusion of prosperity can be maintained with more and more IOUs. To thefuture. To the earth. Like all stimulants, money steals from tomorrow.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A shrine to money in a place of business is wholly appropriate: the first dollarbill framed on the wall by the cash register. Let’s keep it straight. Let’s keepit clear. Commerce flows through here. Banks don’t do that, though, norbrokerage houses. It would be too obvious. Overstated. Money is our business butlet’s say, instead, that it’s about your future: a warm beach, your money fornothing and your chicks for your money.Success counselors say you have to attract money with your attitude and yourmantras. Repeat every morning: “I admire the rich. I want to be like them.”Surely you don’t want to be one of the have-nots. I, too, wish to be paid. WillI get paid for this? Shall I dance? May this be my mantra, a spell: “Money,money, money.” Maybe just writing the word will be enough. Invocation.

The Calviniststhought worldly success a mark of the elect, and made hoarding a virtue.Hoarding, of course, is anal. The fecal, excremental nature of money has beenanalyzed by Norman O. Brown:Until the advent of psychoanalysis and its doctrine of the anal character ofmoney, the profoundest insights into the nature of the money complex had to beexpressed through the medium of myth—in modern times, the myth of the Devil. TheDevil, we said in our chapter on Luther, is the lineal descendant of theTrickster in primitive mythologies; the evolution of the Trickster, through suchintermediary figures as the classical Hermes, into the Christian Devil reflectsthe history of anality.—Life Against Death, 301My grandmother, a woman who always liked to carry a wad of bills, taught me thatmoney was dirty and that you had to wash your hands after counting it. Which isreally pretty obvious.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]And yet there is a Dionysian quality to money, or at least to spending it.Burning money would be very Dionysian. “His alternative worship is war.” NormanO.

Gas cannons. Flame throwers.People dance.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Aristotle said that money was meant to be used in exchange, but not to increaseat interest. He called the ability of money to engender itself usury([images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L03_r1.jpg]), the birth of money from money,and called it the most hated sort of moneymaking.They have brought whores for EleusisCorpses are set to banquetat behest of usura—Ezra Pound, “Canto XLV”[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Is money the best system? That lack of certain pieces of paper can condemnordinary people to misery and early death does not seem “best” in any way. Yetas globalization seeks out and destroys the last vestiges of the oldeconomy—based on barter and networks of reciprocal obligations—poverty will bethe inevitable result. A few, of course, will find new power and privilege, andlots of new gadgets. Everyone, in fact, will have new gadgets, even the poor.The poor may no longer have gardens or a pasture held in common or their ownfishing boats, but they will have new gadgets.Money is about poverty, and the threat of poverty. It is poverty that givesmoney value. By threat of poverty, one must not only work—which people havealways done—but must work for money, even if that work has no value or isdestructive. And money is about power—power backed up by arms and prisons.Poverty, power, and prison are money’s soul, flesh, and bones.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Do I have a better idea? No, but that doesn’t change my analysis. Still, justfor fun, let’s remove one leg of the tripod: legalize counterfeiting. Would theworld be better or worse? Would there be less poverty, or more? Less crime, ormore crime?“Oh, Moe’s Money, sure, I’ll take that.”“Treasury note? Hmmm. You got anything else?”One could carry around whole rolls of money in case one got mugged.Counterfeiting would naturally prey on the big currencies. Local scrips wouldacquire a new respect. And while the paper value of the tycoons would drop, theywould still be tycoons—they’ve been printing money for years. For everybodyelse, actually, life would go on just fine. Maybe there would be more trading.And maybe you’d want to know the person you were working for, and whose money itwas you were taking.But paper money is a relic anyway. Money today is mostly a web of interlockingdatabases. There have been proposals in the government to phase out thehundred-dollar bill, to curb the black market. Even the writing of checks hasdeclined. More and more financial transactions are electronic and invisible:card swipes, bits shifting on a hard drive. Little fees can be sliced off, thehouse take at the gaming table.And the “house” can create more money whenever it wants to—a note ofobligation—which can then be bundled and sold. Who needs a Fed? Get the U.S. outof the money business. Leave it to private businesspeople, who know what theyare doing and have such a great record. Like banks, or insurance companies. HaHa. We take your money and then we’re gone.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Burned.Burned me.Caesar burned me.My partner burned me.I’m busted.I need a hundred dollars.Now gimme money.Brother, can you spare a dime?[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Back to metal? An ounce of gold for a couple of pounds of laptop? Or furtherback, before money.

Maybea young man has to take risks to earn the bride price if he’s in love with agirl from a big house.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]It’s a question of scale and edge: before money, subsistence level was thepoorest one could be, and it was the way most people lived. Money has created apoverty below subsistence. Today some “earn” enough money in one hour to feedand shelter one hundred people for a whole year, or to pay twenty thousandpeople minimum wage, or to pay almost five thousand people twenty dollars anhour and still leave two hundred dollars an hour for oneself.Milton Friedman’s grandfatherly voice tells us that those women in the sweatshoparen’t being exploited, they are being given a chance—they are working their wayup. After all, when they lived on farms they didn’t have any money at all. Nowthey can buy things. Now she’ll do a strip tease. Now she’ll let me fuck her.Perhaps the bottom of the scale is a better measure of the wealth of a societythan the gold and jewels at the top. We need something better than the silly andwholly self-serving Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which really has nothing to dowith “product.” A country that destroys its farming soil to force out threerecord yields isn’t making itself richer, it is impoverishing itself. We cansave money by not dealing with our trash—better bottom line. Put the trash inthe water. Put the trash in the air. Plastic in the oceans. Save money. Writeanother IOU. Maybe deserts aren’t so bad. I’ll be dead. But hey, I’m rich now.Money defines only itself as “capital,” excluding air, water, forests, and thehealth, happiness, and harmony of citizens.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_L02_r1.jpg]The first duty of every citizen is to insist on having money on reasonableterms; and this demand is not complied with by giving four men three shillingseach for ten or twelve hours’ drudgery and one man a thousand pounds fornothing.

There are intrepidiconoclasts out there, refusing to reify capitalism, but they are typicallywaved off as fantasy-prone, Marxist, or unemployed. Most Westerners sadly acceptthat the only alternative to capitalism ever attempted was the “failed” Sovietexperiment. Thus has future economic discussion been ceded to the realm ofWestern imagination, where one idiosyncratic dys/u/topia after another isproposed only to be dashed. Before we all jump off the utopian pier intorippling delusion, however, let us try quizzing the original premise.Is capitalism the only system ever to support large-scale, sophisticatedcultures?Hell, no! Gift economies have been doing that splendidly, throughout history.Around the world, both historically and into the present, gift economies havethrived. In Native North America, they were the right hand of our constitutionaldemocracies, and still flourish underground. The gift economy of the magnificentIroquois League supported five nations from the year 1142 on, adding the sixthnation in 1712, and including another sixty or so affiliated nations along theway.1 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts001] The Lahu, or mountainpeople of southern China, have survived both colonial capitalism and Maoism intothe present, their gift culture battered but intact.2[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts002] The Berber women in Kabyliacontinue to manage abundance without capitalism in the unforgiving lands ofNorth Africa.3 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts003] The Minangkabauof Sumatra do just fine without capital; indeed, their gift culture weatheredthe 2005 tsunami.4 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts004] The Sami(“Laplanders”) of Finland are emerging from centuries of oppression, by bothSoviets and Western Europeans, with their gift economies alive.5[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts005] These are just some of the gifteconomies extant in the world, and the list does not even scratch the surface ofthe theoretical work that has been done on the economics of the gift.6[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts006]Why, then, the steady, determined gaze away from these healthy alternatives, allof them with economic histories longer and more robust than that of capitalism?Part of the determined oblivion has to do with ignoring the competition so itwill go away. Obviously, the West’s Cult of Capitalism—and it is a faithsystem—does not wish to lose converts. The rest of the oblivion has to do withthe structure of gift-giving cultures: they are all matriarchies. Indeed, thegift economy is the one, constant characteristic that all matriarchies,worldwide, hold in common. You, the reader, do not know about this, because, inthe West, these facts are taboo, forbidden knowledge.The hatchet job that Western patriarchy has done on matriarchy is a masterpiece.As a silencer, the fiat worked fine in academia, where, until the last quarterof the twentieth century, anthropology and history flatly forbade matriarchiesto exist. No one got a PhD by noting that they did. Marija Gimbutas study groupswere banished to a moldy corner of the gym. The male-run, raiding economies ofWestern Europe were officially billed as The Way It Is and Always Has Been,SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME!Elsewhere, Western law declared women nonpersons, while in religion, thatcompanion-in-chief of capitalism, desert monotheism, spent two thousand yearsblackening the eye of every woman from Eve on, while insisting implausibly thatmen had birthed everything in sight. That last violation of common sense workedbecause people had grown accustomed to swallowing at least three impossibilitiesbefore breakfast: denial of death (“Jesus lives”—and so can you!), denial ofwoman-worth (Adam’s rib, Eve’s sin, Lilith’s nonexistence), and denial ofcompassion (everlasting hellfire, Armageddon).Clearing away the underbrush for a plain discussion of gift economies requiresus first to look away from Western culture, a task that most Westerners have anawfully hard time managing. Even when they think they are discarding Westernideas, they continue Euro-forming the data with energy.7[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts007] This is because the most basicconcepts of any birth culture seed themselves so deeply into the consciousnessof their members that pulling them into the light for rational evaluation is atime-consuming, emotionally unpleasant, readily sacrificed chore.The first, serious error that Westerners make in looking at, specifically,Native American cultures: the assumption that their own base number of One isthe base number of all cultures.8[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts008] It certainly is not. NativeAmerican cultures use a base number of Two. Western cultures use linear math;Native American cultures use binary math. In Native American math, the base unitconsists of two equal halves, which are immediately replicated (so that thefirst unit has a twin), resulting in what looks like a base four to users ofWestern linear math. In fact, it is just a binary set.This accounts for the very common “plus sign” symbol so common to NativeAmerican iconography. It connects with the cardinal directions of Breath (Sky)and Blood (Earth). When Breath, they are the Four Winds; when Blood, they becomethe Four Serpents or the Four Mothers. Just to keep life interesting, Nativegroups tilt the plus sign ╬ into an X, so that it is the interstices, not thelines, that matter. We are big on in-between spaces. When everything is amiddling, nothing can be an outlier. Figure 1 shows the standard colors andcardinal conceptions of the Iroquois. Note the traditional, tilted concept ofthe Twinned Direction of the Sky (E↔W) and Split Sky (N↔S). White (E↔S) wampumand purple (N↔W) wampum are referenced by the background colors.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_003_r1.jpg]Figure 1. The Breath and Blood of the cardinal directions.Translating all of this into an economic system requires something beyond basicmath, however. Human interaction is much more involved than simplistic linearprobabilities suggest, which is usually what Westerners try to slap overeconomics as predictors. Yes, diagrams of probabilities look complex at firstblush (see figure 2), but they are really just accreted, either-or propositions,following the standard Manichean list of choices: good or bad, light or dark,yes or no, up or down, as though such a list really covered all possibilities.(Figure 2 represents the line of a happy simplist, walking cheerfully along,until confronted with a yes-no proposition. Each answer follows its ownpotential direction, with more yes-no choices at intervals. The circlesrepresent the nodes where the either- or choices live.) Worse, we are assuredthat none of the previous outcomes affect future outcomes. I remember arguing inmy college math class the improbability of the first decision not affecting thesecond, whereas my professor categorically refused to accept my proposition,replying that it represented fuzzy thinking. It was not fuzzy thinking, however,but just Native American thinking.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_004_r1.jpg]Figure 2. Standard probability chart.What is needed to describe gift economies is a complex form of representationthat takes into account interactive binaries as mass in motion. This is because,in the world of the gift economy, everything influences the outcome ofeverything else, a primary implication of the Native American commonplacereference to “All My Relatives.” Nothing Native is a freestanding,once-and-for-all, over-and-done-with proposition, as each transaction isrepresented as being in exchange economics. Instead, there is a constant motion,in which every action is implicated in every other action.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_005_r1.jpg]Figure 3. A binary fractal. Image courtesy of Mark Dow.I have seen this idea represented in spiderweb format, which is not bad for atwo-dimensional impression of what All My Relatives are doing. The underlyingmechanism of this spiderweb image is fractal geometry, which offersrepresentations much more complex and fitting than a two-dimensional spiderweb.9[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts009] The idea of fractals is a set ofimages, repeating endlessly, each repetition, no matter how large or small, aperfect replica of the original impetus.At this point, the limitations of paper, not to mention my own inadequacies incomputer graphics, prevent any three-dimensional, let alone, moving mass ofimagery, but the reader should try to imagine just that. Neither do fractalshave to go binary, but the most convincing ones do. The limitation of fractalrepresentations is that each is a perfectly measured increment, so that the onlydistinction is in the largeness or smallness of any given detail. The irregularregularities, such as compose nature, do not come through. Nevertheless, thebasic idea does get across. See, for instance, figure 3, which is a nice fractalvision of the nearly seventy groups (the six nations plus the sixty-someaffiliated nations) of the Iroquois League. Notice the plus sign ╬ rotated intoan X, with the fractal repetitions mimicking chaos. The figure even includes thelight-dark contrast so common to League conceptions, for instance, white and“black” (blue purple) wampum.Gift economics start with the Mother, herself the initial gift of the cosmos.She gives to her child, who remains attached, setting up the prototype ofgifting. Traditional gift economies focus on communities, not individuals,though, while needs are defined both materially and spiritually. The idea is tojump into a self-replicating process that is already in motion. The size of thegift is immaterial, since the process, itself, is repeated. Any gift expresses aneed. Thus, all of our prayers give thanks, without asking for anything, yet theoutput of energy in the gift of thanks creates a vacuum that sucks in newenergy, the two halves completing one repetition (which, naturally, needs atwin). Since the action is no good unless communal, gifting happenings multiply,among All My Relatives, human and nonhuman alike. Energy is constantly inmotion, so that no one can hoard, constipating the works.Gift economics tend to confuse and surprise Westerners, who keep trying tointerpret them in terms of their One-base culture with its exchange-basedeconomics. The sheer idea of giving away one’s goods and energy as a means ofreplenishing one’s store of goods and energy seems counterintuitive toEuropeans, who give only on pain of death or, maybe, on threat of IRS audit.Consequently, extensions of gifting, such as gambling, just look bizarre toEuropeans.In fact, gambling is an honorable expression of gift economics, and one thatmakes full use of fractals to replicate chaos, the sacred action. Gambling onlyappears “immoral” to Westerners because they saddle it with the consequences oftheir own exchange economy in its most brutal form, and then blame the loser, ofcourse. In a gift culture, however, where it is not possible to “loseeverything,” gambling becomes what it essentially is, an act of fractalspirituality, i.e., the making of the heavy medicine of chaos. The energy thatcompulsive gamblers so love is spread over the whole community, which thenmutually enjoys it, as well as any goods involved.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_006_r1.jpg]Figure 4. The binary fractal of the gift economy. Image courtesy of Mark Dow.The best, two-dimensional representation I have found for the gift economy is infigure 4. It honors the twinship principal, whereby one consists of its twohalves, replicated in mirror image. The overall effect looks haphazard andunsustainable, but the gift keeps on giving, in actions writ large or small. Thegift economy is a perpetual motion machine, collapsing only when the knownuniverse collapses, or when Europeans arrive on the continent, with theirraiding economy, to gut the gift and still the motion.I do not know how to reinstate gift economics worldwide; that will take a totaldo-over of culture, I fear—but then again, a do-over is what the prophecies arepromising. For the record, it is only the Mayas who quote the 2012 date, and itis only Europeans who turn the prospect of 2012 into their own doomsday. Amongthe Iroquois, prophecy gives the date as 2010, and it indicates a process, not asolitary event.10 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts010] This prophecyconnects with the original Peacemaker’s prophecy from the twelfth century, inwhich he predicted the coming of The White Panther of Discord, when thechildren’s faces would be ground into the dirt and heads would roll west.11[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts011] Once the invader had taken allthe land from the Indians, even ripping off the scalp of Mother Earth for thescalp bounty, then Great Grandmother Turtle, who carries us all on her back,would begin to rock the edges of her carapace, brushing off the annoyances.Finally, she would pitch, rolling over completely in the waves. When she rightedherself again as Turtle Island, only the Shining People (indigenous people)would be left, to start again.12 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts012]"},{"pageContent":"7THE TWILIGHT OF MONEYJOHN MICHAEL GREEROne of the least constructive habits of contemporary thought is its insistenceon the uniqueness of the modern experience. It’s true, of course, that fossilfuels have allowed the world’s industrial societies to pursue their follies on amore grandiose scale than any past empire has managed, but the folliesthemselves closely parallel those of previous societies, and tracking thetrajectories of these past examples is one of our few useful sources of guidanceif we want to know where the current versions are headed.The metastasis of money through every aspect of life in the modern industrialworld is a good example. While no past society, as far as we know, took thisprocess as far as we have, the replacement of wealth with its own abstractrepresentations is no new thing. As Giambattista Vico pointed out back in theeighteenth century, complex societies move from the concrete to the abstractover their life cycles, and this influences economic life as much as anythingelse. Just as political power begins with raw violence and evolves towardprogressively more subtle means of suasion, economic activity begins with thedirect exchange of real wealth and evolves through a similar process ofabstraction: first, one prized commodity becomes the standard measure for allother kinds of wealth; then, receipts that can be exchanged for some fixed sumof that commodity become a unit of exchange; finally, promises to pay someamount of these receipts on demand, or at a fixed point in the future, enterinto circulation, and these may end up largely replacing the receiptsthemselves.This movement toward abstraction has important advantages for complex societies,because abstractions can be deployed with a much smaller investment of resourcesthan it takes to mobilize the concrete realities that back them up. We couldhave resolved the 2008 debate about who should rule the United States theold-fashioned way, by having McCain and Obama call their supporters to arms,march to war, and settle the matter in battle amid a hail of bullets and cannonshot on a fine September day on some Iowa prairie. Still, the cost in lives,money, and collateral damage would have been far in excess of those involved inan election. In much the same way, the complexities involved in paying officeworkers in kind, or even in cash, make an economy of abstractions much lesscumbersome for all concerned.At the same time, there’s a trap hidden in the convenience of abstractions: thefurther you get from the concrete realities, the larger the chance becomes thatthe concrete realities may not actually be there when needed. History islittered with the corpses of regimes that let their power become so abstractthat they could no longer counter a challenge on the fundamental level of rawviolence; it’s been said of Chinese history, and could be said of any othercivilization, that its basic rhythm is the tramp of hobnailed boots going upstairs, followed by the whisper of silk slippers going back down. In the sameway, economic abstractions keep functioning only so long as actual goods andservices exist to be bought and sold, and it’s only in the pipe dreams ofeconomists that the abstractions guarantee the presence of the goods andservices. Vico argued that this trap is a central driving force behind thedecline and fall of civilizations; the movement toward abstraction goes so farthat the concrete realities are neglected. In the end the realities trickle awayunnoticed, until a shock of some kind strikes the tower of abstractions builtatop the void the realities once filled, and the whole structure tumbles to theground.We are uncomfortably close to such a possibility just now, especially in oureconomic affairs. Over the last century, with the assistance of the economichypercomplexity made possible by fossil fuels, the world’s industrial nationshave taken the process of economic abstraction further than any previouscivilization. On top of the usual levels of abstraction—a commodity used tomeasure value (gold), receipts that could be exchanged for that commodity (papermoney), and promises to pay the receipts (checks and other financialpaper)—contemporary societies have built an extraordinary pyramid of additionalabstractions. Unlike the pyramids of Egypt, furthermore, this one has its narrowend on the ground, in the realm of actual goods and services, and widens as itgoes up.The consequence of all this pyramid building is that there are not enough goodsand services on earth to equal, at current prices, more than a small percentageof the face value of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other fiscal exotica now incirculation. The vast majority of economic activity in today’s world consistspurely of exchanges among these representations of representations ofrepresentations of wealth. This is why the real economy of goods and servicescan go into a free fall like the one we have seen in recent years, withouthaving more than a modest impact so far on an increasingly hallucinatory economyof fiscal abstractions.Yet an impact it will have, if the free fall proceeds far enough. This is Vico’spoint, and it’s a possibility that has been taken far too lightly both by thepolitical classes of today’s industrial societies and by their critics on eitherend of the political spectrum. An economy of hallucinated wealth depends utterlyon the willingness of all participants to pretend that the hallucinations havereal value. When that willingness slackens, the pretense can evaporate in recordtime. This is how financial bubbles turn into financial panics: the collectivefantasy of value that surrounds tulip bulbs, or stocks, or suburban tracthousing, or any other speculative vehicle, dissolves into a mad rush for theexits. That rush has been peaceful to date; but it need not always be.The industrial age is in some sense the ultimate speculative bubble, athree-century-long binge driven by the fantasy of infinite economic growth on afinite planet with even more finite supplies of cheap abundant energy. Still, Iam coming to think that this megabubble has spawned a second bubble on nearlythe same scale. The vehicle for this secondary megabubble is money—meaning herethe entire contents of what I’ve called elsewhere the tertiary economy, theprofusion of abstract representations of wealth that dominate our economic lifeand have all but smothered the real economy of goods and services, to saynothing of the primary economy of natural systems that keeps all of us alive.Speculative bubbles are defined in various ways, but classic examples—the 1929stock binge, say, or the 2005–2008 housing bubble—have certain standard featuresin common. First, the value of whatever item is at the center of the bubbleshows a sustained rise in price not justified by changes in the wider economy,or in any concrete value the item might have. A speculative bubble in moneyfunctions a bit differently than other bubbles, because the speculative vehicleis also the measure of value; instead of one dollar increasing in value untilit’s worth two, one dollar becomes two. Where stocks or tract houses go zoomingup in price when a bubble focuses on them, then, what climbs in a money bubbleis the total amount of paper wealth in circulation. That’s certainly happened inrecent decades.A second standard feature of speculative bubbles is that they absorb most of thefictive value they create, rather than spilling it back into the rest of theeconomy. In a stock bubble, for example, a majority of the money that comes fromstock sales goes right back into the market; without this feedback loop, abubble can’t sustain itself for long. In a money bubble, this same rule holdsgood; most of the paper earnings generated by the bubble end up being reinvestedin some other form of paper wealth. Here again, this has certainly happened; theonly reason we haven’t see 1,000 percent inflation as a result of the vastmanufacture of paper wealth in recent decades is that most of it has been usedsolely to buy even more newly manufactured paper wealth.A third standard feature of speculative bubbles is that the number of peopleinvolved in them climbs steadily as the bubble proceeds. In 1929, the stockmarket was deluged by amateur investors who had never before bought a share ofanything; in 2006, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people whopreviously thought of houses only as something to live in came to think of themas a ticket to overnight wealth, and sank their net worth in real estate as aresult. The metastasis of the money economy, which I have written about as well,is another example of the same process at work.Finally, of course, bubbles always pop. When that happens, the speculativevehicle du jour comes crashing back to earth, losing the great majority of itsassumed value, and the mass of amateur investors, having lost anything they madeand usually a great deal more, trickle away from the market. This has not yethappened to the current money bubble. It might be a good idea to start thinkingabout what might happen if it does so.The effects of a money panic would be focused uncomfortably close to home, Isuspect, because the bulk of the hyperexpansion of money in recent decades hasfocused on a single currency, the U.S. dollar. That bomb might have been defusedif 2008’s collapse of the housing bubble had been allowed to run its course,because this would have eliminated no small amount of the dollar-denominatedabstractions generated by the excesses of recent years. Unfortunately the U.S.government chose instead to try to reinflate the bubble economy by spendingmoney it doesn’t have through an orgy of borrowing and some very dubious fiscalgimmickry. A great many foreign governments are accordingly becoming reluctantto lend the United States more money, and at least one rising power—China—hasbeen quietly cashing in its dollar reserves for commodities and other forms offar less abstract wealth.Up until now, it has been in the best interests of other industrial nations toprop up the United States with a steady stream of credit, so that it canbankrupt itself filling its self-imposed role as global policeman. It’s been avery comfortable arrangement, since other nations haven’t had to shoulder morethan a tiny fraction of the costs of dealing with rogue states, keeping theMiddle East divided against itself, or maintaining economic hegemony over anincreasingly restive third world, while receiving the benefits of all thesepolicies. The end of the age of cheap fossil fuel, however, has thrown a wildcard into the game. As world petroleum production falters, it must have occurredto the leaders of other nations that if the United States no longer consumedroughly a quarter of the world’s fossil fuel supply, there would be a great dealmore for everyone else to share out. The possibility that other nations mightdecide that this potential gain outweighs the advantages of keeping the UnitedStates solvent may make the next decade or so interesting, in the sense of thefamous Chinese curse.Over the longer term, on the other hand, it’s safe to assume that the vastmajority of paper assets now in circulation, whatever the currency in whichthey’re denominated, will lose essentially all their value. This might happenquickly, or it might unfold over decades, but the world’s supply of abstractrepresentations of wealth is so much vaster than its supply of concrete wealththat something has to give sooner or later. Future economic growth won’t make upthe difference; the end of the age of cheap fossil fuel makes growth in the realeconomy of goods and services a thing of the past, outside of rare andself-limiting situations. As the limits to growth tighten, and become firstbarriers to growth and then drivers of contraction, shrinkage in the realeconomy will become the rule, heightening the mismatch between money and wealthand increasing the pressure toward depreciation of the real value of paperassets.Once again, though, all this has happened before. Just as increasing economicabstraction is a common feature of the history of complex societies, theunraveling of that abstraction is a common feature of their decline and fall.The desperate expedients now being pursued to expand the American money supplyin a rapidly contracting economy have exact equivalents in, say, the equallydesperate measures taken by the Roman Empire in its last years to expand its ownmoney supply by debasing its coinage. The Roman economy achieved very highlevels of complexity and an international reach; its moneylenders—we would callthem financiers today—were a major economic force, and credit played a sizeablerole in everyday economic life. In the decline and fall of the empire, all thiswent away. The farmers who pastured their sheep in the ruins of Rome’s forumduring the Dark Ages lived in an economy of barter and feudal custom, in whichcoins were rare items more often used as jewelry than as a medium of exchange.A similar trajectory almost certainly waits in the future of our own economicsystem, though what use the shepherds who pasture their flocks on the Mall inthe ruins of a future Washington DC will find for vast stacks of Treasury billsis not exactly clear. How the trajectory will unfold is anyone’s guess, but thepossibility that we may soon see sharp declines in the value of the dollar, andof dollar-denominated paper assets, probably should not be ignored, and cashingin abstract representations of wealth for things of more enduring value mightwell belong high on the list of sensible preparations for the future."},{"pageContent":"8CHANGE YOUR TIME ZONE, CHANGE YOUR MINDELLEN PEARLMANIn three hours I will be rich.In five hours I can only eat out once a month.In thirteen hours I can buy myself an apartment paying full cash.But right now, in this moment I could face foreclosure on my home.During the next twenty-four hours nothing will have changed in my life.

Not all the world’s peoplecan just hop on an airplane and zip off to destinations known or unknown. Thereare undeniably serious problems with poverty, dislocation, and starvation. WhatI am referring to here is more subjective. It is the perception behind what wedesire, not the immutability and direness of critical sustainability.I am a white, funky fringe American urbanite barely hanging onto my status as amiddle-class creative arts professional. In my home country I have adaptedmyself to the considerable economic restrictions that come with my trade; cabsare taken only to get to the airport, and my car is sixteen years old. I surviveon thrift store expeditions and lots of Craigslist forays. For the past fewyears I have been living inside artist villages that surround the outer rings ofBeijing, China. Before that it was Latin America, and before that, Europe. Ihave outsourced my heath care to the most modernized, lowest cost places I couldfind (Argentina, Mexico, now looking at India), been able to take cabseverywhere (China), and only been able to afford to go out for coffee and barelyeven that (London). All of this is not new news for anyone who has traveled orsprung for a vacation.What has not changed under any of these myriad circumstances is who I am andwhat I aspire to. My values, spirituality, and outlook remain the same—simpleliving, remaking and reusing most things, public transportation if available,vegetarianism, abstaining from luxury or brand name items at least on afirst-pass basis (though I don’t mind the quality if it’s used). Yes, I have alaptop computer, but my TV is only thirteen inches wide and it is secondhand. IDumpster dive when I have money and I Dumpster dive when I don’t. No difference.I have earned $100,000 a year and I have earned nothing.What makes this wide discrepancy in my material circumstances is money, whetherit is pesos, euros, renminbi, or dollars. It is various colored pieces of paperwith intricate layered graphics issued and handled by hoards of internationalmonetary traders who set my worth relative to where I stand on the planet at anygiven instant. The value of that paper, as everyone knows, can fluctuatetremendously. In China, I am perceived as a wealthy Westerner—no questionsasked. That perception gains me entrée into the highest levels of society; Imean lunch with millionaires, powerbrokers, diplomats and even representativesto the National People’s Congress, levels that in my own country are not a dailystaple of my life. It’s easy to say it is because I am a foreigner, but that’snot entirely true. It is also because of my perceived monetary value.I am poor in Dubai and London, but I can be middle class or even rich dependingon the location of my plane on the tarmac. What does this say about the value ofmoney and self-worth? It’s not that money is not real, and its not that moneydoesn’t make a difference, but it does say that money is highly perceptual. Thevalue of that perception, which many people base their worth upon, is skewed. Iadmit I get skewered by it as well, especially when there is not enough of it.For instance, to stretch the analogy, say you have purchased a new BMW car. Assoon as you purchase it, it immediately loses a percentage of its value, even ifyou drive it a hundred miles for just one week. In real terms as the supposednewest model it’s probably still as valuable as it was the week before, but itsworth has changed considerably because now there is a little dirt on the tires.It’s certainly a more enviable position to be wealthy, or at least perceived aswealthy. The reasons are, besides material possessions, access, mobility,respect, and opportunity. Wanting these things allows one to develop potential,and enjoying the “better” things in life, although what is better does not sharean across the board cultural consensus. Some people think bigger is better, andbase their lives on that premise. It’s the pursuit of that premise that leads tothe successful Ponzi schemes that frequently make it into the news. However,severe lack of money does restrict survival levels and growth—there can be nodoubt about that.Another way to look at this issue of worth is from a Buddhist perspective. Anyphenomenon experienced is experienced only in the mind. The fact that thingschange is proof that they are transient and not as real as they appear. Forinstance, if pleasure truly existed it could never change into pain. You wouldexperience nonstop pleasure. The truth is you cannot hold onto change. But wheredo experiences really originate? They emanate from your own mind.Mind is powerful. For example if you imagine or dream that you are burning in afire, you might break out in a real sweat, even though there is no actual fireanywhere. Buddhists say there is no object and no perceiver of the object and itis the mind that solidifies things. Still, believing in objective reality isvery helpful when you look both ways while crossing a busy street so you don’tget hit by a car. But getting back to the analogy of the fire, as soon as youimagine the idea of flames you name it—fire. Names, in fact, are also imaginary.Think about all the languages in the world and the all the words for “fire.”What you are actually doing is connecting a sound or guttural utterance to anonexistent image according to a set of strange, grammatical rules. That is anissue of perception. So is money.Value arises from mutual consensus. In China, the cold green translucent stonejade is highly valued. The deeper green it is, the more expensive it gets. Ipersonally think jade is an ugly polished stone. It holds no value for me, yetthis view is at odds with an entire nation and five thousand years of itshistory. That is what I mean by perceived value. I am not talking about the nexthot meal on the table, which is clearly necessary for survival.What happens in times of economic meltdown is partially about perceived value;what got us into the 2008 mess in the first place was betting on the nonexistentvalue of imaginary future assets called CDMOs. That formerly illegal speculationwas made legal again in the year 2000 by an act of Congress allowed tradingconcrete assets (homes) for imaginary scenarios based on vague futurepredictions. This is the mass hallucination that has produced cripplingconsequences. It sprung from perceived, imaginary value.Now SUVs are out. Credit card debt is out. Spending beyond your means is out.Living on borrowed funds is out. Acquiring what you can’t afford is out.Recycling plastic bags is in and carrying fiber or woven shopping bags is in.Because of rapid globalization I can clearly see my relative worth radicallyshift in the blink of an eye. I see it when I land in a foreign country. I seeit in my own neighborhood.In three hours I will be rich. In five hours I can only eat out once a month. Inthirteen hours I can buy myself an apartment paying full cash. But right now, inthis moment I could face foreclosure on my home. Which one of these scenarios isreal?"},{"pageContent":"9REINVENTING MONEY: AN ECOSYSTEMATIC APPROACHBERNARD LIETAER, ROBERT ULANOWICZ & SALLY GOERNERCRISIS OF 2008By now, everybody knows that we are still experiencing the ramifications of thebiggest global financial crisis since the 1930s. The causes of this crisis willbe debated for years to come. Some are blaming unrestrained greed; others a“sorcerer’s apprentice” problem in which financial engineering created productstoo complex even for their creators; still others condemn excessive financialderegulation, incompetence by bankers and/or regulators, or even willfulmanipulation. However, all policy debates focuses typically on how to limit theexcesses laid bare by the last financial crisis, as if this crisis is the onlysystemic one that has taken place so far. While the 2007–08 crisis was thebiggest, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has identified no less than 122systemic banking crashes preceding this one since the 1970s!1[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts001] To this, they add 208 monetarycrashes and 72 sovereign debt crises. By now, such systemic crises have hit morethan three-quarters of the 180 countries that are members of the IMF. If we wantto ensure that “it never happens again” as all policy makers ritually claimafter each crash, would it not make sense to start looking at the whole forest,rather than any specific tree?From our perspective, what all this means is that we have now entered the periodof unprecedented convergence of four planetary problems—climate change,financial instability, high unemployment, and the financial consequences of anaging society (as predicted in 1999 in Lietaer, The Future of Money). Theensuing crisis is playing out (and will continue to play out) in a classic twoor three steps downward for every step upward pattern. Every small step upward(i.e., any temporary improvement) is predictably hailed as the end of thecrisis. The same thing happened throughout the 1930s, and it is only after WorldWar II that the expression “Great Depression” got used to refer back to thatwhole decade.2 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts002] It is quiteunderstandable—then as now—why governments, banks, and regulators make suchstatements, simply because, then as now, saying otherwise would only make thesituation worse.The next logical phase in this systemic crisis keeps unfolding as if onautomatic pilot. Whatever governments do, the banks and other financialinstitutions will want to cut back drastically on their loans portfolioswherever possible, in order to rebuild their balance sheets after huge financiallosses. Thus, while cutting back on its loan portfolio is a logical reaction foreach individual bank, when they all do it simultaneously, it deepens the holethat is being collectively dug for the world economy and ultimately for thefinancial system itself.The second stage [of this economic crisis] is an attempt by the banks to cuttheir leverage and reduce their lending, so helping to drive the economy intorecession. That will then feedback via bad debts in non-subprime lending andimpact the capital strength of the banks. So we will see an adverse viciouscircle of weak banks creating a weak economy which creates more weak banks.—Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus, London School of EconomicsThere is a super bubble that has been going on for twenty-five years or so thatstarted in 1980 when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister and Ronald Reaganbecame president. That is when the belief that markets are best left to theirown devices became the dominant belief. Based on that, we had a new phase ofglobalization of financial markets and liberalization of financial markets. Theidea is false. Markets do not correct towards equilibrium.… the whole construct,this really powerful financial structure, has been built on false grounds. Forthe first time, the entire system has been engaged in this [economic] crisis.—George Soros, global financier and philanthropistThe Economist editorialized in its lead story on October 11, 2008, “Confidenceis everything in finance … With a flawed diagnosis of the causes of the crisis,it is hardly surprising that many policymakers have failed to understand itsprogression.”3 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts003] This chapter willshow that this is indeed the case, although in a deeper way than The Economistitself believes.The last time we dealt with a crisis of this scale, the 1930s, it ended upcreating widespread totalitarianism and ultimately World War II. The trilliondollar questions are:How can we do better this time?What are the strategies that will prevent us getting caught in an economictailspin?What are all the available options for dealing with large-scale systemic bankingcrises?WHY SAVE THE BANKS?Since governments’ initial response has been to bail out banks and otherfinancial institutions, the first question must be: why should governments andtaxpayers get involved in saving banks in the first place? After all, when aprivate business fails, it is considered part of the “creative destructiveness”that characterizes the capitalist system.4[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts004] But when large banks fail,somehow that doesn’t seem to apply, as shown again in the 2008 scenario.The short answer to why banks are being saved is fear. Since banks enjoy themonopoly on creating money through providing loans, bankrupt banks means reducedcredit, which in turn results in a lack of money for the rest of the economy.Without access to capital, most businesses contract, which causes massunemployment and a host of collateral social problems. Thus, when banks are introuble, they can trigger what is known as a “second wave” crisis, through aferocious circle making a victim of the real economy: bad balance sheets inbanks => credit restrictions => recession => worse bank balance sheets =>further credit restrictions and so the spiral downward goes …It is to avoid such a tailspin that governments feel the need to prop up thebanks’ balance sheets. The next logical step is also formulaic. Whenever a bankor group of banks is “too big to fail” and gets in trouble, the taxpayers end upfooting the bill, so that they can start all over again. In the latest bankingcrisis, exactly as in the previous 122 major banking crises preceding it,taxpayer bailouts have been the answer in every instance. Central banks willhelp by providing an interest yield curve that makes it easy for financialinstitutions to earn a lot of money at no risk, and in some cases by buying backbad assets.5 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts005]Among earlier examples, the United States government, which fundedReconstruction Finance Corporation during 1932–53 period, repeated the exercisewith the Resolution Trust Corporation for the Savings and Loan crisis in the1989–95 period, and again with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008.Other examples include the Swedish Bank Support Authority (1992–96) and theJapanese Resolution and Collection Corporation since 1996. For the 2008international crisis, the amounts involved are unprecedented. Usually, the costsof the U.S. bailout refer to the $700 billion of the emergency Troubled AssetsRelief Program (TARP) that was spectacularly squeezed through Congress duringthe last months of the administration of President George Bush. In reality, theactual cost to the American taxpayer of the bailout exceeds $4.616 trillion!6[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts006] This includes the direct loansto Wall Street companies and banks, purchases of toxic assets, and support forthe mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets through federal housingagencies. This is an astonishing 32 percent of our GDP (2008), 130 percent ofthe 2009 federal budget.Bloomberg, which went to court to obtain the numbers from the administration,concludes with an amount at $7.4 trillion.7[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts007] The most comprehensive estimatewas performed by an ex–Wall Street insider. Before becoming a journalist, NomiPrins worked on Wall Street as a managing director at Goldman Sachs, and runningthe international analytics group at Bear Stearns in London. Her estimateincludes all the types of supports provided by both the U.S. Treasury and theFederal Reserve and comes up with a mind-boggling total of $14.4 trillion!8[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts008]To put things into perspective, even the lowest of these estimates ($4.6trillion) is greater than the entire inflation adjusted costs of World War IIborne by the United States. Indeed, WWII cost the U.S. at the time $288 billion,which adjusted for inflation would amount to $3.6 trillion today. It is evenharder to believe, but true, that $4.6 trillion is higher than the inflationadjusted costs of the Louisiana Purchase, the New Deal and the Marshall Plan,the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the S&L debacle, and the NASA race to the mooncombined!9 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts009]This begs the question: at what point do the costs for rescuing the bank systembecome unbearable? Governments learned in the 1930s that they can’t afford tolet the banking system go under, as this brings down the entire economy. Whatthey may learn in our times is that they can’t afford to save the bankingsystem.REREGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTORAs after every crisis, the political leitmotiv is to “ensure that it neverhappens again,” and the solution that is invariably proposed is to tightenregulations on banks to plug the holes through which the latest problem showedup. History shows, however, that we have engaged in the same cat-and-mouse gamebetween regulators and banks for several centuries, actually since the beginningof handing the money issuance function to the private banking system. To beprecise, while such reregulation may avoid the repetition of the identical trapsand abuses next time, over time, new loopholes will be discovered or created,resulting in a new variation of the same type of banking crisis.10[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts010]In addition, massive and very sophisticated lobbying is mobilized to reduce thescope of reregulation, or to provide useful loopholes from the beginning. Let ustake the example of Washington, because it is one of the few places where we dohave relatively reliable numbers on lobbying. During the debate on reregulationof the U.S. banking system, more than three fulltime lobbyists were working forthe banks for every elected official! Is it surprising that all the talk endedup with relatively marginal changes in the system?CONVENTIONAL SOLUTIONS: NATIONALIZATIONSThere are two conventional ways for governments to prop up the banks’ balancesheets, both involving a form of nationalization. The first is nationalizingwhat Ben Bernanke called in his presentation to the U.S. Congress the bankingsystem’s “toxic assets.” The second is nationalizing the banks themselves. Let’sbriefly explore the advantages and disadvantages of both.NATIONALIZING THE TOXIC ASSETSThis solution is invariably preferred by the banks themselves. It consists ofeither the government (in the initial Paulson bailout plan, for example, it isthe U.S. Treasury Department) or a specially created institution funded by thegovernment buying assets from the banks that they now want to jettison. Ofcourse, determining the price at which these assets are purchased is a verytricky issue, particularly when a liquid market for such assets has dried upcompletely, as was the case in 2008.Buying the toxic assets clearly doesn’t convince everybody as an appropriateremedy.11 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts011] It is also by far themost expensive solution, because it doesn’t take advantage of the leveragingfactor available in the banking system. Consequently, the injection of money bythe government as capital directly to the banks is a lot more effectivefinancially.NATIONALIZING THE BANKSThe second way to buttress the banks is by governments providing capitaldirectly to banks themselves, either by buying stocks or by acquiring a newlyissued preferred stock. In Europe, governments have typically taken the banknationalization road: it was the option taken for instance in Sweden in 1992;and in 2008, first for Northern Rock in the UK, and then for a wide range ofbanks in all countries by mid-October.There are two advantages in this approach compared to the previous one ofnationalizing the toxic assets. First, thanks to the fractional banking systemby which all money is created, when banks make loans to customers, they cancreate new money at a multiplier of the amount of capital they actually have.Consequently, if a bank’s “leveraging factor” is 10, then injecting $1 billionin the bank’s capital makes it possible for it to create at least $10 billion innew money, or carry $10 billion in problem assets. In fact, the multiplier istypically much higher. For instance, Lehman Brothers’s and Goldman Sachs’s ratioof assets to capital were respectively 30 and 26, before they both disappeared.Some European banks have had an even higher leverage: BNP Parisbas at 32;Dexia’s and Barclays’s both estimated at about 40; UBS’s at 47; and DeutscheBank’s at a whopping 83.17.12 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts012]Therefore, very conservatively put, it is ten times more financially effectivefor governments to bolster the balance sheets of the banks directly than to buytoxic assets.The second advantage to buying bank shares instead of toxic assets is that thereis generally a market that indicates some relative value between differentbanks. In contrast, when the market for toxic assets has dried up, there is nosuch indication, and the decisions can be quite arbitrary.The banks themselves, of course, prefer to avoid the dilution of bank equity andcontrol that this approach implies. Politically, nationalizing the banks alsosounds like the “socialization” of the economy, since the former communiststates nationalized their banks. This ideological taint may explain why thisapproach was not initially considered in Washington.UNRESOLVED PROBLEMSThe first objection to nationalizing banks or their toxic assets is thewell-known “moral hazard” problem. If banks know that they will be saved when introuble, they may be tempted to take higher risks than otherwise prudent. Whenthese risks pay off, the profits are held privately and translated into generousdividends for the banks’ shareholders and extraordinary bonuses to management.But when they fail, the losses end up being absorbed by the taxpayers. Thecurrent salvage programs confirm that this problem hasn’t gone away and isunavoidably further strengthened by new bailouts. Christine Lagarde, minister ofeconomic affairs, finances, and industry in France, stated, “Moral hazard has tobe dealt with later … Maintaining the functioning of our markets is the toppriority.”13 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts013] This is exactly theargument that pops up at every systemic crisis.Secondly, even if both strategies—bailing out the banks and reregulation of thefinancial sector—were implemented reasonably well, neither resolves the “secondwave” problem: The banking system will get caught in a vicious circle of creditcontraction that invariably accompanies the massive deleveraging that will beneeded. Depending on how the reregulation is implemented, it may actuallyinhibit banks from providing the finances needed for a reasonably fast recoveryof the real economy. In any case, given the size of the losses to be recovered,it will take many years, in the order of a decade, certainly more than enoughtime to bring the real economy into real trouble.In practice, this means we are only at the beginning of a long, drawn-outeconomic unraveling. The social and political implications for such a scenarioare hard to fathom. The last time we faced a problem of this size and scope wasin the 1930s, and that event resulted in social and economic problems that endedup manifesting violently in a wave of fascism and ultimately World War II.Still, there are important differences vis-à-vis the situation of the 1930s. Sofar, the situation is less extreme economically, in unemployment and businessbankruptcies, than what happened in the 1930s. On the other hand, governmentsare now a lot more indebted than was the case at the beginning of the GreatDepression, and today’s crisis is a lot more global than was the case then.More important still, a financial/banking issue isn’t the only one we have todeal with. It happens to coincide with several major global challenges, by nowgenerally accepted: climate change and mass species extinction, the increase ofstructural unemployment, and the financial consequences of unprecedented agingin our societies. In some respects, therefore, today’s crisis is less dramatic,and in others far worse than what the previous generation had to face.NATIONALIZING THE MONEY CREATION PROCESSNationalizing the money creation process itself is an old proposal; though aless conventional approach, it reappears periodically in the “monetary reform”literature, particularly during periods of major banking crises such as the 2008crisis. For historical reasons, the right to create money was transferred to thebanking system as a privilege, originally to finance wars during the seventeenthcentury. So, contrary to what some people believe, our money isn’t created bythe governments or the central banks: it is created as bank debt. When banks areprivate, as they are in most of the world, the creation of money is therefore aprivate business. If the banking system abuses this prerogative, this privilegecould or should be withdrawn. The logic is not new: money is a public good, andthe right of issuing legal tender belongs at least theoretically to governments.So, while bailing out the banking system through nationalizing banks ornationalizing the problem assets is the classical policy choice, it can also beexpected that proposals for nationalizing the money creation process itself willreemerge, as they have in previous predicaments, including the 1930s. Under agovernment-run monetary system, the governments would simply spend money intoexistence without incurring interest at its creation; banks would become onlybrokers of money they have on deposit, not creators of money, as is the casenow.This would definitely make systemic banking crises a problem of the past. Itwould also make it possible to relaunch the economy through a large-scaleKeynesian stimulus at a much lower cost to the taxpayers, given that the moneythus created wouldn’t require interest payments to be reimbursed in the future.One objection to a government managing the monetary system is that governmentsmay abuse this power, issue more money than is appropriate, and thereby createinflation. That argument is valid. However, given that the current method ofcreating money through bank-debt made the twentieth century one of the highestinflationary centuries on the historical record, inflation is obviously not aproblem specific to the process of money issuance by governments. Furthermore,there is no reason that Milton Friedman’s proposal for the issuance of money bythe central banks couldn’t be applied to governments as well: put in place arule that obliges the issuing body to increase spending by no more than a fixed2 percent per year, reflecting the improvements of productivity in the economy.The most important reason that this solution is unlikely to be implemented isthat it will be doggedly resisted by the banking system itself. The financialsystem has always been and remains today a powerful lobby, and losing the rightto create money would hit it at the core of its current business model.14[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts014]Our own objection to this solution is that, even if governments were to issuethe money, while that might protect us from banking crises, it wouldnevertheless not solve the core systemic problem of the instability of our moneysystem. In short, it might protect us from banking crises, but not from monetarycrises.UNDERSTANDING SYSTEMIC STABILITY AND VIABILITYThe solution we propose below is new, and relates to the identification of thefundamental systemic reason for our monetary and financial instability.Understanding this solution, however, requires that we review some evidence asto why a systemic problem is likely, that we develop a scientifically soundunderstanding of its nature, and, finally, that we identify effective ways toaddress the trouble.The good news now is that we know a lot more than in the 1930s, and that we havemany more tools available than even a decade ago. Consequently, it is nowpossible to identify the deeper underlying systemic causes as well as a new wayto deal with them. Furthermore, this new way is one that governments can afford,and that actually addresses a number of other social and economic issues thatexist even when there is no financial crisis.At first sight, it may not be the bankers’ preferred solution, but it wouldactually stabilize their own portfolios while structurally stabilizing theeconomies of the world. It would also give them a whole new line of business, inactivities that would be particularly attractive for local and regional banks.Introducing such a systemic solution is the only way to avoid periodicallyrepeating the banking crisis exercise, which all conventional approaches arecondemned to do because they deal only with some of the symptoms, and not thecause.BEYOND THE BLAME GAMEA lot of energy and ink have been spent trying to allocate the blame for thisdisaster. Greed in the financial sector, lack of oversight by regulators,policies that overemphasize deregulation, and incompetence at various levelshave all become favorite targets. Our view is that any or all of these mayindeed have played a role, but at the core we are dealing, as already stated,with a much deeper systemic issue.Floating exchanges rates, introduced by President Nixon in 1971, were the laststructural change introduced into the global monetary architecture, and areincreasingly being blamed as another cause for the instabilities. However, evenbefore this period, boom-and-bust cycles involving banking and monetary criseswere, in Charles Kindleberger’s words, a remarkably “hardy perennial.”Kindleberger inventories no less than forty-eight massive crashes, ranging fromthe 1637 tulip mania in Holland to the 1929 crash on Wall Street.Such repeated financial breakdowns, in very different countries and times, underdifferent regulatory environments, and in economies with very different degreesof development, should be seen as a first telltale symptom of some underlyingsystemic or structural problem.If such a deeper issue is involved, it would explain why each new set ofregulations achieves, at best, a reduction in the frequency of banking andmonetary crises, without getting rid of them or their horrific economic andsocio-political costs. If such a deeper structural problem exists, it would alsoexplain why even some of the brightest and best-educated people on the planethave not been able to avoid major financial catastrophes, however diligentlythey do their work, whether on the regulatory or on the financial services side.Finally, if our money system is indeed a structural “accident waiting tohappen,” then even if it were possible to perfectly control greed throughinnovative, tight regulations, this could only defer when the next disasterwould hit.STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE VIABILITY IN COMPLEX FLOW SYSTEMSWe now have scientific evidence that a structural issue is indeed involved. Thetheoretical origin of this evidence may be surprising to the economic orfinancial community, although it wouldn’t be such a surprise for scientistsfamiliar with natural ecosystems, thermodynamics, and complexity or informationtheory. The science that explains this issue rests on a thermodynamic approachwith deep historical roots in economics.15[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts015]In this view, complex systems, such as ecosystems, living organisms, andeconomies, are all seen as matter-, energy-, and information-flow systems. Forexample, the famous food chain is actually a matter-/energy-/flow-network builtof complex relationships among organisms. Plants capture the sun’s energy withphotosynthesis; animals eat the plants; species then eat each another in a chainto top predator; only to have all organisms die, decompose, and have theirenergy/matter be recycled by bacteria. Similarly, economies are circulationnetworks consisting of millions of businesses and billions of customersexchanging different products and services, which when taken as a whole, aresupposed to meet the needs of all participants.For the past twenty-five years, major progress has been made on understandingwhat makes natural ecosystems sustainable or not. This work is the naturalextension of Nobel Prize–winning chemist Ilya Prigogine’s and Club of Romecofounder Erich Jantsch’s work with self-organizing energy-flow systems. Infact, according to Kenneth Boulding, many early economists held energy-basedviews of economic processes. This changed when those who favored Newtonianmechanics during the late nineteenth century (such as Léon Walras and WilliamStanley Jevons) turned economics into today’s familiar views on the mechanics of“rational actors” and the reliable self-restraint of general equilibrium theory,an approach which completely dominates not only practically all of today’smainstream academic economic literature, but also the boardrooms and politicalvenues of the world.16 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts016]A growing body of empirical and theoretical work, published under differentacademic banners such as self-organization theory, universality theory ornonlinear dynamics, shows that all flow systems follow certain universalprinciples and patterns.17 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts017]Consequently, as Sally Goerner says about universality: “all [flow] systems, nomatter how complex, fall into one of a few classes. All members of a class sharecertain common patterns of behavior.” Similarly, Predrag Cvitanovic explains,“The wonderful thing about this universality is that it does not matter much howclose our equations are to the ones chosen by nature; as long as the model is inthe same universality class … as the real system, both will undergo aperiod-doubling sequence. That means that we can get the right physics out ofvery crude models.”18 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts018]The existence of parallel patterns and dynamics explains why similar energy-flowconcepts and analysis methods apply to economic systems as well as natural ones.Decades of studying natural ecosystems, in particular, have led to verysophisticated mathematical understandings of how a network structure affects anecosystem’s long-term viability, as judged by its balance between efficacy andresilience. Efficacy measures the ability of a system to process volumes of therelevant matter-, energy- and/or information-flow.Resilience measures the ability of a system to recover from a disturbance. Thesevariables have been more formally defined as follows: 1. Efficacy: a network’s capacity to perform in a sufficiently organized and efficient manner as to maintain its integrity over time;19 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts019] and 2. Resilience: a network’s reserve of flexible fallback positions and diversity of actions that can be used to meet the exigencies of novel disturbances and the novelty needed for ongoing development and evolution.20 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts020]Two key structure-related variables—diversity (the existence of different typesof agents acting as “nodes” in the network) and interconnectivity (number ofpathways between agents)—play a central role in both efficacy and resilience butin the opposite direction. In general, a system’s resilience is enhanced by morediversity and more connections, because there are more channels to fall back onin times of trouble or change. Efficacy, on the other hand, increases throughstreamlining, which usually means reducing diversity and connectivity.The main point is that nature never selects for maximum efficacy, but for anoptimal balance between the two opposing poles of efficacy and resilience.Because both are indispensable for long-term sustainability and health, thehealthiest flow systems are those that maintain an optimal balance between thesetwo opposing pulls. Conversely, an excess of either attribute leads to systemicinstability. Too much efficacy leads to brittleness and too much resilienceleads to stagnation: the former is caused by too little diversity andconnectivity, and the latter by too much diversity and connectivity.Sustainability of a complex flow system can therefore be defined as the optimalbalance between efficacy and resilience of its network. With these distinctionswe are able to define and precisely quantify a complex system’s sustainabilityin a single metric. Indeed, we now have a way of quantitatively measuring allthe relevant components separately: total throughput, efficacy, and resilience.Furthermore, the underlying mathematics are well behaved enough so that thereexists only one single maximum for a given network system. The generic shape ofthe relationships between sustainability and its constituent elements is suchthat there is an asymmetry: optimality requires more resilience than efficacy!Until recently, total throughput and efficacy have been the only means for us toidentify the relative success of a system, whether in nature or in economics.For example, in ecosystems, as in economies, size is generally measured as thetotal volume of system throughput/activity. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)measures size this way in economies, while Total System Throughput(TST) does so in ecosystems. Many economists urge endless growth in size (GDP)because they assume growth is a sufficient measure of health. GDP and TST,however, are poor measures of sustainable viability because they ignore networkstructure. They cannot, for example, distinguish between a resilient economy anda bubble that is doomed to burst—or between healthy “development,” as HermanDaly describes it, and explosive growth in monetary exchanges simply due torunaway speculation.Now, however, we can distinguish whether a particular increase in throughput andefficacy is a sign of healthy growth or just a relatively short-term bubble thatis doomed to collapse. Over time, nature must have solved many of the structuralproblems in ecosystems (otherwise, these ecosystems simply wouldn’t existtoday.)APPLICATION TO OTHER COMPLEX SYSTEMSThe question will undoubtedly be raised whether what we learn from ecosystemsstill makes sense when applied to other systems, such as economic communities.It is critical to understand that the findings described so far arise from thevery structure of a complex system, and therefore that they remain valid for anycomplex network with a similar structure, regardless of what is being processedin the system: it can be biomass in an ecosystem, information in a biologicalsystem, electrons in an electrical power network, or money in an economicsystem. This is precisely one of the strong points of using a weblike networkapproach instead of machinelike metaphor.The fields of engineering, business, and economics have all been focusing almostexclusively on efficacy, and therefore constitute a wide-open field to explorethe validity of the proposed metrics to improve sustainability. For example,electrical power grids have been systematically optimized for decades towardever-greater technical and economic efficacy. It has come as a surprise to manyengineers that, as they have approached higher efficiencies, suddenlylarge-scale blackouts have been breaking out with a vengeance “out of nowhere.”For instance, large-scale blackouts have hit huge areas of the United States andNorthern Germany. Among the famous ones, we should mention the 1965 blackout inNew York, or the Northeastern United States blackout of 2003, and the November2006 blackout hitting much of Western Europe. But, even excluding lightings andother catastrophic natural events, on the average every four months a poweroutage large enough to darken at least five million American homes occurs. Thedata should be available to model these systems as networks because that is whatthey literally are. One can then quantify their efficacy and resilience. Thesolution on how to rebalance such a system to make it less brittle, and todetermine its optimal sustainability, would be an obvious “hard science” testapplication of the metrics described here.The point being made here is truly profound and has wide-reaching implicationsfor all complex systems, natural or humanmade, including our worldwide financialand monetary system.Placing too much emphasis on efficacy tends to automatically increase size andconsolidation at the expense of diversity, connectivity, and resilience untilthe entire system becomes unstable and collapses. In short, excessive focus onefficacy tends to create exactly the kind of bubble economy that we have beenable to observe repeatedly in every boom-and-bust cycle in history, includingthe biggest bust of them all, the 2008 crisis and its aftermath.APPLICATION TO FINANCIAL/MONETARY SYSTEMSViewing economies as flow systems ties directly into money’s primary function asa medium of exchange. In this view, money is to the real economy like blood isto your body: it is an essential vehicle for catalyzing processes, allocatingresources, and generally allowing the exchange system to work as a synergeticwhole. The connection to structure is immediately apparent. In economies, as inecosystems and living organisms, the health of the whole depends heavily on thestructure by which the catalyzing medium, in this case, money, circulates amongbusinesses and individuals. Money must continue to circulate in sufficiency toall corners of the whole because poor circulation will strangle either thesupply side or the demand side of the economy, or both.Our global monetary system is itself an obvious flow network structure, in whichmonopolistic national currencies flow within each country (or group of countriesin the case of the euro), and interconnect on a global level. The technicaljustification for enforcing a monopoly of national currencies within eachcountry was to optimize the efficacy of price formation and exchanges innational markets. Tight regulations are in place in every country to maintainthese monopolies. In his seminal 1955 paper on this topic, Milton Friedmanproposed that letting markets determine the value of each national currencywould further improve the overall efficacy of the global monetary system. Thisidea was actually implemented by President Nixon in 1971, to avoid a run on thedollar at that time. Since then, an extraordinarily efficient and sophisticatedglobal communications infrastructure has been built to link and trade thesenational currencies. According to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS),the trading volume in the foreign exchange markets reached an impressive $4trillion per day in 2007, and the derivatives are not included in thatstatistic! Nobody questions the efficacy of these markets, but many people arenow coming to question their resilience.The global network of our monopolistic national moneys has evolved into anoverly efficient and dangerously brittle system. This system’s lack ofresilience, however, shows up not in the technical field of the computernetworks (which all have backups), but clearly in the financial realm. This facthas been spectacularly demonstrated by the large number of monetary and bankingcrashes over the past thirty-five years. Such crises—particularly a combinedmonetary and banking crash—are, other than war, the worst thing that can happento a country.Even more ironically, whenever a banking crisis unfolds, governments invariablyhelp the larger banks to absorb the smaller ones, under the logic that theefficacy of the system is thereby further increased.Today’s global monetary ecosystem is significantly overshooting the optimalbalance, because of its exclusive emphasis on efficacy. It is careening towardbrittleness and collapse because a general belief prevails that all improvementsneed to go further in that the same exclusive direction of increasing growth andefficacy. For instance, the global monoculture of bank-debt money as legaltender is technically justified on the basis of efficacy of price formation andexchanges within each country. Internationally, floating exchanges were alsojustified because they make the foreign exchange markets “more efficient.” Anoverly efficient system is an accident waiting to happen. In observing thedynamics of an artificially enforced monoculture in a complex system whereefficacy is the only criterion considered relevant, we find that the onlypossible outcome is systemic collapse.As stated earlier, nature has over billions of years selected the conditionsunder which complex ecosystems are sustainable; otherwise they wouldn’t existtoday. In contrast, humanity still struggles with the issue of how to createsustainable economies. We know that the theoretical framework applies to bothnatural and manmade complex systems. Has the time not come to learn in thisdomain from nature?THE SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONThe systemic solution to our monetary crisis, therefore, is to increase theresilience of the monetary system, even if at first sight that may be lessefficient. Conventional economic thinking assumes the de facto monopolies ofnational moneys as an unquestionable given. The logical lesson from nature isthat systemic monetary sustainability requires a diversity of currency systems,so that multiple and more diverse agents and channels of monetary links andexchanges can emerge.This is the practical lesson from nature: allow several types of currencies tocirculate among people and businesses to facilitate their exchanges, through theimplementation of complementary currencies. These different types of currenciesare called complementary because they designed to operate in parallel with, ascomplements to, conventional national moneys. The problem is the monopoly of onetype of currency, and replacing one monopoly with another isn’t the solution.As Edgar Cahn’s work on Time Dollars demonstrates,21[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts021] whenever complementarycurrencies begin flowing through the mainstream, the degree of diversity andinterconnectivity in the system will increase, due to their ability to catalyzebusiness processes and individual efforts that are too small or inefficient tocompete for national currencies in a global marketplace. This approach willcertainly appear unorthodox to conventional thinking, but conventional thinkingis precisely what got us into this trouble to begin with. This tactic can alsoresolve the dilemma of what to do now about today’s systemic banking crisis.OUR PROPOSALOur proposal focuses here on what can and should be done most urgently to reducethe impact of the financial crisis on the “real” economy, the one wherebusinesses produce and sell nonfinancial goods and services. It involves threecomponents: (a) actions by the private business sector, (b) decisions bynational governments, and (c) decisions by city and local governments.THE BUSINESS SECTORThe “real” economy is predictably becoming the biggest victim of the ongoingfinancial crisis. Whatever governments do for the banks, credit will be a lotharder for companies to obtain from banks for years to come. However, there issomething that companies can do themselves to avoid the worst aspects of thisproblem. It is possible for companies to lead themselves out of this crisis.THE WIR IN SWITZERLAND: A CASE STUDYOnce upon a time, during a crisis similar to the one in which we are now mired,sixteen businessmen got together to decide what they could do among themselves.They or their clients had each received a notice from their respective banksthat their credit line was going to be reduced or eliminated; hence bankruptcywas only a question of time. They realized that business A had needed the bankloan to buy goods from business B, which in turn needed money to buy stuff fromits own suppliers. So they decided to create a mutual credit system amongthemselves, inviting their clients and suppliers to join. When business A boughtsomething from B, A got a debit and B the corresponding credit. They createdtheir own currency, whose value was identical to the national money, but withthe interesting feature that it didn’t bear interest.The country’s banks mounted a massive press campaign to try to squelch thisrevolutionary idea. Miraculously, that campaign failed, and this little systemsaved the businesses involved at the time. A cooperative was set up among theusers to keep the accounts dealing with that currency. Soon participants couldalso borrow from that cooperative in that currency at the remarkably lowinterest rate of 1 percent. All such loans needed to be backed by inventory orother assets. Over time, the system grew to include up to one-quarter of all thebusinesses of the entire country.Sixty-five years later, James Stodder from Rensselaer Polytechnic Instituteperformed an econometric study proving that the secret for the country’slegendary economic stability was that strange little unofficial currency,circulating among businesses in parallel with the national money. Thatwell-known economic resilience was usually credited to some mysterious andunknown national characteristic. Stodder’s remarkable quantitative study usedmore than sixty years of high quality data to prove the points made in thisstory.22 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts022]Whenever there was a recession, the volume of activity in this unofficialcurrency would expand significantly, thereby reducing the recession’s impact onsales and unemployment. Whenever there was a boom, business in national currencyexpanded, while activity in the unofficial currency proportionally dropped backagain. The surprising implication of this study is that the spontaneouscounter-cyclical behavior of this little “unorthodox” system actually helped thecentral bank of the country in its efforts to stabilize the economy.This is not a fairy tale, but the true story of the WIR system in Switzerland;the sixteen founders met in Zurich in the year 1934, and the system is stilloperating today. The annual volume of business in the WIR currency is now about$2 billion per year. The WIR system is also now accepting deposits and makingloans in Swiss francs as well as in WIR. The biggest limitation of the WIRsystem is that WIR are not convertible into national money. Therefore, creditsearned in WIR need to be spent on good and services of other members of the samenetwork. That limitation has now been resolved thanks to another complementarycurrency innovation called the Commercial Credit Circuit (C3).COMMERCIAL CREDIT CIRCUITS (C3)It is also a well-known fact that the vast majority of private jobs (between 80and 90 percent) are provided by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Andthe survival of many such firms is now increasingly at risk because of cash flowproblems.SMEs are being pressured by suppliers for prompt payments, say within thirtydays, while their larger customers pay them only in ninety or more days. Thisbecomes a deadly cash flow trap whenever banks refuse to provide bridgefinancing, or do so at steep conditions. This problem has become more criticalrecently in developed countries under the impact of the financial crisis, but ithas long been an endemic issue in developing countries.The Social Trade Organisation (STRO), a Dutch research and development NGO, hassuccessfully developed business models over the past decade in several LatinAmerican countries which culminated with a financial innovation thatstructurally addresses this precise challenge. The process uses insured invoicesor other payment claims as liquid payment instruments within abusiness-to-business clearing network. Each recipient of such an instrument hasthe choice to either cash it in national money (at a cost), or directly pay itsown suppliers with the proceeds of the insured invoice. This is achieved via thefollowing six steps: 1. Participating businesses start by securing an invoice insurance up to a predetermined amount, based on the specific credit worthiness of their own business and of the claims they obtain on third parties. 2. The business that has obtained such an insurance (hereafter referred to as business A) opens a checking account in the clearing network, electronically exchanges the insured invoice for clearing funds, and pays its supplier (business B) immediately and fully with those clearing funds via the clearing network. 3. To receive its payment, business B only needs to open its own checking account in the network. Business B has now two options: either cashing it in for conventional national money (at the cost of paying the interest for the outstanding period, e.g., ninety days, plus banking fees); or pay its own suppliers with the corresponding clearing funds (at no cost). 4. Whatever the timing of the payment is to business A, business B is in a position to use the positive balance on its account in the network, for instance to pay its supplier, business C. 5. Business C only needs to open an account in the network. It has then the same two options as business B: cash it in for national money, or spend it in the network. And so on … 6. At maturity of the invoice, the network gets paid the amount of the invoice in national money, either by business A or by the insurance company (in case of default of business A). Whoever owns at that point the proceeds of the insured invoice can cash them in for national money without incurring any interest costs.The implementation of a C3 a system has distinct benefits for businesses,governments, and banks.Businesses increase their access to short-term credit as needed to improve theirworking capital and the use of their productive capacity. The size of thiscredit can be built up to a stable level between a quarter (covering thereforeup to an average of ninety days of invoices) and half of annual sales, at a costsubstantially lower than what is otherwise possible. Suppliers are paidimmediately, regardless of the payment schedule of the original buyer, injectingsubstantial liquidity at very low cost in the entire SMEs network. The approachprovides a viral spreading of participation to the C3 networks from clients tosuppliers. The technology is a proven one, doesn’t require any new legislationor government approvals, and the necessary software is available in opensource.23 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts023] Only invoices that are100 percent guaranteed, and 100 percent computerized, are acceptable in a C3system. C3 thereby encourages the generalization and more efficient use of ITinfrastructure among SMEs, including the opening of new markets and marketingchannels through e-commerce.Governments, particularly regional governments, will also benefit. Notice thatthe most effective way for governments at any level to encourage theimplementation of the C3 strategy is for them to accept payment of taxes andfees in the C3 currency. This encourages everybody to accept the C3 currency inpayment, and provides additional income to the government from transactions thatotherwise wouldn’t take place. Furthermore, that additional income becomesautomatically available in conventional national currency at the latest ninetydays after the payment, thereby not upsetting any existing procurement policies.The first country that has followed this strategy is Uruguay.The C3 approach is also a dependable way to systemically reduce unemployment.Governments at different levels (EU, national, regional) can contribute to ajoint guarantee mechanism. Such a guarantee mechanism is considerably cheaper tofund than subsidies or other traditional approaches to reduce unemployment. C3helps shift economic activities from the black or grey economy into the officialeconomy, because SMEs need to be formally incorporated to participate, and allexchanges are electronic and therefore traceable.C3 systems are best organized at a regional level, so that each network remainsat a manageable scale. Businesses with an account in the same regional networkhave an incentive to spend their balances with each other, and thus furtherstimulate the regional economy. C3 provides a win-win environment for allparticipants, and therefore promotes other collaborative activities amongregional businesses. Each C3 network should use the same insurance standards andcompatible software so that they can interconnect as a network of networks tofacilitate exchanges internationally.The win-win approach of C3 also benefits banks and the financial system. As theentire C3 process is computerized, it significantly streamlines the lending andmanagement for the insurance and loan providers. SMEs can therefore become amore profitable sector for banks, because the credit lines are negotiated withthe entire clearing network, providing the financial sector with automatic riskdiversification among the participants in the network. In the upcoming surge ofnew competitors in the market—such as Facebook, Google, or Tesco currencies andbanks—this monetary innovation provides an additional window for banks to selltheir core activities. Most banks are also involved in providing insuranceservices. C3 opens for them a whole new market for insurances and credit, allthe way down to services for microfinance enterprises. As C3 is completelycomputerized, even such individually small-scale entities can now be serviced ata very low cost. Finally, the C3 mechanism systemically contributes to thestability of employment and of the entire economy, which is helpful for theoverall solidity of the banks’ portfolios.We propose that businesses take the initiative of creating suchbusiness-to-business (B2B) systems at whatever scale makes most sense to them.There is one more thing that the businesses that get involved in such systemsshould consider doing: lobbying their respective governments to have them accepttheir B2B currency in payment of business taxes. This could apply onlytemporarily, i.e., for the period during which the banking system will not be ina position to fulfill its traditional role of financing the “real” economy tothe extent that is necessary. The lobbyists have a simple but powerful argument:it doesn’t cost the government any money, will actually increase tax revenue,and is the best systemic way to reduce unemployment.GOVERNMENTSGovernments will not be willing or able to force banks to lend out to the “real”economy, any more than you can push on a string. Therefore, in addition andparallel to accepting the usual bank-debt conventional money, accepting somecomplementary currency for payment of taxes makes a lot of sense. Whichcurrencies should be acceptable for payment of what types of taxes is apolitical question that remains open for each government to decide.They also have a built-in interest in receiving payments in a robust currency.It is obvious that the existence of such a currency facilitates exchanges thatotherwise wouldn’t happen, while conventional money or credit are difficult toobtain. These additional exchanges, in turn, increase the taxable income of thebusinesses involved, thereby starting a virtuous loop that counteracts thecredit reductions by the banking system.When people and businesses are strangled by lack of money, taxable income isautomatically squeezed as well. By accepting some payments in currencies otherthan bank-debt money, by definition more governmental income is possible.CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTSThere are two reasons why we recommend allowing cities and local governments tochoose their own complementary currencies to implement this strategy. First,cities and local governments will be the first governmental entities to get intostill deeper trouble than they are today; and second, they represent diversityand resilience at work. Given that this approach is radically new, it is simplysafer to test out a new system as a pilot at a city or local level, rather thandirectly on a larger scale at the national level.Indeed, cities and other local government entities will find themselves in thefirst line to bear the brunt of the social effects of the looming recession,while at the same time they will see their tax revenue shrink, and conventionalfinancing through debt become much harder to obtain. This kind of problem is notgoing to be limited only to the United States.The London-based Observer asks, “What could possibly come along in the middle ofthis series of economic nightmares to make things even worse? How about a totaldepletion of local government finances that pay for the things that make up thevery fabric of American society? Imagine that rippling across the rest of theworld, reducing public services to skeleton operations.” Such ramifications arefurther explored by fiscal analyst Sujit Canagaretna:What is most disconcerting about the way this turmoil is panning out is thatmost state governments were already in a terrible state. But now things haveworsened considerably and the credit markets have a real choke hold on almostall state treasuries. It is so bad that economic activity in most states has allbut ground to a halt.24 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts024]The second argument for local currencies is that some diversity in experimentingwith a new strategy can only be beneficial to all concerned. If specific issuesare considered a political priority, other types of complementary currenciesthan the B2B ones described above could be considered. For instance, if carbonreduction is considered an important priority, a carbon reduction currencyprogram could be launched and accepted in partial payment in taxes. Someapplications of the eco-money programs in Japan are relevant precedents in thisdomain.Similarly, local or regional taxes could be paid partially in conventionalmoney, and partially in regional currencies. In short, a whole new set of toolsto create incentives for specific behavior patterns, either corporate orindividual, is now available, tools that in most cases have already been testedsomewhere in the world.Obviously, implementing a strategy of this nature should be done in carefulsteps, starting with pilot application on a limited scale. A European-wideproject, for instance, should be started with a cooperative venture on a smallerscale.ANSWERING SOME OBJECTIONSThe first objection will obviously arise from the banking system, which wouldprefer to keep the status quo. However, banks are going to be disintermediatedby a broader use of B2B currencies only if they themselves remain aloof.The second objection that is quite predictable will come from traditionaleconomic thinking: using multiple currencies within a national economy reducesthe efficacy of the price formation process and of the exchanges among economicagents. While this argument is valid, we know now that this overarching emphasison efficacy is precisely what has reduced the resilience of the system, and madeit so brittle.SOME ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED APPROACHOur proposal, therefore, provides a systemic solution to the instability of themonetary system, something that the current approaches are not even trying toachieve. Systemic solutions are the only ones that will avoid repeatedly havingto go through the same type of problem in the future. For example, as the WIRexample demonstrates, complementary currency systems have proven to be a keyfactor in fostering counter-cyclical stability.A multiscale multistakeholder strategy has a number of advantages for thedifferent parties involved, particularly during the transition period that wenow have entered. Leadership will be required at all levels—public and private,local and national—to guide ourselves out of this crisis. * This approach will avoid or reduce the strangulation of the real economy by the banking credit contraction that unquestionably is going to continue for a while. * The decision that governments should reach—accepting payment of taxes in money other than exclusively bank-debt money—rests completely within their own political decision power. This strategy is also very flexible: a government can decide to accept payment of certain taxes only, only for a given percentage, for specific types of complementary currencies chosen for their robustness and have other positive effects, and/or only for specific fiscal years. * Until now, taxes have been payable only in “legal tender,” which means conventional bank-debt money. Any currency is an incentive scheme, and our current way of dealing with taxes and subsidies is limited to that single instrument, which needs to be scarcer than its usefulness to keep its value. With complementary currencies, a whole additional array of options become available, which can focus on—and fine-tune precisely—the objectives that one wants to reach. We can, therefore, tailor the complementary currencies accepted for payments of taxes to the massive challenges currently faced around the world. * Complementary currencies have proven a useful tool for enabling the design of incentive schemes in a wide variety of domains, regardless of whether a crisis is at hand. The evidence for this can be found in a number of publications. * Perhaps most importantly: This strategy will avoid repeating the worst part of the 1930s scenario where economic strangulation was left to play out fully, which resulted in massive bankruptcies in the productive economy, intolerably high unemployment and untold suffering, and a toxic political fallout that has proven a dangerous mess to disentangle once started. Hjalmar Schacht, Hitler’s central banker, pointed out correctly that the electoral popularity of Nazism was directly due to mass “despair and unemployment.”"},{"pageContent":"10POVERTY (UN)CONSCIOUSNESSANTONIO LOPEZIf you want an image of post–American Empire collapse, there is at least onecontemporary portrait to draw upon. It looks a bit like a nuclear war circa1958, which is akin to what I witnessed in Havana after the collapse of theSoviet Union and the subsequent “special period” that followed. By the mid-’90sHavana’s massive deep port harbor was empty and there was little gas to drivethe scant, duct-taped cars that still existed there, yet it amazed me how musicand culture remained such a resilient tool of empowerment and happiness. Peoplestill played baseball, made love, wrote books, painted paintings, and jammed. Infact, in a postfinancial world, jamming might be a good skill to cultivate.Improvisation requires openness, creativity, and ingenuity, which certainly arethe hallmarks of survival and evolution (both cultural and natural)—which helpsexplain why during this period Cuba emerged as a world innovator in organicagriculture. No doubt, it was also hard to walk down Havana’s streets withoutbeing solicited by prostitutes and drug dealers, but when I visited there over adozen years ago it was a veritable hub of African and Caribbean students whowere there to take advantage of an innovative educational system focused onprovisioning without industrial resources. And unlike the polluted and dangerousstreets of modern capitalist cities, Havana’s avenues were quiet, with theexception of the clanging bells of Chinese bicycles and the breezy music waftingthrough the air.What is amazing about culture is how it persists in the face of cataclysmicadversity. Consider jazz, flamenco, reggae, and hip-hop as examples of high artforms that have absorbed and digested the oppression and destruction of so manylost lives. In the case of the Mexica (the tribal name for the Aztecs), theirculture transcended the “conquest” because of an underlying philosophy, flor ycanto—“flower and song.” I put conquest in quotation marks because many of myNative American friends remind me that it’s a transient state; consider the fateof Spain in the Americas. After five hundred years, who remains standing? Evenin California, as urban historian Mike Davis argues, “USA” is a temporaryidentity. In the surviving poetry of preconquest culture, Mexica verse speaks oflife’s temporality, and how each of us is on loan to each other during our shortlives on earth. Mexica poets were wise to know that empires come and go, butflower and song remain. Thus, an open, compassionate cultural architecture,though rare, is absolutely necessary. As the Dalai Lama has warned regarding theChinese occupation of Tibet, to commit to violence in response to history is togo to war with oneself, because the heart and mind can never be united in such aquest. Flower and song will die, however, if we let civilization destroy ourspirit.In contrast to the survivors of Tibetan occupation or the Spanish invasion ofthe Americas, affluent Americans should count their blessings. Life has beenprosperous and relatively safe by comparison to what so many have endured; wehave benefited greatly by other people’s misery, as the Situationists oncepontificated. The world’s “social majorities,” whom our system has condemnedmostly to death, war, exploitation, and malnutrition, may end up being ourbiggest teachers. Let us listen with open hearts to what they can teach us aboutsurvival in harsh economic times. One such teacher is the only artist I haveheard everywhere I have traveled in the world: Bob Marley. That kind of wisdomdoesn’t come easily.As it stands we will need lots of new allies. Due to the unfolding financialcrisis, we Americans are likely on our way to joining the majority of the worldin terms of economic resources, or the lack thereof. With deindustrialization,decapitalization, deconsumerism and all the other d’s that accompany Depression,this is a good wake-up call for a minority of the world’s population with thehighest per capita ecological footprint. Still, it goes without saying thateconomic decline is not happening without considerable pain and difficulty formany people. I don’t mean to trivialize suffering, but we can survive. Ask anAztec. Reflect on how the majority of the world manages while living withconsiderably less; in many cases the “poor” are significantly happier than richAmericans who consistently rank lowest in the world’s happiness index(Indonesians, for example, are ranked as the happiest people in the world,despite their considerably lower standard of living than Europeans orAmericans). We all know by this point that consumer goods don’t equate withcontentment. Having a refrigerator and dishwasher make life simpler, so we’retold; yet when the final bill comes due, maybe that perceived comfort comes at aterrible cost of unmanageable economic and ecological complexity.Oikos, the Greek root for ecology and economics, means “household.” Like inCuba, our financial home environment can be “disturbed,” to borrow a term fromecology, but our reaction depends on the level of diversity maintained in ourstate of being. The lesson from ecology is that disturbances have less impactwhen there is greater biodiversity to absorb the change in an ecological system.Just like the tightrope walker’s balance pole, the shorter it is, the lessability to absorb shock to the system. Like the Buddha said, add a touch of saltto a glass of water, and it will taste salty. But throw the same amount of saltinto a lake, and you won’t taste the difference.Consider, then, that your attitude is potentially the most diverse asset at yourdisposal, because it is the one thing you have control over (that is, unless youlet it control you, as is the case with most unconscious beings). We suffer frommechanistic interpretations of the world and act out of addictive behavior. It’snot just about the collapse of the petroleum economy or the disintegration ofthe finance pyramid, but the implosion of the guiding paradigm of Westerncivilization. If you think the global elites have a grip on the situation, youare very wrong, because grip is the opposite of what we need. We are badly inneed of an expansion of consciousness, and again, it is something you haveaccess to: given an average baseline mental state, no amount of economic despairwill prevent your mind from functioning as evolution intended.Still, Marx was right when he argued that material conditions produceconsciousness (we make history but not in the environment of our choosing).Let’s not lose site of the fact that hunger and withdrawal can lead todesperation and confusion, while at the same time acknowledging that if you dohave food in your stomach and a roof over your head, be thankful and continue towork on the big picture in little ways, both internally and externally.George Bush Sr. once said that the American way of life is not negotiable. Thiskind of mentality will not handle the disturbance of crashing markets very well.That’s why Americans, who are accustomed to a certain lifestyle, shouldreconsider what it means to be “wealthy.” Lynne Twist, author of The Soul ofMoney, argues that “abundance” is the wrong material goal, both personally andsocially. She says it’s better to be “sufficient.” I find this an aspirationthat is in keeping with the justice and equity equation of ecologicalsustainability. It’s in line with Gandhi’s notion that the world has enough forour needs, but not for our greed. Sufficiency suggests that we live within ourmeans, that we only consume that which is available in real time. Theecologically disembedded financial system has brought the world economy to itsknees, reminding us that we have to stop borrowing against the planet’s resourcebank through our extraction of ancient solar energy, and return to using thesolar energy that is available to us on a daily basis, such as from localagriculture and our labor. This is how our ancestors lived, and this is how thesurviving humans of this age will carry on. Labor, especially with our hands,has been a dirty word since antiquity. It’s time to reintroduce craft (work withour hands) as an asset and value. As such, DIY may be one of the best culturalattributes that Americans have for surviving this phase. But let’s unify the“handiness” of DIY with spirituality as well. To paraphrase a Sufi saying, talkto God but tether your camel.Sufficiency is a spiritual issue; a sufficient consciousness is in a state ofgratitude. Many of us are blaming the capitalist bankers and system for thedemise of our society, but haven’t we as consumers also collectively bought intothe hallucinatory orgy of the market? How many of us have harbored secretfantasies to be like the crazy guy in the infomercials with his yachts,beautiful women, and real estate Ponzi schemes? How many of my deepest spiritualallies have bought into those sleazy pyramid schemes or network marketing plotsto sell new age happiness that turn friendships into marketing opportunities?Like the ideology of the capitalist system, are we always aspiring to a better,utopian future rather than being grateful for what we have?I once participated in a “prosperity group,” which was a weekly gathering offriends (mostly folks from my yoga class) who wanted to read a “channeled” book,Creating Money, and to do the chapter exercises together (it’s a great book, bythe way). I realized rather quickly that most people in the group would nevertranscend their state of “poverty,” because they were mentally impoverished.That is, they believed that their lives lacked sufficient resources in thatmoment; they would always be trapped on the treadmill of negative thinking abouttheir present state of being, postponing happiness to the future. I don’t meanthis in The Secret kind of way, in which positive thinking is the panacea forall of life’s inner conflicts, but in the sense that we are constantlyprojecting into the world like a waking dream the innermost challenges at thecore of our being. We relentlessly seek healing, and oftentimes we externalizefrom our inner depths that which cannot be articulated by the egocentric (andprotective) mind. Consider how we attract substitutes for our parental figuresin both our work and romantic relationships. Is money any different? Maybe somewould consider Secrets of the Millionaire Mind a silly and exploitative airportself-help book, but I believe T. Harv Eker is onto something when he can detectwhether or not someone has the capacity for “wealth.” “We’ve confused attentionwith love,” he argues. Joseph Jaworski in Synchronicity puts the problem thisway: we mistake “having” with “being.” Are we always putting the cart before thehorse?Again, returning to the metaphor of the glass of water with salt, can we reallycontain our true desires, or more to the point, our self-destructive thoughts?It’s important to distinguish desire—something Buddhists say inevitably leads tosuffering—from nourishment. Along these lines, after closely reading CreatingMoney I discovered something quite useful. The book asks us to imagine what ourlife would be like if we suddenly received a million dollars (or any large lumpsum)—not to visualize the material goods we would accumulate, but to focus onthe feeling. What emotion or sensation would it be? What state of consciousnessam I aspiring to? At the time I was a struggling freelance writer, so my simplegoal was that I wanted to be able to write without the stress of having to queryeditors and to pen BS articles to pay the rent. The exercise forced me todeconstruct my yearning and to discover why I wanted to write in the firstplace. I realized that it was because it allowed me to connect with a higher,creative force than what I normally experience in the routines of daily life;that I like to solve puzzles and explore ideas; and that I love to lose myselfin the process of discovery. To put it in more intangible, esoteric terms,writing allows me to connect with the cosmos, which is this expansivearchitecture of creativity I keep alluding to. By the end of Creating Money’svisualization I learned something very important: I didn’t need a milliondollars to achieve my wish. All I had to do was to sit down and write. Problemsolved. The money would come later. Or not. But at least I would be happy doingwhat I love.In retrospect, I was probably also grasping for something precious that weadults tend to lose when we “grow up.” For a countercultural type like myself itwill probably sound funny to say that my most precious moments in childhoodinvolved building model airplanes and listening to Dodgers baseball games on theradio. In many ways we have not integrated these childhood experiences ofexploration into our adult lives because we suffer from so much pressure, eitherfrom the material economy itself (let us remember that the recent stock marketand financial crisis was not news to most of us who have been two paychecks fromhomelessness most of our lives), or from our wounded psyches still trying toprove our worth to disapproving parents. When I write, I feel like that kidsolving problems while roaming a dream world.All of this has to be put into some context. I’m well aware that everything Ibelieve and say is benefited by my “cultural capital.” That is, I’m the productof an investment of both my family and society in terms of education andopportunity. I’m self-conscious that what I say reeks of privilege. I have livedin a relatively affluent capitalist setting in which these experiences of innerexploration are permitted and encouraged. Still, I think it’s OK to talk aboutachieving happiness within the realm of my given reality, even though Iempathize with the person running from rockets and take a certain responsibilityfor being part of the problem (as my taxes paid for the missiles being fired atinnocent civilians who live in the periphery of our walled electronic castle).In my world travels, I’ve been lucky to do so from the vantage of explorationand personal growth rather than as a migrant worker. But in the process I haveencountered economically disadvantaged people who still maintain positivefeelings about their reality because they have strong relationships with theircommunity, family, and nature. Many have not been spiritually colonized byWestern ideology. For example, I recall a story I heard while living with a Hopifamily. They reminisced about a time when government officials had come to tellthem they were poor and that they needed help. In recalling the story, theylaughed about the reaction of government agents when they said no thanks. Tothis day there is a brand new tractor sitting in the yard that was given to thefamily by well-meaning German philanthropists. It remains unused, and will dolittle good when the oil dries up, anyway. Many Hopi still plant corn with astick and finger, and can harvest with the desert’s morning dew. There issomething highly advanced about that kind of simplicity.The truth is that we all operate from the means that are available us. I justwant to give thanks that I have lived a “sufficient” life and I hope that I canshare whatever wisdom this life has afforded me. As it stands, by blogging Iwrite for fun and generosity. I am fulfilled by the reciprocal relationship thatmedia and communications of the Web 2.0 offer. Meanwhile, I can make money formy “services,” which is teaching. For those of us with the means, the internetuniquely positions us to engage in service leadership, which means we help solveeach other’s problems. After all, we are just on loan to each other. In themidst of this richly unfolding economic crisis we can discover how the power offlower and song will sustain anyone with an alternate vision of our place in theworld."},{"pageContent":"11TIME BANKING IN SANTA FESTELLA OSOROJOSIn January 2010, a group of Santa Fe volunteers excited about the opportunity tohelp their city transition through the economic shift and reweave community inthe process launched a Time Bank. In a town known for its mañana attitude, theresponse has been phenomenal. Could this be the beginning of a new way of life?Time Banks are the brainchild of Edgar Cahn, a Yale-trained lawyer who cofoundedthe National Legal Services Program and founded the Antioch School of Law. In1980, while recuperating from a heart attack, Cahn thought up the concept ofTime Dollars as a way to redress the chronic lack of funds available to solveimportant social problems. If money was getting in the way of fulfilling needs,he reasoned, why not just make up a new currency?Time Dollars are based on the idea that everybody’s hour is equal. When I do onehour’s worth of work for Joy, I earn one Time Dollar to spend with Bob orAdrienne or Genevieve. What can be exchanged within a Time Bank is only limitedby the services its members offer. It’s similar to barter, except that I don’thave to find an immediate match for my exchange. (Time Dollars are held in trustby the software that engines the whole thing.) And it’s different from barter inthat it’s based on time and not cash value, which is why the IRS doesn’t taxTime Bank exchanges. Additionally, Time Banks can be broad or narrow in theirscope. There are examples of Time Banks that service specific populations, likepeople with disabilities, as well as specific missions, like church groups.As we help people learn about Time Banking, the idea that seems to trip them upthe most is that everybody’s hour is equal. I can’t tell you how many timespeople have asked me how many Time Dollars they should “charge” for theirservice, even when they understand the simple agreement that one hour equals onetime dollar. Sometimes that equation doesn’t feel like enough, especially ifthey have a clear understanding of what their service could earn within the casheconomy. It’s not a problem if a plumber or dentist or accountant doesn’t feelcomfortable offering their particularly valuable job skill on the Time Bank; wesimply encourage them to offer different services.Equally often, many people’s instinct is to undervalue their work. In one case,a woman was asked to make a prom dress and determined that it would take fortyhours to do so, but felt uncomfortable with what seemed to her to be such a“high price.” It could be that she had an underlying inferiority complex thatdisallowed her from equating her time and talents with another person’s, but I’msure there were other forces at work as well, not least of which is the way thatwe value goods and services in this country. In an economy flush with cheaplabor from oversees, the prices of prom dresses, out-of-season strawberries,etc., are kept artificially low. We simply don’t understand the real value ofthings anymore. Time Banking helps remind us of what our goods and servicescosts us in human terms.Time Banks also do a good job of reweaving community ties. Because our Time Bankexists alongside a cash economy, where we pay money for our plumbers, dentists,and accountants, people turn to the Time Bank for the smaller interactions thatmake us neighbors, friends, and ultimately communities—things like picking upthe mail, walking the dog, showing up with a pot of chicken soup when someone’ssick. These types of trades used to happen all the time and they forged bondsthat were valuable because they were necessary to get along. Nowadays, whenWhole Foods does our cooking, canine day care operations take over petexercising, and the internet solves the rest, we’re hard-pressed to find time tointroduce ourselves to the neighbors, let alone exchange anything with them.Time Banking becomes a set of training wheels that helps to reknit cohesivecommunities.In The Ascent of Humanity, Charles Eisenstein talks about how our ideas aboutseparation have contributed to this culture of isolation as well as how to healit. He argues that we remember and embrace a “gift culture,” in which ourpersonal gifts are expressed and shared freely. Basically, gift culture saysthat if we do what our hearts long to do and everybody else does too, the restwill take care of itself. Reciprocity is ensured by our trust in the inherentlygenerous nature of the universe. While I subscribe to this idea, I think thatTime Banks and organizations like it help people transition to that level oftrust.Why might it be hard to trust in the generous nature of the universe? Anotherway to say that a culture is organized around separation to say that it istraumatized. According to trauma author Peter Levine, of Waking the Tiger fame,one of trauma’s major characteristics is freezing, or immobility and numbness.It’s not that much of a stretch to view the typical suburban American householdin this way, where each family is sequestered in their own locked house, afraidto let their children go outside to play or to interact with their neighbors.Breaking trauma patterns isn’t easy, but organizations that provide relativelysafe arenas for interaction can surely help.Of course, Time Banks can also serve economic functions, especially in times ofcrisis. By reducing the need to pay for every little service we need, money isfreed up for things that operate exclusively within the cash economy. In SantaFe, New Mexico, we’re also hoping to enroll businesses in the Time Bank. We’renot there yet, but we envision member restaurants offering a percentage off oftheir prices for Time Bankers in exchange for helping with inventory or whateverelse they might need. The same goes for beloved venues like the LensicPerforming Arts Center, the Santa Fe Opera, and any other business that mightlike to lower its own costs and participate more closely with its community.In Portland, Maine, where the Portland Hour Exchange (PHE) is fifteen years oldand six hundred plus members strong, health care is the most utilized service,presumably helping to make up at least some of the insurance gap. They’ve alsoembraced their role as an incubator for small businesses, providing theintroductions for scores of massage therapists, interior decorators, handymen,etc., to develop crucial client lists as they first start out. We see thesemodels as being a great fit for Santa Fe or any town where the entrepreneurialspirit is strong.In one fascinating case study, the PHE received a grant to weatherize one home.Thinking ahead, they used the opportunity to train a coordinator inweatherization instead, who then trained a weatherization team, which then beganto offer weatherization services for Hour Exchangers. Members have to pay formaterials, but may use Hours for the rest. At least one team member has gone onto be hired as skilled labor by an outside weatherization business. It’s a greatexample of how Time Banking can help cushion the fall during bleaker economictimes and grease the wheels of change in the meanwhile.In less than a year, Santa Fe’s Time Bank has since grown to have over onehundred members—and more sign up every week. People’s eyes simply light up whenthey hear about Time Banking—and I know why. The truth is, we’re hungry for newways of living and relating to each other. We want to know each other and sharein each other’s lives. We feel our interconnectedness. And the organizationsthat help us to realize it are welcome."},{"pageContent":"12YOGA AND MONEYSHARON GANNONWhat would it take to be wild, free, and independently wealthy?I’m sitting in a small, dirt-floor restaurant in Bombay just finishing a meal ofyellow dhal, chapatti, mango pickle, and a bottle of Duke club soda. I get upfrom the wooden bench to walk over and pay my bill. On the brightly painted,plastered, turquoise-blue wall, above the man with the cash box waiting to takemy rupees, is an elaborately framed poster of a young woman. Around the pictureare small flashing Christmas lights. Draped across the glass are strands ofpearls. Like Botticelli’s Venus, this alluringly divine being comes into viewemerging from the water, her body gracefully curvaceous, her hair and clothesflowing unrestrictedly around her like intoxicated devotees imbibing nectarwafting from the scent of her skin. She stands upon the water perfectlybalanced, floating in an open pink lotus flower “boat” with outstretched arms,gesturing toward me. From the palms of her delicate hands flow masses oftinkling golden coins. It all looks surreal as I stand here in this dirt-floorrestaurant, flies buzzing around us all. With a huge smile and enraptured eyes,the man enthusiastically tells me, “She is my Ishtadevita—Lakshmi—the goddesswho is making the money for us!”This was my first introduction to the Hindu goddess of wealth. After that,throughout my travels in India, I began to notice many similar posters ofLakshmi (pronounced “lukshmee”), mostly in restaurants and shops; in fact,wherever business was being conducted you would likely find Lakshmi with hergenerous hands lavishly pouring money upon her devotees. I was never sure if themessage of the goddess was supposed to inspire the customers to be moregenerous, or if the shopkeepers hoped that Lakshmi herself would be generous tothem and bestow them with wealth, or if they keep her picture to remind them tobe generous to their customers and others and not to steal or cheat.The Indian sages tell us that we become whom we worship. So if to become rich isyour ambition, then to be more like Lakshmi—generous to others—would help yourealize your goal. Central to the teachings of yoga is the concept that inessence our true identity is divine. To be divine is to be whole, to be holy—notseparate from reality. My teacher, Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, described yoga asthat state where you are missing nothing—you know yourself as holy, as whole andcomplete, connected to all that is.Whatever joy there is in this world all comes from desiring others to be happy,and whatever suffering there is in this world all comes from desiring myself tobe happy at the expense of others.—Shantideva, A Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of LifeWe live in a slave culture. Our present economy is based on the domesticationand exploitation of animals and nature. We perceive all animals, as well as landand water, in terms of usefulness to us, as slaves or potential slaves—propertyto be owned. Our money comes to us as stolen wealth from the lives of theanimals we buy and sell and from the natural resources we are exhausting.Without so much as a thank you we have come to feel entitled to use the earthand all living beings as if they had no purpose other than to be used by us. Weare quickly removing all traces of wildness from the planet as we gun downmustangs from helicopters and dam “wild” rivers. If our culture had a missionstatement, it might very well read, “The Earth Belongs to Us.”We operate from a self-centered, hierarchal, dominionist worldview, which placeshuman beings above all other life forms—above the world of nature. With thisplacement we assume ownership of the earth; in fact, those of us who have enoughmoney to buy a piece of what is real—real estate—actually take legal ownershipof a piece of the earth. Ownership implies complete authority, allowing theowners to do whatever they want with whomever or whatever they own. In otherwords, we are operating from a master/slave mentality. Our whole way of life,and certainly our economy, which supports that way of life, would collapse if wedidn’t have slaves to lord over. Wealth yields power, and power is essential tothe maintenance of an exploitable relationship with others. Power that isderived from force is insatiable as well as unstable and must be constantlymaintained through aggression, and that means war.We have been at war with nature for the past ten thousand years, ever since webegan to move from living with nature to conquering and exploiting her, and thiswar has been escalating—all other wars stem from this one. The first wars in ourculture’s history were fought over disputes about animal ownership and the landneeded to confine, graze, and provide food for those animals. The word for warused by the ancient Aryans, gavya, literally means “the desire to fight for morecattle,” and gavisthi means “to be desirous of a fight.” Both words come fromthe root gav or go, which means “cow.” The domestication (enslaving) of cattleled to war. It may be interesting to note that today in the Middle East we arefighting a war for oil, and the second biggest consumers of oil in the world,second only to the military, are the meat and dairy industries.When human beings started to move away from the natural orderliness of wildnessand toward the imposed order of civilization, we became herders of animals,enslaving them and exploiting them primarily for the four m’s they couldprovide: meat, milk, manure and of course money. Animals also provide acontinued source of renewable income, because they can produce offspring—born tobe used. To exploit is to steal. In war it is expected that the losers lose whatwas once considered their own: their lives, their dignity, their freedom, theirhome, their children, etc. The word exploitation means “to treat with littleregard for the welfare, benefit or happiness of the other.” To be able tosuccessfully exploit another, it is essential that you don’t see the other aspart of yourself. Nature becomes your enemy in the quest for control andcommodification of the things of the world. So we have separated ourselves fromthe natural world by first separating ourselves from the other animals, and withthis separation came a denial that we are also animals and that we are also partof the natural world. To exploit a person you must see them as a thing, devoidof the same kinds of feelings and yearnings as you know yourself to have, so wedon’t relate to cows and pigs as people, because then it would be difficult toenslave, slaughter, and exploit them for monetary gain. In a similar way we havehad to deny that trees and other forms of life are people, because if we sawthem as persons it would be more difficult to clear cut a whole forest in orderto plant crops or build a shopping mall.History shows us that the enslavement of animals served as the model for theexploitation of the natural world as well as for human slavery. Domesticatedanimals were the first form of money, of measurable wealth exchange, whichcontinues today in the form of our stock market or stock exchange—a reference tolivestock market or livestock exchange. The word live has been dropped, becausemost of the money is made in dealing dead animals. The Latin root word forcapital is capita, which means the head of a cow, goat, or sheep—the firstanimals to be domesticated. In ancient times, the head count of the animals thata man owned determined his wealth. The roots of modern capitalism are in thoseancient enslavers, herders, and exploiters of animals. Today, no matter how faraway from the open range or from farm life we may feel ourselves to be, we arestill part of this system that was put into place thousands of years ago.But around the same time a smaller number of our ancestors did not go along withthis plan and felt that happiness and success could be attained not bydominating nature but by continuing to live in harmony with nature. Those peoplewere the first yogis. Alain Daniélou writes in his book Gods of Love andEcstasy: The Traditions of Shiva and Dionysus, “Throughout the course ofhistory, urban and industrial societies—those exploiters and destroyers of thenatural world—have been opposed to any ecological or mystical approach to theliberation of man and his happiness.” The aim of yoga practice is liberation andhappiness.If we are to survive, then we must change our viewpoint about the natural worldand not see it as just existing to provide us with money to buy stuff. If wecould allow ourselves to see that the earth is our greater heart—that we do notexist as separate from the rest of nature—we would develop a differentrelationship with the world. Yoga provides the means to do just that.Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras—a two-thousand-year-old scripture—is a manual that givesdirections for how to become free, how to become an enlightened being, a beingwho knows how to live in the present moment, beyond the limits of space andtime: a being who is eternally one with all that is—and is also ecstaticallyhappy about it! But in this ancient book there is also advice that can beapplied to the present circumstances in the world today, including the globalfinancial crisis.How one relates to others is a reoccurring theme in the Yoga Sutras. Wheneconomists talk about global communities, I do not think most of them areactually talking about global communities in the same way that a yogi would. Ayogi includes all members of the community—not just the human beings but allliving beings who may be living in the area. In other words, from a yogic pointof view, in a truly sustainable global economy, the animals, plants, and therest of nature are not seen as mere commodities. In fact, the yogi would extendthe concept of community to include the caretakers of nature, referred to in theyogic scriptures as the devas, a word meaning “godlike.” Devas are subtle spiritforms whose job it is to ensure the prosperity of the natural world. In our“modern” times it is difficult for most human beings to believe in the existenceof such beings as angels, elves, and fairies, but to the yogi who is attuned tothe workings of the natural world, these beings are as real as your next-doorneighbor. We are stealing from nature in a vain attempt to maintain and/orincrease prosperity for ourselves. According to the yogic teachings, there isgreat risk in this type of one-sided, selfish relationship with nature. VerseIII. 11 in the Bhagavad Gita says that without giving to, honoring, andcooperating with nature, humanity will not be able to exist.The idea of individual happiness being related to the happiness of the communityis not found only in the ancient yogic texts. In fields as diverse as economics,political science, mathematics, sociology, and biology, scholars and scientistshave been exploring the decision-making behavior of individuals in groups, andthey have seen that in situations where one individual’s behavior has an impacton others, the outcome improves when individuals cooperate. This is in starkcontrast to the idea put forth by Adam Smith, father of modern economics, whichsimply stated that individual ambition serves the common good—or in the pursuitof happiness, every man for himself.But the notion of cooperation is threatening to a culture that is based ondefending an individual’s right to be selfish. We are taught that in order tocreate a happy society, each individual in that society should be allowed topursue happiness for himself or herself.In the Declaration of Independence, our founding fathers put forth the ideologythat we exist so that everyone can be allowed to be free to pursue happiness. Ifwe look at our present society, we can easily conclude that we have not achievedhappiness based on this paradigm. Instead, we have reached a tipping point whereif we do not find a different way to live with each other, we may all perish.New approaches based on cooperation among living beings which include all therest of the natural world offer a radical message: in order to create a happyequilibrium in a society, each individual should only be allowed to pursuehappiness to the extent that it does not cause unhappiness to any other memberof that society, whether it be fish, bird, cow, dog, tree, river or human.All of the suffering that we experience in life, including the suffering thatcomes from financial worries about not having enough, comes from being ignorantof who we really are. We act from that ignorance when we think that what we dodoesn’t matter to the whole. In yoga, the term for that ignorance is avidya. Butwho we really are is not our personality selves encapsulated in a mortal bodyexisting separate from the rest of the natural world. People steal from othersbecause they feel deprived. Our culture teaches us that it is not reallystealing if we have the money to pay for it: if we pay for it, we have a rightto have it. But who do we think we are when we think that we could really own athing or another being or a piece of a being or a piece of land or a river?The practices of yoga are tantric practices, which help us to uncover our trueidentity and reveal to us our purpose in life—why we were born. The Sanskritword tantra is composed of two syllables: tan, which means “to stretch,” andtra, which means “to cross over.” Tantra refers to various techniques or methodsused to stretch or expand consciousness, enabling one to cross over avidya, torealize who we are through reuniting with life. The practices allow us to becomewhole—holy.One of the primary techniques used in tantra is to relate to everything andeveryone that you see as a person. This is done by putting a face on the“other.” So trees, birds, cows, sheep, wind, dogs, cats, and rivers, forinstance, become identifiable as persons. The whole world becomes alive, nolonger composed of two separate camps: you and the human beings that you knowand like, your friends and family, on the one side; and strangers, people fromother countries or even planets, people of other religions or races, and thosewho really don’t look like you and speak foreign languages that you can’tunderstand, like animals, birds, trees, plants, fairies, elemental beings,rivers, lakes, oceans—the huge panoramic world of nature—on the other side.A yogi wants to be free. Moksha means freedom. So from a yogic point of view, ifwe ourselves want to be free then it would not suit our purpose to depriveothers of their freedom by enslaving and exploiting them.In the second chapter of the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali provides practicaltips—things you can do in order insure your own freedom, health, happiness, andwealth. In regards to wealth, he suggests that if you want prosperity to appearin your life, then don’t steal from others. The actual sutra is:asteya-pratishthayam sarva-ratnopasthanam (YS II.37). Asteya (pronounced“ah-stay-ya”) means not to steal, and the whole sutra means, “When one stopsstealing from others, prosperity appears.” If we do not deny others theirprosperity, prosperity will not be denied to us.The Yoga Sutras also has something to say about greed. Success in our culture ismeasured in capital gain. Our importance as individuals is measured by ourwealth, and wealth comes from owning things and controlling others. Greed andhoarding are not only accepted as normal, they are encouraged as an indicationof prosperity. To live simply so that others may simply live is a radicalconcept to embrace; yet in the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali tells us that the practiceof greedlessness is extremely powerful—so powerful that it can reveal to us thereason we were born, our purpose in life. The actual sutra is:aparigraha-sthairye janma-kathamta-sambodhah (YS II.39). The Sanskrit word forthis practice is aparigraha (pronounced “ah-par-ree-gra-ha”), and it meansgreedlessness—not taking more than one needs—and the whole sutra means, “Whenone becomes selfless and ceases to take more than one needs, one obtainsknowledge of why one was born.” Real needs are not wrong; wants, on the otherhand, can become problematic. We are in the midst of a global crisis caused byinsatiable human greed. We have consumed far more than we need. The consequencesfor the survival of many animal species, as well as our own, are dire. There hasnever been so much poverty in the world. The more we have, the more we want.Influenced by media imagery and advertising, we have become habituated to lookoutside ourselves for happiness and in the process have created powerfuladdictions that drive our choices. Each time we allow an outside stimulus toprogram our actions, we allow our own inner power of intelligent discriminationto atrophy, leading to further addiction. Many of us have become so out of touchwith our innermost selves that we do not know where need ends and want begins.The directive aparigraha, in contrast, helps one to curb one’s actions inaccordance with what is beneficial for all. We begin to understand ourselves asbeings who thrive as part of a whole organism working together, and we begin tofeel our unique contribution to the wholeness of life. In our culture we havebeen told that we as individuals don’t have to take responsibility for ouractions, because our individual actions don’t matter much to the whole, muchless to ourselves. But they do matter; in fact, they are the most important anddefining aspect of how our own destiny and future world will be shaped.But how can we know when we are taking more than we need? How can we know whenour needs have become excessive wants, and what is enough? Is greed really thatevil? If you look up the word evil in the dictionary, you will find that itcomes from the Germanic root word übel, which means “up” or “over,” meaning togo beyond the limits of what is helpful. In other words, that which is excessiveis evil. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, over fifty-twobillion animals are killed by human beings for food worldwide every year. Thereare only six and a half billion human beings on the planet. Our presentexploitation of animals and the natural world is excessive, and by thedictionary definition that means it is also evil. We don’t kill animals becausewe are hungry. We kill them to make money so that we can buy stuff—most of whichwe don’t even need or want. I once read that 85 percent of everything bought inan American shopping mall ends up in a landfill within two weeks after purchase.How does the yogic practice of greedlessness result in the realization of one’spurpose in life? To be greedy and to hoard comes from being afraid of not havingenough in the future. We have become bound by linear time. We spend our lives inregretful or longing memories of the past and hope and fears about the future.We have learned to “stock” pile surplus from our ancestors, who taught us toenslave and exploit animals and nature and the commodities we force them toproduce. When we let go of the habit of accumulating money and material things,we might have a chance to drop into the present. It is in the present that ourtrue multidimensional self exists, and when we allow ourselves to be present wewill find ourselves—our destiny will be revealed. Eternity is happening now—now,in the present moment. To drop into the present moment one must allow for a moreflexible or open-ended relationship to time as well as to space. By letting goof attachments to material things, this will be more possible. It is the fear oflosing and the subsequent habit of hoarding that keeps us bound to linear timeand blocks us from entering into the eternal now.We are on the brink of an apocalypse that some have prophesied will result in aradical shift in how we relate to time. The Greek word apocalypse means “toreveal; to uncover; to stand naked, exposed without artifice, clothing orpossessions.” This present age or time, or yuga, has been spoken of in Hinduscripture as the Kali Yuga. Kali is derived from the Sanskrit word kala, meaning“time.” Some say that in the year 2012, there will be an end to time as we havebeen conditioned by our culture to relate to it. Civilized men and women areafraid of the present and instead cling to the past and the future. Naturethrives in the present. Wild beings live in the present moment.We have robbed domesticated animals of their wildness and made themslaves—victims of our greed-based economic system—and because we are interwovenwith the web of life, we ourselves cannot escape from the repercussion of ouractions upon others. We have also become domesticated and see ourselves asvictims of our own system. Many of us in our culture are so dependent upon“others in high places” to take care of us that when we become afraid of nothaving enough, we blame our “masters” (parents, landlords, employers,corporations, government—i.e., those with whom we do business), as if we did notknow how to take care of our own needs. We too often deny that we ourselves hadany hand in our misfortunes. We like to insist it was someone else who causedthe trouble in our lives, so we become complainers. We have given away ourpower, and in exchange we have become powerless, needy and afraid of the future.We get our food from the supermarket and our money to buy that food from a bossor corporation. We live in fear of being fired or laid off from our jobs. Whenwe are sick we pay a doctor to write a prescription, which we take to a drugstore to buy medicine. As we have domesticated animals, we have allowedourselves to become domesticated, and with that domestication comes adisconnection from intelligence and intuition. We have compromised our naturalinstincts and senses and become crude, dull, and bored. We need constantentertainment to feel that our lives are worthwhile (or “worthwild”—meaningworth the wild that we have given up). Wild beings know how to take care ofthemselves. They know how to provide food and medicine for themselves and theirchildren. They are “independently wealthy,” as they are dependent inwardly fortheir knowledge; they look into the depths of their own souls—that unseen placewhere all of life is joined and time is eternal. A wild being would not causethe mass destruction of others for such silly compensation as a few dollars. Thekarmic costs are too great, and no amount of money could compensate for beingdisconnected from the living world, the source of vitality itself. Perhaps wildbeings realize more than we do the multidimensional complexities of reality andhow what we do to others we do to ourselves, because we are not separate fromothers. Wild beings live in harmony with the natural world. We could too. Wecould take our place with nature and become whole. But it would mean that wewould have to get a little wild and begin to see ourselves in others—to see sodeeply that otherness disappears and we come to know ourselves as holy, as partof the whole—the whole mysterious scheme of life. What a great relief it wouldbe to let go of so much artifice and pretension that we ourselves have allowedto be imposed upon us for so many thousands of years. No need for money. No needto buy things, because we have ceased to see the world as made of things.Instead we have opened our eyes to the wonder of life and see it peopled with avast diversity of living beings—people like ourselves, not things to service us,or to be used, bought, and sold. Like our animal brethren, we have becomeindependently wealthy.I would like to conclude with an excerpt from an essay by Andrei Codresculamenting the opening of a new Burger King restaurant:Someone [said] that the reason we treat animals so badly is because they don’thave any money. We treat children badly for the same reason, though we don’t eatthem. Perhaps the time has come for animals to get paid for what they do.Perhaps the time has come for us to eat our children. Or maybe we should justtear down the Burger Kings.1 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts001]"},{"pageContent":"13THE INTENTIONAL ECONOMYDANIEL PINCHBECKWhile exploring shamanism and non-ordinary states, I discovered the power ofintention. According to the artist Ian Lungold, who lectured brilliantly aboutthe Mayan calendar before his untimely death in 2005, the Maya believe that yourintention is as essential to your ability to navigate reality as your positionin time and space. If you don’t know your intention, or if you are operatingwith the wrong intentions, you are always lost, and can only get more dissolute.This idea becomes exquisitely clear during psychedelic journeys, when your stateof mind gets intensified and projected kaleidoscopically all around you. As ourcontemporary world becomes more and more psychedelic, we are receiving harshlessons in the power of intention on a vast scale. Over the last decades, theinternational financial elite manipulated the markets to create obscene rewardsfor themselves at the expense of poor and middle class people across the world.Using devious derivatives, cunning CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), andother trickery, they siphoned off ever-larger portions of the surplus valuecreated by the producers of real goods and services, contriving a debt-basedeconomy that had to fall apart. Their own greed—such a meager, dull intent—hasnow blown up in their faces, annihilating, in slow motion, the corrupt systembuilt to serve them.Opportunities such as the current economic meltdown don’t come along very oftenand should be seized once they appear. When the edifice of mainstream societysuddenly collapses, as is happening now, it is a fantastic time for artists,visionaries, mad scientists, and seers to step forward and present awell-defined alternative. What is required, in my opinion, is not some moderateproposal or incremental change, but a complete shift in values and goals, makinga polar reversal of our society’s basic paradigm. If our consumer-based,materialism-driven model of society is dissolving, what can we offer in itsplace? Why not begin with the most elevated intentions? Why not offer the mostimaginatively fabulous systemic redesign?The fall of capitalism and the crisis of the biosphere could induce mass despairand misery, or they could impel the creative adaptation and conscious evolutionof the human species. We could attain a new level of wisdom and build acompassionate global society in which resources are shared equitably while wedevote ourselves to protecting threatened species and repairing damagedecosystems. Considering the lightning-like pace of global communication and newsocial technologies, this change could happen with extraordinary speed.To a very great extent, the possibilities we choose to realize in the futurewill be a result of our individual and collective intention. For instance, if wemaintain a puritanical belief that work is somehow good in and of itself, thenwe will keep striving to create a society of full employment, even if those jobsbecome “green collar.” A more radical viewpoint perceives most labor assomething that could become essentially voluntary in the future. The proper useof technology could allow us to transition to a post-scarcity leisure society,in which the global populace spends its time growing food, building community,making art, making love, learning new skills, and deepening self-developmentthrough spiritual disciplines such as yoga, tantra, shamanism, and meditation.One common perspective is that the West and Islam are engaged in an intractableconflict of civilizations, and the hatred and terrorism can only get worse.Another viewpoint could envision the Judeo-Christian culture of the West findingcommon ground and reconciling with the esoteric core, the metaphysical purity,of the Islamic faith. It seems—to me anyway—that we could find solutions to allof the seemingly intractable problems of our time once we are ready to apply adifferent mindset to them. As Einstein and others have noted, we don’t solveproblems through employing the type of thinking that created them, but ratherdissolve them when we reach a different level of consciousness.We became so mired in our all-too-human world that we lost touch with the other,elder forms of sentience all around us. Along with delegates to the UN, perhapswe could train cadres of diplomats to negotiate with the vegetal, fungal, andmicrobial entities that sustain life on earth? The mycologist Paul Stametsproposes that we create a symbiosis with mushrooms to detoxify ecosystems andimprove human health. The herbalist Morgan Brent believes psychoactive floralike ayahuasca and peyote are “teacher plants,” sentient emissaries fromsuper-intelligent nature, trying to help the human species find its niche in thegreater community of life. When we pull back to study the hapless and shamefulactivity of our species across the earth, these ideas do not seem veryfar-fetched.In fact, the breakdown of our financial system has not altered the amount oftangible resources available on our planet. Rather than trying to rejigger anunjust debt-based system that artificially maintains inequity and scarcity, wecould make a new start. We could develop a different intention for what we aresupposed to be doing together on this swiftly tilting planet, and institute newsocial and economic infrastructure to support that intent."},{"pageContent":"14AN ARMY OF JACKS TO FIGHT THE POWERPETER LAMBORN WILSONIn fairy tales, humans can possess exterior souls, things magically containingor embodying individual life force—stone, egg, ring, bird or animal, etc. If thething is destroyed, the human dies. But while the thing persists, the humanenjoys a kind of immortality or at least invulnerability.Money can be seen as such an exteriorized soul. Humans created it, in somesense, in order to hide their souls in things that could be locked away (intower or cave) and hidden so their bodies would acquire magical invulnerability:wealth, health, enjoyment, and power over enemies—even over fate.But these exterior souls need not be hidden away—they can be divided almostindefinitely and circulated, exchanged for desire, passed on to heirs like animmortal virus—or rather like a dead thing that magically contains life and“begets” itself endlessly in usury. It constitutes humanity’s one really totallysuccessful experiment in magic: no one calls the bluff, and after six thousandyears, it seems like nature. (In fact, an old Chinese cosmogonic text claimedthe two basic principles of the universe are water and money.)It’s worth noting that in märchen, or folktales, the characters with externalsouls are often the villains. Clearly, the practice must appear uncanny to anynormal society, in which magic (call it collective consciousness in active mode)is channeled through ritual and custom to the life of all—not the aggrandizementof one against all (black magic or witchcraft). Yet in the form of money, theexterior soul, shattered into fragments, is put into circulation but alsostolen, monopolized, and guarded by dragons—so that some unlucky humans can bestripped of all soul, while others gorge or hoard up soul-bits of ancestors andvictims in their ghoulish caves or “banks.”The beloved in the tale may also have an exterior soul. It falls into the graspof the evil sorcerer or dragon and must be rescued. In other words, desire,which is alienated (reified, fetishized) in the form of a symbolic object, canonly be restored to its true fate (love) by reappropriation from theexpropriator, stealing it back from the wizard. The task falls to “Jack,” thethird and youngest, sometimes an orphan or disinherited, possibly a fool, apeasant with more heart than any prince, generous, bold, and lucky.Exactly the same story can be seen acted out in every honest ethnographic reporton the introduction of money into some pre-monetary tribal economy. Even withoutthe usual means of force, terror, oppression, colonialist imperialism, ormissionary zeal, money alone destroys every normal culture it touches.CARGO CULTS AND GHOST DANCESInterestingly, in nearly every case, some sort of messianic movement, cargocult, or Ghost Dance–type resistance movement springs up within a generation ortwo after first alien contact. These cults invariably make appeal to spirits (oreven demons when circumstances really begin to deteriorate) for the power toovercome money, to “provide good things” without recourse to the black magic ofmoney and the vampirization of other peoples’ external souls—to combat themalignancy of wealth that is not shared.This is a major trope in all the tales. Jack gives away part of his last loafprecisely to the power-animal or shaman or old lady with the very gift he’llneed in his quest, but he gives unwittingly, not in expectation of exchange.Jack always stands for what Karl Polanyi and Marcel Mauss call the economy ofthe gift.A great many fairy tales must have originated in “folk memories” of earliernonhierarchal social structures, embodied in narrative (myth) and ritual, andgiven focus during the period when this ancient polity was threatened andfinally overcome by later or alien systems—particularly by money, by the coinsthat always appear in these tales.Pierre-Joseph Proudhon believed that people originally invented money a means topry loose and force into circulation the hoarded wealth of the “dragon,” theoppressor class. This idea has interesting resonances.It points to the fact that for “the people,” money in hand represents notoppression but pleasure, gratified desire. Money may not be the root of allevil, but given the existence of money, “love of money” is quite natural.Alchemy epitomizes this jouissance of money in the fairy tale concept oftransmutation, production of gold without labor as a free gift of nature to herlovers: Jove’s body as a shower of golden coins.As a stand-in for “the people,” Jack wins the treasure, but in doing so removesits curse, its dragonish malignancy, because in him the treasure finds itsrightful end in happiness (i.e., free distribution, the gift). Hence, the greatfeast that ends so many tales, and the wedding between peasant lad and princessthat levels distinctions and restores external souls to their bodies.But Proudhon’s notion is contradicted by myth, which attributes the invention ofcoins to a king—not Croesus of Lydia, who actually did invent coins (seventhcentury BC), but Midas, who choked on magical gold, his externalized soul.Dionysus and Silenus gave him his wish and then saved him by revoking it,allowing him to vomit all the gold into the river Pactolus in Phrygia.The historical Midas lived in the eighth century BC, and Phrygia is not far fromLydia, where rivers also ran with gold and electrum and coins first appeared astemple tokens. Coins may seem to regain their innocence when they are spentrather than hoarded, but in fact just at this moment they betray us by leavingus and never returning. In the end, all coins end up in the usurer’s vault.Money is already debt. It says so on the U.S. one-dollar bill, that encyclopediaof hermetic imagery and secret doctrine of money.JACK NEVER REALLY WINSJack’s triumph lies not in the “ever after,” but only in a moment that isforever remembered and invoked as lost. Obviously Jack never really wins,otherwise we wouldn’t call these stories fairy tales and relegate them to thenursery, the savage pre-monetary world of mere childhood. The idea that märchencontain esoteric teachings on economics will probably sound ridiculous, but onlyto those who’ve never really read them with Polanyi’s or Mauss’s economicanthropology in mind.The old Russian cycle (Jack = Ivan) strikes me as particularly sensitive to thisaspect of the material, almost as if socialism had a subconscious pre-echo inthe great Russian fairy tale collections of the early 1900s.Among the uniquely Slavic motifs of this cycle, everyone loves the tales of BabaYaga, the little house on great chicken legs that walks and moves wherever thewicked witch desires. The image’s power involves implications that Baba Yagafunctions not only as the witch’s house, but also as her external soul. It isboth shield and weapon, space and motion, cave and magic carpet. I can’t helpthinking of it as a symbol of capital itself, especially in its purely magicalend phase in the global era. The Baba Yaga might be an offshore bank ready topull up stakes and flee to some freer market or a shoe factory on its way toMexico.Speaking of Mexico reminds me of a story about the Mexican Revolution: around1910, thousands of North American anarchists, Wobblies, and adventurers crossedthe border under false generic names to join Pancho Villa or the Magonistas andthus came to be called the “Army of Smiths.”Given the proliferation and gigantism of Baba Yaga in our times, perhaps what weneed is an Army of Jacks."},{"pageContent":"15ONE THOUSAND WORDS ABOUT WHERE FREE MUSIC IS TAKING USPAUL D. MILLER,AKA DJ SPOOKY THAT SUBLIMINAL KIDI can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of theold ones.—John CageIn a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuermust first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower mustalways hold a lead …—Aristotle, PhysicsWarning: This text contains uncredited samples. The smart reader is advised tosearch online for terms in various sentences to find out the context. Simplytype them into a decent search engine, and see what else pops up in the browser.Begin: These days, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we’re facedwith a kind of social entropy. Whenever one is exposed to the financial worldthere’s a kind of surrealism to the situation. Credit default swaps, futuresmarkets, abstract financial instruments: these are terms based on complex,expensive loans that most people don’t understand. But what makes all of thisconverge on the topic I’m writing about—“economics” as it relates to culturalproduction—is a kind of pro forma switch between artistic practice and how theworld is represented. Think of it this way: economics, the “dismal science,” isfor most people the “real” of the real, the financial underpinnings of modernlife in an information based economy. Let’s take a look at the root ofeconomics: eco is derived from the Greek term oikonomia (oikos—“house” andnomos—“custom”). It’s resonant with the later Latin-derived term credit, derivedfrom creder, which simply means “to believe.”This is exactly what the founder of modern economics, Adam Smith, meant when hesaid “all money is a matter of belief.” Or even more when he said “on the roadfrom the City of Skepticism, I had to pass through the Valley of Ambiguity.”What kind of music comes out of these statements?Let’s put it this way: the absolute top-selling album of all time is the blankCD. More than the Beatles, more than Elvis, Bob Marley, or Michael Jackson—I’mtalking about the simple utilitarian object of the humble 700 megabyte CD. Why?Here’s the basic scenario: when you face the idea that digital reproductionequals infinite abundance, the result is that you have so many options availablethat the normal business model of scarcity simply no longer applies. And somusic should be, could be, and will be free. It’s that simple. Infinite amountof copies equals zero value. You resequence, resplice, and redice the materialsof your audio or video archive because your individual choice is what gives thesituation a robust and deeply personal satisfaction. The consumer is sovereignin this scenario, and the cultural producer becomes content for the palette ofthe consumer. The abundance of music, its low cost, and its widespreadavailability contribute to the sense that all music from every part of recordedhistory is equally available, and can be mixed together into new forms. In anetworked economy, the simplest of terms: anything that can be digital, will be.And that scenario, in turn, fosters the end of normal economics in the cultureindustry—that’s the real freakonomics. And no, I don’t have any nostalgia forthe old music industry model of the album—it was always an artificial constructto boost profits for the major record labels. Music was better when people hadto put more creative intent into the single. But I do think that the vinyl LPwill outlast CDs precisely because it’s got collectors appeal—it’s become scarcein a way that fosters real value.In the twenty-first century we face so many variables about what it means to“believe” in a system: a computer operating system? A church? A “lifestyle?” Ilove to play with these kinds of conjunctions, because, put simply, that’s aboutall that makes any of this make sense: it’s all a kind of theater, a place wherewe create roles, and read from a script made of numbers that many of us don’tunderstand. Ask your average person on the street—we in the United States face ascenario anticipated by Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s 1987 film Wall Street,who sneers at the belief of the audience in morality, and simply says, “90percent of Americans have no net worth.” Almost true …If we go back a little ways, and think this idea through, we come up with somedifferent issues. What some economists are calling “social capital” comes intoplay; it gives a sense of dynamism to the way we think about “intangible goods”and comes into direct collision with the norms of a capitalist society based onscarcity. Got it? It’s been a while since 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. If weturn things upside down and think about the “values system” of Americancapitalism versus, say, what’s going on in post-Mao China, we can see thingslooking like this: In 1989 the claim was made that what had been defeated wasnot an enemy—the Soviet Union—but rather the entire opposition to capitalism. Atthe time neoliberal author Francis Fukuyama argued that the world had reached“the end of history,” because from that point on there will only be capitalismand continuous growth, unrestrained by annoying things like federal regulation,etc. You can see where that got us. Ask Lehman Brothers, Bernie Madoff, oranyone else involved with the financial fictions of the Bush era.Recall and rewind: The script of our era is what theorist Arjun Appadurai likesto call the “social life of things,” or what philosopher Alain Badiou has simplycalled “theory of the subject.” We reflect, we generate intangible links andconnections between tastes, styles, and above all, the way we combine thosetastes and styles. That’s the catch with digital media and music; there is no“there”—everything is routed between connections, and end points are materialfor the scrapheap of postmodernity.Post-everything music asks this: Why pay for anything? Why not just create thegift economy that we all live in and call it quits? The way the law is written,and the way we live, simply part ways. I tend to think of sampling and uploadingfiles as the same thing, just different formats—to paraphrase John Cage, soundis just information in a different form. The old world production model,scarcity, always seemed annoying and physical. I want to see people’simaginations take flight; they should create their own values, and a soundtrackto go with it, to inspire new forms for new ways of living. To get rid of thetwentieth century’s old physical forms, and to become an emotive, free space.That’s the basic idea for twenty-first-century aesthetics—here and now, asalways. Dig?Finance of fictions. Fictions of finance. How does music factor into thisentertainment industry? What’s the matter with finance? Start with the fact thatthe modern financial industry generates huge profits and paychecks, yet deliversfew tangible benefits.Remember when Wall Street’s Gordon Gekko declared, “Greed is good”? By today’sstandards, Gekko was a piker. In the years leading up to the 2008 crisis, thefinancial industry accounted for a third of total domestic profits—about twiceits share two decades earlier.These profits were justified, we were told, because the industry was doing greatthings for the economy. It was channeling capital to productive uses; it wasspreading risk; it was enhancing financial stability. None of that was true.Capital was channeled not to job-creating innovators, but into an unsustainablehousing bubble; risk was concentrated, not spread; and when the housing bubbleburst, the supposedly stable financial system imploded, with the worst globalslump since the Great Depression as collateral damage.For most of us these days, the fact is that much of the financial industry hasbecome synonymous with the term racket—a game in which a handful of people arelavishly paid to mislead and exploit consumers and investors—but which alsocomes from a humorously resonant term that simply means “to make a lot ofnoise.” I love to think about credit, finance, and noise as terms that lendthemselves to systems of belief—tuning systems, harmony of markets, and utopianderivatives. Stuff like that. And if we don’t lower the boom on these practices,the racket will just go on. That is what I mean when I say free music. Bring thenoise.

These are whatattract attention. Black Rock City, as many of you know, is a hyperconnectiveenvironment. It’s full of interactive art. It’s very antic and it’s a lot offun. But I’ve decided to focus here on economics, the dismal science, because,in the end, doesn’t everything come down to economics, of one kind or another? Iwill begin by quoting an almost forgotten author, Richard Jefferies. Hiswritings belong to a British literary genre called “country writing” thatflourished in the nineteenth century. In “Absence of Design in Nature: TheProdigality of Nature and the Niggardliness of Man,” Jefferies talks about thelaw of natural increase, which describes the propensity of living things toreproduce themselves at exponential rates: “There is no ‘enough’ in nature. Itis one vast prodigality. It is a feast. There is no economy: it is all oneimmense extravagance. It is all giving, giving, giving: no saving, no penury; agolden shower of good things forever descending.” Contrast this with thematerial economy of our world, in which each individual is in order to exist,compelled to labor, save, and compete with other people for control andpossession of scarce resources. Such is the iron law of economics in our world:the superabundance of nature and the utter niggardliness of man.This is the contrast he draws. It is as if we’ve fallen out of some happy Edeninto a world where we must hoard and struggle to wrest what we can from theuniverse and one another. But I am more hopeful than Jefferies. He was writingabout both nature and society in the midst of the first great phase of theIndustrial Revolution, a time of massive social dislocation and widespreadpoverty. Think Dickens. The folkways of rural England and the networks ofcommunal obligation that once sustained it were being brutally uprooted by themarketplace. An anonymous mass society was taking shape, and Jefferies came tofeel that the factories and enormous cities of our industrial age represented aprinciple of evil and selfishness. But I have had the opportunity to observe avery different kind of city with a very different kind of economy, and I’ve cometo see that there is more of nature in the social world of human beings than heor any of us today have yet understood.I’m thinking, of course, about Burning Man and Black Rock City, the civic entitywe annually create in the Black Rock Desert. I would like to start by describingthe most radical and under-reported aspect of our city. It is under-reportedbecause it’s so very foreign to our current way of life. Reporters simply can’tperceive it most of the time, because it just doesn’t fit with what we’re usedto. They see a vitally creative world, filled with a superabundance of art,animated by an electric spirit, and full of a whole lot of eccentric andentertaining behavior. That’s the big story that gets reported.But if they peel off the onion skin and peer a bit closer, there is anotherstory. They will find that Black Rock City is one of the most public-spiritedplaces on earth. We have, for instance, an incredible rate of volunteerism. Wedid a poll on the internet recently and the results were astonishing: 84.7percent of our citizens contribute some form of volunteer service to our city. Ichallenge anyone to find another city in America that can equal that. We’re theseventh-largest city in Nevada for eight days, and our crime rate is negligible.Think what the police blotter in New Orleans during Mardi Gras must look like.And Black Rock City is a party that’s certainly equal to that in intensity. Weare also committed to a Leave No Trace effort. We say Burning Man is adisappearing act: we miracle up an entire city, it lasts for one week, and thenit absolutely disappears. And I mean everything disappears: every sequin, everyboa feather, every cigarette butt, and especially those damn pistachionutshells. Our cleanup crews work hard, but our organization couldn’t possiblycope with this task if it wasn’t for the public spirit of our citizens. Thereare no trash cans in our city, yet our citizens take the responsibility to packout their own trash. That’s almost inconceivable, but that’s what happens inBlack Rock City.And that’s one of the problems reporters have. Burning Man is this wild andabandoned party on the one hand, and it’s the most public-spirited city inAmerica on the other. And this leads to a kind of cognitive dissonance. Itdoesn’t make any sense to them, and that’s because they don’t understand thereally big story, the story that lies behind all of this which is the cause ofthese two things conjoining. And the reason this doesn’t get reported is becauseit’s profoundly foreign to our current way of life.The essential cause of all this is the giving of gifts. We’ve intentionallydesigned Black Rock City to foster a gift economy. We allow no vending, noadvertising, no buying or selling of anything. We discourage bartering becauseeven bartering is a commodity transaction. Instead, we’ve originated both anethos and an economic system devoted to the giving of gifts. This is a radicaldeparture from the marketplace because, of course, the marketplace invades everycrack and corner of our lives today. A gift economy is founded on principlesthat are diametrically opposed to those that dominate our consumer culture.Let me draw a contrast between the market and a gift economy. The value of athing in the marketplace is based on its scarcity in relation to demand. Andcapitalism itself is based on the competition to acquire the scarce resource ofmoney. The great utility of this system is that an organized market servesindividual desire. A simple act of purchase allows me to command the resourcesof the world. With a single expenditure, the magnesium of South Africa, the oilof Arabia, and the labor of China can be fetched from around the globe anddelivered into my hands as if by magic; all that’s required of me is a sum ofmoney. There has never been a better method for the productive allocation ofwealth and the distribution of goods and services. As a result, we live today ina large-scale global economy that continues to expand into every area of humanactivity. Adam Smith, many years ago, rightly regarded this as a kind ofmiracle. The market, mated today with our modern system of mass production andmass distribution, has produced more wealth and distributed it more widely thanin all other epochs of human history. This has liberated us from toil, but moreimportantly, it has freed us to pursue uniquely personal visions of happiness.At least, this is the version of our modern market that is constantly extolledin our society. But this economic revolution that has occurred so recently inhuman history has a darker side. The social contract we have signed contains ahidden clause and we have failed to read the fine print. And this is because thevery virtues of our system represent its liabilities. The great efficiency ofthe marketplace depends on the fluidity of value as it flows in one form ofcommodity to another. If I buy something from you, no relationship and no moralconnection is left to relate us to one another. The value of the money I havespent speeds on to take new forms as further goods and services. This is thefuel that powers our economy and produces a flow of never-ending capital aroundthe world.But what this transaction does not produce is connections between people. Itdoes not produce what Robert Putnam has described as “social capital.” Socialcapital represents the sum of human connection that holds a society together,and it is fostered by networks of personal relationships. In Bowling Alone, heobjectively charts what all of us intuitively know: the social capital ofAmerica has begun to disintegrate.Putnam talks about two kinds of social capital. First, there is “bonding” socialcapital. This consists of our intimate ties with our family and friends,communal relationships with that circle of people you know well. It doesn’tconsist of more than one hundred people because you can’t keep up intimaterapport with over one hundred people. And these circles tend to be exclusive.Not intentionally, but when you are huddled with your friends, you turn yourback on the world and it’s hard to let the stranger in.Another form of social capital called “bridging” social capital. This refers tolooser ties within a broader social circle that encompasses larger networks. Itcould be people you meet at parties or at work, people you exchange cards with.Here’s the difference: if you get sick and you need chicken soup, you’ll callsomeone you are bonded to because they’ll care. On the other hand, if you getfired and need a job, you are probably not going to talk to your brother or yourclose pal. You’re going to talk to someone who is part of that bridging networkbecause they are connected to an extended network that moves out into the world.This might be a group of people who get together to play cards or hold softballgames. More formally, it might consist of civic organizations or other sorts ofclubs. As a rule, these groups are inclusive. Anyone who is interested can gainentry. You don’t need an intimate tie with other members. If you’re interestedin making ships in bottles, anyone is welcome who wants to make ships inbottles.Putnam found that in America today, bonding social capital is eroding rapidly.The average American household spends seven hours a day watching television. Alot of people just turn the TV on to listen to the laugh track so they feel thatthey are not alone. The average American household possesses 2.4 televisionsets. And that means that husbands, wives, teenagers, and toddlers are allwatching television independently of one another. If you could take the roof offthe average suburban home, you would see each family member in a separate roomwatching a TV that has a separate set of commercials on it hawking a separatelifestyle. And if you looked more closely, you’d see that they’re surrounded,barricaded, by all this stuff they’ve bought to support these lifestyles thatare being sold to them. This is hardly connective: 81 percent of Americans saythey spend most evenings watching TV, but only 56 percent report that they talkto family members.There are more cars in America than there are drivers, and 90 percent of ourcitizens drive to work alone. In 1992, we each spent nineteen hours per yearstuck in traffic jams. We each spent forty hours stuck in traffic in 1997, andI’m sure it’s more than that now. So here you have an entire nation on thefreeway, trapped in the metal carapace of an automobile, isolated from everybodyaround them. I think I’m an affable guy. I think I bond with other people. Butwhen I get into a car I become demonic. “You jerk! Cut me off?!?!?” You knowwhat’s pathetic? Putnam found that people report they like being in their carduring these long commutes because it’s a time to think. To think, as they sitin these isolation booths cursing their fellow citizens! Here’s anotherstatistic: Putnam has found that each additional ten minutes of daily commutingreduces involvement in community affairs by 10 percent.This leads us to an even darker picture. For when we get to bridging socialcapital, we find that membership in clubs and civic organizations has fallen byhalf since 1975. He calls his book Bowling Alone because bowling leagues, whichare a form of bridging social capital, have declined so precipitously that, ifyou follow the curve, in another ten years everyone—even though there is a retrofashion in bowling—could be bowling alone. This pattern also applies to moreformal organizations: organizations that do good works in the world, like theLions or the Kiwanis.At the back of the book he features charts that are really quite fascinating.Chart after chart crests at the height of civic involvement in America in thelast century, around 1950, and then starts a decline until it reaches a pointabout twenty years ago, and then it makes a beeline for the drain. It resemblesone of those mass die-offs when asteroids hit the earth, and that is what ishappening to the civic tissue of our country.I think we all know what some of the causes for this are: TV, cars, metropolitansprawl. In a land of megamalls, cineplexes, gated communities, anonymous fastfood outlets, and retail chain stores it’s difficult to connect with anyone oranything. I was born in 1948, and I have seen all of these changes over the spanof my lifetime.But I think if we take a larger view and look at the character of modern-daycapitalism, we can diagnose an even more essential cause. It is in the nature ofour mass marketing to cater to the desires of the individual. Indeed, it’s notsurprising that the social ills Putnam describes have accelerated during thelast twenty years, because it’s during this period that capitalism has perfectedmany marketing techniques isolating us even more radically from one another.Marketers have identified thousands of new market niches allowing manufacturersto gratify each sector of the population. In other words, we have been sorted byage, class, and income much as cattle might be herded into stalls within afeedlot. And the best minds of our generation aren’t writing books likePutnam’s, they’re doing market research and working for ad agencies.When parents, teenagers, and toddlers are planted in front of differenttelevision sets the commercials they watch do not provide them with a way oflife. They merely offer commodities that are presented in such a way that theysimulate states of being, which is the sin of simony: an unhallowed traffickingin sacred things. Whereas the only thing I know that is sacred is the immediateexperience of being, of belonging to your self, belonging to others, belongingto the world, belonging to the cosmos. And all this stuff that we acquire standsbetween us and the world beyond ourselves. It muffles our being. The spiritualdamage caused by living this way has worked the greatest evil in our world.In a final statistic, Putnam finds that Americans born and raised in theseventies and eighties are three or four times more likely to commit suicide aspeople of the same age at the middle of the last century. If you are a latchkeykid and you’re watching TV in your separate room, and your only way of belongingto other people is through stuff that simulates your being, and you’re feelingreally lonely, you might be willing to kill yourself.Well, having painted for you a rather dismal picture of what became wrong withour world, let me now return to the gift economy of Burning Man and Black RockCity. Gifts are very good conductors of social capital. Let me illustrate. If Igive you a gift, this represents a personal gesture. It is a bonding experience,unlike buying something from someone, where the great convenience is that wearen’t connected. In a market transaction people who are party to it feel nofurther sense of human obligation. But interactions based on gifting operatequite differently. In the words of Lewis Hyde, who wrote a wonderful book calledThe Gift, “When gifts circulate within a group, their commerce leaves a seriesof interconnected relationships in its wake, and a kind of decentralizedcohesiveness emerges.” What he’s saying is that in a gift economy everybodybegins to feel like they belong to one another. Value passes from person toperson, from heart to heart. To put this another way, gifts are bearers ofbeing. Think about a gift that you loved giving. Didn’t it feel as though italready belonged to the person you gave it to? Didn’t it feel as if it was justflowing through you?Black Rock City is devoted to the giving of all sorts of things, the sharing ofsurvival resources, interactive artwork, and our public service roles. The wholetissue of our city is one vast gift. If you look at our budget it amounted tofive million dollars in 2001. But if you want to understand what makes our citycome alive as a civic entity, then look at the gifts that all our people give tous. It would run into the millions. I cannot begin to estimate it. We’veactually created much of our civic infrastructure out of gifts. Volunteers greetevery person who comes into our city, they police the environment, and theylight the lamps that illuminate Black Rock City.But I particularly want to call attention to a special kind of gift we call atheme camp, because it best illustrates the gift-giving process. This beginswith what we call radical self-expression. We ask participants to commune withthemselves and to regard their own reality, that essential inner portion ofexperience that makes them feel real, as if it were a vision or a gift, and thenproject this vision out onto the world. Now artists have been doing that for along time. And it is an almost irresistible impulse out there in the Black RockDesert because the environment is a blank slate. You can project your innervision out onto the world as if you were projecting a movie. That is what makesradical self-expression so radical.Along with radical self-expression comes radical self-reliance. Most of ourcitizens pool survival resources—they have to. They must prepare to survive inreally drastic wilderness conditions: one-hundred-degree temperatures,hundred-mile-an-hour winds. And what tends to happen is that people respondcommunally. They form organized groups and someone says you bring the shelter,you bring the food, you bring the boa feathers, and we’ll survive together. Andwe didn’t tell them to do this. They realized that they had to form bondingsocial capital in order to survive. That’s how cultures developed originally,you know. They developed an ethos and a sense of belonging because people had toshare resources and struggle to survive together in the world not like theeconomy of convenience that we live in today.Now we don’t dictate the content of radical self-expression in the theme camps,but we create the societal vessel that helps to contain this creative,interactive, utterly uncontrollable process. We’ve created a few simple rules.We’ve said a theme camp must function as a public environment that is accessibleto other people whom one doesn’t know, and that it must result in some kind ofsocial interaction. I don’t know if you notice what I’m saying here, but that’sbonding social capital turning into bridging social capital.Before I go further, let me describe a theme camp because it’s hard to imaginein the abstract. I think my all-time-favorite theme camp, after all these years,is Camp Fink. I encountered Camp Fink by chance. I walked into a tent thatlooked like a seedy sportsman’s bar. There were crossed tennis racquets on thewall, and it had all these portraits of famous finks: Roy Cohn, Joe McCarthy,and Richard Nixon—because he finked himself out. But here’s the interactivepart. They had an ancient Corona typewriter out in front with an endless spoolof paper, and they invited you to rat out on your friends. And you’d besurprised, it got really interactive, because everyone wanted to read whateverybody else was saying!In recent years, many of these theme camps have become increasinglyambitious—and that’s only a natural tendency because in a space with no physicallimits your imagination grows larger and larger. A vision is not defined by thecontext of the world around it, but radiates reality outward: it starts todefine the surrounding world. And people get these visions and end upincorporating two or three hundred people. Now all people are collaborating toproduce a public service or an expressive theme of some kind. And they formlarge communal networks in which everyone is cooperating toward a common goal;this is what Putnam called bonding social capital.But observe what we’ve done. We’ve told people: OK, you’ve got your tight littleworld of your mates and your friends, don’t close the circle. Leave it open soyou can bridge out to a larger world, and, indeed, so you can feel the greatworld has the same sense of inner reality that you feel in yourself. And theshape of the entire city is like that. It’s planned as a huge semicircle withthe Man at the geographic center and the streets radiating out. One time someonesaid, “Larry, why don’t you just close that circle?” and I said, “Good God, we’dgo psychotic. Don’t close the circle!”So, theme camps are essentially collective gifts, and this, in turn, begins togenerate gift-giving networks. We’ve found that when people join together forthe purpose of producing a gift whose scope extends beyond the limits of theirlittle bonded world, it produces a kind of social convection current. The hotterthe flame, the more oxygen it will suck in. And these networks suck in a wholelot of resources. They begin in simple ways—and no one plans this—let me makethat clear. They just happen. For instance, someone in a camp knows someoneelse—a friend outside the group who possesses some needed resource—and soon thisperson is drawn into the circle. If he’s willing to give to the gift you don’texclude him, you say come on in. That’s the principle of radical inclusivity wediscovered many years ago.As the greater gift imagined by the group begins to grow, this process starts tospread out through networks of acquaintance, connections multiply and a new kindof superabundant wealth appears. A metal grate abandoned in a basement becomes adragon’s jaw, some ancient string of Christmas lights forgotten in the atticforms the perfect accent for its tail. Manifold resources stream in. It’sprecisely the opposite of what happens in a capitalistic society where astruggle for scarce resources produces relentless competition. And this processcan actually rival the capabilities of mass production. Social networks tend togrow on an organic principle. They expand exponentially.Here’s an example of how we are growing. A group of New Yorkers, affiliated withthe nonprofit organization SEAL, came to our event in 2001. Burning Man occursover Labor Day, so that, of course means that when this group returned fromBlack Rock City in they encountered the events of September 11th. For daysafterward a pall of dust and smoke drifted over the island of Manhattan aspolice manned emergency checkpoints all over the city. Now this group had livedcommunally at Burning Man. They had seen their bonding world become a bridgingworld and they responded to this public trauma in a unique way. They began tocraft burn barrels. These are oil barrels into which we cut designs. Theseobjects are beautiful—they look like jack-o’-lanterns—and serve as fireplacesthat protect the desert surface. So this group put the word out to create anetwork of people to manufacture burn barrels. They donated several of thesebeautiful pieces to the New York City Police Department; now, emergency workershad a place to warm their hands during the long winter nights. As I say, therate of return on social capital is a lot better than the rate of return onnormal capital investment in the market world.This is the good news. All over this country, people are starting to organize.They’re starting to form networks and we’re helping them. We don’t dictate thecontent of radical self-expression. But we help people create the socialcircumstances that will sustain an ethos of gift giving. And I can tell youwhat’s going to happen next because I have watched Burning Man grow from twothousand to four thousand to eight thousand participants in the span of threeyears. In fact, it only stopped growing at this rate because we slowed it down.We didn’t want it to grow too fast. We took measures so that we could culturallyassimilate people, so they wouldn’t just come looking for a party, so they’drealize that our ethos was about giving and not about consuming. We knew thatthey’d destroy us if we didn’t slow it down. But what this growth represents isa rate of natural increase; it’s how things grow in nature. And the next bigstory is that networks all over the country are about to rapidly expand inscope. There have now been burns in several states; we have regional contacts inevery place except Mississippi. There’s even been a burn on a boat in the BalticSea and one in Antarctica.This returns me to Richard Jefferies and his essay on the prodigality of natureand the niggardliness of man: “There is no ‘enough’ in nature. It is all onevast prodigality.” I believe that human culture—as distinct from the socialinstitutions that surround it—is a pure phenomenon of nature. Socialinstitutions have the power to protect it and sustain it, much as any vessel—apetri dish or ceramic pot—might help or hinder the growth of any living thing.But the innate vitality of culture belongs to the world of nature; it occursspontaneously, it is without a plan, and when it is allowed to grow it has apower to affect our world in ways that dwarf our normal estimate of ourresources.I think that the essential lesson that we’ve learned is, in a way, very simple.People don’t have to go out into the world and create a great city. We’ve madeour city as large and as civic as it is in order to create a sufficientlypersuasive model of the world to show people how things could be. I still wantit to grow larger, frankly. I mean it won’t be New York, but I want it to feellike a complete model of civilization so that people can go back home with theconfidence that they can change the world and they can share that vision withother people and they can attach to it some transcendent principle. That is whythe Man stands at the center of our city.This process begins with radical self-expression: the feeling that your inmostvital self is real. But most people just don’t have the confidence anymorebecause they’re too isolated; they’re too passive. So it starts with this, I’llcall it “I Am.” And it proceeds, as in a theme camp, to a feeling that you areunited with others, that you are linked in a bonded circle and together you canshare the same experience through an act of giving. And I’ll call this, “WeAre.” Finally there is the feeling that somewhere outside this circle thereexists some greater gift that everyone is joined together by as they give to it,and I’ll call this “It Is.” And I have come to believe that whenever thesefeeling states can be strung together like pearls on a string, as if they wereparts of one spontaneous gesture, you will then generate an ethos, a culture,that leads, in Jefferies’s words, to a “boundless shower of good things foreverdescending.”Now I’ve told you things are getting a bit bleak in our world. We’re just soaccustomed to this state of things that we don’t notice. But I don’t think I’vetold you just how bad they can get. So I’m going to tell you a story. It’s likeA Christmas Carol. This is where the ghost says to Scrooge, “This is Christmasfuture.” I’m going to tell you about Christmas future. This is where we’regoing.Some time ago, I went to a dinner that was given for an artist friend who wasleaving for a journey up a river into the jungle of New Guinea to confer withsome tribal sculptors. And it was a lively party. It was a bunch of my morelouche bohemian friends, and it was held in an Italian restaurant that I’d neverbeen to. I was just given an address, and when I got there I was astonished,because it was located on the edge of San Francisco’ financial district. I meanall these high-rises and condos, and it was very apparent to me that this was asmall family enterprise and that it had been there for years, and I wondered howthe hell it had survived. There were family pictures on the walls, mementos, andwe went downstairs through a narrow corridor to a special room that wasobviously precious to them. It was decorated in primary colors and we were takeninto the place of honor, and there was a big round table and on that round tablewas a giant lazy Susan. It felt really communal. It was so cool that everyonecould share. And at the center of this thing, at the center of this communalcircle, was this transcendent object. It was a bust of the Pope. In fact, they’dsurrounded it with a big square Plexiglas cube, so it looked like a miniaturePopemobile.Now this is what I call a sympathetic bistro! The food was robust, the cuisineof southern Italy, and the waiters were to a one all very jolly. I love thiskind of restaurant; I love family places. They brought in bottle after bottle ofChianti. And, of course, we were using this lazy Susan, so the bottles wentround and round, and pretty soon the room was spinning round and round as we gotdrunker and drunker. As I say, these were bohemians and never noted for anyinhibition, and they became increasingly rambunctious, and at a certain pointone of the guests by the name of Kaos Kitty climbed up on the table andproceeded to do things to the head of the Pope that I really don’t want todescribe to you—let’s call it radical self-expression.This is, of course, the kind of scandalous story that’s often better in thetelling, something you read about in a memoir of the lives of the artists. Therewas a lot of laughter, shocked looks from people in the adjoining room, and myfriends, on the whole, were thrilled by their audacity. But I will confess toyou tonight that I was inwardly chagrined. Think about it for a moment. Here wewere in the bosom of this family place around the altar of their simply Catholicpiety … desecrating it? And I left the restaurant that night feeling a pang ofguilt and a flush of shame on my face, I really did. I thought about apologizingas I went out, but I was too ashamed, and for weeks afterward I was burdened bythis feeling of guilt because I’d sat by … I’d laughed too.Well, some months later my girlfriend and I were walking through the slushystreets of Minneapolis in the middle of a midwinter thaw. There was fog fillingthe air and we were looking for some place to eat at a late hour. We went arounda corner and across the street I saw this nimbus of neon light in the air. Wecrossed over and, sure enough, it was a neon sign and, sure enough, it was asympathetic bistro—on fact it was the sympathetic bistro. It was the same placeI’d encountered in San Francisco! And I thought, well gee, did a cousin, anephew branch out to Minneapolis?We went inside and the atmosphere brimmed with familiar sentiment. Familypictures lined the walls, and they’d painted the exposed plumbing … and then itreally dawned on me. This was not a sympathetic bistro. What I’m saying is thiswas not a communal thing, this was not a bonded group. This was not a familyrestaurant. The pictures and the keepsakes on the walls had been purchased bythe lot at auction. And when I looked at the other diners, all of them white,pretty Anglo-Saxon looking and undoubtedly Lutheran, the full implications ofthis began to sink in. Most of the tables were for large groups. This was thedemographic. A waiter came in with a lighted cake, there was a birthday party,and suddenly I understood what this was. It was a RED, an acronym for retailentertainment destination. This is the fastest-growing trend in retail, and it’sremaking our world. REDs are the finest flower of our marketing system and theyare a commodification of our lives. You see most of our desire and addictionsare really projections of our need to be. And they’ve become really good atfinding out what our desires are, and they’ve learned to create stuff—both goodsand entertainment—which we then consume as substitutes for being.In the case of the jolly bistro, some entrepreneur had determined—usingdemographic studies and psychographic profiles—what WASPs really need in theirlives. And I can tell you from personal experience what WASPs really do need intheir lives. Family members often live in different states, and family dinnersand gatherings can be awkward. You don’t have anything in common with anyonebecause bonding social capital has broken down a little. So you go to thesegatherings, and you find yourself wistfully and secretly wishing that thingswere, oh, a little warmer, a little more sympathetic, a little more … well,Mediterranean. If only we could be Italians! And this environment, this bistro,was designed to fill this gap. Art blended with science. If people want to feelthat they belong to one another, then it’s wholly feasible and very profitableto manufacture the illusion of this feeling. I had really enjoyed the food atthe original restaurant back home, but sitting there with my girlfriend I pickedindifferently at my meatball. I kind of herded it around the plate and, as I didso, I forgave Kaos Kitty for her performance. In fact, on the whole, it seemedvery appropriate.Let me give you a little profile of retail entertainment destinations. They’reusually located in metropolitan areas, and they’re devoted to the propositionlong understood by marketers that it’s more lucrative to sell a state of beingthan a product. There’s nothing new in this. Sell the sizzle, not the steak.That’s what they used to say, but REDs in this late stage of capitalism arebased on much shrewder and more sophisticated insights. They’re not just sellingattractive and desirable sensations; they’re selling a lot more than that.REDs come in different shapes and sizes. I’ve described the little restaurant,but it works up into larger complexes. These typically combine dining, shopping,and entertainment attractions. In the trade journals this is called the “trinityof synergy.” Because they know if you’re eating and you’re shopping and you’rebeing entertained, you’ll spend a lot more money. It grows up into verylarge-scale complexes, and these are being built at a tremendous rate. You knowwhat I’m talking about: Disneyland, the Strip in Las Vegas, New York’s TimesSquare.Another feature of these places is an air of amenity and authenticity:monumental architecture, open-air loggias, colonnades, fountains, vaultedceilings, and decorative plasterwork. It’s all part of what’s come to be calledthe “experience economy.” These places are designed to appeal to our need forcommunity and identity. At times they almost seem to waft a sense, albeit rathercheapened, of classical civilization. At least it seems so superficially, butwhen you descend to ground level, to the place where humans interact, the placewhere culture’s roots should grow, it is a very different story.After my experience with the jolly bistro, I became fascinated with theseplaces. So two years ago at Christmas time I decided to go to Las Vegas. Iwanted to see the great mother of them all and learn something from it. Now I’lladmit to you that I dislike the yuletide season. This great orgy of spending andconsumption and forced giving seems to me like the ultimate perversion of whatgiving should be. So I engage in whatever activity feels like the opposite ofChristmas. So it was that in late December of 2000 my girlfriend and I embarkedon a holiday and we decided to call it our Viva Las Xmas tour.At the same time, the Guggenheim announced its plan to open a gallery as amagnet attraction at the Venetian. That’s an example of what the trade journalscall edutainment. And later, on TV, a young woman representing the museumdescribed this venture as a noble form of democratic outreach to the hoi polloi,to the unwashed masses—and, I might add, a very lucrative proposition for itsgift shop. And an art critic was featured looking like he’d just downed asnifter of quinine water. He was actually wearing a turtleneck, and he talkedabout the postmodern implications of this daring move and how it wasironic … and so forth.You see, in the last twenty years Vegas has reinvented itself as a thoroughgoingRED. It used to be this sleazy place where guys went for action, but ah, notanymore! It’s now a center of edutainment, infotainment, eatotainment—every kindof ’tainment you can think of. They’ve torn down all the old facades and, intheir place, they’ve erected palaces that offer up the holy trinity of marketsynergy. We wandered through these great complexes. We loitered in the shadow ofanimatronic sculptures. We witnessed the musical fountains and beheld thepharaonic mysteries of ancient Egypt at the Luxor. At Caesar’s Palace I actuallybought an ashtray, I admit it. It was irresistible. But my favorite place wasthe Rio, because there we discovered a riverboat that they’d mounted on theceiling on a curvilinear track, and it was filled with performers who, likeperformers on Broadway, were dancing and singing their hearts out. It actuallywas interactive, and I got kind of excited about that. They kept coming aroundand they were waving at us and we were waving at them.In fact, this kind of interactivity is typical of REDs. Here is my favoritequote from a trade. It explains that interactivity is a key component ofimmersion environments: “Free street performances, another form of ambiententertainment, strive to replicate the spontaneity of the archetypal, if notmythical, marketplace. Yet because they work independently, their performancecan be unpredictable making them potentially disruptive to both visitors andtenants. Thus authentic performances are not commonly allowed on the privateproperty of destination complexes.” Instead they hire performers and typicallythese performances are of short duration. They’ve studied this and found thatmaximum spending is reckoned to take place during a period of three to fourhours. This is the reason for the ersatz interactions, why they hire theseperformers, and why the performances are so brief.We did witness the great speaking statue of Neptune at Caesar’s Palace. It wasset in a courtyard, and, in a weird kind of cartoon way it might have beenFlorence. It could have been a northern Italian hill town with its a publicsquare, a very civic setting. This robotic Neptune spoke to us for about sevenminutes, it attracted a large crowd, and then it stopped and everyonedispersed—and where did they go? Right into all these shops that strategicallysurrounded it. And every one was a brand name high-end retail outlet sellinggoods at a 200 percent markup! And I’ll make an even more embarrassingconfession: I went into one and bought a pair of Gucci’s. Even knowing what itwas, I was caught up in the trance.You see, these settings are engineered with the precision of a hermeticallysealed engine. Though they may look like urban spaces, you’ll find no posterspasted to the lampposts, and you will experience none of the spontaneousencounters that are the lifeblood of culture.What you will discover is what we discovered: the people chute. In the processof reinventing itself, Vegas has built an elaborate system of pedestriantransportation. They’ve located large parking complexes on the periphery of theStrip, and they funnel people through casino environments by an integratedsystem of escalators, bridges, elevators, tramways, and a variety of othermechanical devices. We were never more than ten feet away from an opportunity tobuy something. It was virtually impossible to escape this. The space of onecasino bled seamlessly into the next.At the very end of our stay we took the elevator upstairs at the Rio, walkedinto a restaurant and went out on the terrace, and there, spread out before us,was the Strip: this great evil drive train glittering in the desert night. And Ithought to myself, this is just like Burning Man! We, too, create a scene, afantasy environment. Each year we create an annual art theme because we believethat stories and myths are one way that people belong to each other and one waythat you can get artists to collaborate. What is more, we fill it withinteraction and ambient entertainment. The theme camps and art are magnetattractions. We even have our own Electric Parade every year! Spread out on thedesert floor, our glittering city is a capsule world that obliges people tolinger and loiter and totally immerse themselves in an environment. The onlydifference is that you cannot buy or sell anything. The only difference is thatyou are seldom more than ten feet away from opportunities to interact with artand other human beings. The only difference is that you must give of yourself.The only difference, finally, is that it is real.You see, the great irony of this is that the creators of these REDs have almostinadvertently reinvented a model of classical civilization. Pursuing a path ofmarket research, they’ve learned that human beings crave something greater thanthemselves to which they can belong. They’ve learned that we need myths andstories that can tell us who we are. They’ve learned that we need a coherenttheater in which to act out life’s drama.And yet, marketers also know that in our modern world the public craves varietyand choice. The Palladian facades of the Venetian palaces that they concoctallude to an older order in which traditions shaped and governed everything. Butunderneath it all, beneath the plaster facades and the faux marbling, they knowthat in today’s consuming world the individual and individual’s desires areking. It is, in fact, our desires as individuals disassociated from history,place, and any sense of a surrounding community that drive our economic system.Judged by any civilized standard, the mass culture of an RED is an oxymoron. YetI think there is much we can learn from it.And this goes back to where I began. I said the great value of our modern systemis that it uniquely caters to the individual. We are in the forefront of thisconsumer revolution, but all around the globe traditional societies that oncehoused cultural processes and formed social vessels of belonging are beginningto shatter. We used to call these societies the third world, but now they’recalled emerging economies—but we are now, today in America, the mostindividualized and the most self-conscious people that have ever existed on theface of the earth. And I don’t think we are ready to return to a simpler life orthe type of society that once sustained culture.Demands for self-restraint will not be heard because we demand choice, we demandfreedom, and we value our individuality more that anything else. Nor do I thinkwe can reconstruct the kinds of societies that once helped culture to thrive.They depended on the fact that people had to struggle together, thatcircumstances held people together over long periods of time. We want to changeour jobs, we want to move freely through the world, we want to redefineourselves continually: we have exploded that ancient world of tradition.I’ve discussed a continuum of being: an I am, a We are, and an It is. But if youlook at all previous ages of human culture, the order of this continuum startedwith It is, with gods and myths of supernatural origin, sustained by traditionsamong people who struggled to survive in a challenging world. And it endedsomewhat tenuously with the experience of the individual. Today this sequenceworks and must work in reverse. It must necessarily begin with I am, at thelevel of each individual’s experience.So let me return to my comparison of Burning Man with retail entertainmentdestinations. The essential appeal of Burning Man is to the individual. We’veachieved an ethos, and we have a few basic rules. But no one is required tosubordinate himself or herself. Instead, all are invited to expand themselves.Burning Man is available on their terms: anyone can engage in radicalself-expression. Everyone is free to do and be. The great difference between usand the consumer marketplace, however, is that we have inverted the essentialnature of the capitalist system. We are like Disneyland turned inside out.Because at the heart and center of this thing you will find a gift and, in sodoing, you yourself, your unique spirit will itself become a gift and beconsumed like fire in its passage to the sky.Seventeen years ago, I started Burning Man on a beach in San Francisco. This isfrequently the first thing that people ask me about. They want a myth, and I wasonce incautious enough to tell a reporter that it corresponded to theanniversary of a lost love affair. That story has now circled the globe, andit’s been interpreted and reinterpreted as myths often are. I’ve been told thatI was burning myself, that I was burning my ex-girlfriend, that I was burning myex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend, but none of these stories are true. They’refactoids. They’re myths in the modern sense of the word: distortions of thetruth. And yet people keep asking me this question, and I think it’s becausethey’re looking for a myth in the older and more profound sense of the term. Butmyths are not about chains of causation or rational reasoning. They tell us thatthe essence of things is contained in first causes, and that everything, as inany vision, emanates radically out of this. That’s what people are asking me totell them. That’s the nature of the story that they need to hear. So I will tellyou that story.One day in 1986 I called a friend and said, let’s build a man and burn him onthe beach. I did this on impulse. There was really nothing on my mind. I’vethought about it over the years, and the best I can say is that some passionateprompting, some immediate vision just had to be embodied in the world. Call itradical self-expression … I Am. We built our man from scraps of wood, thencalled some friends and took it to the beach. We saturated it with gasoline andput a match to it, and within minutes our numbers doubled. That’s actually whenBurning Man began as an institution, you know. We were so moved by that we knewwe had to do it again. If we’d done it as a private and personal thing, I’m surewe wouldn’t have repeated it. And I remember holding my son in my arms, and Ilooked at each face illuminated in the firelight. They had formed a semicircleabout it, and I was so moved—We Are. They’d all come to see this gift. A womanran over and held its hand. I didn’t know who she was. The wind was shunting theflames to one side, and someone took a picture of it—it’s the only recordedinstant. She just had to touch it. She wanted to belong to it. And then, ofcourse, there was the Man himself. Standing there against the limitless horizonof the broad Pacific, it seemed to belong to the ocean, to belong to the sky—toexist in some realm immeasurably beyond us. It formed a fireball, a second sunbrought down to earth, a sudden, uncontrollable and completely spontaneousemission of energy. It Is. And when I look at Black Rock City today, I noticethat its curving streets are like that semicircle of people so many years ago onBaker Beach. Our city seems to reach out to the Man as if it could capture him,but can never quite possess this gift at its center. I Am … We Are … It Is. Whatmore is there to say, except that I believe there is a way that all of us can betogether."},{"pageContent":"17A FAREWELL TO ADVERTISINGKEN JORDANI get great pleasure from imagining a world with no advertising. Sure, there’sthe occasional commercial that gets me to smile, but most ads make me feel likeI’m being talked down to; instead of addressing me in an honest, straightforwardway, they try to draw my attention to whatever they’re hawking through gimmickymanipulations—for instance, paying a celebrity to announce how dearly he adoresa certain car insurance, gas-guzzling SUV, or cat litter. Other ads try to freakme out because my breath smells, my armpits reek, and my hair isn’t glossyenough to earn me a kiss. No need to list the other approaches ad agenciesemploy; we’ve all internalized the myriad strategies used to subliminally coerceus into buying stuff we don’t need or want.The sense I get from advertising is that I’m continually being lied to,everywhere I turn. But more disturbing still is that the picture of the worldoffered by advertising is of a throw-away consumer culture based on instantgratification, presented as a kind of heavenly paradise. We are in the midst ofthe Sixth Great Extinction, our country is perpetually at war, Wall Street’sinvestment culture has revealed itself to be irredeemably morally bankrupt, andthrough it all, we are bathed by a perpetual stream of consumerist messagingthat proclaims we live in a material paradise. All you have to do is buy theright beer, and babelicious models climb out of your fridge. Shopping sets youfree.But despite the relentless propaganda, at this point most Americans accept thatour version of consumer culture is unsustainable. Not everyone sees this,certainly, but for decades the number has been growing, and some demographersthink this long-time minority perspective became the majority in 2008, the yearof the Obama election, which is a convenient marker for the shift. And yet, weare assaulted by more ads than ever. They appear on eggs and apples at thestore, arrive as cell phone spam, sneak up as product placement in themovies—some sources say that the average American is exposed to as many as threethousand ad messages a day. They blare at us from every conceivable angle: thesides of buildings, the floors of subway platforms, the back doors of publicbathroom stalls. They shake, flash, and squeal in mock delight, aching toconvince us that our deepest needs can be satisfied on the supermarket shelf.We’re only one kitchen cleanser away from having the time of our lives.The cumulative effect of this non-stop assault, which begins at birth andcontinues through our final moments, is to make us numb. We know we can’t trustads, but we get suckered in by them; ultimately, they achieve what they aredesigned to do, which is to sell product. Our understandable response is todevelop a thick wall of defense against their come-ons. We become sophisticatedcritics, armed with irony and a knee-jerk cynicism, knowing better than toaccept an ad at face value. At the same time, we can’t imagine an alternative tothe consumerism they promote, and so fall prey to their manipulations again andagain. As good cynics, we realize that any effort to remake society is bound tofail, so we might as well stock up on the latest disposable pleasure and makesure to get our money’s worth. But seeds have been planted for an alternativeworth considering.Today, thanks to the internet, once I know what I want, I can usually find itpretty quickly. For instance, it took me about ninety seconds to discover thatAmericans are exposed to three thousand ads a day, and I was then able tocompare that number to estimates from other sources. Search engines have becomeextremely effective at connecting people to what they’re looking for.Recommendation engines, like the kind on Amazon.com [http://www.Amazon.com] thatsuggests books you might be interested in, based on your previous purchases,have steadily improved, linking you to music and books you probably will like,people you could date, schools to attend, cars to buy. These matchmakingtechnologies might not be able to look into your soul and surprise you with anoffer out of left field, but once you express, for example, an interest inpermaculture, automated systems are now quite good at letting you know about newpermaculture books and DVDs, and (in theory) permaculture courses, groups,gardening supplies—whatever a budding per-maculturist could want.Matchmaking systems of this kind are popping up everywhere online.Unfortunately, they are guided by the same manipulative practices andquestionable ethics endemic to the advertising industry. Companies engaged indigital advertising, like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, do their best tosurreptitiously track the online behavior of whoever they can, creating detailedprofiles of each of us that will help them capture our interests and predict ourfuture purchases. Beacon and cookie technology installed by third parties stalksus as we go from website to website, following where we go and watching what weclick on. So if I spend a lot of time on car websites, I might notice that whilevisiting CNN.com [http://www.CNN.com], MSNBC.com [http://www.MSNBC.com], orYouTube, suddenly a legion of car ads appear. Marketers will spend extra forthese targeted ads, because it helps them narrow in on likely customers, makingthe ad-buying process less like firing buckshot. And if you do want to buy a newcar, all the car ads suddenly flooding your screen might be useful.But these matchmaking systems, as they currently exist, have serious drawbacks.For a start, you have no idea what these profiles say about you, or what isbeing done with them. The data collected about you, usually without yourknowledge, is owned by the company that collects it, which can do whatever itpleases with that information, including sell it to whoever pays. The lawyers atthe Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF), the Electronic Privacy InformationCenter (EPIC), and other privacy advocates are rightly outraged by how littlecontrol we have over the data about us that streams across the internet. Theyare also frustrated by how little the public seems to care about it. People tendto prioritize convenience over privacy, and they don’t expect that the owners ofthese profiles will abuse them, or at least not so badly that a real crisisresults.At the same time, it is also true that mainstream media has barely touched thisstory, aside from the occasional article in the Wall Street Journal or New YorkTimes, so who knows how widely understood the situation actually is. Certainly,it is in the interest of media companies to keep concern low, since targeted adsbring them higher rates at a time when their traditional business model ismelting down. But it is sadly predictable that abuses will occur withoutappropriate oversight, just as they did recently in the housing market and onWall Street, to disastrous effect.You can expect that soon profiles about you will be compiled with anexpansiveness and efficiency that would have made the East German secret servicegreen with envy. How will that information be used? Will that profile bereviewed by an employer to discover if you take part in “questionable” behavior,or will a landlord check into your “desirability” before you sign a new lease?If they can, while reducing financial risk and reassuring investors, it’s hardto believe they would resist.Meanwhile, the ads that get pumped out through this targeting system areunchanged, as annoying and manipulative as ever. And as the number of admessages we receive grows, the attention that any one attracts drops. MadisonAvenue has been complaining for years about how hard it is to cut through theclutter in this crowded environment, that it forces them to push out more andmore ads if they hope to have an impact and get precious clicks. But why shouldyou click? Ads swarm around us like gnats, asking to be swatted away. Your firstimpulse is to not click, because you know ads can’t be trusted. The averageclick-through rate for an online ad is a fraction of 1 percent; a response bymore than 2 percent is considered a phenomenal success. Think about it: over 98percent of viewers prefer to not respond to the interactive ads they see.But instead of bending matchmaking technology to the purposes of the oldmarketing paradigm, emerging technologies could support a different model, onethat respects our privacy, acknowledges our intelligence, and responds to actualneeds, not manufactured desires. Imagine how different things would be ifmarketing messages had integrity, if their claims were vetted by trustedsources, and if they informed you about things you really want, so you couldevaluate whether a product is right for you. Instead of being on the receivingend of an endless stream of crafty seductions that hope to trigger a purchase,you would be exposed to just a few that are clear and informative, and only forproducts that you deliberately express an interest in. An ad’s claims would bevalidated by independent third parties, like Consumer Reports, and these ratingswould be easy to find, even if they are less than favorable.You’re probably thinking: forget it, that’s impossible. And, of course, you’reprobably right. But before you dismiss this prospect entirely, please join mefor a thought experiment. Suppose that: * Instead of an anonymous corporation owning your personal data, and deciding what to do with it without your permission, you control the data in your digital profile. You choose to “track yourself” as you go from place to place online, collecting the geologs from your mobile phone, your social network links, your current address and other relevant data in your profile. With this control, you get to decide what information is in your digital profile, what information can be shared with whom and under what conditions. This is not a pipe dream; companies are appearing that can provide these services. For instance, as this book goes to press, a new class of services is emerging that offers data banking to consumers; just as your money is not made invalid when you move it from one bank to another, your data can be portable in the same way between service providers. Companies such as Mydex, Azigo, Personal.com [http://www.Personal.com] and Singly are offering the first wave of digital data banking services of this kind, and are an encouraging sign of things to come. * Instead of being on the receiving end of a relentless stream of unwelcome ads, you use your digital profile to express interests and needs, soliciting information about the product categories that matter to you. Rather than being solicited by marketing companies who push out ads based on their best guesses about what you might respond to, you only view the marketing messages you request. It is well known that pursuing “qualified leads” of this kind is a far more effective way to reach a customer than today’s buckshot model. * Instead of producing ads that compete for your attention by making cheesy come-ons or questionable claims—while communicating next to nothing that can be trusted—advertisers agree to follow a code of conduct. Promotional claims are validated by independent third parties. Today, there are scores of certification systems that evaluate claims about product safety, greenness, organic materials, localism, and fair labor practices. Twenty-first-century Green Seal stamps would be printed on every package and be a click away from any ad banner. Product information becomes easily available and transparent—not because the government compels it, but because the absence of third-party certification signals consumers not to buy a product. * Instead of staring blankly at a new product, unable to learn whether friends and others you trust have tried and liked it, you have access to a list of people you know that says whether they give the product a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down.” Every product, of course, has mixed reviews. But you can easily find the percentage of people whose shopping prowess you trust that have endorsed a particular product—not because they get paid for it, but because they want you to support the best green cleanser, the best locally built furniture, the most effective water-saving washing machine. Again, this information is managed through your user-centric digital profile. * Instead of pushing sales messages onto an unsuspecting public, marketing companies act as brokers that work on behalf of both the producer and the consumer, bringing the two into contact. If you are in the market for a new rug, for instance, your interest is broadcast to floor cover marketing companies, which respond with information about their clients. Based on your desired price point, material of choice, and design type, the marketers target the messages they send to you. Because they have agreed to follow a code of conduct, the ads are substantive instead of gimmicky. Clicking on the banner brings you to a web page that conveys what you need to know about the product, along with a video and a list of stores near you that stock it. The best marketers are known for the effectiveness of their matchmaking capabilities in a trusted environment.This approach would fundamentally alter the way we shop. The difference was madeclear to me by Kaliya Hamlin, organizer of the semi-annual Internet IdentityWorkshop conferences in the Bay Area, and one of the leading analysts of digitalidentity trends. The current model, she explained, can be shown in a simplediagram with three nodes (see figure 1): the buyer, the producer, and themarketer—which is the sole intermediary between the other two, sending messagesto potential buyers with little to no idea who the buyers are, hoping to converta sale. Note that the communication from the marketer to the buyer is in onedirection, with the buyer at the receiving end, unable to respond or participatein any kind of dialogue. In many instances, the marketer is supported byservices that provide digital dossiers on millions of people that help them totarget customers. For instance, Experian proudly boasts that it has detailedprofiles of 2.1 billion people which it offers for sale to support targeted webadvertising.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_007_r1.jpg]Figure 1.The alternative model, made possible by digital identity technology, introducestwo new intermediaries between the buyer and the producer (see figure 2). One isthe buyer’s agent, which represents the interest of the buyer and broadcasts themessage that the buyer is looking for a particular product—such as a dark blueorganic wool rug that is six by nine feet. This agent is the trusted broker ofthe buyer’s personal data (its “data banker”), and it only shares thisinformation under the buyer’s direction. The second new intermediary is theproducer’s agent, which broadcasts information about the producer’s products tobuyers’ agents across the internet, looking for matches. This productinformation would be detailed and vetted by third parties, and should includethe product’s environmental impact, labor conditions, consumer evaluations, andmore. So before the buyer makes a decision about whether or not to purchase thatrug, she knows how it was manufactured, the materials that went into it, andwhat other people think about it. The key to this model is that the buyer’sagent is aware of the buyer’s personal data, and the producer’s agent is not. Afully functioning market like this eliminates the need for services that selldigital dossiers to marketers, such as Experian. The transactions could takeplace online, but just as likely, the producer’s agent could draw potentialbuyers to come by brick-and-mortar retail outlets to experience the products inperson.[images/Pinc_9781583943502_epub_008_r1.jpg]Figure 2.You can see how a system like this could grow to include all of the essentialproducts you use, from toilet paper and face cream to clothing and hardware. Thetechnology exists today to turn our marketing paradigm upside down—or, perhapsmore accurately, right side up. The key innovation is for digital profile datato move easily from place to place online, under the control and ownership ofthe person it is about. Over the past few years, a number of components of thispotential new systems have emerged from forums like the Internet IdentityWorkshop, OASIS, W3C and the World Economic Forum Rethinking Personal Dataproject. The core of these systems are built by privacy activists to keepgovernments and corporations from holding information about you withoutpermission. The challenge to this twenty-first-century marketing paradigm is nottechnical. Rather, it is social. As a society, are we ready to apply existingtechnology to transform how we exchange goods?Once products are connected to people’s actual needs, the entire thrust ofmessages that marketers send would change. No more need for misleading claims.The tenor of advertising would shift to propositions coming from a place ofintegrity. At the same time, the rationale for wasteful, flashy packaging iseliminated. (You bought a computer to send email, not to revel in the layers ofperfectly sculpted plastic shards that you had to tear out of the box to get atit.) One possible by-product of such a system could be that, without society’srelentless call to consume, people might realize that they would be happier withless than they currently possess. Why burden yourself with your own vacuumcleaner, lawn mower, coffee grinder, crock pot, electric heating pad, washingmachine, or any of the other myriad contraptions that clutter up the averagemiddle-class American apartment? All it takes is a moment of reflection torealize that each is used for an hour or two a week, if that. Why not poolresources with your neighbors, put the best appliances in a hall closet, givethe extras away, and replace the broken ones (they always break) with reallygood ones meant to last, which are worth repairing and which you would bestretched to buy on your own? At the same time, you get to know your neighbors.Less is more.We know that America’s relationship to stuff has to change, and digital toolsgive us the opportunity to design the kind of marketplace we want to live with.In the process of constructing it, we transform our communities and ourselves.We heal our hearts, pursuing the path of a more transparent, less materialistsociety. The earth is calling us to embrace a new politics of the sacred, onewhich will expand the safe space where the heart can be revealed, available forconnection. As hard as it might be to believe such a transformation is possible,in fact, a profound change might be closer than anyone might think, ready to beexpressed in how we live our daily lives. Along the fringes, far from theshopping mall, a yearning can be felt for a different kind of commerce.Thanks to Kaliya Hamlin for reading a draft of this article and offeringextremely helpful comments and suggested revisions."},{"pageContent":"18THE BNOTE: LOCAL CURRENCY FOR BALTIMOREJEFF DICKEN AND MICHAEL TEWEven before printing a single note, everywhere we go in Baltimore people havealready heard of the BNote, and businesses are signing on to accept them when welaunch in spring 2011. We are finding that people support the idea of pioneeringan alternative economic system, one that benefits people instead ofcorporations. Google searches now show websites referencing Baltimore’s newlocal currency, and the local press radio is starting to cover us. Our currencydesign contest went global when blogs picked up the announcement. When the BNotearrives in Baltimore, only the birds will be surprised. In less than a year, wehave grown from a bright idea into an organization on track to establish a localcurrency with broad community participation.Much of this progress is due to the diversity and positive vision that theEvolver Social Movement has fostered among its local groups. Each local Evolvergroup puts on a monthly event, called a Spore, about topics relevant to thetransformation. A Baltimore Spore on local currencies took place in the summerof 2009. Damien Nichols, who attended, asked his friend Michael Tew to join himat the next Spore to meet the people who seemed to share his activist vision.Michael’s background is in both microfinance and legislative lobbying, and hehad been looking for an opportunity to advance alternative economic systems on acommunity level. At the Spore, Michael participated in the discussion thatfollowed the panel, and was invited to make a short presentation at thefollowing Spore on the subject of microfinance. There, he put forth thepossibility that, by the end of 2012, a microfinance-based economy could becomethe dominant form of economic organization for most people on the planet.Moreover, he proposed that Baltimore could be a good place to bring togethermicrofinance with a local currency.After his presentation, Michael met Jeff Dicken, a long-time supporter ofmicrofinance efforts who has a background in information technology and thearts. During this and subsequent conversations, the importance of a localcurrency to a resilient community in face of economic meltdown becameincreasingly clear. Soon after, Jill Harrison, a social activist with experiencein nonprofits, joined the team, and when Michael moved to Baltimore in March2010, they began to have regular meetings. As word spread among Evolvers aboutthe effort, more people expressed a willingness to help. By the end of June aneffective and growing team of enthusiastic volunteers was gathering.The next step was to address some basic questions: Should the currency systemuse a debit system or paper money? What organizational form should the governingbody adopt? If we went with paper, how should we design and print the currency?How to attract community participation? We distributed the notes from eachmeeting to the group, including web links to resources, so everyone stayedinformed and involved; we also discussed many of the system’s featuresinformally by email between meetings so that face-to-face conversations could bemore productive. We decided to issue only one- and five-dollar value notes inthe first year, and to call the currency the BNote.The UK–based Lewes Pound website’s guide to starting a currency and PeterNorth’s Local Money provided invaluable guidance as we put together thestrongest features of other currencies already in existence.Our currency would be convertible to and from U.S. dollars, and we chose torestrict the pilot launch to a specific, easily identifiable neighborhood. TheHampden community turned out to have many of the features important to theadoption of a local currency: * Small-business support. The Hampden Merchant’s Association lists 162 independent businesses as members. There are few chain stores, and Hampden residents tend to do most shopping locally. * Defined geographic area. Hampden is in the heart of Baltimore, bounded by the Jones Falls waterway on the west and Hopkins University to the east, with clear boundaries to the north and south as well. * Community. Historically, the area was populated by immigrant mill workers. While recent years have seen much gentrification, a strong sense of community identity still exists, and there are many longstanding community organizations. At the same time, a wave of young, progressive Baltimoreans have moved into the neighborhood, opening businesses and providing new energy.To encourage residents to think about the nature of money, and to inspire acontinuing dialogue that will help shape the details of the system we establish,we have had a series of community meetings. These start with videos aboutcurrency or economic subjects, followed by a discussion about the BNote. Weencourage people to get our monthly email newsletter, the BNote Buzz, and borrowmaterials from our small circulating library of books, articles, and DVDs. Inaddition, we’ve made some videos and animations that present our vision tostimulate interest in the project.To encourage community participation, we launched a currency design contest atthe annual HampdenFest in September 2010, where volunteers staffed a booth andconnected with people from the neighborhood.U.S. dollars will be convertible into BNotes at a 10 percent discount; tendollars will buy eleven BNotes, each of which circulates at a value equivalentto one dollar. In this way, people get an immediate benefit from adopting thecurrency, and merchants who are able to spend their BNotes with other businessesor residents in the system do not see any negative financial impact.Merchants can use the BNotes they accept in a number of ways. They can use themto buy stock or services for their business from others in the network. They canpay themselves and/or their employees partially in BNotes. They can give them aschange, to encourage circulation. They can use them for their own purchases. Andif for some reason they choose to exchange some back for dollars, BNotes may beredeemed at the same rate: eleven BNotes for ten dollars. There is a clearfinancial benefit to using the notes, and this speeds up the circulation.The more extensive the network of storefront businesses, independent serviceproviders, artisans, and residents who accept BNotes, the longer the notes willcirculate (of course, the ideal is them to circulate indefinitely), and thestronger the system will be.With no spread between the purchase and redemption rates to benefit thegoverning body, we will rely on other sources of income to fund the system’sadministration. While we expect to rely on contributions and grants to coverinitial expenses, we should also be able to help support our organizationthrough local currency “leakage,” which occurs when a currency is bought andthen withdrawn from circulation by collectors and souvenir hunters. This willinclude sales of mint and withdrawn notes to collectors through an organizedmarketing campaign. Another source of revenue will come from sales of artworkbased on the BNote, such as postcards, T-shirts, and posters, and fromcommissions on sales of original local artwork through our website. In addition,the money on deposit to back the notes in circulation, amounting to 90 percentof the face value of the circulating BNotes, will generate a small amount ofinterest and will act as a microloan fund secured against cash flow, enabling usto make hybrid microloans.A key part of our plan includes a microfinance program. We will use the capitalgained from currency conversion to offer loans to local microbusinesses. In ourview, this can be accomplished best if the microentrepreneurs are among thepoorest, most disadvantaged members of the community. Traditional charitiesrarely reach this sector because it is difficult and time consuming, and so isnot a high priority for them, while banks tend to avoid poor people like theplague.A secondary, but important feature of this process is the filling in of supplyand service chains, which enable merchants to use the currency rather than cashit in. This, in turn, will build a stronger currency, enabling the bills to stayin circulation, and also reduce the need for goods to be brought in from longerdistances, reducing the area’s carbon footprint—another contribution tosustainability.We have accomplished a lot in just a few months, but much remains to be done. Weare in the process of writing a formal mission statement and incorporating. Wewill also set up an advisory board of Hampden community leaders, as well asexperts in currency, microfinance, and social business. And we will continue toenlist businesses to participate in the mid-2011 rollout.Our discussions with other east coast currency programs have been very helpful,and we continue to reach out to volunteers, both inside and outside of theEvolver Social Movement, who share our vision. As our effort grows inexperience, moving forward step by step, we are excited to contribute to agrowing national movement that is spreading community currencies across thecountry, enabling localization projects and helping our economies to become moresocially conscious and sustainable."},{"pageContent":"19IS GOD EXPENSIVE?ELIEZER SOBELIn my early thirties, my favorite uncle, Norbert, recognized that I was on aspiritual path, and in a moment of candor, confessed that when he was aroundnineteen he used to hang out at the Ramakrishna Foundation, and later becamedeeply interested in the works of author Paul Brunton, whom he had had theprivilege of meeting. Brunton was a well-known disciple of Ramana Maharshi’s,and my uncle had a full collection of Brunton’s books. Even after Alzheimer’shad begun its assault on Norbert’s cognitive skills, he was often pullingBrunton books off the shelf to read aloud quotations about the mystery of theinner self. His affinity for these matters was for a long time unknown toeveryone in the family apart from his wife, my Aunt Karin, and was a realrevelation to me, for even as a child, on some level I had recognized Norbert asa kindred spirit. Or more accurately, I could feel somehow that he hadrecognized me as a kindred spirit!The only spiritual advice Norbert ever offered me over the years was surroundingthe issue of money. A purist from the old school, he insisted that if anyoneever charged any money at all in exchange for spiritual teachings, I should runthe other away as fast as possible. Thankfully my two earliest teachers, RamDass and Hilda Charlton, never charged. But as for the rest of my career as aseeker … let’s just say I’ve paid through the nose. Uncle Norbert was notfamiliar with the sheer magnitude of commerce connected with contemporaryspiritual pursuits, and I was reluctant to fill him in on all the teachers I hadpaid over the years, for surely he would have cast a leery and suspicious eye onall of them and doubted their motivations as well as my acumen.Nor had Norbert heard one of the popular, prevailing ideas of those times: moneyis simply “green energy,” and like all energy, can be used for good or ill. Andwho better to use lots of money for good than one’s revered spiritual teacher?The problem, of course, was that somehow that approach to spirituality and moneymatters also often involved Swiss bank accounts, offshore trusts, andridiculously lavish lifestyles, perhaps symbolized most blatantly by formertelevangelist Jim Bakker’s famous gold-plated toilet seat. Or by Osho’s (BhagwanShree Rajneesh’s) ninety-nine Rolls Royces. (In Osho’s defense, one of myheroes, Tom Robbins, insists that the cars were performance art, and thatBhagwan was merely offering a mirror to and making a mockery of our extremelymaterialistic culture. One does have to wonder, though, why he stopped atninety-nine.)One evening in the late ’70s I attended an evening talk with Leonard Orr, thefounder of Rebirthing. The price of admission was fifty dollars, but in returnLeonard was promising to give people an idea that was worth many times thatamount, an idea that could easily produce great riches. I revealed the idea inmy book, The 99th Monkey, which costs $16.95, representing a savings of over 60percent. And now in this anthology, I’m giving it away for a fraction of thatcost!Here is Leonard’s idea. “My personal connection to Infinite Intelligence issufficient to yield me a huge, personal fortune.” The funny thing is, I don’tdoubt the truth of that at all. Of course, if you speak to Job about it, hemight further clarify that “Your personal connection to Infinite Intelligence isalso sufficient to bring you to the absolute brink of ruin.” InfiniteIntelligence is very moody; it can go either way. But in the meantime, perhaps areader can sell Leonard’s affirmation on eBay: “Invaluable Idea, Like New,Barely Used.”My friend Randy simply can’t believe the kinds of things people will pay for,and keeps insisting that the two of us could easily create a religion with himas the charismatic leader and make a ton of money. He has already begun workingon his fundamental teaching concerning the distinction between what he iscalling “The Vertical Path” and “The Path Upward,” and which one will cost more.I actually recognized the commercial possibilities of spiritual teachings onemorning in the hot tubs at Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, where I wasa group leader. I was commenting to my friend Daniel, a therapist, about howcooperative everyone was in Esalen workshops; as a leader, I could ask my groupsto do virtually anything and they would jump right in and try it. On a lark,Daniel and I discussed creating a new therapy, in which participants would beinstructed in squawking like a chicken. Students would also learn thetheoretical basis behind the technique: how the flapping of the arms stimulatescertain acupuncture meridians, and the contraction of the vocal chords whilesquawking clears out the fifth chakra. As we practiced a few times, withinminutes several people from an adjoining tub approached us and asked us whichworkshop we were in, because they wanted to sign up. We had our first converts!Last August, I walked into a bar at Burning Man, and in order to receive adrink, patrons were asked to roll a pair of dice, and the bartender would tellyou what you had to do. The challenge assigned to me was, “Walk around the roomsquawking like a chicken.” Ha! I thought, they don’t know who they’re dealingwith, the one guy in the room who not only has actually been squawking since wayback, but has actually taught it! (The girl next to me rolled a lucky seven, andshe got to be publicly spanked at the bar.)But apart from obvious and extreme forms of financial exploitation andindulgence, most of us these days don’t think twice about the idea of paying areasonable fee to someone for their time and services, spiritual teachers aswell, perhaps even more so.On my recent book tour a single question kept repeatedly popping up in differentcities, and always in response to my rattling off a humorous and unimaginablylong list of the many different teachers, retreats, workshops, seminars, gurus,ashrams, and techniques I’ve experienced over the last thirty plus years. Thequestion was, “How were you able to afford to do all that?” And underlying thequestion was the implication, “If I could afford to do all that, I’d probably beenlightened by now.”My first answer was to remind the questioner of my Uncle Norbert’s primaryteaching: that God is free. Enlightenment is not for sale, spiritual truths arenot a commodity, and awakening to one’s true nature is not a buyer’s market. Inthis spirit, many teachers in the contemporary American Buddhist world do theirwork for dana, which is the Pali word for generosity. Their teachings areoffered freely, and people may choose to contribute to their support accordingto their own measure, for what is generous to some would be impossible toanother.My old friend Michael Freeman, founder and resident dharma instructor atSouthwest Sangha near Silver City, New Mexico, has been a dana purist for wellover twenty years, supporting himself entirely through voluntary contributions,whether it be for meditation instruction or a carpentry job. His insistence onthis practice once caused a major anxiety attack in an intimate partner when sherealized that not only did her man not have a regular paycheck coming in, but hesometimes received dana contributions in the form of a pair of handmade socks orhomemade carrot cake. Both are lovely, heartfelt expressions of gratitude;neither can be applied toward rent and groceries.To live one’s life that way requires developing a deep trust in life itself, aknowing that one will be taken care of. Those of us who never step off thatledge will never find out if it’s true or not, whether life will indeed supportus. Indiana Jones illustrated this leap of faith perfectly in Indiana Jones andthe Last Crusade when he had to step out over an abyss, and it was only instepping off the spot he was standing on that he released the latch on aplatform that swung up to meet his next step.I unwittingly happened upon this idea while hitchhiking across the UK in myearly twenties. One Friday afternoon it dawned on me that I had run out of cashand the banks would be closed until the following Monday morning. I had alreadyhad enough remarkably generous hitchhiking experiences in the preceding daysthat I had developed an unshakeable trust, and rather than panicking, I realizedthat things would work out and I’d find a bed to sleep in and a way to eat.Minutes later, a casual chat with a family on a beach led to my being invited tojoin them on their weekend holiday, all expenses covered. It felt like grace.In the last number of years, Rabbi David and Shoshana Cooper and I haveexperimented with bringing the spirit of dana to a Jewish context, for surelythe idea of tzedakah, or charity, figures strongly in the Judeo-Christianculture as well. We began offering our twice-yearly seven-day silent Jewishmeditation retreats for dana, and discovered that we would receive as much andusually more than had we charged the usual per-head tuition. There was a greatdifference in feeling, though, in that each envelope we received felt like agift, and in addition, the process enabled those with limited funds to attendthe retreat who would otherwise not be able to. My Uncle Norbert would like theidea.When the people on my book tour asked me how I had been able to afford myextravagant spiritual seeker’s lifestyle for so many years, I explained that Iwas fortunate enough to have been born into a situation where just enough moneyhad been freely given to me so that I always enjoyed the luxury of living arather frugal and modest hippie lifestyle while pretty much doing whatever Iwanted. And as members of the Doughnuts will attest—the Doughnuts being aphilanthropic group composed of those suffering with the burden of great wealththrust upon them, and all the mixed emotions, difficulties, and strings thatcome with it—I always found my financial freedom either a blessing or a curse,depending on how well I was using it. I have always felt extremely driven tosomehow justify my very existence through using what was gifted to me wisely andproductively, something I didn’t always succeed at doing, which would plunge meinto states of great despair.I once asked dharma teacher Christopher Titmuss about it, and he said, “When youcan relate to the money in the same way that you relate to your hand, you willbe free.” Meaning, my hand was given to me this time around, and I don’t have aproblem with it, not a lot of guilt, shame, or issues around having a hand. Itwas given to me, and I simply use it. May God bless the work of my hands, andmay that work be offered freely."},{"pageContent":"20LOCAL CONTROL OF CREDIT: THE FOUNDATION OF ECONOMIC DEMOCRACYTHOMAS H. GRECOThroughout the world today, local communities are struggling to maintain theireconomic vitality and quality of life. The reasons for this are both economicand political, and are largely the result of external forces that are driven byoutside agencies like central governments, central banks, and largetransnational corporations. In brief, decisions made by others outside of thecommunity are having enormous impacts on life within the community. Be that asit may, it is possible for communities to regain a large measure of control overtheir own welfare and to ameliorate the effects of those external forces byemploying peaceful approaches that encourage human solidarity and are based onprivate, voluntary initiative and creativity.I often use the analogy of the small boat harbor to convey the general idea ofhow local communities can protect their small enterprises while remaining opento the global economy. The process of globalization, while having many positiveaspects, has thus far been carried out in such a way as to be destructive tosmall businesses, local economies, and democratic governance. It is as if therewere a policy to remove the breakwaters from every small boat harbor in theworld, the effect of which is to expose small boats to the turbulence of theopen sea. As I put it in one of my lecture presentations—a rising tide may liftall boats, but the tidal wave of globalization smashes all but the biggest.But a healthy global economy and a peaceful world require healthy communities.Is there still a place for small businesses? Must every advantage be given tothe corporate megaliths at the expense of small enterprises? The ancienteconomic debate that poses “free trade” against “protection” is too limiting andoutmoded. Healthy economies require both free trade and protection, eachconfined within its appropriate bounds. Communities must create the equivalentof breakwaters to protect their small enterprises and workers, while at the sametime remaining open to the national and world economies.It is encouraging to note that there has been a recent major awakening about themegacrisis that is developing worldwide, and a plethora of creative responses toit. Sustainability, relocalization, human scale, and the devolution of power arethe current buzz. The big question, of course, is how are they to be achieved inthe face of the tremendous forces that are driving us toward the precipice?APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSadly, the orthodox approach to community economic development over the pastseveral decades has centered upon efforts to recruit some large corporation tocome and set up operations in the local region—with the expectation that theywill provide additional jobs for local people, stimulate business for peripheralindustries and the service sector, and ultimately add to local tax revenues. Theconsequent competition among cities and states in pursuing that strategy hasresulted in corporations wresting enormous concessions from host communities insuch forms as tax abatements and infrastructure provided at taxpayer expense.But capital is notoriously fickle and recent developments have given itunprecedented mobility. Quite often the experience has been for companies toleave town as soon as the free lunch has expired, only to play the same gameagain somewhere else.It is widely acknowledged that, in comparison to large corporations, small andmedium enterprises (SMEs) contribute proportionately more to the economy injobs, productivity, and innovation. According to the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), “SMEs play a major role in economic growthin the OECD area, providing the source for most new jobs. Over 95 percent ofOECD enterprises are SMEs, which account for 60–70 percent of employment in mostcountries. As larger firms downsize and outsource more functions, the weight ofSMEs in the economy is increasing. In addition, productivity growth—andconsequently economic growth—is strongly influenced by the competition inherentin the birth and death, entry and exit of smaller firms.” The same pattern wouldseem to hold in other parts of the world, including America.Doesn’t it therefore make more sense to nurture the businesses that are alreadypart of the local economy? Doesn’t it make sense to support those companies thatare locally owned or managed and have a stake in the prosperity and quality oflife in their home communities? Communities that have a high quality of life, anable workforce, and a clean and pleasant environment do not need to offer bribesto outsiders. Relocalization efforts cannot get very far without the creation ofmetasystems that support buying locally, selling locally, investing locally, andsaving locally. Conventional political forms of money, and huge bankingcompanies that are owned and managed by remote entities, by their very naturemilitate against relocalization. There is no need for antagonistic opposition tothose entities; they can be made less relevant and less destructive byimplementing creative methods that localize control over both exchange andfinance.I propose that groups and organizations that seek to promote healthy,sustainable local economies should make it a priority to organize regionalmutual credit clearing associations as the centerpiece of a comprehensiveprogram. As these associations develop and grow, they will provide their regionswith an increasing measure of independence from the outside forces that controlconventional money and banking, enabling communities to rise above “the race tothe bottom” that has resulted from the kind of globalization that has beenerected and forced upon the world by the World Trade Organization, theInternational Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. The credit clearing exchange isthe key element that enables a community to develop a sustainable economy underlocal control and to maintain a high standard of living and quality of life.The possibilities inherent in such a plan should not be judged by pastexperience with local currencies and other exchange alternatives. Just as amodern jet aircraft bears little resemblance to the Wright brothers’ firstairplane, so too are the more optimized exchange structures I propose unlike anycommunity currency, LETS, or commercial “barter” exchange with which peoplemight be familiar. Based on the principles we have outlined, it is now possibleto engineer and build exchange systems to carry heavy economic loads withinlocal bioregions and to operate them according to sound business principles.This is a multistage project that will proceed in the following sequence: 1. Institute measures that promote import substitution. 2. Provide an alternative payment medium, independent of any political currency and banking establishment. 3. Issue a supplemental regional currency. 4. Develop basic support structures that strengthen the local economy and enhance the community’s quality of life. 5. Develop an independent value standard and unit of account.STAGE I: MAPPING THE TERRITORY & IMPORT SUBSTITUTIONJane Jacobs has argued that cities, not nation states, are the salient economicentities, and that city and regional economies develop through a process ofimport substitution. That being the case, it would seem reasonable that aregional economic development program should begin with actions that supportthat process.The first stage of the development program might look rather conventional andsimilar to some buy local programs of the past, but it will be morecomprehensive in its social, economic, and political aspects. It begins byorganizing solidarity groups that include all sectors of the constituentcommunities—particularly the locally owned and controlled businesses, municipalgovernments, the nonprofit sector, social entrepreneurs, and activists. Bybuilding bridges between these groups and identifying common objectives, itshould be possible to achieve the commitment to do the hard work necessary tomove together toward greater regional economic self-sufficiency.The first major task is to launch a buy local campaign in which the economicresources and business relationships within the region are clearly mapped. Thatdatabase can then be used to assist businesses in finding local sources for thethings they buy and local customers for the things they sell. The services ofbrokers can be employed to help match up supplies with wants and needs. Criticalgaps are identified and local entrepreneurs can be encouraged to find ways tofill them, perhaps with support from a local microlending agency. As thisprocess proceeds, the community becomes less dependent upon outside entities andmore resilient and self-determining.These measures alone, however, are far from sufficient. Given the fact thatconventional money and banking are themselves externally controlled and act inways that are parasitic upon the local economy, some way must be found toreclaim at least a portion of the “credit commons” and bring it under localcontrol. So unlike conventional buy local initiatives, this project movesquickly to implement the second stage.STAGE II: MUTUAL CREDIT CLEARING PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF PAYMENTThe second stage is the most important and unique stage of the project. Itprovides an alternative means of payment based on the community’s own creditthrough the process of direct credit clearing.Working capital in the form of conventional money is always scarce and expensivefor most businesses. Mutual credit clearing is an extension of the commonbusiness practice of selling on “open account,” but it is done on a moreorganized multilateral basis, which has the effect of sharing the risks andenabling a participant’s sales to pay for purchases without the use of anythird-party credit instrument such as conventional money. As a member of amutual credit clearing exchange, a business can have an interest-free line ofcredit, it will be able to acquire the things it needs without the use of cash,and (because it accepts payment in the form of exchange credit) will be apreferred source of supply for others who are members of the exchange.The allocation of credit in a clearing exchange involves the granting of an“overdraft privilege,” which means that a member’s account may have a negativebalance up to some specified limit. In allocating lines of credit, it isimportant (especially in the beginning) to allocate the greatest share of creditto “trusted issuers”—i.e., those that are well established, financially sound,and whose products and services are in greatest demand within the local region.This is the key to maintaining a rapid circulation of credits through thesystem, avoiding defaults, and preventing the excessive accumulation of creditsin the hands of businesses that cannot easily spend them. In brief, thebusinesses that you wish to have accept community credits in payment are theones that should be issuing them in the first place. By beginning with trustedissuers, the value and usefulness of the community credits is quicklydemonstrated beyond any doubt. As the process gains credibility and generalacceptance in the community, more businesses and individuals will want to jointhe credit clearing exchange and as each member develops a trading history theytoo can earn an overdraft privilege commensurate with their volume of saleswithin the system.Like any network, a credit clearing system becomes more valuable and useful asit continues to expand and a greater variety of goods and services becomeavailable within the network. By way of example one may note that the first faxmachine was very expensive—but useless. As more fax machines were deployed andconnected in an expanding network, the fax became more valuable to allusers—even as prices plummeted and quality improved. The same will happen withclearing networks, but it is essential that the network and each node in it beproperly designed and operated from the very start.STAGE III: THE CREDIT OF TRUSTED ISSUERS PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY FORREGIONAL CIRCULATIONThe third stage of the program will be the joint issuance of credits into thegeneral community by the members of the clearing association. This isaccomplished by the association members buying goods and services fromnonmembers who are outside the credit-clearing circle. They make these purchasesby using some form of uniform credit instrument, like a voucher or certificate,which all association members are obliged to redeem—not for cash, but for thegoods and services that are their normal stock in trade. That provides a soundregional currency based on the productive capacity of the region’s leadingenterprises, a currency that can circulate among any and all as a supplementalmedium of exchange. The availability of such a currency to supplement the flowof official money insulates but does not isolate the local economy. Just as abreakwater protects a small boat harbor from the turbulence of the open sea, asound regional currency provides a measure of protection from the turbulence ofthe global economy and centralized banking and finance.This externalization of credits from the clearing association into the generalcommunity can be achieved using any of several available forms and devices.Credits may take the form of paper notes, coupons, vouchers, or certificates;they might be placed on stored value cards like the gift cards that are commonlyissued by major retailers and are so popular these days with consumers; or theycould manifest as credits in accounts that reside on a central server that canbe accessed by use of a debit card and point-of-sale card reader.STAGE IV: SUPPORT STRUCTURES FOR LOCALIZATION—SAVING, INVESTMENT, FINANCE, ANDEDUCATIONWhile the most fundamental need is for mechanisms that enable local control overthe exchange function, the health and independence of local economies alsorequires the localization of savings and investments. In today’s world, locallyowned and managed banks have become increasingly rare, most having been acquiredor replaced by branches of huge bank holding companies that are owned andcontrolled by entities outside the region. Local savings deposited in thosebanks can and do get invested anywhere in the world, often in ways that aredetrimental to the interests of the saver and the health of his or her localeconomy. They often leave homegrown enterprises starved for capital whilefunding mega-corporations, weapons, war, and projects that are socially orenvironmentally destructive. Structures can be created that channel temporarysurpluses of both conventional money and exchange credits into enterprises thatenhance local production and quality of life.Additional support structures are suggested by the experience of the Mondragoncooperatives in the Basque region of northern Spain. Over a period of more thanfifty years, the Mondragon network has grown and thrived on the basis ofcooperation and social solidarity. In addition to more than 250 industrial andservice cooperatives and associated companies, it has developed structures toprovide finance, education, and research in support of its regional cooperativeeconomy. The Caja Laboral Popular (CLP, or Working People’s Bank), for example,is itself a cooperative that invests the savings of the local community andprovides financing for the other cooperative enterprises.STAGE V AND BEYOND: TRANSITION TO AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF VALUE AND ACCOUNTINGUNITEventually, it will become necessary to denominate local credits in someindependent, objective, nonpolitical unit of account based on a concretestandard of value. This will become especially important as political currenciescontinue to be inflated and their monetary units are debased, and as localclearing networks become interlinked regionally and across national boundaries.Trade credit units originally defined as being equivalent to the dominantpolitical currency unit (like dollars, pounds, euros, and yen) will shift overto a value unit that is objectively defined in terms of valuable, commonlytraded commodities. Such a unit will facilitate trading across national bordersby obviating the need for foreign exchange and eliminating the exchange raterisk, and will be immune to the inflationary and deflationary effects that besetnational political currencies.The remaining design details and implementation strategies can be settled uponas the program unfolds. For now, it is sufficient to say that all of thenecessary monetary science is well established and all of the major systemcomponents are readily available. With a modest amount of funding or investment,programs designed along these lines can be quickly launched and a creditclearing system can quickly reach critical mass. It is expected that the successof this model in one or two local regions will inspire others to implement it,leading to a rapid proliferation of healthy and sustainable communities thatmight associate to form a worldwide economic democracy."},{"pageContent":"21A RETURN TO THE VALUE OF BEING HUMANHARDIN TIBBSSEEKING ESCAPEIn March 2007, the BBC broadcast in the UK a three-part documentary called TheTrap, by the controversial British filmmaker Adam Curtis.1[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts001] Its message was that “asimplistic model of human beings as self-seeking, almost robotic, creatures”plus an overriding belief in human selfishness have created “a cage” for humanbeings in modern society. The documentary argued that this predicament is inpart the result of a long process by which social and personal values havebecome dominated by reductionist thinking. The Trap was pessimistic in tone anddid not offer any clear solution. The question it left open, which this paperaddresses, is whether it is possible to reverse this process by establishing abasis for values that would not be reductionistic, and that would offer a wayout of the present trap.REDUCTIONISM AND HUMAN IDENTITYThe root of the problem is that our picture of human beings has been graduallyreshaped by the dominance of one particular mode of thinking—reductionism—as ameans of generating knowledge. What this has caused us to believe and valueabout ourselves in turn shapes how we behave toward each other. If our pictureis somehow inadequate or incomplete, our behavior will also fall short of itsnatural potential and serious social and other problems may develop. This caneasily happen without our noticing it and is not easy to detect or correct.Reductionism is essentially the procedure of reducing things to their componentparts. The idea of taking things apart as a means of finding out more about themhas been an extremely powerful way of building scientific knowledge. Earlyscientists began by looking at easily visible internal structures, and then wedeveloped instruments such as microscopes for looking at parts at smaller andsmaller size scales. This led us to the modern theory of the atom, and beyondthat to subatomic physics, and to the paradoxes of the quantum realm.What we lost sight of in the process is that knowing what things are made ofdoes not necessarily help us to value them appropriately.The basic assumption of reductionism is that a thing really is simply the sum ofits parts. Each part is made of something smaller, right down to the basicbuilding blocks of material reality, the subatomic particles. In this view,everything is a material construct. The properties of multiparticle things areseen as outcomes of system interactions, and thanks to computer simulations wenow know these can be surprising and unpredictable. The features that appear asthings get more elaborate are referred to as “emergent” properties of complexsystems.We see everyday objects around us that have internal structure and are built upfrom smaller parts, and this does apparently explain how their properties arise.This can be seen very clearly with simple machines. If we take a bicycle apartwe are left with a collection of mechanical components and we can see exactlyhow they come together to form the bicycle. The fact that this approach works sowell with machines made it easy to think that it could be applied to livingorganisms without raising any new issues.Simple reductionism sees the properties of the whole as fully determined by theproperties observed in the parts when separate. Complex systems theory refinesthat by saying that although the parts of complex systems determine emergentbehaviors, these new properties must be studied as phenomena in their own right.But in both cases, parts are seen as primal and causal, reflecting a bias thatthe parts somehow exist first and then come together to form the whole.If we ask how the parts of a living system are different from the parts of abicycle, a somewhat deeper answer is that the parts are themselves altered bythe dynamic interaction among the parts in a way that does not happen in abicycle. When the parts are in the living system they are literally differentthan when they are not—we call the latter state “dead.” This suggests a holisticreality in which parts and wholes are interdependent, so that in biologicalsystems the whole can dynamically reshape the parts. An analogy would be thecreative activity of engineering design, in which the parts are shaped as ameans of accomplishing the concept of the whole.Yet even this answer is still subtly framed in terms of parts, whereas a betterway to see living organisms might be as patterns of resonance like holograms.Living organisms are not assembled from parts like a machine—they appear as muchsimpler and smaller formations we call eggs or seeds, and all their internalstructure appears from nowhere as they grow. From a reductionist perspective wehave trouble making sense of this, which suggests that for science to transcendits current limits, it now needs to move beyond reductionism.Nevertheless, in reductionist biology the explanatory arrow goes from parts towholes. Biological organisms clearly have complex internal structure, and dohave parts, although these parts are bound together in a much more intimate waythan the parts of a bicycle, as anyone who has attempted a dissection will know.Dissection—and sometimes vivisection—of living creatures enabled the knowledgebase of biology to be built up, leading eventually to molecular biology, inwhich the operative parts are not bones, muscles, and nerves but the far smallernucleic acids, proteins, and enzymes. It was quickly obvious that the internalstructure of human beings is very similar to that of animals, so similar that weoften talk colloquially about “the human animal.”This similarity, and the effectiveness of reductionism, led to the modernistunderstanding of a human being. We asked ourselves, what is a human being? Andwe answered by saying: human beings are advanced animals. And what are animals?They are systems of life processes. And what are these life processes? Well,they are dynamic systems of atoms and molecules. And so, in a few simple stepswe reduced our idea of a human being to a set of material, atomic phenomena.The largely unseen problem is that when we apply reductionism to livingcreatures, and most significantly to human beings, we inadvertently perform notone but two reductions. The obvious one is that we reduce the living creature toits material components. The other, overlooked one, is that we also reduce ourappreciation of its qualities as a living being. In place of an appreciation ofdistinctive human qualities we are left with a perception of material qualitiesonly. We have reduced our understanding of human beings to the same level as ourunderstanding of material things.There are several qualities of being human that are devalued or even lost whenthis happens. As humans, we are self-aware, able to choose, and the holisticexperience of being human is our unique existential identity. These qualitiescannot be found in the parts that make up a human, or in material constructssuch as bicycles, but can only be appreciated from the standpoint of actuallybeing human. To be able to put the appropriate value on these qualities, we mustuse the holistic experience of being human as our frame of reference and basisof analysis.Instead, our modernist belief in the power of reductionism to develop knowledgeled us to think that the successive steps of the reductionist definition are adisclosure of the truth about being human. We consequently came to regard thematerial aspect of human beings as more real or more fundamental, and thereforemore important and more valuable than other qualities. But the more we seeourselves as material constructs, the more we will begin to treat each other asif this is what we value most about each other.There are many signs that this has happened, and has become one of thedistinguishing marks of modernity. We say that nothing other than materialityexists, and that this is self-evidently true. We deny nonmaterial aspects ofourselves, dissociating ourselves from our own nature. We no longer see uniquelyhuman qualities because we do not take them seriously anymore. We do not treatthem as real in themselves, or as representing primary value; we say that theyonly exist as a by-product of material processes. And as we become dead tovarious human qualities in ourselves, and in others, our society begins to beless and less accommodating to certain aspects of being human. This is thepredicament described in The Trap.We are living in a predominantly modernist culture that admires material andmechanistic qualities more than human ones. It places great value on thequalities of machines—their speed, precision, and efficiency—and we often seethese as better than human attributes. In many contexts we aspire to be as muchlike machines as possible, and sometimes we actually wish to be machines,devising robotic implants and dreaming that we will be able to upload ourconsciousness to silicon and defy death.The shift to this outlook has been gradual, and largely without our noticing wehave ceased to appreciate fully what it is to be human. So much so that thisassertion itself may seem questionable, in spite of our uneasy awareness that itdoes carry some kind of meaning that we cannot quite pin down. The changes,these reductions in the way we see ourselves, have crept up on us gradually. Wedid not see them coming and we do not notice how they alter the way we see theworld and how we behave toward each other. But we do see that there are socialproblems we do not know how to fix, and perhaps we sense that the full depth ofexperiencing life has somehow been diminished.REDUCTIONISM AND THE PROBLEM OF THE WHOLEReductionism has not only had an unintended social impact, but it also limitsour ability to find solutions to the problem of technological impact on thenatural environment. It also helped create this problem in the first place. Theeffectiveness of reductionism in generating practical knowledge enabled us todevelop advanced technologies, which have been a major force behind theexponential growth of industrialization and the spread of modernity. We used ourknowledge almost exclusively to create disrelated instances of appliedtechnology, such as consumer products and infrastructure projects, which we putinto the world without any special thought for their impact on the wholecontext, the larger natural and social environment.For most of the industrial period the larger environmental context was simplynot an issue. When industrialization began, it was a small development in a vastworld that was patterned in ways far beyond human influence or understanding. Wesimply took for granted the preexisting structures and processes that organizedthe world. Even as we poured technology into the world, we thought the patternof the whole would simply take care of itself.This was true up to a point, while the scale of industrial activity compared tothe rest of the world remained small, but from sometime in the 1970s onward therelentless growth of the industrial economy began to overtake the scale of thebiosphere itself. After the 1970s, according to the World Wildlife Fund, webegan to consume renewable natural resources faster than the global capacity toregenerate them. This vast scale of operation meant that the total collection oftechnologies that had been deployed began to disrupt the preexisting pattern ofthe whole.The problem with reductionism is that it generates knowledge about parts that iscapable of disrupting the whole, but this knowledge does not work the other wayround to help us to bring order to the whole. This is illustrated by the way thestructure of a living organism does not arise from its separated parts being puttogether to form a whole, but from the emergence of its parts in the context ofa whole that exists from the outset. Yet so far almost all scientificexploration has been biased toward the parts rather than the whole. This givesus detailed knowledge of the parts, but little insight into how we might fix thedisruption that is caused by the bias in our focus. To address the “problem ofthe whole” we need to find a way of appreciating the value of wholes as wholes.Until we can rebalance the value we put on the whole versus the parts we willnot be able to heal the pathology caused by the entire system of humansocio-technical organization—the disruption of the whole.REDUCTIONISM AND SUSTAINABILITYThese two problems, our picture of human beings as material constructs, and thepathology of the whole, come together as a problem of sustainability. Disruptionto the pattern of the whole is a direct threat to the sustainability ofpresent-day human society. This means reductionist thinking is a key underlyingsource of unsustainability in the world today.This link between reductionism and sustainability should not be surprising.There is a connection between our understanding of what it is to be human andour ability to sustain our lives. If there is a distortion in our picture ofourselves, our sense of our needs will also be distorted, and this will affectour ability to sustain ourselves. This happens through the way we make choicesto meet our needs.One of the attributes of being human is our ability to choose. Most of us, mostof the time, choose to sustain our lives, to keep them going. If our lives arein danger, we will do our best to save ourselves. On a day-to-day basis wechoose to sustain ourselves by making sure our needs are met.Our ability to do this of course depends on our being able to accuratelyidentify and value our various needs. Because in the modernist worldview weconsider the material or physical level of description to be the most real, wevalue our needs at this level more highly than our needs at other levels. Sincewe naturally make the most effort to meet the needs we value most, we then tendto neglect or ignore the remaining needs.If we consistently and systematically fail to meet our full range of needs ashuman beings we are indirectly threatening our ability to sustain ourselves.This unsustainability may not be obvious immediately, because it mostly involvesour nonmaterial needs, whereas a lack of basic material needs causes obviousproblems faster. Nevertheless our shift from a holistic appreciation of humanneeds to a reduced appreciation is an underlying cause of the wider problem ofsystemic unsustainability.AN ANTIDOTE TO REDUCTIONISMIs there an antidote to our bias toward valuing the parts more highly than thewhole? How can we restore our sense of the qualities of the whole, and bringourselves back to a fuller appreciation of what it is to be human? Is there analternative to reductionist thinking that would achieve this?Suppose we throw the sequence of reduction into reverse. Instead of working downthe sequence of levels of description and ending up with material parts as theanswer to our questions about the whole, we could work our way upward toward thewhole, integrating into our understanding of the whole the properties we find ateach level, and crucially, giving equal value to each of the levels.To demonstrate this approach we could take the human being as the paradigm, notleast because it has more levels of qualitative reduction than any other wholesystem we know. We would first set out and then describe each of the levels ofreduction. We would then see various human qualities revealed at each level. Ouraim would be to achieve the sustainability of the whole, and to heal thepathology of the whole, and we have seen how that depends on valuing all ourneeds equally. We would therefore look for the needs we have at each level whenour reality or our identity is considered at that level. This procedure wouldresult in several groups of needs that are qualitatively distinct. We would thenbring these sets of needs together into an integrated whole picture, givingequal value to each set.This process would put all the steps of the reduction back together and buildback up to a much more fully described sense of what it means to be human. Theresult would be a holistic sense of being human, with a balanced sense of allthe needs we as humans value being able to meet. This integrated picture wouldprovide a holistic sense of human value.HUMAN NEEDS AND THE LEVELS OF REDUCTIONHere is how this process would look in practice. We start by setting out thesteps of the reductionist description of a human being:(Level 0) The starting point: we experience ourselves as human beings.We ask: what is a human being?(Level -1) We answer by saying: human beings are advanced animals.We ask next: what are animals?(Level -2) We answer by saying: animals are systems of life processes.We ask next: what are life processes?(Level -3) We answer by saying: they are dynamic systems of atoms and molecules.This gives us four levels of description, starting at the top level with thewhole human being, and ending at the bottom level with material components.Next, we build back up from the lowest level, observing the human qualities andneeds that exist at each level in turn.At the third most reduced level (-3 above), we see the human being as anassembly of atoms. At this level our corresponding needs are the ones met byassemblies of atoms and material constructs. These include basic materialrequirements such as tools, clothes, and infrastructure for functions such astransport and shelter. At this level of human identity the highest meaning ofthings arises from their relation to our physical needs.At the second most reduced level (-2 above), we see the human being as a set ofsystems of life processes. At this level our corresponding needs are ones theones met by systems of life processes. These include a viable biosphere toprovide ongoing life support, and food composed of complex organic compounds. Atthis level of human identity the highest meaning of things arises from theirrelation to our biological needs.At the first most reduced level (-1 above), we see the human as beingessentially an advanced animal. At this level our corresponding needs are theones that we have in common only with animals. These include social contact,social organization, social reciprocity, membership of family groups, andemotional relationships. At this level of human identity the highest meaning ofthings arises from their relation to our social needs.At the nonreduced or whole level (0 above), we see the human being as uniquelyitself, unlike anything else we can compare it with. At this level ourcorresponding needs are the ones met at this level, and unique to humans. Ouruniquely human qualities and attributes include reflexive awareness, abstractknowledge, and the potential for impartial judgment. Our needs include educationand justice, intellectual development, and aesthetic satisfaction. At this levelof human identity the highest meaning of things arises from their relation toour uniquely human needs, what might be called our “cultural” or“civilizational” needs.We can go further and add one level beyond or “above” our experience as humanbeings. We could call this level (+1). This level relates to a question aboutour ultimate identity, about the meaning of being human. We are not able toanswer this question definitively, since we cannot fathom the source of our ownidentity. But perhaps the best answer available to us is that we appear to becreative beings who develop an innate and open-ended individual potentiality andwho therefore need to be free or unconstrained in this by other human beings.Our needs at this level are therefore for freedom of self-realization andself-actualization, in free response to the mystery of creation. At this levelwe might say, although it is hard to pin down an exact definition of the word,that the highest meaning of everything in human experience arises from itsrelation to our “spiritual” needs.This (+1) is not a level of reduction, since it cannot be found when reducingthe system we are dealing with to a description of its parts. Science willtherefore be unable to find it using reductionism as the research mode. Ratherthan being a reduction, it is at a level of integration higher than the whole weare examining, which is why it is referred to as “plus 1.” However paradoxicalthis may be, it is important to include it because it acknowledges somethingfurther about human beings. We are not only aware of ourselves as wholes withunique attributes, but we are also (at least from time to time) aware that thereis something about us that goes beyond our everyday experience of life. At thevery least we are reminded of this because we are repeatedly haunted byquestions about our own identity. This (+1) level provides a way to accommodatethe idea of the “spiritual” and allow for religious needs, without attempting toprecisely define it. However, should we ever want to designate more complexstructure in reality above the human (0) level, the “plus” notation canaccommodate it by means of levels (+2), (+3) etc.The listing of needs at each level given here is intended to be indicative orillustrative, not exhaustive. Further exploration and questioning will no doubtclarify the general or common human needs at each level, and in addition therewill be many specific needs existing in particular situations, locations, andtimes.REINTEGRATING A HOLISTIC VALUATION OF HUMAN NEEDSIf we now take all these groups of needs and bring them together, we canapproximate a holistic picture of human needs.2[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts002] Putting together just the needslisted above, the picture looks like this: As human beings our needs includematerial requirements such as tools, clothes, and infrastructure for functionssuch as transport and shelter; a viable biosphere to provide ongoing lifesupport, and food composed of complex organic compounds; social contact, socialorganization, social reciprocity, membership of family groups, and emotionalrelationships; education and justice, intellectual development, and aestheticsatisfaction; and freedom of self-realization and self-actualization, in freeresponse to the mystery of creation.In bringing together this holistic picture we are no longer trying to define orvalue these needs in terms of each other. In particular we are not trying toexplain the higher ones in terms of the lower ones. The aim is not to explain,but to harmonize functioning wholes, which requires appreciation of thequalities of the functioning whole and the needs related to them. This meansdeveloping the ability to perceive and value all the attributes. The quality ofbeing fully human will only be possible if all the qualities of being human arerecognized, and the needs related to them are valued equally and fully met.We now have the necessary starting point for achieving whole systemsustainability, a procedure for identifying and valuing our full range of needsas human beings. The next step is to consider how we might make use of this tomeet those needs in the practical context of the world, bearing in mind that theexisting pattern of the whole is increasingly disrupted, as described earlier. Amore precise definition of the disruption would be that the world as a whole isno longer able to self-regulate in a manner that will meet human needsindefinitely. We are overshooting planetary limits, and the risk for us is thatif we push the overshoot too far, the biospheric system may crash or insteadself-regulate by sweeping us out of the picture—this is the “revenge of Gaia”scenario.3 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts003] What we are lookingfor therefore is a process that enables human beings to relate to the wholesystem of the world in such a way that it can self-regulate and indefinitelymeet (or allow us to provide for) human needs as it does so.TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN PROCESS FOR SUSTAINABILITYAs individual human beings, we look to our surroundings to meet many of ourneeds. Our need for clean air is met by the functioning of the biosphere, whileour need for human contact is met through our association with other humanbeings. At an earlier stage of human history our needs were directly met throughthe natural functioning of the larger ecosystem in which we live, just as withanimals living in their natural habitat. As human societies developed, wecreated increasingly specialized economic and technological systems for meetingour needs—and the needs of some at the expense of others—and these operatedinside and depended on the global set of natural ecosystems.These human-technology-based subsystems, which could be classed as ecostructuresalong with beavers’ dams and spiders’ webs,4[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts004] were developed without specialthought about the functioning of the natural global ecosystem, because, asalready discussed, in the early stages of industrial growth this kind ofthinking simply wasn’t necessary. At our current stage, however, industry hasgrown to span the planet, and involves physical flows of material that are aslarge as the flows of material within the natural global ecosystem. It is nowessential that we do address the impact we have on the whole context withinwhich we operate—the planetary biogeochemical system, or more simply the naturalglobal ecosystem.The “pathology of the whole” is a disturbance of the entire biosphere, as wellbeing the social issue described in The Trap. Life of some kind will no doubtsurvive the present period despite our environmental depredations, but we as aspecies are far more fragile than life in general. Our practical concern ashuman beings is that the planet remains habitable for us, and for the highlydeveloped ecosystems that support us, and that something close to our currentcivilization can continue. It is certainly not in our interest for the planetaryeco-climatic conditions to break down. If Gaia “strikes back” by moving beyondthe range we can tolerate, we will be in serious trouble.In principle it should be possible to maintain human civilization, for severalreasons. One is that we can now make adequate material provision for everyonebecause our technological capability allows us to overcome the material scarcitythat existed before. Basic resources are still unequally accessible only becausesocial belief and politics are lagging behind our actual capability. The socialand psychological work of overcoming our outdated and now dangerous belief infundamental scarcity is one of the most important tasks of the present century.The brunt of this task is now to master collectively the emotions of fear andgreed that are fed by the belief in scarcity and that drive much dysfunctionalpolitical and corporate decision-making.A second reason is that we now have a great deal of scientific knowledge abouthow the world works and how our own technological activities have an impact. Ifwe design ingeniously it is entirely within our ability to configure our appliedtechnologies to coexist respectfully with the natural processes of thebiosphere.To keep the planet habitable we must now aim not only for our own humanwell-being but also the well-being of the whole system of which we are a part.This aim will mean finding ways of meeting our needs that are in line with threeprinciples: first, that the meeting of any one need does not compromise themeeting of any other need; second, that the meeting of any one person’s needsdoes not compromise the meeting of any other person’s needs; and third, that themeeting of human needs in general does not compromise any of the attributes ofthe world—such as a functioning biosphere—that enable our needs to be met.A further reason is that the world actually or potentially contains everythingwe need. The reason we are able to meet our needs at all is because there arematching attributes in the world around us. If we recognize our needs fully andplace an equal value on meeting them all, we will be obliged to look after allthe corresponding aspects of the world as a whole. If we can avoid putting allour stress on one set of needs—as we have been doing—we should be able todevelop processes for meeting our needs that will also bring the world intobalance.The steps in doing this are first that we develop a holistic sense of our ownneeds, and second that we design integrated systems that can meet our needs andat the same time form part of the balance and functioning of the whole. This isessentially how the natural ecosystem as a whole is already organized, so wecould say that we are looking for an ecosystemic form of organization for humanlife within the planetary ecosystem. By analogy with computer operating systems,we could think of this as an ecosystemic operating system for planet earth.Ecosystems in general are systems that meet the needs of their participants (ofwhatever species) through mutual interaction and reciprocity. The first part ofthe word ecosystem is derived from the Greek word for household, oikos. Thegeneral idea behind the word is of a system whereby the household runs. So,without going too far from its biological sense, we could think of the wordecosystem as representing a “home-locality needs-meeting system.” The varioushuman needs–meeting subsystems could then be thought of as subsidiary ecosystemswithin the natural global ecosystem. Using the word ecosystem signifies thatthese systems can meet needs and also interact cooperatively with the overallglobal ecosystem.The process of designing these ecosystems would start with an assessment ofhuman needs. The same basic needs exist everywhere, but the specifics differ ineach locality and community, and for each organization in meeting the needs ofits members and those it serves. Every group, community, or organizationapplying this approach would have to carry out its own detailed needs assessmentat its own scale of operation and at each level of description (as discussedearlier). Because of the range of knowledge required—from ecology to socialscience—the assessment team would need to comprise individuals with expertise inthe various need areas. The process would have to be open and participatory, toensure that all the needs of everyone affected would be represented. Theassessment would involve the subjective appraisal of needs by a group of people.This assessment could be based on emerging protocols such as “consensus design”in architecture as developed by Christopher Day, and the “science of qualities”being pioneered by the biologist Brian Goodwin.5[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts005]A locally relevant needs-meeting system—a local ecosystem—would then be designedand developed for meeting each group of needs (the rationale for a local focusis discussed below). Material-level needs (Level -3) would be met by anindustrial ecosystem;6 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts006]life-support needs (Level -2) by a bio-agricultural ecosystem; social needs(Level -1) by a social reciprocity ecosystem; and human-level needs (level 0) bya human development ecosystem. (The ability to pursue needs at the more elusive+1 level would be assured by freedoms of individual religious and spiritualinquiry and practice, always operating within the criteria of noninterferencewith the meeting of other human needs.)The design of these ecosystems would use and synthesize the existing range ofhuman knowledge. They would mesh with each other so that the functioning of oneecosystem would not compromise the functioning of any other (through an emphasison design ingenuity rather than trade-off, as described by Roger Martin in TheOpposable Mind.)7 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c21-nts007] They wouldalso mesh with the larger surrounding or adjacent ecosystems of each type.Meshing with local and larger-scale natural ecosystems would be achieved byfeatures that would sustain and restore natural ecosystems rather than merelyexploiting or degrading them. Protocols such as The Natural Step, a Swedishsustainability method, would provide the design criteria for eco-compatibility.EMERGENCE OF A CELLULAR ECONOMYThe integration or meshing of the four types of ecosystem would be achieved by adesign synthesis of industrial ecosystems, bio-agricultural ecosystems, socialreciprocity ecosystems, and human development ecosystems, coming together into ageneral socio-economic and governance system that is itself nested in andcompatible with local and global natural ecosystems. These combined ecosystemscould then be called “general ecosystems.” General ecosystems would be definedas integrated systems that provide the essential needs of a human group,community, or organization in a locally comprehensive, autonomously directed,and ecologically sound way.The focus on localness does not imply that everything would be restricted tolocal scale, merely that locally scaled general ecosystems would be the basicbuilding bricks or “cells” of the larger system. The economy and society as awhole would be structured as a mosaic of these cellular subsystems, which wouldbe the primary units of organization. These cells would be communities organizedto meet the full range of human needs locally, not in a quest forself-sufficiency, but simply to ensure that all the needs are indeed met, animportant distinction. An element of self-sufficiency would be needed for this,but most cells would also specialize in activities or production that could beexported to other cells, while importing other specialized offerings—somewhatlike the role of cells in the body.The prospect of trade between cells raises the question of money. In our presentmarket economy, money is regarded as the primary means of accessing needs. Acellular economy built up from general ecosystems would be a system designed tomeet needs through its intrinsic structure, so the role of money would be lessdominant.Money is a means of accounting for certain types of human interactions, so if werevalue our sense of being human, many types of relationships would bedemonetized as they become less transactional. The design of general ecosystemswould allow this by raising the general level of social reciprocity. Thisimplies that the use of money for many everyday activities would be greatlyreduced.At the moment money reinforces reductionism. We increasingly think we can use itto obtain all our needs, a view encouraged by consumerism, despite the oldadmonition that money cannot buy happiness. Money is literally somethingmaterial, and just as we have allowed our material-level needs (Level -3) todominate, we have allowed money itself to determine our sense of human needs.This is what happens when we say that something cannot be done because it isuneconomic. In a revalued cellular economy we might override such a view toassert that something should be done even though it is “uneconomic” in ourcurrent sense of the term.In a cellular economy money is likely to be used very flexibly. For examplelocal non-fiat currencies might be used in the design of general ecosystems totrack the provision of specific needs. If trade between cells requiresconversion of value from one money system to another this might well be carriedout differently. At the moment exchange rates are determined by markettransactions that reflect the money surplus or deficit position of differentareas, in effect a value comparison based on material-level needs (Level -3). Acellular economy might override this material-level dominance. For instance,exchange rates might be set by equalizing the local cost of a selection of foodsthat provide a day’s calorie intake (say 2,000 calories) in the two differentareas. This would ensure that trade was always fair in terms of its effect onnutrition, which is not the case today.In short, money is likely to be less important in a cellular economy, but whereit is present it would be used to express a human rather than a materialapproach to value.APPROPRIATE SCALESuccessful general ecosystem cells would not simply grow in size by “scaling”like growing businesses. As cellular subsystems they would spread byreplication, not by gigantism, through independent re-creation of the entireecosystemic cell. If a particular general ecosystem design proved successful,other communities could reproduce it. Expansion by whole system replicationwhile keeping the cell size small would be vital to preserve the essentialfeature of the general ecosystem—its ability to meet the full range of humanneeds by organizing locally. At larger size scales—eco-regional, national, andsupranational—the society and economy would be a patchwork of similar anddissimilar but complementary ecosystemic cells linked by mutual trade.Part of the rationale for the primacy of local scale is that a variety offactors and trends indicate that future economic and social relocalization mightbe both desirable and feasible. This can be seen on a variety of fronts.Socially, relatively small groups form the primary unit of structure. Forexample, cross-cultural studies in sociology and anthropology indicate that themaximum size of a genuine social network such as a village is about 150 members,and this is known as the “Rule of 150” or Dunbar’s Number. This number may berelated to the average human ability to recognize people and keep track ofemotional information about all members of a group. Agriculturally, if basicfoods are grown locally they are fresh and seasonal, with correspondingecological and health benefits. Industrially, in spite of the well-known conceptof economy of scale concept, recent thinking about flexible demand-led “leanmanufacturing” leads to smaller plants close to consumers, rather than hugecentralized plants at a distance. Technological developments such as 3-Dprinting are also heading in this direction, as production equipment becomessmaller and more flexible. Various economies of scale still exist, but theviable scale of manufacturing is progressively reducing in size as technologyadvances. In economics, the success of industrial clusters also emphasizes thevalue of local scale. Politically too, the smooth functioning of democraticsystems depends on the vitality of local political engagement.The exact size or scale implied by “local” is suggested by these factors but notprecisely defined. A balance would need to be struck between a scale smallenough for certain kinds of human interrelatedness, and large enough for certainactivities to have a minimum viable size. A working definition of local could beexpressed in, say, numbers of people, geographic area, or travel time, but thesefactors all interrelate and change over time. Historical analysis of humansettlements shows that their average radius has been roughly equal to thedistance that could be traveled in half an hour by the prevailing transporttechnology. As transport speed has increased, so has the population size oftowns and cities, so they no longer offer a good social definition of local.Their ecological footprint has also vastly expanded. This scale problem inspiredthe “new urbanism movement,” an urban planning initiative that designsvillage-like urban layouts clustered around rapid transit stations. The conceptof general ecosystems goes beyond this, potentially being something like alocalized integration of village-like urban form, economically independentproduction clusters, closed-loop recycling, ecologically balanced foodproduction, intimate social scale, and civic self-governance.The ultimate benchmark for the scale of locally focused socio-economicorganization is the individual’s experience of how human needs are met. Imaginea child growing up in a community organized as a general ecosystem. Because thesystem would meet all the fundamental needs of the people in the community, thechild would experience a high quality of life. He or she would be able to seedirectly, as part of everyday experience, how the entire system worked and wasoperated by people belonging to the community. Much of the child’s educationwould involve witnessing how all the important parts of the system weredesigned, created, interrelated, and maintained. This would be much more likelyto foster a feeling of personal involvement and responsibility, ecologicalawareness, economic autonomy, local political self-determination, and give acomprehensive insight into the way the world works. In these terms, local mightbe both justified and defined as whatever scale of general ecosystem allowed achild to have this kind of experience growing up.In preindustrial times, most children grew up on farms or in small towns andvillages, where they would directly witness how things were made, how food wasgrown, how social order emerges among animals, and what distinguishes humans.However, they may not have experienced a high level of social justice andmobility, or the freedom to develop themselves. The modern era has made greatheadway toward these things, but at the cost for most people of anycomprehensive sense of how the world as a whole works, and with a loss of anyreal sense of participation and responsibility. Some form of general ecosystemicorganization might therefore be the key characteristic of a future “transmodernera” that would combine the benefits of modernity with a restored sense ofdirect personal participation and the security of belonging to a coherentcommunity.These speculative thoughts about general ecosystems are intended as anexploration of future possibilities rather than a prediction of the future.Building on a way of revalidating the full range of human needs, the generalecosystem concept is a possible framework for organizing society to meet humanneeds in full.CONCLUSIONWe live in a world in which most needs of most people in most places are notfully met. The forces of modernity that shaped our world have given usunrivalled power to meet human needs, yet the shortfall persists and the generalsituation becomes steadily more chaotic.We try to solve our increasingly complex problems by throwing more money at themto deploy more physical resources. Our overemphasis on the physical oftenactually crowds out and reduces our ability to meet other needs. Ever more moneyis soaked up and the problems remain. Despite our vastly increased technologicalcapabilities we have a growing “problem of the whole” that we do not know how toaddress.Before the industrial era we did not have to worry about this. The “pattern ofthe whole” was simply inherited from the historical past. Social and economicrelationships, and the relationship of humans to their natural environment, werenot things that anyone consciously thought out. The roots of these things hadarisen in the immemorial past, and most people regarded them as God-given, alongwith nature itself.In the modern period, scientific knowledge and technology expanded into the oldunconsciously shaped world and progressively cut away its moorings. We nowurgently need to respond to the growing chaos of the whole with a consciouslydetermined repatterning, but we have no obvious pattern to follow. We have agreatly expanded view of human agency, and a repertoire of sophisticated andpowerful tools. But we lack an organizing pattern that combines our scientificknowledge with wisdom about our place in the whole.In order to resolve this impasse, it is useful to heed the admonition attributedto Albert Einstein: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we usedwhen we created them.” The mode of thinking primarily responsible for creatingour current predicament is the application of reductionism as a means ofgenerating knowledge. Although successful in many ways, it has had the unwantedeffect of gradually reducing our picture of human beings, changing how we valueourselves and others.The corrective response suggested here centers on a revaluation of human beingsand a corresponding reintegration of human needs. It builds on this to propose asimple but comprehensive pattern of organization that has the potential toprovide a new fundamental framework for achieving socio-economic continuity andecological sustainability.The pattern of the whole for which we search is the same as the pattern ofourselves. Once we recognize our needs fully and place an equal value on meetingthem all, we will be obliged to look after all the corresponding aspects of theworld as a whole, which actually or potentially contains everything we need.The message of The Trap was that our reductionist model of human beings hascreated a cage for human beings in modern society. Our release, and our abilityto solve “the problem of the whole,” now depend on rediscovering the wholenessof being human and applying it in our relationships with each other and with theworld as a whole."},{"pageContent":"22ORIGINAL WEALTH AND PEOPLE’S CAPITALISMSTEVE BHAERMANNot surprisingly, America’s founders had a deep understanding of “naturaleconomy,” acknowledging that nature’s renewable wealth was abundant and onlyneeded tending and harvesting from humans willing to do the work. Consider thefreedom this provided. In the Old World, land was held strictly by lords andhereditary landowners. Ordinary people had absolutely no chance to acquire land,and consequently could never become wealthy.In the New World, land was everywhere. And while it could be rightfully arguedthat this land was being wrested from the native peoples, and parts of ityielded wealth only through the hard work of slaves, it still provided a rareopportunity in a “dominate or be dominated” world. Two centuries before Darwin,economic Darwinism was in full flower. Beginning with Columbus’s journey,followed by the explorers of Spain, Portugal, Holland, and England, the NewWorld was first of all a source of gold. That gold made Spain a wealthy nation,and indirectly led to “enlightening up” the Dark Ages.England got into the act in 1600, when Queen Elizabeth founded the East IndiaCompany, the purpose of which, according to agrarian economist Charles Walters,was to “plunder the planet.”1 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c22-nts001]For along with the “divine right” of royalty came the divine right to everythingthat could be acquired. The New World was not only a source of gold, but asource of free land, free food, and “subhuman savages” who could either beharnessed to the plow or dispensed with. Here is a quote from Columbus himselfthat illuminates the five hundred years of history that followed his journey:“[The Indians] are the best people in the world and above all thegentlest—without knowledge of evil—nor do they murder and steal. They would makefine servants. With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them dowhatever we want.” Perhaps the philosopher who first observed that the road tohell is paved with good intentions should really have said: “The road to hell ispaved with people with good intentions—who were used as paving stones by peoplewith bad intentions.”Nonetheless, there were several factors that made the North American coloniesunique. First, many of the settlers were refugees from either religious oreconomic persecution, and in the colonies they had the freedom to experience“live and let live” as opposed to “dominate or be dominated.” They were alsoinfluenced by the native peoples—particularly the Iroquois Nation—who had anadvanced system for living in balance with nature and with each other. Thesenative cultures informed the Enlightenment, and these enlightened ideas becamethe founding principles of what would become the United States.In a world where England and the other European nations saw exploitation as thenatural scheme of things, America’s founders had a more enlightenedunderstanding of how to thrive without exploiting or being exploited. WroteBenjamin Franklin, “There seem to be but three Ways for a Nation to acquireWealth. The first is by War as the Romans did in plundering their conqueredNeighbours. This is Robbery. The second by Commerce which is generally Cheating.The third by Agriculture the only honest Way; wherein Man receives a realIncrease of the Seed thrown into the Ground, in a kind of continual Miraclewrought by the Hand of God in his favour, as a Reward for his innocent Life, andvirtuous Industry.”BIG BOX STORES, EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STYLEJust as the Revolutionary War was fought to overcome economic exploitation, theUnited States itself was founded for the specific purpose of protecting andnurturing its own wealth that came from what this new land yielded. In theperiod 1783 to 1789, the newly freed colonies suffered a severe economicdepression. Why? Because British merchants were flooding the colonies with cheapgoods made by cheap labor, sharply undercutting the growing industries here.Does this sound familiar? More than two hundred years ago, the 1700s version ofbig box stores was putting America’s neighborhood outfits out of business!Here were the colonies that had so recently lost blood and fortune to gainpolitical independence, and were now being recolonized by the economic tyrannyof cheap goods. While then as now, cheap goods were attractive, the bargain camewith a hidden price tag. The influx of cheap goods drove prices down in thecolonies, caused businesses to fail, and resulted in widespread unemployment.People without wages had little buying power, and that reinforced the market forcheap goods, “cheapening” the entire American economy. Meanwhile, in thecolonies or factories where these goods were being produced, workers, natives,and land were being exploited—that is, used without fair compensation. As aresult there was a loss on both ends, with only the middleman gaining from bothtransactions.Consequently, the United States of America was created to protect the mostunique economy in the world against “free trade” just as we might erect a fencearound a newly planted garden to keep the deer from nipping it in the bud. Incontrast with the predator economies of Europe that sought to take wealth fromothers through force and leveraged trade, here was a new nation where it wasunderstood that wealth was on the ground and in the ground, available to allwilling to work it.The nations of Europe resented this upstart start-up nation that had the nerveto imagine it could be economically independent. When Abraham Lincoln decided toissue “greenbacks”—fiat currency without gold backing—to finance the Civil War,a London The Times editorial fulminated, “It will pay off debts and be withoutdebt.… [and] become prosperous without precedent.… That government must bedestroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.” What America wasfounded on—and what has now been severely compromised by greed,misunderstanding, and manipulation—is what economist Carl H. Wilken called“people’s capitalism.” Although little remembered now, Wilken was a visionaryvoice in the wilderness at a time when America was making the choice once andfor all to move from a generative economy to a predatory one.Wilken’s ideas were based on the simple contention that “all new wealth comesfrom the soil.” Even in the cyber economy we find ourselves caught up in today,without the goods that come from the earth life would perish. As BenjaminFranklin understood, agriculture is “manna” from the ground up. Every year, asif by magic, edible life springs up from the ground. Cultivation of thisabundant wealth—and being paid fairly for it—is the foundation of people’scapitalism. Writing in the 1930s, Wilken contrasted this with two other forms ofcapitalism, state capitalism and international capitalism. In statecapitalism—typified by socialism and communism—the state owns the means ofproduction, and runs the system from the top down. International capitalism,typified today by international banks and multinational corporations, isconcerned only with profits, and these profits are too often based onexploitation. People’s capitalism meant building wealth from the land. Thefunction of the government, at least as the founding fathers saw it, was to“protect the individual against exploitation of a more powerful neighbor.”Congress and only Congress was authorized to coin money, money that was notcreated out of debt but which accurately represented the value of the wealth ofthe nation. Living in this age of multinational corporations, many of us mayhave developed a jaundiced view of capitalism. But Wilken saw a nation of sixmillion capitalist farmers, all growing not just their crops, but the wealth andsavings of the whole country.THE AMERICAN DEVOLUTION: FROM ORIGINAL WEALTH TO ORIGINAL DEBT“From 1700 to 1800,” said Wilken’s associate Charles Ray, “our nation’sfarmer-pioneers were creating the first basic capital in the wealth of [America]by raw labor out of the soil.” E. H. Taylor, editor of Country Gentleman, calledthis bounty of raw materials “original wealth.” And yet, two centuries later theUnited States, the most powerful empire in the world, has an economy socompromised it can only function through massive infusions of debt. Whereas ourparents and grandparents enjoyed a high standard of living fifty years ago onone income, it now takes two-and-a-half incomes to even approach that standardof living. The money most families once put aside for savings now goes to repaydebt. What went wrong?The subtext of American history from this country’s founding until 1913 was thestruggle between those who wanted banks in charge of monetary policy and thosewho wanted the government of the people to determine how much currency wascoined. The battle was decisively won by the banks in 1913, when the FederalReserve was established, insuring that U.S. currency would be debt-based andissued through private banks.A year later, the World War began in Europe and European bankers had loaned theAllied powers $15 billion. But by 1916, the war was going poorly for the Alliesand the bankers needed two things to secure their loans. First, they needed forthe United States to enter the war and shift the balance of power toward theAllies. Second, they needed for America to loan the Allies an additional $15billion from the U.S. Treasury. And so Woodrow Wilson, the man who ran forpresident in 1916 on the platform “he kept us out of war” (not, we should note,“he’s gonna keep us out of war”) got us into war on April 6, 1917, just weeksafter his inauguration. America’s “victory” in that war may have set the countryon the road to ruin. At the end of the war, the Allied powers were victorious,but bankrupt. Without money, they had to repay the United States in goods. Well,goods are good, right? Not exactly. At a time when America was alreadyprosperous and self-sufficient, Congress lowered the tariffs in order to importthe goods and collect the war debts. From 1919 to 1929, America imported $43billion in goods—and that meant $43 billion that our own industries weren’tearning. Plants closed, and by late 1929 there were twelve million unemployed.Meanwhile, European banks had $3.5 billion on deposit in U.S. banks. When they“drafted” those reserves, America’s banks were caught short. And the economichouse of cards came tumbling down.And so by 1932—less than two decades after the establishment of the FederalReserve—America’s economy had experienced all of the disasters that a nationalbank was supposed to have prevented. The farming community was devastated byoverwhelming debt and falling land prices. Factories were closed, and banks weregoing bankrupt. National income dropped 52 percent, and one-quarter of America’sworkforce was unemployed.According to Stephen Zarlenga, director of the American Monetary Institute, “Inthat horrendous climate many economists were aware that the banking systemcaused the problem and major changes were needed.”2[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c22-nts002] At this challenging moment,Henry Simons at the University of Chicago assembled the “greatest economic mindsof the country.” The plan they came up with became known as “the Chicago Plan,”and was circulated to a thousand academic economists across the country. Ofthose who responded, 235 agreed with the plan, 40 agreed with some reservations,and only 45 disapproved.The Plan was harshly critical of the banking system of the time, stating, “Ifthe purpose of money and credit were to discourage the exchange of goods andservices, to destroy periodically the wealth produced, to frustrate and tripthose who save, our present monetary system (does that) most effectively!”As for prescriptions, they were radical: 1. Only the government would create money. Fractional reserves—the mechanism banks had used to “create” money—would be abolished. Banks would essentially be warehousing money and charging a fee for their services. 2. Lending—the province of the banks—would be separate from money creation. This would prevent banks from “borrowing short” and “lending long,” another way that banks created money out of thin air and were able to pull the rug out on ordinary people when money “tightened” again. 3. An important distinction was made between money and credit. During the early years of the Depression, defaulted loans and reduced borrowing artificially shrunk the money supply. This is why there was work to do, but too little money to pay for it. Separating money and credit would greatly stabilize the economy, possibly preventing future depressions.The plan called for the money to flow right into the banks, many of which hadhad to close their doors because of “runs” when their customers demanded morecash than they had on hand. Under this plan, the banks would be paying interestto the government instead of the other way around. The banks would still be ableto make reasonable profit through making loans. The Chicago Plan would havereturned America to the original notion of the founding fathers—that it was thegovernment (representing the will of sovereign citizens) that would issue themoney, and this money would reflect the value of the real wealth in the economy.This money supply would not be subject to the manipulation of the “moneychangers” for their own benefit.The Plan was enthusiastically supported by the “best economic minds” of the era.Paul Douglas—later a U.S. Senator from Illinois—wrote, “This proposal will ofcourse be opposed by the bankers from whom it takes the lucrative privilege ofcreating purchasing power. It would however insure the safety of deposits, givelarge revenues to the government, provide complete social control over monetarymatters and prevent abnormal fluctuations in the capital market. At the sametime it would permit the allocation of productive resources … to remainprimarily in private hands. All in all it seems the most promising program forthe reform of our monetary and credit system …” A young Milton Friedman became awell-known advocate of the plan, writing, “… the creation of fiat currencyshould be a government monopoly.”So what happened? How did the Chicago Plan go the way of the Chicago Plan forthe Cubs to win the World Series? Quite simply, it was an idea whose time hadnot yet come, and those who benefited from the old system were able to mobilizetheir resources to prevail. Although legislation was submitted to Congress, thelegislation languished and not even its sponsors—like Senator Bronson Cutting ofNew Mexico—could articulate it well. No one bothered to present it to the peoplethemselves because no one imagined they could understand it.Meanwhile, the bankers and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr.convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the plan was unworkable andsteered him to another economic guru, John Maynard Keynes, whose approach was tokeep the bankers in power but soften the impact of economic vicissitudes on thepublic. “Keynes,” writes Zarlenga, “was therefore not revolutionary except inrelation to the utter backwardness of the financial establishment.”Keynes, like most economists at the time, believed that investment runs theeconomy. The more money made available for investment, the more the economycould grow, even if that investment money was borrowed. “We’re borrowing fromourselves,” the saying went. Unfortunately, what this really meant was that “wethe people” would end up owing large sums of money to “we the very, very fewpeople.”In contrast, the raw materials economists like Wilken tried to make the pointthat no economy could be based on debt. The foundation of a healthy economy, heargued, was “earned income based on the parity monetization of raw materials,”meaning that real wealth comes from the tangible products we bring forth fromthe earth, and a fair price paid to those who do the extracting. An exactingmathematician, Wilken came up with a formula that would accurately predictAmerica’s national income fourteen years running: national income was alwaysroughly seven times the farm income.He explained it this way: The earth is the only producer of “original wealth,”meaning that the earth gives her yield without charging interest. Each season,new wealth is infused into the economy. The farmer is the first earner and firstspender of that wealth, which “reverberates” through the economy. The farmerpays the feed store owner, pays for farm equipment, and buys clothes, etc.,fueling the prosperity throughout the local community. Meanwhile, as this newharvest is distributed more people make money and more communities benefit, allthe way down to the local grocer or supermarket. Think of it this way. If therewere no food to sell, Whole Foods would have to call themselves Whole Nothing.Food is the basic “fuel” for our economy because it is the most constantly andconsistently consumed item.Consider further that if a farmer raises one hundred bushels of corn and getspaid ten dollars a bushel, this infuses one thousand dollars into the economy.But what if—in the name of lower food prices—the farmer only gets five dollars abushel? That means that only five hundred dollars is infused into the economy,half as much. To prove his point, Wilken pointed to the farm income in 1929—thelast year before the Depression—and in 1932. Farm income dropped from $11billion in 1929 to $5 billion in 1932, and yet production remained the same! Theonly difference was a loss in buying power.As Wilken loved to point out, a bushel of corn at five dollars had just as manycalories as a bushel at ten dollars. In a pamphlet called The Key to Prosperity,Wilken wrote that America could have any level of prosperity it desired as longas it remembered this seven-to-one ratio of national income to farm income. “Aparity—or equal exchange,” he wrote, “is not simply a matter of fairness to thepeople engaged in agriculture. It is a matter of direct self-interest to thosein every other group in America.”AMERICA’S NEAR-DEBT EXPERIENCEHowever, in the midst of a grave economic emergency, President Roosevelt chose adifferent path. He launched a massive public works campaign that may well haveprevented a fascist or communist revolution during these times. Following theKeynesian model, he infused money into the system through organizations like theWorks Progress Administration (WPA) and young unemployed workers helped buildour national parks system and other valuable infrastructure. Young writers andphotographers were also paid to do cultural history projects (such as interviewswith the dwindling population of ex-slaves), and these too have added toAmerica’s collective knowledge and intelligence. But the problem with thisprogram was the same problem we are suffering from today. They were alldebt-based.“Debt,” Wilken warned, “is a mortgage against the income of future generations.”But in the end, the “international capitalists” were too strong and thepersistent belief system of “unregulated private business” and “free marketsystem” prevailed, while ironically government spending skyrocketed! In a trendthat began at the beginning of the twentieth century, American capitalistsaccelerated investment in exploitative enterprises overseas, and have usedAmerica’s military might to secure these investments.This has resulted in a geometrically multiplying loss for the United States,even as it’s become the most formidable military power in the world. The lossesare threefold. First, America has lost its own foundation in people’scapitalism. Farming is now largely factory farming, as rural population is now10 percent of what it was a century ago. Secondly, in its place we have adebt-based house-of-cards economy that is kept in place by our military might.That military has cost us $15 trillion since the end of World War II. Andspeaking of debt, our military operations—overt and covert—around the world havegreatly increased our karmic debt because they have been largely and tragicallyin service of the interests of exploitation.THE NURTURING ECONOMYSo, at a juncture when not just America but the world is crying out for a neweconomics, what have we learned? And how can this learning help us design asystem that reflects nurturing rather than exploitative values?The first thing we learn from America’s experience is that borrowing to consumeis unnatural. The body, for example, only has so many energy resources. Any new“investment”—repair of infrastructure or creation of new cells—must be done withavailable cash (food being digested) or savings (fat and nutrients stored in thebody).That’s why animals do not reproduce if they’re not sufficiently nourished. Howdo we know? Well, consider that when young women who are anorexic reach acertain level of malnutrition, their periods stop. It’s nature’s way of sayingthat unless you “pay for” your body’s current operating expenses, there are nosavings available to manufacture a new being. The second important learning—thereally good news, in fact—is that on this planet, the source of all wealth isthe energy from the sun, and the food from the earth. All else is derivative.And this is really great news because both of these resources—understood andmanaged properly—are infinitely renewable. As sure as the sun comes up in themorning, solar power is available, either “new” or “used.” As Thom Hartmannpointed out in his book of the same title, the oil we are burning today—inever-dwindling supply—represents “the last hours of ancient sunlight.” And whilewe may be running out of stored sunlight, there is an abundance of fresh stuffcoming our way daily. Says Dennis Hayes, former director of the U.S. SolarEnergy Research Institute, says, “No country uses as much energy as is containedin the sunlight that strikes its buildings each day.”Because the sun also controls atmospheric dynamics, wind energy too is “solar,”and—as long as the sun comes to work every morning—renewable as well. Accordingto a 1997 U.S. Department of Energy report, three states—North Dakota, Kansas,and Texas—had “enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national electricityneeds.” However, according to Lester Brown, that was a “misunderestimation”based on technology that existed in the 1990s. Advances in wind turbine designsnow indicate that wind power in just these three states could meet America’sentire national energy demand.Furthermore, energy consultant Harry Braun suggests that because these windturbines are so similar to auto engines, Detroit’s auto industry could regear tomass-produce these on an assembly line. This could drop the cost ofwind-generated electricity two cents a kilowatt hour! Lester Brown suggests thatby shifting current energy industry subsidies—e.g., the current $210 billionyearly fossil fuel subsidies—this new technology can be developed.3[Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c22-nts003]What stand in the way of this development are the same things that have kept thedominator economy in place long since it’s outlived its uselessness: (1) Aninfluential and powerful minority benefits from it; (2) The vast majority of therest of us have been myth-led to believe that this is the way things have alwaysbeen and always must be.Part of what has kept the current economic system in place is the persistentbelief in scarcity. With 6.5 billion people on the planet, how could we possiblegrow enough food for all? The answer is simple and natural. The goal is for eachcommunity everywhere to be sustainable, and food and energy self-sufficient. Ifthe sun and soil are the sources of all wealth, then a healthy, wealthycommonwealth begins with every community having access to this abundance. On oneend of the spectrum, it means the end of exploitive monoculture economies whereresources are extracted without the proper payment, and local sustainablefarming is marginal at best. On the other end—in the most urbanized andghettoized areas of our country—food must be grown locally, as a thrivingbusiness opportunity. Consider the empty lots in cities like Philadelphia andDetroit, and the possibilities for growing food and sending it up the economicfood chain as this food is sold, processed, and delivered.If we’ve learned anything from people’s capitalism and the laws of biology it isthat when “cells” are allowed to thrive, the entire organism thrives. Thosetop-down attempts to force collectivism have been miserable failures. However,when individuals cooperate together voluntarily, and when they are allowed togain a fair price for their labor, communities thrive and the commonwealthbuilds. The body cares for all participating cells, and so participation is key.REGROWING YOUR GARDENHow, then, do I participate and regrow my garden?Once again, rather than answers we offer more questions for us each to askourselves: What is it that truly brings me happiness? What is of value, and whatis worth having? Each time “I want” comes up, the next question is, And if I hadthat, what would it do for me? What beliefs are keeping my status quo in place?What fears or concerns? How can I downscale my footprint and upscale my life?How can I use less and at the same time increase my happiness? This is trickybecause there is such a persistent invisible belief in sacrifice anddeprivation. So the game is, whatever you choose must not just make yourfootprint smaller, but must make your life better. Self-fulfillment is far moresatisfying than selfish feel-fullment.How can I educate myself, and help educate others? In a world where we areincreasingly seeing that all things are related, we can no longer discountthings that are out of our comfort zones, whether those involve economics,politics, or spirituality. In these wildly transformational times, we might dobetter embracing our “discomfort zone” so we become more comfortable with thediscomfort of change.As we allow the “myth-perceptions” of obsolete economic thinking to fall by thewayside, we can recognize how all systems—economy, ecology, banking, healthcare, education, defense—are really one conversation: how do we, individuallyand collectively, use our resources wisely for the well-being of all? Why?Because in a healthy, caring system a “health care system” requires a fractionof the resource it currently uses, because prevention is far cheaper than cure.And that brings us to a final lesson we can learn from the natural economy. Justas surely as international capitalism (corporatism) is proving itself incapableof delivering us into a healthy new world, the same is true of state capitalism(i.e., communism). In a natural economy based on extraction, production, anddistribution of real (renewable) resources, the forms of organization likewisearise from the grassroots up. Consider that in villages and rural communitiesthe world over, some form of barn raising is commonplace. Independent entities(in this case, farmers) recognize their interdependence, and combine voluntarilyto assist one another.The future of economics, not to mention our species, involves growing anoncoercive, nongovernmental public movement of voluntary cooperation that willweave all the functional and productive aspects of economy into a true web ofmass-construction that will make us all interdependently wealthy. This isalready happening via the slow money movement, Transition Towns, and buy localalliances. These alliances often transcend old political polarities, and combinethe most functional aspects of libertarian conservatism and progressiveliberalism. Regardless of what this new economic system is called, it willinvolve two things: wisely using the resources of nature, and wisely using theresources of human nature. In order to maximize the renewable original wealth ofthe sun and earth, we will need to mobilize and apply the unique gifts ourspecies brings to the world: love and imagination. Through imagination, wecreate sustainable technology. Through love, we multiply the goodness throughoutthe system so that we need fewer goods to feel good. We recognize that the mostsustainable form of economic growth is growing happiness.May we grow happier, as we embrace our mission to tend the garden we have beengiven, and fruitfully multiply the “common wealth” instead of fruitlesslyscrapping over the scraps."},{"pageContent":"23TOWARD A SPIRITUAL ECONOMICSAMIT GOSWAMIIt does not take a genius to see that capitalist economics as practiced today isat a crisis point. Present-day capitalism is based on continuous growth andexpansion that require unlimited resources; this cannot be sustained on a finiteplanet. (In fact, the finitude of resources may already have caught up with us.)This expansion produces higher and higher standards of living, and wages cannotkeep up without producing inflation. To meet the demands of higher standards andtheir higher cost, people are forced to give up their other needs, such as theneed of children for quality time with a parent or the need of adults forleisure time to pursue meaning. Thus, and invariably, some of the basic promisesof capitalism are shortchanged by the nature of the beast itself.Capitalism recognizes one basic need for people: the survival and security oftheir physical bodies. This basic ego need requires private property—and anyeconomics that ignores this basic need of people is bound to fail. But as thepsychologist Abraham Maslow pointed out, we have an entire hierarchy of needsbeyond the body. One major defect of capitalist economics is the ignoring of thepeople’s higher needs. Following Maslow, but modifying his theory according tothe insights of my general approach to spirituality—science withinconsciousness—we can easily see what these higher needs are.OUR REDEFINED HIGHER NEEDS AND THE RUDIMENTS OF A SPIRITUAL ECONOMICSConsciousness is the foundation of all being, and its possibilities arefourfold: material (which we sense); vital energy (which we feel, primarilythrough the chakras and secondarily through the brain); mental meaning (which wethink); and supramental (which we intuit). “Supramental” includes discriminatingcontexts, such as physical laws, as well as contexts of meaning and feeling,such as ethics, love, and aesthetics. The material aspects of experience aresometimes called “gross”; the rest make up the “subtle” domain of ourexperience.When consciousness chooses the actual event of its experience out of thesepossibilities (material, vital, mental, and supramental), the physical has theopportunity to represent the subtle. The material is like computer hardware; thesubtle is software. Our capacity for making material or physical representationof the subtle evolves. Our capacity for making representations of the vitalevolved through the evolution of life via more and more sophisticated organs torepresent living functions such as maintenance and reproduction. Next, thecapacity of making more and more sophisticated representations of the mentalevolved. This is the stage of evolution we are in right now. Our capacityeffortlessly to represent the supramental has not evolved yet. However, there isevolutionary pressure on us to move in this direction; it is the primary reasonsome of us are attracted to spirituality.In this way, there must be an urge to satisfy not only physical needs but alsothe needs of all the other dimensions of our experience. Thus a spiritualeconomics must address the satisfaction of emotional needs both conditioned andunconditioned (positive emotions such as love, compassion, and satisfactionitself); the pursuit of meaning, including the pursuit of new mental meaningthat requires creativity; and the pursuit of spiritual and supramental (soul)needs such as altruism, aesthetics, and happiness.And in truth, this ladder of needs is not entirely hierarchical. If onesatisfies higher needs, the urge to satisfy lower needs actually decreases. Butif a lower need is satisfied, the demand for satisfying a higher need increases.In this way, a strategy for an economics more suitable than capitalism would beto address all of our needs simultaneously.Whereas capitalism is an economics of physical well-being based on thesatisfaction of our conditioned physical ego-needs, idealist or spiritualeconomics must be an economics of holistic well-being based on the satisfactionof both our (physical) ego needs and higher needs (pertaining to the explorationof the vital, mental, soul, and spirit).MICROECONOMICS OF THE SUBTLEEconomics is about production and consumption, supply and demand, prices and soforth. How does all of this relate to our subtle needs? Let’s talk about thesemicro-details.Production of positive vital energy can be accomplished in many ways:forestation (plants and trees have abundant vital energy), cultivating positivehealth in society (people of positive health radiate vital energy), and soforth.1 [Pinc_9781583943502_epub_nts_r1.htm#c23-nts001] But the best way toensure production of vital energy is to encourage ordinary workplaces to offerfacilities for their employees to practice positive health, including space foryoga, tai chi, and meditation. As for production of mental meaning, we alreadyhave some things in place in the arts and entertainment industries. Both ofthese industries have the capacity to produce positive vital energy (positiveemotions); however, they have largely been bogged down with the negativity of amaterialist culture. But we can shift the emphasis from negativity tomeaningfulness and positivity.The production of supramental and spiritual energy requires more effort todaythan it used to. In the olden days, spiritual organizations like churches,temples, synagogues, mosques, and the like cultivated and produced supramentaland spiritual intelligence in their leaders and practitioners. Nowadays, theseorganizations are more interested in influencing mundane politics than ininvesting in the supramental. But make no mistake about it; it can be done,although we may have to develop new spiritual organizations to do it. In theolden days, perhaps the most effective means of production (and dissemination)of supramental energy were travelling monks (called sadhus in India; troubadoursare an example in the West). This we can revive; to some extent the many new ageconferences on spirituality are already serving this purpose. Also effective aregroup meditations, through which (as some of parapsychologist Dean Radin’sexperiments show) people can experience nonlocal consciousness and hence cantake creative leaps to the supramental domain. This can be done even inworkplaces.Now to the question of consumption. Because the vital and mental are mappable inus, they can be consumed both by local and nonlocal means. For example, if wesee good theater, it cultivates the processing of meaning in us, even newmeaning. When we partake of good, meaningful entertainment, we also feelpositive emotions; we are consuming them. As we consume, we ourselves have thepotential to become producers.Supramental energy consumption is nonlocal, but it requires local triggers.There are scientists who subscribe to the so-called Maharishi effect, accordingto which the spiritual and supramental energy generated by a group meditation isconsumed automatically in the local vicinity. There have been claims of crimereduction in big cities where Transcendental Meditation groups perform suchmeditation. However, this is controversial and I am not advocating it. A purelyquantum-mechanical consumption of your spiritual energy requires that I becorrelated with you by some means or other. For example, experiments by Mexicanneurophysiologist Jacobo Grinberg suggest that if two people practice meditativeintention together, they become so correlated—but it should be simpler thanthat. There are many anecdotes of people who have felt peace in the presence ofa sage (I myself have experienced this). So just being locally present maytrigger consumption.The best part of the story of subtle energy products is that it is mostly free.The subtle dimensions have no limits; we can consume a sage’s love all we wish,and the supply is not going to diminish. There is no zero-sum game in thesubtle. Since there might be a bit of material cost of production, we might puta material price tag on subtle products to offset this—and that may not be sucha bad idea, because it enables people to be more serious about their intentionswhen they consume subtle products. This would also be an opportunity for thegovernment to subsidize the subtle industry, for example, in the form of taxexemption or research grants.DOES SPIRITUAL ECONOMICS SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF CAPITALISM?But how can spiritual economics—the economics of the subtle—address the problemsof capitalism I articulated earlier? First, let’s look at the problem of limitedresources. Capitalistic growth economics depends crucially on keeping consumerdemands going; this is often accomplished by creating artificial physical needs,such as new annual fashions for women’s garments. It is very wasteful anddetrimental to finite resources.In spiritual economics, when people’s higher needs are met—even partially—theirphysical needs reduce, reducing the demand for consumption and thus reducing thewastage of limited material resources. The economy still expands—but in thehigher planes, where resources are unlimited (there is no limit on love andsatisfaction).There is another, related problem with capitalism and material-expansioneconomics: environmental pollution. This is a tricky one. In the short term,production of pollution helps expand the economy by creating pollution cleanupsectors of the economy. Believe it or not, the Exxon Valdez oil spill disasteractually produced an economic boom in Alaska. But in the long run, environmentalpollution on a finite planet is bound to end up with a doomsday of reckoning.Many environmentalists think that global warming has already reached doomsdaycriticality. In spiritual economics, material consumption is reduced, thusautomatically reducing environmental pollution.Next, let us consider the free market. Why isn’t it free in the way Adam Smithenvisioned? The truth is, a really free market has large ups and downs—but ademocratic government must level out these business cycles in order to survive;voters wouldn’t allow them to go unchecked. So the government intervenes, eitherthrough the Keynesian approach (tax the rich and increase government programs toincrease jobs and economic movements) or the supply-side approach (reduce taxfor the rich; the rich will invest, producing economic activity that willtrickle down to the poor). If these steps require deficit financing, so be it.Now, nothing is wrong with government intervention per se. Adam Smith himselfwas quite aware of this: he suggested government intervention to reduce unjustincome distribution, to ensure that the entry to the free market is really freeeven for the small entrepreneur (regulation against monopoly, for example), andto provide liberal education to everyone participating in the market.Governments today tinker with the free market in a few other ways that AdamSmith may not have approved of: they make bureaucratic regulations, bail out bigcompanies from bankruptcy, and give tax incentives to segments of the economycounter to the spirit of capitalism. The problem with this kind of tinkering isthe indefinite-growth economics that we seem to have become stuck on. I havealready commented on how spiritual economics solves this problem.More recently, the freedom of the market has been affected by more than thistraditional sort of tinkering. Materialism has produced a wound in ourcollective psyche, one which has released the powerful among us from the searchfor mental meaning to the slavery of our instinctual greed, avarice, andcompetitiveness. One of the effects of this is the gross corruption of thepractices that keep the market free. The current practice is to managecorruption through laws, but this has very limited success. The other effect issubtle.There is now an active counter-evolutionary movement for taking away meaningprocessing from large segments of people. Right now, this is more of an Americanphenomenon, but it may soon spread to other developed economies with strongcurrencies. Americans have been in a unique situation since the gold standardshifted to the dollar standard. Americans can borrow money to buy resources andgoods from other countries almost indefinitely because those countries have fewoptions other than reinvesting their money in the American dollar and theAmerican economy. The American government then has the capacity for largeamounts of deficit financing—and it is using this deficit financing to cut taxesfor the rich. This is not immediately detrimental to the economy, because therich are the biggest consumers and they are also big investors. But the practicemakes the gap between rich and poor larger and tends to eliminate the middleclass. In this way, market share is becoming more concentrated in the hands ofthe rich, and a new class system is being created. Can traditional capitalismfunction when the capital becomes concentrated again as it did under feudalismor a mercantile economy?Spiritual economics would foster a universal revival of idealist values; insteadof dealing with the symptoms of the materialist wound, such as corruption, weshould rather heal the wound so that the symptoms disappear. For example, takethe case of deficit financing; right now it is being used to increase the wealthgap between rich and poor, contrary to the spirit of capitalism. Even worse,deficit financing removes the very important economic constraint against nationswith aggressive ideas. George W. Bush’s Iraq war would not have been possible ifdeficit financing were not permitted. So should we be against deficit financingin spiritual economics? Not necessarily. How does spiritual economics deal witha government that creates income disparity between rich and poor or startsaggressive wars? In an idealist society, the root cause for a government’sactively creating income disparity or war—negative emotion—would be addressed,and attempts would be made to eliminate them by creating an oversupply ofpositive emotions. Through spiritual economics, we would then use deficitfinancing to eliminate income disparity (as Adam Smith envisioned) as far aspracticable without affecting the proper functioning of the economy—nationallyand internationally—so long as the deficit increase or decrease remains within afew percentage points of the increase or decrease of the Gross National Product(GNP).Next, let’s take up the subject of multinational corporations. Multinationalcorporations have access to cheap labor in underdeveloped economies employed byshifting manufacturing to underdeveloped countries, outsourcing, etc. The laborthus loses the leverage of wage increase through negotiations with management,since the labor laws are very different in underdeveloped countries because ofeconomic necessities. The labor of developed countries lose leverage, too,because of increasing fear of outsourcing of jobs.In order to subject multinationals to uniform management labor practices, weneed to turn from nation-state economies to international economic unions (butnot necessarily with a single currency, like the European Union). In otherwords, the tendency of spiritual economics would be to move toward a singleinternational economic union within which individual democracies would functionwith political and cultural uniqueness and sovereignty but with increasedcooperation.Finally, there is the important subject of the other counter-evolutionarytendency of capitalistic expansion economy—loss of the worker’s leisure time.Spiritual economics has a built-in constraint on expansion, as already noted, sothe standard of living does not have to keep moving up at rates faster than wageincreases. Even more importantly, spiritual economics values other needs andtheir satisfaction that require leisure time. So in this economics, “standard ofliving” is defined differently; increases are measured not in the materialdimension but in the higher dimensions—holistic well-being—without compromisingthe worker’s leisure time.REDEFINING THE GNPHow can we quantify holistic well-being? For our material needs, the GNP is afairly good indicator of progress or decline. But can we generalize the conceptof GNP for spiritual economics?Most people believe that science only relates to the material world, becauseonly the material can be quantified, can be measured reliably. We have toeradicate this prejudice. We may not be able to measure vital energy, prana, orchi in the same sense that we can measure a quantity of rice, but it is not truethat we cannot measure it at all. For example, when vital energy moves out ofyou, you notice certain feelings at the particular chakra; the same is true ofvital energy excesses. When vital energy moves out of the navel chakra, you feelinsecurity, butterflies in the stomach. When vital energy moves into the samechakra, the feeling is quite different, that of self-confidence or pride.Similarly, meaning processing gives you a feeling of satisfaction in the crownchakra because vital energy moves into the body there. So we can quantifymeaning to some extent by the “amount” of satisfaction we derive from processingit.Even the supramental can be measured. If we altruistically perform a good deedfor someone, we feel happy or blissful—not because there is any particularinflux of vitality in any of the chakras, but because our separateness ismomentarily gone. With love, it is even easier, because we not only feel thebliss of not being separate from the whole, but we also feel vital energy in theheart chakra. And both can be measured.Of course, this kind of measurement is not accurate; it is indeed subjective andalways a little vague. But if we remove the prejudice that only accurate andobjective measurements count, what then? Then we can certainly establishcriteria to judge a nation’s net gain or loss of currency (feeling, meaning, andgodliness) in the subtle domain. We must note that quantum physics has alreadyreplaced complete objectivity (strong objectivity) with weak objectivity, inwhich subjectivity is permitted so long as we make sure that our conclusions donot depend upon particular subjects.For example, we can send questionnaires to people to keep an ongoing tab ontheir feelings, meanings, and supramental experiences or lack thereof. When wetally all this for the entire year, we can easily calculate an index of vital,mental, and supramental well-being. This index would then complement the GNP,which is the index for our material well-being. In the same way, we can estimatethe contribution to the vital, mental, and supramental energies from aparticular production organization.Some examples will show that well-being in the subtle dimensions really doescount, and we are missing something in our economics because we do not count it.In the Native American culture of old, there was so much subtle wealth thatnobody even cared to own material wealth. Native Americans treated materialwealth in the same way as subtle wealth: globally, collectively, and withoutplaying a zero-sum game.In Hindu India (before the tenth century), the country and culture werefundamentally spiritual. The economy was feudal, of course, but according to allaccounts (not only of indigenous people but also of foreign visitors) peoplewere satisfied and happy despite the prevalence of the caste system. What gives?Hindu India certainly had wealth, but no more than today’s America. In aspiritual culture, lot of good vital energy, mental meaning, and spiritualwholeness is generated—that is the reason. The subtle wealth reduced the needfor material wealth and more than made up for the lack of it. The same was truefor Tibet until the recent takeover by China.Of course, the Indian and Tibetan cultures are not perfect, because they didlimit the meaning processing of the lower classes; so evolution of consciousnesseventually caught up with them. But so much energy was generated in the subtledomains in the Indian culture that even today, at a time when there is realpoverty in the material domain, the Indian poor are still able to manage,because they continue to inherit and maintain their subtle wealth. If Karl Marxhad seen that, it might make him rethink whether the exploited classes arealways unhappy!HOW SPIRITUAL ECONOMICS SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF THE BUSINESS CYCLEEarlier I mentioned the business cycle, which is commonly referred to as aboom-and-bust cycle. In the nineteenth century, after some years of growth,capitalist economies seemed to fall into a recession. An even deeper stagnation(called depression) eventually happened in the early twentieth century. It is toprevent this kind of fluctuation that the cures of Keynesian and supply-sidegovernment intervention were proposed. With these cures, recessions stillhappen, but they have been milder, (except for the 2007–2008 recession.)However, these cures have created a perpetual-expansion economy. Becauserecovery depends almost entirely on consumerism, a perpetual drain of planetaryresources has been created.In a spiritual economy, since production of subtle products is cheap, in timesof recession we could soften the blow by increasing production in the subtlesector (for example, through collective production of vital energy, ormeditation by a large group), so that consumption in that sector would alsoincrease. This would reduce demand in the material sector, giving businessestime to regroup and increase material productivity. But most people enjoy thesubtle and transformative practices for awhile. In a matter of a few months,they reach a plateau. By the end of a year or so, most people have had enoughtransformation for now, and they are ready to resume “real work.”In the same way, in “boom” times the production of material goods wouldincrease, material consumerism would increase, and there would be fewer subtlegoods produced and consumed. As the economy recovered, people’s material needswould be satisfied again, and they would once again become hungry for thesatisfaction of their subtle needs, whose production would then increase. Thiswould have the effect of putting a damper on the inflationary tendencies of“boom” times in a capitalist economy. The important thing is that there would beno subtle price for the subtle goods; there would be no inflationary pressure inthe subtle dimensions. Paying attention to the subtle would just enable theentire economy to soften the blow of both recessions and boom time inflationarypressure. In other words, cyclical variations of the economy would be much lesssevere, so mild that little or no government intervention would be needed tokeep the economy in a steady state. I am convinced that spiritualizing theeconomy is the way to accomplish a stable economy, something that manyeconomists have thought impossible to achieve.The million dollar question is, How do we go about replacing capitalisteconomics with this spiritual economics?IMPLEMENTATION: WHEN AND HOW?You might think, “Spiritual economics sounds good; it brings together spiritualvalues with the best of capitalism. But how is it going to be implemented? Bythe government? By social revolution, as with Marxist economics? By a paradigmshift in the academic practices of economics?”But let’s begin with a different question: How did capitalism come to replacefeudalism and the mercantile economy? Capitalism was first implemented notbecause of a social revolution or because academics welcomed the idea butbecause capitalism served the purpose of a modernist, adventurous people. Duringthe period in which capitalism developed, people had begun to embark on newadventures of mind and meaning, as science broke free from religiousauthorities; and as this meaning exploration opened up, it was necessary to makecapital available to innovative people and keep it available. Compared tofeudalism or the mercantile economy (Adam Smith’s term for the economy prevalentin England in his time), in which the pursuit of meaning is highly limited andvast numbers of people are denied it, capitalism offered larger numbers ofpeople the economic freedom and flexibility needed to pursue meaning in theirlives. Hence capitalism was inevitable.Spiritual economics is inevitable for implementation because our society needsit, just as capitalism was once inevitable because the society of its timeneeded it. As our society moves beyond our competitive ego needs, as we heal thewounds created by materialism, as we begin to explore the benefits ofcooperation en masse, the old competitive capitalist economics must give way toa new economics in which competition exists simultaneously with cooperation,each in its own sphere of influence.To understand this, we need to look at how any economics is really implemented:businesses, of course. It is how business is done that provides the drive forthe change in economics. And vice versa: the change in economics helpsbusinesses along. Each is essential to the other.So what will enable spiritual economics to replace capitalism? Ultimately, it isthe need of the workplace, the businesses. And there, if you look, you will findample evidence that business is already changing its ways. Yes, competition willcontinue to exist; without it there would be no market economy. But in theworkplace, inside how a business is run, we increasingly find a differentphilosophy and a different aspect of the human being at work. In many of ourbusinesses, we have discovered the value of creativity, leisure, love,cooperation, and happiness.The modernism of Adam Smith’s time has given way to postmodernism andtrans-modernism. The old-fashioned exploration and expansion found in thematerial world are practically over in the face of finite resources and thechallenges of environmental pollution. But while the old frontier is gone, thereis a new frontier on the horizon, one that belongs to the subtle dimensions ofthe human being—and one that requires a subtler, spiritual economics."},{"pageContent":"NOTESCHAPTER 3 1.

This was done for instance in the U.S.during the late 1980s during the Savings & Loan debacle, and it worked asplanned. It enabled the banks to rebuild their balance sheets. Notice that sucha use of funds doesn’t do much to motivate banks to lend to the business sector,and thereby alleviate the “second wave” effect. Furthermore, even thisrelatively “mild” crisis (representing a bailout of 3.7 percent of GNP) tookmore than six years to be absorbed. 6.

Ecologists thenapplied these same flow concepts and analyses to ecosystems, only to haveeconomists later reapply these enhanced energy understandings to economics. Odum(1971, 1984), Hannon (1973), and Costanza (1980), for example, have all usedthermodynamics and flow-network analysis as the basis for understanding theactivities in both economic and ecosystem networks; and Georgescu-Roegen (1971)developed an entire thermodynamic foundation for economics.16.
