Accor ding to the sacr ed calendar of the Ma yan and T oltec civilizations of Mesoamer ica, this date signifies the end of a “Gr eat Cycle” of mor e than fi ve thousand y ear s, the conclusion of one w orld age and the beg inning of the next. Traditionally , the completion of the Gr eat Cycle w as associated with the r etur n of the Mesoamer ican deity Quetzalcoatl, “So vereign Plumed Ser pent, ” depicted in sculptur es and temple fr iezes as a fusion of bird and snak e, repr esenting the union of spir it and matter . Mexican ar chaeolo gist Enr ique Flor escano wr ites: “Quetzalcoatl is the god who hands do wn ci v­ ilization, r eveals time , and discer ns the mo vement of the star s and human destin y.” The h ypothesis I pr opose is that the completion of the Gr eat Cy­ cle and the r etur n of Quetzalcoatl ar e ar chetypes, and their underlying meaning points to ward a shift in the natur e of the psyche . If this theor y is cor rect, the transfor mation of our consciousness will lead to the rapid cr e­ ation, de velopment, and dissemination of new institutions and social str uc­ tur es, cor responding to our ne w le vel of mind.

After all, in only the last tw o centur ies, the surf ace of the Ear th has been r e­ shaped, pa ved o ver, penetrated b y human thought—thought pr ojected into mater ial for m b y incr easingly po werful technolo gies. If we were to exper i­ ence a change in our w ay of thinking, the w orld could be transfor med once again. Appr oaching this subject r equir es “uninhibited finger s for the unf ath­ omab le,” to bor row a phrase fr om the philosopher Friedr ich Nietzsche . It was Nietzsche , that solitar y visionar y and destr oyer of false v alues, who noted that m uch of what w e tak e for kno wledge—e ven in science—is ac­ tually a pr ojection of our psycholo gy onto the w orld. Our thinking tends to circle ar ound estab lished con ventions whose basis is forgotten or obscur e. Nietzsche pr oposed that the attainment of kno wledge r equir es a “solid, granite foundation of ignorance” for its unfolding—“the will to kno wledge on the foundation of a far mor e po werful will: the will to ignorance , to the uncer tain, to the untr ue! Not as its opposite , but—as its r efinement!” As I am seeking to define a change in the natur e of consciousness, ther e is only one medium in which this change can be r egister ed: within consciousness itself , the mer cur ial domain of our subjecti ve and per sonal exper ience—the g round of all exper ience , in f act.

In m y crisis, I scanned m y past for a clue I had lost, a glar ing wr ong- tur ning. What w as the missing piece of the puzzle? W as ther e e ven a miss­ ing piece? It seemed to me that ther e might be lost modalities of consciousness, in­ con venient possibilities of being, suppr essed b y the s warming distractions and anxieties of contemporar y life . Out of desperation, I found m yself recall­ ing the handful of psychedelic v oyages I had tak en at college .

Dean Radin, dir ector of the Consciousness Resear ch Laborator y at the Uni versity of Ne vada, has compiled and analyzed the statistical e vidence for “psi” phenomena, pr esenting the data in his 1997 book, The Conscious Uni­ verse: The Scientific Truth of Psyc hic Phenomena. Accor ding to his meticulous study , thousands of exper iments in telepath y, preco gnition, and clair voyance have fulfilled the scientific r equir ements of verifiability and r epeatability , indicating that these phenomena do , in f act, exist, and can be measur ed. It is not just a small coter ie of cranks who appr ove these r esults. The data w as combed thr ough b y U.S. government panels of scientific exper ts, including pr ofessional sk eptics, in the 1980s and 1990s. The Cong ressional Resear ch Ser vice , in 1981, concluded: “Recent exper iments in r emote vie wing and other studies in parapsycholo gy suggest that ther e exists an ‘in­ terconnecti veness’ of the human mind with other minds and with matter . This inter connecti veness w ould appear to be functional in natur e and am­ plified b y intent and emotion. ” Accor ding to the Ar my Resear ch Institute (1985): “The bottom line is that the data r evie wed in [this] r epor t constitute gen uine scientific anomalies for which no one has an adequate explanation or set of explanations . . . their theor etical (and e ventually , their practical) implications ar e enor mous. ” The w eight of evidence impelled the Amer i­ can Institutes for Resear ch, r evie wing declassified studies in psi r esear ch perfor med b y the CIA, to r ecommend to the U .S.

Ther e is little benefit to con­ tinuing exper iments designed to offer pr oof .” In The Conscious Univ erse , Radin examines the underlying biases, in­ grained pr ejudices, and m ultiple mechanisms that cause the e vidence for psychic phenomena to be ignor ed and suppr essed. Some of these mecha­ nisms ar e psycholo gical and some ar e pr ofessional—scientists, lik e those in other fields, contend for r esear ch g rants and academic positions, and those who tak e on un usual or her etic causes ar e often r ejected b y the system.

If, as successful scientists and academic philosopher s such as J ohn Searle insist, “the brain causes consciousness, ” and consciousness is limited to the brain, what mechanism w ould allo w for telepath y, preco gnition, r emote vie wing, and the host of other effects that ha ve been documented? By shielding their subjects or separating them b y large distances, exper iments in psychic phenomena ha ve demonstrated that these phenomena cannot be caused b y any type of physical “w aves,” whether consisting of electr omagnetism or any other for m of energy . Faced with such parado xes, most of us choose to accept the def ault set­ ting that mak es life easiest, while r educing our exposur e to r idicule . The contemporar y w orld besieges us with w orries and w ork that seem imme­ diately impor tant to our success and sur vival. Few of us ha ve time to mak e our o wn in vestigation of such abstr use r ealms as psychic r esear ch—and wh y would w e bother , when our “exper ts” assur e us the y ha ve the situation wrapped up?

This is not usually a consider ed decision, b ut a sub lim­ inal response designed to r educe our exposur e to “co gniti ve dissonance .” The mater ialist vie w is suppor ted not just b y the mainstr eam media, which tends to ward knee-jerk dismissal of psychic phenomena, b ut b y a har d cor e of skeptical scientists who contin ue to asser t that an y e vidence for psi is the r esult of “bad science”—e ven when those r esults ar e pub lished in peer-r evie wed science jour nals that suppor t the same science the y consider to be “good. ” Another r esponse fr om sk eptics, when f aced with the statistical e vidence , is to argue that, while something un usual seems to be happening in these exper iments, it is not impor tant enough to mer it our attention. Radin disag rees, noting, “effects that ar e or iginally obser ved as w eak ma y be tur ned into extr emely str ong effects after the y ar e better under stood.

Our ability to utilize these capacities—for healing, telepa­ thy, telekinesis, and other pur poses—could de velop rapidly . Befor e I began m y study of shamanism, I w as agnostic about psychic phenomena, and did not r eally car e m uch about the subject.

The per ceiving subject could no longer be separated from the objects under in vestigation. The ph ysicist W erner Heisenberg codified this under standing in his Uncer tainty Pr inciple: W ith quantum objects such as photons and electr ons, it w as impossib le to deter mine both their position and their momentum.

This choice seemed to ha ve a r etroacti ve effect on the natur e of the beam, which still r evealed itself either as w ave or par ticle , depending on the sci­ entist’ s choice . The exper iment demonstrated that quantum phenomena exist only in potentia, until a decision is made , by conscious choice , as to how the y ar e to be per ceived—e ven if this choice is made r etroacti vely. Al­ though this immediate and nonlocal effect happens be yond the speed of light, Heisenberg r ealized it does not violate the la ws of causality because no signal can be transmitted in such a w ay. “Ma y the uni verse in some sense be ‘br ought into being’ b y the par ticipation of those who par ticipate?” Wheeler w onder ed. The existence of a four-dimensional space-time contin uum means that what w e per ceive as the linear dir ection of time is only an illusion cr eated by our par ticular per specti ve. As the ph ysicist Ar thur Eddington put it, back in the 1920s, “Ev ents do not happen; the y ar e just ther e, and w e come acr oss them. ” Elaborating on this concept, Louis de Br oglie wr ote:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 Daniel Pinchbeck In space-time e verything which for each of us constitutes the past, the pr esent, and the futur e is g iven en b loc . . . .

These included the 1974 best seller The T ao of Physics by the ph ysicist Fritjof Capra, and Mysticism and the New Ph ysics (1983) b y Michael T albot. Despite its concer n with “the essen­ tial natur e of things, ” the subject of physics had al ways seemed abstr use to me , and I had ne ver pur sued this ar ea of inquir y. The moder n fragmentation of kno wledge into man y disciplines, each with its o wn specialist discour se, g ives us the belief , or illusion, that w e cannot attain an integ rated under standing of our r eality . As the poet W al­ lace Ste vens put it, “The squir ming f acts exceed the squamous mind. ” I as­ sumed that the concepts of physics, based on complex equations and exper iments with super-accelerator s, could not be r educed into or dinar y language , made sensib le to a generalist such as m yself , without defor ming them. I kne w, ho wever, that these concepts had ex erted a po werful effect on m y father’ s vision, taking per manent hold of his imag ination. His early works depicted simple r ectangles on a flat pictur e plane , calling to mind the early nonobjecti ve explorations made b y Russian Supr ematist painter s such as Kasimir Male vich. In his later w ork he w as obsessed with v olume and mass, painting g igantic menhir-lik e shapes of shimmer ing color that cur ved and fused with the fields ar ound them. He w as seeking to captur e the space-bending effects of gravity , the inter penetration of diaphanous for ms suggesting energy in constant transfor mation. In The T ao of Physics , which de veloped out of the author’ s initial in­ sights dur ing explorations of psychedelic “po wer plants, ” Capra explor es various concepts in Hinduism, T aoism, and Buddhism and cor relates them with the w orldvie w implied b y the disco veries of quantum ph ysics. He finds that these ancient traditions r eflect the quantum under standing of in­ terrelated and inseparab le phenomena, of the centrality of consciousness to the w orld, and the unity of all appearances in a domain that transcends space-time . Although Hinduism descr ibes a pantheon of gods, all of these gods ar e ultimately expr essions of a single pr inciple , Brahman, the unitar y consciousness that per vades e verything, “the one without a second. ” In Hinduism, the w orld of appearance in which w e live is “lila, ” the divine pla y of the gods. “Brahman is the g reat mag ician who transfor ms himself into the w orld and he perfor ms this feat with his ‘mag ic cr eati ve"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52 Daniel Pinchbeck power,’” Capra wr ites. This “mag ic cr eati ve po wer” w as g iven the name “ma ya” in The Rig V eda, one of the most ancient Hindu scr iptur es. “The word ‘ma ya’—one of the most impor tant ter ms in Indian philosoph y—has changed its meaning o ver the centur ies. From the ‘might’ or ‘po wer’ of the divine actor and mag ician, it came to signify the psycholo gical state of any­ body under the spell of the mag ic pla y.” The space-time r eality w e per ceive from our limited per specti ve is lila, manifested thr ough ma ya, the mag ical po wer of the gods. The transcendent consciousness, be yond all conceptualization, outside of space-time , the sour ce of space and time , is Brahman. In the 1920s, Ar thur Eddington w as one of the fir st ph ysicists to pr opose that Relati vity Theor y suggested “the stuff of the w orld is mind stuff ,” and that this “mind stuff is not spr ead out in space and time; these ar e par t of the cyclic scheme ultimately der ived from it. ” Enlightenment or a wakening, in the Easter n traditions, is the indi vid­ ual’ s exper ience of reconnecting with this ultimate g round of being, the “suchness” ( Thathagatta ) that super sedes all dualisms. As the Buddhist sage Ashv aghosha put it tw o thousand y ear s ago: “Suchness is neither that which is existence , nor that which is nonexistence , nor that which is at once existence and nonexistence , nor that which is not at once existence and nonexistence .” Capra points out that such parado xical descr iptions sound identical to the ph ysicist’ s attempts to g rasp the slipper y essence of quantum objects, which ar e neither w ave nor par ticle , do not exist y et do not not exist. Capra found it inter esting to follo w the “spiral path” of Wester n sci­ ence’ s 2,500-y ear e volution, fr om the m ystical philosophies of ancient Gr eece , to a mater ialistic dualism and mechanistic w orldvie w that w as in shar p con­ trast to Easter n thought, and no w r etur ning to the integ rated per specti ve of the ancients: “This time , ho wever, it is not only based on intuition, b ut also on exper iments of great pr ecision and sophistication, and on a r igor ous and consistent mathematical for malism. ” The left-brain rationality of moder n science , based on objecti ve exper iment, had confir med the r ight-brain in­ tuitions of mysticism, based on subjecti ve exper ience . Mater ialist cr itics of Capra’ s per specti ve argue that quantum effects ar e limited to the submicr oscopic quantum le vel, and that “macr o objects, ” the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"2012 53 stuff we see in our w orld, contin ue to obe y the r ules of Ne wtonian ph ysics.

Macr o objects obe y the w ave equation for matter , disco vered b y the ph ysicist Erwin Schrödinger , their size r educing the pr obabilistic spr ead of quantum effects to an unnoticeab le amount. The Ne wtonian equations still maintain their effect on the macr o le vel, as a “special case” of the ne w r elati vistic physics, b ut the y ar e fuzzy appr oximations. The w orld w e live in is funda­ mentally a quantum one . In our daily li ves, do w e exper ience quantum effects such as nonlocal­ ity, action at a distance , and so on? Is that what the statistical e vidence for psychic phenomena—such as telepath y, remote vie wing, and pr eco gnition— indicates? Is it possib le that synchr onicity is also one of these effects, r eveal­ ing a deep-b uried inter relationship betw een time , space , and consciousness? Is consciousness itself a quantum phenomenon? In Sync hronicity: The Br idge Between Matter and Mind (1987), the ph ysi­ cist F. Da vid P eat mak es this argument. “Synchr onicities ar e the jok ers in natur e’s pack of car ds for the y refuse to pla y b y the r ules and offer a hint that, in our quest for cer tainty about the uni verse, we ha ve ignor ed some vital clues, ” he wr ites. A one-time collaborator of the ph ysicist Da vid Bohm, who de veloped the “holo graphic uni verse” theor y, Peat finds, in his study of synchr onicities, a link betw een ph ysics and psycholo gy. The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl J ung, in his 1951 essa y on the subject, defined synchr onicity as an “acausal or der ing pr inciple .” He noted that these episodes m ultiplied in his o wn life , and the li ves of his patients, dur­ ing per iods of intense psychic transfor mation. In J ung’ s autobio graph y, Memor ies, Dreams , Reflections , he r ecalls n umer ous such episodes—such as awakening fr om a star tling dr eam in which a b ullet passed thr ough his head, to lear n the next da y that one of his patients had committed suicide by shooting himself in the head dur ing the night. Elaborating on the con­ cept, he wr ote: Synchr onistic phenomena pr ove the sim ultaneous occur rence of meaningful equi valences in heter ogeneous, causally unr elated pr o­ cesses; in other w ords, the y pr ove that a content per ceived b y an"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"54 Daniel Pinchbeck obser ver can, at the same time , be r epr esented b y an outside e vent, without an y causal connection. From this it follo ws either that the psyche cannot be localized in time , or that space is r elati ve to the psyche . Studying these e vents, J ung found it pr obab le that mind and matter w ere, ultimately , “tw o differ ent aspects of one and the same thing. ” For P eat, synchr onicities g ive us glimpses into the deeper patter ns of natur e, indicating an organizing intelligence underlying the seeming chaos of daily e vents. The y ar e a par t of an or der of psychic r eality that w e rec­ ognize , intuiti vely, when the y occur to us, as pr ofound glimpses or sudden revelations of the natur e of mind: “Synchr onicities, epiphanies, peak, and mystical exper iences ar e all cases in which cr eati vity br eaks thr ough the bar riers of the self and allo ws a wareness to flood thr ough the whole do­ main of consciousness. It is the human mind operating, for a moment, in its tr ue or der and mo ving thr ough or der s of incr easing subtlety , reaching past the sour ce of mind and matter into cr eati vity itself .” Peat w onder ed if these episodes, instead of occasional r eaches into a differ ent or der of cognition, could become a contin uous flo w of synchr onic phenomena, exper ienced collecti vely. If that w as the case , synchr onicities would suggest “an intimation of the total transfor mation that is possib le for both the indi vidual and society .” In such a shift—which P eat equated with the “ending of time” descr ibed b y various spir itual traditions—differ ent “time or der s” w ould be exper ienced sim ultaneously; spontaneity , syn­ chr onicity , and cr eati vity w ould become the r ule , rather than the rar e ex­ ception. The old model of linear and mechanistic causality should g ive way to one mor e accurately based on “transfor mations and unfoldings. ” In Mys­ ticism and the New Physics , Talbot similarly concluded: “W e ma y suspect a slow and contin ual change of axis fr om causality to synchr onicity .” He quoted the Rig Veda: “W ithout effor t, one w orld mo ves into another .” My per sonal exploration of psychedelics and shamanism had attuned my sensiti vity to such episodes—and this seemed to lead to an exponential incr ease in their fr equency .

Accor ding to P eat: “It is as if the for mation of patter ns within the unconscious mind is accompanied b y physical patter ns in the outer w orld. In par ticular , as psychic patter ns ar e on the point of reaching consciousness, then synchr onicities r each their peak; mor eover, the y generally disappear as the indi vidual becomes consciously aware of a ne w alignment of forces within his or her o wn per sonality .... It is as if the inter nal r estr uctur ing pr oduces exter nal r esonance , or as if a burst of ‘mental energy’ is pr opagated outw ard onto the w orld. ” If consciousness someho w cocr eates such e vents, it is only thr ough the subjecti ve per specti ve of an indi vidual that the episodes can be obser ved and cor related. Lik e a quantum object that can be r egister ed as either w ave or par ticle , such temporally r esonant phenomena exist only thr ough our acti vity of conscious discr imination. It is our psyche that deter mines if an event r eveals a deeper or der of significance , or if it is ign ored as part of the quotidian flux. I found that attuning m yself to synchr onicities, lear ning to separate signal fr om noise , requir ed the development of a kind of intuiti ve skill, and r evealed an aesthetic dimension. Meaningful synchr onicities, ones that suggested some ne w patter n for ming, seemed to occur just be yond the thought or idea I w as cur rently holding, and w ere accompanied b y a psy­ chic sensation akin to a k ey tur ning in a lock.

The Catholic m ystic Pier re Teilhar d de Char din for esaw the de velop­ ment of a “ne w, integ rated mind” of global humanity , calling it the “noo­ spher e,” fr om the Gr eek w ord nous , meaning mind. Noting that our planet consists of various la yers—a mineral lithospher e, hydr ospher e, biospher e, and at mospher e consisting of tropospher e, stratospher e, and ionospher e— Char din theor ized the possib le existence of a mental en velope , a la yer of thought, encompassing the Ear th. The “hominization” of the Ear th had concluded the phase of physical e volution, dur ing which species m ultiplied and de veloped ne w po wers, leading to an entr opic br eakdo wn of the bio­ spher e.

The r omantic idea of a ‘sci­ ence of the imag ination’ seems to assume an e ver-mor e-empir ical aspect. ” But in our pr esent system, which Mar cuse dubbed “totalitar ian democ­ racy ,” the imag ination is denied its r ightful place . Or, to put it another w ay, the imag ination deter mining our social r eality is fixated on dominance , se­ cur ity, the death-dealing po wers of the militar y apparatus—on v arious pr o­ jections of our shado ws. Technical efficiency is v alue-neutral. It could be applied systemically , to liberate humanity and heal the w orld.

He used the same techniques to study the geometr y of the cr op for mations. He r ealized that the par ticular ratios he w as finding, again and again, in r inged cir cles and in the smaller satellite circles, fit the ser ies of diatonic ratios, the inter vals of the m usical scale . “A ratio in the diatonic scale is the step up in pitch fr om one note to the other ....

He w as f ascinated with “the r ose windo w topolo gies of the galacter ian beehi ves of the dimeth yltr yptamine flash, that nexus of cheap talk and for mal mathematics wher e wishes become hor ses and e verybody got to r ide .” Made illegal b y the U .S. government under the Contr olled Substances Act of 1970, DMT is a naturally occur ring chemical in the human body , found in the brain and spinal column, and pr o­ duced b y man y plants. The DMT molecule is similar to ser otonin and melatonin, tr yptamines in volv ed in the modulation of conscious states and rhythms of sleep and dr eam. Dr. Rick Strassman, the r esear cher who conducted a 1990 study on the effects of DMT thr ough the Uni versity of Ne w Mexico , adv anced the the­ sis that DMT could be the “spir it molecule ,” linking the ph ysical brain to as-of-y et unkno wn domains of the afterlife . A practicing Buddhist, Strass­ man made this pr oposition based on an intr iguing cor respondence be­ tween fetal de velopment and Buddhist scr iptur e. Accor ding to Buddhism, the soul r eincar nates se ven w eeks after death. The pineal gland—that sin­ gular organ in the brain that Descar tes had consider ed the seat of the soul—de velops in the embr yo for ty-nine da ys after conception. Strassman hypothesized that the pineal gland might act as a r ecei ver for the soul, and that DMT could function as the conducting medium. “The pineal gland of evolutionar ily older animals, such as lizar ds and amphibians, is also called the ‘thir d e ye,’ ” Strassman wr ote . “Just lik e the tw o seeing e yes, the thir d eye possesses a lens, cor nea, and r etina. ” In the e vent of a cataclysmic shock or at death, the pineal gland might r elease a flood of DMT into the brain, causing the “life r evie w” and the intense visionar y phenomena r epor ted in numer ous near-death exper iences.

The McK ennas ne ver found oo-koo-he . In f act, McK enna spent the r est of his life puzzling out exactly what the y did or didn’ t find in the Amazon. The br other s and their fr iends disco vered psilocybin instead, b ushels of plump Strophar ia cubensis that w eren’ t even on their or iginal men u. “W e ar e closing distance with the most pr ofound e vent a planetar y ecolo gy can en­ counter : the emergence of life fr om the dark chr ysalis of matter ,” McK enna jotted after his fir st m ushr oom m unch. Dra wn in b y the fungus, as if it w ere calling to them, the y pr oceeded to ingest the Strophar ia in v ast quantities over the next w eeks. The m ushr oom became the focus of their quest to combine the exper iential techniques of shamanism with the empir ical methods of science in or der to in vestigate the in visib le landscape , “the si­ multaneous coexistence of an alien dimension all ar ound us, ” which the y had fir st accessed thr ough DMT . Although McK enna w as only tw enty-four , he had been f ascinated with fr inge matter s since early adolescence . “My inter est in dr ugs, mag ic, and the mor e obscur e backw ater s of natural histor y and theolo gy ga ve me the inter est pr ofile of an eccentr ic Flor entine pr ince rather than a kid growing up in the hear tland of the United States in the late fifties. ” His brother , a fe w y ear s younger , shar ed his enthusiasms. McK enna had par tic­ ipated in 1960s campus politics at Berk eley, disco vering DMT “at the apex of the summer of love,” watched the radical counter cultur e collapse , tra v­ eled in the Far East, studying Sanskr it in Nepal and trafficking hash. As he had pr oposed it to one of his fello w tra veler s, DMT w as “some kind of outrage” that, pr operly under stood, could ha ve “tr emendous impor tance for the histor ical cr isis e verybody is in. ” The McK ennas dr eamed of becoming the psychonautical Wr ight Brother s of the Ne w Age , making char ter flights thr ough ne w r ealities, gar ner ing Nobel Pr izes for melding science and shamanism. “If the w orld beyond the doorw ay can be g iven consensual v alidation of the sor t ex­ tended to the electr on and the b lack hole—in other w ords, if the w orld be­ yond the doorw ay is found to be a necessar y par t of scientifically matur e"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"94 Daniel Pinchbeck thinking about the w orld—then our o wn cir cumscr ibed histor ical str uggle will be subject to whole ne w w orlds of possibility ,” the y wr ote in The In­ visib le Landscape (1975), their book on the adv entur e, a pr ecocious and in­ scrutab le b lend of scientific h ypothesis and psychedelic philosoph y. The y proposed that the existence of these r ealms r equir ed scr upulous—and courageous—exploration. It w as Dennis who pr ovided the impetus for what the McK ennas would later dub the “La Chor rera exper iment. ” When McK enna descr ibed the glossolalia he sometimes explor ed dur ing DMT tr ips, Dennis acti­ vated the same phenomenon while under the influence of the m ush­ rooms, emitting “a v ery machine-lik e, loud, dr y b uzz, ” thr eateningly insectile , which suggested to him the de velopment “of a shamanic po wer of some sor t.” Inspir ed b y this ne w ability , Dennis de veloped the thesis that this nonsensical sound-str eam—accessib le only dur ing tr yptamine trance—could be dir ected in some w ay that w ould r esult in “a molecular agg regate of hyper dimensional, super conducting matter that r ecei ves and sends messages transmitted b y thought. ” Despite the patent absur dity of this idea, the McK ennas took it ser iously , and cr eated the conditions in their rain for est shack for a test. The y had r ead accounts of Amazonian shamanism that r efer red to a “violet or deep b lue” mag ical liquid pr o­ duced from the body dur ing a yahuasca sessions, used for di vination and sor cer y—T erence belie ved he had once encounter ed this “psychofluid” dur ing a confused and org iastic night on a r ooftop in Katmandu, in volving LSD , datura, DMT , and UFOs. The seemingly impossib le goal of their La Chor rera exper iment w as to pr oduce and stabilize this extradimen­ sional liquid in the thr ee-dimensional w orld. “And end histor y. And go to the star s.” It didn’ t happen, it w ould seem—to the McK ennas’ chag rin, histor y refused to fold up its tent on Mar ch 4, 1971. The omega point did not ar­ rive. But something happened, or at least McK enna contin ued to belie ve something had. For the next w eeks, he found himself in telepathic rappor t with some alien other that do wnloaded ideas and infor mation into his mind, speaking to him lik e a teacher to a student. For nine da ys and nights he claims he did not sleep , as a deep co gniti ve reorganization took place . “The o verwhelming impr ession w as that something possib ly fr om outer"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"2012 95 space or fr om another dimension w as contacting us, ” he r ecalled. “It w as doing so thr ough the peculiar means of using e very thought in our heads to lead us into telepathically induced scenar ios of extra vagant imag inings, or deep theor etical under standings, or in-depth scannings of strange times, places, and w orlds. ” As McK enna r ecei ved these flo ws, Dennis r etreated fur ther and fur ther fr om consensual r eality , into a temporar y state of schiz­ ophr enia. While their fr iends w orried, McK enna r emained unconcer ned, cer tain that e verything w as pr oceeding accor ding to plan. “I used no psycho­ analytical jargon in thinking about it, b ut I noted a r eaction in m yself that included the idea that he might be unfolding into a m ythopoetic r eality , or as I thought of it then, ‘going bananas. ’ ” Dur ing the time in La Chor rera, McK enna noted an amassing of tiny episodes that seemed to abor t, momentar ily, the Ne wtonian constraints of space and time . Clouds for med into lenticular saucer s; m yster ious lights roved acr oss the fields; the r ushing w ater s on par t of the lak e suddenly ap­ pear ed to stop their flo w. When McK enna a woke one night and lit a can­ dle , he sa w “an intense , tr iple-la yered cor ona of light, ” shimmer ing out for four feet, r esemb ling the aura ar ound Chr ist’s body in a painting b y Matthias Grüne wald. In the after math of the adv entur e, although lacking the “consensual v alidation” he had hoped to estab lish, he contin ued to be­ lieve “under cer tain conditions the manipulati ve po wer of consciousness mo ves be yond the body and into the w orld. ” In par ticular non-or dinar y states, at par ticular times, the mind can deter mine “the outcome of the nor mally random, micr o-ph ysical e vents. ” The culmination, in McK enna’ s account, occur red on his last night in the village . Sitting b y the lak e in the g ray preda wn, he w atched clouds co­ alesce in the distance , for ming odd symmetr ies. One cloud seemed to s wirl inw ard “lik e a tor nado or w ater spout, ” tak e par ticular for m, and r ush to­ ward him. As it fle w dir ectly o verhead, McK enna look ed up . “It w as a saucer-shaped machine r otating slo wly , with unobtr usive, soft, b lue and or­ ange lights, ” he r ecalled. “It w as making the whee , whee , whee sound of science fiction flying saucer s.” To incr ease the effect of this “cosmic g iggle ,” McK enna r ealized the saucer w as identical to an inf amous photo graph of a UFO b y George Adamski, widely belie ved to be a hoax, “a r igged up end-cap of a Hoo ver"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"96 Daniel Pinchbeck vacuum cleaner .” The Myster y had un veiled itself to him as a cheesy ster eotype , alr eady deb unk ed. “By appear ing in a for m that casts doubt on itself , it achie ves a mor e complete co gniti ve dissonance than if its seeming alienness w ere completely con vincing, ” he theor ized. When McK enna r ead UFOlo gist J acques Vallee’ s Invisib le College several y ear s after the adv en­ tur e, he lear ned that “an absur d element is in variab ly a par t of the situation in which contact with an alien occur s.” Decades later , he felt he had wit­ nessed “a manifestation of a humor ous something’ s omniscient contr ol over the w orld of for m and matter ,” choosing to tak e the shape of a saucer in this instance , but capab le of taking an y for m. The alien “other” that contin ued to speak in McK enna’ s mind long af­ ter the e vent seemed to be the m ushr oom itself , which r epr esented itself as an ancient galactic intelligence inter ested in making a pr oducti ve symbiosis with moder n humanity . “It is f ar mor e lik ely that an alien intelligence would be bar ely r eco gnizab le to us than that it should overwhelm us with such similar ities as humanoid for m and an intimate kno wledge of our g ross industr ial capacity ,” he suggested, pr oposing, “the Strophar ia cubensis mush­ room is a memor y bank of galactic histor y.” As McK enna r elated, this fun­ gal consciousness told him that it distr ibuted itself thr ough the galaxies as spor es, tra veling on meteor ites, a waiting contact with the ner vous system of a higher animal capab le of conscious e volution. “The m ushr oom which y ou see is the par t of my body g iven to sex thr ills and sun bathing, ” the fungus infor med him. “My tr ue body is a fine netw ork of fiber s growing thr ough the soil. ” These m ycelial netw orks “ma y cover acr es and ha ve far mor e connections than the n umber in a human brain. ” Psilocybin and psilocyn w ere compounds pr oduced to open the psychoph ysical gate way to a galactic comm unity of mind. “You as an in­ dividual and humanity as a species ar e on the br ink of a for mation of a symbiotic r elationship with m y genetic mater ial that will e ventually car ry humanity and ear th into the galactic mainstr eam of the higher civilizations”—thus spak e the fungus. The other par t of the message the m ycelial intelligence con veyed to McK enna, as he for malized it o ver the next y ear s, w as a r evelator y ne w conception of the natur e of time . “Quite unexpectedly , what I no w pr o­ pose , based on those initial exper iences, is a r evision of the mathematical"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"2012 97 descr iption of time used in ph ysics, ” he wr ote in True Hallucinations . “Ac­ cor ding to this theor y, the old notion of time as pur e duration, visualized as a smooth plane or straight line , is to be r eplaced b y the idea that time is a v ery complex fractal phenomenon with man y ups and do wns of man y sizes o ver which the pr obabilistic uni verse of becoming m ust flo w lik e w a­ ter o ver a boulder-str ewn r iverbed. ” The ancient Chinese di vinator y sys­ tem of the I Ching, the T aoist “Book of Changes, ” and the bioenergetic matr ix of the DNA code seemed to be k eys to unlocking a deeper patter n or underlying str uctur e of temporality . Far mor e than a di vination system, the sixty-four hexag rams of the I Ching could be seen as a descr iption or map of the pr ocesses of evolution, development, deca y, and transfor mation as the y ar e exper ienced b y an y organism, species, indi vidual, or ci vilization. “The Lo gos taught me ho w to do something with the I Ching that perhaps no one kne w ho w to do befor e,” he wr ote . “Perhaps the Chinese kne w ho w to do it once and then lost it thousands of year s ago . It taught me a h yper-temporal w ay of see­ ing. ” It w as McK enna’ s inspiration to tak e the most august ar rangement of these hexag rams, the King W en sequence , and utilize mathematical postu­ lates to transfor m it into a g raph or w ave that r epr esented “the ing ression of novelty into histor y.” He dubbed the r esult “time wave zer o,” pr oposing that time w as not an un varying extension b ut “a medium of variab les in flux, ” wher e no tw o instants ar e alik e, and wher e ne w possibilities can en­ ter the frame at cer tain pr opitious moments. The time wave r evealed an “ocean of resonances, ” linking e very moment “thr ough a scheme of con­ nection that kne w nothing of randomness or causality .” The fractal or holo graphic vision of time that McK enna disco vered, or that his h yper spatial ally pr oposed to him, contained the inher ent idea that ther e exist differ ent “time or der s,” v arious for ms or str uctur es of temporal­ ity. “And these kinds of time come and go in cyclical pr ogression on man y levels; situations e volv e as matter r esponds to the conditioning of time and space .” Such an under standing helped to fr ee the indi vidual fr om the b ur­ den of time: “If you kno w what is contained in time fr om its beg inning to its end y ou ar e someho w no longer in time ,” he wr ote . “Ev en though y ou still ha ve a body and still eat and do what y ou do , you ha ve disco vered something that liberates y ou into a satisfying all-at-onceness. ”"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"98 Daniel Pinchbeck The time wave also implied an imminent r uptur e, an end to our linear time that w ould be a mo vement into a ne w temporal str uctur e. “Because we suggest a model of time whose mathematics dictate a b uilt-in spiral structur e, events k eep gather ing themselv es into tighter and tighter spirals that lead ine vitab ly to a final time .

The uni verse is seen as a ser ies of compar tmental­ ized eras or epochs whose la ws ar e quite differ ent fr om one another , with transitions fr om one epoch to another occur ring with unexpected sud­ denness. ” Back in Califor nia, after La Chor rera, McK enna found himself “in the grip of a cr eati ve mania mor e extr eme than an y I had thought possib le.” Prodded b y his ally and his o wn intuitions, McK enna fir st anchor ed his time wave in a pr esumed “no velty spik e” that occur red with the dr opping of the atom bomb on Hir oshima in 1945, locking in the “end of time” on No vember 17, 2012.

These tr ends include the rapid destr uction of the planetar y en vironment, the thr eat of nuclear and chemical holocaust un­ leashed b y ter rorists or nation-states, the exponential incr ease in infor ma­ tion, and the accelerated e volution of technolo gy. The de velopment of technolo gy does seem to be appr oaching a concr escence point—what some futur ist think ers call the “Singular ity.” The Stone Age lasted man y thou­ sands of year s, the Br onze Age lasted a fe w thousand y ear s, the Industr ial"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"102 Daniel Pinchbeck Age took thr ee hundr ed y ear s, the Chemical Age or Plastic Age began a lit­ tle mor e than a centur y ago , the Infor mation Age began thir ty y ear s ago , the Biotechnolo gy Age gear ed up in the last decade . By this calculus, it is concei vable that the Nanotechnolo gy Age could last all of eight min utes. At that point, human intelligence might ha ve complete contr ol of the planetar y en vironment, on a cellular and molecular le vel. This could lead to utopian cr eati vity or dystopian insanity—perhaps both w ould ar rive at the same moment. Most people w ould immediately dismiss the tangled complex of thoughts de veloped b y the McK ennas in the after math of the La Chor rera exper iment as a pr ojection of their o wn confused psyches, amplified b y the uncontr olled ingestion of large amounts of psychedelics. McK enna fr eely admitted this. “An y stor y of alien contact is going to be incr edib le enough by itself , but central to our stor y as w ell ar e the hallucino genic m ushr ooms with which w e were exper imenting, ” he wr ote . “The v ery fact that w e were involv ed with such plants w ould mak e an y stor y of alien contact seem highly dubious to an yone not sympathetic to the use of hallucino gens. ” On the other hand, it might be that McK enna’ s ne w model of time , with all of its r evelator y and apocalyptic dimensions, r epr esented some­ thing fished fr om the deep w ater s of the unconscious, an initial phase in the emergence of an ar chetypal complex, connecting the end-time eschatolo gy of the J udeo-Chr istian tradition to the m ytholo gical w orldvie w of the Clas­ sic Ma ya. Thr ough their effor ts to r eco ver “a lost kno wledge or a lost ar t, o r a lost consciousness” in the Amazon, utilizing the radical gnosis of psyche­ delic plants, the McK ennas could ha ve accessed, spontaneously , something that is, indeed, coming to pr esence within the collecti ve psyche . McK enna suspected this to be the case . “Nothing is unannounced, ” he noted. In his o wn life and the dr eams of man y of his patients, Carl J ung fr e­ quently exper ienced the phenomenon of a voice , seemingly fr om a sour ce outside the indi vidual, r evealing infor mation—similar to the telepathic in­ telligence that comm unicated with McK enna in the Amazon. The v oice “always utter s an author itati ve declaration or command, either of common sense or of profound philosophic impor t,” wr ote J ung, who consider ed the voice to be “a pr oduct of the mor e complete per sonality of which the dreamer’ s conscious self is a par t.” These dir ecti ves fr om the unconscious"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"2012 103 often manifest “an intelligence and pur posi veness super ior to the actual conscious insight. ” The do wnloads that McK enna r ecei ved fr om his mag ic mushr oom ally—about the natur e of time , and the potential symbiosis be­ tween humans and the galactic intelligence of the fung i—might f all into this categor y. The visions and dir ecti ves pr oduced thr ough hallucino gens can inten­ sify an apocalyptic per specti ve on r eality—I found a similar tendency in the after math of my own tr ips. Psychedelics ma y temporar ily splinter or e ven obliterate the ego , but soon the ego comes r oar ing back, seeking to cr eate a ne w cosmolo gical frame work in which it is ensconced at the center of a vast drama. The effor t to attain a ne w w orldvie w—metanoia—can collapse into paranoia. Although McK enna codified his ideas in the time wave, the idea lacks scientific v erification, since “the ing ression of novelty into his­ tor y” r equir es a subjecti ve value judgment and cannot be mathematically quantified. Without fur ther cor roboration, McK enna’ s time wave w ould seem to belong to the r ealm of the eccentr ic and discar dab le, lik e phlo gis­ ton, or orgone energy , or one of the glitter ing and ineff able objects de­ scribed in the f ables of Jorge Luis Borges—or lik e the concept of the Apocalypse itself .

Although not e veryone shar es the vision of an imminent “technolo gical singular ity,” the notion that our technolo gy is e volving in a teleolo gical w ay to ward some e ver- appr oaching y et e ver-postponed culmination is endemic to our thinking. It might be that our futur e lies in an entir ely differ ent dir ection. To see what this dir ection might be , it is instr ucti ve, fir st, to consider the essential natur e of technolo gy. The philosopher Mar tin Heidegger noted that the essence of technol­ ogy cannot be found in an y machine or ar tifact; the essence of technolo gy is the entir e “enframing” of reality that is our moder n or postmoder n w orld- view. “The thr eat to man does not come in the fir st instance fr om the po­ tentially lethal machines and apparatus of technolo gy,” Heidegger wr ote in his essa y “The Question Concer ning T echnolo gy.” “The actual thr eat has already afflicted man in his essence .” Technolo gy, he notes, is based on an order ing of reality that tur ns e verything—including people—into a “stand­ ing r eser ve,” a r esour ce to be utilized for rationalized ends.

It is a w orld of endless distractions, and “distractions fr om distraction, ” wher e indi viduals feel lik e voids that need to be filled. It is a w orld in which the pr esent is de valued, and our hopes and dr eams ar e pr ojected on an empty futur e. Heidegger notes that the or igin of the w ord “technolo gy” comes fr om the Gr eek w ord techne , and this w ord was applied not only to technolo gy, but to ar t, and ar tistic technique , as w ell. “Once ther e w as a time when the bring ing-for th of the tr ue into the beautiful w as also called techne , ” he wr ites. “Once that r evealing which br ings for th tr uth into the splendor of radiant appearance w as also called techne . ” He found this to be a n uminous cor respondence , and consider ed that, in ar t, the “sa ving po wer” capab le of confr onting the ab yss of the technolo gical enframing might be found. If art contains a sa ving po wer, it is not in the atomized ar tworks pr o­ duced b y indi vidual subjects, b ut in a deeper collecti ve vision that sees the world as a w ork of art, one that is alr eady , as Nisargadatta and McK enna suggest, perfect in its “satisfying all-at-onceness. ” Instead of envisioning an ultimately bor ing “technolo gical singular ity,” we might be better ser ved b y consider ing an e volution of technique , of skillful means, aimed at this world, as it is no w.

The J ung ian model g ives us a means of appr oaching the Judeo-Chr istian her itage that does not insult our co gniti ve faculties. From the J ung ian per specti ve, the Apocalypse , as w ell as the concept of a “Sec­ ond Coming of Chr ist,” ar e ar chetypes, r epr esenting aspects of the collec­ tive psyche . Jung’ s follo wer Edw ard Edinger defined an ar chetype as “a"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"110 Daniel Pinchbeck primor dial psychic patter n of the collecti ve unconscious that is at the same time a dynamic agency with intentionality .” The ar chetypes ho ver outside or offstage our human drama, a waiting their moment to “constellate” in the indi vidual and collecti ve psyche , catalyzing pr ocesses of transfor mation with f ar-r eaching consequences. Jung’ s theor y of the ar chetypes depended upon his under standing of the r eality of the psyche , the inter connection of mind and w orld. He de­ fended this position against an y mater ialist conception. “Not only does the psyche exist, b ut it is existence itself ,” Jung wr ote , finding this quite ob vi­ ous when one consider ed it: “It is an almost absur d pr ejudice to suppose that existence can only be ph ysical. ...W e might w ell sa y, on the contrar y, that physical existence is a mer e infer ence , since w e kno w of matter in so f ar as we per ceive psychic images mediated b y the senses. ” For J ung, m ytholo gical symbols and ar chetypes had definite existence as aspects of the psyche . “The fact is that cer tain ideas exist almost e verywher e and at all times and can e ven spontaneously cr eate themselv es quite independently of mig ration and tradi­ tion, ” he wr ote . Indi viduals do not in vent or generate the ar chetypes—often the y ar e o vertak en or possessed b y them, against their conscious desir es. As the r epositor y of myths, symbols, and suppr essed psychic contents, the unconscious exceeds the range of our conscious a wareness. Jung be­ lieved that consciousness “m ust al ways r emain the smaller cir cle within the greater cir cle of the unconscious, an island sur rounded b y the sea. ” Within the ocean of the unconscious, he per ceived “an endless and self- replenishing ab undance of living cr eatur es, a w ealth be yond our f athom­ ing. ” Along with the psychic de velopment of indi viduals, an ongoing process of evolution tak es place on the le vel of the collecti ve psyche . If the Apocalypse , as an ar chetype , is cur rently constellating in our w orld, w e have the option of bring ing this “dynamic agency” and pr imor dial patter n fully into our a wareness. By g iving it our conscious attention, w e can me­ diate the pr ocess, potentially a voiding its most catastr ophic effects. The book of Re velation is an a wful text to contemplate , lik e some­ thing coughed up fr om the depths of a bad acid tr ip—disjointed, doom- riddled, insufferab ly self-r ighteous, anno yingly pr igg ish.

It has alr eady star ted. It is manifesting itself in inter national r elations; in the br eakdo wn of the social str uctur es of Wester n ci vilization; in political, ethnic , and r elig ious groupings; as w ell as within the psyche of indi viduals. ” He consider ed the Apocalypse—with its str uctur e of separation, judgment, destr uction, and reinteg ration at a ne w le vel of wholeness—to be a pr ofound psycholo gical event, r epr esenting “the momentous e vent of the coming of the self into conscious r ealization. ” Jung’ s inter pretation of the J udeo-Chr istian tradition, which he eluci­ dated in his extraor dinar y essa y “Ans wer to J ob,” is based upon his split- level model of the psyche , compr ising the ego , the indi vidual consciousness, and the self , the “mor e complete per sonality” that includes unconscious and conscious elements. In our li ves, the desir es of the ego and the goals of the self are often at cr oss-pur poses. He sa w the Bib le as a document de­ scribing the e volution of the W ester n psyche , mo ving, in stumb ling stages and violent lur ches, to ward an ultimate r econciliation, an integ ration of ego and self . The W ester n god-image , Yahw eh, r epr esents “the ar chetype of the self ,” containing bene volent as w ell as male volent aspects. He is not only the “god of light” b ut also the “dark god” of punishment and r etribution. “Yahw eh is not split, b ut is an antimon y—a totality of inner opposites— and this is the indispensab le condition for his tr emendous dynamism, ” Jung realized. Not only a bene volent helper , the god-image also r epr esents the forces that oppose us, thr owing obstacles in our path, sur prising and humil­ iating us, inciting suffer ing to cr eate intensified self-consciousness. God, as a psychic f act, r eveals himself in our neur oses, our allerg ies, our f ailed lo ve affairs. “God enter s thr ough the w ound, ” he wr ote .

The v alue of per ception and the meaning of per sonal histor y w ere de­ graded and denig rated to institute a mass society focused on abstractions, impelled b y a “sense of the uni versal equality in all things. ” The loss of the ar t of stor ytelling cor responds to a change in our ex­ per ience of time . “The v alue of infor mation does not sur vive the moment in which it w as ne w. It li ves only at that moment; it has to sur render to it completely and explain itself to it without losing an y time ,” Benjamin wrote . “A stor y is differ ent. It does not expend itself . It pr eser ves and con­ centrates its str ength and is capab le of releasing it e ven after a long time .” He compar ed stor ies to those “seeds of grain which ha ve lain for centur ies in the chamber s of the p yramids shut up air-tight and ha ve retained their ger minati ve po wer to this da y.” Infor mation, on the other hand, is al ways accompanied b y explanation—“no e vent an y longer comes to us without being shot thr ough with explanation. In other w ords, b y no w almost noth­ ing that happens benefits stor ytelling; almost e verything benefits infor ma­ tion. ” It is almost our trag ic f ate as moder n people to long for meaning and recei ve only explanation. The earliest for m of the stor y is the f airy tale , “the fir st tutor of mankind, ” accor ding to Benjamin. “Whene ver good counsel w as at a pr e­ mium, the f airytale had it, and wher e the need w as g reatest, its aid w as near­ est. This need w as the need cr eated b y the m yth.

Franz Kafka wr ote: “Ther e is an infinite amount of hope—b ut not for us. ” T o be an “indiffer ent sk eptic” is to ha ve reached the end of a cer tain e volutionar y line—for a passionate sk eptic , or even an indiffer ent belie ver, ther e might still be hope . For an indiffer ent skeptic , all that r emains is the piling up of fact and statistic , to be sor ted into categor ies of explanation. Str ieber’ s memoir is a document of alienation, as well as aliens. Lik e the technolo gical “enframing” defined b y Mar tin Hei­ degger , the trauma inflicted upon him b y the visitor s is one that has alr eady afflicted him in his essence .

Ther e w as a subtle o vertone that seemed a little lik e cinnamon. ” He next finds himself in “a small operating theater .

This r ecollection leads him back to earlier ones, fr om childhood, fr om a per iod in 1968 when he had dr opped out of college and exper ienced “four to six w eeks” of missing time , associated “with a perfectly ter rible memor y of eating what I ha ve always thought w as a r otten pomeg ranate , which w as so bitter that it almost split m y head apar t.” He spits up this sub­ stance in this encounter , but in later abductions, the visitor s find w ays to mak e him s wallo w what the y ar e for cing on him. He is disturbed b y the “str uctural coher ence of the thing. Fir st I am fed and it comes back up .

It seems to me that it seeks the v ery depths of the soul; it seeks comm union. ” The title of his book w as g iven to him as a di­ recti ve.

So similar , yet differ­ ent, fr om the old f airy tales of fairies and gnomes, lurking on the ar chaic bor derlands of our r eality , the manifestation of the visitor s seems to be something bodied for th b y our thr ottled imag inati ve po wers. With their mood of guilt and accusation, with their infer nal and enigmatic and ex­ plicitly sexual punishments, with their peculiarly b ureaucratic and m urky quality , the abduction accounts suggest the par ticular f abulistic ter ritor y defined b y Franz Kafka, kno wn as the Kafkaesque . The closest literar y parallel to the abduction exper ience is found in Kafka’ s fables—in “The Metamor phosis, ” the stor y of the man who a wak­ ens as a b ug one mor ning; in the inescapab le accusation and existential guilt that per meates The T rial ; in the infer nal contraption that inscr ibes the condemned man’ s sentence o ver and o ver into his flesh in “The P enal Colon y”; in the jaunty , dispossessed figur es of the assistants and guar dians who m ultiply in his tales, and whom Benjamin connects with the gandhar­ vas from Indian m ytholo gy, “celestial cr eatur es, beings in an unfinished state .” The hor ror of the visitor s is matched b y the hor rific passi vity of moder n man, trapped in technolo gical encumbrances and b ureaucratic sys­ tems designed b y moder n man to k eep himself distracted, comfor tab le, and asleep . Str ieber undergoes a batter y of psycholo gical tests and lear ns he is “sane ,” but what does that mean? Lik e the accuser s in Kafka, his visitor s do not seek to r edeem or r efor m or change him in an y w ay—the y just ar e, lik e the somber r eality of a cr ime scene . Ransacking his mind and librar y for possib le explanations, Str ieber wonder s if “w e w ere creating drab , postindustr ial gods in place of the glo­ rious beings of the past. ” He conjectur es the intr uder s might r epr esent a mor e pr imiti ve species that had attained a for m of hive intelligence in a dif­ ferent manner fr om us. “What if intelligence w as not the culmination of evolution b ut something that could emerge fr om the e volutionar y matr ix at man y differ ent points, just as wings and cla ws and e yes do .” He consid­ ers that humanity might be a lar val for m, transm uting into something en­ tirely other after death, and the visitor s w ere the dead r etur ning in unkno wn for m. “Perhaps the dead had been ha ving their o wn technolo gical r evolu­ tion, and w ere lear ning to br eak thr ough the limits of their bour ne.” He"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"138 Daniel Pinchbeck reiterates theor ies of Carl J ung, Sigm und Freud, and P .

Civilization domesticated humanity , made us docile , “a household pet, ” although our in­ ner natur e contin ues to r ebel against this defor mation. “Man, full of empti­ ness and tor n apar t with homesickness for the deser t has had to cr eate fr om within himself an adv entur e, a tor tur e-chamber , an unsafe and hazar dous wilder ness—this fool, this pr isoner consumed with long ing and despair , be­ came the in ventor of ‘bad conscience .’” Moder n nihilism r evealed “man’ s sickness of man, of himself ,” but this “for cib le br each fr om his animal past” suggested, and pr essed to ward, ne w conditions of existence , “as though something w ere being announced thr ough him, w ere being pr epar ed, as though man w ere not an end b ut just a path, an episode , a br idge , a g reat promise .... ” Str ieber seems to r epr esent a par ticular type of moder n man who has recalled the need to seek for a soul—he notes that he w ork ed for fifteen year s at the Gur djieff Foundation—y et in whom that desir e, in itself , has"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"2012 139 someho w been b landified, r outinized, losing its sa vor.

Gob lins ar e cle ver: Our f airy tales tell us this. These entities— “unfinished, ” half-cr eated, or soulless—set age-old traps for humanity . The Gra ys or the visitor s ar e perhaps best under stood as an updated for m of gob lin or gnome . Accor ding to the Austr ian visionar y Rudolf Steiner , an extraor dinar y car tographer of the super sensib le w orlds, what gnomes and gob lins ar e made of is “entir ely sense , and it is a sense which is at the same time intellect. ” Lo wer cr eatur es such as these “ha ve no bon y sk eleton, no bon y suppor t; the gnomes bind e verything that exists b y way of gravity and fashion their bodies fr om this v olatile , in visib le for ce, bodies which ar e, mor eover, in constant danger of disinteg rating, of losing their substance ,” he taught, in Har mon y of the Creativ e W ord: The Human Being and the Ele­ mental, Animal, Plant and Miner al Kingdoms , a ser ies of lectur es g iven in Ger man y in 1923. Despite its inter stellar pr etensions, nothing about the visitor nar rati ve suggests an extrater restr ial or igin.

Working beneath the surf ace of the planet, in the Ear th’s min­ eral la yers, the gnomes tak e a similar r ole in our dr eam li ves. We are ter res­ trial beings, and ther efor e the gnomes ar e also at w ork “beneath the Ear th” of our psychic life , in our subconscious depths. “An yone who gets to the stage of exper iencing his dr eams in full consciousness on f alling asleep is well acquainted with the gnomes, ” Steiner noted. For somebody unpr e­ par ed, the exper ience w ould be an alar ming one: “at the moment of falling asleep , he w ould behold a whole host of gob lins coming to wards him .... The for m in which the y w ould appear w ould actually be r eflections, im­ ages of all the qualities in the indi vidual concer ned that w ork as for ces of destr uction.

One of the fe w moder n intellectuals to appr eciate Steiner’ s w ork, William Irwin Thompson character izes the “Steiner ian vision” as one that “looks at the human as so completely embedded in the animal, v egetal, and mineral e volution of the solar system that it becomes nonsense to separate a ficti ve ‘matter’ fr om mind, and a mer e thr ee dimensions fr om ten. ...A ll of the seemingly m ystical per ceptions of Steiner ha ve a biolo gical r elevance that fits a ne w kind of science , and a ne w kind of cultur e.” For Steiner , the uni verse is a har monic or chestration in which our minds ar e embedded, not as alienated organs, b ut as integ rated aspects of the whole .

In earlier phases of development, humanity had a deep affinity , an un­ conscious attunement, to the Ear th and the cosmos. This affinity is r e­ flected in our oldest stor ies and m ytholo gies, which r eveal cosmolo gical secr ets about the mo vements of the planets and the star s, as w ell as e volu­ tionar y pr ocesses in the histor y of the Ear th. Thompson consider s fairy tales and m yths to be “for ms of cultural storage for the natural histor y of life .” He pr oposes that the ancient saga telling of fairies defeating gob lins and banishing them beneath the Ear th is a r epr esentation, as m yth, of the original “pollution cr isis, ” mor e than 500 million y ear s ago , when cy anobac­ teria developed photosynthesis, cr eating an o xygen-r ich en vironment that was poisonous for other life for ms, radically transfor ming the biospher e to mak e it sustainab le for larger mammals. Translating fr om m yth to biolo gy, Thompson pr oposes that “the gob lins ar e the anaer obic bacter ia who li ve on and in our w astes and garbage , and the f airies, those air y cr eatur es of light, ar e the cy anobacter ia that w ere the fir st to in vent photosynthesis to feed on light to g ive off the o xygen that w ould become the ne w atmo­ spher e of an illuminated w orld. ” Anaer obic cells contain no n ucleus—lik e the Gra ys, whose bodies ar e undiffer entiated and without inter nal organs. In the saga of the visitor s, w e are witnessing a r etur n of the r epr essed, the m ythic w orld, surg ing into the postmoder n consciousness in a for m that strangely fits our fixation on technolo gy, our space f antasies and ge­ netic obsessions and dingy b ureaucracies, and our ter ror of the unkno wn.

Lik e quantum phenomena, the y do not exist or not exist, the y also do not exist and not exist, nor do the y both not exist and not not exist. Accor ding to Dzo gchen, a tradition of teachings and practices link ed to Tibetan Buddhism, ultimately ther e ar e no entities.

Ov ercoming dualism is essential to Dzo gchen, as Cho gyal Namkai Norb u wr ites in Dz ogchen: The Self- Perfected State: Duality is the r eal r oot of our suffer ing and of all our conflicts. All our concepts and beliefs, no matter ho w pr ofound the y ma y seem, are lik e nets which trap us in dualism. When w e disco ver our lim­ its w e have to tr y to o vercome them, untying our selv es fr om what­ ever type of relig ious, political, or social con viction ma y condition us. We ha ve to abandon such concepts as “enlightenment, ” “the natur e of the mind, ” and so on, until w e no longer neglect to in­ teg rate our kno wledge with our actual existence . Entities who manifest in other for ms of consciousness, such as the Gra ys, are, at the same time , separate fr om us and aspects of our psyche . We ar e the g round for their manifestation, and it is only b y attaining a nondual per specti ve that w e can under stand them.

Ov ercoming dualism, we can r eco gnize such beings as fractal shar ds or autonomous ar chetypes of our o wn psyche , as w ell as self-dir ected entities undergoing their o wn for ms of evolution. From such a nondualistic per specti ve, it mak es sense that some en­ counter s with the Gra ys ar e neutral or e ven positi ve. Betty Andr easson, a woman whose accounts of abduction w ere pub lished in the 1960s, de­ scribed a classic m ystical vision in which the Gra ys sho wed her a g iant golden phoenix that w as consumed b y a flame . In her descr iptions, and man y other s, the intr uder s reveal an ambi valent polar ity. Monster s pr o­ duced b y “the sleep of reason, ” the y ha ve a necessar y par t to pla y in the evolution of human consciousness—the pr ocess of psychic transm utation that alchemists called the “Gr eat W ork. ” Connected to our technolo gical de velopment, the Gra ys embody a malignant, super sensib le element lurking beneath our f ascination with mechanization, r evealing the ir rational basis of our constr icted rationality . The y also ha ve lessons to teach us. As the cr itic Le wis Mumfor d noted, “Our capacity to go be yond the machine r ests on our po wer to assimilate the machine . Until w e ha ve absorbed the lessons of objecti vity , imper son­ ality , neutrality , the lessons of the mechanical r ealm, w e cannot go fur ther in our de velopment to ward the mor e richly organic , the mor e pr ofoundly human. ” Lik e transhumanist zombies, the Gra ys embody the r educti ve per­ specti ve that sees e verything—matter , genes, human souls—as r esour ces to be used for pur poses of contr ol and domination. In this w ay, the visitor s serve as a w arning, as w ell as an innoculation against a nightmar ish f ate w e can r eco gnize , and r eject, in the time that r emains to us. As Pr osper o sa ys of Caliban in The T empest: “This thing of darkness I ackno wledge mine .” Accor ding to occult tradition, humanity has a r espon­ sibility to all of the elemental beings, those other for ms of consciousness that expr ess themselv es thr ough the natural w orld.

The obsession with finding the literal tr uth of the abduction phe­ nomenon ma y be , in itself , a r ed her ring, obscur ing the significance of the visitor s as psychic ar chetype . In one of Carlos Castaneda’ s books—which ar e of appr opr iately sketch y pr ovenance—Castaneda star ts to encounter his “doub le” in dr eams. At fir st, he assumes he is dr eaming the doub le.

Although our civilization cut itself off from spir itual kno wledge , w e ha ve the fr ee choice , as indi viduals, to seek it out, thr ough our o wn effor ts. Our empir ical and analytical mind-set pr ovides a fir m basis for explor ing super sensib le r ealms— if we reor ient our selv es to ward this differ ent goal. Steiner pr epar ed the philosophical g round for explor ing what he called “higher w orlds, ” car efully descr ibing the stages in acquir ing visionar y modes of per ception, as w ell as the danger s one might encounter along the w ay. One can lear n to attune one’ s self to the thr eshold of the sensib le, using the psyche lik e an antenna for subtler per ceptions and secr et r evelations. This effor t of esoter ic training r equir es a de velopment of the whole per son, in­ separab le fr om moral pr ogress. The use of psychedelics seemed a f aster b ut less conscientious means of attaining super sensib le insights, perhaps thr ough stim ulus of production of DMT in the pineal gland.

Wher e W ester n philosopher s such as Imman uel Kant belie ved ther e are “things in themselv es” separate fr om our per ceptions of them, Steiner noted that such a di vision can’ t be maintained. To separate thoughts fr om the “things in themselv es,” to alienate matter fr om mind, is alr eady , al ways and only , a thought—ther efor e it lacks intr insic v alidity .

Ther e can be no concei vable end point or limit to this w ork of reconciliation. It is an infinite task—an infinite pla y. “All real philosopher s ha ve been ar tists in the r ealm of concepts, ” he wr ote . I found Steiner’ s per specti ve to be shockingly liberating. He offer ed a non- dualistic r evisioning of reality . Steiner w as compelled to de velop his philosoph y out of his cir cum­ stances and unique g ifts. He w as bor n in Kralje vec, on the bor der betw een Hungar y and Cr oatia, in 1861, of Austr ian par ents. His f ather w ork ed for the Austr ian Souther n Rail way, and w as pr omoted to the job of station­ master at P ottschach in Lo wer Austr ia, wher e Steiner g rew up in modest circumstances. As a child, he w as a natural clair voyant—he could per ceive the beings, energ ies, and fluctuating patter ns of the super sensib le r ealms, as well as the spir its of the dead. In his memoir , he r ecalled ho w a r elati ve from a distant to wn appear ed to him one after noon, asking him to tak e car e of her wher e she w as going. He later lear ned she had died that da y. Such episodes ar e common in indigenous cultur es, wher e the shaman is kno wn to act as the inter cessor for the dead—in our moder n w orld, the y ar e seen as aber rations of mental illness. Since those ar ound him did not possess his clair voyant po wers and didn’ t under stand them, Steiner lear ned to be quiet about his g ifts. At the same time , he k ept tr ying to under stand the bar riers that pr evented people , not only fr om attaining super sensib le per ception, b ut e ven fr om being ab le to concei ve that an ything lik e it might exist.

Suffer­ ing from m ultiple scler osis, Glickman w alked with tw o canes, y et his hand­ icap did not k eep him fr om the center of the action. When I had inter vie wed him fr om Ne w Y ork, Glickman said that r esear cher s into cr op cir cles split into tw o camps—seek ers after mechanism, or seek ers after meaning. “I con­ sider m yself to be a seek er after meaning, ” he said. Because of his willing­ ness to go out on a limb , Glickman w as a f avorite target of skeptics and hoax ers. In his lectur e, which he deli vered in a tux edo—a pointedly g randilo­ quent gestur e, indicating his o wn sense of possessing elite kno wledge , against the ignorance of the masses—Glickman theor ized that the cr op cir­ cles w ere giving hints of an accelerated pr ocess of psychic transfor mation.

These cues w ere being g iven “so g racefully , so r espectfully and so gently” that y ou had to attune y our mind to them, or y ou w ould miss them. Glickman listed a n umber of “signs of the dimensional shift. ” These included the exper ience of time speeding up; an incr ease in synchr oni cities and coincidences; acceleration of premonitions and intuitions; and the oc­ casional occur rence of “little light e vents without a sour ce,” demonstrating “Ne wtonian mechanical impossibility” or violations of probability—he sho wed a slide , tak en b y a fr iend of his, of a her d of sheep for ming a per­ fect cir cle in a Scottish meado w, for no discer nib le r eason.

Glickman had less definiti ve comments about the Face and Ar ecibo Reply glyphs that had appear ed last summer . He thought the Face meant: “ ‘We are w atching y ou. We are seeing y ou. ’ The author s of the cr op cir cle phenomenon kno w us better than w e kno w our selv es.” The f act that the image w as ex ecuted in halftones, lik e an image fr om a ne wspaper , seemed significant. “Perhaps the y ar e sa ying that r eality only exists wher e pur e light and pur e dark merge to for m an image .” He had scathing comments about the or iginal Ar ecibo message sent b y SETI: “This is ho w w e repr esent our­ selv es to the star s?

The speak er was Dolor es Cannon, a h ypnotherapist fr om Arkansas, author of books on Nostradam us and on the extrater restr ial visitor s she called “The Custodi­ ans. ” Her books w ere inter national hits, especially popular in East Eur ope and Russia. A g randmotherly w oman in her sixties with white hair and glasses, Cannon spor ted a lime-g reen poly ester pantsuit. She asser ted that The Custodians w ere responsib le for all the for ma­ tions. “The y ha ve overseen the e volution of humanity since the planet cooled do wn enough to suppor t life ,” she said. Despite the ter rifying and r e­ pulsi ve dimensions of most abduction accounts, Cannon insisted that “ET” was a bene volent species who had attained a high le vel of spir itual and technolo gical perfection. “ET doesn’ t need to eat or sleep the w ay you and I do . The y ar e so m uch closer to The Light, ” Cannon said. “On their ships, the y ha ve special r ooms wher e the y go to bathe in The Light. That’ s all the y need, that’ s ho w spir itually adv anced the y ar e.” The Custodians w ere responsib le for the abductions, b ut these e vents had been misconstr ued b y man y people . Accor ding to Cannon, ET w as only inter ested in our w elfare. “Recently things ha ven’ t been going too well for the human race and ET is her e to help r eset our e volutionar y des­ tiny b y making genetic changes to ensur e the human race contin ues. ” The y were deeply concer ned that w e might cause an unintentional en vironmen­ tal catastr ophe .

She said"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"2012 165 that sometimes her sessions w ould be inter rupted b y ET , who w ould com­ municate with her dir ectly , speaking thr ough the bodies of her h ypnotized patients. Generally , I am not par ticularly sensiti ve to the types of “subtle ener­ gies” that psychics and “light w ork ers” pick up—the y tend to be too sub­ tle for me . However, as Cannon spok e, I became incr easingly a ware of something un usual in the r oom, lik e v ortices s wirling abo ve the heads of the audience . It seemed I could sense the entities she w as discussing, ho v­ ering in the air abo ve us. My intuition w as that those entities w ere probing and testing the lulled a wareness of the listener s, looking for entr y points, seeking to f asten on to their psyche , lik e mind-parasites. A strange thought occur red to me: Dolor es Cannon, as benign and matr only as she seemed in her lime-g reen ensemb le, w as allied, consciously or not, with the visitor s. As I listened to her , I felt I had enter ed the frame of a Da vid Cr onenberg mo vie , star ing at the w eird and impr obab le banal­ ity of poly ester-pantsuited male volence . I shi vered—as I had, months after my DPT tr ip, when I happened to encounter a quote fr om St. Paul: “F or we wr estle not against flesh and b lood, b ut against pr incipalities, against powers, against the r uler s of the darkness of this w orld, against spir itual wick edness in high places. ” In Tibetan Buddhism, mag ical practices in volv e cr eating “tulpas, ” kno wn in W ester n occultism as thought-for ms. Tulpas, thought-for ms, ar e imag inal entities that can be g iven energy and ar tificial life thr ough r ituals, meditations, and other w orkings. The poet W . B.

One of these , the “white jester ,” appar ently gained enough independent vitality to become visib le to a fe w of Yeats’ s fr iends, who w ere not a ware of what he w as doing. John Michell, chr onicler of Glastonb ury legends, consider ed old f ables in which the stone cir cles, b uilt ar ound 3000 BC , w ere constr ucted b y giants summoned up b y tribal w arlocks. “Those who ar e kno wledgeab le in the ar ts of raising spir its and cr eating thought- for ms ha ve wr itten that it is often easier to pr oduce phantoms than to dis­ solv e them.

With or without conscious intent, the psycholo gist acts as sor cer er, tur ning psychic energ ies into entities, thr ough his attention and ar ticulation. After one h ypnotherap y session, Whitle y Str ieber found a “vi vid im­ age” of one of the visitor s emerg ing in his mind, as perfectly r ender ed as a photo graph, sta ying ther e for se veral da ys. He w as ab le to mak e the entity mo ve in an y w ay he pleased, taking the oppor tunity to descr ibe it in g reat detail in his book, e ven ha ving a fr iend paint what he sa w. “W e don’ t kno w a thing about conjur ing and mag ic,” Str ieber wr ote . “We’ve dismissed it all, we who lo ve science too m uch. It could be that v ery real ph ysical entities can emerge out of the unconscious. ” Thr ough her w ork, Cannon—lik e the unwilling, unwitting Str ieber—w as helping the visitor s to gain solidity , bring ing them near er to our r ealm. Lik e a villain fr om the Har ry Potter se­ ries, she w as a sor cer er allied with underw orld for ces—at an y rate , that w as my exciting and unner ving conclusion. When it w as time for questions, I decided to test these m urky w ater s. “It is quite a stor y y ou tell, ” I said. “But ho w can y ou be so cer tain that these entities ar e bene volent? Ho w do y ou kno w the y ar en’ t just using y ou to pr omote their o wn agenda? And who do y ou think ar e the ‘unclean spir its lik e fr ogs’ descr ibed in the book of Re velation?” “Oh, no ,” Cannon r eplied in her affectless monotone . “ET is her e to help us and to look after us.

A dv ancing the w ork of Fr itjof Capra in The T ao of Ph ysics , the ph ysicist Amit Gos w ami pr oposes that the parado x es of quantum mechanics—nonlocality , action-at-a-distance , quantum uncer­ tainty , and so on—can only be r esolv ed thr ough the h ypothesis that con­ sciousness, not matter , is the fundamental r eality of the uni v e r s e . Instead of a dualistic split betw een mind and matter , or subject and object, Gos w ami puts for th a philosoph y that he calls “monistic idealism. ” Accor ding to this position, “the consciousness of the subject in a subject-object exper ience is the same consciousness that is the g r ound of all being. Ther efor e , con­ sciousness is uniti v e . Ther e is only one subject-consciousness, and w e ar e that consciousness, ” he wr ites in his 1993 book, The Self-Aw are Univ erse: How Consciousness Creates the Mater ial W orld. Gos w ami posits a “brain­ mind” system in which the ph ysical brain functions as a measur ing and r ecor ding de vice , follo wing the r ules of classical ph ysics, while a “quantum component of the brain-mind . . . is the v ehicle for conscious choice and for cr eati vity . ” It is the acti vity of consciousness, deter mining the “quantum collapse” of a w a v e-for m into a par ticle , that br ings the w orld into being. “Con­ sciousness is the agency that collapses the w a v e of a quantum object, which exists in potentia, making it an immanent par ticle in the w orld of manifes­ tation, ” Gos w ami wr ites. Our subjecti v e a w ar eness ar ises as a r esult of a “tangled hierar ch y” in the brain, a closed loop of self-r efer ence similar to the f amous “liar’ s parado x” (the man fr om Cr ete who insists, “All Cr etans"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"170 Daniel Pinchbeck are liar s”). Since quantum collapse can only occur thr ough a ph ysical brain, the ego is “an assumed identity that the fr ee-willing consciousness dons in the inter est of having a r efer ence point. ” Esoter ic disciplines and tech­ niques of meditation teach us to obser ve our subjecti vity , our ego-hood, with its contin uous babb le of thoughts and w orries, fr om an outside per­ specti ve, a “witness consciousness. ” By doing this, w e jump out of our in­ dividually conditioned vie wpoint, the self-r efer ential cir cuit, and tak e the transcendent per specti ve. The ego—which Gos wami calls the “Classical self ”—de velops habit­ ual patter ns of thought and beha vior in r esponse to conditioning. Ov er time , this conditioning cr eates a pr obabilistic bias in f avor of past patter ns of response . “Once a task has been lear ned, then for an y situation in volv­ ing it, the lik elihood that the cor responding memor y will tr igger a condi­ tioned r esponse appr oaches 100 per cent. ” In the same w ay that classical Ne wtonian ph ysics is no w r eco gnized as a subset of quantum ph ysics, “be­ havior ism is r eco vered as a special case of the mor e general quantum pic­ tur e.” But be yond our habitual patter ns of reaction, w e always pr eser ve the potential for spontaneous insight and unconditioned action. “When w e act in our conditioned modality , the ego , then our thoughts . . . seem algor ith­ mic , contin uous, and pr edictab le, which g ive them the appearance of ob­ jects of Ne wtonian vintage . But ther e is also cr eati ve thought, a discontin uous transition in thinking, a shift of meaning fr om conditioned to something new of value ,” wr ites Gos wami, pr oposing that “cr eati ve thought” is “the product of a quantum leap in thinking. ” Similarly , the ph ysicist F. Da vid P eat suggested that “synchr onicities, epiphanies, peak, and m ystical exper iences” reveal the mind “operating, for a moment, in its tr ue or der ...r eaching past the sour ce of mind and matter into cr eati vity itself .” The quantum aspect of consciousness also br eaks thr ough the cr ust of habit in the for m of intuition, which is not an ir rational pr ocess, b ut an arational one , often containing “a super ior analysis or insight or kno wledge which consciousness has not been ab le to pr oduce ,” wr ote Carl J ung. “You do not make an intuition. On the contrar y, it al ways comes to y ou; y ou hav e a hunch, and y ou only catch it if you ar e cle ver or quick enough. ” Rudolf Steiner noted, “Intuition is for thinking what obser vation is for the per­ cept.

Lik e quantum objects, thoughts seem to obe y the uncer tainty pr inci­ ple . Gos wami notes, “Y ou can ne ver sim ultaneously k eep track of both the content of a thought and wher e the thought is going, the dir ection of thought. ” He pr oposed that “mental substance”—thought—w as made of the same intang ible elements that b uild up the “macr o objects” of the ph ys­ ical w orld, b ut “mental substance is al ways subtle; it does not for m g ross conglomerates. ” Steiner also concei ved of thoughts as possessing a sub­ stance . Lacking the ter minolo gy of quantum ph ysics, he expr essed the idea in a m ystical frame work, per ceiving “thoughts as li ving, independent be­ ings. What w e grasp as a thought in the manifest w orld is lik e a shado w of a thought being that is acti ve in the land of spir its.” The “land of spir its” could be consider ed the transcendent domain of potentia. In The Self-Aw are Univ erse , Gos wami shifted fr om a mater ialist or ienta­ tion to one based upon the essentiality of “mind-stuff .” “I had v ainly been seeking a descr iption of consciousness within science; instead, what I and other s ha ve to look for is a descr iption of science within consciousness, ” he realized. “W e m ust de velop a science compatib le with consciousness, our primar y exper ience .” In a later w ork, The Physics of the Soul (2001), he puts for th a scientific h ypothesis, based on his under standing of the quantum natur e of consciousness, for the mechanisms of reincar nation, and the ex­ istence of the “subtle bodies” and chakra system descr ibed b y man y eso­ teric traditions. Neither cur rent Chr istian doctr ine nor the secular thought of the mod­ ern W est suppor ts the idea of reincar nation, which is a basic element in man y spir itual traditions, including Hinduism and Buddhism.

Ste venson has accompanied some of these childr en to meet the f amilies, cor roborating their specific memor ies. “The bir thmarks and bir th defects in these cases do not lend themselv es easily to explana­ tions other than r eincar nation, ” he notes. In the cases he has studied, the average per iod betw een death and r ebir th is fifteen months. Gos wami h ypothesizes that conditioned and habitual patter ns of thought, feeling, and action cr eate what he ter ms the “quantum monad, ” an agg regate of probabilistic patter ns, and it is this agg regate that r etur ns in life after life .

The distinct patter ns of conditioned thought, feeling, and action can also be consider ed the “subtle bodies” defined b y mysticism. The “mental body” r epr esents the indi vidual patter n of thought, and the “vital body” is the indi vidual patter n of energy and feeling. The indi vidual “quantum monad” de velops vital and mental memor ies of past contexts o ver its suc­ cessi ve lives. Beyond these habitual tendencies, w orn lik e g rooves in an old recor d, Gos wami posits a “supramental intellect” or “theme body ,” “the body of archetypal themes that shapes the mo vement of the ph ysical, men­ tal, and vital” bodies—what J ung called the self . Accor ding to Steiner , the theme body does not expr ess itself thr ough thoughts, b ut “acts thr ough deeds, pr ocesses, and e vents. ” The self “leads the soul thr ough its life des­ tiny and e vokes its capacities, tendencies, and talents. ” The subtle bodies and esoter ic organs defined b y differ ent esoter ic traditions—chi, prana, the nadis, Carlos Castaneda’ s “assemb lage point, ” the chakras, and so on—do not possess ph ysical substance , but ha ve a r eal exis­ tence as quantum phenomena, “the possibility w aves of an undulating in­ finite medium. ” Consciousness deter mines their manifestation. In Gos wami’ s scheme , consciousness is fundamental, hence these subtle energy str eams are integ ral aspects of our existence . He suspects the chakras ma y pr ovide “bluepr ints” thr ough which the vital body maps itself onto the ph ysical, repr esenting itself in the health and function of our organs.

Al­ though he consider ed Argüelles an ex emplar of an unhinged paranoid strain, Thompson w as also cr itical of the literalist notion that extrater res­ trials w ould appear on Ear th thr ough the scenar ios of von Dänik en, Do­ lores Cannon, or Close Encounters of the Thir d Kind —or e ven thr ough the reception of some transmission of radio w aves, as SETI imag ined. “The meeting w e are expecting in fr ont of us in linear time has alr eady occur red, is no w occur ring, and will contin ue to occur ,” Thompson pr o­ posed.

The seemingly simple 13-b y-20 matr ix of the Tzolkin functioned as the basis of Ma yan science and space- time tra vel, allo wing them to r ecei ve and transmit infor mation—as w ell as themselv es—betw een star systems.

It w as a thr illing pr esentiment, an atemporal appr ehension. For Argüelles, this is ho w the Ma ya are revealed to us—not as alien entities, b ut as a r esonant attunement with a higher fr equency of mind. “The Ma ya were retur ning, b ut not as w e might think of them, ” he wr ote . “Ultimately their being, lik e our s, transcends bodily for m. And pr ecisely for that r eason, their retur n can occur within us, thr ough us, no w.” For one s wooning, Pr oust­ ian moment, I came unstuck in time . Vast vistas pr esented themselv es—not a flood of per sonal memor ies, b ut of imper sonal cycles, m ystical ar rivals, cosmic un veilings. Argüelles’ s radical theor y about the Ma ya sub verts and o vertur ns our recei ved ideas about higher intelligence , ho w it w ould manifest and ho w it might function. Instead of a mechanistic race for f aster and f aster micr o­ processor s to cr eate some kind of artificial intelligence that can merge with or e ven r eplace us, the paradigm shift he pr oposes r etur ns us to the “zer o time” of meditation or psychedelic insight, to the m ystical under standing that the w orld and the Self are alr eady perfect, to a conscious deepening of technique rather than an y mechanistic extension of technolo gy. If the “Galactic Ma ya” h ypothesis has v alidity , it r eveals a r eality v astly differ ent from our cur rent per specti ve on it—unfurling, out of moder n linear thought, a m ultidimensional ar ray of infinite possibility . Argüelles points out that the name of the Ma ya is alr eady suggesti ve. As Fritjof Capra noted, “ma ya” is a central concept in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, wher e it signifies the “mag ic cr eati ve po wer” of the gods. “Ma ya” also came to mean the w orld of illusion, which is mistak en for r eality b y those who ar e under its spell. “Not sur prisingly , w e find that Ma ya is the name of the mother of the Buddha, ” Argüelles notes. “In Egyptian philos­ oph y w e find the ter m Ma yet, meaning uni versal w orld or der .” The ter m also appear s in Gr eek m ytholo gy wher e “the se ven Pleiades, daughter s of Atlas and Pleoine , number among them one called Maia, also kno wn as the brightest star of the constellation Pleiades. ” The Gr eek Maia is the mother of Her mes, or Mer cur y, trickster god of mag ic, thie very, and wr iting."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"2012 203 Could such cor respondences conceal a hint?

My explorations of the rapid-transpor t of DMT and other psychedelics seemed to suggest this—the y w ere lik e the sudden raisings­ and-shuttings of the b linds on opaque other r ealities. The solution of the puzzle w ould be hidden in the str uctur e of time— and the possibility that w e could attain a deeper r ealization of it. “Does it really exist, this destr oyer, Time?” the poet Rainer Mar ia Rilk e ask ed. Ac­ cor ding to moder n ph ysics, it doesn’ t exist in the w ay our or dinar y brains and ner vous systems pr ocess it. Ther e is, also , a transcendent domain, space- less and timeless, of which matter , space , time , and consciousness ar e inter­ related expr essions, and in which e verything w e per ceive as separate is intimately inter meshed. Argüelles pr oposes it is not a coincidence that the n umber of the “elect” in the book of Re velation, 144,000, is the same as the n umber of days in a “baktun. ” Time & the T echnosphere is filled with such n umer ical conjunctions and synchr onicities, some of them mor e tantalizing than oth­ ers. He also noted that a flaming, f alling to wer with people dr opping fr om it w as depicted on one of the traditional tar ot car ds, which some belie ve dra w their symbolism fr om the branching paths along the “T ree of Life” in the Qabalah. In the tar ot, “The T ower” r epr esents the collapse of a false belief system—a necessar y fir st step befor e attaining a ne w under standing. I had also noted that odd conjunction of symbolism in the w ake of 9-11— as if the crash of those skyscraper s w as a tar ot car d come to life .

As J a r ed Diamond wr ites in Guns , Ger ms , and Steel, the “decisi v e moment in the g r eatest collision of moder n histor y” occur r ed on No v ember 16, 1532, at the P e r uvian highland to wn of Cajamar ca, when Francisco Pizar r o and his “ragtag g r oup of 168 Span­ ish soldier s” captur ed the Incan emper or Atahuallpa and annihilated his ar m y of eighty thousand men.

Fr om the account of one of the victor ious Spaniar ds, ho w e v e r , it ap­ pear s that militar y pr o w ess had little to do with the Spanish victor y . “All of the other Indian soldier s whom Atahuallpa had br ought w e r e a mile fr om Cajamar ca r eady for battle , b ut not one made a mo v e , and dur ing all this"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"206 Daniel Pinchbeck not one Indian raised a w eapon against the Spaniar ds.” Once Atahuallpa had been dragged fr om his raised dais and captur ed, the conquistador s, fighting for the “Holy Catholic Faith, ” pr oceeded to b utcher their unr esist­ ing enemies for man y hour s, killing as man y as half of the Inca soldier s and routing the r est. In the after math of this slaughter , Pizar ro told Atahuallpa, “By r eason of our good mission, God, the Cr eator of Hea ven and Ear th and of all things in them, per mits this, in or der that y ou ma y kno w Him and come out fr om the bestial and diabolical life that y ou lead. It is for this reason that w e, being so fe w in n umber s, subjugate that v ast host. ” The Spaniar d demanded a “king’ s ransom” in gold for the r etur n of the emper or—“r evered b y the Incas as a sun god, ” ex ercising “absolute author­ ity o ver his subjects, ” Diamond notes. When the y recei ved their loot, the y executed Atahuallpa. Despite Diamond’ s analysis, the technolo gical adv antage in ar maments of the rapacious Spaniar ds does not seem sufficient to explain the r esults of this “decisi ve moment, ” which w as r epeated thr oughout the Ne w W orld, and in f ar-flung r egions of the globe , dur ing the centur ies of Eur opean imper ialism—in Bali, for instance , the r uling nobility chose to mar ch into the guns of their in vader s, rather than offer r esistance . Analyzing the paral­ lel collapse of the Aztecs, the philosopher J ean Gebser pr oposes, instead, that the Eur opeans r epr esented a ne w for m of consciousness, for which the myth-based kingdoms of Mesoamer ica had no defense . “The Spaniar ds’ super ior ity, which compelled the Mexicans to sur render almost without a struggle , resulted pr imar ily fr om their consciousness of indi viduality , not from their super ior w eaponr y,” Gebser wr ote . In his singularly forbidding tome , The Ev er-Present Or igin, the pr oduct of a lifetime’ s thought, Gebser pr esents a thesis of human de velopment that fits the quantum-based model of consciousness—unfolding fr om a tran­ scendent domain, e volving thr ough sudden shifts or cr eati ve leaps into ne w contexts—pr esented b y ph ysicists such as Amit Gos wami and F.

Accor ding to Gebser , w e ha ve passed thr ough a n umber of “consciousness structur es,” each one a pr ofoundly differ ent r ealization of time and space . “Man’ s coming to a wareness, ” he wr ites, “is inseparab ly bound to his con­ sciousness of space and time .” He defines four pr evious stages—the ar chaic , the mag ical, the m ythical, and the mental-rational—and argues that w e are"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"2012 207 cur rently on the v erge of transitioning into a ne w stage , which he calls in­ teg ral and aper specti val, character ized b y the r ealization of time fr eedom and ego fr eedom. A ne w for m of consciousness ar ises—as a sudden “m utation”—when the pr evious str uctur e enter s its ultimate cr isis, ha ving exhausted its possibilities. In a pr ocess perhaps similar to the appearance of language as a str uctur e in the brain, the successi ve mutations he descr ibes repr esent the spontaneous emergence of new capacities, which can only occur when the g round for them has been adequately pr epar ed. “Ev ery consciousness m utation is appar ently a sudden and acute manifestation of latent possibilities pr esent since or igin.” If one could imag ine a textual equi valent to the humming g ray mono­ lith that looms o ver the beg inning and end of histor y in the film 2001 , The Ever-Present Or igin would be it. Prototypically Ger man and difficult, Geb­ ser ranges o ver the entir e histor y of civilization, fr om pr ehistor ic ca ve painting to Cubism, fr om the chant-songs of abor iginals to the atonal m u­ sic of Schoenberg and Bar tók, fr om pr imiti ve spell-casting based on sym­ pathetic mag ic and “the v egetati ve inter twining of all li ving things” to nuclear ar maments. Or iginally pub lished in the 1950s, his book encom­ passes moder n de velopments in ph ysics, psycholo gy, biolo gy, the social sci­ ences, and other disciplines, tracking “the ir ruption of time” into a wareness, which he consider s the cr ucial element in our imminent shift into a ne w for m, or “intensity ,” of consciousness. Gebser w as an independent think er, only loosely connected to contemporar y schools of Eur opean philosoph y. Lik e Rudolf Steiner , he emplo yed the traditional tools of Wester n philos­ oph y to elaborate a ne w model of consciousness, one aligned with mysticism, y et deeply e volutionar y. The ar chaic str uctur e repr esents the pr imor dial beg innings of human­ ity. The ar chaic mind is outside of time , lacking an y concept of progress or evolution, undiffer entiated fr om what Gebser calls “or igin,” a pr espatial and pr etemporal unity—pur e pr esence or “suchness. ” In the ar chaic w orld, ther e is no a wareness of indi viduality , only a tr ibal or g roup consciousness. Among Abor iginals in Australia—not identical to the ar chaic mind-set b ut one of the closest sur viving links—the pur pose of ritual is to maintain the creation in its or iginal har mon y, preser ving the w orld’ s vibration or tone . “For the Abor igines, ther e is no f all; paradise is the ear th in its pr istine"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"208 Daniel Pinchbeck beauty ,” wr ites Rober t La wlor in Voices of the First Da y: Aw akening in the Abor iginal Dreamtime , an extraor dinar y effor t to r ecaptur e the Abor iginal worldvie w and w ay of life . “Ther e is no par t of this existence that needs to be transcended, r epr essed, or gone be yond. ” Abor iginal or ar chaic time is per petual pr esence and celebration, in which e very da y is the “fir st da y.” The songs of Pygmies and Abor iginals ar e “manifestations without beg in­ ning and end, a chance intr usion of the v oice and a chance ending: a sleep that has, as it w ere, become sound, ” wr ites Gebser . The mag ical for m of consciousness, for Gebser , is “pr e-rational, ” char­ acter ized b y instantaneity , egolessness, and “unitar y merg ing, ” similar to sleep or trance . Ther e is no distinct separation betw een psyche and w orld for “mag ic man, ” hence he feels a pr ofound inher ence and affinity betw een himself and the cosmos. “It is a w orld of pur e b ut meaningful accident; a world in which all things and per sons ar e inter related, b ut the not-y et­ center ed Ego is disper sed o ver the w orld of phenomena, ” Gebser wr ites. The mag ic str uctur e “lies befor e time , befor e our consciousness of time . Ho w f ar back w e ma y wish to place this mag ic time into pr ehistor y is not only a question of one’ s pr edilection, b ut, on account of the time-less character of the mag ical, is essentially an illusion. ” This is an impor tant aspect of Gebser’ s thesis. The v arious str uctur es he descr ibes, “unfolding fr om or igin,” ar e expr essions or possibilities of the transcendent consciousness, outside of space and time . Each of us contains all of the past for ms within us, just as w e preser ve the older la yers of cor tical development within the ph ysical brain. A r egression to the deindi viduated and pr erational mag ic str uctur e r emains a pr esent danger in our moder n world—it is appar ent in mass phenomena such as v arious for ms of fanati­ cism and fundamentalism, in the trance-inducing po wers of slogans and the media, as w ell as the beha vior of crowds dur ing spor ts spectacles and r iots. “The exper ience of wher e the mag ic str uctur e beg ins and ho w it w orks must be made b y every per son indi vidually , and the per il lies “behind” the exper ience and thr eatens an yone unpr epar ed with the loss of self ,” Gebser wr ites.

This fear that man is compelled to r ule the outside w orld—so as not to be r uled b y it—is symptomatic of our times. Every indi vidual who f ails to r ealize that he m ust r ule himself falls victim to that dr ive.” The o versaturation of the mag ic w orld b y mana —vital energy , super­ natural potential—e ventually led to an “emergent a wareness” of the soul, that daimonic and ambiguous inner r ealm, betw een body and spir it, de­ scribed b y Patrick Har pur . The m yths expr essed and ar ticulated b y the mythic consciousness “r eveals the soul and, at the same time , an in visib le and extended r egion of natur e, the cosmos, ” Gebser wr ites. The m ythic consciousness or iented itself around polar ities—of dream and a wakening, life and death, gods and men, Hea ven and Ear th. As r epr esented in the T ai Chi symbol, one pole does not negate its antipode , but r eflects and includes it. “When w e speak of ‘time’ w e are also speaking of ‘soul, ’ ” wr ites Gebser . The emergent a wareness of the soul elicited an a wareness of time , not in the moder n sense of a linear pr ogression, b ut as a cyclical pr ocess of change , becoming, and r etur n, similar to the rh ythms of dream and a wakening. Histor y, in our sense of the ter m, did not exist until the moder n era; “the Egyptians of old kne w only of annals or chr onicles, not of histor icity .” Mythic man studied the star s swirling o verhead, innately a ware that their vast and intr icate whirlings w ere precisely aligned to the patter ns of human development on the Ear th—an under standing summed up in the Her metic dictum, “As abo ve, so belo w.” Egyptian cosmolo gy focused on the “Pr ecession of the Equino xes,” a slow backw ard mo vement of the star s in r elation to the Sun’ s rising on the equino x, which appear s in a differ ent constellation e very tw enty-tw o hund red year s or so , requir ing r oughly tw enty-six thousand y ear s to complete an entir e round.

By the time w e reach the celebrated r oom of Rembrandt por traits, in our time-w alk thr ough the m useum halls, the paintings ha ve become mir rors reflecting our moder n consciousness back at us—our mer cantile cynicism and self-questioning ir ony, emerg ing out of darkness and shado w to confr ont our inner v oid. This static spatial concep­ tion began to br eak up in the late nineteenth centur y, when Impr essionism and P ost-Impr essionism w ere follo wed b y Cubism and Futur ism, in which artists attempted to r epr esent time as w ell as space on a flat surf ace . For Geb­ ser, these moder n mo vements symbolized the tr oub ling “ir ruption of time” into consciousness, b ut not y et its integ ration in a ne w for m of awareness. Our changed r ealization of space and self was accompanied b y a trans­ for mation in our r elationship to time . Rejecting the v ast cycles and “eter­ nal r etur n” of the m ytholo gical w orldvie w, the moder n mind sa w “absolute time” as an un varying linear extension, equi valent to space , as measurab le as matter .

Time , Gebser pr oposes, is not e ven a “four th-dimension” to be added to the thr ee-dimensional spatial w orld, as Einstein for mulated it. “True time does not cur ve space; it is open and opens space thr ough its capacity of render ing it transpar ent, and ther eby super sedes nihilistic ‘emp­ tiness, ’ re-attaining openness in an intensified consciousness str uctur e.” The four th-dimension, for Gebser , is not time , but “time fr eedom. ” Our histor y since the Renaissance r epr esents, for Gebser , the early foreshado wings and inchoate manifestations of an o verwhelming cr isis of time , which has no w r eached its acute and final stage . We can see this most clearly , perhaps, in the e volution of technolo gy. Noting that J ames W atts’ s invention of the steam eng ine in 1782 pr eceded the French Re volution b y only se ven y ear s, Gebser cor relates these tw o e vents in the moder n psyche . The French Re volution r epr esented, in the social spher e, the same for ces and underlying conditions that impelled mechanization. “What led to the invention of the machine?

The French Re volution w as the fir st r evolt and mass asser tion of “The Left, ” smashing the old ar istocratic r egime with its demands for “liber te, egalite , frater nite .” The left-r ight di vision r epr esents, for Gebser , one of the original dualisms underlying ci vilization. “Since ancient times, the left side has stood for the side of the unconscious or the unkno wn; the r ight side , by contrast, has r epr esented the side of consciousness and w akefulness. ” Thr ough the late tw entieth centur y, the mo vements of the Left limited themselv es to a mater ialist under standing of reality—ex emplified b y Marxism— demanding social justice and economic equity b ut not the r estoration of intuition and the r eco gnition of the hidden, qualitati ve dimensions of being suppr essed b y the mental-rational consciousness, nar rowly focused on the quantifiab le.

Our ci vilization is based on f alse time , and ar tificial time has r un out for humanity .” I ask ed him to elucidate the pr inciples of his calendar that made it an instr ument of “per petual or der and har mon y.” He explained that it w as based on thir teen “moon-ths” of twenty-eight da ys each, follo wing lunar"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"224 Daniel Pinchbeck cycles, with one “da y out of time ,” for celebration and forg iveness of debts, at the end of each calendar y ear . “The moon cir cles the ear th thir teen times a year , not tw elv e,” he said. “For the Ma ya, thir teen w as the lucky n umber of natural cycles and synchr onization. The v ery act of replacing the or der of twelv e with the or der of thir teen w ould be a pr ofound one .” In Time & the T echnosphere , he argued that the super stition o ver the number thir teen had deep r oots in W ester n cultur e. “Could it be that the whole of civilized histor y is based on the fear of the n umber thir teen— epitomized in the super stition about Frida y the 13th —and that, ther efor e, dealing with the tr ue natur e of time has been a voided alto gether?” I g rew up in an apar tment b uilding lacking a thir teenth floor , lik e most b uildings in Manhattan, and when I w as a child, I al ways found it eer ie that our cultur e—while pr iding itself on its rational sk epticism—clung to this antique phobia. Argüelles pr oposed that thir teen is actually the lucky n umber of natural and feminine cycles (accor ding to Argüelles, the female menstr ual cycle should be tw enty-eight da ys), synchr onicities, and har mon y—for that reason, it w as suppr essed b y the male patr iarchal mind-set, incr easingly committed to mechanized rationality . Along with its thir teen r egular “moon-ths, ” Argüelles’ s calendar also has a deeper le vel, follo wing the cycle of 260 da ys, or “kin, ” of the Tzolkin, the 13-b y-20 matr ix with its “binar y cr osso ver patter n” that he consider s the essential instr ument of the Ma ya’s sacr ed science . He elaborated a com­ plex system, called the “Dr eamspell, ” to help people enter into the Ma ya’s fractal, fugue-lik e chr ono vision—to exper ience time as a tonal loom of synchr onicity and r esonance , on scales rang ing fr om the per sonal to the cosmic . As he wr ote in The Ma yan Factor: “For the Ma ya what w e call time is a function of the pr inciple of har monic r esonance . Thus, da ys ar e actu­ ally tones, called kin, r epr esented b y cor responding n umber s; sequences of days (kin) cr eate har monic cycles . . . and sequences of har monic cycles t aken as larger agg regates descr ibe the har monic fr equencies or calibrations of a larger organic or der , sa y, the har monic patter n of planet Ear th in r elation to the Sun and the galaxy be yond. ” The cycles of thir teen da ys, tw enty days, 260 da ys ar e fractals r eflecting larger cycles and energetic patter ns.

As he wr ote in Time & the T ech­ nosphere , in his un usual science-fictional patois: “Pr ophecy is the r elease of infor mation accor ding to the psi bank timing pr ogram and in r elation to deg rees or le vels of consciousness positioned at differ ent points in time . The points in time ar e human channels. ” He belie ves he is one of those “points in time ,” a r ecei ver attuned to the shamanic spectr um, beaming fr e­ quencies fr om the f arthest edge of the cultural imag ination. Meeting him, it w as difficult to r econcile the str idency of some of his pr onouncements with his gentle , soft-spok en, and r easonab le demeanor . Noting the difficulties in separating “signal” fr om “noise” in occult cosmolo gies, W illiam Irwin Thompson thought that the ne w m ytholo gies enter ing our postmoder n w orld via the collecti ve unconscious w ere neces­ sarily distor ted b y the per sonality of the medium picking up the ne w pat­ tern. “If a per son is open to a ne w w orld vie w, it can often mean that he is not fir mly r ooted in the r eality of the old w orld vie w; as a lunatic or alien­ ated ar tist, his o wn neur otic traits can become magnified as the y tr emb le with the ne w energy pour ing in fr om the uni versal sour ce.” Thompson proposed that the r elationship betw een infor mation and noise w as a “r ich and complex one; it is at once symbiotic , lik e life and death, and r elati vis­ tic, lik e time and space .” In his ambition and willingness to operate pr ophet­ ically , Argüelles had wr enched himself open to an extraor dinar y amount of infor mation, as w ell as noise—and seeming nonsense .

Ho wever, the tonal, cyclical, synchr onic infrastr uctur e of the Ma yan calendar—a ne w v ersion of it satisfying both the aesthetic and technical r equir ements of contempo­ rary humanity—might pr ovide the basis for bootstrapping us into a ne w consciousness of temporality . Such an instr ument w ould r edefine our r ela­ tionship to time . Instead of trapping us in a limited and linear histor y, a new calendar could integ rate our ear thly li ves within a pr operly galactic frame of refer ence . Lik e T eilhar d de Char din, Argüelles theor izes that the noospher e, “a function of the whole system of the Ear th,” alr eady exists, in nascent for m. Wher e the biospher e is the r egion “for transfor mation of cosmic energ ies, ” the noospher e w ould be the r ealm “for the r eflection of cosmic conscious­ ness and its mental pr ograms. ” The functioning of the noospher e will be transfor med and acti vated when humanity attunes with it thr ough a global act of reflection. He suspects that the noospher e has a ph ysical location, woven betw een the tw o Van Allen radiation belts in the Ear th’s upper at­ mospher e, girdling the Ear th lik e a g iant or obor us, the snak e eating its o wn tail, a symbol in man y sacr ed traditions.

Such drastic manipulations of little-under stood forces ar e symptomatic of the cur rent mind-set. The institution of a ne w calendar—a ne w timing fr equency—could be the self-r eflecti ve act, integ rated, organically , with our collecti ve raising of consciousness, initiating a ne w r elation to time , space , and being, aligning us with the noospher e. Such a ne w co venant, ho wever, could not be insti­ tuted b y one visionar y—it w ould r equir e a collecti ve realization and a global meeting of minds, synthesizing astr onom y, ph ysics, and the spir itual traditions of the w orld. Lik e Dean Radin, Argüelles suspects w e are cur­ rently in the same situation r egar ding psychic phenomena that w e were in the 1750s in r elation to electr icity . Befor e that time , people had been a ware of lightning and static shocks, b ut the y did not kno w that this po wer could be dra wn do wn and made into a transfor mati ve for ce. Similarly , man y of us are incr easingly a ware of synchr onicity , telepath y, psychoph ysical inter rela­ tion, and so on, b ut w e ha ve not y et r eached the intensified le vel of con­ sciousness that w ould allo w us to emplo y such psychic energ ies as a sustaining and transfigur ing po wer, a ne w field of action, for our w orld. It might be that initiating the noospher e thr ough this act of collaborati ve concor dance would induce an exponential e volution of the psyche—thus explaining the telescoped last p yramid-step of 260 da ys, defined b y the Ma yan f actor . Argüelles, J enkins, and Calleman ar e the thr ee main pr oponents of the concept that the Ma yan calendar is, as Calleman puts it, “fundamentally a time-schedule for the e volution of consciousness. ” While the y ag ree on the big pictur e, the y bick er o ver the finer points of how and when exactly this phase-shift will tak e place . Although Calleman belie ves w e are mo ving to­ ward nonduality , he insists that the Ma yan calendar is based on “spir itual” cycles that ha ve no r elationship whatsoe ver to the ph ysical mo vement of the star s and planets. “If toda y w e are to embrace a w orldvie w in which consciousness is mor e impor tant than matter , w e too need to base our timek eeping on the nonph ysical, in visib le r eality rather than on the ph ysi­ cal, ” he wr ites. Imposing an unneeded dualism betw een matter and spir it, Calleman dismisses J ohn Major J enkins’ s thesis r elating the 2012 transition to an astr onomical alignment, despite J enkins’ s year s of copious and car eful resear ch on the subject.

The teacher said that in their cer emonial w ork, the y ask ed the Mother to r etur n, “to sit back do wn in her cr eation. ” She told us of messages she had r ecei ved in trances—such as one wher e the Mother told her , “The mind will call this time chaos, when all possibilities seem open, when everything seems on the point of collapse . But I call it ‘or iginal g round. ’ ” She said that she consider ed the shamanic plants to be “je wels in the Mother’ s bask et. The Mother w ants us to hold these je wels for no w. Later , she will tell us what she w ants us to do with them. ” She for esaw a futur e point when the shamanic medicines w ould disappear fr om the Ear th— when w e no longer had need of them.

The w ord also came to mean “a cheap imita­ tion, ” or , as adjecti ve, “imitation, spur ious. ” A dictionar y definition of the word “ma ya” is “the illusor y appearance of the sensib le w orld. ” The w orld of ma ya could be consider ed a “pinchbeck” r eality . The Ma ya, the sear ch for alchemical gold, the illusor y matr ix of space and time—all of these ap­ pear ed to be punned, b y some dazzling and subtle mind, within m y eccen­ tric monik er.

When she r ealized the impossibility of refor ming the dysfunc­ tional institutions that acted as a “dumping g round” for the cour ts and legal systems fr om within the system, she began to listen to an “inner v oice” that told her , “Y ou ar e thr owing y our stone into the wr ong pond.

Kundalini, the “ser pent po wer,” is an occult energy that r esides in the body , accor ding to y ogic texts.

She descr ibed pr ofound energetic shifts, in which a white light seemed to pour thr ough her and she hear d a loud b uzzing in her ear s, leading to visions of other times, places, and worlds, as w ell as v oices con veying specific messages. After one such ini­ tiator y episode in the early 1980s that ended with a v oice pr onouncing, “Once y our hands ar e on the plo w, you can ne ver look back”—man y y ear s befor e she star ted her study of shamanic substances—she and her husband found that “the br icks on the exter ior w all of our garage had completely buckled out fr om the w all. . . .

Dur ing a tr ip to Rome , she found her self blacking out while standing be­ fore a sink in her hotel r oom. She enter ed a vision wher e “I w as in a dark passage and a man w as speaking to me in a language not fr om this planet. I seemed to kno w and under stand him quite w ell. I spok e to him in an author itati ve manner demanding that he lea ve—get out of me .” Retur n­ ing to nor mal a wareness, she felt she had r ecei ved an in vitation to act as medium for this entity , “b ut some par t of me had v ery emphatically de­ clined. I w as clear that if I w as going to be ask ed to do such w ork, I w anted to be conscious sim ultaneously . But what did that mean?” The culmination of an eight-y ear pr ocess of often agonizing bodily r e­ structur ing began with her fir st exper iences of samadhi, a m ystical immer­ sion in pur e radiance that temporar ily ob literates nor mal consciousness. As a ph ysical manifestation, she de veloped a per manently s wollen “Buddha belly .” While lying in bed one night, “something about the size of a small man’ s fist for med under m y skin at m y pelvic r egion and with a twisting mo vement, extended itself up to the middle of my abdomen, stopping at my hear t region. ” As her husband and a close fr iend w atched o ver her with much alar m, the pr ocess contin ued for hour s. “When I a woke the next mor ning, m y belly w as extended to the point that I look ed about fi ve months pr egnant. ” Gi ven a r eading b y a psychic fr iend, she w as told she w as “merg ing r ealities.

On one of the last nights of the r etreat, w e lay to­ gether on pillo ws in the lodge , holding each other .

Heath’ s w ork b uilds upon the w ork of John Michell, who sho wed, in his A New View Ov er Atlantis , that Stonehenge included complex se venfold geometr y in its la yout, and a near-perfect r epr esentation of the “squar ed circle.” The pr oblem of squar ing the cir cle—in which the per imeter of a squar e equals the cir cumfer ence of a cir cle—is an ancient one with impor­ tant symbolic o vertones. The squar e repr esents “Ear th” and matter while the cir cle symbolizes “Hea ven” and di vinity; integ rating these for ms f asci­ nated the ancient mind. This difficult pr oblem cannot be solv ed—as a Ger man mathematician pr oved in the late nineteenth centur y—thr ough or dinar y cal­ culations or geometr ical means in volving a compass and straightedge . Michell found that the pr opor tions of the squar ed cir cle implied by relationships within Stonehenge w as identical to one produced, n uminously enough, b y bring ing the Moon do wn to touch the Ear th, then dra wing a squar e that tangents the Ear th, and a cir cle with its cir cumfer ence defined b y the Moon’ s center point.

In other w ords, if the mon ument w as not placed at its pr ecise spot—“located at a latitude which is one se venth of the circumfer ence of the Ear th r efer red to the equator”—the alignments w ould not ha ve work ed. The “station stone” r ectangle w ould ha ve been a cr ook ed parallelo gram. With his eng ineer’ s mind, Heath glides thr ough abstr use ar­ eas of meter s and metr ics that elude simple par sing. What appear s to ha ve been deliberately indicated, in n umer ous w ays, in the sighting and inner geometr ics and alignments of Stonehenge , is the difficult pr oblem of rec­ onciling the 365.242 da ys of the solar y ear with the Moon’ s orbital cycles to mak e an accurate calendar . José Argüelles argues that his “13 moon calendar” is perfectly har monic because the Moon cir cles the Ear th thir teen times a y ear—b ut this is not precisely the case . In actual f act, ther e ar e se veral differ ent lunar cycles—the per iod fr om full Moon to full Moon, called a “lunation, ” is 29.6 da ys, oc­ cur ring 12.368 times in each solar y ear , while the amount of time it tak es the Moon to pass a fix ed star—the “sider eal lunar month”—is 27.322 da ys. Although Argüelles mak es a case for a tw enty-eight-da y “apsidal” cycle , “tak en fr om the measur e of when the Moon’ s axis is tilted f arthest fr om the Ear th,” this cycle is not impor tant for astr onomer s—and, appar ently , still does not pr esent the synchr onized r elationship en visioned b y Argüelles. “The apsidal cycle is not 28 da ys b ut a 311 da y o verrun after 8 y ear s,” notes John Mar tineau, astr onomer and author of A Little Book of Coincidence . Argüelles suppor ts his calendar as our solution b y noting that the female menstr ual cycle naturally follo ws a tw enty-eight-da y rh ythm. But this is not the case . Accor ding to biolo gists, this cycle , when synchr onized, mor e closely appr oximates the 29.6-da y inter val that separates full moons. While Argüelles is cor rect that the tw elv e-month Gr egor ian calendar is a solar ab­ straction, which could be supplanted b y a mor e accurate and har monic cal­ endar , the thir teen-moon system he pr oposes is a lunar abstraction, hence equally off-kilter .

While it seems oddly r emote and minor to our moder n minds— cer tainly , g rowing up under the bar ely visib le skies of Manhattan, I had never g iven it consideration—this pr oblem r ecur s with star tling fr equency in our m ytholo gies, f ables, and f airy tales. As Heath notes, it is pr esent in the f airy-tale classic Sleeping Beauty , originally kno wn as Briar Rose , which beg ins when the king plans to in vite the thir teen wise w omen in his land to a banquet to celebrate the bir th of his daughter , but cannot in vite the last one as he has only tw elv e golden plates. The unin vited thir teenth wise woman ar rives in a fur y, and cur ses the kingdom, sending the cour t and princess into a long sleep . The f airy tale offer s “a pr ophetic w arning con­ cer ning what automaticall y will happen when the feminine , and hence lu­ nar , qualities of life ar e neglected. ” The n umber tw elv e symbolizes masculine solar rationality; thir teen “is very much connected with the Moon and hence to matter s matr iarchal and the old Goddess r elig ions, ” wr ites Heath. “The adv ent of Patriarchy, around 2000 BC , sa w to it that all matter s relating to lunar w orship , and hence the Moon, w ere systematically and thor oughly eliminated fr om the ne w cultur e”—a mind-set that led to the medie val witch hunts and still per me­ ates W ester n cultur e toda y. In m ytholo gy, the inter play betw een solar tw elv e and lunar thir teen is indicated b y the stor y of Jesus and the T welv e Disciples, King Ar thur and his T welv e Knights, and Quetzalcoatl (K ukulcan), who w as the leader of thir teen gods befor e his m yster ious disappearance . “The tw o n umber s tw elve and thir teen, juxtaposed whene ver our cultur e seeks to identify a superher o figur e, such as J esus, King Ar thur or the Ma yan K ukulcan, point to a cul­ tural legacy which appear s to be calendraic in or igin, naturally fundamen­ tal to the imm utab le n umber s of Sun and Moon, ” Heath wr ites.

Other r efer ences in the same scr iptural passage r elate to the ancient pr oblem of solar-lunar integ ration. The n um­ ber 12.369 is also the h ypoten use of a tr iangle made with the pr opor tions 5:12:13, which Heath calls the “lunation tr iangle ,” used in the ancient World as “an astonishingly v aluab le tool for perfor ming a range of astr o­ nomically pr ecise tasks, ” including for ecasts of solar positions and lunar phases. Heath belie ves that the site of Stonehenge w as chosen because it created an enor mous lunation tr iangle , str etching to the Pr eseli islands in Wales, fr om which the mon ument’ s boulder s w ere remo ved, and to the sa­ cred island of Lundy , dir ectly east of the mon ument. This instr ument of ancient measur ement w as thus inscr ibed, in massi ve scale , into the landscape , in per petuity , to guar d against its loss. Again and again, these m yths seem to suggest that the seemingly in­ nocuous calendar is actually of fundamental impor tance , defining our r ela­ tionship to r eality—as Argüelles r ealized in his call for a ne w “timing frequency .” A calendar that f ails to balance solar and lunar elements, that does not cor respond to natural cycles, will enfor ce, and self-r einfor ce, a de­ for med w orld. Heath wr ites: “Ev olution is caused b y the cycles of the lu­ minar ies and Man cannot detach fr om their impor tance if only because he is wholly for med (mater ially at least) b y the effects of these tw o bodies and their ceaseless gyrations—their Sacr ed Mar riage .” What our science under­ stands abstractly about the e volutionar y eng ine of the “Sun, Moon, Ear th system, ” Neolithic man ma y ha ve realized intuiti vely and instincti vely, cod­ ifying his under standing in mon umental w orks of stone .

The standar d liberal, feminist, or left-wing cr itique of our society sees it as a patr iarchal dominator cultur e, repr essing the feminine and the natu­ ral. Ther e is, of cour se, a g reat deal of truth to this. As discussed earlier , the lunar , feminine , and intuiti ve aspects of being w ere systematically sup­ pressed as small-scale tr ibal societies ga ve way to ag rarian and industr ial ci v­ ilization, pr ior itizing solar , masculine rationality .

In the Kali Y uga, it is the feminine cur­ rent of Shakti energy that has gone ber serk—lik e an electr ic line that is cut, shooting out sparks—not the masculine Shi va pr inciple of consciousness. As Nik olas and Zeena Schr eck wr ite in Demons of the Flesh, a study of sex mag ic: “Dur ing this Aeon, the lunar , sinister cur rent of the Feminine Dai­ monic is at its zenith, a spir itual condition which allo ws for the br eaking up of all boundar ies and the fr ee pla y of creati ve chaos, unr estr icted b y the male or der ing pr inciple .” The Kali Y uga could be character ized as the god­ dess Shakti thr owing a hissy fit.

The Abor iginal w ay of life ma y ha ve gone on, essentially unchanged until the ar rival of the Eu­ ropeans, for as long as for ty thousand y ear s. The Abor iginals consider ed w omen to be naturally connected to the divine and cr eati ve for ces in the uni verse thr ough their fer tility and menstr u­ ation cycles.

Men w ere consider ed child-lik e, essentially useless, until the y completed their initiation. Under­ going a training that could last as long as ten y ear s, men w ould de velop the capacity to access the Dr eamtime thr ough a ser ies of danger ous and diffi­ cult or deals. Common initiator y practices included not only solitar y fasts and w alkabouts, b ut scar ification and subcision—the infliction of wounds on the male member , that could be r eopened at an y time , as a kind of sym­ bolic menstr uation. Such practices ar tificially induced men into female sta­ tus, g iving them the sacralizing w ound g ranted to w omen b y natur e. In Abor iginal society , as in other endur ing for ms of nomadic cultur es, women pr ovided the coher ing, stabilizing for ce for the tr ibe .

It is possib le, as La wlor suggests, that their innate propensity for gather ing has r easser ted itself as a cultural obsession with shopping. Similarly , for men, the obsessi ve focus r equir ed for hunting—as well as the energetic hunting of shamanism—has been defor med into workplace competition, fixation on spor ts statistics, and other tr ivia. “The fully sensual life of the Abor igines, their deeply spir itual com­ munication with the ear th, and their unshakab le belief in their Ancestral Laws cr eated an Abor iginal psycholo gy that w as disinter ested in acquir ing and possessing mater ial things, ” La wlor wr ites in Voices of the First Da y.

The y allo wed for mono gamous couples and polygamous men, as w ell as extramar ital liaisons. The y consider ed sexually unsatisfied w omen to be danger ous for the har mon y of the tr ibe , and w ould pair off young men un­ dergoing initiation with older w omen who w ere wido wed or alone . The wider range of relationship patter ns among the Abor iginals, and man y other human cultur es, suggest that our cultur e’s singular focus on mono gam y is not natural, b ut socially conditioned.

Eur opean man’ s incessant pr obing of natur e could be seen as a quest for kno wledge of the lost and defiled goddess whose body is the w orld. As Francis Bacon put it at the beg inning of the moder n era of scientific pr ogress: “W e m ust tor tur e Natur e until she r eveals her se­ crets. ” Moder n science has ne ver lost its sadistic tinge . Kali’ s wrath is a r e­ action to the denig ration of natur e and w oman at the cor e of our cultur e, par t of the histor ical mo vement to separate and seek transcendence fr om our bodily natur e. In the laborator y, the scientist sought to under stand the w ound in­ flicted on him b y the agg rieved feminine . What Virg inia W oolf called the “ster ile brass beak of the male” peck ed away at reality . The cr eations of the rational intellect, cut off from the fer tilizing influence of feminine intu­ ition, r eflected our disconnection fr om natur e; the masculine desir e to sup­ plant organic pr ocesses with technolo gical ones culminated in the atomic bomb , kno wn as “Oppenheimer’ s bab y,” that w as “deli vered” o ver Hir oshima.

Similarly , when the scientific mind tur ned its attention to human sex­ uality , it disco vered no nor mati ve standar d, b ut endless differ ence . In the 1950s, the scandalous Kinsey Repor t revealed that human sexual v ariety w as essentially infinite , and that each per son w as distinct in their er otic desir es and patter ns. Despite such e vidence , our model of relationships contin ues to enfor ce a cookie-cutter appr oach, enshr ining mono gam y as the stan­ dar d. Accor ding to Laura Kipnis, a pr ofessor of comm unications at Nor th­ wester n Uni versity , our f ailur e to confr ont and ar ticulate difficult issues around sexuality and r omantic lo ve reverberates acr oss our social and polit­ ical w orld. “Wh y not at least enter tain the possibility that ther e could be for ms of daily life based on something other than isolated households and sexually exclusi ve couples?” she ask ed in her 2004 polemic , Against Lov e. “Wh y not confr ont rather than ignor e the r eality of disappointment at the deadening r outinization that per vades mar ried households?

If women w ant to do the w ork of integ rating their shado w, the y will have to follo w the traces of Kali—addr essing the subtle and unsubtle w ays the y ha ve misused Shakti energy—within their o wn li ves. Men, on the other hand, ha ve to confr ont their catastr ophic loss of soul, their forfeiting of intuiti ve and emotional depths. This condition is illustrated b y another myth—the medie val legend of the Fisher King. The Fisher King suffer s from a w ound in the g roin that will not heal, as his kingdom atr ophies. Ac­ cor ding to the J ung ian commentator Rober t Johnson, the Fisher King leg­ end descr ibes the “w ounded feeling function” that afflicts moder n man, who suppr essed intuition and emotion to attain technolo gical rationality and one-sided dominance . Johnson notes that the English language r eflects our emotional paucity .

The par ents of these r uined childr en also r uined themselv es in the end, becoming debauched car icatur es, their quest for liberation ending in dr uggy dissolution or monotonous nar cissism.

The opposites contained in the unconscious r un the gam ut fr om lo ve and compassion to vicious cr uelty and sadism, the depths as w ell as the heights of our potential. “Yahw eh is not split, b ut is an antinom y—a total­ ity of inner opposites—and this is the indispensab le condition for his tremendous dynamism, ” J ung wr ote . The bib lical nar rati ve descr ibes the humanization of the God-image , culminating in his incar nation as the half-human, half-di vine Chr ist, a manifestation of the “good God. ” This incar nation r equir ed a dissociation fr om Satan, his dark er half , who w as witnessed, b y Chr ist, f alling fr om Hea ven to Ear th. When ar chetypal mater ial constellates in an indi vidual psyche , accor d­ ing to the J ung ian model, the exper ience is not one of overflo wing potency , but of weakness and helpless rage . The le vel of anguish and hu­ miliation in volv ed in the descent of an ar chetype depends on the indi vid­ ual’ s le vel of awareness: “If ther e is little consciousness attached to the event, then the ego becomes the trag ic victim of the ar chetype that it is constellating, ” Edinger wr ote . “If ther e is mor e consciousness in volv ed, then the ego does not ha ve to be the trag ic victim because it kno ws what is happening to it. It beha ves in a m uch differ ent w ay and can mediate the archetypal patter n m uch differ ently .” In the book of Job, wr itten se veral centur ies befor e the Ne w T estament, Yahw eh subjects his “f aithful ser vant, ” Job, to a har rowing ser ies of tests, after accepting a w ager fr om Satan that J ob’ s faith can be br oken. “Job is no mor e than the outw ard occasion for an inw ard pr ocess of dialectic in God, ” wrote J ung.

Despite his o verpowering might, the cr eator fear s the judgment of his creatur e. “Yahw eh pr ojects on to J ob a sk eptic’ s face which is hateful to him because it is his o wn, and which gazes at him with an uncann y and cr itical eye,” Jung noted. From the per specti ve of the God-image , Job had attained a higher state of kno wledge than Y ahw eh thr ough his tra vails, and this r e­ quir ed a compensator y sacr ifice , enacted, a fe w hundr ed y ear s later , thr ough the incar nation of Chr ist. Jung r ealized that God intended to fully incar nate in the collecti ve body of humanity , and that this time w as quickly appr oaching. From his psychoanalytic and per sonal w ork and theor etical m usings, he pr oposed that the Chr istian T rinity of Father , Son, and Holy Ghost w as unfolding into a “quater nity ,” adding a four th element that had been suppr essed fr om the W ester n psyche . “The enigma of squar ing the cir cle” w as one r epr e­ sentation of this quater nity , “an age-old and pr esumab ly pr e-histor ic sym­ bol, al ways associated with the idea of a w orld-cr eating deity .” This aspect of divinity , no w r etur ning and r equir ing assimilation into consciousness, was the De vil, who had been dissociated fr om the W ester n psyche at the beg inning of the J udeo-Chr istian aeon. Along with the De vil, the four th element also r epr esented natural wisdom, per sonified b y the Gnostic deity Sophia, long exiled and excised fr om the canonical texts. Since the cr eator is an antinom y, a totality of inner opposites, his cr ea­ tur e reflects this schism. To descend into humanity , God m ust choose “the creatur ely man filled with darkness—the natural man who is tainted with original sin, ” J ung wr ote . “The guilty man is eminently suitab le and is ther efor e chosen to become the v essel for the contin uing incar nation, not the guiltless one who holds aloof from the w orld, and r efuses to pa y his tribute to life , for in him the dark God w ould find no r oom. ” The uniting of the opposites, the r econciliation of dark and light contained in the God- image , can only tak e place within the consciously r ealized “guilty man, ” not the sanctimonious, ascetic , or self-r ighteous one—an yone who denies their shado w will only pr oject it in some ne w for m."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"2012 347 “The ar chetypes themselv es cannot e volv e into full consciousness with­ out being r outed thr ough a mor tal ego to br ing that consciousness into r e­ alization, ” Edinger wr ote .

After a while , I became impatient—with the fir st pr iestess pr esent, I could no longer k eep the dis­ cussion on a theor etical plane . “For instance , I lo ve the fir st pr iestess, ” I said. “I felt she ga ve str ong in­ dications she w anted to be with me .

In the dr eam, I seemed to per ceive our space-time r ealm, with its finite dimensions, and the atemporal transcen­ dent r ealm of the or igin and the ar chetype as tw o vibrating matr ices, shooting sparks of lightning betw een each other .

We paused for a long silent meditation. With e yes closed, celestial deities, dakinis, winged Apollonian messenger s whirled and r ushed to ward me , bear ing offer ings of flowers and fr uit. I noticed the pr esence of a dark er figur e b y my left side r eaching to ward me—I w as scar ed to look in his dir ec­ tion. Was this another sor cer ous emissar y fr om some twilight demon zone? Finally , I peek ed. Ther e, in m y vision, w as P adr inho Alfr edo himself , smil­ ing at me softly , w aiting to shak e m y hand.

As w e resumed our sing ing, I sa w and felt the pr esence of a vast being—feminine , angelic—twirling abo ve us, her incor por eal body for med fr om patter ns of rain and par ticles of astral light. I under stood this w as the Mother of the Forest, b lessing and n urtur ing us. Later in the night, I began to lose m y focus; the visions became less paradisiacal and mor e ambiguous as m y energy shifted do wnw ard. Padr inho Alfr edo inter rupted the sing ing and spok e, with P adr inho Luis Fernando translating, about this, exactly . Again and again, he used the w ord “fir mness”—it w as necessar y to r emain fir m, to concentrate the mind’ s at­ tention upw ard, to ward the light.

If I had, perhaps, de veloped m y in­ tellectual skills mor e than P adr inho Alfr edo , he had attained a deeper le vel of soul de velopment, which w as a differ ent wisdom. I recei ved another star tling insight, r ising fr om the depths of my psy­ che . In one flash of under standing, I seemed to appr ehend the or igin of my painfully tangled situation with the fir st pr iestess. I recalled our tr ip to Ha waii, our fir st m ushr oom cer emon y, wher e she had been told that in a past life , she w as the br ide of Ashoka, a Buddhist potentate in India. In her vi­ sions she had spok en with him. I had not thought m uch of this at the time—it seemed par t of the mag ical r ealism of our idyllic w eek to gether . I had ne ver belie ved in specific past li ves, par ticularly if the y w ere associated with celebrated per sonages. That kind of thing seemed to belong to the nai ve spir itual trappings of the o vereager Ne w Age . All of a sudden, I beheld f aint visions and scenes—the pr iestess as veiled dancer , m yself as Asiatic potentate w atching her—and felt the emo­ tional impr int of a long-lost bond. I seemed to access an older for m of my consciousness, as psychic fr equency or vibrational tone . One le vel of my awareness w as shear ed do wn to its essence , isolating something lik e a back­ ground hum, which I felt b ut could ne ver identify befor e. What r emained was a w arrior mentality , almost too chilled for m y moder n per sonality to accept. Ashoka’ s spir it—if that w as what it w as—w as lik e a knife that cut to the cor e, coolly and accurately . The mar tial fer ocity of this energy had r e­ tur ned to me dur ing the Mar s conjunction at Bur ning Man, intr oducing a new per specti ve on the “w ar of the sex es,” focusing m y attention on the Kali energy dominating the planet, and leading me to r evie w m y life thr ough the pr ism of Kali’ s wrath. Accor ding to Amit Gos wami’ s thesis on r eincar nation, cer tain li ves ar e cor related via “quantum nonlocality ,” having pr ivileged access to each other through “nonlocal infor mation transfer .” As I r eco gnized what seemed to be a past incar nation, I r ecei ved an intuiti ve do wnload about what had tran­ spir ed in that long-ago epoch. What I r eco vered w as that fir st pr iestess had been captur ed dur ing a w ar and for cib ly tak en as one of my brides. She had"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"364 Daniel Pinchbeck intr oduced me to Buddhism, as w ell as T antra, and helped to change m y path away from militar y conquest to the Buddhist pur suit of enlighten­ ment. Confr onting the hor rors of war, Ashoka had r ealized the tr uth of the Buddha’ s dictum, “If one man kills a hundr ed men, and another man master s himself , that second man is the m uch g reater w arrior.” He had dedicated the r est of his life to this goal. As bizar re as this seemed, it explained the sa vager y of the v oice that screamed in m y head, night after night, demanding that I be with the priestess. The v oice seemed a r esidue of that past incar nation, expr essing the er otic entitlement of an Indian emper or fr om the thir d centur y BC , de­ manding the r etur n of his consor t. Perhaps it also explained the needlessly brutal e-mail I had sent the pr iestess in Ne w Y ork, pr oposing w e explor e a Tantr ic practice—at that point, I had no idea I actually meant w e should resume one . Whether w e had tr ipped into a literal past life , or accessed some ar chetypal patter n, I found it extraor dinar y that the fir st pr iestess w as fulfilling a r ole in the pr esent situation that w as dir ectly analo gous to the one she w ould ha ve pla yed in our pr evious life , when she had br ought me to Buddhism. This time ar ound, she had br ought me to the teacher and, thr ough the teacher , to the Santo Daime . THE NEXT MORNING , I pulled the teacher aside and ask ed if we could con­ fer in pr ivate. Sitting b y the cool bathing str eam near our shack, I told her about m y ongoing Quetzalcoatl exper ience , and the pr ophetic transmission I w as r ecei ving. She ask ed to hear it, and I r ead it to her . When I w as fin­ ished, she smiled. She told me that, man y y ear s ago , she had had a ser ies of dreams wher e she w as a g irl and Quetzalcoatl, in the for m of a g igantic feather ed ser pent, came to visit her , swirling ar ound her lik e a Chinese dragon. The mood of these dr eams w as fr iendly , even gentle . “I w as sur­ prised in the dr eams that such a po werful being could be so pla yful, ” she recalled. “I am sur prised y ou ar en’ t mor e sur prised b y my stor y,” I said. “I kne w y ou w ere in a major pr ocess, ” she said. “That’ s wh y I w anted you on this tr ip.” She said she had w atched me wr iting while w e were on"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"2012 365 the boat, organizing the text of the transmission, and sensed a po werful force en veloping me . She w ork ed with other people who w ere recei ving and mediating ar chetypal mater ial—abo ve all, she had her transfor mati ve exper iences with the Mother . She also r ecalled witnessing the r ing ar ound the Sun that mor ning in Brasília and inter preted it—as I did—as a sign. “When I go back to Ne w Y ork and tr y to tell people about all of this, who is going to be ab le to under stand?” I ask ed. “Some will under stand, ” she said, “b ut y ou will see other s look up for a moment while y ou ar e speaking, and then fold back do wn again as soon as y ou ar e done . When y ou see them folding o ver—that is their kar ma at w ork. ” I ask ed if we could meet with the fir st pr iestess again, and the teacher went to get her . I shar ed the Quetzalcoatl transmission, and then told her of my insight about our possib le past life to gether . The energy immediately clear ed betw een us. The pr iestess said she felt “g reatly r elie ved” to ha ve reached this under standing. I w as as w ell—although it did not liberate me from m y tor menting desir e for her , at least I could attr ibute it to a theor et­ ical or igin. THERE W AS ANO THER DAY of working at the feitio . The y taught us the batisan, the rh ythmic and hea vily ph ysical labor of pounding the vine into strands with hea vy mallets, befor e it w as boiled with the lea ves in huge metal v ats set in concr ete . Each component in the making of the medicine was made sacr ed with sing ing and pra yer. I focused m y frustration into the ritualistic smashing of the vines.

When he had consolidated his rule , he conquer ed the Kalinga Empir e to the south, killing one hundr ed thousand enem y soldier s and v ast n umber s of civilians, gaining the nick­ name “Ashoka the Fier ce.” His per sonal r evulsion at the magnitude of this slaughter is said to ha ve inspir ed his con version to Buddhism’ s peaceful ways. One of his inscr iptions pr oclaims, “De vanampr iya, the conquer or of the Kalingas, is r emor seful no w, for this conquest is no conquest, since ther e was killing, death and banishment of the people . Devanampr iya k eenly feels all this with pr ofound sor row and r egret.” Upon tur ning to Buddhism, Ashoka instituted go vernment based on dhar ma—a w ord variab ly translated as “r ighteousness, ” “moral or der ,” “duty ,” “tr uth, ” or , mor e specifically , the body of teachings of the Buddha. As par t of this unique exper iment in just r uler ship , he r educed tax b urdens, built r est houses along highw ays, planted tr ees acr oss his empir e, instituted a policy of relig ious tolerance , eliminated most for ms of capital punish­ ment, and cr eated a class of administrator s schooled in dhar mic pr inciples.

This assimilation of previous for ms of consciousness would initiate what Gebser ter med the integ ral str uctur e—character ized by acausal unfolding and transfor mation—gaining author ity as the systems of governance , economics, and thought cur rently dominating our w orld quickly collapse .

The king perfor ms the function of “center ing the w orld, ” maintaining or­ der fr om his place at the center of the cosmic axis. If a similar task of “w orld-center ing” w as r equir ed to shift our contemporar y ci vilization to a differ ent path, such an impetus could only come fr om outside the domi­ nant str uctur e—fr om the per specti ve, perhaps, of a some what bohemian and alienated intellectual, capab le b y cir cumstances of bir th and education of concei ving the entir e patter n, r ooted in the ne w modes of per ception developed b y the a vant-gar de mo vements of literatur e and ar t of the tw en­ tieth centur y, versed in the liberational cur rents of the radical counter cul­ tur e, and at the same time , rooted in empir icism and the pragmatic moder n mind-set.

ALTHOUGH WE DO NO T KNO W how the Classic Ma ya inter preted the prophetic culmination of their Long Count, Carl J ohan Calleman has elab­ orated a meticulously exact fractal model of time fr om the Ma yan calendar , in which human consciousness e volv es thr ough nine “Underw orlds, ” each twenty times f aster in linear time than the pr evious one . Each underw orld passes thr ough a thir teen-stage pr ocess of alter nating light and dark energy cur rents—or se ven “da ys” and six “nights” of creation—culminating in a new le vel of realization. Accor ding to Calleman’ s model, sometime ar ound the y ear 2008—the “fifth night” of the cur rent underw orld, r uled b y the energ ies of Tezcatlipoca, the jaguar god of night and b lack mag ic—our cur rent socioeconomic system will suffer a drastic and ir revocab le collapse . The pr imar y catalyst for this collapse could be an appr oaching energy cr i­ sis. A r epor t recently issued b y the U .S.
