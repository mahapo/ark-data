Like Homer’s Odyssey, How SoonIs Now? is a song of redemption for a world torn apart by the monsters of ourown creation. We’ve dreamed up a world that is consuming itself into extinction.Pinchbeck offers us a new dream, and in doing so takes us on a powerful, magicalvoyage into balance and sanity.’John Perkins author of Confessions of an Economic Hit Man‘Daniel Pinchbeck has emerged as a rational and clear voice of hope for a newpost-capitalist future, offering alternatives to hack democracy for a bettersociety. His expert knowledge of shamanism and ancient cultures has given him aquantum perspective from which to approach our contemporary crisis. A powerfulvoice providing a new narrative for alternative social movements. Pinchbeck is aprophetic changeagent with a serious message of hope.’Jefferson Hack, CEO & Founder, Dazed and Confused‘Not only is it “sooner than you think”, it’s also later than you think. Here weare, humanity, caught in the moment between devolution and conscious evolutionby choice not chance. Daniel Pinchbeck’s new book takes us to this exactinflection point and reveals with remarkable clarity and brilliance that We DoKnow What To Do in almost every field from spiritual to social to environmental,with innovations arising everywhere. He asks the Great Question: Then why are wenot doing it? Let’s all read it and say Yes to what we do know How to do. Let’sform humanity’s Burning Man team and light the fire of love in action togetherNOW!’Barbara Marx Hubbard, visionary, social innovator and chair of the Foundationfor Conscious Evolution‘How Soon Is Now? offers a spiritually driven approach to global economic andecological crisis. This is the process through which humanity can bring itselfback from the brink. With dangerous and admirable honesty, Pinchbeck tests hisdeepest-held assumptions and judges his life choices in a crucible ofself-doubt. It’s at once an initiation for himself, and an invitation for us toask these same sorts of questions of ourselves as individuals and a society.I’ve changed my mind about this guy, and am glad to call him my friend.’ DougRushkoff, writer, documentarian and lecturer‘This provocative and honest book pushes the climate change conversation wellbeyond its usual edges. It conveys the enormity of the changes before us – inpolitics, the economy, and technology of course, but also in our psychology andeven our metaphysics. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to make sense ofclimate change within a bigger picture that includes the evolution ofcivilization and consciousness.’Charles Eisenstein, speaker and author of Sacred Economics‘Provides deep insight into the essential issues of our time . . . could sparkthe revolution of consciousness that is the revolution not just of thinking, butof acting.’Ervin Laszlo, author and founder of The Club of Budapestimages [images/9781780289724_sam.jpg]Also by Daniel PinchbeckBreaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of ContemporaryShamanism2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl(published in the UK as 2012: The Year of the Mayan Prophecy)Notes from the Edge Times"},{"pageContent":"HOW SOON IS NOW?From Personal Initiation toGlobal TransformationDANIEL PINCHBECKPreface by STINGIntroduction by RUSSELL BRANDimages [images/9781780289724_img01.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTSAcknowledgements [05_9781780289724_Acknowledgements.html]Preface by Sting [06_9781780289724_Preface.html]Introduction by Russell Brand [07_9781780289724_Introduction.html]Part One Planetary Initiation [08_9781780289724_PartOne.html] 1 Burning Down the House [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html]Revolution for the Hell of It [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link01] ; SystemChange [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link02] ; Climate Chaos[09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link03] ; Sandy [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link04]; Riding High [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link05] ; The Day of the Dead[09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link06] ; What Happens Next?[09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link07] ; Psi [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link08] ;Prophecy [09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link09] ; Rebellion and the Sacred[09_9781780289724_Ch01.html#link10] 2 Ecstatic Contact with the Cosmos[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html]A Coll10_9781ective Rite of Passage [10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link11] ; ThePrefrontal Cortex [10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link12] ; My Journey[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link13] ; Biocentrism[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link14] ; Sex and Drugs[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link15] ; Global Reboot[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link16] ; Competition to Cooperation[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link17] ; The Noosphere[10_9781780289724_Ch02.html#link18]Part Two Hard Limits [11_9781780289724_PartTwo.html] 3 Earth Changes [12_9781780289724_CH03.html]Dread or Detachment?

Individually as well as collectively, we only makeprogress when we find ourselves out of our comfort zone. The evolutionary recordis full of short-lived species that could not adapt to change.Because of our impact upon the planet, humanity is in imminent danger of joiningthis list. Earth may need a rest from its pathological guests. DanielPinchbeck’s How Soon Is Now? seeks to address the enormous disconnect betweenour current activities as a species and the Earth’s ecology. Deep down, we allknow that the current status quo can’t continue much longer, since there aremany signs that it is already starting to crumble.As I write this, Britain reels in shock from Brexit at the very time that globalunity is needed; a fear-mongering, climate change-denying billionaire may becomethe next US president; and summer has come to northern Alaska earlier than itever has before. Whatever the eventual consequences of such events, they suggestthat we can no longer operate on the principle of ‘business as usual’, orbelieve that ‘normality’ will persist, or rely on our unravelling institutions.How Soon Is Now? gives us the context we need to understand the chaos andturbulence of our times. For me, the take-home idea is that the biosphericemergency facing us is somehow wired into our DNA, forcing us to make anevolutionary leap as a species. I find this a compelling way of looking at ourperilous situation, one that takes us beyond the stale rhetoric of politicalparties. It may be that many, if not most, of our problems are due to a poorlevel of understanding about the realities we face.According to many scientists who study global warming, we are quicklyapproaching the point of no return. Although most of us don’t want to face theevidence, we need to find the courage to confront it now – not just for our ownsake, but because climate change will impact the lives of our children and theirchildren. One thing I appreciate about this book is Daniel’s no-blame stance,which could be more strategically effective for bringing about change thancalling out the usual scapegoats. While we can’t let our more egregiouscorporate offenders off the hook, the more important point is that we and theyare all part of the same system – a system that itself needs a redesign.Likewise, Daniel’s even-handed overview of revolution and its often disastrousresults points to a new wisdom.As Daniel points out in How Soon Is Now?, despite the very real dangers we face,the potential during this time is enormous. But we can only realize it byfinding the courage to face the threats to our existence on this planet and cometogether to act as one."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONBY RUSSELL BRANDIfirst encountered Daniel through his 2010 documentary, 2012: Time for Change. Iwas interested in the ideas swirling around back then that saw the year 2012 –the end of the 5,125-year-long Mayan calendar – as some sort of apocalypticthreshold. Daniel instead envisioned the prophetic due-date as an opportunityoffered to humanity for a great awakening of consciousness and a global reboot –one that would depend on our actions.In Daniel’s film, I found all sorts of mind-changing information aboutalternative social systems, economic models and ways of thinking. I encounteredthe prophetic ideas of the freethinking social architect Buckminster Fuller, whoin 1969 said humanity now faces a choice: oblivion or utopia. The film resonatedwith me on many levels. I reached out to Daniel after I saw it.Like Daniel, I have come to understand that we first of all need something likea revolution of consciousness and a profound transformation of our socialsystems if we want to avert short-term regression into the primitiveauthoritarianism with which we are now threatened, as well as long-termecological meltdown. I agree with him that this revolution is not simply amatter of changing our political or economic system; the solution has to beprimarily spiritual and secondarily political.This is something that the traditional left still doesn’t get. The naturaltribal leaders of the left are atheists, and they see the socialist orpost-capitalist future as inescapably godless. Since the last century there hasbeen a belief that religion, devotion and any idea of God must be discarded.However, once we have abandoned any sense of a sacred relation to the earth orthe cosmos, we are left with nothing but a flat, depressing reality. Thenihilism inherent in this worldview inexorably leads to addictions, egotism andother manias.Through a new embrace of spirituality we must prioritize our connection to oneanother and the planet over other, lesser goals. Buckminster Fuller succinctlyoutlined what ought be our collective objectives: ‘to make the world work for100 per cent of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneousco-operation without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone’. Isn’tthat simply sensible, considering the ever-increasing power of our technologies,and the new communications networks that link humanity together instantly?As Daniel explores in How Soon Is Now?, most of us in the postindustrial Westhave become prisoners of comfort in the absence of meaning. As a people, we livewithout a unifying myth. As the comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell haspointed out, our global problems are all due to the lack of relevant myths. Thisis a powerful insight. One thing that Daniel seeks to do in this book is tooffer some elements of a possible new mythic structure, along with a blueprintfor the future. His ideas have been drawn from tribal shamanism and quantumphysics, as well as evolutionary biology and the cutting-edge of developments infields like energy, sustainability and industrial design. He envisions a systembased on cooperation rather than competition that will allow our children andtheir children to live in relative peace and harmony, without furtherannihilating the earth’s fragile ecosystems, as we are now doing at a rapidclip.Through my own explorations of yoga and meditation I have become increasinglycomfortable with a mystical view on the nature of reality. I believe that as wewake up we have an opportunity, and even a responsibility, to deal with peopleas if they are divine – knowing that within them, ultimately, there is adivinity. The Christian mystic Emmet Fox wrote, ‘Regardless of another person’sbehavior, the Christ within them is calling out to you.’ Christ represents thearchetype of the higher Self, which we all have individually, and which ourspecies as a whole also possesses.Daniel has a great ability to précis information and make ideas that aredifficult to understand quite accessible. He also proposes ideas that may seem,at first, objectionable – like having compassion for corporations andunderstanding that, even though multinationals have been incredibly destructive,they are also part of our evolution and could be repurposed for the good. Thismay rankle many of us. I think this is a good thing. When you have reached animpasse, it is ideas that seem objectionable or absurd at first that may providethe solution. Quite obviously, the old ways of looking at things are no longerhelping us. We need new ideas and insights.The spiritual counterculture and New Age movement of the last decades focused onthe power of presence, the awareness of awareness. This was good, as far as itwent, but now we need to go one step further. As a new myth for this time,Daniel proposes we approach the multilevel crisis of civilization nowconfronting us as a great opportunity for awakening and initiation. We can focuson the great task that Fuller set for us: to make the world comprehensivelysuccessful for all.Although we don’t realize it, we already live within successive cycles ofrevolution that are occurring faster and faster. The Agricultural Revolutiontook thousands of years; the Industrial Revolution took hundreds; theTechnological Revolution took tens. The Spiritual Revolution is coming – as soonas now – and we have only an instant to act."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEPLANETARY INITIATIONimages [images/9781780289724_img02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1BURNING DOWN THE HOUSEOnce, a decade ago – on 1 September 2005, just around sundown, to be exact, Itried to incite a global revolution. The incident remains one of the proudestand, at the same time, one of the most humiliating events of my life. It wasinspired by a potent psychedelic catalyst, and Hurricane Katrina.I was at the Burning Man festival at the time. As almost everyone knows by now,Burning Man, a massive annual anarcho-libertarian pseudo-utopian art event,takes place in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada every summer. The festival hasgrown rapidly over the last years. It has captured the attention of the globalmedia as celebrities and Silicon Valley billionaires flock to it.I remember, after my plane landed at Reno airport, passing TV monitors showingsatellite images of Hurricane Katrina’s ominous octopus arms, its vastspiralling dimensions. On the news, weathermen were plotting its likely coursetowards Louisiana. The emergency seemed surreal to me, an event that had nothingto do with my life.By the time Katrina hit New Orleans, Burning Man was going strong. Thousands ofcostumed revellers danced each night, roaming the city during the day. Back inthose days, nobody checked the Internet while at the festival. There was no cellphone service either. I found out about Katrina from friends who arrived on theplaya late in the week. They described its devastating impact. I learned thatthe government had corralled 15,000 poor people, mostly African-American, in theLouisiana Superdome, in unsanitary conditions without water or power. Riots werespreading across the South, according to the news they brought with them fromthe ‘default world’, and National Guard reserves were being called up. It seemedthat America – long a simmering cauldron of racial tension and class conflict –was on the verge of boiling over. Nobody at Burning Man knew – or cared.Riding across the desert that day in a dusky purple haze, I entered a state ofmessianic megalomania, outside of the normal constraints of time or personalnarrative. No longer held back by any sense of linear progress, or any concernfor future consequences, I believed that the fractally rhizomatic Now was theonly moment that mattered – the only moment that ever was. I felt fury at ourfailure, as a species, to overcome the ‘system’ – the military-industrialcomplex, Wall Street, the corporate mega-machine. This system was not onlycorrupt, creepy and hypocritical. It was also destroying the biosphere, and withit, our shared human future.Revolution for the Hell of ItI first visited Burning Man in 2000. I went there as a journalist, to write afeature on it for Rolling Stone. I didn’t have great hopes for what I would findthere. It seemed a self-congratulatory, hippie-ish thing. But when I visitedBlack Rock City, I realized the festival far exceeded what I had anticipated orimagined. Within a few days, it permanently expanded my sense of what humanitycould become.I discovered a huge, supportive, loving community focused on selfexpression,direct experience and personal freedom. Burners didn’t consider the explorationof consciousness to be marginal or worthless. Most understood it as a crucialexpression of human freedom. As a New Yorker, I had no idea that the psychedeliccounterculture on the West Coast had evolved in such spectacular style since theAcid Test days. The festival was an initiation, in itself. It was challenging tosurvive in that high desert, scorching hot during the days, frigid at night. Thefact that everyone had to endure the elements was part of the journey. We hadall chosen, intentionally, to experience this near-emergency. This brought ustogether and bonded us.Perhaps I should be embarrassed to admit this, but in the development of mypersonal political philosophy, Black Rock City holds a place that for me is ascrucial as the Paris Commune of 1870 was for Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.‘Working men’s Paris, with its Commune’, Marx enthused, ‘will be forevercelebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society.’ Although the Frenchgovernment stamped out the revolution, executing thousands, Marx went on towrite many books – proving it is safer to be an armchair revolutionary than thefighting-in-thestreets kind.The essential political insight I took from Burning Man was our capacity toreorganize society around principles quite different from the ones we have now.We can create a post-postmodern civilization where the pursuit of art, ecstasy,play and spiritual communion are central to its purpose. I believed a rapidglobal awakening was possible – and Burning Man pointed the way. Reinventing ourfragile world as a collective art project, we would apply our technical geniusand media savvy to liberate our human family, as a whole, from pointlesssuffering, destructive habits and outmoded belief systems.Naively, I assumed that everyone at Burning Man understood that the festival wassimply a prelude – a rehearsal for the main event. We were testing out theprinciples and ethos of a liberated society that at some point we would spreadacross the world rapidly. Eventually, we would engineer a metamorphosis of ourcivilization, re-creating it through the crucible of the imagination.But suddenly, that night in 2005, I saw Burning Man’s celebratory spectacle, forthe first time, as an artificial paradise distracting us from the sombre realitywe needed to confront. Those with the awareness and ability to change the worldwere caught in a hall of mirrors – a subtle trap. Burning Man was a temporaryautonomous zone, a beautiful desert mirage. It showed us what was possible, butit diverted our energy from the hard work of changing the system – fromconfronting the powers that be, in the real world. What it promoted was culturalrebellion, not social transformation. Burning Man had turned into a culture ofits own, which made people obedient and complacent.Enraged, I rode my bike to the Center Cafe. Inside, a large band of SanFrancisco hipsters was playing – drumming, banjo-ing, tooting horns – to afervent, gyrating crowd. I jumped on the stage and took the microphone from theMC – a stylish impresario known for his Steampunk couture, white top hat andimprobably long beard. Everyone was startled. The band stopped. I was already awell-known figure at the festival. A day before, I had given a talk to severalhundred people in the large geodesic dome of the Palenque Norte camp, as part oftheir speaker series. Some of my audience was in the crowd.I began to rant, semi-coherently, about Katrina, as well as the largerecological, geopolitical emergency confronting our species. I noted that many ofus had been coming to Burning Man for many years to celebrate, to party – I saidwe had partied enough. Now we can do something else together that might beequally fun: establish a sound foundation for a new socio-political order. Someof the crowd listened attentively. Some booed. Various attempts were made to getme off the stage so the band could resume. I ignored them.Finally, Paradox – a well-known circus performer in the Bay Area – convinced meto give up the mic. We went to sit outside together, in the dust. I was stillenraged. I grabbed him repeatedly, pulling his hair. This was the unlikelybeginning of a great friendship. As I spoke with him, still high as a kite, Ihatched an ambitious plan.I proposed that we stop the festival’s annual crescendo – the burning of the Manon Saturday, followed by the immolation of the Temple on Sunday. Instead, wewould invite the Burning Man community to stay in the desert for a few extraweeks while we drafted a planetary constitution together and built a socialnetwork and media platform to support the rapid transition to a regenerative,post-capitalist society. There were, I knew, so many brilliant people attendingthe event, leaders in many fields, from software to pop music to finance to law.Katrina was our opportunity to seize. Katrina had revealed the planetaryemergency in microcosm. We would use the disaster to tap the community’s geniusin a focused and organized way.I saw it all in a flash. One group of Burners – legal experts, softwareengineers, social scientists, anthropologists, financial analysts, workers atNGOs and more – would gather at the Center Cafe each day, to design and buildthe prototype for a new social infrastructure through a cooperative, consensusprocess. This networking platform would include tools for democraticdecision-making, sharing resources and alternative instruments for exchangingvalue, designed to first complement and then supersede the current money system.Another group of Burners – filmmakers, journalists, poets and artists – woulddocument the unfolding process as we wrote the planetary constitution, demandinga world based on ecological and social justice, equality, peace andrighteousness. Rather than making incremental and fitful progress, humanity as awhole would make a sudden forward leap.Around the Temple, the spiritual community of Burning Man – meditators, yogis,alchemists, Sufis, kabbalists, Wiccans – would gather in a circle for a24-hours-a-day ceremony in which they would visualize, meditate and bring downthe imprint for the new planetary culture – currently hovering above us,somewhere, in the starry night. Rock musicians, DJs, opera singers and otherperformers would play at the Man – a concert continuing around the clock,live-streamed to the outside world.I assumed the wealthier Burners would happily donate tens of thousands ofdollars apiece to have food and water trucked in from Reno, supporting thiscrucial process. Property would be collectivized, so people wouldn’t have towaste any valuable time. Instead of having to look for your bicycle in a thicketof bicycles, for instance, you could grab any available ride. Rather thanreturning to your camp, you could catch a snooze in any nearby trailer. We wouldbe living the revolution as we created it – we would be co-creating the New Now.As I hatched it, I thought this plan had tremendous PR potential. We wouldperform revolution as a conceptual art performance piece in real time. Iimagined our pitch to the world’s media: the community of counterculturalhedonists, hippies, druggies, geeks and Silicon Valley millionaires are making astand, taking charge of the planet’s future, at a time of ongoing war in theMiddle East, corporate malfeasance, natural disasters and climate meltdown.At first we would be mocked. But soon, the press – the global audience – wouldstop ridiculing us. They would grasp that this was the only way that massivesocial change could happen – from the dusty margins, the radical fringe. Once webuilt and launched our new peer-to-peer network for direct democracy and ouropen-source media platform promoting spiritual gnosis, equitable sharing of theworld’s resources for the evolution of consciousness, everybody on Earth wouldjump on board. I figured the whole process might take six months, give or take.By then, we would have even George Bush, Vladimir Putin, the Bilderberg elite,the Koch Brothers, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, the Sunni Imams and ShiiteAyatollahs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and the Chinese Premier solidly on ourside. We would sit down together to work things out, pausing for sessions ofMDMA-assisted group therapy when necessary.For the next two days, I didn’t sleep as I sought to execute my plan. I racedfrom Burning Man camp to camp, trying to form alliances, building a cadre ofvolunteers. At one New York camp, Disorient – an established Burning Man brand,known for its bright orange costumes and digitally sequenced flashing strobelights – I knocked a bottle of champagne out of one of the organizer’s hands,pissing him off as it dribbled fizz into the dust.‘Haven’t you done enough partying over the years?’ I yelled at him. When theytold me to leave, I lay down on the ground in protest. A few members ofDisorient dragged me out of the camp by my feet. I found it ludicrous that theywould drag me across the dust, from one blank spot to another – as if thecampground was real real estate.I gathered about twenty-five people together at my camp, Entheon Village,seeking to inspire them with my vision. Humouring me, friends as well as newconscripts took on the roles of lieutenants and subcommandants in a ragged,jester army. As it became clear we didn’t have the momentum we would need tostop the burning of the Man, my revolutionary project fizzled out.A big dream for the world – however foolish or futile – leaves lingering embersin its wake. Tiny incandescent sparks. I learned so much from this embarrassingenterprise – whether blind alley or foreshadowing, I am still not sure. For afew delusional hours, I felt something similar to what a member of the JacobinClub must have felt in 1789. I was convinced it was really happening. ‘Action isthe only reality,’ the Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman once realized while on LSD:like a whiteboard swiped clean, our social reality can be entirely re-createdand reinvented, given the proper circumstances and poetic serendipity.System ChangeBut why, you may ask, do we need system change? For many of us, the reasons areblindingly obvious. The Bernie Sanders presidential campaign presented theeconomic case clearly. The ever-widening gap between rich and poor has reachedDada-ist proportions. Less than eighty-five individuals control more wealth thanhalf the Earth’s population – 3.6 billion people. In the US, one-tenth of 1 percent of the population is worth more than the bottom 90 per cent. While a tinyelite has more power than ever before, vast multitudes look ahead fearfully.They see a future of shrinking hopes and increasing instability. As debtincreases faster than GDP around the world, the financial system tightens itsgrip, like a giant anaconda suffocating the poor and the middle class. Waves ofprotests and rebellions – the Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, Brexit –reveal the ire of the masses.We live in a post-colonial empire which uses violence – drone strikes, bombingraids, assassination, military invasion, extraordinary rendition – to impose itswill on the world, as well as employing sneakier techniques, like the ballooningdebts that countries across Africa, South America and Asia must pay theirEuropean and American overlords, while their resources are strip-mined away.This is already terrible. The even worse problem is that our industrialcivilization has unleashed an ecological mega-crisis. We are threatened with animminent planetary cataclysm that could drive us to extinction.‘Across the world today, our actions testify to our belief that we can go onlike this forever, burning oil, poisoning the seas, killing off other species,pumping carbon into the air, ignoring the ominous silence of our coal minecanaries in favour of the unending robotic tweets of our new digitalimaginarium,’ Roy Scranton writes in Learning to Die in the Anthropocene. ‘Yetthe reality of global climate change is going to keep intruding on our fantasiesof perpetual growth, permanent innovation and endless energy, just as thereality of mortality shocks our casual faith in permanence.’For reasons we will explore, there is a link between our unjust economic system– which forces constant growth while it disempowers the multitudes – and theecological catastrophe that will soon engulf us. We can’t solve one withoutsolving the other. As things go increasingly haywire, our species could easilyjoin all the other species we are currently driving into oblivion. This couldhappen within this century – within the next decades. Right now, all bets areoff.Meanwhile, the corporate elite and the technocrats continue to promote thepromise of new technologies to solve humanity’s problems. This sounds great intheory. Unfortunately, however, our engineers have no legitimate response tomany of the ecological problems we have created. Many of the ‘quick fixes’ theypromote – like geo-engineering – could make things far worse. As a whole,humanity is sleepwalking towards catastrophe, waiting for something or someoneelse – Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Richard Branson, Indigo Children,the Pope – to take care of it for us.As I’ve focused on the ecological crisis over the last years, I have sometimesfelt like Chicken Little, freaking out as I pointed to a seemingly blue,changeless sky. But as a quorum of scientists metaphorically agree, the sky isfalling. We can feel the changes taking place all around us. Many of thesolutions are blindingly obvious. But we are not applying them.Climate ChaosIn December 2015, world leaders met in Paris to hammer out an agreement aimed atrestricting the rise of global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius abovepre-industrial levels. Although this was celebrated as progress, it may have setback the climate movement significantly. According to a group of leading climatescientists, the pact failed to mandate the rapid, severe cuts to globalemissions that we actually need.‘What people wanted to hear was that an agreement had been reached on climatechange that would save the world while leaving lifestyles and aspirationsunchanged’, the scientists wrote. ‘The solution it proposes is not to agree onan urgent mechanism to ensure immediate cuts in emissions, but to kick the candown the road.’The Paris climate talks revealed, once again, the vast gap between what ispolitically feasible and what is ecologically necessary. Drastically to reduceCO2 pollution we would have to eliminate wasteful industries, severely limitconsumption, reduce air and car travel to the minimum and restrict meat-eatingglobally. If we want to save the Earth, in other words, billions of us have tochange our lifestyles. Nobody wants to think about this – and it is politicalsuicide to propose it because it goes against the logic of a global economybased on incessant growth. But our survival requires system change, not reform.The fastest way for a change to occur would be for the wealthy elite – or atleast a subset of them – to take responsibility for humanity’s currentpredicament, overcome the hypnotism of privilege and use their capital toengineer a rapid turnaround. I know that sounds unlikely. Another option wouldbe some form of revolution or global overturning of the current system,substituting new institutions for the dysfunctional ones we have now. I realizethat sounds pretty difficult also.It is much easier to build a lifeboat while you are still on dry land than totry to do it when you are caught in the middle of a neverending super-storm. Weare getting many foreshadowings of what is to come. But we keep ignoring them.SandyOn the evening of 29 October 2012, I was home in the East Village when HurricaneSandy hit. An hour into it, I walked down to my corner, out of curiosity. Iassumed the media had exaggerated the dangers of the storm, to boost ratings. Iwanted to see for myself. To my shock, I saw brackish floodwaters rising, comingup Avenue C, engulfing cars. People were coming out of restaurants to snappictures and selfies of this biblical menace. The police cars in front of thelocal precinct seemed to be floating, with water up to their windows. The floodtide was moving at a steady pace towards my street – towards my building.I went home, threw some clothes and my laptop into a backpack, and headed offtowards a friend’s house in SoHo, on higher ground, as wind lashed the treesback and forth. As I hurried away, a flash of light illuminated the ominouscloud cover. I heard a gigantic explosion behind me. It sounded like a bomb.Later on, I learned that the Con Edison power plant on 14th Street and Avenue Chad just blown up. An hour later, the entirety of downtown New York was plungedinto darkness. For the next few days, a large area of Manhattan was withoutpower.The morning after the storm, I walked back to my house. Everything was closedexcept for a few delis and restaurants serving hastily made sandwiches andcoffee out of thermoses. Deli workers were trying to get rid of everythingperishable from their refrigerators and freezers. In the East Village, peoplestood around on street corners, dazed expressions on their faces, inspecting thedamage from the flood. I biked uptown, to stay with my mother on the Upper WestSide, an area that was comparatively untouched.I was supposed to fly to Mexico the next day to give a TEDx talk at a festival,commemorating the Day of the Dead, in an old colonial town popular withexpatriates from the US and Europe. My talk was going to cover, in condensedform, the theme of this book: the ecological crisis as initiation – as anopportunity for us to engineer a self-willed, rapid mutation in humanconsciousness. But the airports were closed and my flight was cancelled. Iassumed I wouldn’t be able to go.Then I received a call with an invite to fly on a private jet to Mexico. The jetbelonged to a media mogul, the CEO of a major conglomerate. The CEO and his wifewere dedicated Burners – they were power players in the scene. They had startedthe festival in Mexico to bring some of the Burning Man vibe to their secondhome. They owned a beautiful villa overlooking the town as well as a companymaking the world’s most expensive tequila.Riding HighAs an aside, I should note that I have been on quite a ride since I attained amoderate level of fame as a psychedelic author and visionary. In 2007, whenSteven Colbert called me a ‘psychedelic drug advocate’ during our TV interview,he solidified my position as a public spokesman for the altered states andshamanic practices I had written about in my books.‘Timothy Leary died recently. We just got rid of him. Why do we need anotherone?’ he asked me on air.While I have taken pains to differentiate myself from Leary – the Harvardpsychology professor turned psychedelic psychopomp, called ‘the most dangerousman in America’ by Nixon, who told the 1960s generation to ‘tune in, turn on,and drop out’, with unfortunate consequences – I have inherited a bit of hissocial cachet as rebel and outsider.Over the last decade, I have had a unique opportunity to pass through manydifferent worlds, learning and carrying ideas from one to the next. For a GermanTV show, I wandered the streets of Paris with Alejandro Jodorowsky, legendarydirector of Holy Mountain, and psycho-magician. I flew in a chartered helicopterwith Sting and his family over crop circles in England, looking forextra-terrestrials. I hung out in the trenches of Occupy Wall Street withtousled anarchists. I visited the mountains of Colombia to study the rituals andphilosophy of the Kogi and Arawak people. I debated with the comedian RussellBrand in a geodesic dome in Utah. I visited a ‘free love’ community, started byGerman radicals, in rural Portugal. I helped organize a summit on climate changeat Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, with slick marketing geniuses andnon-profits like Greenpeace and 350.org. We failed to convince Zuckerberg’sminions to support the ecological movement with more than tokenism.As much as I could, I sought to influence the influencers. Particularly, Ithought drinking ayahuasca, the visionary medicine from the Amazon basin, wouldbe extremely beneficial for many of them. In Big Sur, I attended one of the mostlavish weddings of our transhuman times, as the guest of Sean Parker, co-founderof Napster and the ex-president of Facebook. The roster of invitees includednumerous rock stars and dotcom tycoons, founders and funders of Internetleviathans. Like almost all of them, I wore an outfit custom-made for theoccasion, a long tailored jacket and silk-embroidered vest. We partied all nightin a grove of majestic redwoods, transformed into a Hollywood phantasmagoria ofRenaissance ruins and flower gardens for one multi-million-dollar night. Theceremony set world records for excess, triggering incensed editorials and localoutcries. The wedding was easy to criticize. On the one hand, I found it abeautiful expression of love. On the other, it was a painful reminder that atiny elite gets to enjoy the most fabulous Gatsby-like extravagance, whilebillions around the world remain stuck in poverty and desperation.For Summit Outside, a weekend retreat, I visited a mountaintop in Utah. A groupof young entrepreneurs had bought the entire mountain – a sky resort – to builda utopian community for the privileged, taking a page from the libertarianfantasies of Ayn Rand. We dined on one long table crossing an entire valley. Abattalion of waiters served over a thousand of our society’s best and brightest,a well-meaning, khaki-tinged mob that included heads of charities, venturecapitalists, documentary filmmakers and CEOs of tech start-ups.On a private beach in Mexico, for the end of the Mayan calendar’s5,125-year-long count, costumed dancers in Aztec headdresses gyrated toelectronic beats among life-size reconstructions of Stonehenge, Easter Island’smassive heads and monumental sculptures of Greek deities. I spent the nighttripping with one of the world’s wealthiest art dealers, a Brit. He offered mefree career advice, telling me I should ‘be the messiah, play the pariah’. Backhome, following his lead, I wrote him a long, histrionically irate email linkingthe planetary mega-crisis to the decadence of the art world. He never replied.I write this having just returned from New Zealand where I attended a futuristconference organized by two tech geniuses in their early thirties, who droppedout of Harvard ten years ago to build a massive data-processing company, whichthey sold for a fortune. With the proceeds, they acquired 2,000 acres of Kiwiforests and dairy farms. They are integrating the most up-to-date methods oforganic agriculture, food forestry and solar-powered villages, assembling adream team of yogis, reiki healers, permaculture designers and softwareengineers. They chose New Zealand, after surveying the options, as the mostlikely place in the world to survive runaway climate change, global socialbreakdown and everything else that’s coming. They may be the smartest people Iknow.The Day of the DeadLet’s get back to Sandy: the day after New York was humbled by the super-storm,I biked back to my apartment. Below 28th Street, the city was plunged into avelvety darkness, unlike anything I had experienced. A few bars had stayed open,illuminated by candlelight. Some blocks were so dark that when people passed me,all I could see of them was the reflective strip on their sneakers, caught inbike light for a flickering instant. It was like the darkness of the void –before the beginning, after the end. There was a thrilling ambience oflawlessness – no thief would ever be caught in the depths of that blackness.My building had a dank, foetid smell. The flood had engulfed the already mouldybasement. My apartment was without heat or cell phone service. I threw everyblanket over me and shivered through the cold night. Early the next morning, Iwas picked up by a chauffeurdriven SUV. The car gathered up a small group offashionable Burners – photographers, event planners, stylists. We headed out oftown to a small nearby airport.I had never flown on a private jet before. To my surprise, there were nosecurity checks before boarding. We didn’t need to remove our shoes, get bombedby malevolent millimetre waves, or throw away forbidden tubes of lotion andcanisters of hairspray. Any one of us could have been carrying an assault riflestrapped across our chest and a suitcase nuke. Nobody would have checked. Thiswas a gentle reminder that our world works a bit differently for thesuper-wealthy compared to everyone else. According to the net, the owner of theplane was worth close to a billion. He owned boats, private islands, as well astequila companies and jets. Of course, he also contributed to many charities.They all do.In a world plagued by so much unnecessary suffering, we might consider extremewealth – and the entitlement and insulation it brings – a spiritual disease.Most of us are prey to outbreaks of it, on much smaller scales. I admit – inthis regard and many others – I am no better than most.When I was in my twenties, I got my first good-paying job as an editor at amagazine – a crass competitor to Vanity Fair, called Fame. Suddenly, with moneyin the bank, I felt far less sympathetic and compassionate than I had when I waspoor. Where previously I would give money to homeless people, now I would scoffwhen, wearing my new double-breasted Armani suit, I walked past them sprawledout on the sidewalk. I wondered why they couldn’t pick themselves up off theground and find a career.Now for a far more embarrassing admission. Just a few years ago, I received asizable grant from a foundation. When I had an influx of funding, after years offeeling grumpy and cash-starved, I sought to redress what I saw as old wrongs. Ifelt I ‘deserved’ a taste of the luxury lifestyle enjoyed by my many wealthyfriends with their endless skiing vacations, boating trips and spa treatments.Instead of using every penny to fuel the social and cultural revolution Ibelieve is necessary, I upped my lifestyle in various ways – fancier suits,better restaurants, a trip or two. I felt it was my due.In some ways, it is easier to be poor. One has less choice and lessresponsibility. I am sure, at the mogul’s level of wealth, there is powerfulpeer pressure, among CEOs, to throw the best party, buy the coolest island orvintage car collection or whatever. Sitting on the private plane to Mexico in2012, I wished I could find a way to speak to my host, to convey to him thepressing needs of our moment – what might happen if his genius for buildingcompanies could be channelled, used to liberate the masses from the mentalprison the media has built around the human mind. But I could tell my viewswould mean nothing to him.We landed. I dropped my bag in my hotel, then wandered through themustard-coloured streets of the colonial town, appreciating its baroque facadesand vibrant street life. A massive stone cathedral presided over the elegantcentral square. Locals, as well as expats, were costumed as skeletal phantasms.They wore tuxedos, evening gowns, white gloves. Delicate traceries of black inkdecorated their bleached faces. Altars made of flowers, papier-mâché tombstonesand giant sculpted skulls were set up all around town.This extreme journey – from Hurricane Sandy’s urban wipe-out to the private jetto the elegant ghost world of the Day of the Dead – seemed a garish presentimentof what humanity may be rapidly approaching: an abrupt passage between worlds.It was just one year after the end of the 13th Baktun, completing the Mayancalendar’s long count, the focus of my second book.It could be the case that the ‘dimensional shift’ that many mystics speak about,which the visionary philosopher Rudolf Steiner described as differentincarnations of the Earth, and which indigenous cultures like the Hopi call atransition from one ‘world’ to the next, requires our total annihilation. Afterall, even for those of us who believe in great mysteries and subtle realms, wereally know nothing about the workings of the invisible, occult dimensions.Death remains the biggest question mark. Maybe we all need to croak together, inone massive methane eruption, biospheric cataclysm or Dr Strangelovian plungeinto nuclear winter, to work our stuff out on the astral plane.Hurricane Sandy had revealed vividly to me the fragility of our instruments andour dependence on the grid. If the blackout had gone on past a few days, the bowand arrow would have seemed futuristic.After Sandy, city agencies and volunteers from the Occupy movement bandedtogether to rebuild those sections of the city that the storm had decimated,like Rockaway Beach and Red Hook. This was a noble effort. But it also seemed adoomed one. All of the evidence tells us climate change is intensifying. Whyrestore beachfronts and barrier islands if they will soon be abandoned in anycase?What Happens Next?When it comes to the future, we appear to suffer from a severe lack ofdirection. Collectively, we are lost, fumbling in the dark. How can it be thatwe have so little idea of where we are going – or want to go – as a species?Perhaps people believe there are experts taking care of the problem – but whatif the experts turn out to be self-deluded in various intricate ways? What ifthere are no experts, as of now, in what the future can bring?And yet, we can say a few things about the future with a fair degree ofcertainty. By 2050, without some drastic, as of yet unimaginable intervention –without a radical, globally orchestrated programme to reduce CO2 levels throughconservation and sequestration – the Earth will be considerably hotter than itis today. With climate change quickening now, by then the planet could be two,three or more degrees warmer. Accelerated warming might cause three metres, atleast, of sealevel rise, according to climate scientists. This would havedisastrous impacts.Let’s admit what we all know. We are already experiencing crazy, rapidlyfluctuating weather. As I write this, New York is colder in May than it was inJanuary. In a few decades, the situation could be far more chaotic than we caneven predict. We depend on plants to provide us with sustenance. In order toblossom and grow – to feed us, in other words – they need climate stability.The Arctic is melting rapidly now; month by month, gigatons of ice are releasedinto the seas. Many of the world’s low-lying coastal cities – including New YorkCity, my home – could be deluged, made uninhabitable within a handful ofdecades. If that happens, hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people willstart migrating inland in either a somewhat controlled or chaotic fashion.Let’s assume the current political system finds a way to stay in place despitepanics and paroxysms. In that case, a tiny elite will still maintain controlover the vast preponderance of the world’s wealth and property. They will employprivate armies, killer drones and government surveillance to guard and protecttheir privileged status in a disintegrating world – if they haven’t found a moreinsidious method, like hacking the brainstems of their serfs or developing thenext tier of mood- and mind-altering drugs to control the nervous systems of thesheeple directly.It is inevitable that the melting of the mountaintop glaciers that provide freshwater to several billion people, and other drastic changes in climate andweather patterns, will induce unending droughts. Famines could be endemic acrossmuch of the world. With these cataclysms, along with spreading diseases, wemight undergo significant, if not severe, population die-offs. These conditions,in all likelihood, will lead to regional wars over resources, the scapegoatingand persecuting of minorities, as well as the collapse of many nation-states.Industrial disasters like Fukushima and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill will becomeregular occurrences in the wake of tsunamis and superstorms. All the big catsand great apes will go extinct, and mosquitoes and insect pests will migratenorth. Seeking escape from physical hell, the masses may zone out on immersivegames and virtual reality spectacles. As the world turns into a giant refugeecamp, engineers will experiment with massive geo-engineering schemes. They willpour sulphur particles into the atmosphere and iron filings into the oceans withunpredictable, perhaps even more disastrous consequences.This scenario is, of course, only an outline, with many X factors. Perhapsadvances in medicine and nanotechnology will bring life extension and superhumancapacities to the privileged few, creating a deeper biological divide betweenthe Haves and Have Nots. Populist fury may erupt against the First World – theprimary source of economic injustice and ecological decimation – as the Earthbecomes hotter, more crowded and more barren of life. This could lead to thedetonation of ‘suitcase nukes’ in major cities and bioterrorism or false flagevents involving weaponized or genetically engineered viruses.Mass panic would force a descent into martial law. People may be electronicallytagged, their every move under the surveillance of sophisticated artificialintelligence agents. This would be a hotter, drearier, more despicable world –but one that seems quite likely, from where we are now.Another scenario is plausible and far more extreme. Soon – any time now – we mayface runaway climate change – rapid warming, beyond the worst predictions. Overthe last decade, scientists found that positive feedback loops acceleratewarming. For instance, the disappearance of Arctic ice means that more sunlightis absorbed and less is reflected, turning up the thermostat.One way this can happen is through an eruption of methane. Methane is roughly 30times more potent as a heat-trapping gas than CO2. While methane only stays inthe atmosphere for ten years, whereas CO2 circulates for over a century, thereare huge quantities of it frozen in the oceans and the Siberian peat bogs.Scientists believe a sudden eruption of methane caused the Permian MassExtinction 250 million years ago, when 95 per cent of all life on Earth wentextinct within a few decades.From the study of past geological epochs, we know that once warming passes anunknown tipping point, the Earth can heat rapidly, becoming a biological desertin a half-century. Through studying the climate record, preserved in ice-coresamples, geologists have learned that the climate generally doesn’t make a slow,incremental transition from one steady state to another. Instead, it tends tomake a drastic lurch in a short timeframe.When you take the time to study the ecological data, you can feel as though youare on a bad acid trip, in danger of losing your moorings as well as your mind.The situation can seem irrevocably, almost absurdly grim. Even so, I believethere are many good reasons to hope. The human species is creative, innovative,highly adaptive. We can change quickly. We might be on the cusp of a rapidtransmutation now. Because we are meshed together into one global brain via theInternet, new ideas, new ecological techniques – even new currencies or ways topractise democracy – can spread across the world in a micro-millisecond.Although a tremendous amount of damage has already occurred, and more isunavoidable, it is still possible that we can rally ourselves. We can redirectour civilization along a different path and we can do it quickly. As PeakEverything author Richard Heinberg notes, ‘In order to save ourselves, we do notneed to evolve new organs; we just need to change our culture. Andlanguage-based culture can change very swiftly, as the industrial revolution hasshown.’Similarly, Alexis Zeigler writes in Culture Change, ‘The solution to changingthe Western lifestyle is the simple impossible act of creating social networksthat build social support outside of the mainstream in the context of a trulysustainable society.’ If we haven’t accomplished this yet, it may be because wehaven’t really tried.PsiMaterially, we can shift global practices in farming, industry and energyproduction within a few decades. We can reforest the planet. This would put amassive amount of excess carbon back in the Earth. But along with the material,industrial aspects of this transition, we will need to undergo a shift in ourvalues, beliefs and habits. In other words, we need to change our technical andindustrial base, our political and economic system, as well as our consciousnessand our culture – our way of relating to the world. I know this is no smallfeat, but it is possible. It could occur through a tipping point, where a smallgroup discovers a new way of being that quickly spreads out to encompass thewhole. And it could happen fast.Also, from my perspective – as we will explore – there are reasons to hope thatfall far outside what mainstream thinkers, scientists or our academies imaginepossible. There are aspects of reality that remain unknown, inaccessible, tomost people. For instance, there is a great deal of evidence that we possesslatent psychic abilities, which some researchers call Psi.Psi could be exponentially more powerful as a transformative force thanelectricity, if we can figure out how to use it. ‘Psi is a terribly importantadventure. It is the wild card in our seemingly hopeless attempt to get thehuman race off the endangered species list,’ writes Lawrence LeShan in A NewScience of the Paranormal. ‘We must be open to facing the possibility that wewill find things so new and startling that they change our preconceptions aboutourselves and about the universe we live in,’ he writes. ‘So far, we have nothad that courage. Perhaps now with species extinction looming before us, we willfind that courage.’ I consider it possible that the ecological crisis could be a‘cosmic trigger’, forcing not only rapid technological and social innovation,but also a psychic evolution.ProphecyIn 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, my last book, I explored the thesis thathumanity is undergoing an evolutionary leap from one level of consciousness –one state of being – to the next. Although I dealt with the 5,125-year-longcount cycle of the Mayan calendar, which ended on 21 December 2012, I neveranticipated either the Apocalypse or Rapture at or around that date.I proposed instead that the purpose of the calendar was to mark the transition –to help us make the jump. I saw the end of the long count as an invitation forhumanity to undergo a global awakening and take a different path. This wouldmean adopting aspects of the worldview and some of the practices of indigenousand aboriginal cultures.These small-scale, traditional societies developed methods of longtermcontinuity based on their spiritual ethos of interdependence and connection tonature. As Native American sociologist Jack Forbes puts it, ‘The life of NativeAmerican peoples revolves around the concept of the sacredness, beauty, powerand relatedness of all forms of existence. In short, the ethics or moral valuesof native people are part and parcel of their cosmology or total worldview.’ Wecan, I think, merge crucial aspects of the indigenous worldview – as well as theecological and social practices that stem from it – with our advanced technicalcapacities. If we manage this, we can learn to respect the limits of the Earthand bring our global civilization back into balance.In the modern world, time is linear and spatial – you can waste it, run out ofit or equate it with money. We are supposed to be making ‘progress’ towards someineffable, technological goal. But this is just one way of conceiving time, ofexploring its many dimensions. There is also the dreamtime, the ever-presentorigin, known to aboriginals.Aboriginals don’t conceive of history, of progress and redemption, or declineand fall. For them, the universe is a sacred continuum, an ongoing ceremony.There is only one holy moment, infinitely extended. This way of understandingtime is at least as sensible as ours.In the modern world, people tend to think of humanity as separate from nature –somehow above or outside of it. We forget that all of our abilities areextensions of what we have received from the natural world. I think this givesus reason to hope. The development of modern industrial civilization may also bepart of a natural cycle. Most probably, the evolution of society – thedevelopment of consciousness – is as exquisitely timed and purposeful as otherprocesses we observe in evolutionary biology. We may be following a programme orsequence – much like foetal development, where the mother transmits chemicalsignals to her infant, at precise intervals, up to the moment of birth. How weunderstand and articulate it is part of the programme, executed by the code asit writes itself.Right now, I believe we are in transition – in the birth canal – approaching thenext threshold of our awakening, the next phase of our life as a species. Inquantum physics, for example, we are realizing the union of Western science withEastern metaphysics. In the Middle Ages, modern science emerged out of magic andalchemy. Science began with observation of the physical phenomena we observedoutside of us. It has slowly turned inwards. Mysticism starts from the otherdirection. It begins with our subjective experience – the phenomenology ofperception – and opens to the world in its totality. As we approach the end ofhistory, the edge of the abyss, these forms of knowledge are fusing together,merging and unifying. I consider this to be part of the prophetic shift we areundergoing.The world – according to Hinduism and Buddhism, is ‘maya’, illusion. Similarly,Carl Jung saw the world as a projection of the psyche, a parable of theimagination. I take this to be true, to the deepest level. The imagination isnot just a faculty. William Blake considered it to be human existence itself. Weare living a fable devised by one underlying source, pure consciousness – the ‘IAm That’, which we are. When we deepen our consciousness – when we ratchet upour awareness of unity within multiplicity – the world shifts correspondingly.We can no longer allow ourselves to be carried along by the forces of history.Humanity has reached a juncture where, in order to survive, we must becomeco-creative with the evolutionary process, inflecting and shaping it. We cantake responsibility for the plot, its twists and dizzying turns. This requires anew vision and shaping intention.I don’t think everyone needs to drink ayahuasca, go to Burning Man, or explorethe prophetic or esoteric aspects of reality. There are many different pathwaysto self-knowledge and happiness. I also believe that it makes no sense toseparate out the ‘spiritual’ and the ‘material’ – or the spiritual and thepolitical – as if they are opposites. That is a flaw in our thinking that weinherited from outmoded religions. The separation between spirituality andmatter was absorbed into New Age spirituality, which has often beenself-centred. Now we must grow beyond it to make a spiritual commitment to ourhuman family, as a whole, as well as to the greater community of life on Earth.It is hard to imagine how we can make a rapid systemic transition without a massawakening or a consciousness revolution. As unlikely and implausible as itseems, we need to transform the basis of our post-industrial, ecologicallysuicidal, hyper-individualist, deeply unjust society. We can establish, in itsplace, a system that supports the collective health of humanity as it restoresand replenishes the biosphere. Considering the severity of our biosphericemergency, we must find technical as well as social solutions that can replicatequickly and scale exponentially. If it helps to focus our minds on thealternative, we can call it a regenerative society.Sustainability, the ability to maintain life in its current form over a longduration, needs to be eclipsed by a new paradigm. As a call to action, whatsustainability seeks to sustain, above all, is some version of our current wayof life, even though the evidence is quite overwhelming that it cannot continue.Living processes, generally, don’t just endure or persevere. Life eitherflourishes and blooms, evolves and transforms, or it stagnates and dies. Therhetoric of sustainability tends to support the belief that our current form ofpost-industrial capitalism can be reformed – that it can persist, in somethingclose to its present order.The emergent paradigm defines its ideal as a regenerative culture. We can lookat our current institutions and ideologies as a substrate, a foundation,providing the conditions for another level of transformation, just as modernbourgeois society, based on market relations and competition, emerged frommonarchy, based on feudalism and obligation. According to chaos theory, thenonlinear dynamics of living organisms allow for the emergence of new orders ofcomplexity, when a system reaches a high level of instability. As themono-cultural, technocratic approach of post-industrial capitalism crumbles, anew worldview – a new way of being – is crystallizing.To understand what I mean by a regenerative society, we can contrast it with theconsumerist society we have now. In a consumer society, the main focus ofcultural and industrial production is making and selling consumer goods to thosewho can afford them. Industry creates profit for corporations and shareholders.A regenerative society, in contrast, would apply technology and industry torestore and replenish the ecosystems of the planet, while also seeking toenhance the quality of people’s lives. The focus would not be on accumulatingwealth for the few, but on distributing goods and resources fairly. The goal ofsuch a system is a world where humanity thrives, living in harmony and symbiosiswith the planet. This requires a greater emphasis on resilient local communitiesand bioregions, rather than global corporations and nation-states.Rebellion and the SacredAlbert Camus – chic existentialist, renowned hipster intellectual of his time –saw rebellion as a metaphysical principle. When men rebel, they overcome theirindividuality and alienation. They identify themselves with all those who sufferunder oppression. In The Rebel, he wrote, ‘only two possible worlds can existfor the human mind: the sacred (or to speak in Christian terms, the world ofgrace) and the world of rebellion. The disappearance of one is equivalent to theappearance of the other, despite the fact that this appearance can take place indisconcerting forms.’Modern civilization represents rebellion from the past. We rebelled against anyidea of God or the sacred, declaring, with Nietzsche, ‘the death of God’. Is itpossible we are leaving the time of rebellion behind us? Has nihilism,hyper-individualism, domination, patriarchy, run its course? Are we finallylosing interest in our own extended tantrum? Is the pendulum swinging back fromthe world of rebellion to the world of the sacred? Personally, I believe this isour evolutionary destiny.Since the 1960s, consumer society has diluted the pursuit of enlightenment intoa lifestyle option, as meaningless as all the rest. People seek enlightenment atweekend workshops, or by mantra chanting twice a day, while they pursue careersin corporate finance or advertising. Mindfulness is taught to project managersat Google to boost their efficiency.Spirituality has become trendy; shamanism is a fad. For the post- Marxist criticSlavoj Žižek, Westernized Buddhism, as well as yoga and urban shamanism,‘enables you to fully participate in the frantic pace of the capitalist game,while sustaining the perception that you are not really in it, that you are wellaware how worthless this spectacle really is – what really matters to you is thepeace of the inner self to which you know you can always withdraw . . .’ Žižekproposes that ‘New Age “Asiatic” thought’ – reflected in bestsellers like ThePower of Now, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success and The Secret – has become‘the hegemonic ideology of global capitalism’. I find this a helpful insight.The elite of our society – mainly Baby Boomers now – tend to indulge in afeel-good, Diet Coke version of spirituality, without sacrifice or commitment.They nibble at the edges of mysticism, toying with The Four Agreements,mastering The Seven Laws of Spiritual Success, flying to Hawaii for weekendTantra workshops designed to enhance their orgasms. They scrupulously avoid thesurrendering of ego meant to accompany enlightenment, as well as its political,social and ecological dimensions.But right now we need to wake up for real. We must wake up – not becausespirituality makes us feel good, or chanting a mantra gets us a new car, orbecause avowing Advaita Vedanta non-duality assuages our guilt at not doingenough for the world. We need to wake up because the Arctic was 30 degreesCelsius warmer than usual in the winter of 2015. We are polluting everyecosystem on the planet. Somehow, we have to overcome distractions to confrontthe destruction we have unleashed on the world – and hopefully reverse it. Atthis point, our planet’s future – the lives of our children and all children –depends on us, on our passion, commitment and critical discernment; on how wemake use of our limited time and resources.We must overcome self-interest to see ourselves in a new way. Our species canevolve to play a supportive role in the Earth’s ecology: that’s our opportunity.As individuals, we can see ourselves as secret agents or midwives, helping tobirth a new human society. We can be catalysts who create change with our wordsand our deeds. As part of this initiation the cosmos has delivered to us, I amafraid we must be willing to make serious short-term sacrifices.I meet many well-off people who are constantly trying to heal themselves. Whilehealing ourselves is important, it can also become a trap. Instead of waitingfor some magical healing to occur, the most advanced and aware among us need tolead by example – to take courageous risks, pointing the way forward foreveryone else. Perhaps we can only truly be healed when we overcome our sense ofentitlement by embracing a new collective mission, acting together as one.Multitudes of people are getting angry and desperate. As the old world collapsesaround them, they will turn to Trump-like demagogues, choose hatred and pursueshort-sighted goals that will further damage the Earth. These people need to beshown another path, but we can only do so once we have found it ourselves. Atthis point, we need more than a vague idea of the alternative – we can’t justhold hands together and sing ‘Imagine’, waiting for a more beautiful worldspontaneously to emerge. We have to understand what’s wrong with our systemwhile we work on building the tangible alternatives. We should demand a worldthat works for everyone – including the most desperate, marginalized anddeprived people.We all know, in our hearts, that liberation – authentic illumination – requiresa Christ-like dedication to service. Buddhists take the Bodhisattva vow – theycommit to awaken all sentient beings, out of compassion, through innumerablecycles of death and rebirth. What does this mean for us? We must find a way toembody, to express, our solidarity with the sorrowing Earth.If we are aspects of that one being – the eternal principle, the Absolute, theVoid, the Creator Spirit, the Artist formerly known as God – then the originalrevelations of Christianity shine in a new light: I and the Father are one. Loveyour neighbour as yourself. If there is only one non-local source – oneconsciousness, infinitely variable and indivisibly the same – then allseparation is illusion: we are one.Gandhi and Martin Luther King remain intimidating figures because of the waythey lived their values and ideals. For Martin Luther King, ‘The Kingdom of God’existed now, not in some imaginary future. The Kingdom comes into being wheneverwe unite our ideals with our actions. Gandhi built a mass movement of nonviolentactivism based on principles of satyagraha, or ‘truth force’. He overthrewBritish colonial rule in India based on this principle: ‘The followers of truthand nonviolence will offer satyagraha against tyranny and win over the tyrant bylove, he will not carry out the tyrant’s will but he will suffer punishment evenunto death for disobeying his will until the tyrant himself is won over.’Gandhi’s thought is so unadorned, so pure, it is still shocking to encounter it.We have unleashed planetary catastrophe through our actions as a species. Wehave induced an initiatory crisis for humanity as a whole. I think that on asubconscious level we have willed this into being. We are forcing ourselves toevolve – to change or die – by creating this universal threat to our existence.We will either squander our chance and fail as a species, or we will seize it,making a voluntary, self-willed mutation in how we think and act. This is thechoice that faces us now."},{"pageContent":"2ECSTATIC CONTACT WITH THE COSMOSWhen I was a child, I remember feeling certain that a great secret was waitingto be revealed to me. I felt the whole world trembling with this mystery thatlurked behind the surface of ordinary reality. It was hidden under the sidewalksof New York City, within the windows of the apartment buildings that stared outat me like ten thousand unblinking eyes. It was whispered by the wind that blewteasingly through the leaves of the trees, causing ripples across the Hudson.I was sure this mystery waiting to unveil itself to me was the core ofexistence. When I found it, I would know my purpose and mission and become awhole being. I assumed all adults had passed through the portal of thisunfathomable event. I believed this must be the secret subtext of theirconversations, which otherwise seemed nonsensically dull and boring.In high school, I began to grasp, then to accept morosely, that no hiddenrevelation awaited me or anybody else. It slowly dawned on me that the adults Iknew did not have access to anything beyond the ordinary and day-to-day. I feltbaffled, betrayed, by this realization.I think many of us can recall the anticipation, the expectancy, that the worldwas designed to reveal a great secret. We can also recall the sense of despairwe felt when our hope was extinguished.The yearning we feel as adolescents, when all of our senses strain for somedeeper intensity of being, is the desire for initiation and transcendence. Weseek access to something sacred – something greater than ourselves. Because ourculture denies us the fulfilment of this yearning, we become alienated andjaded. Over time, we learn to accept our disappointment, to forget our hopes. Weare forced to accept degraded substitutes – to find a limited form oftranscendence in media spectacles, sporting contests and artworks.I believe modern civilization is founded on this original betrayal. Alltraditional societies around the world – all premodern cultures – had some formof rites of passage, of initiations, which marked the transition from childhoodto maturity. At some long-ago point in our history, Judaeo-Christiancivilization abandoned the techniques of initiation, which allowed each personto reach self-knowledge or gnosis, in favour of indoctrination. Spiritualknowledge was no longer available to everyone. It was controlled, held insecrecy, by the priests and the rulers.This history can be traced back to the closing of the Mystery Schools that werecrucial institutions up until the rise of Christianity. All of the great figuresof antiquity congregated annually at Eleusis in Ancient Greece, where theyimbibed a potion together, the kykeon, which most probably contained psychedelicplants. In the Middle Ages, the Church stamped out the European remnants ofplant shamanism with the Inquisition, where those who possessed second sight,who used substances like belladonna and henbane to undertake visionary flights,were burnt at the stake as witches.A civilization developed that promoted only one kind of consciousness – arational, day-lit form of awareness, denigrating the intuitive, the visionaryand the mystical. These forms of holistic rightbrain awareness can also beconsidered feminine. Modern civilization not only repressed women and demonizedfemale sexuality; it also suppressed the feminine, intuitive aspects ofconsciousness. It only considered the left-brain or masculine aspect to bevaluable. As this patriarchal civilization developed science, logic and militarydiscipline, it was able to extend its reach across the world, constructing aglobal empire.Because it is innate to us, the yearning for transcendence and initiation alwaysreappears in some form. If it is not integrated into the culture in a healthyand useful way, it expresses itself through nightmarish deviations. Writingbetween the First and Second World Wars, the German Jewish critic WalterBenjamin thought that humanity could not avoid collective experiences where weenter into ‘ecstatic contact with the cosmos’. Either we create such ceremoniesconsciously, or they will be inflicted upon us through catastrophes. Benjaminsaw the First World War as an example of this. It was an ‘attempt at a new andunprecedented mingling with the cosmic powers’, unleashing gargantuan powers ofdeath and destruction.Today, we see our innate human yearning for transcendence displaced ontotechnology. In Silicon Valley, the Singularity has become a quasi-religiousfaith supporting the ideology of corporate progress. The idea of the Singularityis that humanity’s destiny is to merge with our machines or be replaced by thementirely. As I will discuss in more depth later, I think this is a wrongdirection. I don’t believe we should reject technology. I believe our evolutionof technology is part of the evolution of consciousness. But we should seek tomaster our mechanical and virtual tools for humane, regenerative purposes.The world wars that defined the twentieth century could be seen as expressionsof the suppressed, primitive parts of our collective psychology – what Carl Jungcalled the shadow – projected on a massive scale. They reflected the level ofunconsciousness existing at that time. In the same way, I believe we haveunconsciously unleashed the ecological mega-crisis in order to force acollective awakening and to bring about the next level of our unfolding as aspecies.Our governing elites and educated classes have known for over a half-centurythat we are charging towards ecological collapse. Abundant data, the Club ofRome reports, books like Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring made this clear decadesago. But we have been unable to change our direction and, in fact, we havecontinued to accelerate towards disaster. Underlying the momentum ofpost-industrial civilization is a deep well of suppressed grief over our assaulton the biosphere. This also must be brought into our awareness, andacknowledged.We see the same pattern occurring in ourselves and in the lives of the peoplearound us. People will persist in addictive and self-destructive patterns untilthey find themselves forced to choose between a path of self-knowledge ordisintegration and death. On a neurological level, they seek to push themselvesto the limit, pursuing different states of consciousness – seeking someintensity of communion that the normal world has denied them.Collectively, the human species is revealing the same pattern ofself-destructive impulsion – suppressed yearning leading to heedless abandon –that we see on the individual level. We are pushing against the boundaries ofego-based individualism, seeking to reach the next expression of our humanbeing-ness. In order to evolve, we have to recognize the pattern.A Collective Rite of PassageWe can conceive of the biospheric meltdown humanity has caused as a rite ofpassage for our species as a whole. Anthropologists have noted that rites ofpassage invariably pass through a series of stages. In the first stage, thecandidates are taken away from their homes. They are forced to undergo a processthat is shrouded in mystery, considered life-threatening as well as sacred.During this stage of separation, they undergo certain ordeals that force theminto an altered state of consciousness, where they receive visions. The eldershelp them to understand and interpret what the spiritual world has revealed tothem. In the final stage of reunion, they are welcomed back into the community,which celebrates their return.Initiations can take many forms. They can involve long fasts, vision quests,solitary walkabouts in the wilderness. Initiation can mean taking psychedelicplants like peyote, iboga, mushrooms or ayahuasca. They vary widely in intensityand duration. One form of initiation, for Australian aboriginals, involves beingburied up to your neck in the earth for one excruciating, interminable night. Inthe tradition of the Kogi people who live in the mountains of Colombia, theyoung boys who are destined to be the Mamas, the teachers of their community andthose who perform divinations, must spend many years in darkness, to developtheir visionary capacities. For an initiation ritual of the Hopi snake clan,poisonous snakes are collected from the wilderness. The members of the clan sitin a circle, with their knees touching. The snakes are dumped out of a sack intothe centre of the circle. The men must remain in absolute stillness until allthe snakes have slithered away, passing over them.Modern civilization maintains faint vestiges of initiation rites in ceremonieslike baptisms and Bar Mitzvahs, or hazing rituals at college fraternities. Forthe most part, these ceremonies are comparatively sedate. They do not forcepeople to risk their lives, undergo personal transformation, face their fear ofdeath and the unknown, or access a visionary trance. A diploma rather than anythreshold of inner realization tells us we have reached adulthood.We seem to be subconsciously impelling ourselves towards planetary catastropheto break our alienation and ego-centrism, to reach a new intensity of communion.We are making this happen through collective catastrophe because we no longerhave rites of passage which create the same effect through intentionally guidedritual. But the chaos and catastrophe we are unleashing may have an unforeseenresult. Collectively, humanity can realize love – universal, unconditional love– as the root of our solidarity, the basis for healing our world. Through ashared experience of catastrophe as well as the witnessing of mass suffering, wemay be forcing ourselves to open our hearts individually and collectively.In A Paradise Built in Hell, Rebecca Solnit visited communities in the wake ofmajor disasters, such as New Orleans after Katrina. We are conditioned by themass media to believe that people will behave like monsters or criminals whensociety breaks down, but Solnit found the opposite. For the most part, people goout of their way to help each other when catastrophe strikes. ‘In the wake of anearthquake, a bombing, or a major storm, most people are altruistic, urgentlyengaged in caring for themselves and those around them, strangers and neighboursas well as friends and loved ones,’ she writes. Years after a disaster, manypeople recall their experiences as the best time of their lives, when theybriefly felt a sense of belonging and togetherness. Ironically, before moderncivilization, this was our natural state, going back tens of thousands of years.‘Disasters, in returning their sufferers to public and collaborative life, undosome of this privatization, which is a slower, subtler disaster all its own,’Solnit writes. ‘In a society in which participation, agency, purposefulness andfreedom are all adequately present, a disaster would be only a disaster.’Our current civilization artificially keeps us alienated and isolated, incompetition with each other. The system functions mechanically to benefit thoseat the top of the financial pyramid, who control humanity through mass media andgovernment, instilling fear and insecurity. We subconsciously strain againstthis condition of slavery and serfdom. We require a breakthrough to a new systemto express the full range of our humanity – our innate altruism, our empathy forone another. The oncoming emergency will force us to access the deep reserves ofintelligence, compassion and creativity that we need to bring about thismetamorphosis.As individuals, we don’t need to wait for catastrophic rupture of our planet’ssupport systems before we shift into an actualized, empathic state. We can makeit our conscious choice; we can live that way now. But tragically, it seems thathumanity, as a collective, requires a universal crisis to bring about our massawakening.The Prefrontal CortexInitiations are more than cultural or social processes. They may have a crucialimpact on how our brain functions. They may be neurological events that have apermanent impact on how we relate to the world.The newest structure in the brain separates us from our primate ancestors. Thisstructure is called the prefrontal cortex and is part of the neocortex. It hasonly reached its current level of complexity over the last 100,000 years –barely a blink of evolutionary time. The prefrontal cortex is an evolutionarymutation that allows for higher-order thought, language and abstract symbolprocessing. As Joseph Chilton Pierce writes in The Biology of Transcendence,this region of the brain governs ‘all higher intellectual capacities such as ourabilities to compute and reason, analyse, think creatively, and so on’. Oursense of self-identity and awareness develops through adolescence, but we mayrequire a culturally induced ordeal – an initiatory shock – to reach our fullpotential.Through extreme events or initiation rituals, the individual can attainvisionary states, overcoming the limits of the ego. This often happens, forinstance, in Near Death Experiences, which can permanently change how thesurvivor sees the world. The visionary or non-ordinary state that brings a senseof unity with the cosmos, or awareness of the multi-dimensions of the psyche,may be very fleeting. Even so, such non-ordinary states of consciousness canprovide a stable reference point, like an anchor, particularly when the societyrecognizes their importance and value.One function of initiation, according to Pierce, is to connect mind and heart.The heart is also a thinking organ, possessing neurons. It emanates a measurablefield of electromagnetism in the shape of a torus that surrounds the physicalbody. Almost universally, Pierce writes,A poignant and passionate idealism arises in early puberty, followed by anequally passionate expectation in the mid-teens that ‘something tremendous issupposed to happen’ and finally by the teenager’s boundless, exuberant belief in‘the hidden greatness within me’. A teenager often gestures toward his or herheart when speaking of these three sensibilities, for the heart is involved inwhat should take place.When society thwarts our innate drive to find meaning and transcendence throughinner experience, the deepest, most sensitive parts of ourselves go numb.With no access to transcendent states, people are trapped by constant cravings,seeking empty gratifications. They try to solidify their sense of personalidentity through material possessions or by seeking power over others. Theycannot reach maturity, which, for a member of a tribe, means takingresponsibility for your community, revering and caring for the natural world,and accepting also the place assigned to you in the cosmic order.My JourneyWhen I was in my late twenties, that suppressed yearning I had felt as anadolescent reappeared in a deeper form. I don’t know why I was afflicted with itto such a degree. All I know is that my life seemed increasingly empty andmeaningless without some way of reaching transcendence. I’d grown up without anyreligious or spiritual beliefs. My parents were artists who had rejected thereligion of their ancestors.My Irish Catholic father, Peter Pinchbeck, painted in the tradition of theAbstract Expressionists. He brooded over huge canvases in his bare SoHo loft. MyJewish mother, Joyce Johnson, belonged to the Beat Generation as a young womanin the 1950s. She wrote about her relationship with the novelist Jack Kerouacand her adolescence in her memoir, Minor Characters.Art was their replacement for religion. It was their life and their faith. Fromchildhood, I wanted to be a poet and novelist. I imagined myself, eventually,writing novels in the tradition of the European avant-garde, following in thefootsteps of Virginia Woolf, Kafka, Samuel Beckett, Nabokov, Georges Perec andother authors that I loved.I was influenced by the Beat writers, particularly Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg andWilliam Burroughs. These authors confronted their own existential crises asyoung men, hovering around Columbia University in the 1940s. The Beats flittedin and out of mental institutions and prisons, exploring the edges andunderworlds. Fighting against the mainstream culture, its stereotypes andhypocrisies, they sought knowledge through direct experience. They exploredpsychedelics and other ways to reach what the poet Arthur Rimbaud called a‘systematic derangement of the senses’.In the late 1940s, Kerouac conceived of the Beat Generation as a ‘subterraneanrevolution’ outside of politics, growing up under the shadow of the atomic bomb,seeking to build a new society based on ‘apocalyptic love’ and the rediscoveryof joy in a liberated society, free of guilt. They rejected the mainstreamconstruct of an adult maturity based on sexual repression, conventional careersand constricted rationality as false. The goal of the Beats was to break free ofreceived ideas and stale conventions. They wanted to recover originality,spontaneity, mystical truth. They believed everyone could access their innatebrilliance, once they liberated themselves from social conventions. Kerouacwrote, ‘You are a genius all of the time.’I suffered a long illness as a child, an infection of the spine which kept me inhospital for eight months between the ages of 11 and 12. I wore a full body castfor most of that time. In the wake of it, I developed scoliosis. My time in thehospital shaped my consciousness in many ways. I felt like an outsider, exiledfrom my body. I also had to learn to find comfort even in the most painful anddifficult circumstances.I suspect this long childhood illness accidentally left me with unusualabilities and tendencies. I couldn’t forget the hovering nearness of death,which made me want to find some meaning or purpose to life. As a writer, Ideveloped the ability to pursue subjects that were too difficult, abstruse orthreatening for most people to explore in depth. I think I also developed someinner detachment which helped me look at the world from an impersonal,systems-level viewpoint.In my late twenties, as I plunged ever deeper into an existential emergency, Ikept thinking about my handful of psychedelic trips back in college. They werethe most powerful indicators that there might be other aspects of reality –other levels of consciousness – that modern civilization had suppressed orrejected. I went back and took LSD and mushrooms again. These substances seemedto reveal so much.On the one hand, they were deconditioning agents. They made me aware that ourcivilization was an artifice, a consensual hallucination, and that our worldcould be constructed differently. I also experienced closed-eye hallucinations,incredibly intricate geometrical patterns and images that didn’t seem likeanything produced by my mind alone. They seemed to demonstrate the existence ofarchetypal dimensions, the collective field of the psyche that Carl Jungexplored in his work.As I researched psychedelics I learned about the ritual use of ayahuasca inSouth America and iboga in West Africa. As a journalist, I was able to getmagazine assignments to undergo these rituals in their original context. I wentto Gabon, on the equator of West Africa, to eat the iboga root in a ceremonywith the Bwiti tribe. During this all-night event, as I lay on the cool groundin the Bwiti temple, I was taken on a journey through my life up to that time.As I wrote in Breaking Open the Head, I was shown a series of scenes from mypast – they weren’t just visual images. They were like holographic, sensorialrecreations. I recalled myself as a child, with my parents fighting in our loft.I remembered how I made myself terrified that there was a monster hiding underthe bed or in the closet. I remembered how sad I felt when my parents separatedand I moved uptown with my mother.Later, I saw myself in my twenties going to literary cocktail parties andgetting hammered on alcohol. I saw how this drinking had a negative impact on mycharacter, my work and relationships. The scenes appeared again and again, as ifmocking me with my stupidity. I had the uncanny feeling there was a guidingintelligence in the iboga – a plant spirit – that wanted to communicate with me,to teach me.I went to the Amazon jungle in Ecuador to participate in ayahuasca ceremonieswith the Secoya people. The Secoya were a tribe of 30,000 at the beginning ofthe twentieth century. By the time I visited, there were fewer than 700 of themleft, split between two small reservations.Only a few elder shamans remained – tiny, wizened men in their eighties who worecoloured tunics and crowns woven from local branches. The elders walked usthrough the dense jungle, pointing out many plants with healing powers, gigglingfrequently. The oil companies were decimating the jungle, poisoning the riversand building roads. The roads attracted poor mestizos who slashed and burnt theforest to create subsistence farms.Of all the substances I explored, ayahuasca remains my favourite. The substancehas now become popular around the world, with shamans bringing the plants toEurope, Asia, South Africa and everywhere. Ayahuasca is a bitter drink thatrequires two plants, the ayahuasca vine – Banisteriopsis caapi – and theDMT-containing psychotria viridis. The brew induces a huge range of visionaryeffects. You can find yourself immersed in the liquid medium of the aboriginaldreamtime, entering pure consciousness or the samadhi state, or visiting myriadspirits and deities who take you on journeys to other worlds and dimensions.Ayahuasca can also bring you profound, healing insights into the nature of yourown soul.I visited Huautla de Jiménez, a mountain town in Oaxaca, Mexico, where magicmushrooms were found in the early 1950s by the investment banker and amateurmycologist Gordon Wasson, and Valentina, his Russian wife. I explored thepostmodern world of psychedelic chemistry. In Marin County, I visitedgrey-bearded, legendary Sasha Shulgin in his laboratory and tested a number ofhis experimental compounds.I attended an ethnobotany conference in Palenque, Mexico, where I trieddimethyltryptamine, nn-DMT, for the first time. DMT is a chemical produced bythe human brain, and also found in many plants. When I smoked it, my body and mysurroundings vanished. I broke into a fully realized other reality – a kind ofhyper-dimension – that seemed far beyond anything the wiring of my brain couldconcoct. I felt I was communing with a superconsciousness that wasextraterrestrial, overwhelming. I was immersed in a crystalline, fluorescentlattice made up of one being that was simultaneously many beings, all of themchattering at a high pitch. I felt they were omniscient, aware of me as part ofsome programme or of what the science-fiction writer Philip K Dick named a VastAlien Living Intelligence System (VALIS).Breaking Open the Head became a record of my transformation. By following apersonal path of self-discovery, my understanding of the nature of realitychanged profoundly. I started as a secular materialist, a Freudian and sceptic.I ended up converted to a mystical and shamanic worldview. This didn’t happenall at once. It took a series of ceremonies, adventures, good and bad trips, aswell as extensive research through the literature on visionary experience andinterviews with many people who had undergone similar journeys of initiation. Iexperienced inexplicable psychic phenomena: synchronicities, occult apparitions,visitations, telepathic links and much more. These experiences convinced me thatconsciousness is not ultimately brainbased but a fundamental property of theuniverse.BiocentrismReductive scientific materialism is unproven and therefore a kind of religiousfaith. The belief that consciousness is brain-based – an epiphenomenon ofevolution, caused randomly by neurological wiring – remains a hypothesis. Forscientists like Robert Lanza and Amit Goswami, the last decades of experimentsupport the opposite view: consciousness is the underlying reality. The universe– all matter – gives transitory expression to its infinite, ever-changingpotential.In Biocentrism, Lanza notes that space and time have no reality outside of ourawareness of them. They are, finally, ‘tools of our animal understanding’. Hebelieves the universe has been fine-tuned for our emergence and that it existsin order for living beings – we ourselves – to experience and participate in it.Consciousness – the ‘I Am That’ of Eastern mysticism – has devised thisadventure for itself, and we are its expressions.According to quantum physics, the existence of a material world depends on anobserving consciousness, which collapses the incessant quavering of energy wavesinto a definitive, perceivable state. We have also discovered that electrons,once connected, maintain their link no matter how far they travel away from eachother. Time, it would seem, does not exist for these subatomic particles. Thisfact subverts our conventional understanding of time.In The Self-Aware Universe, Goswami, a physicist, theorizes that principles ofquantum theory allow for the existence of subtle bodies and aspects of animmortal soul. What mystics call spirits or souls could be energetic complexesbound together, as quantum waves, via Action at a Distance. Such complexes mayremain connected after the death of an individual.The individual spirit may seek to develop its patterns of thinking, feeling andwilling further through reincarnation, assuming bodily form again and again.Such energy-clusters eventually fulfil their potential, Goswami suggests, whenthey realize their self-identity with the underlying spaceless and timelessreality. This would be what various traditions call enlightenment, illumination,attainment or realization.Both scientists propose that consciousness is primary and precedes materialmanifestation. Goswami believes we must develop a ‘science withinconsciousness’, rather than conceiving an objective reality that exists outsideof it. A great bulk of evidence, as well as repeated experiment, demonstratesthat such an objective reality simply does not exist. Yet, for the most part, wecontinue to act as if it does.Sex and DrugsI am sure some readers will find some of my ideas to be objectionable,dismissible, even absurd. That is okay. We are at a crisis point. We need to bewilling to think differently and consider alternative possibilities, evenradical ones, in all areas. We need to do this simply because the system –industrial, social and ideological – we have inherited is destroying thebiosphere upon which all life depends.What I learned from my own journey is that initiation is not a single thresholdexperience. Even after one accepts the existence of a spiritual world, there aremany levels of initiation and development to undergo. My own development has,unfortunately, been very uneven. Although I accessed some forms of occultknowledge and many new ideas through shamanic work and psychedelic exploration,I was unable to face some flaws in my character for quite a long time.I now believe that prolonged psychedelic use amplified some of my flaws. Somepeople have an innate tendency to push themselves to the edge, seeking to knowwhat lies beyond it. Those are the people who become artists, shamans,visionaries – or criminals, psychopaths or lunatics. We all have thesetendencies to some degree.I published my second book, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, in 2006. The bookbecame a bestseller, and I became an eccentric counterculture celebrity inmiddle age. Driven by urgency about the planetary crisis, I launched companiesand think-tanks before I had reckoned with my own childhood wounds – before Ihad sufficiently seen or integrated my shadow.Suddenly famous, I found I had a great many more sexual opportunities than whenI was young, poor and unknown. A deep well of erotic disappointment anddissatisfaction, even bitterness, had accumulated over the years. I think thisis the sad, suppressed truth for many men. Given the opportunity, I wanted tomake up for lost time. I took advantage of these openings; sometimes, I acted inways that were thoughtless and self-serving, that I now regret. I didn’t realizemy sexual quest had become a nasty compulsion until the pattern revealed itself.What made the situation more complex is that I honestly believed I was promoting‘free love’ in a positive way. I went out of my way to be honest. I thought Iwas following in the footsteps of the poet Allen Ginsberg, who believed thatsociety should support ‘lifestyles of ecstasy, for whoever wants them’. In fact,I still agree with him.Part of my problem was that I still saw myself as a wounded, sensitive person –an underdog – seeking to grow and understand himself. With the success of mywork, other people, particularly younger people in the counterculture world, sawme as a leader or an authority figure. Innately dissident, I wasn’t ready, atthat point in my life, to be anyone’s role model.Personally, I think we need to break away from the nuclear family and themonogamous couple as our ideal. I believe that a liberation of Eros –encompassing love and compassion, as well as sexuality – is a critical aspect ofthe next phase of our evolution as a species. As I will discuss later, thisevolution requires a new level of cooperation between the genders which willbenefit everyone. It also requires deprogramming from inherited patterns ofjealousy and competitiveness, and an eventual transformation of oursocio-economic system.Although I have made many mistakes in my life, I believe my perspective stillhas value – in fact, it probably has more value because of the errors andmissteps. I took some uncharted detours through murky swamps of the psyche,seeking to integrate my personal dark matter. I believe our individual sufferingcan illuminate larger processes happening in the collective. By healingourselves – by understanding the forces that work on us and making peace withthem – we contribute to the healing of the whole. As Nisargadatta Maharaj saysin I Am That: ‘Don’t be afraid, don’t resist, don’t delay. Be what you are.There is nothing to be afraid of. Trust and try. Experiment honestly. Give yourreal being a chance to shape your life. You will not regret.’ I haveexperimented honestly, and I don’t regret.Global RebootThis book is – I admit it – a continuation of my attempt to spark a revolutionat Burning Man over a decade ago. As unsuccessful as that attempt was, as crazyas I am, I still feel I had, in essence, the right idea. I know it is difficultand painful to contemplate what is happening to our world. Most of us areexperts at distracting ourselves from the mega-catastrophe that threatens toengulf all of us, even laughing it off. But if we are brave, I believe we cancome to see it as a necessary and even positive threshold in the life of ourspecies. It is only by embracing this crisis in all of its mind-bendingcomplexity that we can find the will and the incentive to change ourselves andour world.From the 1960s until today, many people have taken personal journeys ofinitiation, rediscovering mysticism and shamanism, and embracing an expandedawareness of psyche and cosmos. This collective voyage of initiation can’t becompleted, however, until those who have taken their personal vision quests areable to bring their new knowledge back into our society – to have it fullyabsorbed, welcomed and integrated. The best option is that we undertake apeaceful, deliberately designed and non-destructive system change.We can think of our current civilization – its technical and sociopoliticalinfrastructure, its ideology and beliefs – as an operating system, much like thesoftware that runs our computers. Now we need to reboot and install a new systemsoftware. A new social design could, eventually, give every human being theopportunity to flourish and thrive, to live creatively, without fear for theirfuture. Accomplishing this is a great mission that will require a trulyrational, empathic application of our technical and creative powers.We must build this new programme – engineer this global reboot – within the nextdecades. If we can accomplish this, we will have passed the test that theuniverse has set for us. I realize that some people will worry I am proposing anefarious form of ‘social engineering’. The truth is that we have already beensocially engineered. As Terence McKenna noted, culture is our operating system.We have been conditioned since birth to accept a system of global control, eliteprivilege and military domination. Identity is, to a great extent, a socialconstruction.‘The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes’,Oscar Wilde wrote. ‘Change is the one quality we can predicate of it. Thesystems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and noton its growth and development.’ I think this is true. It points towards theenormous task as well as the great opportunity confronting us now. The Earthwill not be able to support a global civilization based on hyper-consumerism andhyperindividualism for much longer. Therefore, we must change human nature as itis currently known. We must do this – not only to survive, but also to reach ourfull potential as a species.Our technocratic society uses the mass media as an instrument of mind controland threatens those who dissent or resist with violent reprisals (for example,nonviolent drug offenders seeking to explore their own consciousness facedraconian prison sentences). Through incessant media bombardment and governmentfear-mongering, people are conditioned to believe that oppression, injustice,violence and inequality are normal and inevitable. What we require is a newsocial design to liberate humanity from its prison. This redesign must alsoreckon with our darker and more destructive impulses and find ways to channelthem.My mission with this book is unabashedly utopian. To quote Wilde again (althoughremembered mainly as a playwright and dandy, he was also a brilliant socialcritic): ‘A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth evenglancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is alwayslanding. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a bettercountry, sets sail. Progress is the realization of Utopias.’Postmodern civilization is already a pseudo-utopia. Over the last few centuries,we have constructed an artificial paradise of consumer goods – the society ofthe spectacle – for those with the resources to enjoy it. Unfortunately, thisartificial paradise is built on excessive waste and ecological destruction. Ithas created misery for those on the margins, the victims of famines, wars andgenocides. By addressing its flaws, we can realize the next manifestation of ourgenius as a species – and achieve, in comparison, a true utopia.I know it seems strange to discuss the imminent prospect of ecological meltdownon the one hand and the attainment of a practical utopia on the other. But suchis the schizophrenic nature of our time. As we shall see, both outcomes seemplausible. In the near term, we may get a bizarre mix of the two.I don’t think a massive dieback of the human population is inevitable – perhapsI refuse to believe it. But the longer we wait to relaunch our social operatingsystem, the more difficult it will be to avert planetary catastrophe. We havealready waited too long.I seek to bring together the archaic and the postmodern, the visionary and therational, the corporate and the anarchistic, in a viable synthesis. I don’texpect us to revert to old-fashioned eighteenthcentury agrarianism, although Ido think communities will need to grow more of their own food and become asself-sufficient as possible. I also don’t think we can regress all the way backto small-scale bands of hunter-gatherers, although there is a great amount weneed to learn from indigenous and aboriginal cultures that supported their localecology for thousands of years. Out of compassion, we must seek to maintain thecurrent human population even as we radically reduce our burden on the Earth.I don’t reject the potential of futuristic technologies – artificialintelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology and so on – out of hand. But I thinkwe must explore them with great caution, and with constant oversight from civilsociety. Right now, crucial decisions that impact on the biosphere in itsentirety are left to engineers, corporations and financiers. Our current form ofgovernment was established in the late eighteenth century, when news as well asprogress moved at a much slower speed than today. To deal with our rapidlychanging circumstances, we need more than a reform – we need, I think, a newpolitical-economic operating system.In many cases, the promise of advanced technologies has been far greater thanwhat they delivered. Each new level of technology also brings with it unforeseennegative consequences, requiring more innovation to fix. As the dark ecologistPaul Kingsnorth has noted, this has created an increasingly alarming, evenworld-endangering ‘progress trap’. As our civilization becomes moretechnologically complex, it also becomes more fragile. The prospect of theSingularity, promulgated by Google engineer Ray Kurzweil and othertechno-utopians, is one we must investigate carefully. It is something like aticking time bomb we must defuse.Competition to CooperationThe study of biological evolution – the history of life on Earth – reveals aninveterate tendency towards greater levels of cooperation, coordination andsymbiosis. This idea may seem surprising at first. As part of the paradigm weinherited – the one we are now leaving behind – many thinkers and scientistsplaced their focus, instead, on the competitive, aggressive and destructiveaspects of nature. This view of biology as a constant struggle for life meshedperfectly with the predatory economic mode of capitalism. This idea has now beensuperseded by a new view of life as an intricately networked phenomenon, whereorganisms support each other far more than they compete.According to biologist Lynn Margulis, the author of Microcosmos, who developedthe Gaia hypothesis with scientist James Lovelock, ‘The trip from greedygluttony, from instant satisfaction to long-term mutualism, has been made manytimes in the microcosm. While destructive species may come and go, cooperationitself increases through time.’We can find the most accessible example of cooperation and symbiosis as thepattern of evolution in our own bodies. Our bodies are made out of a hundredtrillion cells and vast colonies of microorganisms that work togetherseamlessly. In a previous stage of the Earth’s evolution, these organisms werefighting against each other for scarce resources. During a period of crisis,they figured out ways to collaborate to construct more complex structures –organs, like skin, eyes and lungs. In a way, all human technologies are justrecapitulations of technological feats we already find in the microcosm. Longbefore the Internet, viruses exchanged information – genetic code – around theworld at high speed.When humans cooperate to build a satellite dish, it is not that dissimilar tothe communities of specialized cells and microorganisms that assemble an eye oran ear. ‘As tiny parts of a huge biosphere whose essence is basically bacterial,we – with other life forms – must add up to a sort of symbiotic brain which itis beyond our capacity to comprehend or truly represent,’ Margulis wrote.Individual cells in our bodies do not hoard wealth – excess energy – but storeit in deposits of fat that are freely available to the cellular community as awhole. Cells contribute their efforts to the collective body without seekingmore for themselves, as energy flows seamlessly, going wherever it is needed.Without any competition, cells as well as organs work with maximum efficiencyfor the success of the whole.The NoosphereWe can understand the process we are undergoing as purposeful, teleological andeven implicitly designed – in the same way that nature designs conception,foetal development and birth on the level of an individual organism. Humanity,as a whole, constitutes a planetary super-organism, one unified being, in anongoing, symbiotic relationship with the ecology of the Earth as a whole system.The more we can individually prepare and awaken to our situation now and chooseto undergo initiation, the less collective suffering will be experienced byhumanity, as a whole. I believe each of us can realize this crisis we face as agreat adventure and a mission which dignifies human life and gives it meaning.In Non-Zero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Robert Wright noted that humans keepdeveloping increasingly larger and more complex forms of social organization –from the small tribe to the city-state, from national governments today, toextra-national bodies like the United Nations and the European Union. ForWright, this suggests an eventual transition to global government. I look atthis transition differently, believing that we will eventually transcendnational governments by establishing a harmonic planetary orchestration, wherelocal communities will function like the cells and organs in an efficient,selfregulating body. Once we evolve, we will have governance – planetaryself-regulation – without governments.Wright gives credit to the earlier work of the Catholic mystic andpalaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin, who introduced the idea of the noosphere(from the Greek word nous, meaning mind), which he described as a layer orenvelope of thought that encompasses the Earth. Writing in the first decades ofthe twentieth century, de Chardin proposed that, just as the Earth has anatmosphere, a lithosphere and a hydrosphere, it also has a surrounding layermade up of thought. For de Chardin, the noosphere already exists although mostare unaware of it. Humanity will reach a point where we consciously activate itby attaining a collective realization.De Chardin believed humanity’s realization of the noosphere to be a mysticalprocess through which we will discover, and celebrate, our inherent communionwith the cosmos: ‘Some day, after we have mastered the winds, the waves, thetides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love. Then for thesecond time in the history of the world, we will have discovered fire,’ hewrote.The inception of a harmonized planetary collective would light up the noosphericswitchboard. Our socio-political reality would no longer be distorted by greed.Our world would be shaped by wisdom, encompassing a long-term vision for humanbeings to live in healthy communion with our shared sister Earth. If we were toconsider love – what Sigmund Freud called Eros – as a biological drive, we mightdefine it as the instinct that binds separate entities into greater aggregates.For de Chardin – as well as Wright and a number of other thinkers – humanity’ssocial and technical development, seen as an extension of the Earth’s biologicalprocesses, suggest that our evolution has an underlying purpose and direction.Just as a plant flowers or a caterpillar morphs into a butterfly, we areinexorably, whether we like it or not, undergoing a metamorphosis into aharmonized collective – a superorganism. As we attain that state, we may findthat our interests and capacities change profoundly, just as a butterfly, nolonger crawling or devouring leaves, gains an added dimension of flight andstarts to pollinate. Rather than fearing what is coming, we can welcome it andrejoice in an opportunity to create a new world."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOHARD LIMITSimages [images/9781780289724_img02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"3EARTH CHANGESMany journalists have written surveys on the ecological mega-crisis and itssocial impacts. These chroniclers have travelled across the world, visiting thefront lines in Africa, Asia, South America and the Arctic. They have been partof the action at global climate summits, watching in horror as the US andChinese governments undermined agreements that could have helped stave offdecimation. Many of these writers also explore a range of possible strategiesfor adapting and mitigating, as well as preventing, the worst effects. Among theworks in this genre, I include Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Great Extinction,Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything, Mark Hertsgaard’s Hot: Living through theNext Fifty Years on Earth, Mark Lynas’s The God Species, Fred Pearce’s WithSpeed and Violence: Why Scientists Fear Tipping Points in Climate Change, BillMcKibben’s Eaarth as well as his earlier Deep Economy, and Rebecca Solnit’s AParadise Built in Hell.Although I recommend all of these books and consider them essential reading, myown contribution at this juncture is to offer something more philosophical –systemic in its critique, as well as strategic in its approach to how we makechange. I have been inspired by Murray Bookchin’s approach to social ecology,Hannah Arendt’s political philosophy, as well as Buckminster Fuller, who appliednature’s design principles to our species-wide crisis.Let’s start by looking back in time briefly. Over the last 60,000 years, sinceleaving Africa, the human species has developed language and culture, increasingin numbers, slowly at first, as we spread ourselves across the surface of theworld. For most of that time, we lived as small tribes of hunter-gatherers.Around 10,000 years ago, we began growing crops, building cities and launchingempires. Over the last few centuries, our species discovered steam power,electricity, coal, oil, mechanical technology and industry. We split the atomand beached on the moon.As its science and technologies advanced, the modern West constructed a newsocial model based on conspicuous consumption and planned obsolescence. Weexported this experimental way of life across the world. In a short span oftime, because of our capacity to exploit energy from fossil fuels – one barrelof oil holds the equivalent of 23,200 hours of manpower – humans went frombiospheric nonentity to the catalysts of a geological event. The crisisconfronting us is the result of what might prove to be our very short-livedsuccess as a species.As modern society became increasingly severed from nature, our science-basedculture propagated an ideology of materialism, dismissing any mystical orreligious belief system as antiquated and false. We rejected the natural, thefeminine and the intuitive, replacing them with the masculine ideals of order,logic and rationality. Faith in science and technology replaced religion formany people.This technological worldview has revealed its own internal contradictions and isreaching the point where it is starting to selfdestruct. I recently held adialogue with the neoliberal economist Nouriel Roubini, who was on PresidentBill Clinton’s cabinet and gained the nickname ‘Doctor Doom’ for accuratelypredicting the 2008 economic meltdown. Looking at the advance of robotics andartificial intelligence, Roubini predicts that robots will eventually replacehumans in all fields of activity, and that, in fact, the future belongs to themachines. This sterile Terminator scenario will happen, he believes, within thenext fifty years.I see this fatalistic viewpoint as the result of a narrow, reductiverationality. Rather than forfeiting our future to robots, we must learn tomaster our projections of technology, applying our genius for innovation tohumane and benevolent pursuits. We can then define a new trajectory for ourspecies, where we use our technologies to emancipate humanity, establishsocieties of sustainable abundance and explore the creative capacities of theliberated imagination – not a zero-sum game, but an infinite one. We are at thestart of a fantastic adventure – the plot we are in is just as dramatic asanything we have seen in films like Star Wars, Mission Impossible, The Matrix or2001.But before we can get to my proposed solutions and strategic action plan, weneed to be on the same page about what’s happening to our Earth. We must have ashared understanding of what we are doing to ourselves and our world. What Ibelieve to be my contribution to this debate won’t make much sense if we lack acoherent picture of what the science is telling us and what we can expect in thecoming century. Therefore, I am going to devote this chapter to the evidence andthe facts.For some readers this may be revelatory and fascinating. Perhaps it will beenough to spur them to action. For others, however, these sections may seemheavy going, drearily academic – the term ‘fucking depressing’ comes to mind –even though the subject directly relates to their future lives and the lives oftheir children. For the benefit of these readers, I will interrupt the flow fromtime to time, summing up the key points, riffing a bit along the way.Critics might assume that because I have a ‘spiritual’ (the terms I prefer areoccult or esoteric) perspective, I don’t care about the science. The truth isthe opposite. Our choices and our actions must flow from the cold, hardempirical evidence. I believe I am able to engage with it, frightening as it is,because I have explored the mystical and prophetic dimensions of what’shappening.When we fully accept and realize that this crisis is our invitation to undergo acollective metamorphosis – to establish something much better than we have now –then we can find the will and courage to handle the distressing specifics.Deepening global crisis is going to force transformation, one way or another.The best thing we can do is seize this chance to leverage a mass awakening.Dread or Detachment?Most people have, I find, a schizophrenic approach to the ecological threathanging over us. On the one hand, they feel dread – a sense of impendingdisaster. Young adults, kids in their twenties, tell me they believe we aredoomed. Therefore it doesn’t make sense even to try to do anything at this pointto change the situation – you might as well dedicate yourself to indie rock,Tinder hook-ups or other distractions. When we feel helpless to changesomething, we push it out of our minds. We treat it as a joke.Paradoxically, many people also believe that technology is going to develop soquickly that it will save us without them needing to lift a finger. Both ofthese ideas – that we are doomed and can’t do anything, so there is no reason totry, and that technological innovation will save the day – are popular memes,spread through the media. Although they are contradictory, many people thinkboth of these things at the same time. One theme the two ideas share is arejection of any sense of agency or responsibility: any possibility that we can,and must, change ourselves.I find the ecological movement guilty of this. Many well-funded groups organizemarches against pipelines, drilling and fracking – or against climate changeitself. But we can protest these things all we want and it won’t change anythingas long as we are still using way too much energy and squandering our naturalresources. We might stop a pipeline in one area, but the energy companies willsimply build one someplace else. Ultimately, the system is responding toconsumer demand. If we are going to avoid the most catastrophic outcome, socialbehaviour – as well as the beliefs propelling it – needs to change.People make the argument that it doesn’t matter if we in the West now change ourpath, because China – or India, or other stilldeveloping countries – will neverchange theirs. This is an assumption that supports continued passivity andabdicates responsibility. The fact is that Western society has not only spreadour industrialized, hyperindividual, consumerist model around the world, but hasrelentlessly marketed it as the best way for everyone to live. On the one hand,we’ve used financial pressure and biased trade agreements to force developingregions to adopt our values and conform to our agenda. On the other, we havebombarded these cultures with shallow, seductive, hypnotizing media – Dallas,Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, Sex and the City, the Kardashians – whichhave made it seem that everyone should aspire to the same standards of materialwealth and glamour.As our postmodern society undergoes a transformation of values and practices, wewill apply the same genius we use to sell innumerable gaudy, useless, breakablethings to promote and distribute a different way of living and being across theworld. We now know from many studies that our commercial, self-centred lifestyledoes not produce real contentment. Many commentators note that people intraditional societies, living within ecological limits, seem far happier thanthose who have adopted the Western consumer mindset. In traditional societies,we find far less crime, a deeper connection to nature, and vital spiritualtraditions. In these cultures, most people live in villages or smallcommunities. They trust and care about each other.I believe that the only way we can engineer a rapid turnaround is to repurposethe mass media and communications infrastructure the capitalist system hasbequeathed to us. Instead of marketing consumerism and keeping people fearful,our networks of media and social tools can promote different values –responsible, Earth-honouring ones – and solution-based approaches to our currentproblems. We can provide people with tangible tools for changing theirlifestyles in major and minor ways – sharing resources, conserving energy,building communities and so on. We can shift people away from dependence ondistant authorities towards local autonomy and resilience. Because human beingsare extremely adaptive, this transformation could happen surprisingly quickly.It requires, first, an imaginative leap.Modern society traps us in alienation. People continue to act as if theincreasingly obvious changes in climate and environment have no connection totheir lives or our collective future. If we are going to address our criticalsituation, we need to develop a wide-ranging vision, a systems-levelperspective. Individuals must step into leadership roles, not to amass power andwealth, but because they truly want to help.One big problem is that our brains evolved to deal with short-term dangers, likebeing stalked by a lion. We are not used to responding to threats that unfoldslowly, over a matter of decades. Doing so requires an act of will, intellectualapprehension and courage.We have been told there are experts in every field, with specialized, technicalknowledge far beyond what we can fathom. We count on these experts to handlethose problems that seem beyond the scope of our abilities. Immersed in theirdaily lives, most people don’t entertain the prospect that these experts andspecialists may themselves be mistaken. They may be operating with suchfragmentary knowledge that they lack the ability to comprehend the wholepicture, or to envision, let alone institute, the level of systemictransformation that will be needed.What if there are no experts in what the future will bring?Humanity has been put in command of what Buckminster Fuller called SpaceshipEarth. Fuller noted that although our spaceship was flawlessly designed, itlacked an instruction manual:In view of the infinite attention to all other details displayed by our ship, itmust be taken as deliberate and purposeful that an instruction manual wasomitted . . . The designed omission of the instruction book on how to operateand maintain Spaceship Earth and its complex life-supporting and regeneratingsystems has forced man to discover retrospectively just what his most importantforward capabilities are. His intellect had to discover itself.There is no doubt that our use of the planet’s finite resources must changedrastically while we seek to repair, as best we can, the damage we have alreadydone. We must apply our intellect to this task.For the sake of future generations and the greater community of life on Earth,we must find ways to overcome distractions, building a wave of collective actionthat will gather enough strength to overcome the resistance of those entrenchedand powerful forces that stand in our way. Such a movement can only be effectiveif we possess a clear idea of the positive outcome we seek as well as themethods we must apply to attain it.Because we are afraid of what’s coming, because we feel it is not ourresponsibility, and because the mass media doesn’t focus our attention properly,most people lack even the most rudimentary knowledge about what we are doing tothe Earth. I have spoken to graduate students studying sustainability and designat the School of Visual Arts in New York, and even they didn’t know the mostbasic information about species extinction, ocean acidification, climate changeand so on. In America, the typical adult can name over a thousand corporatelogos but fewer than ten species of native plants.People find themselves disconnected, detached from what is taking place,watching it like a movie. Conditioned and indoctrinated by a system designed todisempower them, many feel cynical about any possibility of changing the statusquo. This needs to change. We can educate ourselves about our situation and thenshare that information in a productive way. We can’t galvanize people intoaction by making them scared or miserable. The only thing that will inspirepeople to act, I believe, is a compelling and beautiful vision of the future – afuture they want to see for their children and grandchildren.‘Restoring the earth will take an enormous international effort, one far largerand more demanding than the often-cited Marshall Plan that helped rebuildwar-torn Europe and Japan,’ writes Lester Brown, the founder of WorldwatchInstitute, in Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization. ‘And such aninitiative must be undertaken at wartime speed lest environmental deteriorationtranslate into economic decline and state failure, just as it did for earliercivilizations that violated nature’s thresholds and ignored its deadlines.’Brown notes that the US industrial economy was able entirely to restructureitself in just a few months, following the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.This required a three-year ban on the sale of automobiles, as factories shiftedto producing planes, tanks, guns and other forms of military hardware. Asimilar, rapid redirection of our industrial system, globally, is necessary totransition energy production and other areas. This has happened in the past,during wartime, but never during peacetime and never on a planetary scale. Whatwill it take to bring this about? That, dear reader, is a crucial question.Planetary BoundariesProbably the best effort to define the full parameters of our current ecologicalsituation was made by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. In 2009, they broughttogether scientists and developed the planetary boundaries model. According tothis model, there are limits in nine areas that humanity can’t cross withoutendangering our own future as well as the health of the Earth.‘Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abruptglobal environmental change can no longer be excluded,’ the scientists noted.The planetary boundaries are: global warming, reduction of biodiversity,nitrogen runoff, land use, consumption of fresh water, acidification of theoceans, thinning of the ozone layer, aerosol pollution and atmospheric toxins.Currently, we have crossed at least four of these: climate change, loss ofbiodiversity, ozone layer depletion, and nitrogen pollution.Our situation is made more complex by the unanticipated ways these differentboundaries interact with each other. For instance, there was a period in thelast decades when global warming was slower than the scientific modelspredicted. Climate change deniers seized on this as evidence that global warmingwas a fraud. In all likelihood, this slowdown in warming was due to two factors.China massively increased coal production, leading to an enormous escalation ofsulphur dioxide in our atmosphere. The phenomenon is called ‘global dimming’.Although sulphur dioxide temporarily reduces warming, since the particlesreflect the sun’s rays, these soot particles don’t stay in the atmosphere forlong and cause other forms of ecological damage. Scientists also found that theoceans have been absorbing more CO2 than their models predicted. Once again,this is not something that will help us in the long term. Soon, the oceans willmax out their capacity to absorb CO2. At that point, like giant lungs, they willstart releasing it, which may accelerate warming.When we get into these types of fine-grained details of the mess we are in, westart to understand why James Lovelock believes we have already passed thetipping point which makes cataclysm inevitable. Lovelock is a highly esteemedscientist. He worked with microbiologist Lynn Margulis to develop the Gaiahypothesis, putting forward the theory that the Earth functions as aself-regulating system like a giant organism. In The Revenge of Gaia, Lovelockforesaw ‘an imminent shift in our climate towards one that could easily bedescribed as Hell: so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billionsnow alive will survive’.He predicted that a maximum of only 150 million people will be left alive at theend of this century. He could be right. But it is also possible that, throughglobally coordinated action – if we apply our genius as a species tocollectively beneficial ends – we can forestall this catastrophe and eventhrive.Above all, what the data on climate change – along with other aspects of theecological crisis, such as species extinction and ocean acidification – tells usis that the fate of our world is at stake. This is not happening in the future.It is not happening decades or centuries from today. It is happening now and wemust bring our focus to bear upon it.BiodiversityWe are currently in the Sixth Great Extinction in Earth’s history. Each day, anestimated 150 to 200 species disappear forever out of a total number of roughly8.7 million. Doing the maths, this means we are losing something like 10 percent of the remaining biodiversity every 10 to 15 years. The number is so highbecause we are currently polluting, over-settling, burning down andclear-cutting many of the most biodiverse places on Earth.It can be difficult to explain to people why maintaining biodiversity is crucialfor our own near-term survival. We have learned that ecosystems function ascomplex networks in which the different forms and varieties of life support eachother – when any tier is taken away, the entire system may change dramatically.It may rearrange itself or become radically simplified, with only one or ahandful of species proliferating.People became alarmed, recently, by the collapse of the bee population, becausebees, as pollinators, provide a crucial role in human agriculture. But othersmall organisms also have critical roles to play, down to the phytoplankton inthe oceans, which are affected by ocean acidification. As I noted earlier, thespeed of our industrial progress has been so incredible that we have not beenable to reckon with its effects. It didn’t occur to us, even twenty or thirtyyears ago, that we could empty the entire ocean of large fish – but that is whathas happened. More than 90 per cent of the large fish are gone, and the massivetrawlers which spread their nets in the seas have to go further and deeper out,collecting types of fish that would have been rejected as inedible a few yearsago.Ongoing loss of biodiversity may induce an abrupt change of conditions in thebiosphere as a whole, which could revert back to a simpler state, no longersuitable for large lumbering mammals such as ourselves. When too many speciesare removed, an entire ecosystem may collapse. This can happen on a local orglobal level. The danger is that there is an unforeseen tipping point beyondwhich a rapid planetary shift could take place, and this could happen fasterthan we are able to react to it.Global WarmingThe climate change planetary boundary is the most well known – even so, evenwith marches and protests around the world, it doesn’t compel the level ofcollective response that it should. It took science a while to catch up to thedynamics of global warming, but we now have a clear understanding of itsunderlying mechanisms. Before the Industrial Revolution, the climate wasrelatively stable for ten thousand years, a ‘Goldilocks period’ (not too hot,not too cold) which allowed human civilization to flourish. During this period,there were around 275 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere.Decaying vegetable matter as well as the oceans emit a huge amount of CO2, butthe oceans are also able to absorb it naturally, in a cycle similar torespiration. The residue from our industrial systems – we currently expel 300billion metric tons of CO2 annually (more than a million tons per hour) – cannotbe easily absorbed. It will linger in the atmosphere for a century, and accrueover time. We are now beyond 400 ppm of atmospheric CO2. The last time there wasthis much CO2 in the air, sea levels were 100 feet higher than they are todayand temperatures were four degrees Celsius warmer.Through studying the climate record preserved in ice-core samples, geologistshave learned that the climate generally doesn’t make a slow, incrementaltransition from one steady state to another. Instead, it tends to make a drasticlurch in a short timeframe. Glaciologists found that ‘roughly half of the entirewarming between the ice ages and the postglacial world took place in only adecade’, writes Fred Pearce in With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists FearTipping Points in Climate Change, with a temperature increase of nine degreesCelsius during that time. In the past two centuries, humanity has increasedlevels of carbon in the atmosphere by about a third. Our continued tinkeringruns the risk ‘of producing a runaway change – the climactic equivalent of asquawk on a sound system’.Already, global warming is drastically impacting on the planet far beyond whatscientists imagined or projected even a few years ago. The three hottest yearson record have all been in the last decade, with 2015 the hottest of all by asignificant amount, and 2016 set to eclipse it by a large margin.As Ramez Naam writes in The Infinite Resource:In Europe, half the mountain glacier cover seen a century ago in the Alps is nowgone. In Switzerland, 20 per cent has disappeared in the last fifteen years. InBritain, researchers looking at the flowering of plants and the migration ofanimals find that spring is coming eleven days earlier than it did in the middleof the twentieth century. In the United States, researchers see spring plant andanimal behaviour creeping three days earlier each decade, around twelve daysearlier since 1970. Sea levels around the world have risen seven inches in thelast century, and their rate of rise has doubled in the last ten years.According to climate scientist James Hansen, humanity already faces the ‘nearcertainty’ of an eventual sea-level rise of five to nine metres. As subsurfacewarming causes the melting of the Arctic ice sheets, sea levels will increase bymuch as three metres by 2050. He notes it is ‘unlikely that coastal cities orlow-lying areas such as Bangladesh, European lowlands and large portions of theUnited States eastern coast and northeast China plains could be protectedagainst such large sea level rise’.However, even in the worst-case scenario, if sea levels were to rise 100 to 150feet we would only lose 5 per cent of the Earth’s landmass. There would still beplenty of room for humanity to live and thrive. It has been estimated that theentire human population could be settled in an area the size of Texas, and eachfamily would still have room for a backyard garden. Similarly, the entire humanpopulation could stand, shoulder to shoulder, on an area the size of New YorkCity. This shows it is not the size of the human population that is the problem.It is our massively wasteful use of resources. As we will discuss, we have theability to design, build, even mass-manufacture, new urban areas and villagesthat are entirely self-sufficient, with food and energy produced on-site.Over the next years, as climate change accelerates and we hit other ecologicalconstraints, we will see escalating tensions between resource-starved countries,perhaps inciting wars, guerrilla insurgencies, terrorism, even nuclearconflicts. ‘Climate change will kill people directly, but most will die at thehands of other people made desperate by climate change,’ Stewart Brand predicts.Europe is already experiencing a refugee crisis as millions of desperate peopleflee Syria, a resource-starved country engaged in a vicious civil war. Droughtin Africa has also resulted in migration to Europe. This is only the beginningof a process we will soon see unfolding across the world.Take the country of Bangladesh where 157 million people live at zero to fivemetres above sea level. While many of us in the US and Europe have enjoyedlifestyles of luxury that require huge carbon emissions, the average Bangladeshiearns less than a thousand dollars a year and has a minuscule ecologicalfootprint. As sea levels rise in the next decades, much of Bangladesh willbecome uninhabitable as fresh-water sources are infiltrated by the sea. India isalready building a massive fence to keep out Bangladeshi refugees.In a sense, one could argue that we in the developed world are no better thanthe worst and most barbaric regimes of the past. We have known for decades thatour continued inaction on CO2 emissions is a form of passive genocide committedagainst the most vulnerable populations of the Earth, but we remain wilfullyunconscious about our impacts.There is nothing we can do to change the past, but we can face the present. Aspractitioners of Huna, the spiritual discipline associated with Hawaii, put it:‘Now is the moment of power.’ Now is the only moment – in other words – when wecan accept our personal responsibility for the fate of our shared, imperilledworld. Now is also the moment when we can choose to put aside petty concerns andto act, instead, as biospheric agents, conceiving our own lives as catalyticprocesses, applying our energies and intellect for the greater good.Feedback LoopsEcological disaster is being accelerated by a large number of feedback loopsthat amplify climate change and other problems as they are set into motion.These feedbacks are something like a snowball falling from a mountaintop,picking up momentum, causing more snow to fall, until it causes an avalanche.Many of these were not well understood or anticipated until recently. All ofthem point towards the necessity of rapid, coordinated action to ensure ourcontinuity on this planet.One feedback loop is the interaction between the loss of Arctic ice and what iscalled the albedo effect: the cooling of the Earth that depends in part upon themassive ice sheets that reflect the sun’s rays, like a giant mirror. As the icesheet shrinks and breaks apart, the albedo effect is diminished. Large areas gofrom white shiny ice to dark blue ocean. Instead of reflecting sunlight backinto space, the Arctic absorbs more sunlight, which speeds up the warmingprocess.The Arctic is currently warming four times faster than the rest of the planet.Incredibly, in the winter of 2015, the Arctic reached a temperature that wasover 30 degrees Celsius above its usual average – essentially, briefly reachingthe melting point of zero degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. While thiswas partly due to the natural warming cycle caused by fluctuations in the jetstream, it was still unprecedented, and – let’s admit it – very frightening. InThe God Species, Mark Lynas, a journalist who has travelled the world to writeabout climate change, admits he is astonished by ‘the sheer rapidity of changealready under way in the Earth system, changes I never dreamt I would see soquickly when I started working on this subject more than ten years ago’.Despite Silicon Valley’s euphoria over our capacity for innovation, we don’thave any technological fixes for these runaway effects. We know, for instance,that the incidence of forest fires has been increasing for a number of years. Asmall amount of global warming is drying out the forests, making them moresusceptible to fires. The forests act as carbon sinks, inhaling CO2 and exhalingthe oxygen we breathe. As they dry out and burn, releasing CO2, globaltemperature increases, leading to more drying out of the remaining forests,which become even more susceptible to fire. This process, unfortunately, alreadyseems to be cascading in the wrong direction.In the autumn of 2015, the news was filled with reports of massive forest firesacross the northwest of the United States, Alaska and Canada. These fires wereunprecedented in size and ferocity. One blaze in Idaho engulfed 265,000 acres,while Alaska lost five million acres of forest, an area the size of Connecticut.With all of the fires across the Pacific Northwest and Canada, 11 million acres,17,000 square miles, have been scorched – and the burning continues. As I writethis, a massive forest fire in Alberta, Canada (where temperatures were twentydegrees Celsius above average for a few days in May) forced a mass evacuation ofthe entire population of Fort McMurray – 80,000 people.In the past few years, the forests of Indonesia have been intensively assaultedand reduced by fire, with giant plumes of smoke visible from space. Many ofthese blazes are caused intentionally, so that forest land can be converted topalm oil plantations. The increased use of palm oil as an ingredient in manycheap processed foods has created an ecological disaster.Somehow, we must rally humanity to protect the remaining forests, in particularour tropical rainforests, and engage in a cooperative process to reforest theplanet. The tropical rainforests are estimated to produce as much as 20 per centof the oxygen we breathe. Most of us would, I believe, like to keep breathing –even if Ray Kurzweil believes that nanobots in our lungs will soon do it for us.Arctic MethaneWe now confront the greatest – and, until recently, a totally unanticipated –danger of rapid warming, through the release of methane from under the Arctic.According to one estimate, there are 1,600 billion tons of carbon trappedbeneath the oceans and locked in Siberian permafrost. Although it only stays inthe atmosphere for ten years, methane is more than twenty times more potent thanCO2 as a greenhouse gas. If methane erupts in large quantities, this willaccelerate the warming cycle, releasing more methane. ‘If such a runaway eventwere to take place, it could occur within forty years or less, and wouldtransform the earth into a biological desert,’ notes Paul Hawken.In 2007, ‘atmospheric levels of methane began to spike’, according to BillMcKibben. In 2011, Russian researchers found spumes of methane as much as akilometre in diameter releasing from the Arctic. Scientists now understand that,in previous epochs, eruptions of thawing methane from under the Arctic inducedmass extinctions. Unfortunately, a rise in temperature of two degrees Celsiusabove pre-industrial levels may pass the threshold at which the methane releasesin vast quantities. Some scientists now believe a 1.5-degree temperature rise isthe maximum we can handle.To deal with the methane threat – probably the greatest danger now facinghumanity, outside of nuclear war – we must severely curtail emissions, reducethe levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and get to carbon neutral ornegative as quickly as we possibly can. At the same time, we must remove excesscarbon from the air, and apply other non-invasive techniques to cool our planet.Some of these are so simple, it is absurd that we are not already putting theminto practice.For instance, we can paint all of our urban rooftops white to mimic the albedoeffect. As Mark Hertsgaard writes in Hot, it is estimated that the averageAmerican household ‘could counteract the ten tons of CO2 it annually emits byretrofitting one thousand square feet of roof or sidewalk with reflectivesurfaces. Retrofitting all urban roofs and pavements in the world would yieldemissions reductions equivalent to taking all the world’s cars off the road foreighteen years.’ As a global initiative, we could engineer mass plantings offorests, trees and gardens. ‘The earth’s plants and soils are not yet removingenough CO2 to halt rising temperatures, but they could do much more with properstewardship,’ Hertsgaard notes.Within the next few decades, assuming we want a future for humanity, we need tobring about a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, along with a globaltransition to renewable energies and low-carbon fuel sources. Since we havewaited too long, this reduction must be as much as 8–10 per cent annually, for anumber of years. Luckily, a great deal of our CO2-producing activity is wastefuland unnecessary, and could be quickly eliminated once we find the will to do so.Admittedly, we face what seems a socially impossible task. Although there isnothing stopping us, physically, from making the sudden changes in species-widepatterns of behaviour necessary to avert cataclysm, it seems inconceivable –culturally, politically and financially – that we will do so. Yet we must.Who Do We Blame?Many times, when I try to talk about the ecological emergency with prosperousneoliberal and liberal types, the quick answer they give me is that the world’spopulation has grown too large. They either state directly or insinuate thatnature will take care of this by wiping billions of people off the map. For themost part, I find, they don’t include themselves in those billions who will beconsigned to oblivion.The inconvenient truth is that overpopulation is not our major problem. In fact,across the developing world, at least until recently, most people lived withinsustainable limits, with a tiny ecological footprint. They farmed locally andate their own produce. They didn’t drive cars, waste polystyrene, wear clothesproduced in Cambodian sweatshops, fly somewhere warm to relax for a springbreak, or buy new computers and smart phones every few years. The reason we arerapidly approaching total ecological collapse is the consumerist lifestyle ofAmerica and Europe, which we have spread across the planet.I cannot deny that it would be a good idea to taper off the rising population –I think this can and should be done in a humane and empathic way. Birth ratesactually decline naturally as women attain a higher status, approaching equalitywith men, having more access to education and work opportunities. In otherwords, if we elevate the status of women everywhere, the global population will,gently and naturally, decline.While 80 per cent of emissions are produced by just 20 per cent of the world’spopulation, probably 50 per cent of emissions come from as little as 1 per centof the population – the wealthy people of the developed world. But the prospectthat this 1 per cent will voluntarily reduce their consumption – or be forced todo so – is never proposed or considered. It runs counter to our intrinsic senseof privilege and the cult of wealth that underlies the capitalist game. Or, inother words, it goes against everything our globalized society – ourtechnophiliac New World Order – believes or stands for.‘We don’t require the whole world to do something’, notes Kevin Anderson, a UKclimate scientist from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, ‘we require asmall proportion of the world to change what they do today for the next ten ortwenty years while we put low carbon supply in place. Then we can go back to ourold profligate lifestyles.’ Unfortunately, the longer we wait, the amount ofrapid reductions of emissions that we need to accomplish will increase, untilthe goal is out of reach.Let’s stop here for a moment. Let’s think about this.If it stings a little, let it sting.I want to hold your attention, for a heartbeat or two, on that last commentAnderson makes about the need for a small proportion of the world to changetheir behaviour. Please realize that this is not just another idea in an oceanof nice-sounding ideas. What he is talking about is fundamentally necessary sothat humanity as a whole – a group that includes our children, or, if we don’thave kids, the kids of our friends and relatives, or if we have no friends,those little beings who occasionally smile shyly at us as they totter along –can survive and, eventually, thrive. What he is talking about requires that youand I change our behaviour and lifestyle.Let’s be brutally honest with ourselves: we can continue as we are now and watchour planet burn out, or we can change ourselves to change the world. If weprefer the second option, we must commit ourselves to a necessary task – aredemptive, spiritual mission. Our mission, if we choose to accept it, is thatwe work together to build a regenerative society, restoring the health of ourbiosphere for the long term. This project will be the work of futuregenerations, also. What we can accomplish in our lives – the beginning of agreat turning – will be our legacy to them.I know it seems highly unlikely that the super-rich are going to swear off theirprivate jets, their holiday outings in the Caribbean, their third houses inIbiza, their ironically sumptuous (wink wink) Burning Man camps, their capitalinvestments in new hotels and luxury highrises. However, things can change. Alot of things are changing right now. They will be changing even more quickly inthe years ahead of us.Unfortunately, the wealthier people on the planet believe themselves likely tobe the least affected by ecological catastrophe, figuring they can always flyoff to some new still somewhat unspoiled place. While understandable from theirperspective, this is stupid, short-term thinking. As I mentioned above, 20 percent of the oxygen that we all, collectively, including the 1 per cent and the.001 per cent breathe, is emitted by the forests which are being slashed, burnt,mowed down to create more profit centres. If we lose too much biodiversity, theintricately interdependent web of life will crumble to dust, taking all of usdown with it. Also, even the super-rich are running out of unspoiled places.The ecological meltdown we confront, in fact, will eventually impact uponeveryone on Earth. In the end, nobody is getting out of this one. Not RichardBranson or Donald Trump or the Koch Brothers – even if they happen to croakearly, their kids and grandkids will have to face it. Perhaps there are bunkersdeep underground somewhere for the Illuminati super-wealthy, outfitted withcenturies of food, futuristic sex toys and other stockpiles. If so, I don’t envythem that depressing, guilt-riddled future.I have to admit – perhaps this reflects poorly on my character, but as Imentioned earlier I am no paragon of virtue and can, at times, be an asshole –that I didn’t shed a tear when Harbin Hot Springs, epicentre of NorthernCalifornia luxury hippie culture, burnt to the ground as forest fires swept theregion. I almost felt this was a good thing, as a lot of transformationalpotential seems trapped in the Bay Area. The ecological, social justice andhuman potential movements all have West Coast headquarters. Maybe we need theprogressive community to feel the heat – to get so uncomfortable they will breakthrough whatever obstacles have kept them from challenging and changing themainstream.The consciousness revolution should, by now, have spread out from that areaacross the planet. But people fell into a smug, selfsatisfied lifestyle. Insteadof stripping themselves down in the quest for enlightenment, they stopped atwhat Chögyam Trungpa called ‘spiritual materialism’. Perhaps the drought, theburning forests, and, now, the lack of hot springs where hippies can nakedlybathe and cavort will be enough to start an exodus.The interesting thing about social behaviour is that it is extremely contagious.People tend to do what their peers do – and they can switch their beliefs andhabits quickly, even immediately, when the reward structure changes around them.Malcolm Gladwell called this the tipping point. The maverick scientist RupertSheldrake proposes a more sophisticated model, based on something he callsmorphic resonance, or the hundredth monkey principle. His idea is that when acertain small percentage of a species learns a new skill, that ability becomeseasier to transfer to others – and can even transfer instantly, without directcontact, through some unknown mechanism, perhaps quantum nonlocality. Patternsof thought and action may create new fields of resonant potential that canbecome species-wide traits.When you or I make a change in our behaviour, this affects and impacts upon thepeople around us directly and then the people around them, adding up to manymore people. According to the morphic resonance theory, it may not be asdifficult to effect large-scale change as we tend to think it is – particularlynow, when we are so tightly linked together through networks.Behaviour can change in a millisecond. I have seen examples of this at BurningMan – the festival functions as a laboratory for hedonic engineering andexperimental paths to social change. Investment bankers, corporate lawyers, CEOs– highly intelligent people who tend to be motivated by personal reward morethan abstract principles of ecological ethics – come to Burning Man and, in lessthan a day, they conform to a new set of social norms, responding to the cuesaround them. Their new behaviour patterns include ‘leaving no trace’, givingaway stuff, hugging, smiling, building community structures, helping strangersput up their tents, sharing their drugs and so on. At Burning Man, wanderingaround in a pink tutu, saying ‘namaste’, talking about your chakras, and pickingup trash will gain you community acceptance and love. If being friendly,thoughtful and caring suddenly increases your status, gets you laid, brings youbetter drugs and makes you popular, then that is what you will do.Interestingly, most of the changes we now need to make as a species so that wecan all survive and prosper and our descendants can thrive would actually bebeneficial for everyone, following an initial, awkward, admittedly uncomfortableperiod of adjustment. Today, for instance, many people live alone in smallapartments, separated from their families and close friends. Bringing peopletogether again to live communally in multi-generational compounds – as ourtribal ancestors did – would be a powerful way to reduce consumption and waste.It would also make people happier, healthier and calmer.I remember visiting Havana, Cuba, in 1999, where cars were rare, and peopleride-shared and hitchhiked. This created a feeling of social cohesion andcamaraderie – a sense that ‘we are all in this together’. If ride sharing, andother forms of sharing, were encouraged or even (dare I say it?) enforced –systemically implemented using geolocating apps – it would have the same effect.Given a new incentive, life could become much better, not worse. People wouldhave to learn to trust and care for each other once again.The most luxurious vacation of my life was the week I spent at a retreat centrein Colombia without electricity. At night, torches would be lit. When they wentoff, we were bathed in starlight. I never saw so many stars. There was no usefor our cell phones or laptops. When my brain discharged its static internalnoise after a few days, I began to feel a level of natural peace and contentmentbeyond anything I had known for a long time.We have been deluded by the momentum of our post-industrial society. We aretaught to believe that progress only moves in one direction. The retreatrevealed that many of the things our civilization believes to be necessary areactually just impediments that keep us cluttered and distracted. In the future,masses of people may realize that living with friends and family, in beautifulcommunities close to nature, where life is as self-sufficient and sustainable aspossible, with minimal electronic interference, would be the ultimate lifestyle– and it is one that we can attain.In any event, one essential point to grasp is that all of the changes inlifestyle and behaviour that we need collectively to adapt for our survival willhave this side benefit: they will make the world kinder, gentler, happier, morecooperative, more loving. Living altruistically and cooperatively is closer toour basic nature as human beings than continuing our current state of alienationand competition. It is, after all, what we did for many thousands of years, asnomadic tribal people. Now we have to realize humanity as one unified tribe.You may notice how all the solutions proposed in this book imply that we will beforced to live in a more responsible, truly adult fashion. In other words, thereis something more in these practical solutions than just ‘saving the world’ –the same behaviours that support flourishing ecosystems will also force us tobehave more wisely, carefully and compassionately – to act, ironically, as we’veoften wished we could, if we had the time or inner motivation to try.Now let’s return to the evidence – the terrible, heart-breaking facts about whatwe are doing as a species, out of our greed, hubris and stupidity. Please staywith me. The thing to remember is that – unlike sports statistics, news onDonald Trump’s hair or Paris Hilton’s sex habits, or myriad other titbits thatwhirl past us in the course of a day – these facts about the planetaryboundaries will have a direct impact on our lives, in the near future. They willbe of great concern, soon, for all of our children. Quite likely, they will bethe focus of attention for everyone within a few short decades.NitrogenThe third planetary boundary, nitrogen pollution, is also one we have exceeded.The exponential growth of the human population over the last century is oftenlinked to the invention in 1909 of the Haber– Bosch process for synthesizingammonia, which made it possible to add nitrogen to crops, by producingartificial fertilizer, using petrochemicals. An essential component of allproteins, nitrogen is in short supply in nature – nitrates are produced bylightning, and also by a number of beans and legumes able to fix nitrogen in thesoil through a symbiotic partnership with microbes that live in their roots.Nitrogen runoff – along with phosphorous pollution – from agriculture hascreated enormous dead zones in lakes, oceans and wetlands. There are over 400 ofthese dead zones across the world’s coastlines. Some of them are enormous – likethe one around the Gulf of Mexico, which swells to 20,000 square kilometres inthe summer. Excess nitrogen reduces biodiversity and accelerates climate change,since the industrial process to produce it emits greenhouse gases. We mustreduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment by two-thirds, from100 million to 35 million tons annually, even though this will be difficult,considering that the current food production system depends upon huge inputs ofartificial, fossil-fuel-based fertilizer for agriculture. However, as we willdiscuss, we need to change our approach to producing food in any case.Land UseCurrently, an estimated 12 per cent of the Earth’s surface is used for arablefarming, while as much as 30 per cent of all land is used for animal grazing.Scientists believe that 15 per cent is the maximum amount of arable farmland theEarth can tolerate. We haven’t reached that level yet, but as drought conditionsintensify because of global warming, the issue of land use is going to become amajor one. This will be especially true if populations expand to an estimated 9billion by mid-century, and if developing countries like China and Indiacontinue to demand more meat, which requires intensive inputs of water andgrain,The greatest species diversity – more than 40 per cent of plants and 30 per centof animals – is found in a few dozen small areas that account for a little over1 per cent of total landmass. We should seek to protect these areas, inparticular. But many of them are under threat.Malaysia, for instance, loses more than 5 per cent of its remaining forestsevery decade. Reasons for deforestation include demands for palm oil,urbanization, and various forms of clearing for agriculture. Mining is anotherfactor as are hydropower and irrigation projects. Only about a fifth ofMalaysia’s original rainforest covering now remains, scattered in fragmentsacross the region. Many developing countries are in similar straits.The biologist Edward O Wilson proposes that humanity should set aside as much as50 per cent of the Earth’s surface area as a nature preserve. Although thatsounds a bit extreme and unlikely, it is worth noting that, in the past, in manyareas of the Earth, humans were actually caretakers and stewards of theirnatural environment. Evolution weeded out the ones who couldn’t manage theirlocal habitat – like the Easter Islanders, who left behind a number of enormousstone heads but no trees and few people. A good plan for the future mightinclude reducing animal grazing lands significantly for reforestation,establishing larger nature preserves, and re-educating people so they becomestewards and gardeners of their home rather than despoilers and extractors.Fresh WaterWater may be the defining issue of the twenty-first century. Patterns ofrainfall are changing around the world, as some areas suffer increasing monsoonswhile others enter permanent drought conditions. Global warming causes moreferocious floods as well as disastrous droughts. ‘Drought is especiallypunishing for the hundreds of millions of subsistence farmers around the worldfor whom rain is the only source of water,’ Hertsgaard notes. Within the nextdecade, it is estimated that the number of people living in water-stressedcountries will increase from 800 million to 3 billion. We are already seeing‘water wars’, although they are not generally billed as such.According to the planetary boundaries group, human use of fresh water should notexceed 4,000 cubic kilometres per year, of which we use an estimated 2,600 today– still within the limits, despite the myriad other impacts of ourhydro-engineering practices. Scientists from Stockholm University estimate wehave already passed that threshold, consuming more than 4,300 cubic kilometresannually, with 70 per cent used for agriculture. According to one extraordinarystatistic, over 15,000 litres of water are required to produce one pound ofbeef. Other estimates have us slightly below the boundary threshold. Around theworld, humans have constructed around 800,000 dams that block the natural flowof water, fragmenting most of the world’s largest rivers. Even so, over abillion people lack access to reliable sources of clean water, and 2.6 billionpeople lack proper sanitation.According to Mark Lynas, these dams ‘impound approximately 10,000 cubickilometres of water – a quantity so substantial that it measurably reduces therate of sea-level rise (by about half a millimetre a year for the lasthalf-century) and even changes the mass distribution of the planet sufficientlyto alter its axis and slightly increase the speed of its rotation’. Manyscientists believe we should seek to reverse some of the changes we have made tothe natural course of rivers and drainage basins.Meanwhile, glaciers and icepacks are rapidly melting around the world.Mountaintop glaciers feed rivers, streams and aquifers in India, Tibet and Peru,as well as California, sustaining billions of people who settled in the valleysbelow these sources, which have flowed reliably for tens of thousands of years.Their disappearance will cause social dislocations on a scale we cannot yetimagine. There is potential for a rapid scaling up of desalinization plants,particularly if this technology is improved, and if it can be powered byrenewables. In that case, we might be able to have as much abundant fresh wateras we need. However, we are still far from prepared for the water scarcity weare confronting globally.Ocean AcidificationAlthough less discussed, ocean acidification is another huge and worseningproblem. Up to 85 per cent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphereeach year ends up in the oceans, altering their chemical composition. In thelast 40 years, we have made the world’s oceans 30 per cent more acidic, as theyabsorb excess CO2 pollution like gigantic lungs. One major concern is that theoceans may soon reach the limit in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide theycan absorb, at which point they would start to emit carbon, rather than storingit. This feedback loop would accelerate warming.Coral reefs are largely made of calcium carbonate, which is extremelysusceptible to acidity. As the oceans grow more corrosive, the coral reefs willfirst die, then dissolve, disappearing completely. This deterioration is alreadyunderway. Marine biologists at the Royal Society believe the coral reefs ‘willbe in rapid and terminal decline world-wide’ by mid-century if not sooner. Withthem will go much of the ocean’s biodiversity. We are already seeing the massproliferation of species like jellyfish and squid, which are filling theecological niches left vacant as fish populations crash.As of now, I haven’t heard of many plans of action that can address oceanacidification. There are some geo-engineering ideas, but they seem far-fetched.One scheme involves putting masses of calcium carbonate or silicate materialinto the oceans – essentially, like giving the oceans a gigantic antacid, aTums. To make any kind of difference, this would require mining such a hugevolume of rock that this effort would be highly improbable, most likelyimpossible. Google Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil, in The Singularity isNear, proposes the creation of nanobots – minuscule robots – that can clean upthe oceans for us. So far, this remains fantasy.Environmental ToxinsThe level of environmental toxins and pollutants the Earth can absorb has notbeen established as a set limit. We know that plastic polymers and otherindustrial compounds have infiltrated every ecosystem on the planet. They alsoconcentrate through the food chain, and in our tissues, where they causecancers, reproductive disorders and other adverse health effects. Chris Jordanhas photographed dead birds on Midway Island – 2,000 miles away from the nearestcontinent – with their gullets full of plastic. Perhaps evolution – or futuretechnologies – will find ways to make use of our synthetic polymers, but theprocess of breaking them down naturally will take millions of years.Even so, industries continue to create new compounds, willy-nilly, and add themto the exotic bouquet of chemicals that is impacting on our fragile environment.Even where there have been studies of how individual compounds affect humanhealth, there are no studies of the potential impact of multiple new chemicalswhen combined. A 2009 study of US drinking water, testing for pharmaceuticalsand endocrinedisrupting chemicals, found 34 contaminants in just one sample,including atrazine (a herbicide), diazepam (Valium), risperidone (ananti-psychotic) and fluoxetine (Prozac).Environmental contamination is considered responsible for the sudden enigmaticdecline of some species around the world, including amphibians, butterflies andbats. Anecdotally, I am seeing many people I know developing strange allergies,chemical sensitivities, food intolerances and so on. This may be due to thechemical load we are all taking on, just by being subject to this strangelaboratory experiment that corporations are subjecting us to out of a drive toincrease their margins of profit.Aerosol PollutionThe limit of the aerosols boundary is similarly unknown. Air pollution isresponsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths each year in China alone. Thedeveloped world of the West has cleaned up its air over the last decades,largely by relocating factory production, mining and smelting to the developingworld of the South and to Asia. In some cities in China, the air is barelybreathable, and we see photos of Chinese people wearing facemasks as they goabout their days. A Canadian company recently started selling bottles of freshair to them. The soot produced by factories in the US, China and elsewhereultimately drifts around the world, sparing nobody.Aerosol pollution has a significant effect on the climate and the hydrologicalcycle. Globally, smokestack pollution from the North is thought to havecontributed to a major decades-long drought in the Sahel region of Africa in the1970s and 80s. Aerosol emissions are also causing a rapid decline in the monsoonseason in India, Burma and Thailand, threatening the food production andlivelihoods of a billion people.Humanity nearly caused its own extinction by inadvertently trespassing into theozone boundary, although we now have the situation under control to some extent.One man, alone, was nearly responsible for bringing our life as a species to anabrupt, sickening end: the American chemist Thomas Midgley, who worked forGeneral Motors in the 1920s and 30s, developing non-flammable coolants forrefrigerators, discovered chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) also known as Freon, asynthesis of chlorine, fluorine and carbon, which became widely used.In the 1970s, scientists discovered that CFCs were circulating throughout theEarth’s atmosphere, where they were breaking down ozone, causing a thinning ofthe ozone layer, which protects the Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation.In the 1980s, a major international effort led to the Montreal Protocol, whichphased out the use of CFCs. Due to the ongoing circulation of gases alreadyreleased, the ozone layer is still thinning, but at a slower rate. It isestimated that the ozone layer could return to its pre-industrial level of ozoneconcentration by 2075, barring further tampering.The world’s success in handling ozone pollution can be taken as a positive sign.It proves the human community does have the ability to come together and changeour industrial practices, when necessary. If we did it with ozone, we can, intheory anyway, do it with CO2 – not to mention nitrogen, factory farming,genetically modified organisms, aerosol pollutants and the other factorsaccelerating us towards global meltdown. Of course, CO2 is a tough one, becauseit is so pervasive.On the other hand, the threat to our species unleashed by CFCs is an example ofthe unintended consequences of new technological breakthroughs. We should thinkabout this in relationship to nanotechnology, biotechnology and other areas thatthe corporate elite promote as solutions to the hellish problems our industrialtechnologies have already unleashed. The past breakthroughs that were supposedto make everything great had tremendous negative consequences that wereunanticipated. The new technologies – interacting with the processes of life andmatter at a deeper level – could have even more destructive impacts. Thisdoesn’t mean we shouldn’t develop new technologies, but we must do so within anethical framework and an ecological worldview that considers long-termconsequences rather than prioritizing short-term comforts and immediate profits.What Do We Do?Living in New York City, I see new buildings going up all the time. I don’t seethese buildings covered in solar panels feeding energy back to the grid, orvegetable gardens on their rooftops. We keep building luxury condominiums andhotels, not earth ships and vertical farms.Young people still feverishly pursue careers in the art world, fashion, rockmusic, celebrity journalism, marketing; they get their degrees in old masterpaintings and French critical theory and so on – I look over their shoulders inEast Village cafes to see what they are typing away on – but, honestly, ifpeople understood what was coming, we would be applying our intelligencedifferently. Young people would pursue careers in ecosystem management,permaculture, wetland restoration, carbon sequestration. The best and brightestwould be learning how to share and conserve resources, how to organize localcommunities to maximize resilience, practices of active nonviolence and so on.Our system doesn’t reward all of the work that desperately needs to be done now,and it over-rewards everything that shouldn’t be done – such as using financialtools to extract money from the poor and middle class and funnel it to thewealthy, or marketing new trends that seduce people into buying more clothes,cars and gadgets. Financial world predators, unleashing global chaos from theircomputer terminals, make exponentially more than primary school teachers ornurses who take care of the old and sick. And we are all caught in this system.A major problem is our culture’s entrenched ideal of individualism. This issomething we must supersede, even though it is hard to imagine how to do so. Inreality, our independence as individuals depends on our interdependence – witheach other and all of life. Our current social and economic system obscures thisbasic truth. We should, instead, devise systems, in alignment with nature’sprinciples, that help us realize it.What’s coming may seem bleak and chaotic – but there are many amazing solutionsalready within our reach. Others are just on the edge of becoming feasible.Actually, the technical solutions are kind of the easy part, as we will see. Themore difficult struggle will be to change our political and economic system sothat we can implement the technical solutions rapidly. This requires that webring about an evolution of consciousness in a short period. But even this – Ibelieve, on good days – can be done. After all, we built a global communicationsinfrastructure over the last decades that is like a central nervous system. Themultitude can trade ideas and adapt new social tools instantly.So far, many existing alternatives remain little known. We must act to changethis situation as quickly as possible. We now know that renewable energytechnologies can be exponentially scaled up in a few decades to supply theentire world’s population with non-polluting energy. If we coordinate a globaltransition to regenerative, organic and no-till agriculture, we will be able toput a great deal of excess CO2 back in the soil. That transition can also becombined with the rapid distribution of regenerative technologies, like biochargasifiers and biodigestors that convert organic waste into fuel whilesequestering CO2. We can stop all unnecessary forms of industrial manufacturingwhile we establish networks for sharing and conserving our remaining resources.All of this, in fact, is what we need to do. But how can we do it?Now let’s consider how we will transform our technical infrastructure if wedecide to change our direction as a species, beginning with energy."},{"pageContent":"PART THREEREGENERATIVE SOLUTIONSimages [images/9781780289724_img02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"4ENERGYAs the residue of millions of years of stored sunlight, fossil fuels were aone-time-only bequest from Earth to humanity. They gave us the opportunity tobuild a global machine-based civilization, in a few short centuries. Over thelast 150 years, we have accessed an enormous quantity of cheap energy.Incredibly, just one gallon of petrol equals 500 hours of human work output.Granted this largesse, it is not surprising we became utterly dependent on cheapfuel.‘Cheap oil is not a useful part of our economy,’ writes Bill McKibben, ‘It isour economy.’ The availability of cheap energy allowed for the production ofinessential goods, impelling the growth of a mass consumer society over the last200 years. ‘Oil provides 40 per cent of all energy used by human beings onEarth, and it powers nearly all transportation in the industrial world. It’salso the most important raw material for plastics, agricultural and industrialchemicals, lubricants, and asphalt roads,’ writes John Michael Greer. Accordingto Peak Everything author Richard Heinberg: ‘Without petrochemicals, medicalscience, information technology, modern cityscapes, and countless other aspectsof our modern technology-intensive lifestyles would simply not exist. In all,oil represents the essence of modern life.’As predicted by the oil company geologist M King Hubbert, we have passed thecritical threshold, known as peak oil, when most of the easily available oil hasbeen extracted from the Earth. We have entered a new phase in which fossil fuelsbecome more difficult and expensive to extract, following the downward declineof a bell curve. However, as I write this, the fact that oil has become morecostly to extract is not reflected in market pricing – in fact, energy priceshave been going down, and the market is glutted. There are many reasons forthis. It is possible that oil-producing countries are keeping prices low tostall the development of renewables. There is also the fact that we are nowextracting more fuel from non-traditional sources. But this is not a good thing.As we run out of traditional sources of fossil fuels, energy corporationspursue, with ever-increasing fervour, procedures such as hydrofracking fornatural gas, mountaintop removal to access coal reserves, and extracting oilfrom the Alaskan Tar Sands. Their success in developing new processes foraccessing these resources has contradicted the predictions of peak oildoomsayers. But this is only a temporary reprieve, and the ecological impacts ofthese practices are devastating.The depletion of traditional sources also explains the recent initiative tomass-produce ethanol out of corn. A global rush towards biofuels resulted inglobal famines, as well as food riots in 37 countries, in 2008. In the future,the depletion of fossil fuel supplies, as well as the limits of our ‘carbonbudget’, could make large-scale projects, requiring intensive development of newtechnology and infrastructure, increasingly difficult to achieve. That isanother reason – besides accelerating warming – that we should be seeking toswitch to renewables now, when energy is still readily available.Jeremy Leggett, president of Solar Century, writes, ‘Peak oil is not a theory.Because oil is a finite resource, it is an inevitability. The debate is allabout its timing.’ Saudi Arabia, and other oil-producing nations, have passedtheir peak of production. What follows could be a surprisingly quick decline.Eventually, even unconventional sources of hydrocarbons will run out.Leggett reports that many experts and insiders ‘think there will be a drop inproduction within just a few years, and we are in danger of that drop being sosteep as to merit description as a collapse’. This collapse would affect notonly manufacturing and transportation, but our food system, which requiresmassive inputs of petroleum to make fertilizer, and for long-distance transport.The average morsel of food in the US travels over 1,500 miles.In the 1960s, Buckminster Fuller realized we needed to use our resources offossil fuels to switch to unlimited, renewable sources. ‘The fossil fueldeposits of our Spaceship Earth correspond to our automobile’s storage batterywhich must be conserved to turn over our main engine’s self-starter,’ he noted.‘Thereafter, our “main engine”, the life regenerative processes, must operateexclusively on our vast daily energy income from the powers of wind, tide,water, and the direct Sun radiation energy.’ Unfortunately, society went in theopposite direction, burning massive reserves of fossil fuel without establishinga new infrastructure based on renewable energy.As a side benefit, if we make a global transition to renewable energy sources,we will eliminate air pollution. ‘The idea of a pollution-free environment isdifficult for us even to imagine, simply because none of us has ever known anenergy economy that was not highly polluting,’ writes Lester Brown, the founderof Worldwatch Institute, in Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization.‘Working in coal mines will be history. Black lung disease will eventuallydisappear. So too will “code red” alerts warning of health threats from extremeair pollution.’ As an asthma sufferer, I can appreciate this happy by-product.We have the technical ability to make this energy transition, but our time foraccomplishing it is short. Whatever it takes, we must force our globalcivilization to put the brakes on its current momentum, and change its course.This requires a realistic reckoning with the urgency of our situation – farbeyond the voluntary limits set by the 2105 Paris Climate Conference, also knownas the 21st Annual Cooperation of Parties (COP-21), where 195 countries cametogether but were unable to make the UN Framework on Climate Change legallybinding – and a rejection of meaningless half-measures. Let’s take a look atsome of the admittedly wonky details.How Do We Transition?The likelihood that we can make a rapid energy transition keeps growing due totechnical innovations – such as Tesla’s recent development of the Powerwall, astorage battery for renewable sources usable in private homes, or the ongoingdevelopment of the infrastructure for an ‘Internet of Energy’, maximizingefficiency, and allowing people to send extra power back to the grid. Germany isleading the way, particularly with solar. Solar now satisfies around 7 per centof Germany’s electricity needs – but on bright summer days this goes up to above50 per cent. While the percentage of world energy needs supplied by solarremains relatively small, the amount has been doubling annually, revealing thepotential for a rapid, exponential leap.The Solutions Project, founded by Mark Jacobson, Director of the Atmosphere andEnergy Program, Stanford University, mapped out a programme for all 50 US statesto run on 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. This envisions a rapidtransition in energy infrastructure at the state level, with power coming fromnumerous renewable sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric andwave devices. To take the state of New York as an example, the Solutions Projectproposes that 40 per cent of the state’s energy could be generated by offshorewind turbines, with solar photovoltaic plants providing another 35 per cent. Therest would come from a mix of other sources, including solar cells on rooftops.Similarly, in the UK, a report from the Centre for Alternative Technology atMachynlleth, Zero Carbon Britain: Rethinking the Future (2010), proposes thatBritain could completely eliminate fossil fuels in twenty years, through asystemic transition in energy use, production, agriculture and land-usepatterns. The report looks at the policy framework needed to drive such a rapidshift, as well as the technologies and lifestyle changes needed to make it areality. Zero Carbon Britain points to a future where Britain has ‘acknowledgedour historical responsibility as a long-industrialized nation and made ourcontribution to addressing climate change by reducing UK greenhouse gasemissions rapidly to net zero’.Through a coordinated effort and strategy, Britain could decrease greenhouse gasemissions by 95 per cent in two decades. Reductions would be made in every area,including households, business, industry and waste management. These reductionswould depend on significant changes to industrial processes and patterns ofpersonal use, as well as the diversion of waste from landfill, and theconversion of landfill sites to storage silos.The report estimates that Britain could cut its demand for energy by about 60per cent through energy-saving and conservation measures. Without a skilfulmarketing campaign that unites the population behind a common purpose, many ofthe proposed measures would be extremely unpopular – such as reducing the amountthat people travel, as well as limiting the transport and manufacture ofunnecessary goods. Within two decades, the authors point out, all power could begenerated from renewable sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from theenergy sector to zero.The plan calls for reductions in the consumption of meat and dairy, plus changesin land-management practices, dropping CO2 emissions from agriculture by morethan 70 per cent. Another significant change in the British landscape would be adoubling of the area of forest. A larger proportion of this – almost a third –would be left unharvested, enhancing biodiversity and sequestering carbon.‘These changes to the way we use land, the increased area of forest, therestoration of 50 per cent of our peatlands, and the use of more plant-basedproducts made mainly from harvest wood’ would allow Britain to capture about 45million tons of greenhouse pollution every year. According to the report, thissystemic transition would produce millions of new jobs, as the country ‘powersdown’ from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and ‘powers up’ on renewables.In 2011, two American experts, Peter Schwartzman and David Schwartzman, at theInstitute for Policy Research and Development issued a report entitled A SolarTransition is Possible. The Schwartzmans believe that, using current resourcesand known technologies, the world can engineer a complete transition torenewables over the next two or three decades. To achieve this, worldgovernments would have to cooperate to build a new infrastructure that wouldfocus on conservation. Developed countries like the US would agree to reduceenergy usage as much as 25–35 per cent within a matter of years, not decades – afar greater level of reduction than that proposed by COP-21. The Schwartzmans’plan would require demilitarization, since industries related to defence arehuge energy wasters.They propose the construction of a ‘new direct-current (DC) distributionnetwork, as a means for moving solar-generated electricity around the country’.They believe this could be ‘achievable and economically feasible’ by ‘usinggeothermal as base supply, wind at night, solar during the day, and hydropowerat peak hours of need’. Solar, we know, is an intermittent power source.However, this can be compensated for by distributing wind farms and solar arraysacross a wide area, while increasing storage.As the amount of financial capital required to extract energy from the remainingsupplies of fossil fuel continues to increase, the Schwartzmans predict thatrenewable energy will become more attractive as an option. The rise of solarpower in the next decades will drastically decrease the demand for petroleum inthe global economy.Joining a chorus of academic voices, the Schwartzmans conclude that shifting torenewables is achievable, can fulfil the energy needs of humanity and canprovide a higher quality of life for all.Deep DecarbonizationThinking along the same lines, The Sustainable Development Solutions Network, aninitiative of the United Nations, is devising a plan for the entire world toeliminate CO2 emissions over the next few decades. Their 2014 report, Pathwaysto Deep Decarbonization, led by the economist Jeffrey Sachs, focused on 15countries, including the US, UK, Brazil, Japan, China and South Africa.According to the authors, ‘deeply reducing greenhouse gas emissions andachieving socioeconomic development are not mutually exclusive. Robust economicgrowth and rising prosperity are consistent with the objective of deepdecarbonization. They form two sides of the same coin and must be pursuedtogether as part of sustainable development.’While I like the bold outlines of the deep decarbonization approach, I disagreewith the authors in one crucial area. I don’t believe that we can reduce globalemissions – and avert catastrophic climate change – while continuing rapideconomic growth. When the United Nations issued its Sustainable DevelopmentGoals recently, it forecast a 7 per cent annual growth rate, measured by grossdomestic product, or GDP, for developing countries. This seems impossible, ifnot suicidal. At the moment, GDP is increasing at about 2 per cent annually,while global debt is increasing at 7 per cent. Even though a transition to arenewable energy infrastructure can create hundreds of thousands – even millions– of new jobs, a rapid reduction of CO2 emissions to avert climate catastrophewill require strict limits on industrial production and development, at leastduring a transition period. Sachs is well known as a neoliberal economist, aproponent of corporate globalization. I think he wants to avoid the politicallyunpalatable realization that ‘deep decarbonization’ is only possible if wetransition away from the current model of economic growth.To stop our destructive momentum, we must transition our economic paradigm topromote a steady-state system, a ‘degrowth’ model or a ‘post-capitalist’ model,in the near term. I agree with Sachs, as well as the UN’s recent SustainableDevelopment Goals, that we must do this while we enhance the living conditionsof the world’s poor. This requires far more than a reform of the globalfinancial system. It requires a redefinition of many basic terms, such as work,value and happiness. It means we must change our behaviour, both individuallyand as a species.Sachs’s plan proposes three essential strategies: increasing energy efficiencyand conservation, rapidly developing low-carbon sources of electricity, andswitching to them for building, transport and industry. He believes that we canbecome carbon neutral by replacing all of the existing fossil fuel plants togenerate energy from renewable sources, and then we can save an enormous amountof energy through conservation, applying the most efficient technologies inareas like urban design, home construction, transport, industry and so on.The problem is that our current infrastructure was built for an age oflimitless, cheap energy. Some experts, like Vaclav Smil – Bill Gates’s favouritethinker – believe it will take a century, or more, to make the transitionenvisioned by experts like Sachs. Smil pessimistically notes that changing ourfossil-fuel-based system is a ‘gargantuan task’.Our energy infrastructure, including ‘coal mines, oil and gas fields,refineries, pipelines, trains, trucks, tankers, filling stations, power plants,transformers, transmission and distribution lines, and hundreds of millions ofgasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil engines – constitutes the costliest andmost extensive set of installations, networks, and machines that the world hasever built, one that has taken generations and tens of trillions of dollars toput in place’. The annual throughputs include ‘more than 7 billion metric tonsof hard coal and lignite, 4 billion metric tons of crude oil, and more than 3billion cubic meters of natural gas’.It is difficult to conceive of human civilization simply abandoning this massiveconstruction. For Smil, it seems impossible. He also notes that we have not yetproved that carbon-neutral energy sources such as solar can replace fossil fuelsuniversally. However, there is no theoretical reason they can’t be scaled, inthe ways that Sachs and the Schwartzmans suggest. The difficulties in making arapid systemic transition are financial and ideological. There are no physicalconstraints preventing us from doing it. If this transition became a centralfocus of collective human activity over the next few years, we would accomplishit. We do know from the past that ideologies, beliefs, social behaviour – aswell as the economic systems that underlie them – can change quickly.Focusing on averting a two-degree rise in global temperatures, theDecarbonization report warns that ‘without a dramatic reversal of the greenhousegas emissions trajectory – one that leads to a significant decline in greenhousegas emissions by mid-century and to net zero emissions during the second half ofthe century – the world will not only overshoot the 2°C limit, but will do sodramatically . . . Humanity faces catastrophic risks on our current path.’Unfortunately, recent scientific projections have reduced that 2°C limit to1.5°C as the maximum before large-scale release of the methane from the Arcticbecomes inevitable. This only serves to highlight the severity of our currentemergency, and how quickly we must work together to avert the worst possibleresults.The Solar SingularityAlthough solar energy currently supplies only about 1 per cent of electricityglobally, we are on the verge, potentially, of an exponential scaling up ofsolar power. This could happen so rapidly that solar will surpass fossil fuelsas our principal energy source within a few decades. Energy analyst Tam Hunt isamong many commentators who agree we have already reached the tipping pointwhere solar becomes the cheapest source of energy and hence the default source:‘The cost of solar power has plummeted in the last few years by over 50 per centand we are seeing solar power costs at or below the cost of utility power in anincreasing number of jurisdictions already; this is generally known as “gridparity”.’ This is the case, even though fossil fuel companies receive all sortsof government subsidies.A recent report found that Germany, Italy and Spain are now at ‘grid parity’ forsolar photovoltaics, and many other countries are close. Grid parity means it isnow just as cheap to use solar as other sources of energy. According to DeutscheBank, 80 per cent of the world will reach grid parity by 2017. ‘I call the nextbig step for solar after grid parity, the point at which solar power becomes thedefault new power source in a majority of jurisdictions around the world, the“solar singularity”.When this moment is reached, solar power will take off and become the dominantpower source relatively quickly,’ Hunt writes.It is entirely feasible for solar to undergo a very rapid acceleration. Oneprecedent for this is the rapid dissemination and penetration of cell phones andsmart phones, which became ubiquitous more quickly than any past technology inhistory. In the US, the transition from horses to automobiles, early lastcentury, took little more than a decade. If governments support the solarsingularity with new subsidies and policies, solar could indeed become theworld’s dominant energy source within the next decades.The potential for a rapid scaling up of solar power and other renewable sourceshas existed for a while now. Unfortunately, it has been blocked and subverted bygovernments, particularly the US and China. These super-powers have committed tofossil fuels due to entrenched interests and fixed ideologies. But for China, atleast, this is now changing.In 2000, the entire global market for solar power was 300 megawatts a year.Since then, China’s increasing commitment to solar has radically boosted theprospects for the industry: Jeremy Leggett, the founder of Solar Century, a UKcompany, believes we have now reached a point where solar’s triumph isinevitable. Leggett saw the future when he visited a new factory in Shanghai,which can produce a thousand megawatts of solar panels annually. ‘The machinesstretch in ordered rows many football pitches into the distance’, he writes inThe Winning of the Carbon War. ‘Hundreds of workers, dressed just like thetouring party, attend them. A thousand people work under this roof, inalternating shifts, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.’ In 2012, the total capacityof solar photovoltaic panels crossed 100 gigawatts: ‘This is equivalent to . . .65 full-size 1.3 gigawatt nuclear reactors,’ Leggett notes – and solar iscontinuing to grow, exponentially.While China’s totalitarian political system is not enviable as a social model,the Chinese might force a rapid conversion to regenerative practices in manyareas. Instead of making disposable gadgets for the West, factories could berepurposed to produce rainwater harvesters, biochar units, storage batteries forrenewable energy sources and so on. Similarly, China could undertake alarge-scale retraining of its population to adopt conservation as well aspermaculture practices. It could force its population to become essentiallyvegetarian.The massive transition we need to ensure our continuity may be easier to manageunder an authoritarian regime than under a liberal democracy, corrupted byspecial interests. The happiest outcome would be a worldwide metamorphosis, overa few decades, to both decentralized power grids and decentralized democracies.The Internet of EnergyMaking a rapid, global transition to renewable sources of energy requires thedevelopment of enhanced energy-storage capacities and the creation of what somecommentators call ‘The Internet of energy.’ The economic and social theoristJeremy Rifkin outlines this optimistic alternative in his book, The ThirdIndustrial Revolution.Rifkin believes this revolution will be based on a number of factors. Obviously,first and most pressing, is the transition to solar, wind, geothermal, hydro andother renewable sources. Second, we must transform our approach to building, sothat we construct new buildings and retrofit old ones to act as micro-powerplants, collecting energy on-site. The third is developing and deployinghydrogen batteries and other storage technologies to capture the intermittentpower produced from renewable sources. Then, we must develop networktechnologies that transform the power grid of every continent and country intoan ‘energy internet’ able to transmit power efficiently. This would require adecentralized infrastructure, like the Internet itself. Lastly, we musttransition our transportation system – cars, trucks, trains, boats, planes – torun on renewable sources of fuel. We can replace the current fleet of cars withelectric plug-in and fuel cell vehicles – even though this would require atremendous expenditure of energy. There are over a billion cars and truckscurrently on the planet. Retrofitting them to run on electricity – or salt-waterhydrolysis – might be less wasteful than junking them. We also might want torethink the private automobile as our principal mode of transport. A ton ofsteel, raw materials and precious metals to move around one or two human beingsis not very efficient. Cars are difficult to recycle. Once they cease working,they end up in dumps, leaking toxins into the Earth.Rifkin, by the way, followed up his extremely optimistic book, The ThirdIndustrial Revolution, with an even more optimistic one. In The Zero-Margin CostSociety, he argues that humanity may be reaching a threshold wheresuper-abundance becomes our natural state. We will avert the ecological crisisby rapid innovations, spreading sustainable solutions across the Earth throughdistributed manufacturing and open-source, peer-to-peer forms of collaborativeproduction. We will be able to ‘print out’ solar panels and desalinization kits,for instance, ending our dependence on scarce water.Other futurists believe such a direction is plausible if we can overcome ourideological blockages and stop the robots from pulling a Terminator on us. Forinstance, Paul Mason realizes, in Postcapitalism, ‘Knowledge-driven productiontends towards the unlimited creation of wealth, independent of the labourexpended.’ Mason believes we are approaching the potential for a post-capitalistcivilization where a basic income or universal subsidy gives everyone the meansto live decently, where we achieve ‘freedom from work’. Once again, asBuckminster Fuller predicted, we seem to be on a seesaw teetering between polaropposites of utopia or oblivion.Algae-based FuelOne question is whether there are other forms of non-polluting renewable energy– besides solar, wind and geothermal – that we can access, which can speed ourescape from fossil fuel dependence and help us reach carbon-neutral or negative,globally. While solar energy and other renewables could fulfil all sorts ofneeds, they are not effective for certain purposes, for instance air travel. Ittakes an enormous amount of fuel to power the world’s current fleet of jetplanes as well as giant cargo ships.‘One round-trip flight from New York to Europe or to San Francisco creates awarming effect equivalent to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person,’ statesthe New York Times. ‘The average American generates about 19 tons of carbondioxide a year; the average European, 10. So if you take five long flights ayear, they may well account for three-quarters of the emissions you create.’ Forsomeone like myself, who doesn’t drive a car, air travel is my biggest singlecontribution to warming.Through my work, I get many opportunities to hop on a plane, which I love to do– although ironically, my work involves speaking about this very quandary. But Irecognize that travel is a massive drain on the planet’s resources.For those of us in the privileged classes – not only defined by wealth, which Ilack, but access to other forms of capital, such as ‘culture capital’ – ourability to travel freely around the globe, whenever we like, is considered aninalienable right, not something to be judged, censured or questioned. Everyother week, friends of mine jet off to Nepal, Bali, South Africa, Indonesia,Japan, Siberia, Berlin, Costa Rica, Gstaad, expelling several tons of CO2 witheach puddle jump. They visit ski lodges, ancient temples, secluded eco-lodgesand yoga retreats, and take selfies with native tribes sporting theirpicturesque penis gourds.Many of us believe that our ability to descend on distant cultures – whenever wefeel like it – is, somehow, beneficial for the world. We don’t see it as a formof colonialist entitlement, or another addiction. One by-product of thisincessant travel is that wealthy people don’t develop a deeper connection withany particular place. They don’t feel the need to deepen community where theyare. Why should they, when they can always jet off to the next spot, as soon asthings feel dull for them and they desire more stimulation? Perhaps we couldstart with a commitment to travel less, to invest in building community at home?For instance, if one million or ten million or one hundred million people agreedto restrict their air travel to once a year, or less, that could be shown tohave measurable impacts in the amount of CO2 and other waste produced.If people continue to travel by plane all of the time, without regard forconsequences, we are going to have to pray for some amazing, stillunimaginedbreakthrough technologies to arise – technologies that can suck carbon out ofthe atmosphere, and allow us to fly without emitting clouds of doom. Onesomewhat fanciful idea I entertain is the revival of airships – hydrogen-filledblimps (helium, unfortunately, is increasingly scarce). Imagine, particularly ina post-work society organized around the pursuit of what Oscar Wilde called‘cultivated leisure’, airships being used as gigantic co-working and co-housingfacilities, drifting slowly around the world, perhaps even containing someversion of indoor aquaponics farms, producing their own food. They could becomefloating festivals. But I digress.One tantalizing prospect for a new energy source for air travel and other formsof transportation is the use of algae as a source of biofuel. Algae is anon-flowering plant that uses photosynthesis to convert carbon and light intolipids and carbohydrates that can be turned into ethanol. Perhaps the mostimportant organism on Earth, it is a major contributor to the stability, healthand regenerative capacities of the biosphere, producing more than half of theoxygen that we breathe. Algae can be commercially grown in mass quantities, andthen pressed – much the way olives are pressed into olive oil – to produce fuel,which, in theory, can power jet planes, ocean liners, as well as cars and homeheating systems.The path to a regenerative transformation of human society will requireharnessing the restorative capacities of the oldest organisms on Earth, andapplying our industrial techniques to scale up production and distribution. Thiswill include working with plants and fungi, as well as anaerobic microorganismscalled Archaea, ancient one-celled organisms with no nucleus, which can beutilized to transmute our waste products into fuel.A number of companies are currently working on the commercial production ofalgae-based biofuels – and when they perfect the process, it presumably can bescaled up rapidly to be a replacement for fossil fuels on a large level. One ofthese companies, Algae Systems, based in Nevada, makes ‘diesel fuel from algaeby simultaneously performing three other tasks: making clean water frommunicipal sewage (which it uses to fertilize the algae), using the carbon-heavyresidue as fertilizer and generating valuable credits for advanced biofuels’.The technology, according to the company, is carbon negative, removing more CO2from the atmosphere than it releases, but it is still a work in progress.Nuclear PowerCurrently, nuclear energy supplies an estimated 20 per cent of electricity inthe US, and 14 per cent of electricity globally, without releasing CO2. Withoutdismissing other sources of renewable energy, billionaires like Peter Thiel andBill Gates, along with ‘Neo-environmentalists’ like Mark Lynas, Stewart Brandand Ramez Naam, promote nuclear power as a necessity – even after Fukushima.Lynas writes that ‘nuclear power is likely to be the most environmentallyfriendly technology of all, although appropriately sited wind, solar and otherrenewables are similarly benign and should be equally encouraged’. But to createenough power to satisfy the ever-increasing demand, while reducing globalemissions of CO2 by 50 per cent by midcentury, would require the construction of12,000 new nuclear power plants. In other words, one plant would have to comeonline, every single day, for the next 30 years.In Eaarth, Bill McKibben writes, ‘Nuclear power plants don’t seem as scary asthey did a generation ago – not that they’ve gotten safer, but other things havegotten nastier . . . If a nuclear plant has an accident, it’s bad news, but ifyou operate a coal-fired plant exactly according to the instructions, it meltsthe ice caps and burns the forests.’ Nuclear plants are extremely costly tobuild and often involve enormous cost overruns. ‘Bottom line: building enoughconventional nuclear reactors to eliminate a tenth of the threat of globalwarming would cost about $8 trillion,’ McKibben notes, and would run electricityprices ‘through the roof’.Plant safety and nuclear waste disposal remain serious concerns – not to mentionthe potential to turn radioactive byproducts into weapons. In the US, engineersare starting to fret about the potential of the ageing fleet of reactors towithstand the increasingly frequent onslaught of super-storms and earthquakes.Indian Point, near New York, where I live, appears to be leaking radioactivewaste, according to news reports. As peak oil and climate change continues tointensify in the next years, large-scale projects such as building nuclearreactors will become increasingly difficult to implement. The construction of anuclear reactor not only costs several billion dollars, but also adds anestimated 20 million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere.Energy companies are in the process of developing fourth-generation nuclearreactors – including some able to use already existing radioactive waste as fuel– but the technology remains untested and unproven. These new kinds of reactors,according to Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler, could be ‘so-called backyardnukes. These selfcontained small-scale modular generation IV nuclear reactorsare built in factories (for cheaper construction), sealed completely, anddesigned to run for decades without maintenance.’ The timetable for these newreactors is vague, with the potential for a demonstration model of one kind tobe running by 2020.If it can be conclusively demonstrated that next-generation nuclear plants aresafe and will help us stave off global warming, the technology should beconsidered. But the inherent problems with nuclear power remain severe. Even ifthe loss of life from Fukushima and Chernobyl was far less than initiallyfeared, we still don’t know what the long-term, even multi-generational, impactsof this radiation will be. Nuclear reactors cost a fortune to build and requirea massive security infrastructure to protect. They reinforce the current modelof centralized government and corporate control.On the other hand, we know that both solar and wind work. These energy sourcesare getting cheaper faster and they are available now. Solar power has alreadyreached grid parity, and will soon be far more cost-effective than fossil fuels.Renewable energy does not require a huge security apparatus, does not producedangerous waste and can be installed in a decentralized manner. The onlyquestion, in fact, is how do we bring about their immediate adoption?Cold Fusion, Zero PointOther potential energy sources exist. Some of them are controversial and remainon the fringes, but if it can be proved they work reliably without disastrousecological costs, they should be implemented. One of these is cold fusion, alsocalled Low Energy Nuclear Reactors, whose viability is still being studied.According to promoters, cold fusion technology is on the verge of producing‘zero carbon dioxide emissions, zero noise, zero radiation and zero toxins ofany sort. In addition to being powerful and efficient, the technology iscompletely safe. It uses no radioactive materials, produces no nuclear waste,emits no radioactivity into the environment, and releases no pollution.’On the scientific fringe, a number of other researchers believe we can draw anessentially unlimited amount of power by tapping quantum fluctuations from thevacuum, or the zero point field (ZPF). ‘Zero point energy is the sea of energythat pervades all of space and every atom, often called the physical vacuum,’writes Thomas Valone. A tremendous amount of potential energy exists in everyatom of space. According to Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist,‘the energy density of the ZPF would be ten raised to the 108th power joules percubic centimeter’. This translates into the theoretical ability to access enoughenergy to power the world – more than we will ever need – by accessing zeropoint in a tiny region of space.Valone, among others, claims that engines applying zero point are almost readyfor mass release. These engines would make use of the Casimir effect – therepulsion between metal plates at a micro-scale – to produce energy. ‘Analysisof the Casimir engine cycle demonstrates its departure from hydroelectric,gaseous or gravitational systems’, Valone writes.One issue to consider is that, if we did access unlimited free energy from zeropoint or cold fusion before we attained a more advanced planetary consciousness,this might exacerbate other problems. With unlimited power, for instance, wemight rapidly exhaust our resources, plundering the last fish from deep in theoceans, pulling out the remaining raw materials buried deep beneath the Earth.We might also create new super-weapons. The other question, of course, iswhether these two technologies are, in fact, attainable. Mainstream scientistsremain sceptical, but we should stay open to all options. After all, we havealready accomplished many things that were once, simply, unimaginable.Making the Energy TransitionI realize this chapter has included a lot of information. I know your brain mayhave switched off here and there while reading it. I often find, when I speak topeople – non-specialists or non-fanatics – about the ecological mega-crisis, aswell as specific solutions, such as these proposals for global energy (let alonemacro-economics, which is coming up later), they reach a threshold where theireyes glaze over. They stare, vacantly, away from me, into the middle distance.The essential takeaway is that we have a realistic capacity to make a completeoverhaul of our global energy system away from fossil fuels, towards renewables.This doesn’t have to take us a century. We can accomplish it in a few decades.This is not a pie-in-the-sky fantasy. It is something that can happen. Asquickly as we can, we must impel our society in this direction.In fact, nobody can say how fast we might bring this transformation about, onceour focus shifts in this direction. Globally, civilization must break throughpolitical obstructions to engineer a rapid transition to solar and otherrenewable sources, focusing on conservation while we build new infrastructure.Unfortunately, the 2015 Paris agreements on climate change did not do the job –as Naomi Klein noted, COP-21 was ‘scientifically catastrophic’, like telling apatient with heart disease to cut down from five to four hamburgers a day andjog once every two weeks.What humanity needs, as Lester Brown realized, is something like a Marshall Planfor the planet. We must act together as if we are facing a threat as dangerousas Soviet totalitarianism. The threat comes not only from the entrenched powerof the fossil fuel companies, but also from social complacency – as well asconsumerism and hyper-individuality.Roy Scranton writes in Learning to Die in the Anthropocene:The problem with our response to climate change isn’t a problem of passing theright laws or finding the right price for carbon or changing people’s minds orraising awareness. Everybody already knows. The problem is that the problem istoo big. The problem is that different people want different things. The problemis that the problem is us.Scranton is correct. We therefore must seek to engineer a collective shift invalues and behaviour, based on the understanding that individual and collectiveconsciousness are, in the end, socially produced.In the short term, we must radically reduce our use of energy and design andimplement a system based on conservation, cooperation and efficient sharing ofresources. As we will discuss, a ‘carbon tax’ – financially penalizing theproduction of CO2 – might help. However, it won’t be enough. We must engineer astructural transition in our socioeconomic paradigm, away from growth.Smil and other critics are correct in noting that our currentfossil-fuel-dependent energy infrastructure represents a massive globalapparatus, a huge ‘sunk investment’ made over generations. I realize that weconfront a daunting task in switching over to renewable power.Even so, this daunting task can be accomplished. The multitude must demand it,forcing the hands of corporations and governments. This will require a globalmovement of civil society, beyond anything we have seen to date. How such amovement develops – how it organizes itself to overcome the existing powerrelationships – is a question that I don’t think anyone can answer fully at thispoint."},{"pageContent":"5FARMINGCarbon in itself is not our enemy. Carbon is the basis of life itself. Allliving things are carbon-based beings. The problem is the imbalance we havecreated through our ongoing, ever-increasing industrial activity. We must reducethe excess carbon we have already released into the atmosphere, as quickly as wecan.How do we remove CO2 from the atmosphere in large quantities? One of the bestways to accomplish this would be to engineer a coordinated global transitionfrom industrial agriculture back to ecological or organic farming. To do this,we have to reconnect people with an ecologically advanced, locally based, foodsystem. In the US, this means accelerating the ongoing movement away fromsupermarkets, back to farmers’ markets and community supported agricultureprojects, where people buy directly from local farms. In some respects we needto return to older ways and traditions. More of us need to start growing our ownfood.As the authors of ‘Climate Change or System Change?’, a paper produced by theLocal Futures Institute, directed by Helena Norbert Hodge, notes, a lot of tradetoday is redundant, with goods ‘sourced from thousands of miles away when anidentical product is available next door’. Huge supermarket chains contract withmassive industrial farms to stock their stores, ignoring local sources. Britain,for example, ‘imports and exports 15,000 tons of waffles annually, and exchanges20 tons of bottled water with Australia’, while ‘supermarkets on the CitrusCoast of Spain carry imported lemons while local lemons rot on the ground’. Tosave on labour costs, companies will transport produce across the world to beprocessed. For instance, the US company Trident ‘ships about 30 million poundsof fish annually to China for filleting, and then ships the fish back to the USfor sale’.I admit I am one of the billions of alienated city people; I didn’t grow up neara farm and rarely visited one. As a kid, I had no connection to where my foodcame from. I have barely managed to grow a few house-plants, in fifty years oflife.I feel deeply unqualified, therefore, to make proposals when it comes tofarming. I admit my information is based on various reports and second-handsources. I do know how different it feels to eat food grown organically ratherthan commercial produce. I can sense – as everyone can – that the food systemhas become more compromised, and more dangerous, as the Earth’s population hasswelled over the last halfcentury. Allergies, environmental sensitivities andfood intolerances are a growing epidemic.The growth of the organic sector – seen in the rising popularity of Whole Foodsand farmers’ markets – is problematic. Food has become another area where thedivide between ‘Haves’ and ‘Have Nots’ keeps widening. Organic food is generallymuch higher priced, targeting a well-heeled clientele, while ghettos and poorersuburbs remain ‘food deserts’ where the only available food is cheap and lowquality. Worldwide, food is a battleground in the struggle between the developedand developing worlds. Advancing corporate globalization, the World Bank, underUS control, has used subsidies and unfair trade policies that force poorcountries to accept subsidized produce from industrial farms, decimating healthylocal industries.According to estimates, commercial agriculture is one of the main contributorsto climate change. The food industry as a whole generates an estimated 30 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, while the agricultural sectoraccounts for 14 per cent of total global emissions, most of which stem from themeat production industry alone. Livestock cultivation is also responsible fordeforestation, nitrogen runoff and other ills.Much evidence suggests that, if we return to earlier ways of farming, likeno-till agriculture, this will substantially reduce CO2 emissions.Traditionally, farmers will plough, disc or harrow land to form a seedbed forrows of crops, then use a mechanical cultivator to cull weeds. Turning the soilover and over in this way releases carbon dioxide. With no-till agriculture,farmers plant seeds into undisturbed soil. This kind of farming minimizes soilerosion and energy use while retaining water and carbon.According to a 30-year study by the Rodale Institute, ‘Organic farming is farsuperior to conventional systems when it comes to building, maintaining andreplenishing the health of the soil.’ The study estimates that conventionalagriculture produces 40 per cent more greenhouse gases than its organicequivalent. One 2007 study, commissioned by the Pew Center on Global ClimateChange, concluded that organic agriculture had the potential to sequester 11 percent of the emissions for that year if put into practice globally.If it is true that organic, ecological and no-till farming, where appropriate,can be more productive than industrial farming, requiring less artificialfertilizer and polluting pesticides, while sequestering carbon and havingbenefits for human health, then society should make a systemic return to thesepractices. Returning to older, more human-scaled systems will require a greatdeal of retraining, but it can be done. We have the tool we need for it – aplanetary nervous system, in the Internet, that allows for immediatetransmission of new ideas and traditional techniques. As a basic principle ofthe new planetary culture, we will reconnect people to their local ecosystems.We will support them to become gardeners, stewards of the commons (our land andwatersheds), caring for biodiversity and for one another.MeatThere is no doubt that we need a steep reduction of meat consumption to reduceCO2 pollution. Humans kill, process and consume 100 billion creatures per year.Animal farming on this scale depends upon a vast global infrastructure offactory farms and soybean plantations. The amount of grain grown for animal feedis one of the largest contributors to the deforestation that erodes biodiversityand accelerates climate change. Consumption of meat is highly inefficient interms of energy and water use. It requires an estimated 28 calories of energy toproduce one calorie of meat. The meat-based diet of the average person in theUnited States requires an estimated 4,200 gallons of water per day, compared to300 gallons a day for a vegan diet. Thirty per cent of the Earth’s land surfaceis used for animal grazing. A great proportion of this land should be convertedback into carbon-sequestering forests and wetlands.A 2006 report prepared by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organizationfound that our meat-based diets are responsible for emissions of more greenhousegases into the atmosphere than either transportation or industry. According toestimates, the meat produced in factory farms around the world contributesbetween 14 and 22 per cent of the 36 billion tons of CO2, or its equivalent,that is emitted every year by our industrial and agricultural systems.According to the Worldwatch Institute, ‘Serious action on climate change willalmost certainly require reductions in the global consumption of meat and dairyby today’s major consumers in industrial countries, as well as slowing thegrowth of demand in developing countries.’ One way to bring about thisreduction, they propose, is to put ‘a price on livestock-related greenhousegases, so that producers treat them as a business cost and thus have a directincentive to reduce them’. Beyond enforcement through financial or legal means,an engineered shift in mass consciousness will be necessary to reduce ortemporarily eliminate meat consumption.Would it really be so bad if humanity put a moratorium on the consumption ofmeat as well as wild fish for a period of time, in order to allow the Earth toreplenish and restore itself? A ‘global meat fast’ would be one of the fastestways for us to make a significant dent in emissions, quickly.While I know that some of you reading this are already vegetarian, I also knowthat many of you have contemplated it, perhaps attempted it, and decided it‘wasn’t worth it’. Personally, I have been largely vegetarian for the lastyears, although I admit I fall off the wagon at times, depending on who I amdining with as well as other factors, including laziness and boredom. In manyareas, I find myself a helpful test case, because I am typically slothful, slowto change, and not particularly good at maintaining habits. In all this, I amprobably representative of many well-intentioned people.My friends Sharon Gannon and David Life are ardent and exemplary vegans formoral reasons. For Sharon, animals are actually ‘people’ who deserve all thesame rights as us. She has even written a book on how to prepare vegetarian petfood. I admit that I can’t feel as passionate about this as she does. I tend tothink that humans were designed to be omnivores; hunting beasts in the wild wasa basic and essential part of life for a very long time. In the end, everythinglives, eats and dies, and gets recycled by nature.Having said that, however, I do find factory farming to be morallyreprehensible. Like many of us, I consider the conditions so many animals faceto be horrible. They are sentient beings that suffer misery and torture, ahellish existence.Traditional people felt a deep relatedness to animals and all of nature. As JackForbes writes of Native American culture, in Columbus and the Cannibals:When a plant, tree or animal is to be killed, first, the need must be great;second, permission is asked for, if time allows; third, the creature is thanked;and, fourth, dances, prayers and ceremonies are used to further thank thecreatures so killed and to help those that are alive to grow and prosper.Indigenous people ask for permission to take an animal’s life, and expressgratitude for its sacrifice. Our meat comes from mass, mindless slaughter. Iadmit I also find something off-putting about our potential for creatingbio-engineered vat-grown meat, although I can see why people would consider itan ethical advance over this endless global genocide.We can all agree that animal farming is a multi-dimensional ecologicalnightmare. It causes deforestation, nitrogen runoff, CO2 pollution and theoveruse of antibiotics and so on. It is mass torture and degradation. If we havea spiritual viewpoint, we may believe this mass suffering has karmicrepercussions – not only for those directly involved with it, and those whoconsume its products, but also for our society as a whole. Considering all thefactors, a global transition towards a primarily vegetarian diet seems the onlyanswer for humanity. If we want to be stewards and midwives of the globaltransition, then we should lead the way by making this shift, personally.Beyond any personal commitments, we need a broad-based social movement promotingvegetarianism and veganism. A global campaign, using cutting-edge techniques ofadvertising and marketing, could educate people, asking them to give up meat forour children’s future. Can we imagine the world’s advertising, marketing andbranding agencies joining forces for this project? I don’t see why not: ourfuture depends on it. We then must consider how such a project could be fundedand supported.What Can We Do?Even in the best scenario we can envision, humanity is going to be dealing witha drastically destabilized climate over the next century. This will cause morefloods, super-storms, droughts and so on. Growing food locally, using organicmethods, is one of the best ways to make our society more resilient, helping toinsulate communities from possible disaster in case supply chains get disrupted.It will also reduce transport, plastic packaging and CO2 pollution.In agriculture, as in many areas, the best solutions can be implemented fast ifwe make use of mass media and social networks to spread good ideas globally.This is already happening on a small scale. People learn how to sprout, pickleor can vegetables from YouTube videos or online courses. Progressiveorganizations like Bioneers – which has an annual conference in the Bay Area –have been promoting best practices for decades. Permaculture and gardeningtechniques can be taught through the Internet and even on mainstream TV shows,telling people what’s happening while giving them the tools to help the world aswell as themselves.Sustainable technologies could be deployed on a global scale to accelerate soilregeneration and carbon sequestration. One of these technologies is biochar,which scientists learned about when they studied the ecological practices oftribal people in the Amazon jungle. Natives would burn organic waste slowly, inan oxygen-weak environment, and then use the residue to replenish local soil,adding carbon back to the Earth. Biochar is the industrialized version of thisancient practice. According to Mark Hertsgaard, ‘If Biochar were added to 10percent of global cropland . . . it would store 20 billion tons of CO2equivalent’ – that is more than 50 per cent of humanity’s annual greenhouse gasemissions. I don’t know why we are not doing this already.To break through current obstacles to changes in farming, a movement of civilsociety must build global alliances. The progressive and environmental communitymust partner with global institutions – for example, with the Catholic Church.Considering Pope Francis’s environmental outlook in his encyclical, Care for theEarth, there should be a way to follow through on his principles and use theglobal network of Catholic churches as a ready-made social infrastructure forthe transformation of farming. The community of the faithful could be trained inecologically restorative and permaculture techniques, rooted in localconditions. Tangible ways to ‘Care for the Earth’ could be taught after theSunday sermon, and in Catholic schools.Over the last century, farm work became devalued as rural populations wereforced to relocate to urban areas and find jobs in industrial manufacturing orthe growing service sector. Where most people in the US were farmers a centuryago, now only a small fraction of people work on farms. A great deal of our foodis produced through industrialized agriculture, by big companies. We need torestore social prestige to farming and gardening and support people in growingon urban rooftops and in suburban yards at least some of the food they eat.Designing agricultural systems that are decentralized and specialized would helpto maintain and enhance the ecological and genetic diversity that is essentialto the health of an ecosystem. Current megafarms could, in theory, be dividedinto smaller, specially designed ecological, permaculture and agroforestryprojects built around the contours, water availability and environmental qualityof their sites. Smaller farms could be integrated into larger cooperatives,where social support, hardware and labour could be shared by the farmers.Cuba’s forced transition, in the 1990s, to a regenerative agricultural system inthe face of crisis offers an encouraging model. After 1989, the country wasforced to produce its own food due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, whichcut off Cuba’s main subsidies and supplies. Under great pressure to innovate,the Cubans developed a local food system that incorporated urban gardening andmade it mandatory for most of the population to grow some of their own produce.Inadvertently, they created a model for self-sufficiency that could bereplicated, particularly in the global South.High- and Low-tech InnovationHopefully, we will see a growing movement away from industrial agriculture andthe destructive aspects of the ‘Green Revolution’ towards ecological practicesthat will democratize food production and make organic food the normal standardagain, eventually. Many different techniques can be applied, depending onparticular circumstances.These include permaculture, agroforestry, poly-cropping and so on. There aremany ways we can assist nature in regenerating damaged and despoiled lands. Themycologist Paul Stamets uses mushrooms – fungus – to leach toxins out of thesoil. Allan Savory’s method of cattle grazing reverses desertification ongrasslands. Many other techniques of bioremediation can be applied, depending oncircumstances.Permaculture was developed by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in the late1970s. The name stands for ‘permanent agriculture’ or ‘permanent culture’ – Ihave to admit, I’m not crazy about the term because nothing in nature ispermanent. The term ‘permaculture’ has a built-in ideological bias, suggesting akind of hippie Fundamentalism. However, as a design science applied toagriculture, permaculture offers many crucial ideas and insights.One central principle of permaculture is to observe the land before interactingwith it. Studying the local ecology and water sources, permaculturists seek tounderstand what kind of development meshes with a site’s innate contours andrequirements, rather than making it conform to an abstract model. Instead ofimmediate profit, the objective is longterm resilience. A permaculture designerwill ideally observe an area of land for a year before making any interventionsor changes to it.Permaculture is based on a number of beautiful and sensible principles. Theseinclude: ‘Observe and interact’; ‘use and value diversity’; ‘creatively use andrespond to change’; and ‘use edges and value the marginal’. Implementingpermaculture requires a long-range investment of attention, effort and care,along with significant training. Permaculture advocates say that, given time,they can produce a much greater yield of food – several times as much – thancommercial farms, while building topsoil; they can accomplish all this withoutusing chemical poisons. Once again, it is important to realize that thisapproach – which seeks to build enduring reciprocity between human beings andtheir environment – requires a good deal of education, patience and carefulattention. Even so, it is entirely feasible for our society to shift its focusin this direction; our future survival depends on supporting and enabling peopleto replenish the health of the Earth’s ecosystems.Some version of agroforestry has been practised by traditional societies forthousands of years. These cultures grow crops in a manner that mimics theinteracting layers of a diverse, healthy forest. Examples can still be seen inthe Western Ghats of rural India, on small-scale farms in Indonesia, andthroughout the tropics. While agroforestry does not sequester as much carbon asold-growth forests, it helps to preserve forests by creating a buffer aroundthem. Like permaculture, agroforestry is based on deep local knowledge andartisanal attention, rather than chemicals or machines.Some developing countries with scarce resources are already being forced toadapt to climate change. They are innovating and creating new models. MarkHertsgaard visited one of these farming communities in the western Sahel ofAfrica. The Sahel is a strip of savanna south of the Sahara desert which‘stretches like a belt across the width of the African landmass’, marked byrelentless heat. Hertsgaard learned that farmers in the region had begun toadapt their practices to deal with climate change. He was amazed by what hediscovered:Using simple techniques that cost them nothing, millions of small farmersthroughout the region have begun protecting themselves against the scorchingheat and withering drought of climate change. Their methods amount to a poorman’s version of organic farming: fortifying soil with manure rather thanchemical fertilizer, growing different crops on the same piece of land (known asintercropping), relying on natural predators to counter pests rather thanapplying pesticides. In the process, farmers in the western Sahel haverehabilitated millions of acres of degraded savanna that was on the verge ofbecoming desert, thus increasing the amount of land available to grow food.The success of this enterprise depends on the straightforward solution ofplanting and growing more trees in the fields. The practice of mixing trees andcrops is called farmer-managed natural regeneration. ‘The trees’ shade and bulkoffer crops relief from the overwhelming heat and gusting winds . . . Leavesserve other purposes. After they fall to the ground, they act as mulch, boostingsoil fertility; they also provide fodder for livestock in a season when littleother food is available.’ In emergency famine conditions, people can also eatthe leaves to stave off starvation.Due to tree-planting initiatives in the region, water reserves have increasedlocally, to the surprise of scientists. According to one agriculture scientist,with the propagation of these simple techniques since the late 1980s, ‘watertables in many villages have risen by at least five meters, despite a growingpopulation’. If this is possible in the extreme conditions of sub-SaharanAfrica, similar initiatives might have tremendous benefits in other water-scarceregions, such as, for example, California.These are low-tech methods that could help us greatly, but there are alsohigh-tech methods that could be crucial. For instance, let’s consider verticalfarms. Inventor Dickson Despommier has developed the concept of vertical farmsfor cities. He envisions the construction of 30-storey towers able to feed50,000 people, in climate-controlled, pest-free environments requiring minimaluse of water. One acre of a vertical farm could yield as much produce as 10 or20 acres of land, he believes, through optimizing conditions and carefulmonitoring. Benefits of vertical farming would include year-round cropproduction, elimination of agricultural runoff from fertilizers, promotion ofurban sustainability, and returning farmland to nature. Why don’t we try this?We can also reduce food waste significantly. According to Anna Lappe, of theSmall Planet Institute, we waste as much as 30 per cent of all food that weprocess, because the current system is inefficient. When food waste is notcomposted, it releases methane as it decays. ‘We know how to grow food in waysthat cut emissions, create more resilient landscapes and ensure ample yields,all while reducing the use of non-renewable resources, fossil fuels, and land,’Lappe writes.To make a systemic transition in farming practices worldwide, we would have tosearch out the most successful local initiatives, isolate the principles andtechniques that make them work, then turn them into design templates that otherlocalities can use and duplicate, in ways appropriate for their particularconditions. The Internet project Open Source Ecology provides one example. Theproject is ‘developing a set of open source blueprints for the Global VillageConstruction Set – a set of the 50 most important machines that it takes formodern life to exist – everything from a tractor, to an oven, to a circuitmaker’. Conceived by Marcin Jakubowski, a fusion physicist turned farmer, OpenSource Ecology offers detailed blueprints and plans for building farm machinerysuch as tractors and mechanical ploughs. The designs of these machines areavailable, copyright free, to anybody who wants to build their own versions intheir workshop.I love projects like this one, where knowledge and expertise is freely shared.Another one is Windowfarm. Windowfarm’s website defines it as ‘An Open SourceCommunity Developing Hydroponic Edible Gardens for Urban Windows’. Windowfarmbuilds systems for growing plants and vegetables out of plastic water bottlesand other household objects. They share the blueprints for their systems on thewebsite, so that other people can copy and improve on their designs.Another model that can be copied is the ‘polyface’ agriculture system, designedby Virginia farmer Joel Salatin. Salatin developed ‘a symbiotic, multi-speciatedsynergistic relationship-dense production model that yields far more per acrethan industrial models’, while ‘being aromatically and aesthetically romantic’.According to Salatin, ‘We haven’t bought a bag of chemical fertilizer in half acentury, never planted a seed, own no plow or disk or silo – we call thosebankruptcy tubes.’ Salatin’s farm proves it is possible to develop closed-loopfarming methods that are innately regenerative and resilient. Such methods couldbecome widely distributed.Even though we must reduce our consumption of animals globally, there are waysthat farms benefit from integrating livestock, on a small scale. This includesmaking use of animal waste. Manure can be transformed into compost, on-site.Methane can be harvested from cow manure and turned into electricity, fuel andheat. Compost from manure can also be spread on grazing land to sequester carbonand enhance soil fertility. According to the Marin Carbon Project (2013), addinga half-inch-thick layer of compost to half of the current cattlegrazing land inCalifornia would mitigate an amount of carbon equal to the region’s entireemissions of greenhouse gases.Genetic EngineeringAnd then there is the genetic engineering (GE) in agriculture debate. Themanipulation of the DNA of crops and other organisms to enhance their utilityfor human purposes remains a highly controversial, polarizing subject. While theUnited States leads the world in pushing for mass adaptation of GE crops, morethan sixty countries, including those of the European Union, continue toprohibit or severely restrict the production and sale of genetically modifiedorganisms (GMOs).According to its proponents, which include neo-environmentalists and technocratslike Bill Gates, GE is necessary to feed the world’s growing population. Geneticmanipulation, they argue, can accomplish a number of crucial goals. Byintegrating insect-resilient and pesticideresistant genes with plant DNA, it canreduce use of pesticides. Plants can also be engineered to be resistant todrought. Fertilizer is used to supply nitrogen to the soil, a nutrient thatplants need to grow but one that is scarce in nature. Only a few beans andlegumes create their own nitrogen – ‘fixing’ nitrogen in the soil. Potentially,through GE, many other crops may be able to produce nitrogen. Nitrogen runoff isalso a major ecological problem, one of the nine planetary boundaries defined bythe Stockholm Resilience Centre.One major problem with GE, under the current system, is that its commercialdevelopment and application is controlled by a few forprofit corporations, whogain by increasing the sales of chemicals and ‘terminator seeds’ (seeds thatmust be bought anew each season, because they don’t germinate), making farmersdependent on biotechnology. These companies also profit by being able tocopyright genetic material and gain monopoly control over seed stocks.At the same time, biotechnology and synthetic biology – the ability to createentirely new organisms – has become a technology available even to hobbyists andgarage start-ups. The global community of biotechnology entrepreneurs recentlylaunched a Kickstarter campaign ‘to develop plants that glow, potentiallyleading the way for trees that can replace electric street lamps and pottedflowers luminous enough to read by’, noted the New York Times. GE seems to be agenie that has got out of the bottle. When I consider the unforeseenconsequences of previous technological advances, I find this truly frightening.There are many unknowns involved in transgenic crops. They may degradebiodiversity. They may have other negative impacts on human and ecosystemhealth, over generations. We simply don’t know.Paul Kingsnorth, founder of the Dark Ecology movement in the UK, believes ourdependence on increasingly advanced technologies has created what he calls aprogress trap: ‘Each improvement in our knowledge or in our technology willcreate new problems, which require new improvements. Each of these improvementstends to make society bigger, more complex, less human-scale, more destructiveof nonhuman life, and more likely to collapse under its own weight.’ Moretroubling than the foreseeable problems are the unforeseeable ones.We have already seen examples of this with GMOs. Some GE crops produce higheryields at first, but this leads the insect population to mutate as well, andwithin less than a decade, those gains can be eliminated or even reversed. Thisis similar to what the medical field has experienced with antibiotics, which arebecoming less and less effective over time. If we keep trying to wage an armsrace against nature, we will lose, because nature has been at this for billionsof years longer than us.We currently have an irrational system driven by market imperatives. The worldoverproduces food but wastes a great deal of it, while some countries facemalnutrition and famine. It would be far more sensible to address theinefficiencies of the current system, which causes so much unnecessarysuffering, before we seek to engineer new life forms which may degradeecosystems – and have negative consequences that we can’t even foresee –generations into the future.GE may be contributing to the increase of allergies, food intolerances and drugresistances, which seem epidemic. Is there a correlation between thesesyndromes, as well as proliferating cancers and other maladies, with GMOs, aswell as herbicides such as glyphosate that saturate genetically engineeredplants? It may be so – but it might take decades, or more, to establish ascientific consensus. Millions of people may suffer and die in the interim, aswe continue to degrade the health of our ecosystems. It took decades to linkcancer to tobacco use. During that time, millions of people died from lungcancer and emphysema. The same difficulty makes it impossible to link anyparticular ‘superstorm’ or natural disaster to CO2 emissions and climatedestabilization. Our scientific method is failing us here.To consider one of many examples of how GE could negatively impact on naturalsystems, geneticists are now developing new strains of a tobacco plant that areable to photosynthesize with much greater efficiency than normal varieties.Plants capable of ‘turbocharged photosynthesis’ would have a tremendousadvantage over other plant species. They could proliferate in the wild, wipingout native species.We are falling prey to the blind hubris of scientists and profit-seekingcorporations.In its fixation on linear growth, our industrial techno-culture – thetechnological society – makes the mistake of separating the world into separate,atomized parts, rather than seeking to understand, and enhance, the hiddenconnections between them. By altering the basic material of life, biotechnologyhas the potential to damage the complex ecosystems upon which we rely.Ecosystems developed over millions of years. Profit-seeking corporations thinkin terms of decades at the most.On the other hand, we are facing a global ecological emergency, and iftemperatures rise quickly, we may need rapid innovations in agriculture. Ifgeneticists could engineer new heat- and droughtresistant crops, as well asvegetables able to store nitrogen in their roots (something that only a handfulof legumes and beans do naturally), we might need these breakthroughs, asclimate change intensifies.Ideally, civil society as a whole should take control of genetic research out ofthe hands of publicly traded corporations. This research should be conductedtransparently, as a public trust, based on an ongoing exchange. This wouldrequire a systemic change in the relationship of public policy and science. Apeople’s movement is needed to take the initiative to learn about subjectsimpacting on all of our lives that we have mistakenly left to the ‘experts’.Biologists now recognize that life is characterized, at all levels, by web-likenetworks of organization. An organism cannot exist in a vacuum, but depends uponits environment. Any living being is, essentially, the organism plus theenvironment which sustains it. Stewart Brand is promoting the idea of‘deextinction’, taking the genetic material from long-dead species like thewoolly mammoth – as well as the millions of species we are currently driving outof existence – and using it to recreate these organisms in the laboratory. But,unless we also rebuild the ecosystems that mesh with these organisms, this seemslittle more than an eerie museum exercise. The better plan is to focus onconserving the species we have now.Transforming the Food SystemJust as we must build a decentralized system for producing energy from renewablesources that will make local communities more selfsufficient and less wasteful,we should establish a new global model for agriculture which is locally based,distributed, cooperative, and healthier for people and the planet.While farmers’ markets and community supported agriculture programmes take rootand flourish, urban gardens could, theoretically, be established in every city,using vacant lots, suitable rooftops, parks and greenways. I have interviewedexperts who believe that 80 per cent of the food needed by New York City couldbe grown on the rooftops using aquaponic methods.Multinational corporations like Monsanto, as well as ‘philanthrocapitalist’organizations like the Gates Foundation, promote the rapid scaling up of theGreen Revolution. They believe the answer to feeding the world’s still-growingglobal populace is to amp up industrial agriculture while we double down ourbets on still-experimental technologies like GE. What we can do, instead, ismake an intentional shift to local, ecological farming, using organic, no-tilland permaculture techniques, as appropriate. A drastic curtailing of meat eatingwill reduce emissions, and return grazing lands to forests. A global campaigncould educate and inspire people to change their behaviour for futuregenerations.We can change our approach to agriculture by subsidizing farmers to embracemethods such as permaculture; we can retrain the public to become part-timegardeners, to see themselves as stewards of their local bioregions. While it maysound difficult to bring about an evolution of cultural values, as well as aparadigm shift in how society operates, the result would be incrediblybeneficial for humanity, on all levels."},{"pageContent":"6INDUSTRYWhat we now call ‘poverty’ is essentially a result of modern industrialcivilization and colonialism. Before the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,most indigenous and traditional societies knew how to operate within the limitsimposed by their local environment. Then capitalism, with its developingtechnology, shattered the integrity of intact cultures, forcing them to growbeyond their means, to become dependent on foreign powers and industries. TakeHawaii, for instance: it was once a fertile, self-sufficient paradise. NowHawaii imports something like 90 per cent of its food and exports nearly all ofits waste. The same process has taken place all over the planet. We must reverseit.In our current economic system, profit is generated by everincreasing commercialactivity. Because it is based on debt and inherently unstable, our economicsystem must grow constantly just to maintain itself. Our industrial system has aparasitic relationship with the Earth’s natural systems. In essence, we generatewealth by subtracting from the Earth’s natural capital.Over the last decades, vast areas of the developing world, such as China andIndia, have adopted the Western model of industrial growth. These huge societiesare beginning to come up against hard limits on their natural resources, muchlike the rest of the world. The challenge for us – the privileged elite in thehighly industrialized societies, who have the leisure time to think about thisstuff – is to develop a new model of industrial production, based onregenerative principles, then distribute it globally.CorporationsFor a corporation to survive, it must keep selling more and more goods andservices, increasing its market share and profit margins. Therefore, itsproducts – from electronic goods to sneakers to IKEA furniture – must bedisposable and replaceable. They must be designed to last just long enough sothat the consumer will be willing to replace them with the next new models,without getting so annoyed that they change brands. The system forces excessiveover-production – and not just for corporations. For individual entrepreneurs,creative artists or designers to survive in this system, we must constantlyproduce new things – books, jewellery, toys, snazzy clothes, DVDs – that onlyadd to the burden under which the Earth is already groaning.We find ourselves in a bind created by our economic system. While somecorporations actively promote initiatives aimed at sustainability and socialresponsibility, these efforts inevitability fall short of what is actuallyneeded for real resilience. Publicly traded corporations, even the ones withgood intentions, are programmed to generate waste and externalize environmentalcosts.The rapid development of a world-encompassing ‘technosphere’ appears to havebeen a natural extension of the potential of our species – a necessary stage inour evolution. In fact, most people believe that our industrial system hasprovided extraordinary benefits, improvements in health and lifestyle, forbillions of people. When it works properly, the technosphere functions like ahyper-organic extension of our bodies. What do I mean by this? Let’s take anexample.When I visit my local cafe in the East Village, I find myself at the end pointof vast, intermeshed systems of agriculture, manufacturing and transport; globalnetworks of trade routes, supply lines, communications and financial data. Thebeans used to make my coffee come from Sumatra, Guatemala or Brazil. The cupmight have been made in China. The oil used to transport the beans may have comefrom Russia or Alaska. In other words, the entire world is involved in theseemingly ordinary act of buying a morning coffee – an act we usually performunthinkingly.The invisibility of these vast networks that produce the objects of our dailylives is akin to the invisible cellular mechanisms that operate all of the timewithin our bodies, that maintain us in good working order. We don’t have tomeditate on our follicles for our hair to grow, or concentrate on our hearts inorder to keep them beating. We are continuously sustained in our existences byvast realms of the invisible and the unseen, by networks of coordination allaround us and by cellular processes within, although we generally onlyconsciously recognize our dependence on these processes when they break down.If it is true that we are on the cusp of realizing ourselves as a planetarysuper-organism, continuously reshaping the Earth, according to our collectivewill and intention, then we must also think of corporations in a different way –as the most powerful creations we have woven out of our social technologies.A corporation is constructed of legal code, financial data, branding insignia,mission and vision statements. In the abstract, a corporation is a streamlined,hyper-efficient engine for taking ideas and transforming them into materialform, then distributing those tools, products and services across the world, athigh speed. The world-spanning successes of companies like Apple, Nike, IKEA andSamsung are a testament to that power.Corporations can be seen as the nascent organs in the collective body ofhumanity. An energy company functions like the circulatory system, spreadingblood – fuel, electrical power – through the body. A sanitation company is likethe liver or kidney. A media company is like the organs of perception which takein sense data, decode it and transmit it to the brain, so it can make decisions.Corporations are artificial life forms that human beings have created andprogrammed, giving them sets of rules they must follow. We have built theseartificial life forms to compete in a game that we also concocted, called thestock market. Like the sorcerer’s apprentice in Fantasia, whose misuse of aspell creates a situation where he has to fight off brooms multiplying toinfinity, we have lost control over our creations.The problem is that we made mistakes, errors of design, in the way we definedthe rules of our game. We gave the corporations one prime directive: to increaseshareholder value, to maximize profit, which they will try to accomplish, nomatter what. In this sense, you can’t totally blame a company like BritishPetroleum for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill (although we can still hold itsmanagers culpable), or Occidental for the atrocities it has committed in theEcuadorean Amazon, or Dupont for the Bhopal disaster, or Apple for usingconflict minerals that unleashed African genocide, or H&M for its exploitationof adolescent girls and young women in Asian sweatshops.When you give the corporation the single directive to maximize profit, then thatis what it will seek to do, even if it means undermining ecologicalrestrictions, condemning workers to slave conditions, or buying armies oflobbyists to corrupt the legislative process to its advantage. We programmed itsunderlying system, its game machinery, so that it must seek to dominate andgrow. This often requires cutthroat tactics. It leads naturally tomonopolization, cronyism and patterns of behaviour that make sense for acorporation’s balance sheet but are destructive, sociopathic, for society as awhole. Glaring examples include the ways that tobacco companies obscured theevidence on lung cancer, or how energy companies have used massive campaigns ofdisinformation to hide the link between climate change and CO2, which they mayhave known about for a number of decades. Now, for the sake of our survival, wemust change the underlying rules of the game.If we conceive of humanity as a planetary super-organism, then we must considerhow the organs of a body work with maximum efficiency to support the health ofthe whole. If corporations are the organs of the super-organism, then theyshould be reinvented as transparent orchestrations, responding to ecologicalnecessity as well as human desire. When I project into the future, I tend tothink we will need to abandon the distinctions between a public and privatesector, eventually. There is no private interest within an organism: it mustfunction efficiently, according to a unified intention. As a superorganism, wemust do the same.It is possible that the ongoing movement towards collaborative production thatis open-source and peer-to-peer could provide the new social model for ourfuture. As Paul Mason writes in Postcapitalism, we are experiencing anincreasing tension between ‘non-market forms of production’ and traditionalcapitalism. ‘Technologically, we are headed for zero-price goods, unmeasurablework, an exponential takeoff in productivity and the extensive automation ofprocesses. Socially, we are trapped in a world of monopolies, inefficiency, theruins of a finance-dominated free market and a proliferation of “bullshitjobs”.’ The potential, Mason believes, is for ‘the abolition of the market andits replacement by postcapitalism’. If this is going to happen without massivedislocation and mass violence, it requires a designed transition.People will always require goods and services, but these could be provided forthem by a new social infrastructure, based on peer-to-peer systems fordistributed manufacturing and resource sharing. Through an intentional redesignof our financial system, corporations could ‘evolve’ into self-governing systemsbased on open cooperation and resource sharing, designed to bring universalabundance. They would maximize our potential as a species, while minimizingwaste and internalizing externalities, such as CO2 emissions.Innovation or Transformation?In The Big Pivot: Radically Practical Strategies for a Hotter, Scarcer, and MoreOpen World, Andrew Winston looks at climate change and resource depletion asopportunities for businesses to evolve their practices without sacrificing theirbottom line. Optimistically quoting billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson,who has described climate change as ‘one of the greatest wealth-generatingopportunities of our generation’, Winston sees the ecological limits as newstimuli that will ‘propel innovation, new thinking, and new business models,which make a lot of money for the fast movers’. This is true, up to a point.Winston outlines a number of strategies that will enable companies to navigatein a rapidly warming and ecologically deteriorating world. These include ‘fightshort-termism’, ‘set science-based goals’ and ‘inspire customers to use less’.He reviews the ecological data honestly, and advises companies to build inresilience, redundancy and other safeguards against increasing instability,making it clear that the landscape for industry will be radically transformed inthe coming decades: ‘Most companies and industrial sectors will changeprofoundly, or they will disappear. Without a “clean-coal” technologicalmiracle, for example, the coal sector will be gone.’The Great Pivot seeks to assure corporations that they can reinvent themselvesfor increasing profitability, even in a time of tumultuous transformation.‘Revamping our built environment, our transportation infrastructure, and ourenergy systems – as well as reworking consumption and what defines a goodquality of life – will be multitrillion- dollar endeavours with huge pots ofgold for those who find the greenest ways to do it.’Some corporations, like Unilever, portray themselves as leaders in this newtransitional space. They study patterns of consumer behaviour, and build modelson how these habits can be changed. However, the reality is that we require morethan innovation in how businesses function. Fundamentally to transform thecorporate system, mass consumerism and planned obsolescence must be replaced bydifferent models. Eventually, we can generate abundance for all throughregenerative technologies and cradle-to-cradle industries. This metamorphosisrequires a paradigm shift in how value is exchanged, not just in how businessoperates.The UN recently defined a new set of Sustainable Development Goals. Many ofthese goals are laudable – but there is a problem. One of the goals is‘sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productiveemployment, and decent work for all’, hopefully resulting in a 7 per cent annualgrowth in the economies of the developing world. Unfortunately, considering ourmaxed-out resources and accelerating climate catastrophe, this seems impossibleand even suicidal.When I rack my brain for solutions to our current crisis, I keep returning tothe belief that we must give up on the current model of sustainable development,based on ever-increasing GDP. At the same time, we can’t give up the project ofenhancing the lives of people in poor countries and regions. Our goal should beto establish human beings in healthy regional communities that will be asselfreplenishing, resilient and autonomous as possible. Rather than seeking tofix a broken system, we need to design the transition to a postcapitalistsociety based on open-source, peer-to-peer collaboration, where everyonereceives a basic income and shares scarce resources intelligently.Development, by its nature, requires ever more inputs of energy and resources.Degrowth – a social and economic movement, launched in France – proposes that wereduce the scale of our activity in accordance with the limits of the planet. Wewould focus innovation on building systems that allow us ‘to live conviviallyand frugally’. But how can we implement the model of degrowth? How do we reach aform of postcapitalism that completely contradicts the currentpolitical-economic system?The Story of StuffIn Capitalism and the Destruction of Life on Earth, originally published onAlternet, the left-wing critic Roger Smith argues persuasively that ourcapitalist industrial system is in a doom-spiral:The engine that has powered three centuries of accelerating economic developmentrevolutionizing technology, science, culture and human life itself is today aroaring, out-of-control locomotive mowing down continents of forests, sweepingoceans of life, clawing out mountains of minerals, drilling, pumping out lakesof fuels, devouring the planet’s last accessible resources to turn them all into‘product’ while destroying fragile global ecologies built up over eons.Smith sees our technical infrastructure as directly responsible for the crisiswe have unleashed. It is hard to argue with him.This much seems obvious: we are mortgaging our future to maintain anunsustainable, suicidal system, hyper-focused on maximizing shortterm gains forshareholders. Even the best companies are guilty. Take IKEA, for instance. TheSwedish company recently earmarked one billion dollars for climate changeinitiatives, which seems to suggest that they care. But IKEA’s practices are, inthemselves, environmentally destructive, and this massive bequest is also PR forthem.IKEA is the third-largest consumer of wood in the world, logging out forestsfrom East Europe and Siberia. IKEA clear-cuts 1,400 acres per year of 200- to600-year-old forest near the Finnish border, despite the protests of conservancygroups. IKEA succeeds by using the cheapest means of mass production, buildingdisposable furniture out of particle-board, rather than durable, long-lastingitems. Its business model – like that of almost every major corporation – isbased on the ideal of producing disposable goods that must be frequentlyreplaced. Planned obsolescence and extreme waste is built into the logic oftheir system.As you may already know, the mining of rare materials for our smart phones andother disposable electronic goods has caused ecological and social disaster inWest Africa, in the Congo and neighbouring countries. An estimated three millionhave died in wars and genocides fought over control of ‘conflict minerals’, tosatiate the world’s lust for these seductive gadgets. When Western colonialistsdiscovered sugar, the entire European continent became addicted to the stuff.They created the slave trade to make sure they had a steady supply of it. Today,we are equally addicted to our electronic gadgets, and equally unconscious aboutthe suffering we cause by our addictions. In some ways, nothing has changed.The disposal of electronic goods is another environmental nightmare. Much of ourtrash ends up in dumps in the developed world, where it disintegrates, leachingtoxins into the soil. We can’t continue these practices. Our culture reveresSteve Jobs, posthumously, as a saint of technology, a kind of digital messiah.He was a brilliant man, but he was not a great humanitarian. He knew what washappening in West Africa – as well as in Asian factories with terribleconditions, where teenage labourers often committed suicide – but he didn’t makeit his mission to stop it. He allowed this destruction and misery to continue,because it fed Apple’s profits.Our industries currently threaten most forms of life on Earth. ‘At present,global manufacturing and production processes consume more than 220 billion tonsof resources annually, all taken from the Earth’s “natural capital” – oceans,forests, plants, plains, soils, mines, and all other aspects of biodiversity,’note the editors of Alternatives to Economic Globalization, put together byJerry Mander. Our current form of accounting considers depletion of naturalresources ‘beneficial to gross national product (GNP) and gross domestic product(GDP) because they are indicators of increased economic activity. In fact, theyought to be considered negative factors, because they decrease the longtermability of societies to sustain themselves.’ The ecological damage, depletion ofresources and toxic pollution generated by companies require massive clean-upsor remediation projects. Taxpayers rather than corporations generally end uppaying the bills, as the health of the planet deteriorates.The alternative is to make planned obsolescence obsolete. All goods should bemade as durable, as long lasting, as possible. They should be designed so theycan be easily repaired, not thrown out. Electronic devices should be made fromcomponents that can be replaced when necessary, when an upgrade comes along. Allproducts should also be made in such a way that they don’t contaminate theEarth. After reducing toxic emissions to a minimum, we will seek to eliminatethem entirely. Companies can be made responsible for their products over theirentire life cycle and be legally bound to recycle and reuse all of theirelements.What Do We Do?An economy is, fundamentally, a way of shaping matter, energy and time,according to human intention. If we are going to survive our currentpredicament, we must redirect our intention, and reshape our financial system tomove in a new direction. We need to stop overuse of natural resources, limitpollution, enforce an ethos of conservation and sequester carbon, and we need todo it now, before the situation becomes any more dire or irrevocable. As RogerSmith notes, we confront a stark choice between ‘emergency contraction’ and‘ecological collapse’. This means quickly cutting back on manufacturing,distribution, unnecessary consumption, pointless trends in fashion and gadgetry.We should comprehensively refocus our industrial powers, only supportinginnovation that helps to salvage, reclaim, restore, replenish, regenerate,degrow and downshift.The billionaire entrepreneur Manoj Bhargava, who invented the 5-Hour Energydrink, is one of many innovators currently pointing the way forward. Taking theprofits from his company, Bhargava built a research centre near Detroit,designing new sustainable products to address current world problems. Theseproducts that could be distributed across the developing world include astationary bicycle that generates energy – one hour of pedalling produces enoughenergy to power a house for 24 hours. Bhargava has also constructed a smallscaledesalination machine, the Rain Maker, which can be placed next to wastewatertreatment facilities. The Rain Maker might provide a partial solution tomega-droughts in California, Iran and India. ‘The purpose of business, in theend, is to serve society,’ he has said. ‘I want to redistribute wealth in anintelligent way.’We need more technocrats like Bhargava who are willing to use their capital tobuild sustainable solutions in all areas. At the same time, relying on wealthyentrepreneurs or ‘philanthro-capitalists’ is not a systemic or sustainablesolution. One alternative model was explored by a group of young tech developersduring COP-21 in Paris. ‘Late summer 2015, we have joined forces in a stunningFrench castle to prototype the fossil free, zero-waste society. Our ultimategoal was to overcome the destructive consumer culture and make open-source,sustainable products the new normal.’A collaboration between the OuiShare network based in Paris and OpenState fromBerlin, they called it ‘Eco-Hacking the Future’. Over five weeks, they developed12 separate projects: new modular systems to provide solar power to remoteevents, zero-waste kitchens and easyto- build wind turbines. Among theirprojects was ‘snap-fit kits for urban agriculture’. The developers envision ‘acity where grey walls, rooftops and balconies are transformed into livingecosystems’. Their kits include ‘a chicken coop, vermicomposter, three plantbeds, and two sorts of beehives’.The great opportunity is to repurpose corporations, give them new goals, and usethe incredible expertise and engineering genius they have amassed to address thesocial and ecological crises that may soon overwhelm us. One way to do this isto create innovations in corporate structures. The B Corp is atriple-bottom-line company that seeks to benefit people and planet whilegenerating profit. Another new model is the flexible-purpose corporation, whichis driven by its mission and doesn’t need to generate profit at all. Thatmission could be to find, develop and implement solutions that can be scaledrapidly as we confront the ecological emergency.The possibility of a society where technology would free humanity to cultivateits creative powers and individuality was foreseen by visionaries like OscarWilde and Buckminster Fuller. The stunning prospect is that, even as we confrontthe potential for our own extinction, we also have the prospect of engineering arapid transition to a planetary civilization able to create universal abundancefor all. In The Zero-Margin Cost Society, Jeremy Rifkin explores how theInternet has reduced the actual cost of reproducing non-material goods such asbooks, music, films and online education to zero. The same metamorphosis couldtake place with material goods and also energy. Renewable power could bereliably transmitted and stored through an Internet of Energy. Objects could beproduced locally, via 3D printers, enabled by distributed manufacturing. At thesame time, all industrial production could transition to a closed-loop model,where inputs lead to non-toxic outputs and all waste is recycled, followingnature’s principles.In Cradle to Cradle, William McDonough and Michael Braungart, an environmentaldesigner and a chemist, explore the necessary steps we would need to take toredirect our industrial system. The authors ‘see a world of abundance, notlimits’. They ask, ‘What if humans design products and systems that celebrate anabundance of human creativity, culture, and productivity? That are sointelligent and safe that our species leaves an ecological footprint to delightin, not lament?’As simple examples, McDonough and Braungart imagine producing compostableice-cream wrappers, with seeds embedded in them, so they can be planted in theground and produce a vegetable garden; vehicles might be constructed from hemp,or other materials that decompose naturally. They imagine all power provided byrenewable sources, creating a virtuous circle where both people and nature wouldbe able to thrive.If we were to establish a worldwide industrial system that harmonized withnature, enhancing biodiversity and resilience, the super-organism of humanitywould become a kind of ‘supernature’. We should make it our mission to create ahyper-complex planetary civilization perfectly integrated with the Earth’secology. If this seems impossible to achieve, perhaps that is because we areonly now turning our focus in this direction. Many things that once seemedimpossible have been accomplished by human willpower and imagination.Inventing the FutureThe prospect that we redesign all of our industrial systems following principlesof biomimicry, imitating nature’s zero-waste manufacturing, is a new idea – anda great challenge for our immediate future. Biomimicry seeks to learn from themethods that nature uses to overcome challenges, and replicate its systems andprinciples, in ways that support healthy ecosystems. For example, while the silkthat spiders make is stronger than steel, it is manufactured in a ‘biofactory’without the need for smelting or gigantic vats of boiling sulphuric acid.According to Janine Benyus, author and founder of the Biomimicry Institute,nature can be copied, by human designers, on the level of form and function, aswell as on the level of process. ‘The truth is, natural organisms have managedto do everything we want to do without guzzling fossil fuels, polluting theplanet or mortgaging the future,’ Benyus writes.Velcro, for instance, copies the burrs of the burdock plant, which sticks tofabric. A new moisture-catching materia used in dry regions of Africa to trapearly morning fog, took its design from the shell of the local beetle,containing hydrophilic bumps and furrows that concentrate moisture from the air.In every area of industry, we can learn from nature’s four billion years ofresearch and development.The mycologist Paul Stamets has pioneered the use of mushrooms forbioremediation, repairing the damage and pollution from industrial processes.Stamets calls mycelia ‘the Earth’s natural internet’, because of its ability toexchange information over long distances. He believes that vast undergroundfungal networks function like the liver in the human body, recognizing toxinsand learning, through trial and error, how to neutralize them, break them downand ultimately convert them to food. Stamets has demonstrated the ability ofmycelium to break down contamination from petroleum, pesticides, alkaloids andpolychlorinated biphenyls.‘Tomorrow’s industry will eat, digest, and secrete the things we need not justin imitation of living beings, but through the actual cells of living beings,’write Alex Steffen and Jeremy Falludi in Worldchanging: A User’s Guide for the21st Century. ‘With the help of biotechnology, we can create pools of hackedbacteria that spit out hydrogen, tanks of tweaked fungus that convert garbageinto methane, and vats of tame microbes that allow us to design machines andstructures with natural materials that resemble shells and spider silk.’There is potential as well as peril in biotechnology’s rapid advances. We mustbase the future development of such technology on a holistic, comprehensiveapproach, taking a long view of our relationship to the Earth. Learning frompast mistakes, we must factor in the possibility of unforeseen impacts on theplanet’s ecology, which can degrade human as well as animal health. We need tobecome not just smarter, but wiser.Eco-citiesAs an urban bohemian who grew up in New York, I love my city’s rich culturalhistory and the myriad worlds that overlap each other here. When I walk aroundManhattan these days, however, I have the eerie sensation I am wandering througha gigantic sand mandala – like those intricate patterns laid out by Tibetanmonks which get wiped away once the ceremony ends.For Buddhists, life is an ongoing teaching on impermanence. The ecologicalcrisis is going to emphasize that principle until it becomes a collectiverealization. Our current civilization is not built to last. The more we realizethis now, the faster we can begin to turn our attention to reinventing thesystems, technical and social, upon which we depend.We don’t know how long we have until sea levels rise to inundate many coastalcities. It could be as soon as a few decades. As we lose our urban centres, wewill construct new ‘eco-cities’, to use the term of architect Richard Register.The cities of the future will have to be conceived as ‘scaffoldings for livingsystems’, according to ecological designer John Todd. Eco-cities will functionas biodigestors and composters, places of self-sufficiency and abundance, wherefood is grown, energy is produced and waste is recycled on-site. Like coralreefs or beehives, the cities of the future should enhance the health, beautyand biodiversity of the local ecosystem. They should be designed formulti-generational communities, for bicycles and walking, for creativeexpression and participatory democracy.We will face an ever-growing global refugee crisis in the next decades. We needto apply the hyper-efficiency of capitalist manufacturing and distribution –mastered by companies like IKEA, Walmart and Amazon – to an ecologicallyregenerative, systemic approach. We have the capacity to build durable, modular,carbon-negative housing units that can be shipped across the world, orpotentially manufactured in each locality using 3D printers. In these instantsettlements, people will need to grow their own food and produce energy on-site.A number of initiatives are already testing prototypes for modular houses thatcan be quickly assembled and easily shipped. One such project is ReGen Villages,pioneered by James Ehrlich, an engineer at Stanford.ReGen Villages are self-sufficient communities. The houses come with renewableenergy systems, battery storage units, composting toilets, rainwater catchmentsand insulation built into them. Food can be grown using aquaponic methods thatpreserve up to 85 per cent of water in a closed-loop system where ‘ammoniacreated from fish waste is converted from nitrites to nitrates through bacterialinteraction’. Such ready-made, self-sufficient towns could be mass-produced andshipped across the developing world, or produced on-site via distributedmanufacturing. They could be supplied to refugees as populations find themselvesforced to settle further inland.Water and WasteMuch of the world is already suffering from a crisis of fresh water. Droughtwill become far more prevalent, and dangerous, in the next decades, asmountaintop glaciers cease to provide reliable sources of water for billions ofpeople. Water use has tripled in the last halfcentury, and aquifers are runningdry. To meet this crisis, we will require globally orchestrated efforts in watermanagement plus a massive increase in desalination.Desalination plants are proliferating across the world, with more than 15,000 ofthem now operational. However, as of yet, this technology is still flawed. EvenPeter Diamandis and Steven Kotler, the super-optimistic authors of Abundance,admit that current desalination technology has fundamental drawbacks. The twomain techniques – thermal desalination and reverse osmosis – require excessiveenergy and create toxic waste.Thermal desalination boils water, and then condenses the vapour. In reverseosmosis, water passes through permeable membranes. ‘Neither is the solution weneed’, note the authors.Thermal desalination consumes too much energy for largescale deployment (about80 megawatt hours per megalitre) and the brine by-product fouls aquifers and isdevastating to aquatic populations. Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, usescomparatively less energy, but toxins such as boron and arsenic can still sneakthrough, and membranes clog frequently, reducing the lifetime of the filter.Diamandis and Kotler look towards future developments of nanotechnology – suchas devices that will use nanoparticles to filter out toxic materials in waterand make the desalination process less destructive.As a new development in the conservation of water, Diamandis and Kotler point toa new computer-assisted irrigation system installed in Spain, ‘designed to savefarmers 20 percent of the nine hundred billion gallons of water they annuallyuse’. The world is no longer unexplored territory; we now have the ability tofollow the flows of raw materials and energy on a global scale.Organic waste has a bright future. We have the capacity to develop nowasteprocesses based on nature’s template. Regenerative technologies that can beindustrially scaled include the conversion of organic waste into biogas, whichcan be used for energy. This conversion process happens through anaerobicdigestion, in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in theabsence of oxygen.Technologies based on anaerobic digestion convert manure, municipal wastewatersolids, fats, oils and grease and so on into energy, burnt to generateelectricity and heat, as well as natural gas and fuels for cars, trucks andplanes. The residue includes nutrients that can be used for agriculture, asfertilizer. Sub-tropical countries – like Jamaica, and Haiti, where fast-growingvegetation produces large amounts of bio-mass – could generate theirtransportation fuels from wasted organic materials, without producing excessCO2.Industrial Design and AestheticsThe noble mission of design, now and in the future, will be to package the rapidtransition we need, at all levels. We must collectively conceive of this socialand technological transformation as a seductive, hip, glamorous adventure for usas individuals and for human society as a whole. We can use our industrialsystems to produce circulating, selfregenerating systems for transportation,energy, water and nutriments, for clothing bodies and building homes, forconverting our waste back into energy and food. In order for humanity tograduate from parasitic pariah to planetary partner, we must not only learn toconsume better, but consume far less.To make matters more difficult, we will have to undertake this transition at atime when we face intensifying stresses from natural disasters and depletedresources, along with increasingly desperate refugee populations. We still findourselves hampered by the moral blindness and self-serving cowardice ofpolitical leaders, finance capitalists, fundamentalist despots and other powerbrokers. We also have to confront our own expectations of what the future ismeant to bring us, and accept that we are in a new situation. This requires awillingness to surrender some of our cherished hopes and dreams.Personally, I don’t think we can make effective changes until we understand how‘subjectivity’ – the inner domain of human consciousness – is not somethingfreely determined. Consciousness, identity, subjectivity are mass-produced bythe corporate-industrial megamachine. Those who are designers and media-makersmust be willing to intercede in this process and produce new ‘subjectivities’,shaping new patterns of behaviour and new values for the multitudes. Design andaesthetics will be crucial tools for accomplishing this.Aesthetics and ethics have a functional relationship which influences consumerchoice and impacts on the direction of industrial manufacturing. Design createsobjects of desire. Advertising assimilates humanity’s collective yearnings forstatus, sex and success, and points them towards particular products andindustries. The only way I can envision the type of systemic change of values,beliefs and habits that we need in a short timeframe is through the creation ofa global marketing campaign coupled with, as Buckminster Fuller foresaw, a‘design revolution’. A massive media blitz can give people a new vision of thegood, the true and the beautiful. We have to make conservation, degrowth,post-capitalism, self-sufficiency, sharing resources, food growing, generosityand the virtue of necessity glamorous and fun.We are faced with a difficult, intricate, seemingly close-to-impossible mission.So let’s accept it as our initiation, and even enjoy it in that sense. For a fewdecades, until we have converted to a regenerative society running on renewablefuels and closed-loop industries, people will have to find joy in self-sacrificeand contentment in having less. We must be willing to undertake difficult tasksfor the benefit of the collective. To accomplish this transition, we need toovercome social inertia, break apart stagnant thought structures, and inspirethe masses with new desires, values, habits and behaviours.Summing UpWe find ourselves in a cliff-hanger. As the methane erupts and sea levels rise,a mass die-off could happen soon. On the other hand, if we change directionrapidly, the human family can reach a state of shared abundance. The goal is tobuild, distribute, scale exponentially and share new social and industrialtechnologies supporting resilience and local autonomy. Within a century, wecould have rebuilt eco-cities and redesigned industries for future generationsto live in harmony and in holistic communion with the planet.I realize that many thinkers have argued passionately that our technologicalsociety has reached its apex – that it must give way to a new, more humane formof civilization that is, once again, smaller scale. ‘The high-entropy journeyhumanity has undertaken under the illusion of growth and progress does not havea future,’ writes Vandana Shiva, an activist who crusades against GMOs and forthe rights of farmers in India. ‘We will have to change the road we are on, andwe will have to change our goals. The goals cannot be set by reductionistscience, industrial technologies and neoliberal economies. The goals cannot benarrowly defined as economic growth or consumerism. The goals have to be thepreservation of the earth, her diverse species, and future generations.’Wendell Berry, like many deep and dark ecologists, believes that technologistsare feeding a cultural delusion when they argue that ever-more advancedtechnology can save us from the ecological crisis that technology has unleashed:There is now a growing perception, and not just among a few experts, that we areentering a time of inescapable limits. We are not likely to be granted anotherworld to plunder in compensation for our pillage of this one. Nor are we likelyto believe much longer in our ability to outsmart, by means of science andtechnology, our economic stupidity. The hope that we can cure the ills ofindustrialism by the homeopathy of more technology seems at last to be losingstatus. We are, in short, coming under pressure to understand ourselves aslimited creatures in a limited world.I understand Shiva’s pessimism, and I get why Berry dismisses our naive faith infuturist technologies, noting ‘the work now most needing to be done – that ofneighbourliness and care-taking – cannot be done by remote control with thegreatest power on the largest scale’. And yet, at the same time, I think theonly way we can deal with the mass scale of the problems industrial civilizationhas created is to redirect and repurpose the infrastructure of manufacturing andindustry which now spans the world, as well as make use of the power of media,design and social technology to transform ourselves as a species.In the same way that corporations and media apply many psychological techniquesto create ‘false needs’ in the population, we can use the media and elements ofthe corporate system to create and then spread replicable models of community,alternative economic systems and local forms of participatory democracy.Factories can mass-produce and distribute regenerative technologies andtechniques in agriculture, energy production and so on. My vision is that weresolve the antithesis between indigenous cultures that were small scale andEarth-honouring and postmodern civilization, defined by corporate globalization,in a new creative synthesis, where traditional values and holistic principlesare mass-distributed using the efficient supply chains of global capitalism.We can apply our technology to support ecologically regenerative practices onall levels and in all areas. For example, if we improve desalinizationtechnology, and have these plants powered by solar, we can create enough freshwater for everyone on Earth. We can do this, even as the mountaintop glaciersdisappear and as sea levels rise to make a great deal of ground waterundrinkable.Our mission is to engineer a transition to a post-capitalist society in whicheveryone on Earth receives a basic subsidy. This requires redesigning ourfactories so that the by-products of manufacturing are no longer toxic but feedback positively into the ecosystems, just as all the products of nature do. Wecan rebuild coastal cities as inland ‘eco-cities’, designed to be models ofself-sufficiency. We can relocate and resettle large refugee populations inself-sufficient communities where they produce their own food and energy. TheInternet and mass media become tools to train the global population in directdemocracy, permaculture and bioremediation, so we become stewards of our localecology.If we want to maximize our chances for near-term survival, we must undertake asystemic transition towards renewable power distributed through a globallydecentralized grid. We also must shift our agriculture system away fromindustrial farming that depletes soil and is dependent on fossil fuels. We mustrelocalize a great deal of our food production, and resettle some urbanites inrural areas, retraining them to be farmers – small-scale farming can be improvedby digital technology which helps organize supply chains and distributionsystems.No matter what we do, we will confront increasingly severe ecological crisesover the rest of this century. Realizing that our world is becoming moreprecarious, we can transition to a system that enhances local autonomy,resilience and self-sufficiency. This will be the best way to protect our humanfamily from intensifying crises.At the same time, we need to develop a healthy scepticism and probably rejectmany types of futuristic technologies that could cause more damage to ouralready damaged world, such as nuclear energy and genetic engineering. Ipersonally think we must reject the idea of geo-engineering as a quick fix thatwill allow us to continue on our current path. The most well-knowngeo-engineering proposal is that we spray sulphur particles into the outeratmosphere to reflect the sun’s rays back into space, artificially cooling theplanet. This could wreak further havoc on the climate and cause negativeconsequences for human health. It will also have to be maintained perpetually,as temperatures would skyrocket again as soon as we stopped emitting sulphur. Itis not a good plan.I can’t pretend the challenges we face are anything less than very intense. Wemay see the development of even greater forms of social injustice and wealthinequality, as automation eliminates millions of jobs while droughts and faminesbecome endemic. Instead of this, we have the opportunity to take a differentdirection. We can establish a regenerative society that produces authenticsecurity and is truly utopian, compared to what we have now. Increasingly, manythinkers see our potential to establish a new planetary culture based onethically and ecologically viable principles, combining elements of capitalism,socialism and anarchism in a new political-economic operating system. Thispotential remains latent until we realize it."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURGOD, LOVE AND REVOLUTIONimages [images/9781780289724_img02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"7MYTHOLOGYOne of my personal beliefs is that the kind of transition that may save us isonly possible if it is accompanied by a transformation of planetaryconsciousness – a shift in worldviews. The secular materialism that pervadespostmodern society is, in the end, a form of nihilism. People are told tobelieve that their lives are accidental, that consciousness is a peculiarepiphenomenon and that the universe is meaningless. In many sectors of ourculture, to question that viewpoint is to open yourself to ridicule.I agree with Albert Camus that, in the end, only two worlds can exist for thehuman mind. We must choose between the world of rebellion and the world of thesacred. I know it seems unlikely, but I think our civilization may beapproaching a turning point – a polar reversal – where we break free of theconsciousness of rebellion and return to the sacred. This shift is indicated bymany long-term trends – some continuing for more than a half-century – thatinclude the integration of Eastern mysticism and indigenous shamanic practicesinto our technological society.If we are going to find the will, courage and tenacity to confront this oncomingcatastrophe, we need to reconnect with a sacred, transcendent dimension. Ibelieve we can build a bridge between the mainstream religions – Christianity,Islam and Judaism – with their billions of devotees and the cutting-edge ideasof contemporary explorers who use psychedelics, yoga, meditation, seekingheightened awareness. Ultimately, as the Dalai Lama has said, everybody wants abetter life. If they are shown a way to get there, they will take it.I find many people I know are living on the razor-edge of nihilism right now,skating the edge of the void. In my own life, I have lived through the eruptionand the projection of my own shadow material, particularly around sexuality –and I see many people undergoing their own versions of this, in different areasof their lives. I can’t help but see this as a perfectly appropriate and evennecessary part of a process that could lead to our apotheosis as a species (thebirth of the Übermensch, who, according to Nietzsche, represents the fusion of‘the mind of Caesar’ with ‘the soul of Christ’) or our collective dissolution.It is exciting that this process seems to be happening within our currentlifespans.We lack a moral centre in our society as we rapidly plunge towards the abyss. Itis extraordinary – in itself, miraculous – that the new Pope, Pope Francis, hasshown up as one of the only people in our entire planetary culture able to speakdirectly to the needs of our moment – he calls for an ‘ecological conversion’,for shared sacrifice on the part of the wealthy elite, a new mode of empathicand compassionate action for us all. In the encyclical, On Care for Our CommonHome, Francis writes:All-powerful God, you are present in the whole universe and in the smallest ofyour creatures. You embrace with your tenderness all that exists. Pour out uponus the power of your love, that we may protect life and beauty. Fill us withpeace, that we may live as brothers and sisters, harming no one. O God of thepoor, help us to rescue the abandoned and forgotten of this earth, so preciousin your eyes. Bring healing to our lives, that we may protect the world and notprey on it, that we may sow beauty, not pollution and destruction.Pope Francis could rehabilitate the Catholic tradition, which seemed utterlyhopeless – corrupt and antiquated – and turn it into a progressive force forgood. In fact, we are going to need a number of miraculous conversions andreversals such as this one if we are going to survive as a species, and learn toflourish together with nature in the short time before it is too late to doanything but undergo a universal, horrific meltdown – a Chod ritual, on aplanetary scale.In some ways, the infusion of Eastern metaphysics into the Western worldview isnot helping. It may actually be exacerbating our current crisis of values. Thepopular Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh has recently prophesied that within ahundred years, the human race may go extinct. His perspective is accurate,according to scientific predictions. With an accelerated warming cycle like theone that caused the Permian Mass Extinction, 250 million years ago,another 95 per cent of species will die out, including Homo sapiens. That is whywe have to learn to touch eternity with our in breath and out breath. Extinctionof species has happened several times. Mass extinction has already happened fivetimes and this one is the sixth. According to the Buddhist tradition there is nobirth and no death. After extinction things will reappear in other forms, so youhave to breathe very deeply in order to acknowledge the fact that we humans maydisappear in just 100 years on earth.There is a kind of fatalism to much Buddhist thought that doesn’t mesh with ourWestern approach to reality. Personally, I find myself resonating far moredeeply with the Pope’s call for a new spiritual mission that unifies humanitybehind protecting life and nature than I do with Hanh’s view, although Irecognize the validity of his statement. We possess creative, empathic andimaginative capacities which seem be a divine power and dispensation. Instead ofsuccumbing to Eastern fatalism or Western nihilism, we can choose to make use ofour abilities to reverse the current direction of our civilization – to confrontthe ecological mega-crisis as a true initiation. Realizing what is at stake andwhat is possible, we can offer ourselves as vessels of this transformation.Therefore, this current section will address what I think are some of the mostpowerful mythological structures we encounter as we undergo personal andplanetary initiation: the quest for meaningful love and connection, spiritualawakening, and liberation through political revolution. As human beings, we arealways forming mythologies. We can’t speak, or even think, without buildingnarratives, stories and interpretative frameworks. The problem is that we cometo believe in the stories we create, or the ones that have already been createdfor us. We forget that an original, formless awareness precedes any words orideas. Meaning is always something we make; it doesn’t exist as an objectivething in the world. It is difficult to accept fully that we are responsible forwhatever we choose to believe. Most people prefer to become entranced,hypnotized, by cultural concoctions, which easily turn into cults and beliefsystems.Earlier, we explored the idea that the ecological crisis is actually a rite ofpassage for humanity, an initiation that will force us to become morecompassionate, adult, decent, responsible, attentive and cooperative as aspecies – to spread our butterfly wings. Part of this metamorphosis will, Ibelieve, be a mystical as well as a psychic unfolding or realization.Until very recently, the modern belief was that only human beings possessconsciousness. Increasingly, we find an alternative viewpoint emerging, whichsuggests that consciousness is an immanent property in all living and evennon-living things. According to the emergent discipline of epigenetics,consciousness – awareness – is present at the boundary of the cell, whichchooses what molecules it will incorporate into its metabolism, and which willpass through it. As its chemical sensors make this decision, the cell canproduce one of many thousands of variants of genetic material.Consciousness attains more complex expression, as life evolves into increasinglysophisticated forms. I think it makes most sense to see human beings – with ourmore developed sense of self-awareness, our larger brains allowing for morecreativity and intelligence – as an expression of the total web of life onEarth, from which we are inseparable. We are less a single species than we arethe cutting-edge of this planet’s evolutionary process – our bodies and thestructure of our brains encompass the entire history of life on this planet.Humanity is part of nature, and nature wastes nothing as it continuouslyevolves. We are, most probably, undergoing a process with an underlying purposeand intention, just as foetal development leads to birth. We have woven atechnical infrastructure around the planet – a sheath of industrial machineryand toxic waste – like a chrysalis or cocoon. We can use this cocoon of thetechnosphere to create a collective metamorphosis.The planetary mega-crisis is both material and spiritual, physical and psychic.In fact, it supersedes those dualisms, revealing them to be false. The New Agespirituality that has permeated our culture since the 1960s is tainted byself-serving values. Its proponents directly or indirectly condone theprivileged lifestyle of the developed world, which is responsible for thedestruction of the Earth’s ecosystems and the immiseration of the developedworld. The next unfolding of our understanding will lead beyond it, as werealize our unity with our human family – the crew of Spaceship Earth, ourplanetary tribe – as well as the greater community of life.The Elder BrotherIn my mind, I often contrast the mythological worldview of the postmodern West –our inveterate faith in hyper-individualism, materialism and technologicalprogress – with that of indigenous cultures I have visited. A few years ago, Ihelped organize two retreats with the Kogi and Aruak people, indigenous groupswho live high up in the remote mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta inColombia. The Kogi and Aruak wear peaked caps and homemade white clothes, whichthey weave on their looms. With uninterrupted traditions going back thousands ofyears, they are autonomous, self-reliant and peaceful.The Kogi call themselves the elder brother, and the modern culture of the West,younger brother. They only became known to the outside world a few decades ago,when they began to issue warnings about the potentially catastrophicconsequences of our continued mistreatment of the Earth. The heirs of apre-Incan civilization, they express a living philosophy that unites thephysical and spiritual worlds.The future leaders and shamans of the Kogi – called Mamas because they identifywith the mother, the feminine principle of fertility, soul and soil – arerecognized in early childhood. As children, these future teachers spend as longas nine years in dark retreats, never directly exposed to the light of day. Theybelieve that the origin of everything that happens on Earth begins in thespiritual realm, which is darkness. Before they can become Mamas, wisdomkeepers, they must know the darkness, the formless, and learn its ways.Rooted in an ancient oral tradition, the Kogi and Aruak Mamas project greatdignity, rarely wasting a word. According to ethnobotanist Wade Davis:When the priests, or Mamas, speak, they immediately reveal that their referencepoints are not of our world. They refer to the Spanish conquest as if it were arecent event. They talk openly of the force of creation, or Se, the spiritualcore of all existence, and aluna, human thought, soul, and imagination. What isimportant, what has ultimate value, is not what is measured and seen but whatexists in the many realms of meanings and connections that lie beneath thetangible realities of the world, linking all things.For the Kogi, all life is sacred, a continuum. Seemingly simple actions havegreat significance. I found the Mamas to be the most centred people I have evermet. For them, every moment is ceremony; the only time that exists is sacredtime.The Kogi men chew bitter coca leaves out of a gourd, the poporo, which they mixwith powdered seashells. They meditatively scrape the stick which they use toextract the white, chalky powder around the outside of the gourd. The gourd hasa womb-like shape and represents the universe. The coca leaf, they say, helpsthem to speak the word of truth.When the Kogi brought together the men in our group to try it for the firsttime, we sat together in darkness for over an hour. They asked us to contemplateits effects. Over time, I found that chewing the leaves induced a state ofclarity and calm. I felt it connected my mind with my heart – so different fromcocaine, which extracts the coca from the leaf and synthetically binds it withsulphuric acid to maximize a reptilian, robotic rush.Over the course of a number of days, I listened attentively to the teachings ofthe Mamas, often conveyed through stories and allegories. I wanted to grasp theessence of what they came to teach us.‘Nature is a book that we learn to read by understanding its signs,’ DonLeonardo, the Kogi Mama told us. By interpreting the signs, the Kogi communicatedirectly with the cosmos. He gave us an example of how a Kogi might walk past adog with a butterfly in its mouth, on a path. From that encounter, he might knowthat his uncle, in a distant town, had passed away.Their philosophy resembles Taoism, where the true man, who acts throughnon-action, maintains the balance between Heaven and Earth. The human being, inthe worldview of the Kogi as in the Tao, is not accidental or contingent. Wehave an essential function in the cosmos; our role is to reflect its equilibriumand harmony, thus maintaining order. We support nature’s continuity through ouraction and intentions – also through our prayers and meditations. Over thecourse of a week, the Kogi instructed us in ways to make ‘payments’ to theEarth. We imprinted the energy of our prayers and intentions into cotton balls,which they then buried in hidden, sacred places.Through our translator, I asked if the Kogi and Aruak believe that the physicalworld is a direct reflection of our level of consciousness, or spirituality. DonLeonardo smiled. ‘That is why we walked 25 hours down from our home in themountain – to tell you that,’ he said.According to the Kogi, the reason we now experience increasing earthquakes,tsunamis, nuclear meltdowns, floods and other natural and manmade cataclysmsacross the world is ultimately spiritual. Industrial waste is a result of ourlow level of spiritual development; pollution reflects our lack of awareness ofour interdependence with nature and cosmos. The world is in turmoil because wehave failed to maintain a sacred, reciprocal relationship with Mother Earth: welost our way. The nihilism of our culture reflects this.The Kogi and Aruak see nature and man as a continuum. They believe our actions,and even our thoughts, influence the invisible spiritual worlds that expressthemselves in all natural phenomena, through the weave of synchronicity in whichwe are enmeshed. Our technological society perceives nature and the physicalworld as resources, devoid of spirit, which we can consume however we want.Increasingly, the elites in our society drink ayahuasca and explore otheraspects of indigenous spiritual traditions. But we have not integrated thehumility and reverence for the creative forces of nature that we find incultures like that of the Kogi. We have not yet understood that life itself isthe prayer and the ceremony.The Spiritual WorldsOur thoughts, intentions and beliefs are very powerful. Just like indigenouspeople, we build stories, mythologies, out of our experience of the world. Wehave no choice but to create myths – it is part of who we are. We do itconstantly. But we have a choice in what kinds of stories we create and chooseto follow. We can live experiential mythologies that empower us to be great, orwe can passively conform to cultural narratives that enforce cynicism, futilityand apathy.Our civilization has a number of myths and stories about the world which manypeople, unfortunately, believe are true. For instance, many people now believethat life is senseless and empty, that human consciousness is a meaningless blipin an accidental universe, that it doesn’t matter whether we continue as aspecies or destroy ourselves, because the Earth can create a more intelligentspecies after us. Many people believe we have no power to change our situation,and it is pointless to try. Another idea is that we are incubating the robotswho will take over. These myths reinforce the fatalistic view of man and thecosmos that has become prevalent. They provide us with excuses for inaction.Personally, I believe we live in a multi-dimensional cosmos, inhabited by manylevels of consciousness, and various forms of spiritual beings. There may beinfinite dimensions, vast spider webs spanning subtle sub-quantum realms ofconsciousness, which we can discover and explore. In fact, I believe that theexploration of the psyche is part of our human birthright. It is one of thereasons we have been woven into this creation.According to the mystical philosopher G I Gurdjieff, the universe follows theprinciple of ‘reciprocal maintenance’, where all beings consume and also providesustenance to other beings. Human beings take in food, water and air, as well asthe perceptions and sensations registered by our bodies. We transform theseforms of energy into thoughts and feelings. Gurdjieff proposes that the subtleenergy of our thoughts and emotions are also ‘food’ for spiritual beings whoexist in subtler realms or other dimensions. Prayer and devotion are one kind ofsustenance we can offer them. As we evolve in consciousness and sensitivity, theenergy we provide also becomes more nourishing to the beings of the spiritualworlds.As an emergent property of biological evolution, and of matter itself, humanconsciousness provides the necessary basis – the stable ground – for thesespiritual and occult realms to make themselves tangible. We provide the rawmaterial for the beings who are part of the spiritual worlds to learn, grow andevolve. According to Kabbala, our existence is necessary so that God can learnabout Himself and give substance to His values. Without human beings, thesevalues and principles remain purely abstract. According to these mystical ideas,our existence is not meaningless. Our work here on Earth is connected to vastrealms and myriad dimensions of spirit. As we evolve ourselves, the cosmosevolves.According to Rudolf Steiner, we inherited a ‘cosmos of wisdom’, where everythingwas perfectly formed. Our bodies, for instance, woven together from trillions ofmicroorganisms, are masterpieces of design.The planets orbit each other in complex geometrical relationships based on theGolden Ratio, also known as Phi. Our role as human beings is to transform thecosmos of wisdom we inherited into a ‘cosmos of love’ – a process that couldtake eons.Just as there is an ecology of life forms on the Earth, there may be a vastecology of astral and etheric beings who live in parallel universes or differentdimensions. I believe we will, eventually, undertake an exploration and study ofthese myriad worlds-within-worlds. In the future, I believe, we will transitionto what José Argüelles called a ‘psycho-technical civilization’ – a civilizationthat explores and develops our psychic nature. As part of this shift, we willlearn from indigenous and traditional cultures around the Earth and develop a‘spiritual science’. A spiritual science does not contradict material science,but enhances it.I do not think psychedelic substances are for everybody. I do believe they havean important, even a critical, function. Psychedelics open us to visionary,intuitive forms of perception. They give us access to otherwise invisible worldsand occult realms, and allow us to experience different aspects of time. Theyremind us that the universe is a dreamemanation of an infinite consciousness –an incredible art piece – of which we are all expressions and aspects. Theyreveal our separation as a temporary illusion.We overly emphasize a particular kind of rational and analytical thought, withdestructive consequences for our world. At the same time, this is all inevitableas part of our journey. It is one chapter in a greater story. I am notsuggesting we reject rational, analytical thought for intuition. We need to findthe balance, integrating reason and intuition, the psychic and the physical,masculine and feminine ways of knowing, to reach a new level of coherence, a newunderstanding of ourselves and our universe. I know this can seem an impossibletask. Once we master it, however, it will become our habitual nature, our newbaseline state.In my earlier books, I wrote about DMT, which comes in two forms. One form,nn-DMT, reveals a hyper-dimensional other reality that is beyond the ability oflanguage to describe. The other form is 5-meO-DMT, secreted by the glands of thehomely Bufo toad, native to Mexico’s Sonoran Desert and the American South-West.A few years ago, I smoked 5-meO-DMT on a rooftop in the artsy, bohemian Condesadistrict of Mexico City. I was there to speak at a festival organized by a webmagazine, Pijama Surf. My Mexican friends insisted I meet a young shaman who hadbeen working with indigenous groups in the Sonoran desert, cultivating andmilking the toad. I felt some fear, recalling previous trips. As many times asone takes DMT, I find there is still an innate terror and awe connected to theexperience.This time, as soon as I inhaled the powder, the world around me, and any senseof identity, vanished completely. There was only oceanic bliss, with no name orform or boundary. I can’t say I was having this experience; there was no ‘I’ tohave it. Subject and object did not exist. The closest I can come to describingthe visual effect would be as a crystalline whiteness, a luminous mandala;delicate, feathery traceries, similar to the patterns found in Islamic art,extending in all directions, infinitely. But that is just an image. During theshort trip (it can last from five to twenty minutes), you are not looking atthis endless crystalline expanse from outside. You are all of it, dissolved intoit.As I came out of the trance, I recalled the boundaries of my identity. I feltgreat joy. In this limited Möbius strip of space-time that is life – my life, tobe precise – I feel rushed, always fighting a deadline, unable to accomplishmore than a fraction of what I would like. But I suddenly knew there will betime – endless no-time – for everything to happen, for every possibility toripen, for every missed opportunity to be taken, in parallel dimensions andmultiplex worlds.My joy subsided, however, to be replaced by a slowly growing horror that seemedjust as limitless. My mind recoiled from the direct experience of an ultimatereality – void, Nirvana – where mind could not exist.‘How else can one threaten than with death?’ asked the writer, Jorge LuisBorges. ‘The interesting, the original thing, would be to threaten someone withimmortality.’As I emerged from the void, I thought of all the projects I wanted to undertake– all the women I wanted to love. I saw how, given eternity, I would have thelatitude to learn many languages, master lucid dreaming, compose symphonies,develop a superb three-point shot, write novels that would challenge Proust andNabokov, master herbalism, study astrology, become a Tantric adept, DJ at RobotHeart. But as I felt the limitless expanse of time extending ever further, acoldness, a numb futility, crept over me. All of my ideas of what I would doseemed pathetic. I felt trapped between the mediocrity of my ego, which Idesperately wanted to cling to, and that pristine Absolute where ‘I’ no longerexisted, but all was totally safe, entirely at peace.In The Transcendent Unity of Religions, the Sufi philosopher Frithjof Schuondraws a distinction between religion and mysticism, or the exoteric and esotericpaths to God. Religions, with their ornate rituals and hierarchical powerstructures, seek to indoctrinate – mind-control – mass populations. The priestsestablish a code of beliefs and moral laws for the faithful to follow. On themystical path, priests have no authority. The goal is direct experience, whichcan be reached through many different techniques.The Cosmic IllusionReligions, exoteric cults, can’t handle the more difficult revelations, theparadoxes, known to mystical philosophy. One of these, Schuon writes, is ‘thedoctrine of the cosmic illusion’, the realization that ‘the world is not onlymore or less imperfect or ephemeral, but cannot even be said to “be” at all inrelation to absolute Reality, since the reality of the world would limit God’sreality and He alone “is”.’When mystics encounter a personal God in their visions, they are only accessingone level of manifestation: ‘Being Itself, which is none other than the PersonalGod, is in its turn surpassed by the Impersonal or Supra-Personal Divinity,Non-Being, of which the Personal God or Being is simply the first determinationfrom which flow all the secondary determinations that make up cosmic Existence.’The experience of taking 5-meO-DMT supports Schuon’s view on the ‘DivineImpersonality’, as well as Buddhist and Eastern thought. In the Tibetan Book ofthe Dead, there are a number of different ‘Bardo Realms’, worlds or dimensions.Each Bardo is inhabited by different types of beings who are dominated byparticular emotions. There is a Bardo of the gods, the demi-gods, the HungryGhosts, animals, and so on. Our human realm is one of the Bardo Realms. All ofthe Bardos are, ultimately, illusions. In a negative sense, they can be seen astraps. For the Tibetans, even the god realm is a trap – a god can live for manyeons, have orgasms that last for untold kalpas, but gods eventually die. Even agod will have to be reincarnated in one of the lower Bardos, and undergo thewhole cycle again.Only humans, according to Buddhists, have the potential to attain enlightenmentand exit the otherwise interminable cycle of rebirth. Our opportunity to do thiscomes after we die, when either we will reincarnate into one of the BardoRealms, or we can choose to enter the Clear Light and merge with the infinite.Taking 5-meO-DMT, secreted from the glands of a homely desert toad, allows us toexperience the Clear Light, Nirvana or the void for a few minutes of clock timethat seem relatively endless, while we are still alive. Perhaps our evolutionaryimpetus is to merge with that infinite spaciousness while remaining embodied andindividual.We also find descriptions of the Clear Light, or Nirvana, in other traditions.Kabbalists use the term Ein Sof, ‘the fullness of being and absolutenothingness’: God prior to His manifestation as the universe – as anythingtangible. Forgetting its origins in the infinite divine source, consciousnessplunges into matter, into separation, to explore its creative capacities. As thepoet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote, ‘Although we may not like it, / God is growing.’God grows through us.A number of occult cosmologies describe how humanity undergoes evolution ormetamorphosis, passing through a series of stages of consciousness, worlds,dimensions, planetary incarnations. This may be true. At the same time, thesestages or levels are relative, contingent and illusory compared to thenon-dimensional zero point of absolute reality, without time or space, subjector object, where there is neither being nor becoming. Everything we experienceas time has already occurred, from the perspective of a higher dimension.Physicists postulate ten dimensions of space-time. As humans, we are embedded inthe fourth dimension. We know one dimension of time – duration – and threespatial ones. It is difficult to conceive – the recent film Interstellar triedto depict it – but a being in a higher dimension would be able to pass throughtime as we walk through space. Our entire space-time – this universe – would beperceived as a sculptural object, which could be observed, played with,manipulated, from different angles.The tenth dimension could be considered the loom of vibrating subatomic SuperStrings, underlying any space-time manifestation. When we smoke 5-meO-DMT, weescape the limits and constraints of our personal identity and directlyexperience that luminous, resonating emptiness, realizing our original nature asunborn, uncreated, eternal and infinite. The experience directly supports theTantric view, which realizes that Samsara – the transitory illusion of materialreality – is Nirvana.‘The Tantric approach is to see all life experiences as the play of the sameOne’, wrote Georg Feuerstein in Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy.Whether positive or negative, all experiences are embedded in absolute joy, thegreat delight (maha-sukha) of Reality. When we have understood that what wedread the most – be it loss of health, property, relationships, or life itself –is not occurring to us but within our larger being, we begin to see thetremendous humor of embodiment. This insight is truly liberating.When we integrate this Tantric insight, we will be able to face the ecologicalnightmare and embrace the political and social mission our world needs from usnow as our initiatory path. We keep running away from the heaviness and sadnessof this world – the senseless suffering and unnecessary misery of multitudes,the global sex trade, the destruction of rainforests to produce McDonald’scheeseburgers and Doritos, the cynicism of CEOs and hedge-fund managers. We mustturn towards it and confront it. But we must also realize – as DMT and othermystical experiences show us – that the entire drama is designed to bring aboutour illumination and awakening. We can find the joy and lightness, the divineplay, in all of it.We find ourselves now at the start of the spiralling return, from separation tounity, from unconscious ignorance to superconscious awareness, from all forms ofphysical, mental and spiritual constraint to the unobstructed liberation that weknow in the deepest part of ourselves to be our original state. Humanity mayundergo further transformations and mutations, as consciousness evolves. Wemight, ultimately, transition out of physical incarnation altogether, becomingmulti-dimensional beings, self-created, formed from akasha, astral light orquantum substance. Anything is possible, really. Most likely, what lies ahead ofus is more incredible than we can possibly imagine. But we are not ready tocelebrate yet.For Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy as well as Waldorf Schools andBiodynamic Agriculture in the early years of the twentieth century, the Earthitself, as well as individual human beings, reincarnates, again and again. Weare currently in the fourth incarnation of the Earth, moving – speedily,inexorably – towards the fifth. Each time the Earth reincarnates, many humansouls have not developed sufficiently to be able to handle the new conditions.Their evolution continues, Steiner notes, in other worlds appropriate for them,in parallel dimensions.Steiner’s mythopoetic language is difficult to grasp – he admitted that when hedescribed conditions of existence in the far future as well as the distant past,he was discussing things far beyond the capacity of our language to express. Heclaimed to have ‘supersensible’ visionary abilities since early childhood – likea continual DMT drip – which allowed him to develop a spiritual science based onhis psychic investigations.I love Steiner’s ideas, but I don’t think any occult cosmology should be takenliterally. The various occult philosophies can be counterpoised against eachother, like musical compositions, themes and variations, to reveal underlyingpatterns and resonances. An esoteric Christian, Steiner believed that Christ’slife had great significance – Christ didn’t ‘save our souls’ through hissacrifice. He provided a model, a template, for how we must live, if we want ourspecies to evolve and transcend its current condition.Steiner deconstructed the biblical postulate of a singular devil. Instead, heproposed there were various occult forces working on us all the time, drawingenergy from us and using us for their own purposes. He described two forces –necessary for our development but also dangerous, as they can pull us intodeviation – as Lucifer and Ahriman. Lucifer means ‘light bringer’; Lucifericspirits pull us up and away from the Earth, towards artistic beauty, genius,romantic illumination, but can also lead us into arrogance, hubris and pride.Ahriman represents the opposing force, or being, which drags us downwards,towards materialism and materiality, soulless mechanization, steriletechnologies, nihilistic oblivion.In Steiner’s cosmology, there are also spiritual hierarchies, angelic and divinepowers. We can commune with them through our higher cognitive faculties –intuition, imagination and inspiration – and align with them. As human beings,we are meant to work with the spiritual hierarchies to take a creative andparticipatory role in the cosmic unfolding.Steiner foresaw that the twenty-first century would see the rise of Ahriman.Today, many occult thinkers believe that our current faith in technologicalprogress – the Singularity theology expressed by Ray Kurzweil and others –represents Ahriman’s attempt to make humanity deviate from its proper path ofspiritual development. Ahriman seeks to make the human ego immortal throughbiotechnology and nanotechnology, ultimately merging it with computer-basedartificial intelligence to construct a synthetic, simulated universe that wouldbe like an isolation chamber – a hell realm, an infinite hall of mirrors – cutoff from divinity, from access to our spiritual source.Philosophers and mathematicians explore the possibility that this universe is asimulation or simulacrum. The Cambridge philosopher Nick Bostrom, atranshumanist, argues that at least one of the following postulates must betrue: ‘(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a“posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run asignificant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variationsthereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation’. He leanstowards the third option.Bostrom uses terms taken from the tech world to propose something that is, inessence, identical to the Buddhist or Hindu view that the universe is Lila,divine play, and Maya, cosmic illusion. In Hinduism, this illusion is maintainedby the magical, creative power of the Gods. The Gods could be seen asextra-dimensional programmers running our sublime simulation. The scientific,technological worldview is converging deliriously with mystical thought. Weteeter on the verge of a creative synthesis, initiating a new paradigm.Technology Is ConsciousnessWe can think about technology as an extension of our biological evolution. Weevolved to be able to move through space, manipulate matter and explore theworld around us. We use technology to extend our innate abilities in alldirections. We augment our ability to move through space and transform matter bybuilding cars, planes, bulldozers, rocket ships and so on. We enhance ourthinking capacities through computers, media networks, search engines and thelike. As human beings, we continuously seek to explore, to learn, to go further.That is part of our nature.Even language is a kind of technology. Language originally developed so thathuman groups could coordinate their actions and intentions. As accidentalby-products, the birth of language – the word, or the logos, which was ‘in thebeginning’, according to the Bible – gave birth to conceptual thought, poetry,philosophy, culture, complex societies. As a tool-using and tool-making species,we constantly experiment and invent new technologies. These reveal new aspectsof our being to us, and lead us to create, and iterate, the next set of tools.Technology and consciousness are so intimately related that they could beconsidered synonymous.We currently hover on the brink of manifesting extraordinary as well asfrightening possibilities, through science and technology, that may radicallytransform our species’ capacities. For instance, soon we may be able to extendthe human lifespan indefinitely, making people ‘a-mortal’, if not immortal.Scientists are uncovering the mechanisms that cause us to age and learning howto alter them.As Nature magazine notes, ‘Chromosomes have caps of repetitive DNA calledtelomeres at their ends. Every time cells divide, their telomeres shorten, whicheventually prompts them to stop dividing and die.’ In studies, mice wereengineered to lack the telomere enzyme. They aged rapidly. When the telomereenzyme was replaced, they bounced back and de-aged, regaining youth andvitality. This suggests ‘the possibility that normal human aging could be slowedby reawakening the enzyme in cells where it has stopped working’.Scientists caution that ageing has complex causes. Even if we alter ourtelomeres, we would still die of cancer and other diseases, eventually.Yet it is possible that breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology will be ableto address these conditions. We can currently print organs and body parts using3D printers. Stem cell transplants may allow us to regrow damaged tissue. Ourtechniques for genetic engineering are also advancing incredibly rapidly.If we were able to be ‘vaccinated’ against ageing – to have our cellsrejuvenated – the vast majority of people would want that opportunity. Given thechance, I will be among them. I often feel life is shorter than it needs to be,and barely gives us time to explore a fraction of our potential. I consider theprospect of life extension as an opportunity to make a leap of speciesconsciousness, towards a psychic realization that, even though the world maywear different disguises, our underlying reality is infinite bliss and ecstasy.After all, even if we lived for a thousand or a million years, it would bemeaningless, insignificant, when we consider the billions of years of UniverseTime – or the notime of the Ein Sof.We can foresee that new capacities – appearing in a period of rapidly increasingresource scarcity, mass species extinction and accelerated warming – will leadto new ethical quandaries, beyond anything we have confronted before. The onlyway to handle the deepening contradictions of our situation is to develop moralwillpower, a core ethos of empathy and responsibility, strengthened throughinitiatory discipline and inner work. Before humanity can make the jump to anynew condition of being, we must address the ecological and social catastropheswe have unleashed on our Earth. We must take care of all of our brothers andsisters who have been consigned to lives of squalor and ignorance, making acommitment to lift them up as equals and love them.From where we are now, it feels, subjectively, like we have accelerated over thelast decades. Things used to move in slow motion, now they are lifting offtowards hyper-speed. We live in a science-fiction world that is gettingincrementally trippier, with or without drugs. Every indicator suggests thesituation will become more intense in the years ahead.I believe there is an occult or esoteric reality, and this hidden dimension mustbe acknowledged. We must seek to know it, as much as we possibly can, permeateit with thought, and integrate what we understand into our lives. When weacknowledge the occult dimension, this also must influence our life’s purposeand mission. Occultists tell us that the hidden reality expresses itself throughsymbols, signs, as well as the procession and pageant of historical events. Ifthis is true, we will learn to interpret our world differently. If reincarnationis an occult fact, then we must change our ideas about the meaning and purposeof any individual life.According to hermetic philosophy, whatever appears to us as ‘out there’ is, justas much, ‘in here’. The physical universe, the material world, is a projectionof the psyche, reflecting our current state of being. If the world is changingso rapidly, this means our inner being is also developing and transforming. Ourtechnology – the technosphere – appears to be a ladder we must build and thenclimb, to reach what some have called the noosphere, the next level ofconsciousness.Western mysticism talks about the logos, the underlying language that forms theworld, that was ‘in the beginning’. Science is revealing the logos, decipheringthe code or language of nature, from the genetic all the way to the subatomiclevel. Once again, this reflects the larger process under way.Whether we like it or not or feel ready for it or not, humanity appears to beevolving from a childlike relationship with the cosmos to a partnership withcreation itself. As science opens to integrate the reality of the psyche, we mayfind new ways to express our connection to the sacred. If we make a quantum leapin species consciousness, religions will no longer be dogmatic or divisive.Instead, our human family will realize the essential truth – the core – of alltraditions. We can transcend the current religious structures through ourability directly to experience mystical states which indicate the transcendentunity that is the source of all religions, despite the sectarian differencesthat have led to wars and caused global traumas. In a ‘psycho-technical’civilization, based on devotional explorations of consciousness, we can mergescience and spirit, welcoming all faiths in a new synthesis.Some indigenous cultures talk about this age as the time when humanity ‘dreamsthe world awake’. Where the reality we experience once seemed hard andunyielding, the world is becoming, incrementally, more mutable, mercurial – moreresponsive to our intentions. The gap between thought and manifestation isshrinking. This is a subtle phenomenon – hard to discuss without sounding crazy– but it is also something many people know to be true.I think it is important to acknowledge the mystical or shamanic dimension ofwhat’s happening without negating the reality that our actions as a species aretearing the world apart – threatening us with civilizational collapse and evenextinction. It is the collective burden of our unsustainable lifestyles that hasunleashed this catastrophe on the Earth. The only way we can address thissituation is to accept it as an initiation – choosing to go against the flow andfight the inertia, because that will strengthen and toughen our spirit.As we undergo initiation, we discover that reality becomes, in gradations,increasingly psychic, translucent, malleable. William Blake wrote, ‘The Eternalbody of Man is The Imagination, that is, God himself.’ The world is revealingitself, slowly, to be a total art form, what the original people of Australiacall the dreamtime, an allegorical fable sculpted by the Poetic Genius, theImagination, of which we are all aspects and expressions. As we realize we arethe agents who create meaning for ourselves and each other, we discover we havethe sacred, joyful task of defining a new mythology for our future unfoldingtogether."},{"pageContent":"8LOVEWe must accept from the outset that constructing a regenerative society will inall likelihood be a multi-generational task. That doesn’t mean, however, that wecan leave it to our children. We must undertake this mission ourselves – out ofdevotion, reverence and universal compassion. Learning how to operate SpaceshipEarth, Buckminster Fuller noted, is humanity’s final exam. If we pass, wegraduate to the next level of consciousness as a species.Unconsciously, we have been impelling ourselves towards planetary catastrophe. Ibelieve we are doing this to end our alienation and egocentrism – to reach a newintensity of communion. Because we no longer have rites of passage which createthe same effect through intentionally guided ritual, we are inducing it throughmass catastrophe. But the disasters we are unleashing could have theunanticipated effect of breaking open the collective heart chakra. Collectively,humanity can realize love and solidarity – universal, unconditional – as thebasis for healing our world.This may seem distant, theoretical and abstract, but I think many people alreadysee reverberations of this process in their personal lives. For some, this istaking the form of a deep questioning of traditional relationship patterns –often, a rejection of them, as they seek to create something new. Culturally,the focus on transgendered people, gay marriage, the endless sex scandalstearing down politicians and public figures is all part of this unavoidablechange.We have inherited a restricted model of romantic and erotic love. Most peoplestill believe that monogamy – exclusive partnership – is the only way to findenduring happiness and contentment. Of course, for some people, monogamy is thebest option. But humans are not naturally monogamous, and the current systemforces many people to act hypocritically, to deceive themselves and theirpartners, or to sacrifice their truth.Deep in their hearts, many people feel permanently disappointed, sad, frustratedand angry because they have been unable to satisfy their erotic desires. Men andwomen lead lives of quiet desperation and compromise. An ambience ofdisappointment and frustration permeates our society, in overt and subtle ways.People seek false substitutes for true satisfaction. The insatiable lust forconsumer goods is – I believe – a result of our failure to satisfy our deeperneeds for love, erotic fulfilment, authentic communion.‘We are at war with our eroticism’, write Christopher Ryan and Calcida Jethá inSex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality. After scouringevidence from anthropology and evolutionary biology, they point out that,Human beings evolved in intimate groups where almost everything was shared –food, shelter, protection, child care, even sexual pleasure . . . contemporaryculture misrepresents the link between love and sex. With and without love, acasual sexuality was the norm for our prehistoric ancestors . . . human beingsand our hominid ancestors have spent almost all of the past million years or soin small, intimate bands in which most adults had several sexual relationshipsat any given time.Civilization constructed the institution of marriage, and enforced monogamy, toprotect property rights, under a patriarchal regime which demonized femalesexuality. The force of our repressed sexual instinct was channelled – orsublimated, in Sigmund Freud’s term – into building civilization, creatingculture and making war.The curious fact about human nature is that it is not fixed, but changeable.This is something that makes us different from animals: we are the species thatcan reinvent itself, in many ways. However, some things are very resistant tochange. The instinct towards sexual satiation, for instance, is hardwired intoour biology. We are also unique among animals due to the incessant force of ournon-stop, hair-trigger sex drive.As Gerald Heard explored in the early 1950s in Pain, Sex and Time, we possess atremendous surplus of evolutionary energy, far beyond what we need to sustainourselves. This energy must find outlets for expression. Like Walter Benjamin,Heard believed we need to channel this force consciously, through ritual,initiation and training in special schools devised for this purpose. Otherwise,the excess energy continues to get discharged, through wars and violence.‘If our evolution is over,’ Heard worried, ‘if we have no further originaloutlet to our enormous and fretting energy, then the only choice is slowdegeneracy through sex addiction or a conclusive end through homicidal mania.’The excess energy, the kundalini, driving us reveals something important aboutour destiny as a species. In other words, individually as well as collectively,we can choose to evolve and deepen ourselves, or decay and disintegrate.Some people would say I am the wrong person to write about the subject ofrelationships. They may be right. I certainly don’t recommend that anyone takesmy thoughts and ideas on the subject as the final word or some kind of objectivetruth. I went through a difficult, painful struggle with the powers of Eros inmy own life, a fall from grace related to sexuality that men in power positionsoften experience.I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong – I didn’t deceive anyone. I wasunconscious of how my behaviour was being seen by others, how it was impactingon the people around me. Angry at the restrictive rules of conventional society,resentful due to long periods of erotic frustration, I couldn’t separate my ownshadow from the collective shadow. What I learned from this gives me a goodvantage point to consider the many aspects of our larger predicament – but myideas remain radical.Sexuality Is a SuperpowerSex energy radiates through every filament of our social structure. ‘Sexualityis a superpower,’ writes Dieter Duhm, one of the founders of Tamera, a ‘freelove’ community in Portugal. ‘Our attractions and repulsions, sexual signals andlinks, hopes and disappointments go through all of society like a nerve system,permeating every office, every shopping mall, every art exhibition, everyconference, every group, every company, every political party.’ He believes thatany attempt to suppress this superpower only leads to negative outcomes – aswith those Indian gurus in the 1970s who claimed to be transcendent masters, butcouldn’t resist the charms of their Western female disciples.Duhm was the leader of a group of German radicals who tried to understand why1960s leftist efforts to build a utopian alternative to capitalism ended infailure. He realized there were core issues around love, relationships andsexuality that people could not fully address yet or bring into theirconsciousness. ‘The healing of sexuality is perhaps the most revolutionary stepin the present healing work after thousands of years of suppression andneglect,’ he writes. Because these issues were not addressed, the idealisticefforts to change the world imploded, instead. Communities and movements keptfalling apart. Sex and love were the deepest political issues society could notconfront or integrate.‘The most intimate questions of sex, love, and partnership, of faithfulness,trust, and community, of jealousy, competition, and fear of separation arepolitical questions with global implications’, Duhm writes. He and somelike-minded people decided to step out of society to establish a community as anexperimental laboratory. Their modest goal was world peace. They realized thatpeace on Earth would be impossible until we established peace between thegenders – until we found peace in love. They courageously broke aparttraditional structures and conditioning, seeking a holistic redesign.I remember from my early years, my adolescence, how the cultural ambience aroundsexuality had a dark, shameful feeling. There was no sense that boys and girls –or men and women – might seek to collaborate for each other’s sensual pleasure.That we might enjoy taking care of each other – that we could learn to begenerous, compassionate, with each other. Eroticism was not part of oureducation. It was not something to be explored or studied, even as anafterthought – certainly not with the same kind of analytic rigour we brought tomaths or physics, even though sex would be infinitely more important to ourfuture lives than these academic subjects.Our civilization applies tremendous reserves of intellect and capital toconstruct killer drones, virtual reality devices, surveillance systems –instruments of death, alienation and fear. Yet we believe that love andsexuality are not worthy of our conscious attention. We act as if they areoutside the realm of logic, forethought and social design.‘Whereas the cerebrum is applied in war technology, in love man lives and thinksout of his spinal cord,’ Duhm points out. When we channel more of society’sintellect and resources towards the exploration of love and eroticism – freeingthese areas from an antiquated and unrealistic morality – we will make rapidstrides.Just as we lack rites of passage to introduce us to transpersonal or visionaryexperiences when we are young – when we long, with our whole being, toexperience a deeper intensity of communion, to access something greater thanourselves – we also lack for cultural traditions that would help young people toembrace their sexuality as something wonderful, as a great gift they can exploreand share responsibly. We are still a subtly pleasure-denying society, despiteTinder, OkCupid, casual sex and the hook-up culture. Sexuality is considered aprivate matter, relegated to dark places like nightclubs and bars, which have anunderworld ambience.A lot of my early views on sex were shaped by Beat writers like Allen Ginsbergand Jack Kerouac, as well as their bohemian predecessors, Anaïs Nin and HenryMiller. Perhaps Henry Miller most of all. Miller described life in New York andParis back in the 1930s and 40s as a seething erotic purgatory. The women were,on the one hand, yearning for sex – as he was, constantly – but passive, unableto voice their desire. ‘I was lonely amidst a world of things lit up byphosphorescent flashes of cruelty,’ he wrote. ‘I was delirious with an energywhich could not be unleashed except in the service of death and futility.’With savage humour, Miller’s novels contain numerous scenes that would elicithowls of outrage from feminists today, that would be seen as predatory orabusive. In one book, he describes standing on a crowded bus in rush hour,feeling up the woman who is pressed against him, pressing his fingers into hergroin, convinced she is secretly enjoying it. His protagonist uses all sorts ofsneaky means to overcome feminine resistance. ‘What holds the world together, asI have learned from bitter experience, is sexual intercourse. But fuck, the realthing, cunt, the real thing, seems to contain some unidentified element which isfar more dangerous than nitroglycerine.’In my twenties, I was stricken with envy over men whom I felt were moresuccessful than me, in their careers but, above all, sexually. I started aliterary journal with two friends who were handsome, preppy, media darlings,writing short stories for The New Yorker. One of them had a huge family fortune.He cheated on his fiancée frequently, flying women to Paris for secret weekendaffairs. His wealth, my other friend quipped, was like a giant invisible penison his shoulder. Women reacted to it viscerally.I longed to have the kind of sexual access his wealth provided him. I also feltangry at women, particularly beautiful ones, the ones I desired with suchravenous hunger. These ethereal goddesses almost invariably seemed to choose menbased on their trust funds and bank accounts, or men who got rich by dumbingdown the public or accelerating the destruction of the planet, or who triumphedin some superficial glamour field like pop music or fashion photography.Later on, when I made it as a writer in my thirties, I didn’t anticipate thatother men would feel just as envious and competitive towards me as I had feltabout my peers. I still saw myself as the adolescent underdog, the morose andenvious twenty-something. Although I was exactly the same person as before – theone who felt rejected, underappreciated by women – I was suddenly desirable.Often, after I gave a talk or went on a book tour, women – lovely, intelligent,sweet – approached me. Sometimes they would make it clear they wanted to connectwith me.All of a sudden I had an abundance of sexual opportunities. I’d never thoughtthis would be the result of my books – writing them had been innocent, heartfeltefforts to communicate ideas, acts of service. I hadn’t expected the gift wouldbe reciprocated by the world in this way. I found it so beautiful. But thethrill of it became, quickly, addictive. Unfortunately, instead of feeling happyand satiated, I only wanted more and more.Sexual hunger is quite different from the hunger for food, which is easilysatisfied by a good meal, or even a mediocre buffet. Russell Brand became araging sex addict who slept with up to eighty women a month at the height of hismania, or so he claims. Not only is Russell extremely charming and charismatic,he would also enlist people to help him in his quest to be ‘shagger of theyear’, a title he held several times in a row. Eventually, he realized that thisalmost unbelievable expenditure of sweat and sperm was bringing him no lastingcontentment, so he checked into rehab.Russell may have gone a bit overboard. But my admittedly controversialperspective is that there is nothing wrong with having an abundance, even asuper-abundance, of lovers and sexual partners – whether for men or women – aslong as this is done honestly and without coercion. Unfortunately, in oursociety, the pursuit of sexual desire tends to require all sorts of miserabledeceits, lies and hypocrisies. Also, it is totally unjust and wrong that womenstill get put down for the exact same behaviour that society approves in men.Sex at DawnI realize that just a few pages ago I was writing about occult cosmologies andour potential as a species to achieve unity with the cosmos through mysticalexperience and collective evolution, and, now, here I am considering what soundslike extreme erotic mania as something natural and okay. I am aware that formany people this may seem a jarring dichotomy, and admit I am taking a risk. Butbecause our time for making our evolutionary leap or collective mutation isquite short – I am not certain I will have time to complete another manifestobefore things start to blow up – I feel I must be honest and straightforwardabout what I think and why I think it.I suspect some readers will feel I am promoting a hyper-masculine mode ofsexuality. Of course, men are more biologically prone to seek multiple mates,but women also have the need to pursue various sorts of erotic adventures. InSex at Dawn, Ryan and Jethá review studies that suggest there is an evolutionaryexplanation for why women make louder sounds during intercourse than men. Thesenoises had a function in our early hominid days: the female was calling out toother males in the area to have sex with her in succession. In this way, thechild’s paternity would remain unknown. Also, sperm competition would occur inthe uterus. The female orgasm also has a reproductive purpose, as thecontractions of orgasm pull the sperm deeper into the womb. The male whoelicited the most powerful orgasm would be the one most likely to fertilize heregg.When it comes to sexuality, we have to accept how humans truly are, rather thanhow they are supposed to be, according to some imposed ideal. ‘Monogamy is notfound in any social, group-living primate except – if the standard narrative isto be believed – us,’ write Ryan and Jethá:If you spend time with the primates closest to human beings, you’ll see femalechimps having intercourse dozens of times per day, with most or all of thewilling males, and rampant bonobo group sex that leaves everyone relaxed andmaintains intricate social networks. Explore contemporary human beings’ lust forparticular kinds of pornography or our notorious difficulties with long-termsexual monogamy and you’ll soon stumble over relics of our hypersexualancestors.The planetary mega-crisis is directly related to the problems we confront as aspecies in this area of love and sexuality. One primary urge driving many men toseek success – wealth or fame – is sexual access. Men – Alpha males, inparticular – will do almost anything to attract women. The economic system tendsto reward sociopathic behaviour. To succeed, people must climb corporateladders, sell wasteful products, manage investment funds that transfer resourcesfrom the poor to the wealthy, promote vacuous fashion trends and so on. Thesystem forces people to compromise their ethics and principles, or renounce themaltogether, to get what they want.My anthropological observation is that people – young people above all – wastean unbelievable amount of their life energy in the quest for sexual satiation.This energy that people expend in the incessant pursuit of sexual fulfilment isexactly the energy that we, the human community, need to redirect, channellingit towards our awakening, using it to enact social change and regenerate ourplanet’s ecosystems.Sex itself is not the problem. In our culture, for many people, the act of sexonly consumes a tiny fraction of the energy expended in the pursuit of it. Also,sex can be nourishing, physically and emotionally. If there was no need topursue erotic connections, to compete for mates, we could use that squanderedenergy to confront the ecological crisis we have unleashed as a species, andbring about a rapid cultural evolution.If we can understand, and then fix, the flaws in our social design, our staleideology and antiquated cultural programming, we will liberate a huge amount ofproductive energy for building a regenerative society. We will take a massiveleap forward as a species. And we will do it quickly.I don’t think the answer is to restrict sexual behaviour, which will only leadto more frustration, repression, resentment and deception. I believe thesolution is to consciously liberate Eros – not just Eros as it gets expressedthrough sexuality and romantic love, but also the various forms of love thatbind communities together, including caring for children and old people. We mustunderstand that the Eros that gets expressed through sexuality is not just anindividual problem, but has a very large-scale social and political dimension.Men and women must be willing to cooperate for each other’s happiness ifhumanity is going to have a long-term future on Earth.Hollywood and the media idealize the nuclear family, which is the basic economicunit of our society. When individuals merge into couples, and particularly whenthese couples have children, they tend to direct all their energy and resourcestowards themselves. They lose interest – if they ever had any – in helping thecollective. Instead, they seek to amass resources, playing the competitivecapitalist game.The problem in our culture is the atomization which forces individuals, as wellas nuclear families, to fight for their own success and personal survival. Wecan now see that this system, enforcing selfinterest as a survival mechanism, isnot sustainable for the planet as a whole. It needs to change – since it won’tchange on its own, we need to change it.‘Deep conflicts rage at the heart of modern sexuality,’ write Ryan and Jethá:Our cultivated ignorance is devastating. The campaign to obscure the true natureof our species’ sexuality leaves half our marriages collapsing under anunstoppable tide of sexual frustration, libido-killing boredom, impulsivebetrayal, dysfunction, confusion, and shame. Serial monogamy stretches before(and behind) many of us like an archipelago of failure: isolated islands oftransitory happiness in a cold, dark sea of disappointment.To maintain their relationships, many people find themselves forced to lie aboutor suppress their true desires. The vast majority of men I know who are inlong-term partnerships have confessed they either feel an intense desire forother sexual contacts or have secretly satisfied some of those desires, throughaffairs or prostitutes – feeding the horrific global sex trade. Other peoplelearn to dampen their sexual drive, but I don’t find this a great outcomeeither.I don’t think it is an accident that so many creative artists and geniuses havebeen fascinated with eroticism and sexual love, pursuing the muse as sheexpresses herself in many embodied forms. Erotic love is a kind of fuel thatmakes people feel alive and inspired. Ideally, don’t we want everyone to be asinspired and turned-on as they can be? Wouldn’t we prefer a social system thatsupports everyone in exploring their deepest capacities for love, for erotic andecstatic experience, as long as they are causing no harm to others?There is a direct relationship between our corrupt politics and our failure, asa society, to handle love authentically. When people find themselves forced tolie to or deceive the person closest to them – their partner – about theirdesires, they are conditioned to accept corruption and hypocrisy in society atlarge. They can accept the half-truths of politicians and pundits because theyare compromised themselves. We fail to care for the world as a consequence ofour inauthenticity. After all, why would we want to protect and safeguard aworld that has betrayed us at its core?Eros Unredeemed‘The dream of a new world is not only a subjective wish, but also an authenticmatrix for a different life, anchored in the structures of reality; it is anobjective necessity and a possibility,’ Duhm writes in Terra Nova:The concrete utopia is a latent reality within the universe, just as thebutterfly is a reality latent within the caterpillar. It lies in the structureof our physical and biological world, in our genes, and in our deeper ethicalorientation. Within the context of committed peace work, it is not the fixing ofindividual defects within existing structures that is required; what is requiredis a fundamental system change.As part of the new story or myth of the near future, we will define a new visionof Eros – love and sexuality – which allows for the freeing of love, thefulfilment of desire, without exploitation or manipulation. This is notsomething that individuals can accomplish on their own, although I do know manypeople who have rewritten the laws in their own lives. All of the turbulence,bitterness and disappointment so many people have experienced points towards theneed for a new social structure and a change of values. From what I have seen,Tamera, the community founded by Duhm and his cohorts, is the most advancedeffort to work out the implications of our situation and construct a viablealternative.Living in downtown New York, I find myself in the midst of a purgatorial,hyper-sexualized carnival. Nightclubs still radiate that old hipster attitude,replete with indie rock musicians, tattooed models, fashion world detritus,mostly clad in designer black, tooting cocaine and getting blotto, to the weehours, until Babylon falls. There are also private, all-night ‘play parties’ inManhattan, mixing the flotsam and jetsam of the Burning Man world with anuptown, Eyes Wide Shut crowd. This community engages in consensual sexualgymnastics, in townhouses and hotel suites, with collegial enthusiasm andpeacock pride.The next level of sexual liberation is happening now, along with the breakdownof old relationship models. It is unfolding in real time. Even as they areliving it, most people do not think about it as a problem of system design.Although it is a tentative step forward, the play party or swinger world is notthe answer. Relationships remain shallow and immature, based on ego displays,physical attraction and self-centred hedonism. If we are truly going to liberateEros, love and sexuality – in particular, female sexuality – we have to digdeeper. We need a new approach to community and, ultimately, a new social designthat is holistic, comprehensive and secure. A truly liberated society mustsupport longterm care for children. It must take care of old people. ‘Freelove’, it turns out, requires a great deal of discipline.A Healing BiotopeWhen I visited Tamera, a few hours south of Lisbon in Portugal, I was taken on atour that included the children’s centre. Past the age of two, most of the youngchildren in the community live in a house together, where they are looked afterby a few of the adults. They can go and see their parents whenever they want,but their parents – in particular, their mothers – have their time freed up forother pursuits.Cooperative childcare is a simple but crucial design solution. Lacking acommunity support structure, the nuclear family model is a cumbersome way toraise children. It causes many psychological problems. Even worse is thesingle-parent model. Much of the anxiety in our culture has to do with thissituation. Women must compete with other women, seeking a mate who can offerthem long-term support, through the decades-long process of raising kids.‘How would the prevalence and experience of jealousy be affected in Westernsocieties if the economic dependence trapping most women and their childrendidn’t exist, leading female sexual access to be a tightly controlledcommodity?’ ask Ryan and Jethá:What if economic security and guilt-free sexual friendships were easilyavailable to almost all men and women, as they are in many of the societieswe’ve discussed, as well as among our closest primate cousins? What if no womanhad to worry that a ruptured relationship would leave her and her childrendestitute and vulnerable? What if average guys knew they’d never have to worryabout finding someone to love? What if we didn’t all grow up hearing that truelove is obsessive and possessive?These are exactly the issues that Tamera has addressed.Men and women find themselves trapped in mental webs of jealousy and fear,seeking to protect their investments of time and money, their possessions andproperty. In Tamera, they say, ‘jealousy is to love as asthma is to breathing’.The only way to change this, they believe, is by building community. In acommunity, people can learn to cooperate to satisfy both short-term andlong-term needs. They can work it out, because they are committed to stayingwith each other. In cities like New York, relationships tend to be extremelytransitory by comparison.Many aspects of Tamera amaze me. Duhm, Lichtenfels and their partners foundedthe community nearly 40 years ago in southern Germany and then moved theirproject to Portugal 20 years ago, establishing a vibrant community on aninitially barren property of 330 acres. It has expanded, slowly, to its presentpopulation of 170 people, the majority of them Germans and northern Europeans.The older women are a major force in the community, much like the elder women intribal societies.Over the past ten years, the community has done a great deal of landscaperestoration work, turning an area of dry land into an abundant oasis. The key tothis was establishing a system of lakes (and other installations) to retainrainwater on the land and to replenish the aquifers. They call this a ‘WaterRetention Landscape’, an effective way for overcoming desertification andassuring water and food selfsufficiency for decentralized communities.The Tamerans see a link between how a community treats its water and how ithandles love. They believe that both water and love need vessels of containment,along with opportunities to flow and expand. They believe, in fact, that love’snatural tendency is to expand and to flow – that the monogamy model is anartificial constraint.Many community members have primary partnerships, but most of them also have a‘love network’ of other connections. Over time, Tamera has developed a set ofsocial technologies which allow the community to process issues, such asjealousy, as they come up. They take everything that is normally hidden in ourculture and make it explicit, transparent and visible to all. Benjamin vonMendelssohn, one of my friends who lives there, talks about the ‘communitysuper-soul’, which is greater than the sum of its parts. Very little is hiddenor private.One of the social technologies Tamera developed is called Forum, which the wholecommunity participates in, every day, in groups of 30 or 40 people. DuringForum, everyone joins in a circle. People take turns going into the centre,where they speak about or act out their relationships and experiences with othermembers of the community. Tamerans then give feedback, ‘mirrors’, speaking aboutthem in the third person. The goal is honesty.During one Forum, a young woman spoke in the centre, dancing expressively as shediscussed her past and ongoing relationships with men in the community. Afterher performance, one of the older men, in a position of authority, said, ‘Iappreciated what Martha had to share today, because I have always felt she wasattractive, but I didn’t feel I would ever be able to approach her for a sexualcontact. After what she said today, I did feel it was possible that, at somepoint, I might approach her in this way.’ I was impressed that his comment wasso unadulterated. He said what he was thinking, with no effort to make himselflook good, or try to impress the woman with some insight or advice.Life is a process of learning, and learning is often painful. When I got famous,and women suddenly wanted me in a way they hadn’t before, I became intoxicatedby my new power. Consumed by the free love ideology I had absorbed from theBeats, particularly from Allen Ginsberg, I made the mistake of seeing almost anywoman I found attractive as a potential sex partner.If I had lived within a community like Tamera, I would have received constantreflections and mirrors back from the people around me that would have helped tocorrect my dissolute tendencies. Instead, lacking feedback, I developed negativepatterns, sometimes hurting and offending women by my behaviour, which could bethoughtless and callous. I didn’t possess the tools to understand or address it.Other people saw me as someone in a position of authority or leadership, while Iconsidered myself an apprentice. I still feel I am learning, continuouslychanging and hopefully improving.Tamera conceives of sexual satisfaction as more than the individual’s problem.They consider it a community responsibility – and a sacred one. They have ahouse on their land which is called the Temple of Love. Certain members of thecommunity undergo training in ‘love service’, to become priests and priestessesof the Temple. They make themselves available for other members of the communitywho desire connection. You might find, for instance, an older woman in thecommunity seeking an experience with one of the younger or middle-aged men. Or ayoung man might have his first encounter with an older woman.My friend Martin, for instance, moved to Tamera as a teenager. He had his firstsexual experience with a woman in her thirties, when he was 16. They made aritual out of it. The community gathered around the Temple to celebrate hisinitiation into sexual love. If something like that had happened to me at theage of 16 – if I had been part of a community that cared to make sure my awkwardyearnings were satisfied, rather than suppressed – I think I would havedeveloped a much healthier approach to love.‘We need a revolution whose victory will create no losers because it willachieve a state that benefits all,’ Duhm writes. ‘Eros and religion need to cometogether again so that we human beings can rise up to the source from which allof life originates.’CommunionWhen we envision the transition to a post-capitalist, post-work society, we musthave a plan in mind for redirecting the productive and creative energies ofhumanity as a whole. I think this ideal of a liberated Eros provides the basisfor it. If we can create communities that allow people to have deep partnershipsrooted in truth, along with other lovers if they desire them, we would no longerfeel cheated by a world that seems to deny our deepest desires and yearnings. Aslabour becomes more automated, we will have more time to explore the communionof souls, as well as bodies, that our deeper nature seeks. We will restructureour society to enable this.In many parts of the world, women are still horribly oppressed – in Muslimcountries, in African cultures that are based on male power and even mutilatefemale genitalia through circumcision. Then there is the global sex trade,Internet porn – the massive industries that exploit women around the world.Equalizing the status of women, globally, is the quickest path to positivesocial change, on many levels. When women’s power and access to educationapproaches that of men, the birth rate falls below replacement levels.The scientist Rupert Sheldrake developed the idea of morphic resonance. Hetheorizes that the ‘laws of nature’ are not fixed and immutable. They are habitsor patterns that become more coherent over time, until they seem permanent. Thishappens through a resonance on the level of form, shaped through holographicprinciples. As an example, once a first crystal forms when a certain group ofmolecules come together, it makes it more likely that another crystal willappear, given those same conditions, since a new morphogenetic field for crystalformation has been created. As this happens a few times, the morphogenetic fieldstrengthens, stabilizes, and crystals form reliably. But the pattern couldchange, given new information.The same process happens with social ideas and systems. New ideas, techniques orsocial arrangements create new morphogenetic fields, which make it easier formore people, as well as society as a whole, to adapt and innovate. Potentially,a few communities that have defined a new ethos of partnership and cooperationcan create a new field of possibility. As it strengthens, the new pattern couldbecome available – quickly and then suddenly – to the human community as awhole. As we know, spontaneous remissions – miraculous healings – do happen,from time to time. Just as there could be an exponential scaling up of newenergy systems, so there could be a rapid spread of new social technologies andcommunity models that shift humanity into a new framework of cooperation andempathy.When I consider the ecological data, I can’t help but feel humanity will needsomething like a miraculous healing through the coalescence of a new vision, anew consciousness, defined by regenerative practices and social habits. Ratherthan taking incremental steps, we may make a rapid evolutionary leap from ourcurrent suicide system to one that honours life and establishes a foundation ofsecure love and trust between the genders. Only this will give us the courage todeal with the onrushing tide of ecological decimation, and the socialdislocation it will cause.I realize such idealism may seem impossible and ridiculous to many readers. Iknow almost everything in our culture seems to support the alternate view thatnothing will change – that the situation is hopeless, out of our control, and itis already too late to change course. Even so, when we look back throughhistory, we have seen movements arise that took everyone by surprise. This wasthe case with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Arab Spring, the civil rightsmovement, the French and American Revolutions, and so on. We never know what ispossible – and we are more than observers. We are evolutionary catalysts whocontinuously influence what can and will occur."},{"pageContent":"9REBELLIONAll through my early life, I had the eerie feeling of being subject to asinister, overwhelming power. The enemy was a degraded, corrupt authority, muchlike the court in Kafka’s The Trial. The centre was nowhere and everywhere atthe same time. My distant nemesis could neither be targeted nor opposed.Self-expression, humour and art seemed the only meaningful way to fight backagainst such a foe. Even as adolescents, my friends and I knew our enemy hadalready won the decisive battle. Since we had lost, the best we could do was tocarve out a private realm of artistic and personal freedom where we maintainedsome illusion of control.When I was five, I remember lying on my grandma’s red upholstered couch,watching the saga of Watergate slowly unfold on her blackand- white television.I wanted cartoons, but she was determined to follow the hearings from beginningto end. Watergate was a mindnumbing drone. It was obvious to me that nobody wasspeaking directly or truthfully. The dull bureaucrats had mastered the art ofshirking responsibility and passing the buck. Everybody seemed embalmed,speaking a dead language.Watergate set the tone for my future disengagement from politics. As I grew up,I saw the system as a rigged spectacle of manufactured consent, compellingcompromise or capitulation to the special interests who pulled the puppetstrings of power. Once in a great while, I flicked a voting lever or joined insome protest march. But these gestures seemed empty, degrading. They did notfeel like meaningful forms of participation. The sensation was one of beingconned and gypped. I knew this system could never represent my values or ideals– even if I didn’t yet know precisely what my values and ideals were.By the time I came of age in the late 1980s, my Generation X had surrenderedwithout a fight. Overwhelmed by Reagan, Iran-Contras, the global success of theneoliberal agenda, we believed we were powerless to change our society. Weturned away from politics or economics.We identified as bohemians, marginal outsiders. We focused on art, film,literature and the avant-garde. Taking our cues from the culture, we greeted anyattempt to discuss the ecological crisis or America’s procession of endless warswith derision and cynicism. The suicides of Kurt Cobain and David Foster Wallaceseemed to sum up Gen X’s ambience of hopelessness.I now feel that contemporary art and culture are a bit problematic. Even whenart, films or music seems to have a dissident viewpoint, they often serve tolegitimize the prevailing system. Anything seditious, rebellious or seeminglydisruptive actually feeds energy to the postindustrial capitalist mega-machine,which thrives on disruption.Contemporary society has the ability to absorb, assimilate and neutralize almostanything that seems to threaten it. Media critic Thomas de Zengotita calls themethod through which any potential alternative or threatening idea gets‘covered’, swallowed up, by the mass media, the Blob: ‘What must be covered isany event or person or deed that might challenge the Blob with something like alimit, something the Blob cannot absorb, something that could, in resistance orescape, become the one thing the omni-tolerant Blob cannot allow, somethingoutside it, something unmediated – something real,’ he writes in Mediated.When we understand the mechanisms of post-industrial capitalism, we can use itstechniques to potentially subvert it or accelerate its metamorphosis. If weapply our cunning and creativity effectively, it is quite possible we cantransform this system peacefully from within. We don’t have to ‘smash thestate’. We can supersede it. We can feed the Blob the antidote that will forceit to dissolve.Although I consider the contemporary art world is a nightmare, a black hole ofego and pretension that sucks a huge amount of excess capital and intellect intoit, I believe art has a crucial role to play in our post-capitalist future. TheGerman conceptual artist Joseph Beuys came up with the term ‘social sculpture’.‘Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile socialsystem to build a SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART,’ Beuys wrote. We canconsider many human-made constructs – financial systems, festivals like BurningMan, intentional communities, even governments – as social sculptures, which wecan intentionally design to change ourselves or enhance our powers.We have new tools at our disposal that could allow us to accomplish what wasonce impossible and unthinkable. Ironically, yet appropriately, these tools areproducts of the system itself, which is revealing evermore glaring innercontradictions. Art could find its proper function in helping to bring aboutthis redirection. It would no longer be an ornament of post-colonial empire. Infact, if we are going to have a system after this one, art will play a far moreintegral role in it.I believe many people feel deflated, defeated and disempowered by the system soearly in life because of the failure of our world to provide us with access toanything transcendent or sacred. We are also wounded, in adolescence, by asadness around love – by the sense that men and women are somehow at war witheach other, that our deepest erotic desires are somehow shameful or wrong, andcan never be met. When we understand the programming, we can consciouslyover-write it.Instead of initiating people into adulthood through an act of visionary courage,our civilization indoctrinates and programmes us in many subtle and brutal ways.This is the residue of our Judaeo- Christian heritage, which denigrates directexperience, or gnosis, promoting received ideas and obedience to distantauthorities. In my generation, we got the impression that whoever was hidingbehind the curtain – the priest, the rabbi, the expert, the technocratbureaucrat – possessed power over our world, and that we were exiled from it.It was only after I published my first books that I realized I needed to exploresocial theory. It wasn’t enough any more to believe the government sucked andthe media was a sham – to reject the establishment, like some angst-ridden punkrocker. I needed to work out a sophisticated, reasoned critique. I needed toknow what kind of alternative I believed in – something that had nothing to dowith being a Democrat or Republican. I knew our society was approaching atipping point that might lead to catastrophic breakdown within a few decades,but I didn’t know what I would put in its place, or how this might happen.OccupyTo define a political philosophy for myself, I undertook a brainstraining,labyrinthine course of study. I pitted Hannah Arendt’s On Revolution againstLenin’s State and Revolution and surveyed Marx, Trotsky and Mao. I juxtaposedRousseau’s views on power against Machiavelli’s, tried to understand theconcepts of sovereignty and the general will, pitted Antonio Negri’s ideas of‘immaterial production’ against Slavoj Žižek’s postmodern Marxism. I analysedsocial ecologists like Murray Bookchin, post-collapse theorists like JohnMichael Greer, anarchists like Kropotkin, liberal environmentalists like BillMcKibben and Gustave Speth. Years passed as I got more and more lost in aseemingly endless tangle of theories.Suddenly, it was the autumn of 2011. Occupy Wall Street appeared on my doorstep.By the time I visited Zuccotti Park, the carnival was in full swing, with linesof police facing the young, cheerful, underwashed horde that had turned the tinysquare into their motley home. The first reports from the media made it soundsqualid and chaotic, a useless gathering of neurotic losers, with nothing betterto do. As I found, this was far from the actual state of things.For David Graeber, an anarchist and anthropology professor who helped inspirethe movement, Occupy was the local expression of a ‘wave of resistance sweepingthe planet’, part of a global response to imperial control and financialcorruption. The plan, he writes in The Democracy Project, was to create themodel for a ‘genuine direct democracy’ which would expose the charade of thecurrent representational system. The Occupiers did this by launching the GeneralAssembly. Meeting at the front of the park every day, by a tall orange metalsculpture, they made all their decisions transparently and collectively. Anyonewho turned up could immediately participate.Occupy applied Gandhi’s tactics of nonviolent activism. These tactics had notbeen successfully used in the US since the civil rights movement in the 1950s –other uprisings had attempted to apply them but were quickly stomped out. Forwhatever reason – whether it was because it was the lucky or right moment orthey needed a new story, or because mainstream journalists sympathized with theradicals – the press flocked to Occupy, giving it copious attention, whichprovided it with some protection from police aggression.As I toured the bustling park, I was amazed by the quality of people’sdiscussions, and the passion everyone expressed. It felt surreal – as if all ofthe conversations I had been holding inside my head with long-dead philosopherswere suddenly being performed publicly, witnessed by a crowd of engagedparticipants. Everyone who attended the nightly General Assemblies had the sameopportunity to debate, discuss and contribute to decisions that impacted on themovement as a whole.I saw passers-by – office workers and labourers – recruited to help build a newdemocratic society. I watched their faces light up, as they realized they werebeing invited to participate as equals in this process. There was electricity inthe air – a sense of renewed possibility.I remember, at one midday teach-in near the library, hearing two young womenwith matching dreadlocks and wire-frame glasses – they had dropped out ofcollege to join the occupation – talk about what they were learning by living inZuccotti Park. They called it a process of internal ‘decolonization’. They werefreeing their minds, step by step, from the trance of empire. They said therewere no experts in what they were experiencing, as they lived in the thick ofit. Many Occupiers had a deep understanding of our political-economic system,and the planetary crisis. They knew the situation required a seismic shift andwere willing to risk their lives for it.Graeber notes that Occupy was, at its heart, a ‘forward-looking youth movement’.Its primary constituents were young people who had tried to make it in themainstream, only to find the system rigged against them. They ‘watched thefinancial class completely fail to play by the rules, destroy the world economythrough fraudulent speculation, get rescued by prompt and massive governmentintervention, and, as a result, wield even greater power and be treated witheven greater honour than before, while they are relegated to a life ofapparently permanent humiliation’.Reform or Revolution?The handling of the 2008 crash radicalized a generation of young people smartenough to realize the current system is in a doomspiral. They are willing totransform what we have – to replace it with something truly humane, just andecologically sustainable. During the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, the Occupydemographic emerged, for the first time, as a political force, impelling BernieSanders to prominence. Despite the efforts of the government, the media and thefinancial sector to confuse the matter, millions upon millions are awakening torealize that the system we have is not working for them but is engineered toserve the interests of a small, elite group. We will probably see increasingpolarization in the next years, as authoritarian movements also gain traction.Graeber believes the distinction between reform and revolution has vanished inthe United States over the last decades. Since the 1960s, the US hastransitioned from a manufacturing-based economy to one based primarily on thesale of financial products and services. Financial products and services have nointrinsic or tangible value, since nothing is produced by them. Products likebonds, as well as ‘junk bonds’, can yield tremendous rewards – but these rewardsactually amount to a re-appropriation of resources. Wealth is extracted from thepoor and middle class and transferred to the elite group of speculators andhedge-fund managers at the top of the pyramid, who control the money supplythrough the Federal Reserve and other central banks.As a result of this systemic transition, the US economy became ‘little more thanan elaborate system of extraction, ultimately backed up by the power of thecourts, prisons, and police and the government’s willingness to grant tocorporations the power to create money’, writes Graeber. At the top of thepyramid, financial, corporate and government interests collude to maintain arigid, centralized system that works against the interests of the debt-burdenedmultitude. ‘In America, challenging the role of money in politics is bydefinition a revolutionary act because bribery has become the organizingprinciple of public life.’In 2008, we witnessed the meltdown of the global financial system due to thecollapse of mortgage-backed securities. While millions lost their homes, the USgovernment bailed out the banks and financial institutions, creating anever-ballooning burden of debt that can never be repaid. But rather thanaddressing the underlying flaws in the system, the government committed‘American taxpayers to permanent, blind support of an ungovernable,unregulatable, hyperconcentrated new financial system that exacerbates the greedand inequality that caused the crash, and forces Wall Street banks like GoldmanSachs and Citigroup to increase risk rather than reduce it’,’ journalist MattTaibbi wrote in Rolling Stone.Virtually none of the money given to the banks in the various stimulus packagesand bailouts went to the homeowners or small businesses who were impacted by thesystem’s malfeasance. ‘Instead of liquidating and prosecuting the insolventinstitutions that took us all down with them in a giant Ponzi scheme,’ Taibbipoints out, ‘we have showered them with money and guarantees and all sorts ofother enabling gestures.’ The initial $800 billion bailout was only thebeginning. Up until recently, the Federal Reserve has created, ex nihilo – outof nothing – $85 billion a month, using this credit to buy Treasury Bonds andmortgage-backed securities.What this amounts to, according to journalist Chris Hedges, is the failure ofthe constitutional state – the checks and balances which were part of theoriginal government of the United States have been overridden by financialinterests, who control the levers of power. ‘The collapse of the constitutionalstate, presaged by the death of the liberal class, has created a power vacuumthat a new class of speculators, war profiteers, gangsters and killers,historically led by charismatic demagogues, will enthusiastically fill,’ Hedgeswrites. ‘It opens the door to overtly authoritarian and fascist movements.’ As Iwrite this book, Donald Trump has stepped through that door. There may be worseto come.What has money become in our day and age? Money is a collective agreement thatmoney is worth what the banks say it is worth. It has no intrinsic value, nor isit linked to anything tangible. The bankers and the administrators of theFederal Reserve and other central banks speak a complex technical language,difficult for most people to understand or follow. This is intentional. If thesituation was made clear, people would, in all likelihood, rise up against it.I meet a lot of people who claim to be ‘spiritual’. They have impressive yogapractices, visit shamans deep in the Amazon, attend raw food retreats, ten-daysilent meditations, spend megabucks on all sorts of workshops to heal themselvesand develop their inner self. Personally, I found many of the twenty-somethingsliving in tents in Zuccotti Park, hanging out at local fast-food restaurants toget warm and eating donated pizza, to be more truly ‘spiritual’ than the peoplefrom the yoga, post-New Age or transformational festival scenes. The Occupierswere not just talking about unified consciousness and justice as some abstractideal. They courageously risked their lives and their future to protest aboutour unjust society, seeking to build something better.Occupy at first had a festive, numinous quality to it – like the last stand ofthe Mohicans, or the opening of a portal into another dimension. With ZuccottiPark, the Occupiers found an acupuncture point at the solar plexus of empire,just a few blocks from Ground Zero, across the street from Wall Street, theiconic capital of world greed, and punctured it. The brave act of a handful ofyouthful anarchists garnered global attention, sparking hundreds of copycatoccupations across the world, summoning forth a Dostoevskian cavalcade of thewise and wounded, lost and disoriented, enraged and cogent. It was raggedyBuster Keaton pitted against a grim-faced army of RoboCops.Friends from various stages of my life in New York and my years at Burning Manresurfaced as regulars at Occupy, working in the kitchen, running the library orcheerfully pedalling the bicycle generators that powered the media centre’slaptops and cameras. Some friends went out at night to project anti-capitalistslogans on skyscrapers or joined in morning actions where dozens of protestors,dressed as janitors, brought brooms down to Wall Street and swept it out.Democracy and AnarchyWhen commentators criticized the movement for lacking clear demands, they weremissing the point. Occupy was not, in its essence, a protest movement. It was aprocess movement. The Occupiers were seeking to build a new political system,based in direct participation, to supersede and replace the twisted version ofpseudo-democracy we have now. Their goal was not reform. It was revolution – ananarchist revolution, giving power to the people.As Graeber and other writers note, anarchy tends to be misunderstood. Anarchy isactually the most direct and egalitarian form of democracy, based on buildingconsensus without coercion, recognizing the autonomy of everyone involved.Anarchist writers are often brilliant at summoning up their vision of a trulyliberated society, what it would feel like and how it would operate. Instead ofsupporting institutions that become rigid, hierarchic and corrupt, anarchismwould inspire continuous flux and immediate participation. What’s interesting isthat our new communications tools could facilitate such a system in a way thatwas never possible before.Pyotr Kropotkin, a Russian prince who lived in the late nineteenth century,defined anarchism as ‘the most complete development of individuality combinedwith the highest development of voluntary association in all its aspects, in allpossible degrees, for all imaginable aims; ever-changing, ever-modifiedassociations which carry in themselves the elements of their durability andconstantly assume new forms which answer best to the multiple aspirations ofall’. An anarchist society would be one ‘to which pre-established forms,crystallized by law, are repugnant; which looks for harmony in an ever-changingand fugitive equilibrium between a multitude of varied forces and influences ofevery kind, following their own course’. For Kropotkin, who was a biologist,such a society would be based on nature’s principles.Gandhi, similarly, looked towards a future condition where there would be nopolitical power – no machinery of the state: ‘Representatives will becomeunnecessary if the national life becomes so perfect as to be self-controlled. Itwill then be a state of enlightened anarchy in which each person will become hisown ruler.’ Gandhi thought the ideal state would have ‘no political institutionand therefore no political power’. The ideal state, in other words, would be theone that no longer exists. I find this an exciting prospect.The commonly held belief is that we need government and the state to preventterror and chaos. Do we really know this to be the case any more? Historyreveals the state to be guilty of endless dark deeds and scorched-earthpolicies. The US government has laid waste to whole nations, causing the deathand dislocation of large populations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Iraq,using napalm, Agent Orange and shells of depleted uranium to further itsgeopolitical aims. Could no government do any worse?Thinkers like Albert Camus and Hannah Arendt draw a sharp distinction betweenrebellion and revolution: ‘Rebellion’s demand is unity; historical revolution’sdemand is totality,’ wrote Camus. The tendency of historical revolution is todemand the ‘absolute negation’ of its subjects, leading to ideological purity,mass murder and slavery without limit. The communist revolutions of the lastcentury obliterated the individual, turning people into puppets of the state,forced to fulfil the inhuman dictates of a mega-machine. Camus preferredrebellion as a model.Today, the radical reinvention of society – by global insurgency, massawakening, spiritual intervention – seems necessary. It is something we mustdemand and enact. If we don’t, there may be no future for humanity. But themodels provided by past revolutions are outmoded, old hat. They won’t serve usany more. So what can we do?I don’t think we can simply dissolve the governments we have now, as that wouldcreate chaos. But is it possible that we might engineer a peaceful step-by-steptransition from governments controlled by wealthy elites where participation islimited, to a peer-to-peer system where local communities have autonomy, wherepower is decentralized, where we peacefully dissolve nation-state borders, wherethe people are free to be? I know this seems impossible. But so did a smartphone, 3D printer or neutron bomb until somebody built the thing.Why don’t we at least make this thought experiment? Until now, our focus hasbeen technological progress, not social innovation. Our society has been focusedon making things that make profit, not on reinventing our social system tosupport the greatest level of happiness, self-knowledge and freedom for all.What would happen if we changed our focus?Our networks of communication could be used to orchestrate a worldwide campaignof education. As we teach the people of the world about what’s happeningecologically, we will also train them in participatory democracy, as well asecological restoration. We know that the collective consciousness is shaped bythe media. Therefore, we can feasibly use media to point people in a newdirection – one that allows us all to thrive. What I am proposing as the idealis something like a holistic anarchism, where we apply the existing tools ofpostindustrial society – the tools of media, communication, industry andmanufacturing – efficiently to construct a unified, peaceful planetary culturebased on principles of ecological restoration and decentralized, local autonomy.In actual fact, the United States has never experienced true democracy, excepton a small scale, in townships. The American political system from the outsetwas carefully orchestrated to maintain wealth, privilege and elite controlthrough a system of representation. In the Declaration of Independence, Americais not defined as a democracy, but, explicitly, as a republic. James Madisonwrote: ‘In a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person; ina republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents.A democracy, consequently, must be confined to a small spot. A republic may beextended over a large region.’ The US government became the model for othernation-states to follow over the next centuries.Madison, like most of the Founding Fathers, argued that true democracy wouldlead inevitably to mob rule, factionalism and despotism. He feared what hecalled ‘the horrors of democracy’. Given the power, the multitudes wouldundermine the structure of elite privilege and private property that theFounding Fathers, as landholders and legislators, wanted to maintain – and thattheir descendants have held to this day.I agree with the Founding Fathers: if we establish a direct democracy where allpeople have an equal say, elite power and privilege will be dissolved,eventually. There will no longer be such extremes of wealth inequality, andeveryone – including the super-rich – will be much happier because of it. Idon’t think a planetary democracy would disintegrate into mob rule or despotism,or some grim form of communism. As Rebecca Solnit discovered when she visitedformer disaster zones, when governments collapse the vast majority of people actmore altruistically and compassionately towards others. They come togetherorganically in communities and local democracies. This pattern is repeated againand again.We seem to be quickly approaching that threshold where, as the social ecologistMurray Bookchin warned, our world ‘will either undergo revolutionary changes, sofar-reaching in character that humanity will totally transform its socialrelations and its very conception of life, or it will suffer an apocalypse thatmay well end humanity’s tenure on the planet’. This process will only befinished when humanity no longer exists on Earth, or when we have established ajust and humane society, liberated from artificial scarcity and free ofdomination.Occupy represented the emergence of a new social organism, based on directdemocracy and consensus. Like a windblown seed from a hothouse flower, Occupyinfiltrated the control zone of imperial power, found a crack in the concrete,took root and suddenly blossomed. During the occupation, Zuccotti Parkfunctioned as a new social organism.The chaotic appearance of the park as a shanty town or tent city masked awell-defined order. In a short period of time, the Occupiers turned theirtemporary autonomous zone into a tightly organized command-and-control centrewith sectors designated for particular functions. Within its small radius,Occupy included areas for public debate, education, communication, drumming,meditation, waste management, rest and so on. It was much like a cell, withinternal functions, maintaining a permeable boundary with the world around it.Occupy Wall Street constantly incorporated new molecules – in the form ofcurious strangers – from the outside. Either visitors would circulate out again,or they would find their function within the cell’s metabolism and stay put.Spontaneous EvolutionLet’s consider what’s happening – and what we might make happen – through thelens of evolutionary biology. Long ago, the trillions of cellular entities andmicroorganisms that make up our bodies were competing with each other, devouringeach other, as they blindly sought to grow and reproduce. Through a series ofcrises – through an evolutionary process of trial and error – they found theycould further their interests by cooperating with each other. They learned todevise more complex structures, like eyes, bones, muscles and skin.Spontaneous Evolution is a collaboration between Bruce Lipton, a cell biologist,and Steve Bhaerman, a political philosopher. They believe we are being impelledtowards our next stage of planetary civilization, marked by interdependence. Wewill learn to coordinate our functions within the symbiotic super-organism madeup of humanity as a whole in a harmonic relationship with the Earth’s ecology.As an analogy, they consider the process of the caterpillar becoming abutterfly. In the chrysalis, the caterpillar doesn’t just sprout wings. After ithas devoured all of the food surrounding it, the caterpillar’s entire body meltsdown into a biotic goop. The code for the transmutation of the organism is heldby a handful of ‘imaginal cells’ that begin to propagate as the caterpillardissolves. At first, the dying caterpillar’s immune system attacks the imaginalcells, but this only strengthens them. As they multiply, they install theoperating code for the transforming organism.‘When provided with a new awareness,’ write Lipton and Bhaerman, ‘the cellularpopulation that comprises the deteriorating larva collaborates to restructuretheir society in order to experience the next highest level of their evolution.’We have to hope that at the inevitable end of the metamorphosis of humansociety, we will have a live butterfly, not a dead moth – or an army of robotflies.Biology reveals a pattern of fractal self-similarity on different scales andlevels of complexity. Immature ecosystems are characterized by competition andaggression, while mature ecosystems are based on cooperation and sharing: ourown bodies provide an example of this. They follow the same principle defined bythe United States’ original slogan: ‘e pluribus unum’ – ‘from the many, one’.Evolution does not happen incrementally. Crises induce sudden mutations andrapid leaps. These leaps represent ‘an evolution of increasing levels ofcommunal complexity and interrelationships’. Theoretically, humans are on theverge of making a jump to collective harmony, modelled on the coordinatedactivity that happens within our bodies, which work together to support thesuccess of the whole without wasting or hoarding energy. That is what thepattern of evolution suggests.Unless we wipe ourselves out entirely, I think it is inevitable. The onlyquestion, actually, is the time-scale and the amount of destruction that willoccur before we make this transition. It could take hundreds or thousands ofyears (which are tiny segments of time, compared to the millions and billions ofyears of evolution), during which the human population may crash drastically dueto ecological catastrophe – perhaps down to a few hundred million or less. Abetter option is that we use our current infrastructure to bring about thischange in our current lifespans, sparing our human family untold misery andsuffering.What we will see in the future is not a further biological evolution ofindividual humans – we won’t suddenly mutate to be able to breathe methane andeat plastic – but a social evolution, facilitated by technologies and socialtechnologies. Breaking through the current obstacles posed by governments, thefinancial system, the cult of profit and hyper-individuality, we will learn tobuild durable communities. A community is an assembly of individuals sharing thesame interests and seeking the same goals – which can be as simple as apeaceful, happy life. Just like the microorganisms in our bodies, which gave upsome degree of autonomy to become integrated within a greater whole, we willform communities to gain increased self-awareness and resilience – to enhanceour happiness.In Non-Zero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Robert Wright similarly proposes thatevolution reveals a direction, pointing towards humanity becoming a harmonicplanetary super-organism, a holon made up of nested holons. We are, inexorably,becoming a planetary community that orchestrates itself in an ever-more harmonicand unified way. ‘As technology continues to shorten economic distance, thelogical scope of supranational governance could conceivably become the wholeplanet,’ he writes. Where I differ with Wright is that the kind of‘supranational governance’ he envisions seems like the neoliberal New WorldOrder taken to the next level. Instead of more corporate globalization, we canchoose to reinvent our political and social systems to support local autonomyand bioregionalism within a truly planetary framework.According to the postmodern worldview, as alienated individuals, we fight tomaximize our personal advantage in a cutthroat world. The reductive scientificparadigm sees the universe as mechanistic, with genes as the master moleculesdetermining our fate, but the new vision from biology is one of interdependenceand symbiosis instead of cutthroat competition.Much like single-celled organisms hundreds of millions of years ago, we findourselves at a threshold where we must overcome our sense of separate identityto evolve new social organs. To survive, we must overcome limited self-interestand learn to cooperate for the benefit of the whole. This requires a change inour social nature.As a new paradigm, epigenetics overturns the mechanistic ideology, presented byRichard Dawkins and others, that sees DNA as ‘the selfish gene’ or the ‘mastermolecule’ which controls the organism’s behaviour. The DNA code within a cellcan produce tens of thousands of proteins. How genes express themselves, whatproteins they produce, depends on the cell’s relationship with its environment,as the cell chooses, in a sense, what to incorporate into the cell’s metabolismthrough its permeable membrane, based on cues it picks up from its surroundings.In other words, instead of being helpless captives of our genes, we have greatpower to influence both our health and our environment, if we can reckon withthe subconscious programmes that guide much of our behaviour.If we are going to make a leap to a new state of consciousness and socialsystem, we must overcome the subconscious beliefs that distort our perceptionsof our world and ourselves. At the moment, a great proportion of our behaviouris controlled by invisible ghosts, phantoms from the past. These ghosts limitpeople’s awareness of their innate potential – their capacity to see their worldclearly, heal themselves and work together for humanity’s collective benefit.This is another reason that our self-transformation requires a spiritualevolution, an opening of consciousness, not just a political change.Occult ConspiracySo far, I have tried to be as honest as possible about what I personally believeis happening to our world. I have suggested we can see the ecological crisis asan initiation and also as a necessary stage in our evolution as a species. Tome, it seems that nature has not abandoned us, but has orchestrated thistransition. The best I can do is give you my best efforts to understand oursituation, holding nothing back. As I said earlier, you don’t have to agree withme about everything.I have been primarily focused on the material and tangible aspects of ourplight, but I think we should consider also the occult or invisible forces thatmay be involved, without overdoing or belabouring an examination of thisquestion. Some writers, such as David Icke or John Lash, believe that humanityis currently controlled by off-planet or extra-terrestrial forces. This is alsodiscussed or alluded to in many ancient works.The Gnostics are often thought to be a sect of Christianity. In fact, theGnostics were not Christian heretics. They carried the knowledge of the ancientMystery Schools, which were brought to an end when the Roman Empire adoptedChristianity in the fourth century ad. The Gnostics thought this world was anillusion – much like the simulated reality of The Matrix – constructed bydeviant spirits, which they called the Archons, ruled by a cruel, derangedDemiurge. The Archons sought to compel humanity to believe in them, and to denythe existence of a true reality that we can only find through our personalefforts. In the Gnostic Gospels, Christ says, ‘Open the door for yourself, soyou will know what is.’ But as Christianity merged with the Roman Empire, itenforced faith and obedience, rather than self-knowledge.According to Lash, the Gnostics recognized the rise of Christianity as adeviation from spiritual truth. They believed it was devised by the Archons, whowanted to maintain control of humanity. When the Gnostics tried to educate thepeople and sound the alarm, they were killed – brutally assassinated, burnt atthe stake. The priests used methods of indoctrination to control the people, inplace of initiatory techniques.David Icke believes that humanity was manipulated by extraterrestrials at somepoint in our past. We were intended to be a slave species. These aliens eitherinterbred with, or perhaps performed genetic experiments on, our primate orhominid ancestors. He thinks the ruling families – many of whom can trace theirfamily trees back to early Roman emperors – are focused on bloodlines, becausethey can trace their genetic descent back to our alien, reptilian overlords. Thetrace of this heritage is the combination of genius with sociopathy. I find thisan interesting thesis, but too literal and one-dimensional.The alchemical philosopher Patrick Harpur looks at our situation differently. Hequestions the basis of modern, mental–rational consciousness. We have aninveterate tendency to believe that things must be either literal or imaginary,true or false. We are trapped in either–or dualism. Traditional and aboriginalcultures don’t share this bias.‘Traditional societies do not distinguish between myth and history in the waythat we do. Mythical events were not thought to have literally happened; yet inanother sense they were true, as if they had,’ Harpur writes. He quoted anancient author, Sallust (86–34 bc), who wrote: ‘These things never happened;they are always.’ I believe we will attain the next level of consciousness as aspecies – overcoming the limits of mental–rational postmodernity – when weintegrate the scientific worldview with this traditional perspective. We willtransition from a dualistic viewpoint to an integral realization, accepting theparadoxical nature of reality.Even our belief in a linear cause and effect is ultimately an act of faith. Theuniverse might be organized on principles that are quite different from what weunderstand or imagine. The effect might precede the cause, as Nietzsche noted.‘History is that mythical variant we have chosen to take literally,’ Harpurasserts.By gaining initiation into the spiritual worlds, people realize the world is acosmic illusion, ultimately a dream, as Tibetan Lamas remind us, as 5-meO-DMTdirectly reveals. Paradoxically, this doesn’t make the world any less importantor ‘real’. The dream we are in is our precious opportunity for learning andawakening, for evolving spiritually. As it is in dreams, time may not be aslinear or as straightforward as we believe it to be. There may, indeed, be otherforces – powers or principalities – who seek to manipulate humanity, as theGnostics believed; who play with us through history. But these forces are also,in the end, projections of our psyche.PronoiaIf only one consciousness unfolds its creative capacities through all of us,then everything we experience as a nemesis or an opponent is actually a helperor a teacher in disguise. We have more reason to be ‘pronoiac’ than paranoiac.Pronoia is a concept developed by the astrologer Rob Brezsny. He thinks theuniverse is actually conspiring, at every step, to give us the most amazingexperience we can handle at that moment.I tend to agree with Brezsny, but I also think pronoia only makes sense – theworld seems more pronoiac to a California dreamer than a Somalian refugee – ifwe also integrate Eastern ideas of karma and reincarnation. According to thesewisdom traditions, our souls pass through many lifetimes; our actions in onelifetime determine our opportunities in future lives. Physics has demonstrated‘quantum nonlocality’, where particles remain connected, even across vastdistances, indicating that time itself is an illusion. Perhaps as we extend ourknowledge of the quantum world, we will gain deeper ways of conceiving phenomenathat are now considered mystical, such as reincarnation, or the chakra system.If space and time are tools of our animal understanding, if they don’t exist inreality – a reality defined by quantum nonlocality – then what we call a ‘pastlife’ might be more like resonance with an energy cluster. A particular set ofexperiences, feelings and thoughts might leave an imprint or remain connectedthrough the quantum world. The subtle bodies and esoteric energy centres couldhave substance through consciousness itself, held in a morphogenetic field.What some left-wing critics call ‘empire’ is a projection of our collective ego.The ego seeks control and solidity and can’t admit these are illusions. In TheWizard of Oz, Dorothy discovers that a frightening spectacle of omnipotence iscreated by a little man hidden behind a curtain. We are in that situation today.The little man represents all of our fears and inadequacies, our lack of faithin our own powers.In our society, a tiny group – the ruling elite, dubbed the 1 per cent byOccupiers – run the financial institutions, the mass media, the energycorporations. Seeking to maintain their power and control, this group employsexperts in persuasion and propaganda, neurolinguistic programming and socialpsychology. It has inherited a whole structure of empire that is based onindoctrinating people, controlling them through artificial scarcity andviolence, and keeping them ignorant, divided, disempowered, acting against theirown interests. Now this control system is reaching its limit, confronting anobstacle which it can’t control or assimilate.I could go much further down this rabbit hole. I could look at the connectionsbetween the Bavarian Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Yale secret society Skulland Bones, and so on. I could consider the nihilistic worship of power assomething occult and, in Steiner’s terms, Ahrimanic. I don’t think it will behelpful. Conspiracy theories have a hypnotizing, fixating quality. They can beprofoundly disempowering.I do not doubt there are many levels of conspiracy and complicity among those inpower. Some of them may have an occult understanding of our situation. Some maybe literal Satanists. Some may believe they have contacts with entities, Gods orgrey aliens, that are not from this world. Whether this is true or not, itdoesn’t mean we can avoid our responsibility or abdicate our agency.I recognize there are very strange, sinister worlds relegated to the culturalmargins. These range from well-documented satanic rituals of child abuse amongBritish Members of Parliament to semi-credible reports on treaties andtechnology transfers between the US government and extra-terrestrials. But theselevels of subterranean connection and conspiratorial shadows are nothingcompared to much more unbelievable facts. Among these is the fact that we existat all (on a planet spinning around a star at 67,000 mph, as that star spinsaround the centre of the Milky Way at 450,000 mph), that the moon and the sunappear to be the same size in the sky and form perfect eclipses, that therelationships between the orbits of our planets weave perfect harmonic patternsaccording to Phi-based ratios, and so on.Previous civilizations such as the Aztec, classic Maya and Egyptian understoodthat dark and light were complementary principles and both needed to be honouredand recognized. They created initiatory paths for those innately attracted tosorcery, malevolence and cruelty, as well as those who used ritual magic forbenevolent ends and healing purposes. Mesoamerican cultures had templesdedicated to Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan – a creator deity who protected life – aswell as places to worship Tezcatlipoca, the god of black magic and the jaguar.In this way, those with innately destructive or sociopathic tendencies wereintegrated into the social order. By denying this polarity, monotheisticreligions like Christianity actually empowered those with sociopathic tendenciesto become leaders of society as a whole. If we are going to restore the sacreddimension to post-postmodern civilization, we will have to find a way toacknowledge the power of darkness, but place it within a system that allows thebenevolent forces of light to guide, guard and rule.In the transition from ancient myth-based societies to modern civilization, welost ceremonies and rituals of initiation, while the priests and ruling elitesdesigned a social structure based on hierarchical control and indoctrination,which kept the power in their hands, forcing the masses into obedience. In orderfor humanity to survive and eventually thrive, we must bring about a polarreversal of this system by creating a new synthesis, using its tools andtechniques to bring about our freedom. As we will explore, there are manyreasons to believe we can engineer this transformation."},{"pageContent":"10REVOLUTIONWhen the spirit of revolution arises in the people, it promises to change notonly the outer world but also the inner domain of thought, dream and desire. Thedesire for revolution is the yearning for the decisive event that separatesdream and reality – the threshold when suffering is redeemed, when freedom isgained, here and now.The wait has been a long one. ‘Man is born free, and everywhere he is inchains,’ Jean-Jacques Rousseau observed, back in the eighteenth century. ‘Oneman thinks himself the master of others, but remains more of a slave than theyare.’ Rousseau’s ideas ended up shaping the French Revolution.The cry for freedom has been the persistent undertone in the music of theoppressed, those who sing for Kingdom Come, the rising of the new sun, for whomhistory is an unfinished melody or a call that awaits its response. The dream ofrevolution is a secular version of the monk’s desire for religious ecstasy,which erases the separation between subject and object, and, like fire, purifiesas it scalds, transmutes as it consumes, creates as it destroys.The Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse found civilization haunted ‘byguilt over a deed that has not been accomplished’, the deed of ‘liberation’. Mypsychedelic journeys made this so clear to me. We had got caught in an incessanttape loop of deferral and delay, an interminable ‘not yet’, in our agreementsabout reality. We betrayed the promise of past revolutions by building newprisons around ourselves – banking systems, governments, malls, corporatestructures. We lost ourselves in a labyrinth constructed by the human mind.From past revolutions, we know that ‘we, the people’, have the power to remakeor reinvent society when it no longer serves us. This remains a strange anddangerous idea. Our civilization seeks to maintain the illusion that it is solidand permanent. Architects decorate banks and government buildings with Doriccolumns, imitation Roman statues and friezes that convey the sense of an ancientpedigree. All of this display is designed to fool us into obedience andcomplacency.Revolution awakened the consciousness of mankind. People found, to their greatsurprise, that they were ‘the people’, historical actors: the subjects ofhistory, not its passive objects. ‘That all authority in the last analysis restson opinion is never more forcefully demonstrated than when, suddenly andunexpectedly, a universal refusal to obey initiates what then turns into arevolution,’ wrote the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. That is the lessonof our past. We discovered it again in 1989, when the multitudes tore down theBerlin Wall, destroying at the same time an antiquated ideology.Until the late eighteenth century, the vast majority of people believed in theDivine Right of Kings. They didn’t think of social systems as expressions ofhuman intention, or as artefacts that could be changed or redesigned. The Frenchand American Revolutions – deemed ‘the vindication of the honour of the humanrace’ by Alexander Hamilton, or ‘the grandeur of man against the pettiness ofthe great’ by Robespierre – were a shock to humanity. The people rose up tooverthrow oppressive, corrupt, autocratic regimes. Through trial and error, therevolutionaries established the model of liberal democracy we know today –imperfect but a great advance over monarchy and feudalism.Never-ending revolution remains our ideal in art, fashion and tech. Commercialsociety today requires continuous disruption, rebellion, the shock of the new.Capitalism is brilliant at absorbing anything that might threaten it. CheGuevara becomes a face on a T-shirt. The anguish of young black men is packagedas Gangsta Rap. Social outrage is turned into cultural product, moredistractions to assimilate. The energy of dissidence and rebellion feeds thesystem and keeps it running.The incessant onslaught of pop culture kitsch confuses and entrances people. Weforget society is broken, that it needs to be changed, and we are the only oneswho can change it. Made to believe we are powerless, we forfeit our power. It iseasy to forget – until some problem leads to a crisis, and the crisis reveals adesign flaw in the operating system that cannot be addressed by any reform.Our society has revealed a number of severe design flaws that cannot be fixedwithin its current operating system. One is the grotesque, evergrowing increasein wealth inequality. Economists like Thomas Piketty have shown that theaccelerated accumulation of capital by a few is built into the system. As themiddle class collapses, we are experiencing something like the return of theancien régime, a regression to a twotier society of serfs and overlords.Bill Gates and other billionaires promulgate their belief that the world isgetting better for everyone. Depending on how we look at the evidence, thisbelief seems hard to sustain. For instance, in the US the number of childrenliving in poverty has increased in the last decades, to almost one-third of allchildren. Corporate rulers and financier plutocrats are the new aristocrats,floating above the rule of law, whether they gather in secretive meetings inSwitzerland to determine the fate of the world or preen in Road Warrior-esquecostumes and gobble psychedelics at the Burning Man festival.It is true that living standards and life expectancy have gone up in some areasof the world, while poverty has increased in others. We’ve managed significantgains in some areas, but this has come at quite a cost in others. We’ve managedonly a few centuries of rapid industrial progress and we’ve accomplished thisfeat by over-exploiting the natural world, squandering finite resources thataccrued over millions of years. At the same time, the advantages of our globalindustrial monoculture are somewhat ambiguous, at best. The desperate poverty wecontinue to see around the world is a direct result of industrial civilizationand corporate globalization.The second problem, of course, is that we are careering towards ecologicalmeltdown. These design flaws are, I believe, linked. We can’t solve one withoutaddressing the other. I agree with the social ecologist Murray Bookchin that‘The private ownership of the planet by elite strata must be brought to an endif we are to survive the afflictions it has imposed on the biotic world,particularly as a result of a society structured around limitless growth,’ as hewrote in The Ecology of Freedom.We therefore need some kind of revolution, but it can’t be anything like therevolutions we have seen in the past. We need one, to quote Dieter Duhm again,‘whose victory will create no losers because it will achieve a state thatbenefits all’. We must also make it a peaceful revolution – a gentle supersedingof the current political-economic system, not an explosive insurrection againstit. We need a revolution that is, at the same time, evolution and revelation.The United States – guarding the global empire of disorder – has turned into amassive surveillance society, armed to the teeth, looking for opportunities toflex its police and military might. It has killer drones, biological weapons,neutron bombs, FlexiCuffs, Guantanamo Bay, ‘extraordinary rendition’, and myriadother forms of intimidation, torture and death at its disposal. Any effort tooppose this kind of force directly will only end in failure. With hindsight, wecan see that many of the protest and radical movements that fought ‘against’ thesystem only ended up feeding and energizing it. A different approach is calledfor.What we can do, instead, is use the current infrastructure to bring about asystemic transformation, much as the imaginal cells reprogramme the cells thatmake up the body of the dying caterpillar. Later we will consider how this canbe done in more depth. Despite its military might and seeming solidity, theempire is fragile. Our global economy is floating on air, as central bankscreate money out of nothing and debt skyrockets faster than gross domesticproduct, which is a terrible indicator in any case.The Promise of PoliticsWhat lessons should we take from the revolutions of the past? According toArendt, human beings have an innate political ability which modern society –empire – actively suppresses. Arendt was one of the most celebrated politicalphilosophers of the twentieth century. Born as a Jew in Germany, she studiedwith the philosopher Martin Heidegger, who was also her lover. A brilliantphenomenologist, Heidegger became a Nazi Party member. In 1941, Arendtimmigrated to the United States, narrowly escaping the Holocaust. As a thinker,she was extremely subtle, astonishingly wise.Arendt published her first major work, The Origins of Totalitarianism, in theearly 1950s. She outraged left-wing critics by equating Stalinism and Nazism,seeing them as equally destructive expressions of modern society. She coined thephrase ‘the banality of evil’ while reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann forthe New Yorker. In her work, Arendt sought to rehabilitate the idea of politicalaction as something that gives dignity and value to human life – action that isnecessary, if we wish to have an ethical society.Arendt changed my understanding of politics. She noted that the word ‘politics’derives from the word ‘polis’, the city-state in Ancient Greece. In a polis freecitizens gathered to deliberate, debate and make decisions together. Arendtbelieves that democracy – human freedom – needs a public place where it can bepractised, as the Occupiers demonstrated with the General Assembly in ZuccottiPark.‘Without a politically guaranteed public realm, freedom lacks the worldly spaceto make its appearance,’ Arendt wrote:To be sure it may still dwell in men’s hearts as desire or will or hope oryearning; but the human heart, as we all know, is a very dark place, andwhatever goes on in its obscurity can hardly be called a demonstrable fact.Freedom as a demonstrable fact and politics coincide and are related to eachother like two sides of the same matter.By seeming to separate freedom from politics, modern society plays a trick onus. As long as we think of freedom as a purely private and personal concern, weremain unfree.Arendt realized that Western philosophy denigrated and rejected politicalthought and action. Over 2,000 years ago, Western thinking turned away frompolitics – from action in the world – when Socrates was accused of ‘corrupting’the youth of Athens and executed because of his constant inquiry. The impact ofthis was profound for Western civilization. It was like an original trauma,causing the split between thought and action that continues. Today, we stillconceive of personal liberty as freedom from politics, rather than freedom toparticipate as authentic political beings.Jonathan Schell wrote on Arendt:Among the difficult things she came to understand was that the great thinkers towhom she turned time and again for inspiration, from Plato and Aristotle toNietzsche and Heidegger, had never seen that the promise of human freedom,whether proffered sincerely or hypocritically as the end of politics, isrealized by plural human beings when and only when they act politically.Philosophy became its own specialized realm, while politics became the path forthose seeking power in the world.What Arendt called the promise of politics begins when we understand that ourpower as political beings is a living force, rooted in our solidarity with oneanother. Electoral politics tends to be a sad spectacle of compromise andcapitulation. But that is not the real essence of politics. It is a corruptaberration. We are inherently political beings. Freedom is something we create,in collaboration and communion with each other.When she studied the history of revolutions across the modern world, Arendtdiscovered, over and over again, ‘the amazing formation of a new power structurewhich owed its existence to nothing but the organizational impulse of the peoplethemselves’.Once centralized authority disintegrates, the people establish assemblies,neighbourhood councils, cooperatives and working groups. They take overfactories and schools and run them themselves, without bosses. They practise thedirect, consensus-based decision-making found in many indigenous cultures.The disintegration of state power inspires the immediate creation of localdemocracies. Arendt called them ‘spontaneous organs of the people, not onlyoutside of all revolutionary parties but entirely unexpected by them and theirleaders’. Decisions are made by public referendums, arrived at throughconsensus. The people suddenly demonstrate ‘an enormous appetite for debate, forinstruction, for mutual enlightenment and exchange of opinion’.The first time I felt this electric surge of possibility was during the GeneralAssemblies at Occupy Wall Street. Recently the United States witnessed thepromise of a redeemed politics, based on candour and compassion, in the campaignof Bernie Sanders. His campaign has proven that the energy expressed by Occupyis still vital, seeking new outlets.Revolution is not the cause of social and political disintegration, Arendtnoted, but a consequence of it. This was true in the socialist and communistrevolutions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and even in theneoliberal ‘counter-revolutions’ of the 1990s, which helped Putin gainascendency in Russia. In On Revolution, she wrote, ‘The outbreak of mostrevolutions has surprised the revolutionist groups and parties no less than allothers, and there exists hardly a revolution whose outbreak could be blamed upontheir activities.’The revolutionaries would be hanging out in the demi-monde, skulking in thecafes of Zurich or Paris, writing their manifestos and screeds. Suddenly, socialbreakdown would start in their home country. They would return – Lenin wasactually transported on a private train through Europe, to help accelerateRussia’s collapse – to foment, infiltrate and take over. The professionalrevolutionaries’ great advantage, Arendt noted, was not their intellectualtheories or organizational talents, but ‘the simple fact that their names arethe only ones which are publicly known’.Arendt believed that the professional revolutionaries, full of ideological zeal,often destroyed the rapid evolution of participatory democracy that had started,as if it were a natural phenomenon, as soon as government was gone. Given power,the revolutionaries immediately established new forms of authoritarian rule ordictatorship, following abstract principles from Marx, Rousseau or Mao. Whenthey gained control, they crushed the new assemblies established by the people.They identified these democratic organs quickly as the greatest threat to theircontrol. When ‘the people in the sections were made only to listen to partyspeeches and to obey’, Arendt wrote, ‘they simply ceased to show up’.Historians before Arendt ‘failed to understand to what an extent the councilsystems confronted them with a new public space for freedom which wasconstituted and organized during the course of the revolution itself’. Thispattern has recurred, again and again, in modern and postmodern times. InFrance, a citizen’s government formed during the Paris Commune of 1871. InRussia, local councils emerged across the country during the early days of therevolution in 1917. For Arendt, councils and workers’ assemblies were theembryonic forms of an entirely new system of government based on continuous,passionate participation that could have made the gains of revolution permanent.When the Argentinian currency collapsed in 2001, the people gathered in schoolsand factories to organize their neighbourhoods. Workers took over the factoriesand continued production, forming cooperatives without overseers. Roughly athird of the Argentinian populace participated in General Assemblies, organizinglocally to maintain systems for healthcare and food distribution.Most recently, in Iceland, after the financial crisis of 2008, the peoplerejected the draconian dictates of the International Monetary Fund, choosinginstead to evict the bankers responsible for the country’s financial crisis.Using the Internet to hold a public referendum, they wrote a new, open-sourceconstitution, declaring their country a haven for free information.Crisis Is OpportunityIt is possible that the next revolution will never come. Although we are in amassive, out-of-control civilization barrelling towards ecological breakdown,the current system is also intricately interdependent and hyper-defended. Whilethe underlying mechanism of the global financial system is broken, while shadowywebs of conspiracy and corruption extend everywhere, while billionairefinanciers toast their own cleverness as millions lose their homes, while theplanet’s ecosystems buckle and collapse, it may be the case that our globaloligarchy will manage to hold it all together for a while yet – like Major Kongin Doctor Strangelove, with a final ‘Yee haw!’, riding the bomb all the waydown.On the other hand, some series of unforeseeable events may create an opportunityfor a massive, sudden change. Social experiments currently proliferate all overthe world. They are happening in many countries, often as a result of theextractive practices and domination of empire. In southern Europe, wherecountries like Greece, Spain and Italy have undergone financial collapse, newpolitical parties are emerging, based on grassroots activism. Finland is testingout a basic income. Many movements around the world, from La Via Campesina (thelandless peasant movement in Brazil) to the Zapatistas in Chiapas, are startinginnumerable local actions, from time-banking systems and worker-ownedcooperatives to community farms. The hundreds of thousands, if not millions, ofsmall-scale actions, occupations and resistance movements around the world couldweave themselves together, causing the spontaneous emergence of a new socialbeing.We therefore need to understand what is at stake, and what is possible – even atthe furthest edges of possibilities. If we don’t have a plan or a new modelready, a social breakdown or series of disasters may only lead to new forms ofdespotic control and intensified repression, which will ensure furtherecological breakdown.Milton Friedman, the leading neoliberal economist, understood this. ‘Only acrisis – actual or perceived – produces real change,’ he wrote. ‘When thatcrisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lyingaround. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives toexisting policies, to keep them alive and available until the politicallyimpossible becomes the politically inevitable.’ In the 1970s and 80s, Friedmanand his fellow economists developed their model of intensive privatization,arguing that ‘free markets’ created the greatest benefit for all.When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed, economists andadvisers from the US rushed into the void. Inspired by Friedman’s ideas, theyenforced privatization on a mass scale, convincing governments in eastern Europeand Russia to sell off stateowned resources and institutions to the highestbidder. A tiny elite appropriated the shared wealth of the commons, creating anoligarchy that led to the dictatorial rise of Vladimir Putin.Radicals can learn from the Pyrrhic victory of Friedman and the neoliberals.Rather than stumbling blindly forward, we must define, in advance, the outcomeswe desire – much as the Wright Brothers worked towards an aeroplane, or SteveJobs organized Apple to produce the iPhone. Then we must define a strategic planto attain our goal.What we want, I believe, is to launch a social infrastructure that supportsparticipatory democracy to grow and take root organically, without gettingsnuffed out by ideologues of the right or left. We also want to devise a systemwhere resources are shared far more equitably. The goal should be apost-capitalist society where distributed manufacturing, renewable energy,participatory democracy, efficient cooperation and conservation combine with auniversal subsidy or basic income to guarantee everyone on Earth – our humanfamily as a whole – the opportunity for a good life, free of unnecessaryinsecurity and pointless suffering.Revolution2.0As it widens the ‘metabolic rift’ between humanity and nature in its insatiablequest for more profit, for endless growth, capitalism has revealed a fataldesign flaw. There is nothing in its internal logic to interrupt its momentum –to stop it eating its way through our planet, and ultimately collapsing ourglobal ecosystems. Therefore, we must intervene and redirect it. The only way todo this is to make the global population aware of the dilemma, while those withthe technical and creative capability design, field-test and distribute afunctional alternative.I find it helpful to look at the problem – as if we are seeing it from outside,like space aliens observing the Earth from an observatory on a moon of Jupiter –through the paradigm of design. When designers want to make something new, theyexpect they will have to build and field-test a series of versions andprototypes. When the first model breaks down, they build a second version. Whenthat version fails, they create another. They keep iterating until they get itright. Artists similarly experiment in their studio, destroying or painting overtheir failed attempts until their vision emerges.When it comes to building a social, or a political-economic, system, humanityhas followed these steps – experimenting, building a prototype, field-testingit, discovering where the model breaks down, developing a new prototype,experimenting, field-testing, watching it fail and so on – over and over.Unfortunately, however, when the current version of society crashes, it doesn’thappen in the laboratory or studio. It takes place across the much broadercanvas of nation-states and civilizations. It tragically utilizes human beings –swarms, masses of them – as its Jackson Pollock-like splatters and drips.Perhaps the greatest systems thinker of the twentieth century was the designscientist Buckminster Fuller. Fuller combined two strains of American thought,transcendental idealism and pragmatism, in a long career. He was a prolificinventor, mathematician and visionary. He passed through his own initiation as ayoung man, contemplating suicide at the age of 32, after the death of a belovedchild. He decided that, rather than kill himself, he would dedicate his life toaccomplishing the greatest good for humanity, without thought or considerationfor personal gain. Fuller wrote many books expounding his philosophy, includingSynergetics, Critical Path, Operation Spaceship Earth, and Utopia and Oblivion –they remain very relevant today.In the 1960s, Fuller foresaw only two possible outcomes for humanity: we wouldeither continue our current social and political arrangements and soon destroyourselves, or we would undergo a design revolution in every arena. As part ofthis design revolution, we would apply our technical powers to allocateresources efficiently, working together to elevate everyone on Earth to a highstandard of living and education. Even a half-century ago, he saw that wealready possessed the technical means as well as the resources to do this. Butthe opportunity has been blocked by the inertia of our out-of-date political andfinancial arrangements, as well by as the ideology behind this antiquatedsystem.‘All who are really dedicated to the earliest possible attainment of economicand physical success for all humanity – and thereby realistically to eliminatework – will have to shift their focus from the political arena to participationin the design revolution,’ he wrote.Fuller believed that the current model of work would be abolished in a trulyrational society. I wholeheartedly agree with him. Deep down, nobody wants a jobto occupy so much of their time. People want a mission that inspires them – thatcompels them to dig deep to apply their reserves of creativity, cunning,compassion and courage. Fuller noted that most of the work people do is a drainon the Earth’s resources. All around the world, people are driving in cars tooffices, using computers, toner cartridges and polystyrene packages. All of thisis costly from the perspective of the planet’s ecology (apparently the words‘ecology’ and ‘economy’ have the same root).It would be much more economical and efficient, Fuller reasoned, to subsidizepeople so they could live in self-sufficient communities where they producedtheir own food and energy. He proposed giving everyone on Earth who didn’talready have a mission, a ‘research grant for life’, in whatever subjectinterested them. I love this idea.Oscar Wilde, who was also a brilliant social thinker, arrived at the sameconclusion over a half-century before Fuller. Instead of the current system,Wilde believed, we need some form of socialism, where people share property andreduce government to its most basic utilitarian functions. He thought thatattaining a liberated society required developing our machines so that theycould do all of the depressing and miserable labour – the drudgery – freeingpeople to develop their unique individuality. Wilde saw ‘cultivated leisure’,not work, as the ultimate purpose of human existence.I find it significant that the field of robotics is developing quickly, reachingthe point where machines can in fact do all of the horrible, dehumanizing tasks.Depending on what kind of society we construct for ourselves, we could liberateourselves from meaningless labour, within the next half-century. For this tohappen, we need a new vision of human purpose and possibility.Buckminster Fuller made one error: he believed that the design revolution couldhappen without a major transformation in the political arena, forgetting thatsocial systems are also artefacts of human design. As Arendt recognized, Westernthinkers have tended to ignore our political and social system, which hasdeveloped through trial and error, experiment, failure and innovation. Also, itseems obvious that the only way we can address these areas is by changing theunderlying beliefs, values and ideology that make up the consciousness of thecollective.In this book, we are exploring three areas: the technical infrastructure, whichincludes agriculture, energy, industry and so on; the social orpolitical-economic system; and consciousness – the beliefs, values and ideologythat are reinforced and reiterated through media, laws and education. Thesethree main areas all work together, like three wheels with intermeshed gearsthat turn each other. When our technology changes, for instance, it opens newpossibilities, which can change the social system as well as the collectiveconsciousness.As an example, we can look at the evolution in media technology, which hasprofoundly reshaped society over time. There would never have been far-flungempires like Rome’s without a written code of laws, which could be disseminatedacross its territories, homogenizing how people behaved. The modernnation-state, our current form of liberal democracy, would have been impossiblewithout the printing press, which allowed people to stay updated with regularnews, so they could participate in elections as informed citizens. Followingthis logic, the interactive media we have developed over the last decades shouldalso lead to a profound social transformation, beyond what we have already seen.Karl Marx developed a model of how the technical, social and ideological areassupported each other as part of a whole system. He named them base, structureand super-structure. Marx also realized that the eighteenth-century revolutionshad been incomplete, because they supported a false mode of individuality,protecting each person’s rights (including the right to property) against thoseof other people.The revolutions of the eighteenth century degraded ‘the sphere in which manconducts himself as a communal being’. They enshrined ‘the freedom of egoisticman . . . Man was therefore not freed from religion; he received religiousfreedom. He was not freed from property. He received freedom of property. He wasnot freed from the egoism of trade, but received freedom to trade.’ Therevolutions therefore led to the commercial society we have today, where peopleprotect their interests against each other.‘Workers unite: you have nothing to lose but your chains,’ Marx and hiscollaborator Friedrich Engels wrote in The Communist Manifesto. They wanted aworldwide revolution to liberate the proletariat – the urban workers, theindustrial underclass – which they romanticized as the true subject of history.Their goal was to establish a stateless, classless society without privilege,private property or hierarchy, where the workers would own the means ofproduction, and all aspects of social life would be centrally controlled.Marx and his followers believed a worker-owned society would mean liberationfrom domination and servitude – it would be the end of history. In practice, itdidn’t work out that way. Communist revolutions led to totalitarian regimes anddictatorships. Communism became a disgraced philosophy in the West.To give Marx credit, he believed the communist revolution could only succeed ifit started in a highly developed, fully industrialized society. Once a countrylike the US or UK developed a successful model, he believed, it would spreadacross the world. Instead, communism took root in underdeveloped countries likeChina and Russia, where ironically it accelerated a brutal transition fromagrarian neo-feudalism to modern industrial societies. In the future, humanitymay still choose to build a global civilization essentially without classes,states or private property – even if the system that results has a differentname or no name at all.The Venus ProjectThe Venus Project, developed by the millenarian Jacque Fresco, promotes ahigh-tech upgrade of communism. Fresco and his collaborators foresee a ‘utopian’future based on a ‘resource economy’ without money or political parties. Whatthe Venus Project envisions is not a democracy or communism or socialism – it isa world run by super-computers. Technology would be applied rationally, tocreate a world without social divisions, where goods would be mathematicallydistributed as needed. The Venus Project looks towards complete automation andcomputerization to liberate humanity from all forms of drudgery. Popularized bythe Zeitgeist Movement, an outgrowth of Peter Joseph’s Zeitgeist documentaries,which became Internet sensations, the Venus Project gained many adherents. Whileit offers an accessible utopian programme in which shared abundance isguaranteed to all, it envisions this happening through a totalitarian systemthat sounds nightmarish.The Venus Project envisions futuristic cities, geometrically symmetrical,floating on the oceans, with a bit of Flash Gordon flair. ‘Over time, automatedmachines would intelligently manage the earth’s resources and ultimately freehumanity of all unnecessary laborious tasks,’ one proponent writes. ‘All of theworld’s resources would be held as common heritage, and all people would haveunhindered access to any resource, good, or product available, without the useof money, credit, barter, or any form of debt or servitude.’In my head, I contrast my imaginary vision for our future with other models Iencounter. The Venus Project comes close in some ways – Jacque Fresco and hiscollaborators envision an entirely equitable world, without need of money, wherewe have mastered technology to support ecological health – but I find the modelthey propose offputting and dehumanizing, even though the Venus Projectdefinitely owes a great deal to Buckminster Fuller’s work. But their combinationof design science with ideals of purity seem too similar to communism. And Ithink a world run by computers would be a boring, sterile and unhappy one. If weare realistically going to undertake a redesign of our social operating systemto create a functional utopia, we don’t want a world without eccentricity ornonviolent conflict.The Venus Project rejects any kind of religion, mysticism or spirituality asantiquated and atavistic. Without an understanding of the psychic aspects ofreality, its vision seems flat. It is unclear what people are meant to do inthat sterile future state, once they have become appendages of a flawlesslycomputerized hive mind. The whole thing feels more dystopian than utopian to me.Without the prospect of a psycho-technic evolution, where people apply the toolsof art, science and shamanism to explore the inner dimensions of consciousness,honing their telepathic abilities and psychic powers, I don’t see the point.According to the Venus Project, there will be no politics of any sort in thefuture. Super-computers will decide humanity’s fate. Marx had the same idea,believing a communist victory would create a world without politics or struggle.I disagree with Fresco’s team and agree instead with Hannah Arendt thatpolitical expression is part of our human essence. Politics doesn’t have to be acorrupt puppet show. In an authentic society, the activity of politics – debate,discussion, decisionmaking – would be part of the fun. We would engage with itas something beautiful and true, an expressive form that combines art andethics. We don’t want to surrender our political agency – not to the‘dictatorship of the proletariat’, and certainly not to a super-computer orsilicon AI.Permanent RevolutionFor a number of reasons – perhaps because it was far more extreme and thereforemore glamorous – the French Revolution tends to get studied, and celebrated,much more than the American Revolution. As Arendt saw it, the French Revolutionwas, in the end, a failure. It led to mass guillotining, the rise to power of adespot, and the Napoleonic Wars.In fact, the French have kept trying to have another revolution to make up forthe mess of the first one. Every few years, it seems, there are mass riots andoccupations across the country. As I write this, another rebellion, Nuit debout,is under way, with actions in over 30 cities across France. Just as the originalrevolutionaries renamed the months – Messidor, Thermidor, and so on – today’srebels are following a new calendar, seeking to overthrow capitalism’s temporalorder.The American Revolution – however imperfect – established successful, enduringinstitutions. But from my perspective, the failures of the American Revolutionare as glaring as its achievements. The new government not only perpetuatedslavery, denigrating Africans to subhuman status, it treated the native peopleon the continent as nonhumans, who could be removed or killed withoutcompunction.At the same time, for the white settlers, the new system of governmentrepresented progress over the system of monarchy it replaced. The people weregiven some voice in their government, through the right to vote, and otherrights were protected. Before the Enlightenment and the revolutions of theeighteenth century, the idea that ‘All men are created equal’ did not exist.This idea certainly represented progress, even though, in practice – from theearly years until today – there continue to be two systems of justice, one forthe rich and a quite different one for the poor.Arendt explored the paradoxes inherent in the American Revolution – or anyrevolution, once it succeeds: ‘The end of rebellion is liberation, while the endof revolution is the foundation of freedom.’ To give a stable foundation tofreedom requires institutions, rules and legal codes – and these, ironically,often limit people’s freedom, in different ways. The Founding Fathers discoveredan intoxicating joy in designing the new social system that their descendantswould follow. They realized, however, that this delightful ‘public freedom’ theyhad found would not be passed down to future generations, who would be forced tofollow the rules they made.Late in his life, Thomas Jefferson realized that it had been a mistake, a designflaw, to end the revolution – to establish, in other words, permanent and fixedinstitutions. An ongoing insurrection would have been preferable. During therevolution, local townships had tremendous autonomy – Jefferson called them‘elementary republics’. But this autonomy was taken from them once the federalgovernment was established. He realized, too late, that he actually wanted asystem where everybody is ‘a participator in the government of affairs, notmerely at an election one day a year, but every day; where there shall not be aman in the State who will not be a member of some one of its councils, great orsmall, he will let the heart be torn out of his body sooner than his power bewrested from him by a Caesar or a Bonaparte’.Arendt discovered that, between the fall of an old regime and the rise of a newstate, something new was always seeking to be born. This self-organizing hadgone on time after time, as soon as government disintegrated. Worker’sassemblies and neighbourhood councils had been, as Jonathan Schell also pointsout, ‘the embryos of what might become an entirely new form of government whoselifeblood would be the kind of continuous, active participation in politicsexhibited in the revolutions’.The continuous revolution Jefferson wanted would have liberated each person tothe highest degree, requiring their active participation. It would have beenbased on ‘elementary republics’ that were autonomous, regenerative andself-determining. It is similar to the kind of anarchism that Kropotkin andothers imagined as ‘an everchanging and fugitive equilibrium between a multitudeof varied forces and influences’.Postmodern society thwarts our innate desire to participate politically. Justvoting in an election every few years, marching once in a while, or signingpetitions on Avaaz or MoveOn doesn’t count for much. We need new avenues forpassionate participation – not just in elections every few years, butcontinuously. The desire for this is so effectively masked and covered up thatmost people don’t even feel it as something they have forfeited.Today’s communications infrastructure could support a permanent revolution. Infact, I think this would be its logical endpoint. It seems possible – let’s trya thought experiment – to design and launch a social networking infrastructure,via the Internet, that seamlessly supports political collaboration, directdemocracy and resource sharing, based on transparent exchanges. Along withlaunching such a global platform, we would need to undertake a mass educationalinitiative through the media. We would have to disseminate the values andprinciples of a cooperative, trust-based society to people across the world.As media critic Clay Shirky writes in Here Comes Everybody,Our social tools are not an improvement to modern society; they are a challengeto it. New technology makes new things possible: but put another way, when newtechnology appears, previously impossible things start occurring. If enough ofthose impossible things are important and happen in a bundle, quickly, thechange becomes a revolution.We have already seen the power of our new social tools to raise awareness andcoordinate social action in movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy, Black LivesMatter and WikiLeaks. This could be just the beginning. Over the next years, wehave the potential to use the Internet to design, as a new global template, aparticipatory infrastructure for direct democracy that remains transparent andflexible, without hardening into a new institutional monstrosity. Manyinitiatives point in this direction.Manufactured MindIn Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire, Antonio Negri and MichaelHardt explore how a global revolution might become a universal phenomenon – andhappen quickly. Negri, a political philosopher, was jailed by the Italiangovernment in the 1980s, accused of supporting the Red Brigades, a leftistterrorist organization. In fact, it seems the government was just trying tosilence him. Hardt is a professor of political science at Duke University. Thetwo thinkers wrote a series of books together, balancing poetic flights ofContinental theory with Anglo-Saxon pragmatism. The focus of their work is ourpotential for global revolution, based on their analysis of the forms of powerand the productive forces inherent in post-industrial society. Negri and Hardtsee new opportunities in the waves of social changes that have taken place inthe last half-century and continue today.During the Industrial Age, the focus was on the production of material goods. Ina post-industrial world, the most important, or ‘hegemonic’, form of productionis no longer physical objects. Today, above all in the developed world, themajority of work is in the realm of ‘immaterial production’. This includes themaking of ideas, memes, narratives, images, financial instruments and socialtechnologies that shape how people form commercial or personal relationships.This is a significant change. Today, the biggest taxi company in the world,Uber, owns no cars. The biggest company for accommodation, Airbnb, owns nohotels. These companies – and others like them – seek monopoly control over thenetworks which define and mediate commercial relationships.What immaterial production produces, most of all, is consciousness itself. Negricalls it, ‘the production of subjectivity’. Our mass media and communicationstools continuously produce, and reproduce, a certain level or frequency ofconsciousness with particular patterns of thought and action. For instance,people’s consumer habits and values are subconsciously shaped by advertising.Corporations don’t only respond to the desires of the masses; they usepsychological techniques to create what Herbert Marcuse called ‘false needs’ –new desires for high-status or ‘positional’ goods. Mass consciousness –subjectivity – is manufactured, mass-produced, by the corporate media andadvertising industry.Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud and the founder of the moderndiscipline of public relations, put it plainly: ‘The conscious and intelligentmanipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an importantelement in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism ofsociety constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of ourcountry.’ Bernays applied techniques of social psychology to reach into thesubconscious of the public and change their behaviour. He famously organized‘freedom parades’ in the 1920s, where glamorous young flappers would smokecigarettes, inspiring other women to pick up the habit. These techniques havebeen refined in the decades since.How people should relate to authority, what kinds of relationships they considerappropriate, what they should buy, and many other cues are given to them throughadvertisements, television shows and film. The primary function of media, as Iunderstand it, is not to entertain or educate, but to coordinate behaviour on amass scale, syncopating modern society around patterns of consumption, work andleisure. The positive side of this is that it suggests how a new form ofsubjectivity, a new level of consciousness, could be transmitted and imprintedquickly, if the mass media expressed a different intention.Although the idea that ‘subjectivity’ is mass-produced may seem strange atfirst, I think it is crucial that we realize this. We tend to believe that oursubjectivity – our consciousness and worldview – is a personal and privatematter. Most people don’t realize that the internal landscape of their thoughtsand feelings has been constructed for them, produced by an extremely powerfuland supple corporate-industrial entertainment system. This system has beenbrilliant at integrating rebellion and dissent, absorbing and nullifying it. Itend to think, in fact, that the battle for our future will be conducted throughthe media, which mass-manufactures and programmes human subjectivity. Peoplehave been programmed – but they can also be deprogrammed, and this can happenquickly.The 1960s and its aftermath provide a useful case study. Back then, a politicalcounterculture seemed to pose a threat to the dominant power structure. WhatNegri and Hardt call empire fought this menace in two different ways: the policeand security services ferociously clamped down on the radical political aspectsof the counterculture. Many leaders of the black liberation movement in the US –Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Fred Hampton – were assassinated. White movementleaders were also put in prison, often on trumped-up drug charges. Nonviolentanti-war protestors at Kent State were shot and killed, sending a clear signalthat dissent, past a certain point, would not be tolerated.At the same time, the cultural ambience of rebellion was assimilated seamlesslyinto the machinery of immaterial production, feeding the consumerist system thatthe countercultural pioneers sought to resist and undermine. Rebellion – being‘cool’ – was cut off from politics, ecological or social issues. It becamemerely a stance or a pose, used to sell products like cigarettes, alcohol andmotorcycles.Marx and Engels believed that factory workers – the proletariat – would be theclass to launch global revolution and overcome oppression. This didn’t happen asthey predicted. Negri and Hardt seek to update this idea by defining a newrevolutionary subject of history, which they call multitude. Since we are now inthe Information Age, the multitude are ‘immaterial workers who become a new kindof combatant, cosmopolitan bricoleurs of resistance and cooperation. They arethe ones who can throw the surplus of their knowledges and skills into theconstruction of a common struggle against imperial power.’ The softwaredesigner, the media maker, the hacker become foot soldiers in Negri and Hardt’srevolution – neo-romantic, postmodern superheroes.According to Multitude, revolutions follow a pattern of ‘resistance, exodus, theemptying out of the enemy’s power, and the multitude’s construction of a newsociety’. In the past, this sequence took many years or even decades to unfold.But because our new social tools allow for instantaneous global communicationand coordination, Negri and Hardt believe that ‘insurrectional activity is nolonger divided into such stages but develops simultaneously’. I find this acrucial insight – an amazing and also a hopeful prospect.In the past, when news travelled slower than it does today, insurrections andrevolutions were generally local affairs, confined to a single region or nation.Because humanity is now linked together through instantaneous networks ofelectronic communications, new social movements can spread rapidly, in anonlinear way. They can become global phenomena, suddenly, without prelude orbuild-up. When it succeeds, a local initiative, a new idea, can be distributedeverywhere, all at once, as we saw with the sudden global emergence of theOccupy movement or, on a technological level, the rapid spread of smart phones.It is therefore possible to conceive of how a global ‘revolution’ – a new set ofvalues, beliefs and behaviours, transforming our relationship to Earth – couldbecome accessible, on a planetary scale. The ecological mega-crisis could be thelever that causes this sudden shift. Our immediate mission, then, is to be readywith working, peaceful, sustainable alternatives that can be scaled up when thetime is right."},{"pageContent":"PART FIVEPOST-CAPITALISM:PROPERTY, MONEYAND POWERimages [images/9781780289724_img02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"11POSSESSION TRANCEI’ve dealt with the big picture stuff, the overarching mythological frameworksthat I believe to be the most helpful at this time of crisis. In what follows, Iwill explore the more material, everyday aspects of the current structures thatwe live in that no longer work for us, or that actively obstruct our progress:areas such as power, property and money. All of these areas represent socialrelationships, collective agreements, that become so ingrained in our approachto the world that we take them entirely for granted. We reject any alternativeview of the world that doesn’t seem possible, given the existing structures. Weforget that these structures are, in the end, mental constructs. They can, infact, change. If we are going to transition from our current predicament to apost-capitalist world, we will need to make new agreements.It was 1985, a long-distant autumn day, when, as a sophomore at WesleyanUniversity in Middletown, Connecticut, I chewed a bunch of dried mushroom stemsfor the first time. During that first trip, I saw the entire concrete, steel andglass edifice of postmodern civilization as an artifice, a pompous fraud. We hadimposed an abstract order over nature. By comparison, every tree, shrub and rockradiated patience, humility and good-humoured wisdom.By briefly detaching my awareness from my ego, the mushrooms showed me that welive in a society based on layers of collective delusion. I saw how our systemconstantly tries to convince us of its importance and permanence – to intimidateus – while it suppresses those subjects that are most worthy of our interest,such as the nature of our own consciousness. The people around me seemed absent,hypnotized, watching baseball on television or reading reports on the stockmarket. I still recall going into a local deli and feeling embarrassed – ashamed– that the crumpled dollars I pulled from my wallet were what our culture valuedhighly. I felt that a joke had been played on humanity.That semester I also read Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origins ofInequality for the first time. Much like that first mushroom journey, that essayleft an imprint, staying with me for my whole life. Like a fistful ofpsilocybin, Rousseau’s thoughts peeled away at my understanding of the world, toreveal a wider viewpoint.In his Discourse, Rousseau sought to understand ‘the different accidents whichmay have improved the human understanding while depraving the species, and mademan wicked while making him sociable’. He looked for ‘the moment at which righttook the place of violence and nature became subject to law, and to explain bywhat sequence of miracles the strong came to serve the weak, and the people topurchase imaginary repose at the expense of real felicity’.Rousseau believed the origin of civilization was private property. ‘The firstman who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying “This ismine”, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder ofcivil society.’ Inequality didn’t exist for man in what Rousseau called ‘thestate of nature’ – in nomadic, aboriginal societies.Rousseau believed this innovation led, eventually, to a state of collectivesuffering. In a society based on property rights, people find their positionsinsecure. They are forced to compete against each other – undermine and attackeach other – to gain or protect their wealth. ‘It has indeed cost us not alittle trouble to make ourselves as wretched as we are,’ he wrote. While thosewho hold wealth become vain and self-important, those without it often feeldepressed and marginalized.The Problem with PropertyIf we think about it, we can see that private property – a mental construct weprotect by laws and police forces – has made our world an unfree world. Apigeon, a rat, a squirrel, has far more freedom of movement than a human being,who confronts fences and walls in most directions he might like to go. Thesefences and walls also live within us. We internalize them. It is possible thatour world will always remain unjust and unfree until we end the system thatprotects private ownership, above all other rights. As unlikely as it is toimagine, this could be done humanely and benevolently. Eventually, we willsupersede property rights through new cooperative arrangements.Three of my favourite social thinkers – Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde and BuckminsterFuller – agree with Rousseau that private property is at the root of oursociety’s sickness. For Marx, one problem was that property contorted the humanpersonality, making us ‘stupid and one-sided’. We confused the abstract ‘senseof having’ with a real sense. We got lost in this abstraction.Marx wrote, ‘In the place of all physical and mental senses there has thereforecome the sheer estrangement of all these senses, the sense of having.’ Ifhumanity abolished private property and collectivized resources, Marx reasoned,people would be free to live in the present again. They would open their sensesto the world around them.Like Marx, Oscar Wilde saw that private property damaged human psychology bysubstituting a removed, abstract relationship to the world for immersion in thepresent: ‘By confusing a man with what he possesses, it has led Individualismentirely astray. It has made gain not growth its aim. So that man thought thatthe important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is tobe. The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is.’All the world’s mystical traditions tell us that we cannot truly own or possessanything – everything in the universe is energy undergoing processes oftransformation. Chief Seattle said, ‘How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmthof the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of theair and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them?’ Ownership supports thelow-frequency delusions of the ego that wants to control, possess, dominate theworld. We turned the sense of having into something concrete, forgetting this isjust an illusion of our minds.Wilde similarly believed a new socialist arrangement was necessary.Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting privateproperty into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, willrestore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, andinsure the material well-being of each member of the community. It will, infact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment.Wilde did not see a contradiction between art and individuality – which heprized as the highest ideal – and a socialist or post-capitalist civilization.He thought socialism would allow the people’s individuality to flourish for thefirst time. He noted that ownership of property ‘has so many duties that itspossession to any large extent is a bore. It involves endless claims upon one,endless attention to business, endless bother. If property had simply pleasures,we could stand it; but its duties make it unbearable. In the interest of therich we must get rid of it.’I think we need at least to consider the possibility that we can never have atruly regenerative society as long as the basis of it is private property andhoarded capital. I find obvious reasons this is the case. First of all, property(and the rents or interest collected from it) divides the world into two classesof people: Haves and Have Nots.When somebody becomes wealthy, a Have, a huge amount of their intellect andenergy gets channelled into protecting the wealth they have gained, rather thanworking for the comprehensive good of all. Perhaps they originally wanted tocreate things that helped and improved the human condition. With personalsuccess, however, their focus inexorably shifts to protecting their own assetsand their family’s interests against everyone else.Those without property, the Have Nots, feel little incentive to fight for thefuture of the Earth, because the world is already cut off from them. It is owned– lock, stock and barrel – by the wealthy. They don’t feel the state of theEarth is their problem or responsibility. It is significant that indigenouspeople around the world have been courageously leading the battle against theextractive industries. Of course, this is partially because their homelands aredirectly threatened, but it is also because they come from cultures whereprivate property either didn’t exist or had limited value as a construct.In today’s ‘Brave New 1984’, a gigantic surveillance and security apparatushangs over us like an invisible spider web. Its main purpose is to protectproperty rights, both physical and intellectual forms of property. ‘When privateproperty is abolished there will be no necessity for crime, no demand for it; itwill cease to exist,’ Wilde wrote. The enormous waste generated by thecapitalist system is caused, at the root, by the individual’s thirst to attainpersonal wealth – the only way to be secure in such a system.Like Wilde, Fuller thought that private property would become a thing of thepast once humanity liberated its creative powers through a design revolution.Already in the 1960s, he noted, ‘Possession is becoming progressively burdensomeand wasteful and therefore obsolete.’Masses of people, particularly younger people, are starting to realize this now.We see a major cultural trend away from ownership towards a new sharing economy.Even the New York Times has noted, ‘Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is tothe 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine.’ This trend could be thestart of a large-scale metamorphosis. Ideally, in the future, people will ownlittle – or absolutely nothing – yet live abundantly, joyfully, able to accesswhatever they need or desire, when they need it. As virtual tools proliferate,property matters less to us than intangible assets, such as time and attention.In The Ecology of Freedom, Murray Bookchin declared that we need to end the‘private ownership of the planet by elite strata’ if we want to survive. As analternative, we must establish ‘a fully participatory society literally free ofprivilege and domination’. Bookchin expressed suspicion of partial ‘solutions tothe ecological crisis, like green consumerism, renewable energy, or carbontaxation’. He believed these reformist initiatives only concealed thedeep-seated nature of the crisis, and ‘thereby deflect public attention andtheoretical insight from an adequate understanding of the depth and scope of thenecessary change’. I think Bookchin makes a valid point – although one that willbe difficult for many people to accept. The fundamental basis of capitalism –private ownership of physical and intellectual property – may be ecologicallyunsound.What Do We Do?I realize that the idea that we can voluntarily engineer a transition to asociety where private property is either eliminated entirely or reduced to aminimum seems far-fetched. However, as Wilde noted, the progress of humanity isbased on the progressive realization of utopias. Human nature is not fixed, butchanges constantly. We first must realize – as Wilde and Marx did – that ourcivilization made a mistake in prioritizing having over being. We don’t yet knowwhat might happen to us once we correct that error.Wilde proposed a transition to a system in which humanity was liberated fromdrudgery through automation and freed from the burden of property by socialism.He admitted he was offering an idealistic, utopian programme – but he did notthink it was unattainable, even so.It is unpractical, and it goes against human nature. This is why it is worthcarrying out, and that is why one proposes it. For what is a practical scheme? Apractical scheme is either a scheme that is already in existence, or a schemethat could be carried out under existing conditions. But it is exactly theexisting conditions that one objects to; and any scheme that could accept theseconditions is wrong and foolish. The conditions will be done away with, andhuman nature will change.Some radicals still believe that the only way we can have an authentic socialtransformation is through mass uprising and violence. They note that millions ofpeople remain subject to violence, incarcerated in prisons for drug use, and soon. We live in a world dominated and controlled by military force. While this istrue, I don’t think violent revolt is possible in our current circumstances. Thepreponderance of military force, surveillance systems, killer drones, biologicalweapons and other insidious things makes an overthrow of developed worldgovernments pretty much unthinkable. The consequences would be horrific. I alsoagree with the Gandhi-esque principle that violence can only beget moreviolence.The alternative, then, is to engineer a peaceful transition of globalcivilization, superseding the current system of private property and hoardedcapital by developing new infrastructures that convert property intocooperatively owned resources or trusts, over time. In order to accomplish this,we would need to establish a global network of early adaptors who have committedto making a transition into a system of open cooperativism and peer-to-peerproduction. If cooperation and symbiosis are evolutionary advances overcompetition and domination, then such a system should outperform the old model.Within a few decades or at most a few generations, it should be possible toengineer a global conversion – a planetary reboot of our social operatingsystem.Stewardship and UsufructWhen I try to envision how we might eventually abolish private property, Iforesee a new model based on stewardship instead of ownership. Rather thanbringing about an abrupt and disruptive change, people could transfer theirproperty over time. There are already many examples of land trusts andworker-owned cooperatives that provide models for this. One possibility is torevive the medieval concept of usufruct. Usufruct means people have the right tocontinue to use a property or a tool productively, as long as they do not damageit, and particularly if they add value to it.This is how people in many traditional societies still live today. For instance,in Ladakh, a Tibetan Buddhist enclave in India, many families farm the same plotof land for generations. They build their houses without title or legal claim.Another contemporary example is an urban community garden, where citizenscooperate to enhance the beauty of a plot of land or vacant lot, without anyonegaining economic advantage from their efforts.I don’t reject the possibility that we might transition to a regenerativesociety while perpetuating some forms of private wealth and ownership. Perhapswe can. No doubt we would require, at the least, a redistribution of wealth tocreate a much fairer and more equitable world. Wealth redistribution throughtaxation can happen during declared emergencies like wars – there’s no reason wecan’t do it as we face global ecological meltdown.People today assume private property is good and natural. We think it motivatesfree enterprise and drives innovation. In any event, we believe it is a fixedand irreversible aspect of our lives. Examples of collectivized property fromMarxist countries like the Soviet Union, where the state owned the land and thefactories, have no appeal (although there were some benefits to this systemwhich have gone under-appreciated). But state ownership of land and factories isnot what we should seek. Our goal should be to develop a programme which, overtime, dissolves the concept of ownership entirely.People would need to know their basic needs are fulfilled. Guaranteed a basicincome, they would not have to prove their worthiness, or work to survive.Rooted in a shared sense of security and social trust, freed from the anxiety ofmarket fluctuations, they would then participate in models based on stewardshipand usufruct.I think we need seriously to consider how we can make a peaceful transition to apropertyless society. An open-source, peer-to-peer network designed tofacilitate cooperation, democratic decision-making and conservation couldspread, much as Google and Facebook did over the last decade. Such a socialinfrastructure could take over many functions now managed by governments. Whenhumanity becomes more comfortable with sharing rather than ownership as a model,we will convert private assets to commonly held resources. This might takedecades or even generations – but we first have to recognize it as our goal.A peer-to-peer network can make surplus or unused resources – a room, a piece ofland, a second car – available to those who need them. As now happens on siteslike Couchsurfing, eBay and Airbnb, people would have a rating based on pastexchanges. Social trust then becomes a new essential currency, on all levels.People will be able to use collectively held resources, as long as they agree toabide by a set of principles, which would include caring for the land andbuildings, and sharing with others. When multitudes of people find it to theirpersonal advantage to pool their resources voluntarily in a cooperative network,the movement towards a post-ownership society will be under way."},{"pageContent":"12THE MONEY PROBLEMThe force that transforms human nature is, ultimately, our desire to findmeaning and order in the world. As an idealist, I believe no possibility –however far-fetched it sounds, at first – is truly out of reach. It is aquestion of what we choose to pursue together – how we define our purpose andwhat we consider meaningful. Most of us will agree that our current system –based on property, privilege, the brutal exploitation of people and nature – isnot the best we can do. Apart from leading to ecological ruin, it doesn’t makeus truly happy. It induces anxiety, stress and fear, and it creates an insecureand unfree world.The contrast is obvious if you visit a place where people still live intraditional ways, in intact communities. One finds a baseline level of happinessfar above that of the middle class or the wealthy of the developed world. Peopledon’t have that disappointed, jaded, suspicious look in their eyes. They don’tinnately expect to be ripped off or shafted.My question, again, is how do we transition to a regenerative society in thetime available? There is no doubt that this requires a far more equitablesharing of the world’s wealth and resources. There are two ways this can happen:either through social convulsions, or through the construction of a viablealternative supported by some subset of the elite and the privileged – the 1 percent. We know we need to reduce excess consumption, redesign industry and shiftback to organic agriculture. All of this is necessary – but it is utterlyimpossible within the current economic system. Why is that the case?What’s Wrong with Money?People think of money as a natural phenomenon, similar to air or fire or water.Actually, money is an instrument that was designed by human beings to accomplishcertain goals.The modern form of a debt-based currency, issued by central banks, which areactually private institutions, and decoupled from any tangible resources, is arecent development that has accelerated the global dominance of financecapitalism. The inherent tendency of this system is to convert every naturalresource into a profit source and constantly expand markets by privatizingaspects of the commons. Today, the small privileged financial class who controlhow money is issued literally control the world.Since the 1970s, the financial sector has undergone a rapid, cancerous growth.We now live in a hyper-leveraged, deeply indebted ‘financialized’ society ruledby banks. In 2008, the global economy collapsed when we found that ‘subprimemortgages’, packaged into securities, were the basis of a massive Ponzi scheme.The beneficiaries of this scheme were the financial elite, and the losers wereeverybody else – the middle-class and working-class people who actually producevalue for society.When you think about it logically, it is obvious that those who profitexcessively through the financial services industry are parasites. They don’tcreate wealth. They extract it from the productive classes. The year after threemillion people lost their homes, Wall Street handed out $36 billion of bonuses.Through the alchemy of the financial system, the loss of assets of those threemillion people got transmuted into those bonuses. Virtually none of the bankerswho created this fiasco were punished – quite the opposite. Today’s monetarysystem is like a source code that has been thoroughly corrupted.After the subprime meltdown, the governments and central banks worked togetherto prop up the existing system. They decided to protect the ‘too big to fail’financial institutions. Rather than fixing the flaws or returning funds to thepoor and the shafted, they rewarded the perpetrators. They created vast sums ofmoney and gave them to the corrupt banks and securities firms, to ensure theircontinuity.In the months after the 2008 collapse, the Federal Reserve bought $1.75 trillionin bonds, including US Treasury Bonds and mortgagebacked securities, and engagedin successive rounds of ‘Quantitative Easing’. In September 2008, with therecovery still weak, the Fed started to buy $85 billion worth of bonds permonth, and continued to do so for a number of years. They bought $600 billionworth of bonds in 2010 alone. The amount of US debt is currently $13 trillion,and still growing.People will eventually realize our economic system failed – kicked the bucket –back in 2008. Since then, it has continued as a kind of virtual simulation ofitself, a ghost, based on ever-growing debts that everyone knows will never berepaid. Around the world, global debt is increasing at 7 per cent per year,while global gross domestic product lags behind at 2 per cent. Debt forcesunsustainable development. The system has only perpetuated itself byartificially inflating the monetary supply.Masters of the UniverseWhoever controls the money system and the money supply controls the world. InJanuary 2012, Kevin Roose, a reporter for the New York Times, managed to sneakinto an annual dinner of a Wall Street secret society called Kappa Beta Phi,held at the St Regis Hotel. The 250-person party featured a ‘Who’s Who’ of WallStreet plutocrats, including the CEOs of Citigroup and the Blackstone Group.In a series of skits and comedy routines, the financial bigwigs mocked the pooras well as liberals, lampooning the system which rewards them. They changed thelyrics of ‘I Believe’ from The Book of Mormon, singing, ‘I believe that God hasa plan for all of us. I believe my plan involves a seven-figure bonus.’ ABBA’s‘Dancing Queen’ became ‘Bailout King’.Roose was astonished. ‘Here, after all, was a group that included many of theexecutives whose firms had collectively wrecked the global economy in 2008 and2009. And they were laughing off the entire disaster in private, as if it were along-forgotten lark.’A major problem we confront in engineering the necessary transformation of ourcurrent political-economic system is that the people who currently run the showtend to be greedy and self-serving. Postmodern capitalism fosterswinner-take-all competition and treats social and environmental costs asmeaningless externalities. It self-selects its leadership from sociopathiccharacter types. Given this system, those who seek to maximize self-interest inany circumstance, with no moral qualms or compunctions, naturally rise to thetop.I don’t believe that the political and financial ruling elite, whoseshort-sighted greed and hypocrisy corralled us into this disaster, will be ableto lead us out of it. Lawrence Summers was one of President Obama’s key economicadvisers and a former chief economist for the World Bank. Summers – himselfworth an estimated $40 million – is on the record as stating, ‘There are nolimits . . . to the carrying capacity of the earth that are likely to bind atany time in the foreseeable future . . . The idea that we should put limits ongrowth because of some natural limit is a profound error.’ Somehow or other, thefinancial elite who exercise such tremendous power and influence must bedisplaced. This can be done either by leaders like Bernie Sanders, who respondauthentically to the problems they have unleashed, or through a ‘leaderlessrevolution’ where the people govern themselves via direct democracy, or somehybrid of the two.John Fullerton, founder of the Capital Institute, resigned from JP Morgan in2001, after a 20-year career. Believing the banking industry had lost anyconnection with the values and principles of earlier times, he went on a searchto find answers to the underlying problems of the global financial system. Hediscovered that we were facing ‘profound, interlocking crises’, which includedthe reality that we are ‘destroying the ability of the planet to support life aswe know it’. The most startling discovery he made was that ‘the modern scheme ofeconomics and finance – what Wall Street “geniuses” (like me) practiced so well– formed the root cause of these systemic crises’.Fullerton believes our greatest challenge ‘is to address the root cause of oursystemic crises – today’s dominant (neoliberal) economic paradigm and thefinancial system that fuels it and rules it – by transitioning to a moreeffective form of capitalism that is regenerative and therefore sustainable overthe long term’. He considers this to be our economy’s ‘Copernican moment’,requiring the emergence of a new systemic and holistic worldview, embedded in aninterlocking set of social and financial institutions.Money Is a Design ProblemAccording to the Belgian financier Bernard Lietaer, one of the architects of theeuro, there are a few important design features of our money, which he calls‘our most pervasive information system’. Money is issued by a country, or, inthe case of the euro, a group of countries. It is issued by fiat – in otherwords, it is not linked to any tangible resource, whether gold or energy. It iscreated out of nothing. Because our money comes into existence as bank debt, itaccrues interest over time.When you get a loan from a bank, the bank doesn’t create that money physically.It credits your account for the amount, which you can then use to buy amortgage, or for some other purpose. While the bank issues you the initialamount of the loan, it does not create the extra amount you will need to return– in other words, the interest. You have to compete against everyone else insociety to bring back that excess. Money is ‘destroyed’ – it disappears – whenthe loan is repaid.The current financial system is designed to perpetuate artificial scarcity. Insuch a system, there will always be losers – in other words, bankruptcies. Therewill always be competition for money, which is artificially maintained as ascarce resource. Central banks control the global money supply by manipulatinginterest rates, among other means. Such a system is based on fear. It forcesexcessive, destructive growth.‘Conventional national currencies and monetary systems are programmed to producecompetition and remain scarce,’ Lietaer writes. Over time, interest has theeffect of concentrating wealth in fewer and fewer hands. We have seen anextraordinary increase in wealth inequality over the last decades. It isestimated that 50 plutocrats currently control more wealth than that of half ofthe planet’s 7.2 billion people. The poorest 80 per cent of the world’spopulation control less than 1.4 per cent of global wealth.Can we resolve the systemic problems – the ecological mega-crisis, theever-increasing wealth inequality – unleashed by our current system by reformingfinance capitalism, even drastically? Or do we need to transition to a differenteconomic system, consisting of new instruments for exchanging value, whichsupport social equality and ecological health?Reformist ApproachesAccording to scientists, we are up against hard limits in how much more CO2 wecan produce before our planet becomes unliveable. We have released an estimated1,900 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in the last two centuries. We haveraised global temperatures more than a degree. We can only release another 500billion tons of carbon dioxide, roughly, if we want to stay below the twodegrees Celsius limit considered necessary to avoid runaway climate change. Atcurrent rates of CO2 emissions, we will release that amount in the next 15years. This gives us very little time. It underlines the urgency of oursituation.Unfortunately, we now know that even two degrees above preindustrial levels istoo much. It will produce catastrophic feedback effects. It may make large-scalemethane eruption inevitable. Therefore, a massive, globally orchestratedrestriction of CO2 emissions must be combined with a comprehensive, globalscaling up of renewable energy as well as all practical techniques to removeexcess carbon from the atmosphere. This is what we must do – at least I can’tsee any alternative – if we decide we want to try to salvage our civilizationand protect the world’s children, including our own kids and their kids, alongwith the integrity of our biosphere. The change will have to happenexponentially, not incrementally.At present, the main proposal for dealing with CO2 while maintaining the currentcapitalist system is by taxing carbon pollution. Ways to do this include ‘capand trade’ schemes that establish markets for the right to pollute and emitgreenhouse gases, and ways to make companies pay for ‘ecosystem services’; aswell as systems of financial reward where money is given to companies andcountries for not polluting or for leaving CO2 sequestered in forests orunderground.‘Cap and trade’ seeks to regulate emissions by providing a profit incentive forcompanies to transition away from polluting. The market defines a certain numberof ‘allowances’ for pollution which can be auctioned off to companies. Thesecompanies can then trade or sell off these allowances, if they are unable toreduce their emissions fast enough. The number of allowances can be reducedannually, limiting the total amount of CO2 production, and forcing companies toinnovate and switch to non-polluting sources, over time.‘Cap and trade is itself an innovation in how we operate as a society’, RamezNaam optimistically writes. ‘It combines the best traits of the market – therapid rate of innovation and the ability to find ever more efficient ways to dothings – with the unique ability of government to set goals around things thatthe market is blind to, like damage to the environment. And it’s worked.’Naam points to the George Bush-led efforts to cap and trade sulphur dioxideemissions in the 1990s as a model. Between 1990 and 2000, sulphur dioxideemissions in the US declined by half, to under seven million tons.Unfortunately, sulphur emissions started rising globally again after 2000,largely due to China’s intensive use of coal as an energy source.That points to the deeper problem: as long as we maintain a global economicsystem that forces rapid growth, we will be unable to address the biosphericcrisis at its root. We will keep shuffling deckchairs on the Titanic. Left-wingcritics argue that creating new markets for CO2 within the existing financialsystem will not help. The growth imperative underlying our system will simplylead to new forms of harm.The Indian activist Vandana Shiva makes a compelling argument against carbontrading and similar markets. ‘Creating a market in pollution is ethicallyperverse,’ Shiva writes in Soil Not Oil. ‘Some things should not be tradable –water and biodiversity are too valuable to be reduced to marketable commodities.Other things, like toxic waste and greenhouse gases, should not be generated. Toturn them into tradable commodities ensures that they will continue to beproduced.’ On the other hand, if we can design a system that protects naturalassets using market mechanisms, it would be far preferable to not doing so.Carbon taxation is another strategy. ‘The key to building a global economy thatcan sustain economic progress is the creation of an honest market, one thattells the ecological truth,’ writes Worldwatch founder Lester Brown. ‘To createan honest market, we need to restructure the tax system by reducing taxes onwork and raising them on various environmentally destructive activities toincorporate indirect costs into the market price.’Theoretically, if new taxes aggressively penalized CO2 emissions, as well asother forms of pollution and environmental degradation, this would have theeffect of transforming the capitalist system. It would force corporationsradically to change their practices, embracing renewable sources of energy andregenerative processes on all levels. The likelihood of establishing such anaggressive tax policy, however, remains very remote, considering the power ofcorporations and their ability to evade or wriggle out of restrictions.The underlying problem is that truly addressing the hidden costs andexternalities involved in the current form of capitalist production will makethe things we use every day far more expensive. For instance, a smart phonemight cost $5,000 or more – which probably is closer to the actual value of itsmanufacture and materials. Prices have already been rising on many goods overthe last decades. Without a transition to a system that resembles socialism insome ways – that applies technical efficiency rationally to satisfy people’sbasic needs – we will see extreme privation and misery, preceding a deeperdoom-spiral.Brown proposes a carbon tax of $240 per ton by 2020. He notes that this may seemsteep, but it is still far less than petrol taxes in Europe. When he wrote the2008 version of his book Plan B, Britain’s petrol tax was £3 per gallon,equivalent to a carbon tax of £1,239 per ton. ‘The high gasoline taxes in Europehave contributed to an oil-efficient economy and to far greater investment inhigh-quality public transportation over the decades, making it less vulnerableto supply disruptions.’The market bases the valuation of the major energy corporations on the storedreserves of fossil fuel they plan to extract over the next decades, while theystill spend $90 million per day searching for hydrocarbons. These reserves alsoplay a major part in national planning. As much as $20 trillion of fossil fuelreserves must be recognized as stranded assets, because extracting them wouldlead to biospheric collapse. Those trillions of dollars of stranded assets arealso structural underpinnings of the global economy. This is a knotty problem.It may be impossible to resolve within the current system.It is possible, in the near term, that we will require a combination of statesocialism to manage the energy and banking centres, anarchism to allow formyriad experiments in political and economic systems, and capitalism. InPostcapitalism, Paul Mason argues we must nationalize the central banks as wellas the energy companies, in the short term. The state would take control of ‘theenergy distribution grid, plus all big carbon-based suppliers of energy’. Hepoints out that the energy corporations ‘are already toast, as the majority oftheir assets cannot be burned without destroying the planet’. Once made publicinstitutions, central banks could focus on ecological goals: ‘In addition to itsclassic functions – monetary policy and financial stability – a central bankshould have a sustainability target: all decisions would be modelled againsttheir climate, demographic and social impacts.’The options are either that we build a global people’s movement that forcesthese corporations to capitulate to the public will, or that we disband thesedestructive corporations, or that we find a way to compel them to change fromwithin. They could, in theory, redirect their immense store of capital – as wellas their capacity for technical innovation – to help engineer the globaltransition to renewable energy and conservation of threatened resources. One wayto stop these companies from extracting those resources would be to compensatethem financially for leaving them untouched. As painful as this idea is – likerewarding a tobacco company for not promoting smoking to teenagers – it ispreferable to planetary meltdown.No matter what tactic we choose, the only hope I can see is that we commit to anevolution of consciousness that must be intentionally engineered. We mustsomehow use the mass media and social media to provoke a mass awakening. Thehuman populace must willingly accept serious limitations – on wealth,consumption and travel – over the next decades. We must voluntarily enrolourselves in a worldwide effort to accelerate the systemic transition to aregenerative society based on renewable power, sharing, conservation of scarceresources, local farming and distributed manufacturing.I believe that if the mass media is used as a megaphone – if a chorus of publicartists and other public figures use their platforms in an organized way – thepeople of the world will agree that a period of shared sacrifice is preferableto the end of our species in a universal collapse of the Earth’s life supportsystems. However I consider it, I can’t see another option. The ecologicalmega-crisis is destined to unite humanity through either a universal collapse ora global awakening.Systemic ChangeBuckminster Fuller noted that ‘under lethal emergencies vast new magnitudes ofwealth come mysteriously into effective operation’. During the Second World War,for instance, the United States engineered a rapid shift of its industriestowards military production within a few short months.Now we need a mobilization, on a planetary scale, beyond what any human societyhas ever undertaken. We know the techniques and technologies that we need todeploy rapidly. We also know we must conserve our dwindling fossil fuel reservesand extract as little of the remaining hydrocarbon reserves as possible. We mustintentionally redesign our political-economic system to bring about thistransformation – and this is something that has never been attempted before.Our best approach would be to pursue both solutions – the reformist and theradical – simultaneously. By all means, let’s introduce a carbon tax as quicklyas possible, if we can, as well as cap-and-trade agreements that may help limitcarbon emissions in the short term and encourage investment in renewable energy.Let’s also put a price tag on ecosystems services, charging industries for theirconsumption of natural resources. But at the same time, let’s design and launchnew instruments for sharing and creating value that will hopefully supersede thecurrent system.Bernard Lietaer draws an essential distinction between ‘Yang’ (masculine,aggressive) and ‘Yin’ (feminine, receptive) currencies. Our modern form ofstandardized national currency is entirely Yang. It is designed to be scarce. Itforces incessant competition and hoarding.Reviewing the history of monetary systems, Lietaer finds many examples of Yincurrencies. These currencies are designed to increase social, rather thanfinancial capital. They do this by building cooperation. They are issued in sucha way as to discourage private accumulation or make it impossible. Currencieswith a negative interest, or ‘demurrage’ charge, were widely used in Egypt andin medieval Europe. These societies had such an extraordinary excess of socialwealth, despite their comparatively low level of technology, that they builtenduring monuments like the Pyramids and cathedrals.The simplest way to stop excess hoarding of a currency is to give it a negativeinterest rate, so it automatically declines in value over time. If you are usinga currency that loses value the longer you hold on to it, you will want to getit back into circulation as quickly as you can. If there is nothing productiveyou can do with it, you will share it with other people and organizations whoneed it, building up goodwill instead of storing profit.We have recent examples of negative-interest currencies used in Germany andAustria after the First World War, and in the United States during the GreatDepression. Currencies such as the Wara in Germany, the Wörgl in Austria, and anumber of ‘stamp scrips’ in the US depreciated in value. These alternativesrapidly reduced unemployment and supported the growth of local economies bykeeping money flowing within the community. The reason we don’t know about theseexperiments today is not because they failed but because they were surprisinglyeffective. The governing elites realized they threatened their central bank’scontrol over the monetary supply and quickly made them illegal. PresidentRoosevelt, for instance, prohibited these ‘emergency currencies’ in 1934, at theheight of the Great Depression.Lietaer proposes a negative-interest currency, the Terra, as a global standardfor making trades. The value of the Terra would be linked to a ‘basket’ ofcommodities sold on the stock market, and therefore would not float in anabstract void, like today’s currencies. The Terra would feature a ‘demurrage’charge, losing value over time. The way that money currently accrues interest –eternally – has no relationship to nature. In nature, things degrade, break androt over time. A negativeinterest currency like the Terra could bring humanactivity more in alignment with natural processes.A trading currency like the Terra could be combined with local currencyinitiatives, such as Time Banks and Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS). Thesecurrencies would be designed to keep value circulating within communities,instead of flowing to distant rentiers or corporations. Instead of only usingone type of currency – debt-based, issued by central banks – for everything, wewould have an ‘ecosystem’ of currencies used for different purposes,intentionally designed as an interdependent whole that supports ecologicallyrestorative activities.We can develop many different instruments for exchanging value. Local andcomplementary currencies can be designed to keep value circulating withincommunities instead of flowing out to corporations. ‘Local currencies work bestfor locally generated goods and services, or when a commodity’s markup isderived from a locally added value, such as atmosphere or labor,’ writes DougRushkoff in Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus. ‘Complementary currency’s purpose,more often than not, is either to kick-start a local economy or to make localtransactions less burdened by the cost of currency and thus more competitivewith non-local corporate, chain store, or big-box offerings.’ Rushkoff, likemany thinkers, believes we need to reprogramme ‘the operating system of money .. . from the ground up to be biased less toward preserving passive wealth forthe rich and more toward exchanging value among everyone else’.One simple way to measure value is through hours of work exchanged. This is howTime Banks operate. On the time-banking platform TimeRepublik, for instance,people can offer skills to each other on an hour-per-hour basis. A carpentermight come to your house to fix your shelves. You pay them with hours you haveaccrued, and they then use those hours to get a babysitter. A Time Bank systemcan be a useful complement to other forms of currency. A time-dollar networkmakes great sense in areas where traditional employment is scarce. Cities inItaly and Spain are currently working with TimeRepublik to encourage skillsharing locally.In a LETS, local businesses, service providers and manufacturers come togetherto back their own interest-free currency. ‘Any group of traders can organize toallocate their own collective credit among themselves – according to their owncriteria, and interest-free,’ writes Tom Greco, in The End of Money and theFuture of Civilization. Such systems can ‘open the way to more harmonious andmutually beneficial trading relationships when done at a large enough scale thatincludes a sufficiently broad range of goods and services, spanning all levelsof the supply chain from retail to wholesale, to manufacturing, to basiccommodities’.LETS are a means for local communities to exchange goods and services withoutdebt or interest – without being controlled or influenced by multinationalcompanies and predatory financial institutions. They can also support newinitiatives that help build diverse, healthy, mutually supportive enterprises.Utilities that fulfil basic needs – like electricity or water – provideextremely stable foundations for community currencies, as everyone accepts thevalue they provide.I am not going to pretend that I have The Answer to the money problem. However,the work of Lietaer, Greco, Fullerton and many others suggests that we canreprogramme our economic operating system to reduce wealth inequality,incentivize conservation and increase cooperation – just as our current systemcreates artificial scarcity and forces accumulation, waste and competition. Thecurrent money system actually deforms human nature, which is innatelyaltruistic. It forces people to compete against each other in order to survive.Because human nature is inherently malleable, new forms of currency can reshapeour behaviour towards altruism, conservation and communal cooperation – in fact,this would be closer to our original, premodern condition.A new system must incentivize ethically grounded action based on long-termforethought over the pursuit of short-term, self-centred goals. We canaccomplish this by changing the reward system – but we will also need totransform our society’s values. Instead of the private accumulation of wealth,we must prioritize efficient sharing, mutual aid and the rational redistributionof resources. The share of global wealth controlled by the tiny class of thefinancial elite must be reduced significantly – but this can happen within aglobal movement towards a society that produces greater happiness andopportunity for everyone, including the 1 per cent.To replace the single monolithic currency, we require a combination of diverseinstruments for exchanging value. These would include community currencies,negative-interest currencies for global trading, Time Banks and so on. Newcurrencies – ranging from local to global instruments – would support equitabledevelopment and cooperative social ventures. The need for constant economicgrowth would be reduced if people were given a universal subsidy, freelyprovided with the basic means to live a decent life.Instead of moving towards a more hopeful future, we are currently seeingautomation displace millions of jobs, and this problem will get far worse in thenext decades. Our current economic system perpetuates outmoded forms of thestruggle for existence, and forces excess waste, unnecessary development andecological destruction. I don’t see how reforms will be enough. What we need,instead, is to launch a new operating system.What’s After Money?With the Internet, humanity now possesses a globally interactive medium forenhancing knowledge, building consensus, sharing value and supporting collectiveaction, on every scale. We are continuously connected with each other, globally.When it comes to engineering social transformation, this means we don’t have toundergo a slow, linear progression any more. We have the potential to supersedeour outmoded systems and institutions rapidly. We can bring about changes in ahandful of years that would have previously taken decades or centuries.In the short term – there is no getting around it – we must undertake severerestrictions in CO2 emissions. No market mechanism can help us here, as thismove goes directly against the capitalist system and our profligate lifestyles.As draconian as this sounds, I think we need something like a global moratoriumon meat eating, excess consumption and exotic vacationing until we bring about atechnical and economic transition. Surely, if we expressed it to them properly,the vast majority of our human family would agree that a period of sharedsacrifice is preferable to a total breakdown in the planet’s life supportsystems. The potential also is that we make a shift into a post-capitalist modeof existence where people everywhere work far less and have more opportunity forself-development.One way to do this is, I believe, would be through collective agreements orvoluntary social contracts. We merge the breakthroughs we have seen with onlinecrowd-funding like Kickstarter and movementbuilding platforms like Avaaz to askpeople to commit to changing their lifestyle for the benefit of the whole. Asocial network could provide instant support groups for people who wanted toshift to vegetarian diets, form solar energy cooperatives or engage in buildingwilderness corridors to protect threatened species. What would happen, I wonder,if, through the Internet, 100 million US citizens made an agreement not to paytaxes until the US redirected funds from military weapons programmes torenewable energy? The government might be forced to change its priorities.Globally, through online referendums, the people can ratify a universal code ofconduct, agreeing to follow something like the already existing Earth Charter,which seeks to define ‘interdependent principles for a sustainable way of lifeas a common standard by which the conduct of all individuals, organizations,businesses, governments, and transnational institutions is to be guided andassessed’. In other words, humanity needs to agree on a universal code ofethical behaviour that will align our actions as a species with the limits ofour biosphere.As part of this process of building a truly participatory and democraticplanetary culture, we must also design new instruments for sharing and storingvalue. We have a recent example in the partial success of Bitcoin. Bitcoin isnot perfect, but it proves that virtual currencies can work without a centralbanking system. Entirely decentralized, managed by peer-to-peer technology,Bitcoins are virtually ‘mined’. What this means is that each Bitcoin depends onthe outcome of a complex mathematical operation, which takes a great deal oftime and computer processing power to solve. Bitcoins are designed in such a waythat only 21 million of them will ever exist. This alone doesn’t limit theirpotential, however, as a Bitcoin can, in theory, be divided forever.‘Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer aunique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that thetransfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transferhas taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer,’ techinvestor Marc Andreessen wrote in the New York Times. ‘The consequences of thisbreakthrough are hard to overstate.’I know this is a fairly abstract idea, but since Bitcoins have no tangiblevalue, when you get a Bitcoin what you are actually receiving is a ‘share’ inthe greater entity of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is something like a distributed,leaderless and autonomous organization or corporation. This opens up thepossibility that we can use the blockchain – the underlying architecture ofBitcoin – to build other kinds of companies and organizations. The blockchainfunctions as a transparent ledger where all exchanges get stored and can bepermanently tracked. In theory, the blockchain could take away the opacity thatcurrently obscures many aspects of our financial system. Compared to theblockchain, the actual Bitcoin currency may be of negligible importance. Theblockchain could be the infrastructure for something like the resource-basedeconomy envisioned by the Venus Project.Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, calls these new enterprises, DistributedAutonomous Organizations (DAOs) or Distributed Autonomous Companies (DACs). DAOsand DACs can be based on selfexecuting contracts, defined by mathematical rules.It is possible to have ‘an organization whose organizational bylaws are 100 percent crystal clear, embedded in mathematical code’, he writes. This could be anew way to operate a non-profit organization, a trust, a media company, or toissue any number of currencies. As I write this, the first major initiative ofthis type, called The DAO (for Distributed Autonomous Organization), has raised$150 million from small-scale investors, which will be used to develop moreapplications using the blockchain.For instance, a DAO could be a worker-owned cooperative, or a network ofpermaculture projects, meditation centres or urban farming collectives. Thesekinds of distributed organizations might replace the current form ofcorporations, which are hierarchical, proprietary and profit-driven. As anexample, Doug Rushkoff asks us to imagine ‘a platform-independent Uber, owned bythe drivers who use it. There’s no server to maintain, no venture capital to payback, no new verticals or horizontals in which to expand, no acquisition and noexit. There are just drivers whose labour and vehicles constitute ownership ofthe enterprise.’ He points towards one experiment, La’Zooz, ‘a blockchainmanagedridesharing app’, where ‘drivers are co-owners of a transportation collectiveorganized through distributed protocols’. It is conceivable that every socialfunction could be reconfigured in such a manner.Rushkoff notes that the potential for such ‘platform cooperatives’ actuallyanswers the original egalitarian dreams promised by the digital revolution:The basic behavior of downloading an app in order to work or rent property hasalready been anchored in users by Airbnb, Uber, TaskRabbit, Mechanical Turk, andcountless others. Using a blockchain is just a small step further, compared tothe original leap into digital labor and exchange. It is the disintermediationthat all these supposedly disruptive platforms were promising in the firstplace.I know it is hard to imagine reinventing the global financial system. But Idon’t think we have any choice: debt-based currency is inevitably destructive,forcing unsustainable growth. We need to inspire people to become active agentsin bringing about this systemic change, providing them with the tools tofacilitate it."},{"pageContent":"13POWER AND LEADERSHIPI must have been around three years old when my babysitter brought Abbey Road toour apartment on St Marks Place. She let me peel the plastic wrapper off thecardboard sleeve, overcoming the faint, crackly resistance of static cling. Thephoto on the cover showed the four Beatles crossing a London street. John wore apristine white suit and sported a long beard. Paul went barefoot. They lookedrelaxed, slightly sheepish, somehow sublime. The image seemed to have a totemicsignificance. All of their album covers did.To my child’s mind, the Apple logo of the Beatles represented some cosmic force– liberated creativity, pure good – only just touching down on our world. TheBeatles seemed to foreshadow a happy future on Earth. Their music has informedmy politics – fuelled my utopian cravings – ever since.The Beatles conveyed the message that humanity was going to triumph, somehow, inthe end. I don’t know how this filtered through, exactly, or, even today, whatit means. Was it their particular mix of irony and innocence, formality andspontaneity that suggested this? Did their gentleness reveal a no-longercharacter-armoured or warlike masculinity – the victory of Orpheus and Dionysusover Pluto and Hades, of Eros over Thanatos? Was it because they embracedpsychedelia and Indian mysticism? Was it because they harmonized with suchirrepressible joy?In just a handful of years, the Beatles evolved from the pop tradition ofromantic love, expressed in songs such as ‘I Want to Hold Your Hand’ and ‘SheLoves You’, to the all-encompassing compassion, the universal love, in lateworks like ‘All You Need Is Love’ and ‘Let It Be’. In retrospect, one senses theimpulse towards communion even in their earliest melodies. It felt like theBeatles were messengers – angels of history, bearing news from the future.Listening to the Beatles, one felt that humanity was almost done with thehorrors of the past. We were ready to leave behind our tortuous legacy of worldwars, concentration camps, famines, depressions, gulags and forced marches. Thisdidn’t have to be a long, drawn-out process. It could happen in one sudden leapof collective will and imagination. It was imminent.John and Yoko, inspired by LSD and mass adulation, must have believed they wereriding this wave. Ahead of their time, they made a brilliant attempt to marketand brand the concept of peace. They took out black-and-white billboardsproclaiming, ‘war is over, if you want it’. They accompanied this by theirperformance-art bed-ins, exposing themselves to ridicule and scorn from themedia, to make their humble point. They were right, of course. If everyone onEarth had joined John and Yoko and jumped into bed, war would have becomeimpossible.A generation later, Apple popped up as an icon once again. The Apple of SteveJobs symbolized the union of silicon technology and human creativity. Thealchemical apple of Eve’s desire, borne along the centuries, touched down inLiverpool and Silicon Valley. We still follow the fable.The music of the late 1960s seemed to point towards an imminent insurrection –an electrified upsurge of creative Shakti, destined to remake civilization. Tosucceed, to become the new baseline, such a revolution needs a steadyfoundation, a strong backbeat. The radical movements of the 1960s failed toprovide that stability. In the end, they were easily dismantled by those cravenBlue Meanies who work behind the scenes, pulling the levers of the shadowgovernment and the military-industrial complex.‘We shall overcome’, they used to sing during civil rights marches – a profound,moving, beautiful anthem.But when shall we overcome?What are we waiting for?Wisdom RevolutionThe level of transformation required now is inconceivable without a change ofconsciousness and a new planetary culture. But we may be on the cusp of a wisdomrevolution – and it could happen quickly. As the futurist Peter Russell pointsout, revolutions in human culture unfold in exponentially shorter timeframes.The Agricultural Revolution started eight to ten thousand years ago, leading tothe development of a surplus which was necessary for the growth of cities, and acomplex, differentiated social system. The Industrial Revolution took aroundfive hundred years, with its roots going back to the Middle Ages. TheInformation Revolution – the linking of the planetary community together throughnetworks of data and communication – has happened within a half-century or so.Russell thinks we are approaching what he calls the Wisdom Revolution. ‘Thegrowth of human information technologies is taking us rapidly toward a time whenall human knowledge will be instantly available to anyone on the planet, in anymedium.’ Increasingly, he writes, we are connected to ‘an emerging global mind’.This is leading to a qualitative shift, first, from information to knowledge andthen from knowledge to wisdom.If we agree that incremental reforms will not save us, then we can explore howwe work together to accelerate the wisdom revolution, building the new planetaryculture necessary to support it, based on values such as empathy, responsibleforethought and resilience. Personally, I believe the media has a crucial roleto play if we are going to make this transition. We need to reprogramme thevalues and ideals of the masses. Most don’t even realize that much of what theybelieve to be true is just a programme that has indoctrinated them.Revolt of the MassesAntonio Negri noted that post-industrial civilization uses memes, narratives,media and networks to ‘produce’ mass subjectivity – to engineer a certain kindof consciousness. The detached, passive consciousness of the masses props up acentralized, industrial society based on consumerism, but has become a threat toour collective future. Now we need people to be educated, flexible, adaptive andactive in remaking our world. We must quickly change our social nature as aspecies as we adapt to new conditions. In the same way that corporations createdconsumers continuously seeking to satisfy ‘false needs’, we can create a newmodel for our collective and individual patterns of behaviour, based on theauthentic needs of the Earth.Writing in the 1930s, José Ortega y Gasset proposed that civilization needed tobe directed towards a collective mission – a goal that would carry theindividual, as well as the masses, beyond their personal concerns. Without sucha mission, society degenerates. ‘Human life, by its very nature, has to bededicated to something, an enterprise glorious or humble, a destiny illustriousor trivial,’ he wrote in Revolt of the Masses. Ortega believed that most peopleneeded to be given goals to believe in and strive towards.A liberal Spanish philosopher who served as a civil deputy in the second SpanishRepublic, Ortega thought civilization had lost its direction in modern times,causing a collapse of civic life. Since the Renaissance, Europe had establishedthe ideals and values which the world followed. But in the twentieth century,Europe entered a crisis of nihilism, losing faith in its own principles, leavinga void which Fascism and totalitarian governments rushed in to fill.He argued that some group – some subset of humanity – needed to lead, toestablish a moral centre, a vision, for the mass of people to follow and rallyaround. ‘To command is to give people something to do, to fit them into theirdestiny, to prevent their wandering aimlessly about in an empty, desolateexistence.’ As an elitist, he could be quite caustic in his views. ‘The majorityof men have no opinions, and these have to be pumped into them from outside,like lubricants into machinery.’Ortega thought it was the role of the elite to establish a civilization’s goalsand shape its opinions. The alternative was chaos. ‘Can we be surprised that theworld today seems empty of purposes, anticipations, ideals?’ Ortega asked.‘Nobody has concerned himself with supplying them.’ Today, the closestapproximation we have to long-range ‘purposes, anticipations, ideals’ is thecultural faith in the Singularity, where humans merge with machines or getreplaced by sentient robots.Although it has been 80 years since he wrote his idiosyncratic masterpiece, Istill agree with many of Ortega’s ideas. The mass of people are followers – thisis neither good nor bad. It is a neutral fact. Most people simply want to beshown a path to a good and meaningful life. They seek values, ideals and beliefsto give them meaning, hope and inspiration. As the ecological crisis deepens,the value system of capitalism will inevitably give way to something else. Wemust be ready with an alternative. Those who have integrated the new paradigm,the urgency as well as the great opportunity of our time, must find the courageto lead, despite personal faults and flaws.What I’ve been seeking to do in this book is to look at our current situationcomprehensively, and offer systemic solutions. I am aware that, up to thispoint, many of these solutions may sound somewhat abstract – or so extreme as tobe off-putting. One of my basic ideas is that we must learn from the ways tribalor traditional societies organized themselves for long-term resilience. We canuse our virtual infrastructure and corporate techniques to scale some of thesepractices for a global civilization of over 7 billion people. This doesn’t meanregressing to a tribal way of life, but advancing, based on the realization thatwe are collectively one human tribe.When we look around the world, we find indigenous people, who are among thepoorest and the most disenfranchised, on the front lines, fighting against theextractive industries, often at a terrible cost. To take just one example, thereis the fight waged by the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta against Shell Oil. In1993, 300,000 Ogoni staged a massive nonviolent protest against Shell’s‘ecological wars’. They managed to stop oil production on Ogoniland. Inretaliation, the government tortured and killed thousands, eventually executingthe leaders of the uprising.Many young people in the developed world – even children – feel the injusticeand the weight of the ecological destruction we have unleashed. But they don’thave the connection to the land or the basis in community, or ancienttraditions, that would allow them to mobilize effectively. Our culture is alsoincredibly good at spreading all kinds of distractions and deceptions that keeppeople from acting effectively, or courageously.I understand that, in our current situation, it seems unlikely, if notimpossible, that we can make the level of change we require in the time we havewithout some kind of miracle. As horrible as it is to consider, it may be that adevastating crash of civilization and a massive population die-off isunavoidable and inevitable. In fact, it is easy to imagine a range of terribleoutcomes, from our total extinction as a species through loss of biodiversityand nuclear war, to the survival of a tiny percentage of humanity in remotemountaintops and domed cities.Still, we must admit that if the human community suddenly worked together asefficiently as the cells in an organism, without the obstacles caused by oureconomic and political system, the current population of the Earth could – inlarge part or altogether – survive. Resources could be shared and allocatedefficiently as we innovated quickly, transitioning to no-waste, carbon-neutral,sustainable practices. Even if we lost 5 per cent of our global landmass to ahundred feet of sealevel rise, as now predicted, populations could be resettledon higher ground, with redesigned towns and urban centres featuring verticalfarms and rooftop gardens, powered renewably.We still don’t know what is going to happen. The schizophrenia of our time isextreme – the tension keeps growing. Futurists like Jeremy Rifkin and PeterDiamandis argue we are on the verge of abundance for all through distributedmanufacturing, renewable power and nanotechnology. Scientists say we are on thecusp of driving ourselves to extinction. I see the validity in both viewpoints.But I also can’t forget the mystical possibility – expressed by many propheciesand modern visionaries – that we are on the cusp of a phase-transition to adifferent ‘world’ or ‘dimension’. Perhaps this sounds far-fetched, but I tend tobelieve that, once we change our focus as a species, we will be able to accessthe latent powers of the psyche to bring about rapid planetary transformation.Two Forms of PowerWe possess working models for non-hierarchical, non-commercial societies in theblueprint of many indigenous and traditional cultures. The design of tribalsocieties reflects the wisdom of tens of thousands of years of socialinnovation, and trial and error. We can rediscover these basic principles. Wecan look at how various tribal societies handled power dynamics, for instance,while maintaining egalitarian communities.In Society Against the State (1974), the anthropologist Pierre Clastrescontrasted the power relations within the Amazonian tribal cultures he studiedwith the power politics of modern civilization. Whereas power in modernsocieties depends on hierarchies, secrecy and centralized control, small-scaletribal cultures reveal an alternative in which power is collectively shared. Ashe lived with Amazonian tribes, Clastres found himself forced to solve theriddle of a ‘powerless power’.According to Clastres, in tribal societies the chief was unable to commandanyone or give orders. ‘In primitive societies, in societies without a State,power is not found on the side of the chief: it follows that his word cannot bethe word of power, authority, or command.’ The role of the chief is to mediateconflicts, tell the stories and myths of the past, and maintain the stability oftribal life. In many cases, the elder women of the tribe – the council ofgrandmothers – had the power to remove the chief, if he abused his position. Theauthority of the chief depended on his mastery of communication, the power ofhis speech – not on his capacity for violence.Tribal societies, cultures without hierarchy, are the basic way that humans haveorganized themselves for tens of thousands of years. They are the most naturaland enduring social form. This kind of social system can be contrasted withmodern civilization – empire – based on domination, hierarchy and artificialscarcity, requiring constant expansion to exploit more resources. In the sameway that we can redesign our economic system so that it supports ecologicallyviable behaviour, we can reinvent our political system to be based oncooperation and sharing, on principles of nonviolence.In The Unconquerable World (2003), Jonathan Schell defines, like Clastres, twocontrasting forms of power. One is based on mutual aid, and the other onviolence:I suggest that the power based on support might be called cooperative power andthat the power based on force might be called coercive power. Power iscooperative when it springs from action in concert of people who willingly agreewith one another and is coercive when it springs from the threat or use offorce. Both kinds of power are real. Both make things happen. Both are present,though in radically different proportions, in all political situations. Yet thetwo are antithetical. To the extent that the one exists, the other is ruled out.To the degree that a people is forced, it is not free.Gandhi, similarly, distinguished between two kinds of authority: ‘One isobtained by the fear of power, and the other by acts of love.’Liquid DemocracyTo realize the still latent potential of our digital communications networks, wewould build decentralized, peer-to-peer systems designed to be perpetuallyevolving, supporting peer-to-peer production and social cooperation, making iteasy and hyper-efficient to share skills and resources. Politically, we wouldestablish something like a functional anarchy, based on nonviolent satyagrahaprinciples, to supersede the current system of military and corporate control.New social technologies would train people to make effective decisions together,based on consensus methods as well as ongoing referendums.Liquid Democracy is one platform for participatory decision-making where peoplecan assign delegates to represent them in different areas. Most people don’thave the time or knowledge to gain expertise on every issue. Using LiquidDemocracy, they can pass their votes to the representatives who they feel bestrepresent their interests, in different areas. Instead of a multi-year electioncycle, voters can take back their vote, and assign it to a differentrepresentative, at any time. The goal is to give all participants equal rightsin determining their political destiny.Similarly, DemocracyOS, a web-based platform from Argentina, is designed toallow for participatory decision-making on the scale of municipalities andbeyond. ‘We are 21st-century citizens, doing our very, very best to interactwith 19th century-designed institutions that are based on an informationtechnology of the 15th century,’ notes Pia Mancini, one of its founders. ‘IfInternet is the new printing press, then what is democracy for the Internetera?’ she asks. ‘What institutions do we want to build for the 21st-centurysociety?’ Another platform for democratic decision-making – on smaller scales,based on Occupy principles – is Loomio.org. Loomio is currently being used byPodemos, a grassroots movement in Spain.Over the next decade, we must make a species-wide effort at selflimitation,conserving oil, restricting our use of resources, until we have made a systemictransition to a regenerative technical infrastructure and social system. I don’tsee how this can happen under the current regime of nation-state governments andmultinational corporations. I also don’t think a revolutionary overthrow ofthese inherited systems is conceivable. We therefore need to create new systemsand supersede the old system from within – just as the imaginal cells within thedying caterpillar reprogramme the organism to make an astonishing metamorphosis.We can’t look to our current leadership to save us. We therefore need toparticipate in a broad-based movement of civil society. We need authenticleadership, and this kind of leadership could emerge from a consensus-based,open-source, peer-to-peer process, orchestrated transparently through theInternet. Just as we can devise an ecosystem of currency tools that supportecological restoration, so we can build a scaffold for direct democracy – wecan, in fact, try true democracy for the first time.The Occupy Manifesto of October 2011 states:As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the humanrace requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect ourrights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals toprotect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democraticgovernment derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seekconsent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no truedemocracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power.We can use existing legal structures – such as the International Court ofJustice, established by the United Nations – to slow down or stop the corporatejuggernaut. The destruction of ecosystems could become a prosecutable crime,following the precedent of genocide, which was defined as a legal category afterthe Second World War. The British barrister Polly Higgins has developed theconcept of ‘ecocide’ as a legal framework for protecting our remainingresources.‘Currently there is no law to prosecute those who are destroying the planet,’Higgins writes. ‘Instead, climate campaigners do not have the support of thejudiciary in preventing the corporate ecocide that is daily occurring under ourvery noses.’ Higgins argues that ecocide could be recognized as the ‘5th CrimeAgainst Peace’, a category which currently includes Crimes of Aggression, WarCrimes, Genocide, and Crimes against Humanity. This is a great idea but, likemany great ideas, it seems extremely difficult to pull off, considering theentrenched forces that will fight against it."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUECONCLUSION AND ACTION PLANimages [images/9781780289724_img02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONWHAT DO WE DO NOW?I realize the task facing us is an enormous and daunting one. But initiationsare meant to be difficult, to push us to the edge, where we will either changeor die. As part of this planetary initiation, we must unite the many movementsfor justice and liberation that already exist. We can inspire people by pointingto a vision of a post-capitalist future where abundance is universally shared,where science and spirituality have merged, where everyone has the time andopportunity to learn, live and love.The alternative – I get that it seems the most likely course of action – is afew more years of ‘business as usual’, then doom-spiral and catastrophe. We keepthe party going, pretend we don’t know the consequences, until we have ensuredthe collapse of global civilization, probably the crash of the biosphere and theextinction of most complex forms of life on Earth. I don’t think that is whatanyone wants.We possess the innate ability to analyse, understand and overcome ourconditioning. We can make the free-willing choice to transform our own innernature. I believe the only way we can change humanity’s fate is through ourvoluntary, free-willing choice as individuals to take on the ecologicalmega-crisis as our single-minded mission. When you think about it, there reallyisn’t anything else to do but this right now. My personal experience is thatonce you make that choice, the heaviness of the situation lifts away. You findyourself joyfully infused with purpose, and united with something greater thanyourself.When I have shared aspects of this vision with people over the last decade, themost common question is, ‘What can I do?’Somewhat ironically, I have found this a difficult question to answer. Onereason for this is that, as a natural anti-authoritarian, I don’t want toprescribe behaviours or actions. Another reason is that my eccentric tendencyhas been to think in terms of collective consciousness and social systems – tofocus on the macro level, more than the individual level. I believe we need asystemic overview of what is happening and what is at stake. Without this, Idon’t think people can make good decisions about what to do in the time justahead.But the main problem is that the scale of the planetary crisis is so enormousthat individual actions can seem kind of meaningless – until we figure out howto weave them into a unified global movement. Remember Al Gore’s InconvenientTruth? He presented mountains of data on the climate emergency, but thenproposed, at the end, almost ridiculously trivial ‘solutions’, like switching toenergy-saving lightbulbs (which I did).Of course, you can, and should, take all sorts of individual actions. Here aresome of them:• Become a vegetarian or a vegan, or reduce your consumption of meat to aminimum.• Cut down on air travel. Stop taking unnecessary business trips and vacations.Focus on creating local utopias rather than travelling long distances for exoticexperiences.• Give up your car, or share a vehicle with other people. New digital platformsare making this easier. For instance, Bla Bla Car, a European company, hasrecently launched a new ridesharing platform, which connects ‘people who need totravel with drivers who have empty seats’. This is a beautiful and simplesolution. It could quickly become a global standard.• Reuse, recycle, conserve, compost.• Buy less stuff, particularly new stuff.• Support the transition to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.When it comes to energy, there are many innovative companies moving into thisspace, all across the world. One example near me is Brooklyn Microgrid, which isdeveloping ‘a decentralized and sustainable energy management solution thatcombines the transparency and security offered by blockchain-based “smartcontracts” and currencies, in an emerging peer-to-peer economy’. Members andbusinesses can directly trade energy with each other, buying excess solar powergenerated locally, reducing their dependence on utility companies. Assuming thissystem works successfully in Brooklyn, the model could be replicated in manyneighbourhoods.Solar entrepreneur Tom Dinwoodie has launched an app, MyDomino, an ‘energyconcierge’ that helps individuals and businesses make the transition from fossilfuels to renewables. The service analyses their current energy needs and matchesthem with products and vendors that can save them money while reducing theirburden on the planet. This is one of many new products and services aimed tosupport the energy transition.• In the digital domain, support the movement away from closed, proprietaryplatforms that extract value to a small financial elite towards platforms thatare open-source, peer-to-peer, cooperatively run and democratic. Techentrepreneurs are building open-source replacements for mainstream platforms inmany areas. Lacking the resources of the corporate platforms, many of themstruggle to scale effectively. Two examples of social networks that could becomealternatives to Facebook are Diaspora and Minds.com. [http://Minds.com.] onMinds.com, [http://Minds.com,] all communication is protected from data mining,and content creators are guaranteed to reach all of those who choose to followtheir content.• Food: grow some of your own food, if possible. Sprouting is relatively easy todo at home. Windowfarm is an online platform that helps crowd-source creativesolutions for urbanites who want to experiment with food growing. You can alsoparticipate in community supported agriculture programmes that support localfarms.• Join a cooperative or start one. As business ventures, cooperatives aredemocratically controlled, collectively owned, voluntary associations of people.They are based on common economic, social and cultural needs and shared values.Some friends of mine in the tech world started a cooperative, Enspiral, whichnow has over 200 members and a larger network of contributors around the world.Individual members voluntarily donate some of their income to support theorganization, which is based on the mission of ‘more people working on stuffthat matters’. Their model is inspiring, and can be transferred to other fieldsand types of work.• Create your own media about what inspires you: With our smartphones alone,each of us is now a broadcaster able to spread ideas, stories and so on. In thebest-case scenario I can envision, at least a portion of the wealthy elite inthe developed world will model the path to self-sufficiency, sacrificing excess,choosing to address the planetary emergency as an initiatory path. Throughmedia, they can explain to the global multitudes – the rest of the world – whatthey are doing, and why.• Join an already existing, purpose-driven, social change movement. Someexamples of ongoing global movements are Transition Town, the ZeitgeistMovement, the Global Eco-Village Network and the World Social Forum. There arealso non-profits like Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace. I admit I amterrible at joining things, but many of these organizations do great work.• Join a community, or start one with your friends. I currently know many groupsbuying land or buildings together. Some of these communities are in Costa Rica,Nicaragua and elsewhere, Some are scattered around the United States. Some ofthese communities have business plans seeking to produce exotic superfoods orwork with local farmers. Some of them are ‘off the grid’. Depending on yourresources and the work that you do, it may be possible to join and support sucha community without living there full time.While many of my friends developing communities are relatively affluent,communities can also be started by those with modest means who haveperseverance. People can also activate and organize their local communities. Forinstance, the members of Avalon Village in Detroit, started by low-incomeresidents in an area marked by urban blight, are seeking to transform theirneighbourhood by creating an academic support centre for local kids, taking overlocal water and power services, and building an organic community garden andlocal cafe.‘Detroit has always been at the forefront of social change: the cradle of thelabor movement, home of the automobile, and now we’re redefining communitydevelopment in a 21st century economy,’ write the founders of Avalon Village.‘Urban farmers, start-up technologists, futurists, and visionaries of every kindare descending on Detroit to envision new ways of living and working in apost-industrial economy.’• Help disenfranchised communities. The science-fiction writer William Gibsonquipped, ‘The future already exists – it’s just not very evenly distributed.’This seems to be the case to an ever more extreme, even schizophrenic degree. Agrowing community of people in the developed world have integrated ecologicalethics. They seek to realize new business models and practices that supportprogressive goals. They are exploring freedom and spiritual development in theirdaily lives. At the same time, billions across the planet struggle to survive.Walter Benjamin wrote, ‘For those without hope, hope was given to us.’ There arenow 60 million refugees worldwide. That number may skyrocket in the next decadeas climate change intensifies. How we choose to understand and embody Benjamin’sidea is, I think, part of our spiritual mission and evolutionary journey,individually and collectively.• Protest or fight against corporate- and government-sanctioned activities thatfurther degrade the planet, impair human health, degrade collective intelligenceor hurt vulnerable communities. Sometimes, direct action is the only way tofocus attention on the failures of governments and the malfeasance ofcorporations. However, we must realize that these kinds of actions only makesense as part of a larger strategy seeking to move us towards post-capitalism.• Reckon with yourself honestly. If your work is contributing to the problems weface – exacerbating consumerism, purveying more distraction, extracting wealthfrom the poor – then change careers. Use your skills and resources to dosomething that helps address the situation in some way.UnifyI agree with Murray Bookchin that ‘green consumerism’ or ‘going organic’ is notgoing to lead to our salvation. While personal sacrifices can be important, thekind of commitment we make must be deeper.We must realize and accept that, while we are individuals with our own desires,we are also catalytic agents, expressions of a living biosphere. We can onlyenact our responsibility to care for and protect the greater community of lifeif we work collaboratively.Our indigenous ancestors understood this innately, as native people around theworld still do today. We can learn from them, absorbing their values as well assome of their practices, where applicable. The humbling realization that ourcivilization has failed to protect the most important thing – the Earth itself –could be the basis for a new alliance between post-industrial civilization andthose native communities which have preserved the old ways.We need more than ‘social entrepreneurship’, ‘conscious capitalism’, organicsections in supermarkets, and ‘impact investing’ – although all of these areimportant as part of the transition facing us. Ultimately, we need a structuraltransformation of our political and economic system, and this requires aunified, global movement of civil society. Considering we are racing against anecological emergency that could bring about humanity’s extinction, we need to beable to move quickly, without obstruction from outmoded institutions and brokenideologies.As I have suggested, this will require profound shifts in how we exchange value.The money we currently use – issued by central banks which are privateinstitutions – is corrupted source code. We therefore need new forms of currencythat support a redistribution of wealth. We also require truly participatorydecision-making structures, where people can practise direct democracy in realtime. Individually, we can participate in creating, applying and disseminatingthese alternative structures.Personally, I think we will need to engineer, eventually, a peaceful transitionfrom ownership and private property to stewardship, trusts and other cooperativemodels. Particularly I would like to see a liberation of intellectual propertyrights, so that all of our human family can access our shared resources ofknowledge and creativity. I realize this is not going to happen tomorrow. Theonly way to bring this about is through a change of the collectiveconsciousness. Such a change can be designed, or in a sense, engineered.We have to accept – I realize it sounds a bit creepy – that people’s worldview,their ‘subjectivity’, is manufactured by the media. The great mass of peoplehave already been programmed to be consumers and detached spectators. They havebeen deluded, indoctrinated, to act against their own best interests, instead ofbeing trained to think for themselves. The same tools of media and advertisingthat have been used so successfully to dominate and control the human mind canbe repurposed, transformed into instruments for liberation.A change of global consciousness will be accomplished, quickly, when we canenrol the mass media, social media, social networks and other social tools inaccelerating this transition. People can be deprogrammed from their consumertrance, their cynicism. They can be given a new set of values, ideals andhabits. I think that many if not most (if not, eventually, everybody) would behappy to embrace a new vision that infuses life with meaning and purpose.If you agree with this thesis, then it is up to you to think about your own lifeaccordingly. Where do you fit into the changes that need to take place? Whetheryou are an engineer, a lawyer, a pop star, a landscape architect, a chef, abanker, a pot farmer – or whatever – only you can decide how your skills andtalents should be applied. Each of us has a role that is appropriate for us.Social NetworksWhen I think about the systemic crisis we confront, I see that the potential –perhaps the only hope – for a solution is to extend the logic inherent in ournew social tools. We tend to forget that Facebook, Google, Amazon and so on haveonly been around for a decade. The Facebook community is 1.6 billion people,while 1.2 billion use Google regularly. This makes them also the largest mediacompanies in the world. Unfortunately, as publicly traded companies, they arelocked into the financial structure of global capitalism, fuelled by advertisingand the need for incessant growth.Facebook is a private company that happened to invent something like a publicutility – the twenty-first-century equivalent of the post office. In the springof 2015, I helped organize a two-day summit at Facebook on climate change. Intheir new headquarters in Palo Alto – a vast open hangar, designed by FrankGehry, with a green roof – we convened executives from Facebook, Oculus,WhatsApp and Instagram, along with representatives of NGOs including Greenpeace,Rainforest Action Network, 350.org and Climate Reality Project.I helped put this meeting together because I think Facebook could be anincredibly powerful instrument for helping humanity learn about and respond tothe ecological emergency. But to do this, unfortunately, they would have tobreak with the avowed ‘neutrality’ of their platform. They would have to takesides – siding with environmentalists and against corporations. This would hurttheir profits. The results of our meeting were disappointing, but perhaps therewill be another opportunity in the future.Imagine if Facebook – reaching a billion people per day – decided to broadcastthe urgency of the ecological crisis. They could put a panel on the top of everypage, speaking directly to their user base. The panel would say something like:‘Hey People! We are in an ecological emergency! We are all in this together!Here is what we can do.’ People could be enrolled in an exciting real-time game.Imagine if people were able to vote in Facebook groups. These groups wouldsuddenly be able to function like mini-nations. As an example, I started theEvolver Social Movement page, which currently has 2 million followers who sharemore or less the same values. If we were able to launch a campaign to boycott acompany like Monsanto (for instance), asking everyone to vote on whether or notto join up, probably a huge proportion of our followers would get on board.Currently, we have no way of reaching out to all of them. In this and many otherways, Facebook currently obstructs the movement towards a truly democratic andparticipatory society that the underlying technology innately supports.All the latest information on climate change, species extinction, oceanacidification and the other planetary boundaries could be presented and updatedin real time. Facebook could build an infrastructure for people to start localcommunity groups, including tools for voting together online. It could use itsgeolocating capabilities to help people share tools and resources, start localgardens, car pool – anything that would support conservation of fossil fuel use,reduction of CO2 emissions and ecological restoration. If Facebook won’t dothis, hopefully another platform will emerge to captivate public imagination –but we only have so much time.Although Facebook’s mission is to make the world more open and connected, thecompany is limited by its responsibility to its investors, and the vision of itsfounders. This is yet another example of our current predicament: we have thetools and technologies to bring about a rapid, even sudden evolution of humansociety in all of the ways I have previously discussed. But ourpolitical-economic ‘operating system’ is obstructing our ability to move asswiftly as we must.We need a virtual infrastructure to disseminate a shared understanding andcoordinate mass collective actions. Ideally, this infrastructure will beopen-source and peer to peer. We need to scale it rapidly, much like Facebook orGoogle grew exponentially. Alternatively, Facebook or Google could bedecommercialized – made into public trusts – and transformed into thisinfrastructure.Individually, people are highly susceptible to peer pressure; collectively, themultitude has a powerful herd instinct. If we are going to disseminate asuccessful alternative to self-destructive overconsumption, we need to leveragewhat we know of human psychology. We must create a tipping point phenomenon inthe opposite direction, away from unconscious consumerism, where making personalsacrifices to help ‘save the planet’ will become trendy, cool – the next thingeverybody has to do, like the Ice Bucket Challenge, if they don’t want to losethe respect of their peers.Many organizations make skilful use of the Internet for activism around socialand ecological causes. These include Avaaz, Change.org, [http://Change.org,] andMoveOn. But we must go far beyond engagements that end with signing petitions ormaking monetary contributions. We must find a way to engage people, ever deeper,in an ongoing process of transformation. Through a switch in social and economicpriorities, we must make building a regenerative and resilient society ourdedicated focus. We also must make it fun, seductive and inspiring.I like the model of launching decentralized, volunteer organizations where localchapters can be started simultaneously in many different cities, towns andregions. MoveOn has organized nationwide phone banks in this way. TransitionTown provides a model for autonomous local groups focused on preparingpopulations for peak resources and climate change. The 12-step programme ofAlcoholics Anonymous is an amazing example of a successful decentralizedorganization which propagates itself through a set of rules that anyone canadopt. Burning Man follows a similar pattern, providing core principles thatorganizers follow to create Burning Man Regional organizations and festivalslocally. The Zeitgeist Social Movement has launched local chapters globally,where people meet to explore approaches to system change.As mentioned above, I helped start a similar organization, the Evolver Network,which, at its peak, had as many as fifty local groups around the world – mainlyin the US, but also in Europe, Latin America and South Africa. We createdmonthly themes which the different local organizers could explore as they chose,ranging from psychedelic shamanism to permaculture to economic alternatives. TwoEvolver communities launched local currencies from their meetings, starting theB Note in Baltimore as well as a Time Bank in Long Beach, California. TheEvolver Network tended to attract the already psychedelically informedcutting-edge – the success of the movement made me think it would be possible todo something along similar principles, aimed at a much larger mass audience.The blockchain offers us the potential to create organizations defined by ‘smartcontracts’, where all exchanges are recorded and can be tracked. This couldallow us to build the infrastructure for a global direct democracy, in whicheveryone on Earth has the right to contribute to ongoing decisions about ourcollective future. Using blockchain, it is theoretically easy to build newplatforms – social networks – where masses of people can make collectivedecisions together, or sign social agreements, like personal pledges to becomevegetarian or restrict unnecessary air travel. These pledges can be backed upwith money held in escrow or other forms of capital.Realizing the urgency, we must look at all current institutional structures notas obstacles or enemies, but potentially as ready-made social infrastructuresthat can help transition human society towards resilience. To take one example,we can consider the Catholic Church. In his recent encyclical on theenvironment, Care for Our Common Home, Pope Francis calls for an ‘ecologicalconversion’ and shared sacrifices – particularly sacrifices on the part of thewealthy, developed nations – to create a sustainable world.Ecological ConversionThe Pope’s ecological manifesto gathers together many strands of Christianthought, proposing a new direction for Catholicism. ‘Once we start to thinkabout the kind of world we are leaving to future generations,’ Pope Franciswrites, ‘we look at things differently; we realize that the world is a giftwhich we have freely received and must share with others.’ If the ‘common good’includes the health of future generations, then Catholics have a responsibilityto make the planet liveable for those to come. This is a new addition toCatholic doctrine.The pace of consumption, waste and environmental change has so stretched theplanet’s capacity that our contemporary lifestyle, unsustainable as it is, canonly precipitate catastrophes, such as those which even now periodically occurin different areas of the world. The effects of the present imbalance can onlybe reduced by our decisive action, here and now.This reframing of Catholic belief provides an opening to make use of the globalnetwork of Catholic institutions for ecological restoration. Churches,monasteries and Catholic schools could be used to retrain the 1.2 billionfaithful in ecological principles and permaculture practices. Local gardeningand other skills can be taught after the weekly sermon. We can realize a newredemptive vision that encompasses care for the Earth – our common home – intangible form, in cooperation with Catholicism and the other major worldreligions. All the world’s religions anticipate a peaceful, harmonicreunification of humanity.We Are the Super-organismBy now, if you have stayed with me to this point – I know it is hard to readbooks in this era of shattered attention spans – you will understand myargument. The human species, still a work in progress, faces a stark choice: wecan continue our current trajectory and probably drive ourselves to extinction,or we can leverage the ecological mega-crisis as an opportunity to make amutational leap, a metamorphosis, into a new condition of being. By undergoingthis initiation, we learn consciously to direct our own evolution, and transformour relationship with the Earth. We master our projection of technologies,beliefs, narratives, memes, ideologies.Our mission, if we choose to accept it, is to bring about the next threshold ofhuman liberation – socially, politically, economically, spiritually. Where thebourgeois revolutions of the eighteenth century allowed people to trade, consumeand explore personal freedom, the next level of evolution-as-revolution willfree humanity from vacant consumerism and hyper-individualism. As we realize ourinterdependence, we will establish a global system based on mutual aid, whereeveryone is guaranteed basic security. As part of this process we will realizeauthentic individualism. People will be free to be – no longer surfing waves ofanxiety, guilt, status envy, fear; no longer driven to compete against eachother for survival.We know we possess the technical capability to transform our civilizationrapidly. No physical force prevents us from radically reducing our dependence onfossil fuels within a decade or two, and then eliminating their use, as wetransition to clean technologies like solar, wind and ecologically soundbiofuels. Similarly, the agricultural system can be transformed, and much of theworld reforested. Only capitalism – and human greed – stand in the way.As the ground crumbles beneath us, we have the opportunity to create somethingunforeseen and new – a meta-programme to reinvent human society, combiningaspects of a social movement, an advertising campaign, an open-source religion,a conceptual art project, a carnival, a nonviolent uprising. We can use thecorporate, commercial and communications infrastructure to propagatecooperation, empathy, flexibility and local autonomy. Every successfulresistance movement and counterculture throughout history developed tactics thatwe can learn and apply. What we need is something like a creative synthesis ofextreme corporate efficiency, participatory democracy, socialism and mysticalanarchism.Festival EarthWhat needs to be communicated is that, if humanity comes together now, we canthrive into the far-distant future. In order to do so, we need to make someimmediate changes in how we live. We must also evolve and change some of ourbeliefs and values. People need a vision of the future that is so inspiring theyfind the will and desire to sacrifice to attain it.I think we should reject the idea that robots and artificial intelligence aremeant to replace us in a monstrously dehumanized world. We should also rejecthigh-tech solutions that could have terrible unforeseen consequences, worseningthe mistakes of the past. At the same time, we can make use of technicalinnovation in fields like biomimicry, renewable energy and ecological farming tomake the world comprehensively successful for all. We should seek to master ourprojections of technology for humane and benevolent purposes. As Oscar Wilderealized, back in the 1890s:At present machinery competes against man. Under proper conditions machinerywill serve man. There is no doubt at all that this is the future of machinery,and just as trees grow while the country gentleman is asleep, so while Humanitywill be amusing itself, or enjoying cultivated leisure – which, and not labour,is the aim of man – or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful things orsimply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery will bedoing all the necessary and unpleasant work.I think this remains a valid goal for us – and is now an attainable one.I believe also that a deeper liberation of Eros will be an essential element inrecreating our global civilization on regenerative principles. I think we willsee a movement to build local communities that are multigenerational andautonomous. Those who desire it can deprogramme themselves from the belief thatmonogamy is the only way for people to have fulfilling relationships and securepartnerships. We can develop new relationship models and new ideals of love. Irealize this transition is already taking place – particularly among millennials– and for some of them I am stating the obvious. Sometimes the obvious needs tobe stated.In a liberated society where we apply our conscious focus to love and sexuality,we will realize many new forms of love. New relationship models will only work,for most people, as part of a systemic redesign that integrates cooperativechildcare. Beyond the nuclear family, we can develop new forms of community,integrating care for children and elders. As we reduce the time needed forlabour, people will have more time to explore fulfilling relationships of allsorts.This transformation will also require a new spiritual initiative that willsupersede outmoded religious structures. As Albert Camus pointed out, humanslive either in the world of rebellion or in the world of the sacred. We appearto be undergoing a polarity switch from one to the other. Overcoming nihilism,we can identity the seeds of truth in the world’s religious and mysticaltraditions. We can integrate mysticism with recent scientific discoveries thatreveal consciousness to be the fundamental basis of the material universe. Wecan see science and mysticism as two complementary pathways towards knowledgeand self-realization. We will then be able to live again in an undivided world,worthy of our devotion and care.The Outer Reaches of Inner SpaceI foresee two missions humanity can undertake together to satisfy our innateyearning for new frontiers and new worlds to conquer. These adventures willshift humanity’s focus away from individual egotism, competition and warfare, aswe seek communion with something far greater than ourselves. One direction is‘down and in’, exploring the vast fields of the psyche, revealed bypsychedelics, meditation and other esoteric practices. The other is ‘up andout’, investigating the inconceivably vast regions of the surrounding universe,settling in other worlds – as science fiction from Star Trek to Star Wars hasprepped us for.Dean Radin, a scientist who researches Psi effects, believes that we are at apoint in our investigation of psychic phenomena similar to the period just afterserious study of electricity took off in the eighteenth century. It tookscientists several decades to learn how to channel, transmit and storeelectricity – to turn it into a reliable current. Once we mastered electricity,we transformed the geophysical environment of the Earth in just two centuries.Presumably, we could transform the world once again, if we discovered a new formof energy, with different properties. This energy could be Psi, which scientistslike Radin are just beginning to explore and understand.We seem to tell the same story, over and over. In films like The Matrix, StarWars, Harry Potter, The X-Men and Avatar, the heroes must be initiated, trainedat a kind of school, to master their psychic powers. These stories could be morethan fantasy; they may foreshadow what’s ahead of us as we transition to apsycho-technic civilization. We will use our technical powers to explore andenhance our cognitive and visionary capacities. For instance, we will learn toharness subtle energies like Chi and kundalini. We will apply technologies,ranging from virtual reality systems to biofeedback devices, to upgrade ourneurological operating system. We will train our young people to developclairvoyance, ESP, telekinesis; to lucid dream and astrally project.We will legitimize the study and use of psychedelic chemicals and visionaryplants, bringing prohibition to an end. This process is already under way, and Ibelieve it is crucial. In April 2016, cutting-edge research on LSD was presentedto the Royal Society, the most respected institution for scientific discoverysince the seventeenth century, where Isaac Newton was president. Brain scans ofsubjects under the influence of LSD reveal usually dormant areas of the brainlighting up like a Christmas tree. Subjects ‘experienced images throughinformation drawn from many parts of their brains, and not just the visualcortex at the back of the head that normally processes visual information’,noted the Guardian. ‘Under the drug, regions once segregated spoke to oneanother.’ According to researchers from Imperial College, London, the evidencerevealed ‘the LSD induced experience of “ego-dissolution” results from increasedcommunication and integration across brain systems (networks)’. A great deal ofevidence supports the value of psychedelics for creative problem solving and forhealing of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other syndromes.I think it is quite natural that the investigation of the psychocosmos –infinite worlds within worlds – will become a central focus in the future. As Idiscussed in my last book, there is evidence that indigenous peoples like theHopi in Arizona were able to change weather patterns through ‘psycho-technical’rituals and initiations. Much of their spiritual culture was focused on bringingthe rain needed to grow their crops to their dry desert environment. Perhaps wewill someday understand scientifically how the electromagnetic environment ofour brains can influence the delicate ionosphere, and other regions of thesurrounding cosmos. Once again, I consider it possible that humanity hasunconsciously created the ecological mega-crisis to force ourselves to accessthe latent powers of the psyche. Psi abilities were known and recognized byindigenous cultures around the world.The philosopher Alan Watts once noted that, just as an apple tree naturally‘apples’ – producing apples in extravagant supply – the Earth ‘peoples’,constantly producing more and more of us. The apples from an apple tree aremeant to reach other orchards, where seeds will take root and produce new trees.Probably, as humanity reaches maturity as a species, we are meant to leave theEarth, bringing the biosphere with us, producing new orchards, gardens oforganic life, on currently barren worlds.Private entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Richard Branson have launched newinitiatives in space travel. These plutocrats have revived the great hopes ofthe space programme that went unfulfilled after we landed on the moon in 1969.The exploration and colonization of space could become a new collective dream –a mission for humanity, unleashing innovation and creativity. What awaits us isthe collective dream of an infinite frontier. Before we can launch ourselvesinto the cosmos, however, we must first pass this final exam the universe hasset for us.We can use the imminent threat of ecological collapse to awaken ourselves,making a quantum jump beyond our current state of being so that we can establisha peaceful, planetary home for our human family, protecting the community oflife – here, on Spaceship Earth.We have the option to embark on a utopian adventure that will satisfy ourdeepest yearnings for communion, self-actualization, creative innovation. We canlet the ecological crisis overwhelm us, or we can use it as our ‘cosmictrigger’, impelling us to reach a new state of being.‘I slept – and dreamed that life was joy. I woke – and saw that life was butservice,’ wrote the Indian sage Rabindranath Tagore. ‘I served – and understoodthat service was joy.’ Beyond denial, cynicism, despair and grief, we have theoption to embrace our role as agents of planetary regeneration, helping toredeem and restore our world – to find joy in surrendering limited forms ofself-interest for planetary communion.Undergoing metamorphosis means letting go of everything we thought we knew. Whenwe shed the skin of the past, we create the potential for rebirth into a newcondition of being, beyond anything we might imagine or conceive. Until ithappens, we can never know if an alternative exists that we can realize. Once wefree the butterfly from the chrysalis, there is no going back."},{"pageContent":"FURTHER READINGEcologyBooks that helped me understand the current ecological situation included TheGod Species (National Geographic, 2011) by Mark Lynas; Eaarth (Henry Holt, 2010)by Bill McKibben; Infinite Resource (University Press of New England, 2013) byRamez Naam; The Sixth Extinction (Holt, 2014) by Elizabeth Kolbert; Whole EarthDiscipline (Viking, 2009) by Stewart Brand; The Ecology of Freedom (AK, 2005) byMurray Bookchin; Hot (Houghton Mifflin, 2011) by Mark Hertsgaard; A ParadiseBuilt in Hell (Penguin, 2009) by Rebecca Solnit; and This Changes Everything(Simon & Schuster, 2014) by Naomi Klein.EvolutionI found the idea that our social evolution is meshed within a largerevolutionary process supported by many works, including Microcosmos (Universityof California, 1997) by Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan; Spontaneous Evolution(Hay House, 2009) by Bruce Lipton and Steve Bhaerman; The Hidden Connections(Doubleday, 2002) by Fritjof Capra; and Nonzero (Pantheon, 2000) by RobertWright; as well as the works of José Argüelles, Barbara Marx Hubbard andBuckminster Fuller, particularly Utopia or Oblivion and Operation SpaceshipEarth. Fuller’s ideas on design as an instrument of evolution were extended byWilliam McDonough and Michael Braungart in Cradle to Cradle (North Point, 2002).SocietyBooks I recommend on the changes we need to make to our social, political andeconomic systems include On Revolution (Penguin, 1963) by Hannah Arendt, TheGreat Turning (Berrett-Koehler, 2006) by David Korten; Multitude (Penguin, 2004)by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt; and The Democracy Project (Spiegel & Grau,2013) by David Graeber.Post-capitalismA number of recent books suggest we have the capacity to make a rapid transitionto a post-capitalist and post-work society. These include The Zero-Marginal CostSociety (St Martins, 2014) by Jeremy Rifkin; Post- Capitalism (Penguin, 2015) byPaul Mason; and Inventing the Future (Verso, 2015) by Nick Srnicek and AlexWilliams. I was also inspired by anarchist works like The Conquest of Bread (AK,2008) by Pyotr Kropotkin, and the Situationist classic, Raoul Vaneigem’s TheRevolution of Everyday Life (PM, 2012).FinanceBooks on how we transform the money system include The Future of Money (RandomHouse, 2001) by Bernard Lietaer; The End of Money and the Future of Civilization(Chelsea Green, 2009) by Thomas H. Greco; and Alternatives to EconomicGlobalization (Berrett-Koehler, 2004), edited by Jerry Mander.MediaBooks that shaped my perspective on media include Mediated (Bloomsbury, 2005) byThomas de Zengotita; Here Comes Everybody (Penguin, 2008) by Clay Shirky; andThe Revolt of the Masses (1930) by José Ortega y Gasset.Love and SexualityBooks that influenced my views include Eros and Civilization (Vintage, 1961) byHerbert Marcuse; Sex at Dawn (HarperCollins, 2010) by Cacilda Jethá andChristopher Ryan; Eros Unredeemed (Verlag Meiga, 2010); and Terra Nova (VerlagMeiga, 2015) by Dieter Duhm.Spirituality and the PsycheI found the idea that we are moving toward a ‘psycho-technical’ civilization inJose Argüelles’s The Transformative Vision (Shambhala, 1975). This idea isdeveloped in recent works, such as Dean Radin’s Supernormal (Deepak Chopra,2013) and Tom Roberts’s The Psychedelic Future of the Mind (Park Street, 2014).The notion that we will develop our psychic, supersensible or ‘supra-mental’faculties is central to the work of thinkers like Gerald Heard, Pierre Teilhardde Chardin, Sri Aurobindo, Rudolf Steiner and Carl Jung. Other influential bookswere Albert Camus’s The Rebel (Vintage, 1991), Frithjof Schuon’s TheTranscendent Unity of Religions (Quest, 1984), and Georg Feuerstein’s Tantra(Shambhala, 1998)."},{"pageContent":"This edition first published in the UK and USA 2017 byWatkins, an imprint of Watkins Media Limited19 Cecil CourtLondon WC2N 4EZenquiries@watkinspublishing.com [enquiries@watkinspublishing.com]Design and typography copyright © Watkins Media Limited 2017Text copyright © Daniel Pinchbeck 2017Daniel Pinchbeck has asserted his right under the Copyright, Designs and PatentsAct 1988 to be identified as the author of this work.All rights reserved.No part of this book may be reproduced or utilized in any form or by any means,electronic or mechanical, without prior permission in writing from thePublishers.1 3 5 7 9 10 8 6 4 2Designed and typeset by Donald SommervillePrinted and bound in FinlandA CIP record for this book is available from the British LibraryISBN: 978-1-78028-972-4www.watkinspublishing.com"}]
